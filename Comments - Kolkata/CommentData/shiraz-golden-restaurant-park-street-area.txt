I went there with my family cause we really wanted to try out the Kolkata biriyani. We were quite disappointed here . The biriyani was below average and it had a strong taste of Vanaspati. They do no serve raita with the biriyani so we had to order that separately. The quantity although was good enough and the ambience decent. But value for money ? No.

The lure for mutton rezala brought us here and we couldn't be more satisfied. As usual the biryani quality is a must to grub. The service was a little slow due to the crowd but it was worth the wait. Located at park Street Mallick bazar crossing this place serves your mughali cravings.

This is an age old eatery for Biriyani lovers and I have been visiting there since my childhood. I must say I always have a very nostalgic memory associated with it so whenever I visit to this joint I feel very comfortable and hungry as well.. ;-) . Though they do not have any special attraction about their decor but according to me they really don't need anything extra to attract foodies. Last time, we ordered Chicken Tandoori and it was perfectly cooked and tender. For main course , we ordered Special Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chap both were delicious though the Chicken chap was bit oily. Lastly we ordered Phirni and again it was very tasty. I must say this place never makes me unsatisfied..

There is nothing new I can add for this age-old eatery - this is an iconic restaurant in food map of Kolkata, conveniently located at Mullickbazar crossing on the Park street side. For the last 75 years it has established itself as the most famous Biriyani joint in Calcutta. We visited this one during or winter vacation to Calcutta. Recently after renovation it has become more comfortable and modern looking. On weekends the size of the queue outside it is quite sizable. The most famous menu options are Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Rezala, Chicken chap, Firni and Haleem. We ordered a Chicken biriyani, a Special Chicken Biriyani ( extra portion, one more chicken piece and egg as special addition), Rezala, Tandoori Roti and Carrot Halwa. Everything was excellently tasty except the halwa. The service was excellent and fast, seating was little congested but overall ambience was good. The price has increased over time but still is not overtly expensive. One special mention should be made for its fluffy rotis which is excellently soft. BTW, there is a parking place just opposite to the restaurant which is rare in such a busy junction. I would give a 4.5 rating.

Yesterday I ordered 4 plates Chicken Biriyani, 1 plates chicken Bhartha, 1 Naan,  the biriyani cost is RS 240 after taxes which is bit higher but when we opened biriyani packet we shocked the chicken pice was so small for your reference I uploaded one photo which is very disappointed and chicken bharta contain 2- 3 small pices with little bit gravy where they charged RS 225 for chicken bharta plate. So I requested please do not visit or ordered any food from this third class restaurent.

Went after decades to this iconic mughlai joint. We ordered chicken bara kebab and chicken 65 to begin our meal. Chicken Bara Kebab was not that great as it was too dry and stiff, whereas the cult favourite snacks of Hyderabad, Chicken 65  tasted quite good with the correct amount of spices. For mains we ordered Mutton Rezala with Butter Naan for my Father and Mutton Rogan Josh with Rumali Roti for mother. I had their Special Mutton Biriyani with green salad. The mutton rezala is no doubt one of their signature dishes but we liked the rogan josh more on that day. The rezala was good but lacked some seasonings for which the real taste did not come out fully. The Biriyani was as usual on point. Lastly we had  Firni and Gajar Ka Halwa and both were delicious.

Well nothing's much to say for this age-old eatery. The name's synonymous just like Sourav Ganguly is to Kolkata! So without exploring into details of it's ambiance and service (never expected something great), let's pounce upon the dishes which we tasted. 


We were a bunch of misfits. So we started off with a cup of tea which is very much weird thing to do in a place like this! Nevertheless the tea was good. While we were chatting over a cuppa, our food came rather disturbingly! You must be thinking why I said so! Go on read the rest, you'll know why! 


We, just "bheto-bangalis", ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken chaap straightaway. While some of us, the non rice lovers opted for something different. They took Tandoori rotis compliled with Chicken Bharta, Mutton Qorma and even Palak Paneer! Yeah you heard that right! What an audacity!! 


1. Mutton Biryani was usual typical of Shiraz. Greasy, aromatic and difficult to rub off your hands of that intoxicating smell once you finish it. 

2. Chicken chaap - God knows why I order this everytime! Knowing fully it's quite an average dish, I still go for it. A Bengali's issue maybe! 

3. Chicken Bharta and Mutton Qorma seemed to bond well with Tandoori rotis, as our misfit lots were licking their fingers by now! However, they were heard cursing the Mutton rezala (which they ordered later). 

4. After a hearty plate of biryani, my typical bongo tummy was full but mind? Not so much! So there you go!! Another order of Tandoori Roti and Kashmiri Chicken. Kashmiri Chicken was not at all Kashmiri left alone the white texture! Though it tasted good. 

5. Now coming to the abomination part. Palak Paneer! Yeah you guessed right! Total disaster as recalled by our vegetarian freak in our midst. 


Now, moving on to the dessert section, we took (like everytime) firnis and a Shahi tukra for a chaand-ka-tukra of our pack! Though she has quite a sweet tooth, still it pained us to see go through the "shahi treatment" alone! Firni on the other hand, was fine as usual. 

And thus concluding our hunger pangs! If you visit Park Street and happen to crave for a bite on mangsho, you can definitely give this place a try! If not for that, then do it for the sake of 'nostalgia', silly!

The reshmi kebab earned that one 1 star for Shiraz. Horrible mutton korma served with even worse potion size. Korma should be a mating of soft, fresh and tender mean with THICK, i repeat, THICK gravy. The mutton korma served was watery, bland and the mutton was a day or two days old. Cherry on top, it was the second coldest thing there; first being the staff's behaviour. If you're charging 400 bucks for a small-soup-bowl size potion, atleast don't try to fill it with half a slice of big tomato and and a boiled egg with a mere piece of mutton. Would not recommend to anyone. Maa baap ke saamne izzat duba di.

Delicately scented Mutton Biriyani piled over a softly steamed potato, with unapologetically greasy, robustly flavoured Chicken Chaap defines Shiraz Golden for you.
Definitely a paradise for Biriyani lovers and Mughlai cuisines.

Special mention:
•Chicken Cheese Kebab
•Butter Naan
•Mutton Pasinda
•Chicken Chaap
•Mutton Biriyani ❤️(Highly Recommended)
•Firni
•Sahi Tukda

Pocket pinch:
₹500/- for two.

Ordered masala kulcha, mutton biriyani from their special menu card, kadai chicken and for desert there was firni. Al the food items were so tasty and fresh. The filling was masala kulcha was awesome. The mutton of the biriyani was so tender. Firni was heavenly. Staffs are so well behaved. You should surely visit here for once.

All over the kolkata ,in special biriyani list Shiraz is alwz on the top... And their mughlai dishes all are just finger licking ..
Located very near to park street cymetry ..
We went their rush hour .. 10 to 15 minutes wait for sit ..
We atlst took our sit at first floor ..really royality on their platter ..
At first we ordered mutton hydrabadi biriyani .. bt that was out of stock ..so he suggested us Ambur biriyani ..
We ordered
Mutton Ambur biriyani
Smell of biriyani was too good .. just different from their normal biriyani .. which we like it .. as per their rate .quality was awsome bt not quantity .. one person was better .. 2mutton piece in .. mutton pieces were too soft..bt the biriyani was little bit cold..
Chicken bhuna
Perfect for nan tandoori roti ..
Gravy was just awsome .. little oilly .. two piece chicken ..
Tandoori roti ..
We ordered sahi tukra .. bt they can't serve that for some problem ..
Atlst they provide fingerbowl to wash our hands .. and in that was a piece of lime and hot water ..

All over made our dinner perfectly ..

Potatoes in biriyani were completely unboiled chicken pieces were only bone like stick..and I really have no idea what was there in mutton kasa. WORST 👎

Please avoid this restaurant if you take my opinion.

This century old restaurant is probably what got Biryani trending in Kolkata. But what I do not understand is why people combine this iconic Biryani with champ? The champ itself is a beautiful creation best paired with naan and the worst thing you can do to it is to combine it with biryani hence ruining both.

 The range of haleems they serve during ramadan is quite amazing which come in Iranian, Hyderabadi and Afghani styles my only complain being they are a bit runny.

Although overhyped, this place deserves none of it. Most of the dishes in chicken and mutton were unavailable. Still we ordered Roomali Roti, Chicken Bharta and Chicken 65. The Chicken Bharta was nothing like what we normally get at other good places. There were big pieces of chicken instead of shredded ones and also without an egg. The quantity was not good enough. A few of the staff kept looking at us throughout the time that we were there which was really uncomforting. Overall a bad experience.

Worst Biryani ever I ate in my life..!!! Not at all spicy. A Biryani without any spices is just a boiled coloured rice! And that's what I had. First time in Kolkata but last visit at Shiraz Golden Restaurant.
Pathetic!! 
Not just that but they did not serve any sort of curry or raita with the Biryani. And who puts a chicken sized uncut potato in the Biryani??
Completely tasteless, meant for making money only..

To a person who's visiting Shiraz for the first time, beware of their staff. They have no idea how to describe an item. Almost all items are in some way similar to each other according to these great people wearing suits. I would rather prefer asking the guys in yellow dresses for descriptions of any item. The Biryani festival going on currently(till 30th Nov, 2017) had been on my mind since i came across it in the newspaper a few days ago. Finally made up some time to go try out these new additions. I have always sworn by their mutton biryani and no doubt the regular items on their menu are good.
The biryani festival however according to me has turned out to be a big disaster for them. This can be attributable to their floor staff and their extremely unprofessional like conduct. They are least bothered about explaining what an item might actually taste like. Personally i doubt whether they have ever tasted any item appearing in their menu card. Otherwise how the hell will you explain the nitty-gritties of any dish?
As a person who has visited every south indian state and also has had every kind of biryani on offer down south i can tell you that a Hyderabadi Biryani is red in colour and super spicy. This makes it distinguishable from the other types of biryani. Shiraz however turned out a yellow polao like dish resembling an Awadhi Biryani look and that is their take on Hyderabadi Biryani which was also like a bit sweet instead of the usual hot n spicy. Fyi Hyderabadi cuisine is known for its extensive use of spices and chilly.
The other 2 dishes ordered were indistinguishable from each other. Saadi Biryani and Moti biryani. Super bland.
Only the Ambur Biryani turned out to be spicy and tasty.
The floor managers need to learn a thing or two about manners. When a customer asks the staff for suggestions after pointing out exactly what kind of dish he/she is looking for, it is the duty of the floor staff to understand the wants and adequately explain which item(s) fulfil the customer's criteria. When you're extremely unprofessional and do not give a damn as to what the customer wants and also have no clue as to what's actually on the menu then how do have the audacity to ask for tips? 
This after we had brought it to their attention that their suggestions were absolutely useless and they had absolutely no idea about what they were trying to sell.

Its one of the finest biryani servers of Kolkata, the biryani is really lite and delicate, tasty and you wont have to worry much about your diet..  We went during a festive when there  were  variety types of biryani being made, but unfortunately due to the rush we have to order the regular one... Nevertheless  we enjoyed our biryani... 
Also we ordered a shahi tukra and firni, both the deserts were really awesome...

Shiraz, the name is synonymous with Biryani, in the city of joy, where biryani brings joy to so many, everyday...!
I have been familiar with the name since I was a child. On most occasions in the past, we have opted for the home delivery option, while this time we decided to pay a visit to our favourite Mughlai cuisine restaurant. This is the main branch, situated right at the Park St. - AJC Bose Road crossing, cannot be missed. They have decked up the interiors and created the fine-dine look. There are 3 separate entrances that lead to 3 different seating areas, all serve from the same kitchen.
Food was awesome as always with bare minimum pocket pinch... Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chanp, Chicken Tandoori and Firni.
Burrrrp!

I didn't like the biryani at all it was like bland and no good taste, here you can go for other non veg dishes apart from kebabs and biryani but seriously biryani was not at good and I had biriyani two times here both of them were in different taste which means they doesn't have consistency or maybe the 2nd time when I had it was on ocation of Durga Puja so that might be the difference otherwise I didn't liked it too much.
The fist time when I had it was ok. Or let's say one time try.

Located beside the institute of neurosciences. 
Its one of the finest biryani servers of Kolkata, the biryani is really lite and delicate, tasty and you wont have to worry much about your diet..  We went during a festive when there  were  variety types of biryani being made, but unfortunately due to the rush we have to order the regular one... Nevertheless  we enjoyed our biryani... 
Also we ordered a shahi tukra and firni, both the deserts were really awesome...

Shiraz, the name is synonymous with Biryani, in the city of joy, where biryani brings joy to so many, everyday...!
I have been familiar with the name since I was a child. On most occasions in the past, we have opted for the home delivery option, while this time we decided to pay a visit to our favourite Mughlai cuisine restaurant. This is the main branch, situated right at the Park St. - AJC Bose Road crossing, cannot be missed. They have decked up the interiors and created the fine-dine look. There are 3 separate entrances that lead to 3 different seating areas, all serve from the same kitchen.
Food was awesome as always with bare minimum pocket pinch... Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chanp, Chicken Tandoori and Firni.
Burrrrp!

I didn't like the biryani at all it was like bland and no good taste, here you can go for other non veg dishes apart from kebabs and biryani but seriously biryani was not at good and I had biriyani two times here both of them were in different taste which means they doesn't have consistency or maybe the 2nd time when I had it was on ocation of Durga Puja so that might be the difference otherwise I didn't liked it too much.
The fist time when I had it was ok. Or let's say one time try.

The location is not so bad except the smell of mutton! We went there & went to the 1st floor during busy lunch time. Ordered chicken biriani, chicken bhuna and tandoori roti. I thought the chicken bhuna will be made of minced meat but it was not though it was very tasty.
The biriyani was good,the chicken and Aloo yummmmm . The firni was superb.
Staff are friendly.
Overall a good experience.
Revesit? Yes.I will.

Shiraz is one of the best mughlai cuisine in the city of kolkata...They served their authentic biryani since 75 years...
Direction: If you are coming from sealdah ,took bus towards mallickbazar...At the crossing of mallickbazar you find your restaurant....

Food: Now come to the food...
At first we ordered tandoori chicken as starters but the staff insisted us to take their special dish "chicken patiala" and i must say this dish was a showstopper... Absolutely mindblowing dish....so a big thumbs up for the staff....
Now we ordered their "Mutton biryani" and "chicken kadhai"..
The mutton piece in the biryani was tenderly cooked and soft....But i was very very disappointed with the taste of the rice in biryani...i dont expect this from them atleast..
Now the dish which killed the atmosphere was chicken kadhai...After having this dish i wondered where is the chicken??the pieces were so small and the dish was full of capsicum...
Overall the ambience was nice though and the staff was very good...

There are some chains and outlets which are synonymous with the thriving biriyani culture of Kolkata. Royal, Arsalan, Aminia, Rahmania, and Shiraz form the golden pentagon of Kolkata in this category.

Shiraz is one of the oldest, most recognized, and most popular brand names when it comes to biriyani in Kolkata. It was launched in 1941 as the Taj Restaurant. About 15 years later, it renamed itself as The Golden Restaurant. Further down the road, it finally came to call itself Shiraz - The Golden Restaurant, but to most biriyani enthusiasts (and, in general, the populace) of Kolkata, it is simply known as Shiraz.

Mutton Biriyani: Shiraz serves your to typical Kolkata biriyani, which is sort of a variant of the Lucknowi Dum Biriyani popularized in Kolkata by the exiled Nawab of Lucknow Wajid Ali Shah and his royal chefs. It is prepared in the dum pukht method, i. e., in containers sealed with wheat flour dough slow cooked over a low fire. Fine, long-grained, aromatic basmati rice lightly flavoured with Indian spices like cloves, cardamom and saffron is cooked together with large, succulent pieces of mutton, so that the flavours of the rice, spices and meat mix with each other to give you an amazingly delicious taste. The biriyani in Shiraz is much more subtle in its flavour and aroma than most other biriyani outlets. It is also has lower greasiness, but it makes their biriyani slightly hard and dry, and perhaps just a bit difficult to swallow without a gravy on the side. A large piece of potato and a boiled egg is served with your biriyani in signature Kolkata biriyani style.

Now, truth be told, you'll probably find a few places in Kolkata which serve better biriyani than Shiraz. And you'll surely find a lot of places which serve better kababs. But when it comes to sides, Shiraz is at the top of their game.

Here are a few sides from Shiraz that I've tried:

1. Mutton Pasinda: Thin succulent strips of mutton in a rich, spicy almond paste gravy, this is my favourite side dish at Shiraz. The strips are marinated with curd and soak up the flavours of spices and ghee (Indian clarified butter) used in the gravy. The almond paste gravy is spiced with rich, flavourful spices like cardamom, cloves, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, green chillies and garlic. The mutton and gravy are cooked in ghee, and you can literally see the red, oily ghee grease floating at the bottom of the container. The dish has an amazing, tangy taste, and the thin spicy, mutton strips simply melt in your mouth.

2. Mutton liver fry: This is a simple but delicious dish. It is basically lightly fried pieces of mutton liver cooked in a rich, spicy onion gravy. Tastes especially great with their roomali roti.

3. Mutton Tikia: This is an extremely cheap, but extremely tasty dish. This is basically a deep fried spicy minced mutton patty. The minced mutton is mixed with gram flour, eggs and onion-garlic-ginger puree, and spiced up with pepper, red pepper, chilli flakes, green chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom. Then this is mixed into a dough, made into a thick patty, and deep fried in hydrogenated vegetable oil. Simply delicious!

One of the iconic restaurants of Calcutta. This place serves some of the finest kebabs and gravies. Their Shiraz special tikka is superb. The Mutton stew is good with khamiri roti. The biryani is bland and can be missed. Do try the Shahi tukda in the end of your meal. Makes for a perfect dessert.

It is a quite familiar name recently shrouded by multifarious greenhorns. But it still holds a striking rating. I felt intrigued and paid a visit. It was during the Durga Puja. But I had a great trouble to drop by there.The address is Park street but its far from the park street metro. At Mallick Bazar crossing. So,taking a cab would be a good option.

We ordered Chicken reshmi kabab, a butter naan, Chicken tikka Masala and a Chicken Biriyani.
Gorging on the food my 'intrigue' get cleared. Yes,the dishes were delectable. Especially the kabab and Chicken biriyani. Biriyani was light with a fascinating aroma. Blended with perfect spices. The pieces of kebabs were soft. Tasty.

Conclusion: I think this joint maintains their consistency and thus enjoying a 4 point rating. You can try kebabs and biriyani here. You won't regret. Rs.750 for Two persons will be enough.

Can't even find a people who didn't have a sound named shiraz golden restaurant....Last Christmas visited with few of my friends ...and was overwhelmed with their treatments ..So let come to the main course .....they will serve you the best quality   mughlai meal .. ...you can find your requested food any time. And genuine price ..but the most difficult part to face with the desert items ..Whenever you have ordered the sweet for you ..then you should have a mentality that you were going to pay for ahalf of a plate .as the quantity was undoubtedly low and the price is much higher for the desert part ..but the rest of that meet with this age old restaurant will be remembered till the last ..

This is the Led Zeplin of eateries serving Mughal cuisine in Kolkata. I have had the Chicken and Mutton Biryani, Naan& Rotis, Kebabs, Mutton Stew, Mutton Chaap, Chicken Rezala , Raita and Firni.
Food- The first thing that strikes you is the quality of ingredients used.Right from the meat that is super tender,super juicy and fresh to the rice and the oil used. The food is light but very flavourful and all the elements come together to create an impact.The biryanis are subtle  and are not oily with a tender piece of chicken/ meat and the potato comes along nicely. The Chicken Stew, though not really a traditional stew, is a very balanced dish giving off all the right flavours without being too heavy .Similarly the kebabs are very well marinated and taste really good. The chaap here is loved by many but I dont because I like my chaap to be more cooked .The rezala and firni are good.The raita is super delicious.
Service- Dissapointing.The waiters are impatient and it is very difficult to get one's attention. Food arrives quickly though
Ambience- Pleasant.
Overall- A must visit. Its the city's biryani at its best

Shiraz. One of the jewel of Biryani in Kolkata. We visited the most popular outlet which is at near Park Street.We were only two so we order few items.

1. Mutton Biryani : I don't think I need to describe it much. Soft and tenderly cooked mutton piece.The rice was very mild aromatic and perfect.And this Biryani consists an Alu. :)

2. Mutton Chaap : Totally cooked in Ghee and the taste was good. But mutton pieces was too small and bones more than meat. (Chicken chap recommended)

3. Tandoor Roti : It was good and comes in a good size. One is enough for one.

Food: 4.1/5
Ambience: 3.9/5
Price: 4/5

Yesterday I had Biriyani from Shiraz and I paid an exorbitant price for the same including GST. When I opened the packet at my home I found that it was plain rice with a mutton.

I understand during Durga Puja no one can guarantee the quality of a food but can that reason will hold good for a legacy like Shiraz?? If that's the case then what's the difference between a roadside stop and Shiraz? If renowned names cannot guarantee you the quality of your food for which you are charged quite a high price along with tax then why would I be going there?

I am completely disappointed. My childhood memories of Shiraz has been butchered and I would never visit Shiraz again. I would also discourage my friends as well

I've been coming to Shiraz since childhood days. The taste of the food here has a nostalgic effect on me. It has a cosy, family ambience. The service is quite fast and the staff well behaved. The food here is delicious. Malai Til kebab is one of their specialties so one must definitely order that.
The only drawback is that they do not pay attention to the dessert. After a meal, one craves for something sweet and tasty. The firni was quite disappointing and the Shahi Tukra was very dry. It's a request from one of your regular guests that please try to bring variety of desserts and of good quality. There are a number of Mughlai sweets which will sell like hot cake. Hope to see my review to be taken into consideration.

It's located in park Street n one of the best Briyani restaurant in Kolkata. The dinning is casual, staffs are nice but the food is awesome. They only have north Indian n briyani and they are specialised in that. But if you are going in a group of 8 or more, u have to sit in two different places because they do not have such large sitting and they will not rearrange the sitting as the tables are fixed. This is the only thing that is not good about the restaurant, otherwise the food is really nice with affordable price.

Tried "special" chicken biryani, and chicken chaanp both of which caused indigestion and heartburn. Chaanp tasted completely stale, so did the onion "salad", which was exorbitant (atleast for me). The biryani was cooked with lesser oil than competitors, but all for naught as it is not fit for consumption. It might just be my singular misfortune.

Shiraz is the biriyani specialist in kolkata. Awesome taste. Ordered chicken biriyani and chicken chap. The taste of chap also very good. Really finger licking good but the quantity is low.

Renowned for it's mughlai cuisine and aweome biriyani this place is simply awesome. It's located near mullick bazaar. 
Coming to the food the chicken biriyani and mutton biriyani are absolute delicacies .The tikia and hariyali kebabs are awesome. The chicken kassa was good.
This is a must visit for all biriyani lovers.

Shiraz is a name that needs no introduction to the foodies in Kolkata. Their Mughlai food is legendary and the Biryani is renowned all over the city.
              We had Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chap, Chicken Kassa, Lachcha Paratha and Firni. The food was great and was successful in reminding us why the place is so popular. 

FINAL VERDICT- The Biryani served here is one of the best in the city and one must definitely try it out. The firni was also delectable.

Visited here yesterday, almost after 10 years.. My parents and I were more than satisfied with the food. The quality hasn't changed a bit. Infact it may have become better. Dishes ordered: Chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken tikka butter masala and phirni (the best phirni I've had till date)..
The quality and quantity both are better than many other renowned mughlai restaurants of Kolkata.
Hospitality:4/5
Ambiance:3.5/5 (Due to space crunch we had to sit beside the cash counter, but it was worth it)
Being a biriyani lover this place has become my recent favourite.

Visitied this much renowned restaurant in Park street area today for lunch. It's a treat from a friend and our experience is satisfactory. This place can be easily spotted as it's located just at a stone throw distance from the Mullick bazaar crossing. The dining area is quite simple. We got seated in the ground floor. Our today's food journey includes,
*Starter : Chicken tengdi kebab
*Main course : Mutton Kasha
Kadai Chicken
*Chicken Biriyani
*Dessert : Firni
Food arrived within 10 to 15 minutes. The tengdi kebab was awesome in taste. The chutney served with the kebab was complementing it's taste more. Biriyani was quite simple nothing extraordinary. Personally I think there are many restaurants in Kolkata who serve far better Biriyani than Shiraz. The amount of 3 plates of Biriyani can be easily shared among 4 people. Mutton Kasha was nice. Kadai Chicken was also good. Lastly the Firni tasted quite good with perfect balance of sweetness. Service was prompt. Prices are reasonable. Overall our today's experience is good.

Where : park Street, near neuroscience Kolkata
What : Mughlai 

Review : needs no new review. Biriyani is the lightest (less oily) and tasty one. Last time I tried Rashmi kabab, chicken kadai and these too were good. Just one complain that's about the staff behavior. Some one should not be so stubborn to get the tip. People should have more decency.

But will obviously go back there for the sake of good food

It's one of the best restaurants in Kolkata for Mughlai food. I have been eating at this place since I was 10 and they have never failed to amaze me. Their Britain is probably the best in Kolkata (What I have tasted so far). The kebabs, their chicken and specifically their mutton dishes will give satisfaction to your taste buds. If you live in Kolkata , you most probably have been here, but if you haven't please do give it a try.

They serve some excellent qualities of biriyanis and kebabs.
I ordered:

1.Chicken Biriyani: 'Biriyani ka baap', tastes good! One should definitely go r8ght now without wasting any time!

2.Shahi Tukda: A sweet dish that hone ur sweet tooth. A bread dipped in condensed milk and full of khowa kheer!

Along with these I ordered some kebabs and chicken chaap which are equally good in taste. I must say the Biriyani was one of the best thing Biriyani I had in Kolkata! Simple, not so rich, rice grains are long : PERFECT!

Firni was marvellous...

I have going here since I was a kid. I have seen this restaurant though all its phases. Starting with the time when they had a rooftop dinner place. It shifted to opposite side of the road ,opened a new branch but this place just to become better and better. If you're staying in Kolkata and you've not been here I don't know what you're doing. 

Now stop reading this and go!

I have always maintained that 'the Shiraz  biryani 'is the stuff legends are made of and very few restaurants match up to its superior taste.  Recently  visited  Shiraz with my family ,we ordered mutton biryani and rezala. The biryani was light on the palate but high on flavour . We were a bit disappointed  by the presentation  and portion size of the rezala served. The taste  though was top notch .we paired the rezala with piping hot butter nans to satiate our mughlai cravings.
Pocket pinch 600 for two
Ambience  :average
Service and presentation : below average

I’ve ordered take-outs from this restaurant a few times....the usual picks being chicken and mutton biryani. Once I even tried out their Mutton Pasinda – a boneless mutton dish, which was okay. The biryanis were good, though nothing extraordinary in the opinion of me and others at home.
 

It is in this context that I wish to share an interesting experience....a neighbour arranged for Shiraz’s biryani at his wedding banquet. It was a special order, because the rest of the food items were commissioned to another caterer. The chef came to the wedding venue with his own utensils & ingredients, and cooked the biryani there. Both my father and I found this biryani to be excellent....far superior to the takeaway stuff that I used to bring home till then. This made us ponder whether the chefs at Shiraz cook different grades of biryani for different occasions. If that is the case, they are doing a disservice to ordinary customers who are meted out food of an average quality.

Went there to try their renowed IRANI HALEEM. It was only 4.30 when we are told that all the haleems except their Mutton Shahi one was finished .
Highly disappointed, we settled on the MUTTON SHAHI HALEEM and one CHICKEN BIRYANI .

Biryani was nice though the chicken piece was not cooked properly and smelled a bit.

Haleem was nothing extraordinary. There r other restaurants nearby selling far far better haleems at the same price. For a price of rs.170 it felt rather pale- nothing but unflavourful thick stew with added masalas . The burst of flavours which is the essence of haleem was missing.
Ambience was noisy and VERY VERY poor . It was a very disturbing sight to see FLIES coming in n flying around .

The waiter who served us was a bit rude and he was blabbering some words everytime he served us which were not audible in such a noisy environment. When we asked him to hand over the bill, he said bill cannot be given as there was no tax ..N we paid 70+ RS tax !!! Then after a few mins as we were leaving , he came again and handed us the bill without apologising for his mistake !!! Common we don't need ur APOLOGY but atleast be aware enough of the rules expected from a staff working in such a reputed restaurant!

Not a very good experience. Definitely not coming here to taste haleem again . We pay SUFFICIENT TAX just like any other AC restaurant , so that we can enjoy our food in a good ambience without flies, noise and disturbance . It wud be really great if they decide to improve on that !!!!

You know you are in for a good time when the moment you enter the restaurant you get the aroma of the Mughlai cuisine. With a vast menu of lip smacking dishes, it was a major task as to what needs to be sacrificed.
After spending about 15 mins, I zeroed in on the Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chaanp and Firni for dessert. I was served immediately with a steaming hot plate of Biryani and Chaanp and it was absolute paradise. The flavoured rice with rich succulent piece of meat and a mildly sweet and soft potato felt like a festival when put in the mouth.
Each bite had its own speciality and would transport you to a different world. 
The Chaanp, I must say is a tender piece of meat prepared in spices and laid to you in a plate with all the juices. The Firni too was mind blowing. All in all a wholesome meal at a nominal price.

Not writing about my previous visits. Will only review the latest visit to the restaurant. Haleem is one of the Ramadan Specialty and being a Haleem lover have don't miss any chance of tasting it.

I have 3 of the Haleems which Shirakk offers.
1. Irani Haleem.
2. Afghani Haleem.
3. Hyderabadi Haleem.

Among the three love the Irani version the most. It was quite delicious and different from what we get as Haleem in Kolkata. Talking about the Haleems which I have tasted. 

1. Irani Haleem: The dal and gohst can be seen sperately here. I had touch of saffron in. 
2. Aghani Haleem: This is quite different the the dal has mutton gola in it. Never seen this type of haleem was quite delicious though. 
3. Hyderabadi Haleem: This the closest to the Hyderabadi Haleem in Kolkata. It is quite delicious and mutton and fibre float in the Dal as we get in Hyderabad.

Quintessential as it is to the Biriyani lovin community in the city,it's overhyped handsdown.

I had the company of 3 to this place.
We order Mutton Biriyani,Mutton Halim and Shahi Tukda.

Mutton Biriyani was par,given their reputation.
The portions were very generous though.

I dint like their Halim for the banality of its blandness.

The Shahi Tukda was all bogus.It was more of a two scoops of Kheer on a slice of bread.

But given it's location,the price is well-matched.

The restaurant started in the 70s and I guess I have been regular from the 80s. Shiraz was huge and well known at the time when Biryani was yet to become THE FOOD of Kolkata. It now has franchisee all over Kolakta and in Blore too!

They now have a hotel (Jameson Hotel) where it was originally located. Shiraz shifted to the opposite of the same road (Where Tandoor Mahal was earlier). It now stands split between 2 brothers. One is Mr. Atiquer Rahman!

What can you have here...well almost everything but try the Biryani and the mixed kebabs! My personal fav beside the said is paratha and Mutton Rezala! I love the mutton haleem (Called Daleem) during the month of Ramzan (Ramadan)!

Its located between the mullick bazar crossing and park circus road at the jucture.Since its ramzaan thought of enjoying some biryani. We ordered reshmi kabab as starter, Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chap and Naan for main course and firni for desert. The kababs were well done, the biryani was average didn't go well with my palate. But the worst was the chaap which was a piece of chicken swimming in a pool of oil. The firni was good. I didn't quite like the staff behavior also but they were more professional than the staff of other such outlets who like speaking among themselves even when the guests are having food...over all a below average restaurant.

Shiraz you just melted my heart. Your food is just awesome.
Whenever you go there or whatever you eat Don't forgt to taste Shirazs Halim nd Shahi tukra.
Regarding other dishes they are good.but can't say the best.overall a good place to make your tummy a little thicker.

Shiraz is the only restaurant which comes to my mind whenever I have a craving for mutton tikia and tandoori roti. The kebabs and mutton rezala this place serves beats down any other restaurants of the same genre. Easy on pocket and great in food quality, this restaurant definitely needs multiple visits !

My favourite mughlai restaurant in Kolkata.

Their biriyani is light and heavenly without being excessively oily.
Their lachha paranthas are the I've had anywhere.
Their chicken kadhai is absolutely marvellous.
Shahi tukra and firni are the perfect finish to the meal.

Do look beyond the biriyani and try the paranthas and side dishes. For those who find paranthas too oily, the butter naan is also good.

I visited the place several times. Shiraz is one of the best Mughlai restaurants of Kolkata. I love their Biryani and Kebabs. You will find lots of other Mughlai dishes too. Ambiance is OK type. Service is good. I like to visit their Mullick bazar branch in Kolkata.

Again a restaurant over charged me of Rs 30 for a 300ml cocacola glass bottle where MRP is printed only 15. When I asked why they are charging double? One of them said "you won't buy if I told you ablut the over pricing". So I am posting here to drag everyone's notice and also filed an complaint online against Shiraz Golden Restaurant

I have been here a few times. The decor and ambience is very sophisticated and the entire crew is very friendly and hospitable. Everything about them makes you feel at ease and peace especially if you make your way around the afternoon or so. But dinner time or the times post-sunset during Ramzan, it literally explodes into activitu and a busy hubbub.
The food is not very spicy at Shiraz. The biryani, especially the mutton one, is probably one of the best that can be had in this city. Theur mutton side dishes are really flavourful and the meat is of the finest quality and always happens to be tender and succulent. Their lamb/mutton brain curry is something of a stand out, for me. It's has a sweet gravy with the brain chunks being very fatty and gives a funny feeling in the mouth. One is recommended to try it, but at their own risk only.
I don't like their plain rotis much but the tandoori roti or naan and parathas are really commendable.
Shiraz has been golden for long and given their form, I feel they'll continue to be so for the times to come.

Special haleems on offer, like Mutton/Chicken Shahi Haleem, Mutton Afghani Haleem & Mutton Irani Haleem.
Pocket pinch will be ₹170/- per plate for the Mutton Shahi Haleem & ₹180/- per plate for the Hyderabadi Haleem, Afghani Haleem & Irani Haleem.
Rush in before 6 PM or you may return empty handed with a heavy heart!

Being a foodie, My love for biriyani is beyond imagination. It was quite striking that i had never visited a single Shiraz joint in the city. I had to change that. So when this week me and a colleague of mine had the urge to have biriyani for lunch and we just happened to be near park street. Thus, finally i was able to visit this famous biriyani house who are known to be among the pioneers of biriyani culture in kolkata. Coming to the dishes We ordered Mutton Biriyani and Chiken Chap witohout hesitation along with salad and a cold drink. Let me tell you guys it is no doubt among the tastiest biriyanis you will have in the city. The mutton was juicy and succulent. The rice had this amazing aroma. It was so tasty i was totally in awe. The Chap was also delicious. Even my friend enjoyed his meal. The quantity was actually fulfilling you know. The waiters are bit off beat. The service is slow. But i thank them for a reason because when we were about to pay and leave the waiter asked us to have their firni. So we orderd that too. And trust me guys it tasted mind blowing. Awesome biriyani and a yumm firni what more do we want.

Each and every outlet of Shiraz promises an amazing experience to all Mughalai/North Indian food lovers around the city. This one is no exception. Although the restaurant is rather small, it compensates that with the quality and quantity of food that they offer on the plate. Biriyani, Shahi Tukra and many other delicious items on their menu are an amazing treat to your taste buds.
The service is not the best, and ambience is not very soothing.

All this, topped with a greatly accessible location! I mean the restaurant can be noticed from across the road

Shiraz Golden name must be changed to Shiraz Black... shiraz special kebabs were really very special because  u can hv halfcooked meat like how u hv sushi...Horrible Biriyani... its more of dalda n less of spice... firni must have kesar flavour or any nice flavour but this firni is also special because mine was of exceptionally different flavour - burnt firni. Ruined my evening.

But birayani is not good as much I aspect else mutton dishes was good.

I went there long back with my friends. The decor is nice and simple but i was really disappointed with the behaviour of the staff. So we were a group of 6 girls among which one was late. So we entered the restaurant as it was pretty warm outside and we told the staff that we were waiting for someone and would order as soon as she would come. But they kept insisting and so we ordered without her. The food came pretty quickly and as we were eating the staff kept hovering around us as if they wanted us to leave, quickly cleaning plates when we had hardly finished and kept asking if we wanted anything else even after we repeatedly said we do not have anything else to order. When the bill came, we gave a fair tip but the waiter asked for a even bigger tip, his reason being "aap log itni der se baithe hai". That was ridiculous! 
Food is okayish.
Ambience is nice.
Staff behaviour is disgusting.
I would never go to this place only because of their behaviour.

My roommate manner with shiraz biriyani started at a very early age, from my school days to be exact. Visited shiraz tonight after a little over two decades and found the same taste in the biriyani. We ordered for a tandoori chicken which was quite succulent along with a portion of boti kebab. The boti was soft and succulent as well; however the seasoning was a bit too sharp with the salt overpowering the taste a tad bit to the higher side. The special mutton biriyani was simply delicious. Although I was a bit disappointed since raita and salads had to be ordered separately. In dubai, their branch serves raita as a complimentary addition. Nevertheless, it was worth visiting this place after so many years.

Bustling with crowd even at those early hours the place serves a scrumptious serving for a great start of the day. We had a couple of tandoori rotis with Daal Gosht, Keema Kaleji and finished off the meal with their special tea. Service is quick and prompt and the servers are very courteous.  Ambience and decor is simple and minimal and the prices are pocket friendly. Overall a good visit.

One of the most sort out names for Biriyani lovers before Arsalan took over the preferences. But this still acts as a loyal provider of biriyani to many of its customers. The taste of the biriyani is good but probably where arsalan is still scoring over it is the chicken or mutton piece it gives. Here the piece is not that huge but just abt ok types. The Firni was too good. The seasonal gajar ka Halwa was not up to the mark.

Chicken Reshmi Kebab is a pretty popular item. So much so that I have not found many restaurants indulged in having a mutton part of it. So when I got the opportunity to taste it Mallikbazar's Golden Shiraz restaurant I had a go. And My My what a lovely one it is. Absolutely melting in the mouth and super tasty. 

Highly recommending

We called and ordered and they hung up after taking order whilst we were trying to find out how much the amount will be. 
Then when we called we were given another number to call the Park Street outlet. There again once we checked amount and tried to find out how long it will take they hung up half way through the question.

Went to Shiraz for a weekend lunch. We ordered masala kulcha, tangri kabab, biryani, chicken chap, and chicken/mutton rezala for take away. Needless to say everything was extremely delicious. The experience was really great.

Awesome biryani and kebabs served. The food was royal and with the portion size - quite a reasonable one. Had chicken biryani and reshmi kebab, bara kebab here. Also their mutton stew needs a special mention. The flavours, spices with the juicy chicken can't be avoided however great mughlai places are here in Kolkata. Will come again and again for this taste.

If you want a plateful of biriyani with its own personality, go to Shiraz. Seriously. I can recognize their biriyani in a blind tasting. They have a distinct aroma and richness to their food, which is probably because of the ghee they use. This is not a biriyani for someone who abhors oil and richness. This is for someone who wants decadent mutton biriyani. If you want biriyani cooked with mathematical precision and perfection, Arsalan is the place to go. Shiraz's biriyani is the one cooked like a traditionalist, it's meant to be rich and oily. In fact, I usually need a gravy dish like chicken chaanp to go with my biriyani, but not here.
Their kebabs are also cooked beautifully with heavy aromatic flavours. Recently they offer chicken kathi kebabs, which pairs perfectly with their flaky parathas. Prices are on the higher end, but it's worth every cent.

First and foremost, entered the wrong Shiraz which is just opposite to the main one. But then after an embarrassing encounter went to the proper Shiraz. And it was lovely. Ordered Galouti Kebabs and Mutton Biriyani. The Kebabs were just butter and the way they melted in my mouth. Heavenly. 
And Biriyani never disappoints me in Kolkata. Whether be it Arsanal or Shiraz. They are just splendid. Also kudos to the quantity they supplied!

Shiraz the golden restaurant has been a gem to the kolkata's gastronomic scene since 4 decades. Generally biryani is suppose to be heavy but they offer a lighter version of biryani which is amazing in its own way. An array of kebab on offer. My favourite kebabs here are amritsari kebab and chicken bara kebab. Mutton tikia is also an item which should not be missed along with their crispy laccha paratha.
Talking about desserts firni is the best way to finish your meal experience. Thank you team shiraz for availing such delicious food over the years.😊

I have been availing the services of Shiraz via teleorder. On calling them up and ordering items, they confirmed with the cook for availability ultimately taking down our order. We ordered for 4 Chicken Biryani, 2 Mutton Biryani, 12 Butter Naan and 4 plates of Brain Fry.

The order for delivered to the doorstep in little more than 30 minutes and the stuffs were warm. Not wasting much time, we hopped in to switch on our party mood. I started with butter naan and the brain fry, ultimately ending by the Chicken Biryani.

The food was awesomely tasty and really justified the price they charge for the food items. However, I personally liked the Brain Fry above all else. It was simply too delicious. The biryani was good as it was not very oily but a little less spicy than expected.

A visit is recommended.

If you’re coming from sealdah, take the road towards AJC Bose road and you’ll find Mullikbazar crossing, from there, turn left and the second/third shop is Siraz. From park circus crossing, take the park street and the first signal after park circus is mullikbazar crossing. Siraz is at your right-hand-side. It operates from morning 530 AM- 10 PM in the evening on all days

Just get in, choose any of the sofa and order for the Siraz special biryani (eyes closed). This comes with 2 pcs of meat (chicken/ mutton), rice, 1 potato (the integral part of kolkata biryani) and recently they’ve started giving 1 boiled egg (god knows why). This is probably the second most subtle biryani in Kolkata, extremely lightly spiced, yellow and white rice mixed, its a treat for the eye as well for the smell…. forget about the tastebud. You’ll just fall in love with it by just the smell. I’ve been there probably hundred times and still am little hyper about this place. The meat size (for chicken especially) is a little smaller compared to a few other joints, but taste and aroma makes up for it. 

For heaven’s sake, please do not order champ with it, the champ, though being a great food at his own, just kills the mildness. This biryani goes extremely well with the mixed raita. The Siraz Raita is spicy, yet having the correct blend of sweetness (depicting bengali woman ??? ). They make a pretty good paratha and mutton kalia too, but once you’ve found the champ, who cares for the second place holder ?

Another quick confession of this year : this is my first time dining at shiraz being a south calcuttan and a true blue foodie; and well, i was quite ashamed of that initially but not anymore..
Without much further ado, lets come to the point straight.. i didnt like the food. Period.
1. Chicken tandoori: the chicken portions were too lean and slender. It seriously lacked meatiness. It tasted like the regular tandoori but didnt quite feel like one. 
2. Chicken biryani : it tasted okay. nothing impressive. Again, the chicken in it was "malnourished". Never seen such a slender piece of meat in a biryani before.
3. Mutton tikia: didnt appreciate the taste at all. The strong smell of mutton was hitting right on.
To conclude:
* i was quite disappointed with the food and so was my mother. (specially that chicken tandoori spoiled the mood at the very beginning)
* ambience is good
* good service though!

Shiraz is a very popular Mughlai Cuisine brand. It is located at Park street.

Ambience is good with ample sitting arrangements.

Service is prompt with nice staffs.

Tried Mutton Biriyani, chicken chaap and Sahi Tukra.

Mutton Biriyani was well cooked, aromatic , less oily , tender meat pieces and tasty. Quantity wasn't that sufficient.

Chicken Chaap was very yummy, one of the finest.

Sahi Tukra was awesome, enjoyable . A must for a sweet tooth.

Pocket pinch is reasonable .

*24th Dec 2016*
Moderately crowded restaurant and highly jammed roads.
Service:6.5/10 because I had to call them 5-6 times to order my food.
Orders:
Chicken Tandoori(8/10): Delicious and well roasted 4 big pieces of chicken(2 leg 2 body). Served with sauce and onions. Palatable. Each bite you take just melts on your tastebuds.

Mutton Biryani(8/10): They have reduced quantity since my last visit. 2 points less for quantity, they forgot to give potato in my mom's portion, poor presentation.

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala(9/10): A brilliant serve with 6 pieces, serves 3 easily. The chicken is tender and the ingredients sprout delicious flavour on every spoon.

Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala(6.5/10): (packed)They made it bland this time. Only the chicken was tender and flavorful but the gravy was too light.

Shahi Tukda(9/10): Next time I visit this place, I'm not taking any other dessert than this. This is superb. Tender bread soaked in the malai should be a craving for every sweet lover.

Firni(6/10): Taste-wise good but, it had big chunks of rice like you find in 'Paayesh' which isn't an attribute of firni.

My last visit to this restaurant in 2015 was still better than this one, with good amount of biryani, delicious firni and reshmi butter masala. The tomato in the salad back then was stale.

Gist : Recommended for Biriyani (less oily) and chaap. Just great.

I visited this place on 14.1.17 around 9.00PM. Easy to locate. A very big place having the seating capacity of 9*4 at ground floor and 7*4 person at 1st floor. Whole restaurant is air conditioned. Toilet is on first floor for a single person though they have 2 wash basin at ground floor. Ambience is good. Staffs might felt bit reserve but efficient to do their jobs. Ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chaap and Gajar ka Halwa. Within 2 minutes they served the biriyani & chaap. Both were great. Biriyani omitted the spiciness which I liked very much. After finishing both they timely served the dessert and it tasted marvelous. Just the right amount of sweetness and ghee I was searching. Great experience overall. Quantity and quality wise items are under prised. Will visit anytime soon to check other items.

Note : Only Arsalan is at par with their biriyani (kolkata type) in kolkata and vice versa. And For Chaap is a tie between Royal Indian Hotel, Arsalan and Shiraz.
Other thing is that in the restaurant, the tables were mostly empty. It is shame for a such great place. So please do the justice !

Shiraz is one of the best restaurant in Kolkata .. It has been that way since decades .. The Park Street outlet has a very good word of mouth and that was one of the main reason I visit that outlet more compared to others ..

Mutton Beti Kebab - Mutton Seekh Kebab and their Chicken counterparts taste really great and are safe bets ..

Chicken Bhunna is a showstopper .. I can guarantee that 99% people would approve that dish ..

Their Biriyani is famous but at this day and age 'spicy masala rice wala Biriyani with tenderly cooked masaladaar roasted chicken' is what matters and Shiraz's Biriyani is not that .. It is very well cooked and tastes good but it is just average .. They do not provide Salan which is a turn off .. 😎👍🏻

Firni - Gajar ka halwa taste rich and fresh ..

Nominal pricing .. Very good service .. Overall this food joint can get a number of visits out of you .. ✔

Shiraz does not need any introduction, this is a legendary restaurant in kolkata, one of the best restaurants for biriyani and mughlai food. Their dum Biriyani is mildly spiced with soft and joiucy pieces  of mutton in it. especially its flavour and aroma were excellent. The best biryani of kolkata in my opinion. Kebabs were superb. Firni is also good. Everything about this place is great. Its a must try in if you love mughlai food.

My favourite place for Biriyani would be Shiraz. Their delicious biriyani coupled with rezala and raita is a gastronomical delight. Mention must be made of their palak paneer which is one of a kind and I'd been searching for that flavour and texture of the gravy for long in other places but in vain. The kababs are succulent and I'd highly recommend this place. Price can be little on the higher side but it is worth it.

If BIRYANI is the king, then SHIRAJ sits right on the throne!!! Counted amongst the finest Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata, is my go-to destination when it comes to having the best quality Biriyani​. Located at the Mullickbazar-Park street crossing, the place is not much difficult to locate. Seating is available both on the ground floor and the floor above. Mostly​ order their Biriyani and shahi stew, a heavenly combination!!! 💞

⏹BIRIYANI - It's made less greasy and perfumed compared to the other popular biggies in town. What takes it a notch higher, is the use of the finest quality of the extra long grained basmati rice, always cooked flawless. The Shiraz Special Biriyani is a MUST try!😻

⏹SHAHI STEW - The Biriyani perfectly harmonizes with their in house "Mutton Stew" - the flavors of the gravy doesn't​ overpower that of the rice (at least I luv it that way). As turmeric is not used in this dish, the gravy has a grayish color to it, with tender pieces of mutton slow cooked with sprinkles of water at regular intervals, in a rich onion gravy and spices. Unlike any other mutton or chicken side dishes this one stands apart for its subtle flavors, sheer excellence!😻

⏹The Firni here, too, is absolutely delicious and adds to a nice finishing to the meal.

If you're in for a visit, would highly recommend the BIRYANIs, MUTTON STEW, KEEMA, LIVER n Firni.💞

Shiraz is the King of Biryani and Mughlai Food in my opinion and definitely serves one of the best biryani's in town.

You cannot stop your craving for the Biryani with one plate.You need a minimum of two plates to please your taste buds.

I ordered :- 

(1) Chicken Biryani. 

(2) Chicken Bharta. 

(3) Mutton Dopeaja.

(4) Firni.

The "Chicken Biryani" tastes royal and is a treat to have.It itself is so good that no side dish is required to enhance the taste.

The "Chicken Bharta" is very rich and filled with flavours.It is a must try and a beautiful side dish for the nun and kulcha and even biryani.

The "Mutton  Dopeaja" is very tasty and rich with flavours.Tje shredded mutton is so rich and smokey in flavour that it takes you high on flavours.

The sweet "Firni" is an absolute delight to have after your meal.It completes the experience of the royal and tasty food served at Shiraz.

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

One of the competitors of Aminia and Arsalan for the same cuisine... They are old and they keep their tradition going... Whatever be it you can differentiate in between the flavours of these Mughlai Giants if you are an expert foodie... You can find a little but unique difference that will tickle your tongue... A very busy place... Sometimes difficult to get accommodation at once you visit... Affordable price and okay service... Don't miss their Chicken/Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chaap...

Surprisingly Horrible food Quality & Quantity...........

I usually love to have Mughlai dishes from Shiraz Golden Restaurant only, especially when it comes to Biriyani. Being a foodie I am going to share with you my terrible experience which I had in the last evening. I bought one mutton biriyani and one mutton biriyani special from Shiraz last evening and parcel them home. At dinner time when we opened the packet it was utterly disappointing. The rice grains were dried, broken and not that long as we usually get from Shiraz. The mutton pieces were too bony, hardly any flesh were there. Last but not the least, the quantity which was just ridiculous. Nothing to say…No word is enough to explain my disappointment. I personally will never recommend this place to anybody anymore..........

Shiraj is located near my office , so I went there for many occasions .
During Ramadan , I tried their Irani haleem with rumali roti.
Haleem was mind blowing .
Their biriyani, chicken chaap, tandoori chicken, firni are just awesome.
Good ambience and price is okay too but people who are dieting would find the food oily and heavy but mughlai dish are on a heavy side , but once in a while is okay for dieters too.

FRAUD! Thats what they should be rated. Ordered a mutton biryani take away as I was staying at the Jameson Inn across the road and it was late in the night. The biryani delivered was only plain rice with a one tiny piece of mutton. Far from what one calls a biryani. No raita accompaniment. Can't comment on the taste becoz how does one rate plain rice!!

Shiraz is a household name for Biryani lovers of Kolkata. It's been an integral part of my childhood food memories. Great biryani along with other great North Indian and Mughlai dishes, Shiraz will hardly disappoint you. But you cannot be too health conscious here as almost everything is a tad bit too oily.

When it comes to Shiraz it's quite tough for me to decide wether I should write about the food, the memories, the first experience of eating out... YES Shiraz is the place where I ate with my parents at the age of 5½. Since then I keep visiting this place again and again just for the love of Biriyani.I believe this place server one of the best Biriyani in Kolkata.

Must try their 
Biriyani 
Tandoori chicken 
Chicken or mutton chaap 
Firni

800/- to 1000/- is enough for two people if you are starting with kababs and ending with desserts or else for Biriyani and Chaap it's only 500/- to 600/- for two to three people... depends how hungry you are...

This has been my haunt for over two decades now. The taste of food has remained the same (and that's a good thing!). Nothing beats the chaap (mutton / chicken), biryani, salad and firni combo. The chaap here is THE chaap to be had - most other places seem to have deviated towards a more "rich masala" version. Shiraj, fortunately has remained true to the original chaap. However, the chicken kassa  and tandoori roti combo works well as an alternative. I have also enjoyed the chicken tikka kebab that comes a liberal helping of chutney and kachumbar. For the gravy based dishes, don't forget to ask for an extra quarter plate to remove the oil!

It was a hurried plan & within a moment we were on our way to Shiraz to have our dinner. As it is always very famous for their Mughlai dishes, we asked for a Chiken Butter Masala and Parathas. Parathas were crispy and tasty too. & how could we have missed their Biriyani. It tasted just fine as it could have been but that Chiken side dish tasted yummy with the gravy with cream in it.
Beside their food part, personally I didn't like the attitude of one of their staffs. He was rude while collecting the food bill. It was not at all expected from the restaurant. It would have been nicer if this part didn't exist.

Visited this place during ramzaan, to have the halim, which was a complete disaster. The ambience is something I cannot say much as the restaurant was almost empty. Now coming to the biriyani, the tried to keep it simple, but made it so sinple that it lost charm. The tandoori chicken was something I really liked. Cooked properly and nothing special. The 2.5 I gave is only for it. The service was slow. Shiraz has completely lost it's credibility. And now is only a brand and nothing else.

Has recently gone a re-innovation in the past 5 years or so. Ate here the first time as a 10 year old back in 2001 if i remember correctly. It's been a long journey and they had hit a slump after which zeeshan and then Arsalan came up. Glad to see them finding their footing again.

This place is best for non vegetarian. No doubt biryani was awesome, chicken tandoori butter masala must be tried here. The place is within the budget, the only thing annoyed was the little harsh behaviour of the staff, otherwise it deserve to get a 5 rating point. Staff must learn to talk with the guests.

I have been to Shiraz many times.I think this restaurant serves one of the best biryanis in Kolkata.Rice is extra long, biryani has just the right flavours and not at all greasy.The chaap, rezala items can be termed average.Another item which stands out I think is the mutton pasinda.boneless strands of mutton cooked in nutty gravy and this item goes very well with the rumali roti,paratha or the biryani.

This is the parent of all lazzez outlets all over the city. The biriani taste has resemblance to other outlets,its good, but the quantity is a bit low comparing to arsalan or aminia,the gravy items taste the same. The kababs and tandoori are v. Gd. Try the rotis naans with gravy and kababs

When it comes to Shiraz, things you must try are:
Mutton Biriyani, Chicken kababs (all types), Mutton Chaap and Chicken Tandoori. 
Overall the dishes are tasteful but the above few are some of my favourites. 
Shiraz is expensive, the restaurant is clean and well maintained and the ambience is family friendly.

I haven't been here lately, but I need to write this review for higher reasons. This particular branch of Shiraz is where I ate my FIRST biryani.

This is where it all started and I've never stopped loving biriyani after that, and I owe it to Shiraz. Their biriyani was a plate of heaven served to me from the gods. (I might be exaggerating a tad bit, but, come on.)

I will always remember that day, we were around 15 of us, everyone ordered one biriyani and one chicken chaap and one coke. Perfect combo, went home and slept for atleast 6 hours (Not exaggerating)

Shiraz needs no introduction when it comes to Biryani and Indian food. 

This is the oldest outlet located near Mullick bazar which has been renovated in recent years.

Though I have been here on multiple occasions, I am writing today about a recent visit.

Me along with a very close friend came down at around 11:30 at night on a Sunday looking for some heavy dinner while we were at Neotia hospital nearby. On asking for a table at first they were a little confused, as it was pretty late but quickly gave us a table and took our order. As it was late the only option available was Biryani and along with that the Mutton Kassa was our side dish which was flown out of kitchen just at the blink of an eye. 

Huge quantity on the plate with soft mutton pieces along and a big alo made it a lip smacking affair. Wow!!! Even if I am not a Biryani lover just loved it.  The mutton kassa was made very light and did absolute justice as a side dish. Loved it totally and thus once again they proved why they have been carrying forward the legacy with them. Much appreciated !!!

Imagine yourself to be a fan of mughal dishes, such as me (think huge). Now think of all of the most delicious flavours you want to ever taste in your life. Take those all together, ugh! you have the murgh musallam of this place! Ok enough with the PPAP cover. Shiraz is one of the best biriyani outlets in Kolkata and if you've tasted it, you don't need zomato to tell you it's legendary. This was my 2nd visit to this place, and i don't really know why i didn't write the review the 1st time (don't look at me like that :|). Shiraz does try to maintain some high standards with respect to not only their cooking but also service and ambience, however one thing that hurts that is a small part of the crowd that visits this place (i'm only talking about those who ogle others' food and murmur the names of the dishes which you have ordered while sitting at neighbouring tables, making you feel incredibly awkward...the rest of you are absolute darlings). The interior deco and table arrangement is all pretty nice. The service is really good with polite and helpful waiters and is pretty prompt. Now coming to the food. Biriyani over here is brilliant. I absolutely love it and I really feel it's one of the best you can find in Kolkata. But today was about something way more special - Murgh Musallam, that one dish that combines all layers and folds and niches of epicness in itself, and amplifies it to a mindblowing creation of human kind. Now the dish has to be ordered beforehand (i ordered about a day ahead, but i believe that's not the minimum limit), with the procedure followed here being pretty easy and straightforward: go, order, pay an amount as advance, and try to keep a leash on your salivary glands while you wait. I promise you won't be disappointed. The chicken was well cooked, nice and juicy and succulent, and the taste! It's all of those flavours you may crave for in mughal salans, stimulating taste buds slowly and in the most heavenly torture possible. Also, the egg inside is cooked separately and has a very low probability of being that chicken's own egg. Yes i had someone who was confused. All jokes apart, they said it was their specialty. They delivered. And they made the experience really special for us while they were at it.

Its an old inveterate famous restaurant known for the rich taste of its dishes. If you have a fetish for Mughlai cuisine, one must definitely try out this place to cherish some sterling and exceptional food.

Its located in Mullickbazaar crossing and is always on high demand for its reputation over the years. Its a two storey AC restaurant not much to do with the decor. But its really difficult to get a place and the most coveted dishes are always sold out quickly.

Driven by the speciality of this restaurant we decided on our order list. We took tandoori chicken, chicken reshmi kabab, butter naan, tandoori roti, mutton rezala, chicken rezala and chicken biriyani acompanied with green salad.

Tandoori chicken was simply mouth watering. It had the right marination and blend of spices which made the dish palatable. The rezalas were empyrean and blissful. It was so well cooked that you cant resist yourself from going on relishing it. Both the chicken and mutton was tender and succulent but the broth was to die for.
After rejoicing the dish, we took the biriyani. It was quite nice but the rezalla stole the show. The butter naan was very supple and lisome and could be easily ripped off. To be very honest, each of the items was worth praising.
I feel its one of the best place to cherish some delicious food and you should go with a good apetite to enjoy its flavourous dishes. Would surely visit this place again whenever I an there in Kolkata.

Shiraz is yet another classic food joint specialising in Mughlai cuisine. They have number of outlets throughout Kolkata among which Park Street joint is one. Their Biryani is pretty good & Haleem is legendary. But you probably won't get it except for the time of Ramadan month I think. Their options of Kebabs & Rolls are what attracts me most. I visit this place from Time to Time. Next time I go there definitely will get some photos :P . For now its a 3.5/5 place.

Been here many times.. first review for this restaurant.. :-) it's one of the legendary mughlai restaurant of the town.. :-)

Location :- Beside Institute of neuroscience.. park street mullickbajar crossing.. :-) 

Ambience :- A well decorated restaurant with bright lights and good ambience...

Food :- Now coming to the food we ordered Chicken Tandoori as starters... 

1) Chicken Tandoori :- The best Tandoori Chicken in town.. I come to this place again and again for this.. The smoky flavour.. The tenderness of the chicken... The Green sauce accompanying it just takes me out of the world... "awesome" is the only word I can say...

2)Mutton biriyani :- biriyani is just something heavenly... mmm... The taste ... The aroma... everything is just superb... 

3) Chicken kadhai :- Another traditional dish.. well coked the gravy was tasty..

4) mutton chap :- one of the signature dishes of Shiraz... and one of my all time favourite... :-) 

To finish the dinner we had Firni.. which was also good but I found the Firni of aminia a bit better and more tasty... 

Overall a great experience.. must visit place for all biriyani lovers.. :-) 

Service was prompt.. The staffs were polite.. :-)

In terms of taste, there can be absolutely no complaint for Shiraz - they have been producing the best Mughlai in Kolkata for quite some time now. What is extremely disappointing however, is that their quantities have been decreasing, while the prices have been increasing. This is a great place for Mughlai, but only if you are willing to return with an empty wallet, and a half-filled stomach.

Much heard about this place. Went there at puja. The decoration was average. The foods were served in 10-15 minutes after ordering.
 things we tried:
1. mutton biryani- it was served with a piece of potato, one piece of mutton. Very high in quantity. very classic in taste.

2. Mutton Irani chaap - very delicious. I found the oil a bit high here, yet I guess the oil increased its taste. Peas, egg whites were with it. Was boiled very well and tastes yummy.

Must try here no matter if you're a mughlai cuisine lover or not. We shall be very happy to come here once more.

When we talk about biriyani in kolkata shiraz cannot be ignored. Being an ardent biriyani lover the name is enough to bring smiles to my face. Went to their outlet with a friend to get that epic biriyani feel. The decor in tbe ground floor was a bit more elegant than the 1st floor which was quite simple. We were taken to the 1st floor. We ordered chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani and chicken dopyaza. I liked the promt actions of the waiters. We were served in about 10mins. The biriyani was so good. It was light with minimum oil. It was very tasty with all the right quantity of ingrediants. The mutton and the chicken pieces were well cooked and soft. The chicken dopyaza was average but i have no complaints as such. Overall a very good experience.

Always ordered food at home from shiraz. Always a decent experience. Today i visited the restaurant after years. And it was a total disappointment. Food was pathetically cold. Arrogant rude waiters. Worthless service. 
Ordered biryani. It was tasteless. So i asked the waiter to get some chatni, the green one they serve with kebabs.
2 seperate waiters were told. And i was told its over. The waiter asked there head person (waiter no.19) and he rude and loudly replied, tell him we dont give it with biryani, dont you know..
He was pretty arrogant and rude.
I could see it was there. They didnt want to offer it complimentary they can ask for a charge. 
Not show their cheap class attitude.
Moreover.. i can pay 225 for a plate of tasteless cold biryani. Charge me whatever you want for something which can make that 225 edible.
Total disappointment.
Not recommended ever.
No more home orders either.
I promise my fellow foodies. No1 i know will ever visit that place to take their shi**y tantrums ever..

A mouth watering Biriyani after a long time!! Located in prime location with reasonable price. We tried Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Shahi Tukra. More than the Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala worth a special mention. Smoky smell and delicious gravy! Shahi Tukra was upto@ the mark. Bit disappointed with the size of mutton chap though, and it was not well washed as I found a pelage in it.

Everyone know it's famous for it's biryani but I loved the tandoori chicken here more than the biryani. 
Other than that, it's a nice place to dine in. I would recommend this place for tandoori chicken.

Simply reach out there for biriyani. If you are a biriyani lover, it's a must hop in place. Combine with mutton resala or bheja/lever curry.

One of the oldest biriyani place in kolkata we were in park street for business purpose so we decided to hav a go in shiraz
Coming to the food we ordered-:

Chicken biriyani,mutton biriyani,mutton kasa & tandoori roti

Biriyani tastes really good nd it was on a lighter side as well not too many  masalas ndd much lesser oil of course itt just the way i like it but people who like biriyani on the heavier side with too many spicy masalas i am sure u will not be satisfied with shiraz biriyani,Mutton kasa was just mouth watering it tastes so good that i cant describe must hav dish in shiraz nd Tandoori roti was thick nd was on the bigger side an average person can hav 1-2 max 
If u like biriyani just go out there nd hav some nd you will know why shiraz is shiraz

You'll understand the difference between all other Shiraz outlets and this one when you eat here. While most of the outlets have deteriorated over time this one has gotten better. The biryani is so very delicious, and the chaap mind blowing. This is the Shiraz flagship store and this is holding its ground for good.

This is one of the best places in Kolkata if you want to taste the Mughlai or Awadhi cuisine. The biryani is very nice and considered as one of the best served in the city. However, Halim is the most fascinating dish I used have here, which is available only in the month of Ramadan.

The flag bearer of the Shiraz name. While other outlets bearing the name have deteriorated over time, nice to be served the same great Biriyani and Chaap every single time. Each bite is worthy of the famous name !!Advise: Do not wait in the long queues outside of Arsalan at 7 point - the Biriyani at Shiraj is every bit as good sans the maddening rush !!

Every Kolkatan has their favourite briyani joint, and for me its Shiraz (sorry Arsalan!) For one, Shiraz's briyani is way less greasy and isnt as heavily perfumed with rose oil, as it is at most other places. Both of which I highly appreciate. Secondly, all of their side dishes (gravies), be it chicken bharta, chicken chap, chicken khadai, mutton pasinda, mutton chap, are excellent and go so well with the briyani. And finally, the melt-in-the-mouth kebabas have never failed me.

It was my first time at this place. We've been planning since quite a long time for Shiraz and to taste their special biriyani and chicken rezala. Biriyani was good. I liked the chicken rezala and chicken tikka butter masala very much. Those were delicious. The ambience was so so.... But thing that I didn't like @about this place was the behavior of the staffs. I don't know what was their problem, them seemed quite irritated while serving us. That thing was not good at all about this place. I would've given 4 if I haven't faced this issue.

If you study in any one of the nearby colleges then birthday treats often lead you to Shiraz. The biriyani here is a classic and rightly so, it's delightful. The kebabs taste just fine, and the side dishes are amazing. I had my first phirni here, it might not be the best, but nostalgia leaves me a tad biased. Prices aren't extravagant, you can have a proper meal even if you're on a really tight budget. If love for biriyani isn't cutting it for you, then drop by to have rotis and parathas. Or maybe to visit a legend among Kolkata eateries.

Great quality of mughlai food in reasonable price and along with that good old tradition of Kolkata. 
We had mutton biriyani, chicken bharta, and rumali roti for main course and firni for desert. Shiraz makes their biriyani with good amount of speciality. It's just yummy. The chicken bharta was also quite good in taste. Firni was equally good. 
The ambience and staffs are welcoming and welbehaving.
Overall a nice experience.

I visited this place with some of my college mates after my 2nd proff theory exams. And it was a great place to cheer us all up after some gruelling papers!Now coming to the food, we ordered for biriyanis, parathas, rolls and other side dishes.The biriyani, needless to say, is one of the best in Kolkata. Other dishes were good too. Their raita was good. I have always liked the raita of Shiraz.Prices are alright. Unfortunately Firni was not available for dessert.

A good place. But the place is not easily accessible from my home, I do not happen to visit here much.

When you cancel an order yourself due to rains or any other issue, its your duty to inform the customer about that. 
We are tension free that our order is placed. When it is delayed and we call you, you give no proper information and simply cut the call. 
Thereafter on chat we come to know that the order was cancelled a while ago. 
Sorry is fine. But what if we have guests at home? 
Please improve the communication.

What do you write about a city favourite food joint?
I'll just tell you mine. Not a big fan of mutton, so those dishes are out. I know, I know. Go ahead and roll your eyes.

The Chicken Biryani (Special) and the Chicken Bharta are hands down the best I've had in the city. Rich, fragrant and undeniably tempting, the serving size is perfect for a meal for two. Soft, succulent pieces of chicken in gravy + biryani rice cooked just right = Happy Me.

Warning: Do not consume on a weekday afternoon, unless you have the rest of the day off. You will be lulled into a happy food coma, especially if you add dessert to the menu. :)

The Biriyani at Shiraz is a treat and probably only second to Arsalan and it also makes the best mutton chanp in town along with the firnis.

The ambience has changed drastically to the pleasant side after the renovation and the reputation exceeds all.

Kebabs or main course Shiraz is one of those places to satisfy your meat cravings at a very affordable price.
A must visit for mughlai cuisine lovers.

Quality and Quantity, are the main entities for a foodie and is rightfully served at Shiraz. Situated at Mallik Bazaar, this restaurant can feel your tummy within 300 bucks.
There are three Shiraz restaurants there. The small one is the main one and takes no taxes.
We had ordered mutton biriyani and trust me, its better than Aminia and Arsalan in both quantity and flavour. Chicken kadai was an absolute yum yum and the tandoori roti was exactly what I had wanted, soft and smooth.

Call me crazy, but I'd visit Shiraz rather than Arsalan. I love their spicy chaaps unlike Arsalan's which in the recent years have turned (according to me) to a sweeter note and definitely way oily. The kebabs are nice though I agree there are places serving better ones but then I would definitely recommend this place if someone inquires.
The biryani has a lower oil content than that of Arsalan, though I agree that Arsalans biryani  has the the upper edge but with a very narrow margin. 
The meal that i prefer, 
A mutton tikia, tandoori roti and chicken biryani and ending with a sweet firni.
Happy dining.

Shiraz is one of the most renowned restaurants in Kolkata that is well known for its exceptional mughlai eatery . Well as a biriyani lover i will keep it after Arsalan and Aminia .
The rice used here in shiraz is slender smooth and unbroken . Both chicken and mutton melts in your mouth . This place has also smartened up the interiors over the years with cushioned chairs and maintained high standards of hygiene and cleanliness 
Try out irani chap murg masallam fish pudina 
Chicken kati kababs mutton rogan josh.
For all people who love Mughlai eateries , this place is a must visit for you :-)

Been there a couple of times. Interior is so so, bright well illuminated but not that classy. According to the seating is just average. Now come to the food quality. Ordered two types of kebab. Shiraz special kebab and malai til kabab both are average. You can't feel the chesse in shiraz special kabab and also the malai in malai til kabab. Now come to the biriyani part. Biriyani was good so as the chicken rezala. But there is lack of option in side dishes. In dessert firni was also average not that great. But there is lack of option as well. Last but not the list staffs are cordial.

I was to travel to Kolkata and I was always hearing two names for biryani - Shiraz and Arsalan. Started off with the mutton biryani in Shiraz. The biryani was good with succulent meat, a potato and decent rice. The style is a bit different from what I'm used to in Hyderabad. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my first biryani in Kolkata and finished the meal with shahi tukda.

People in Kolkata share divided opinion about which is their favourite biriyani place. Arsalan, Shiraz and Aminia are the most favoured top 3. People are quite passionate about one of them much like a Mohunbagan fan is not expected to cheer for East Bengal and vice versa. I personally like Arsalan more but most of my family members prefer Shiraz. Whenever I am in Kolkata our family eatout happens inevitably here. The ambiance is now of a fine dine restaurant unlike a couple of years ago. Food is top notch. Any item you pick is great enough. Service at all 3 of top biriyani restaurants is exemplary. To be honest the quality of Arsalan has gone down in the last couple of years and Shiraz may well be the winner. Highly recommended!

This was my first time in Kolkata, and everyone I know who had visited Kolkata before told me to try Shiraz coz they are supposedly the best in serving food in Park Street, Kolkata and so we did.

Don't expect ambiance of any sort, just tables and chair and food is what you'll get.

We ordered three things here. A Mutton Biryani, a Chicken Biryani and Tandoori Fish.

• Mutton & Chicken Biryani
I won't review them separately as there wasn't much difference between the two. When you hear the word biryani, all the spices and condiments come to your mind but nothing as such was here in Shiraz’s biryani. The spices used were very mild and the biryani looked more like plain colored rice. I know many of you would disagree with me, but I didn't find anything worth trying in it. And who puts a full boiled potato in the biryani? Maybe Shiraz thought of replacing the chicken/mutton piece with the potato as there was only one piece of chicken/mutton in the whole biryani. I mean what the hell? They didn't even serve raita or any curry with it and we ended up eating the biryani dry. Not a good experience indeed.

• Tandoori Fish
The fish experience whereas not as bad as the biryani experience. The fish served with onions and mint chutney was soft and juicy, full of spices and we loved eating it.


Damage Done: 680 bucks.


Overall Rating: 2/5


Even if you don't visit, you're not missing anything.

The name "Shiraz" is surely a word every citizen of Kolkata is well aware of, specially the foodies out there.
And if you are in Park Street and looking for some North Indian delights, you may prefer to choose this outlet for sure to satisfy your cravings.

Nice tasty food, and reasonable pocket pinch is perhaps the USP of the place, and even if you are on a tight budget, you will not regret eating here.
Not much sure about the health conscious segment but surely a place worth mentioning for tasty food at reasonable price.

Order home delivery from this restaurant. The approach of delivery boy is very good and polite as well.delivered within mentioned time.
Food quality and quantity also good.die to health issue,I wrote to add very less spice(in additional comments),in all dish,only that request they didn't follow I guess.

Shiraz was my favourite resturant since childhood.Whenever we used to come to kolkata we used to visit.I really loved their byriani,chaap and firni.I still do but the quality is not like before.They really need to improve the quality of their food.

Shiraz is THE NAME in mughlai cuisine that I knew growing up in Kolkata. I have been to their new restaurant on the opposite side of the site where the old restaurant stood, a couple of times. Though priced higher than the other brands, the quality and quantity are splendid. Ambience is classy and service is very prompt. I would rate it the joint best for biriyani in Kolkata along with my personal favourite Haji saheb of Behala and overall the best in the city.

Located at Park circus mullickbazar crossing, near Institute of Neurosciences

This was the Premier Restaurant for biryani in Kolkata but has lost its shine in the last few years. It still serves a good quality but I was more interested in it 5 years back.

Biryani chaap and laccha paratha are the dishes to try here and one shudnt miss out on these.

Staff is efficient and pocket pinch is okayish.

We ordered  chicken tandoori, it was very tasty. Must try item, I say. We wanted to have something vegetarian, but this restaurant doesn't have many veg items, so we ordered paneer butter masala which was not that great. It was sweet, even though we asked it to make lil spicy. According to waiter's suggestion, we ordered tandoori roti but we personally didn't like it. But I must say it is a good place for hard-core non-vegetarians..

Shiraz make 4 different type of Haleem during the Ramadan months - Mutton / Chicken Arbi Haleem, Hyderabadi Haleem, Irani Haleem & Afghani Haleem. 
All are worth trying but the best in terms taste and texture was Irani. 
I wish they can prepare atleast once a month around the year.

This restaurant needs no introduction.Located at the Mullick Bazar crossing the place has hold on to its reputation for years. We ordered for tandoori roti (₹15/piece) alongside mutton shahi stew (₹180). It was followed by chicken special biriyani (₹265) and mutton biriyani (₹180) with mutton brain masala (₹180) and salad (₹50). Service was prompt and quantity is suffiecient enough to satiate the desire. Coming to quality.... It was brilliance personified. We were 3 and bill value was ₹1049 inclusive of taxes. They are offering 200 ml coke as complementary with every plate of biriyani.

After Arsalan, Shiraz is my next favorite for Biriyani in Kolkata. You cannot be dissatisfied with them no matter what. Shiraz has really delicious and less oily Biriyani. You should also try their chicken tikka and hariyali kebabs and the chicken/mutton chaap as sides to compliment your Biriyani. Their halim preparations are out of the world but unfortunately that dish is only available during Eid. Nevertheless, this joint is a must visit for Biriyani lovers.

P.S- Do go there during the biryani festival (you get 5-6 more biryani to choose from)
The toilet needs to be cleaned more often :3

Shiraz has always been the place for Royal Cuisine. Started my childhood with newpaper reviews on this restaurant and had exactly the same experience when visited the place. 

So, the love for Biryani brings you here. 
White and golden rice, light, fragrant, softest meat, buttery aloo... Yummm!! 
And during the Ramadan... The special Haleem... One bowl.. And you are done.

We ordered the mutton rezala, shahi curry, mutton biriyani, chicken chaap and brain masala curry. While the brain masala was delicious the rezala and shahi curry were nothing great. Not to say that they were badly made but still they weren't really memorable. The mutton biriyani was good and so was the chicken chaap though both were a bit too oily. Too bad we missed the haleem.

This is one of the best places to have biriyani in kolkata. No complaints wih quantity as well as quality. Been here 4 or 5 times and found the staff impolite all the times. Once we college friends had a bill of 1280 (including vat and service charge) and paid 1300, while leaving a staff said to my friend "sirf khana hi sikha". It was one of the most insulting statements. But i think the tasty kebabs and biriyani somehow compensated for it.

Not worth the time or money!  Pathetic!!!!

Usually when I visit Shiraz, I order a  Mutton Biryani, but when you're with a renowned food blogger you got to try something else, so Indrajit Da recommended Keema Matar and I totally loved it. Chunks of minced mutton cooked with green peas in a curry is something to drool for, the next time you're in Shiraz, try this.

I ordered chicken tandori, tandori roti and chicken bhuna and a plate of chicken biriyani.

The tabndori chicken was fresh and the meat was succulent but didn't like the flavours much.

Chicken bhuna was very good! A bit spicy but very well balanced.

The biriyani was awesome.

I was planning for a lunch in some moghlai restaurant with my girl friend and ultimately we finalized this place. Its a prominent and pronounced place located at the crossing of mallickbazar. Seating space is sufficient which includes arrangement in ground floor and 1st floor so unless there's a lot of crowd one need not to wait outside. Ac is centralised and temperature well controlled. Waiters are polite, Service is prompt and almost no waiting thats the best part.
Coming to the main part 'The Food': we ordered a plate of chicken malai til kebab one chicken biriyani and one mutton biriyani. Kebab was soft and flavours coming out well. The biriyani was perfect kolkata biriyani. It was light, flavours were perfect, the aloo and mutton was was well cooked and thus very soft. U get 200ml coke free with a plate of biriyani, this is an offer going on. So it was a perfect lunch. Prices are reasonable compared to the quality and quantity of food. Looking forward to visit this place really soon to try their mutton halim with roomali roti.

Let the record show that this particular Shiraz is the best in Kolkata. It absolutely demolishes any competition from its sister shops elsewhere. In terms of Biryani shops in Kolkata, Shiraz is definitely up there with the best, although it remains to be seen how well they fare over a longer period with stiff competition.

Shiraz's food is without question, brilliant. There can be no argument regarding the pure quality of foodstuff, or the portions they provide. For a premium Biryani joint, they manage to dish out a very large quantity of Biryani at the premium price. They're also pretty well received on the Chaap front -- I personally prefer their mutton over their chicken. The Chicken chaap is pretty standard, and does nothing to thrill. The mutton chaap however packs a larger punch and is basically more edible. But if you're a Chicken fanatic, you're probably going to order Chicken chaap anyway. Side note, they make a damn good Tikkia as well.

I've never sat and eaten at Shiraz, but I've been to the place. Therefore, I cannot quite disclose service stats.

Ambience/Interiors: 3.5/5
Service: n/a
Food: 4/5
Value for Money: 3/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Went to Shiraz yesterday with family for dinner (my second visit after almost 9 years). Thank God we reached almost at thenick of time because in 10 minutes or so, the seats started filling up fast. We ordered for Shiraz Special Chicken Kebab (₹ 275) and Mutton Boti Kebab (₹250) and both were served with green chutney, pickle and slices of onion. The Shiraz Special was supposed to be a chicken kebab with cheese (as per the person who took our order) did neither looked nor tasted so (the Arsalan Special is 100 times better than this) and the Mutton Boti needed some more cooking. Next for the main course, we ordered Chicken Biriyani (₹175), Mutton Biriyani (₹180), Chicken Rezala(₹160) and Mutton Pasinda(₹220). The biriyani quantity was huge with good chunks of meat pieces and an aloo (no egg, though the menu says you can ask for extra egg and aloo). The Chicken Rezala was a tad too sweet for my tastebud and again the Pasinda seemed to be ubderdone, quite chewy and hard. It looked obvious that the mutton dishes needed some more time to be perfected.

Overall the food was just okay and the most annoying thing was there were people standing beside your table waiting for you to leave. The management should look into this and either have a proper waiting place for them or at least not allow them to roam around the tables when people are actually having meals, makes one feel annoyed and irritated too.

What should you stop by for?

A glorious plate of subtle tasting mutton biriyani, a stunningly rich and spicy, chicken chaap, a whole range of mouth watering kebabs and obviously the firni. There are obviously a whole range of other delicious items on offer, but this is more or less the staple order we make, every time we visit.

We deliberately try and sit by the kebab window. Yes, I know I sound a bit desperate here, but the sight and the smell is what kind of helps build the appetite. If you are as an ardent kebab lover like I am, you would agree too.

Shiraz has been there for decades. Went to the old outlet in Park Street-Park Circus Area. Shiraz is famous for their biriyani. The place is small, but the ambiance is good. The waiters are really courteous. Ordered Special Biriyani, and Tandoori Chicken. 
Shiraz has probably the best biriyani in Kolkata (with very low amount of oil). The Tandoori Chicken was also well made. Quantity is good, and the place is VFM. :)
Happy Eating.

The place needs no introduction as Shiraz is well known in the city. This particular outlet is near the Mullickbazar and FreeSchool street crossing. Near the lane towards Mocambo. 

I have been here twice and l have ordered the basic . The special Chicken Biriyani and the Mutton Chanp. The food was good and service was quick. The staff could have been a bit more courteous and friendly. 

The decor was tastefully done and the food was delightful. Loved the experience. The place stays crowded at all hours of the day. Pricing is nice with 2 people having a meal within 600 rupees. 
One good feature of the outlet is that it has a separate take away counter which makes the waiting for takeaway less. 

Would love to visit once again.

Heard from some friends and came here. Not happy with dis place at all. The staff is nt helpful at all. We ordered for a spicy gravy item and they suggested , which was not at all spicy and no taste at all. again we ordered for mutton biryani, which was really not upto the expectation. There was only dry rice in the biryani and one small piece of mutton.

Maybe one of the renowned places un Kolkata... But the ambience is bad... Feels unclean... Chaotic... It stinks just as you step out of the restaurant... Finally when its about food, it is average...

Been here many many years back. If I remember correctly it was in the year 1999, when me and my friend had dropped in after having a quiz competition at St. Xavier's College. It was a time when Shiraz was indeed famous for their Biryanis. The quantity was huge, the mutton portion was succulent and there was this large and soft boiled potato. The outlet was huge as well, probably not airconditioned by then. The staffs were courteous and the driver uncle who came with my friend helped us have a cozy time in the restaurant.

Now that's a really amazing place which is famous for its biryani. I had to say that I wasn't disappointed. They serve really nice biryani here and apart from that the general food is also very good. I ordered the khamiri roti and chicken gravy with some tikka to follow. The restaurants serves real good food and the quality is also good. All this comes for a reasonable amount. Perfect place to fill your belly.

Well to start i must say the guard in front of the new restaurant is very good . He was extremely courteous and helpful ! He helped us get seats really fast . Then coming to the interiors , its white and blue lights and good , nothing special ! Biriyani is such a wholesome food that it requires nothing else so lets come directly to food ! 
We entered early and were served very fast . We had everything from Biriyani to Butter Naans , Mutton Keema Curry to Chicken Kadai , Tandoori to Chicken Dopiaza . It was all well cooked and flavoursome ! We liked the rice because it wasn't very spicy and tasty . So this is a classic restaurant with classic dishes . Enjoy the good food !

Excellent biryani. EXCELLENT. I am not very fond of mutton but this place has the best cooked mutton ever, which is gradually changing my perspective towards it. We ordered a lot since celebrations cannot go without eating. Mutton biryani, mutton chaap with just the right amount of spices (I don't know how they do it!), qeema mattar went perfectly well with the masala kulcha. The chicken rezalla fails in comparison to the mutton dishes. They do have an excellent starter range, the tangri kebab is the best thing ever, tender and succulent. Best place to go with your family as the ambience is nice and the prices are worth the quality they offer.

My first time to this popular restaurant.. location is great on mullickbazar crossing.. and the interiors were really decent comparing to the nearby arsalans and zeeshan. Took a MUTTON BIRYANI ,CHICKEN KADAI and FIRNI for two. The food came in no time.The biryani with sizeable portion of meat and potato and was really a nice one . The gravy of chicken kadai was brilliant but the chicken peices could have been softer. Phirni was nice , but i hav had better.

Indeed a legendary restaurant. This is the place where I had biryani for the first time in my life. So this place has a special place in my heart. The mutton biryani is of course their speciality. Their mutton chap is equally good and goes well with lacchha parathas. Their mutton rezala is also quite good. Among the kebabs you can try their tikka, reshmi and haryali kebab. The ambience is pretty decent and the prices are affordable.

This restaurant has been catering to the Calcuttan’s rising demand of “Mughlai Biryani” since years now with pride and élan..... Located at the Mullick Bazar Crossing,,, Shiraj—Golden Restaurant may seem like a congested nd local eatery,,,, but one spoonful of their Biryani,,,, nd you shall be craving for more.......
This restaurant,,,, too,,, has numerous branches but i specifically recommend this branch because it’s the best and oldest.....

Over ten years My family and I have been visiting here almost every month once or twice. Having your parents as biryani lovers it is quite obvious and this is one of the greatest places in the city which serves extremely mouth-watering biryani.

Food:For starters Tandoori chicken and Reshmi kebab are my personal favourites. Mutton biryani with either chicken Chaap or Rezala or Dopiyaza makes the perfect main course. My brother prefers roti, so we have even tried out tandoori roti, Naan (with they will serve with extra butter if asked for) and kulcha. They make excellent chicken Kadai and Bharta. Finally, these delicacies are to be complimented with Firni(seasonal mango flavor ones) or Gajar ka Halwa.

Service: The staffs are extremely gentle and co-operative. Sometimes you have to wait very long to get tables on the first floor, and during special occasions and festive seasons, it is impossible to get a reservation at all which actually popularity the popularity of this place. No doubt, a traditional and legendary place like Shiraz is a must visit for every Calcuttan and all Tourists on their visit to Kolkata.

Intro - I remember during childhood and even during college and early career days, Shiraz used to "The Biriyani Eatery" for me and family. Revisited - in fact after a long time - first time after it crossed the road to the other side .

Decent ambience - enter and you deep dive in the aroma of Biriyani and chanp ! 

We took takeaway

Food : Chicken Biriyani,Mutton Biriyani

Chicken Biriyani - Superb, fantastic fantafabulous- I am sure a hattrick of adjectives says it all ! So tasty , so beautifully prepared , the aroma - perfect , no stickiness due to excessive oil - infact it never felt oily , yet the rice was soft , long grains , the potato tasted very nice , the chicken piece was soft  tender, juicy - Overall just perfect 4.5/5

Mutton Biriyani - Similar feedback from family 4.5/5

Service - Fast takeaway TAT (Turn Around Time )

Overall - I just loved it 4.5/5

There is absolutely nothing to hate about Shiraz. Situated at a rather convenient location, after visiting this restaurant only twice I have absolutely fallen in love with it. I thought that nothing could top Arsalan but I was sadly mistaken, Shiraz is a million times better. We ate a hearty three course meal- consisting of mutton Biryani, salad, bharta, naan, tandoori roti and firni and it was well within Rs600.

Ps. The staff members are very attentive and always willing to assist.

Being one of the oldest names in the Kolkata moghlai food genre,this place needs no iintroduction . The vintage seating arrangements, age old staffs & menu,makes me feel great & i eventually end up ordering large number of dishes. 
We ordered for fish tandoori, mutton bara kebab as starters. This was followed by mutton pasinda,mutton chap,their special mutton biriyani & lacha paratha. The sweet dishes constituted firni and sahi tukra.
The taste,quality and quantity of all the above mentioned items were magnificent . The special mention for me would be the mutton bara kabab and sahi tukra. I would love to give credit and accolades to this place for standing the taste of time in competition with the new start ups and concept cuisines.

Shiraz in Kolkata is a legend for biryanis. A whole generation of Calcuttans (much before it was “Kolkata”) grew up to its tastes. So much so, Calcuttans who have migrated often become nostalgic, to the extent of becoming emotional, over Shiraz biryani. The Calcuttan between us keeps looking for this style biryani in NCR. Insatiated, we recently visited Shiraz to see how did it fare with changing times.

Biryani is a cult. Aficionados do not mind travelling cities to have the perfect biryani. This complete dish mostly comprising rice – meat – rose water – spices has evolved in various styles all over India.

Kolkata style Biryani is distinct from other varieties of biryanis. This style has emanated from the Awadhi style brought to Kolkata by Wajed Ali Shah during his exile. The biryani is subtly flavored with saffron, rose water and other fragrant spices. Plus it always comes with a huge boiled potato and is sometimes garnished with a boiled egg. It is far less spicy / strong in taste than the North or South Indian Biryanis.

Shiraz is synonymous to Biryani for any Calcuttan. It had humble beginnings God knows when. However, about twenty years ago, it used to be a spartan eatery at the prominent Park Street – Mullick Bazar Crossing. People would not mind sharing tables with complete strangers, such was the leveling experience.

On a recent visit, we saw things have changed. This is now a fully air-conditioned restaurant with multi level seating and an annexe in an adjacent building. We ordered chicken biriyani, rezala, raita and firni.

Thankfully, the taste was intact over the years. The rice melted in the mouth while the flavours took over our senses. The mutton / chicken pieces were tender and could be easily separated with a fork (although fans would swear that fingers are the best option). The rezala was mild and helped in moistening the biryani.

The rice pudding - firni set in earthen pots was also mildly flavoured and sweetened. In fact, subtlety seemed to be their trademark, every dish was mild. This allowed diners to eat more without feeling uncomfortable.

We were told that Shiraz was not what it used to be. However, this experience belied all our apprehensions. Even if we are in Kolkata for half a day, we will surely try to have a meal at Shiraz.

One plate of juicy and succulent mutton Biryani is enough for a ravenous foodie. Their chaap is to die for. Their Biryani festival is something to watch out for.  Have tried almost all the variants. Loved them all. Ambience is a bit let down but. Overall, a good place. Must try. :)

Have been there several times both for dine in and take away. Their Biryani is just awesome. No introduction is required for Biryani of shiraj.
The ambience is quite good. Staffs are well behaved and courteous.
I tried their : Chicken and Mutton Biryani. Both are excellent in taste. Fish Tandoori is a must try dish. It's really tasty. Chicken Rezala and Phirni are also good.
Maximum time I went there to take away Biryani.

Shiraz is not just an eatery... It is an institution.... I have been going there since I was little.... When it was located on the opposite footpath with an open terrace.... The Biryani they make is Kolkata classic.... With aloo and dim.... And succulent piece of Mutton and lovely rice.... They make a mean reshmi kebab Masala.... Which is a favourite.... It is one of those places where you can go and rest assured the food served will be to your liking... The kebabs and tabdoori chicken are to die for... It is my brother's favourite... But nothing tips the Biryani..... The very thought of it makes my mouth water... Even in this intolerable heat!!!

Okay first things first.
The biryani failed my expectation. It lacked the bit  spiciness that one would find in other biryani outlets in and around the city.It had the quality but lacked the taste.
Other side dishes were nothing extraordinary,including the raita(nothing extraordinary much can you expect from a raita though)
And to conclude with,my Firni had a piece of hair in it (they changed it though).I ain't a firni expert but it seemed to have rose water out of proportion. You wouldn't get those kaju/pesta bites in your firni.
A full marka to them on hospitality and ambience.
P.s-not the kind of place if you are planning a dinner date there.
Thank you.

The place is a little congested and is situated in one of the busiest places of Kolkata, but the biriyani they serve is quite good. Yes, like all Kolkata biriyanis, they have potato minus the egg. That might be turn off for some. Price is reasonable and the service is extremely quick. Its the perfect place to go when I want to sneak out of my office and dig into biriyani on an otherwise busy day :P

I have tried out their shaadi biriyani and I found it to be different and good :) the firni and shahi tukda was also nice . The place also serves delicious haleem during the Ramzan days in the evening.

Probably one of the most famous places in Kolkata for Biryani, Shiraz Golden did not disappoint at all. We had the chicken Biryani and the Chicken Biryani Special. Both were really really good! I did not find much difference though between the two except for the price difference (considerable amount of difference, if I may add). But that is purely because I have limited knowledge about Biryanis, I am sure some expert might be able to tell the difference, but for me they were more or less the same. Nonetheless, it tasted fabulous and that's what matters! Arguably the best Biryani I have ever had! Definitely would love to visit again soon. Oh and the decor is quite pleasant too. Not too lavish but pleasing nonetheless.

I have people in my family who would not eat biryani from anywhere but shiraz!
This place has a nostalgic value for me...my love for biryani started from here!
over recent years shiraz has developed and my favorites here are:
mutton biyani_still the best in town.
chciken rezala-chicken in a curd base gravy,pretty light.
chciekn amristari kebab-good,juicy and yummy,they could work on the quantiy though.
mutton egg roll- decent but too heavy!
i always end y meal with nice and creamy firni :)

An amazing place to stop by for lunch and dinner,  in a city hustling and bustling with energy under the heat of the sun. Air conditioned interiors are absolutely welcoming. Thanks to my friend shwetlana for introducing me to this joint. We had a chicken biryani,  a chicken rezala and a plate of Shahi Tukda,  which gave us a bill of rs. 750*approx,  all inclusive. All were absolutely splendid and tasted fresh. However,  there's certainly much scope in taste improvement,  for I've had better biryanis. The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. Luckily we didn't have to wait and were quickly ushered to out seats. Though there were some people waiting while we came out.  A must go place,  for atleast once,  that does live much upto the hype around its name and it's even easy on the pocket!

Okay,  the food was pretty nice. I had a Mutton rezala with tandoori roti, one tangri kebab and one special Mutton biriyani. Tandoori roti was real fluffy and nice, the Mutton rezala did taste great but it was pretty oily, like you could see the layer of oil floating. The tangri kebab was pretty soft and yum and the biriyani was nice. Hospitality was average. Overall, a decent place to dine with family with lighter pocket.

One of the few places in Kolkata where I return once in a while for a fix of comfort food. The ambience has changed over the years, and have to say it looks much better than earlier. However, if you went there, you'd be wondering how weird it looked earlier :)

On my last visit, ordered for regular stuff. Mutton Rezala - nice creamy slow cooked mutton, swimming in fat. Problem with ordering this is, the staff will ask you why you are ordering this on its own and not with biryani .. it's my order ffs. Anyway, other stuff ordered were fried liver and mutton kebabs. The liver has been one of my favourites here over the years, and you can just have it melt in your mouth when you use a rumaali roti to wrap around it. Delicious. The kebabs are great too. Finished with a serving of their lovely firni, which isn't too sweet like many other places.

While the place is also known for its biryanis, I'd suggest against it - unless you are a fan of BIG servings of rice. For some reason, the rice is enough to feed 4 people and meat for 1 person. YMMV, and if you like biryanis, can check it out. Would also recommend a time other than evenings when it is less crowded. A late breakfast here on the weekends will be a good experience.

Yum Biriyani and yummier chicken dishes!! Don't forget the phirni which is simply out of world!! The price maybe a bit overrated but the food balances it! :)

A bit overhyped.
I have experienced better Mughlai delicacies at a price half of it.
Biryani is good, side dishes are not up to the mark.
Staffs are way too unprofessional.

This outlet of the popular restaurant chain is located diagonally opposite south park Street cemetery, and opposite the park Street rahmania outlet . The name is prominently visible , and the décor inside is pretty nice . The restaurant has an air conditioned segment right after the entrance , with mostly tables for 4 or 6 . The Biryani here needs no introduction. The mutton biryani has a single piece of potato with a perfectly cooked piece of meat , and flavoured rice that is slightly on the oilier side , though not entirely the greasy type that is common in Biryanis. The chicken reshmi butter masala tasted awesome ; the gravy was light , thick , white , with 6 perfectly cooked pieces of boneless chicken , that melt in your mouth ! The firni here tastes good , served in the usual handi and is a always a must ending to your plate of biryani . The service was quick and the staff were very courteous , keeping track of the tables and ready to serve the next item as soon as your plate is empty . Overall , this happens to be the best outlet of Shiraz in Kolkata and probably the oldest too. So , don't miss it !

The restaurant is located in park circus near 7 point crossing. I go there all the time. This is a pretty standard restaurant which serves one of the best biriyanis in kolkata. The ambience of the place is pretty nice and the decor is pretty cool. The biriyani and chicken kebabs of this are pretty delicious. Prices are standard. A proper family restaurant.

Since this one is very close to my place I have frequented this one a multitude of times.We regularly take mutton biryani( which is one of the best that you'll ever have,though sometimes I find it slightly oily.), tandoori roti and chicken chap..This is one of those Calcutta Classics and you would want to visit this one at least once if you haven't already.

Went their on a friend's birthday treat... The place is good..and gives a feel of old calcutta even though they have renovated the entire restaurant... Coming to the food we had ordered chicken tikka butter masala,kadai chicken, paneer butter masala, rumali rotis and chicken biriyani... Chicken tikka butter masala was good but i have had better than this..kadai chicken was very average...the worst was paneer butter masala... Biriyani was good but not great....service wasn't good either..they kept knocking us as if to remind that we were occupying the table for too long.. Which i didn't like... Overall an average experience...

Shiraz's Biriyani quality has detoriated like anything. Price has gone above the roof. They don't really care for customer satisfaction. Shiraz is just running by its name. Once I took some kebab & biriyani, the biriyani taste was ridiculous, the kebab was a joke. Our office used to order biriyani from Shiraz on various occassions but recently we have stopped completely

Had gone there once with friends...we took a seat in the upstairs ac section. The atmosphere has a typical charm, I guess Shiraz's heritage forms a part of it.
I loved the mutton chap,which I had with a couple of soft tandoori roti.
However,what I really loved was the firni...rich,creamy and cold. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone.

What we ordered: Chicken tangri kabab, chicken reshmi kabab, mutton biriyani, mutton lababdar, mutton pasinda and chicken reshmi butter masala.

What we didn't like: chicken reshmi butter masala was a bit too bland, mutton lababdar was a bit too dry.

What we loved: the tangri kebab was very juicy, pasinda was great too, the biriyani.

Verdict: for the service I'd gladly give 4/5. The biriyani is great and hence there is no reason not to visit the place again. But it won't be high in my list.

There's nothing much I need to talk about this place...the name itself says it all...its just not a brand, they've maintained their quality as well... Well, I am not a fan of their biriyani though...apart from that their gravy items are top notch...its the best in the town I feel...**try out their shahi mutton stew and paratha**...tell me if u don't like....its heavenly...
If u like brain...then try their mutton brain masala, its yumm...they don't disappoint in the kebab section too....well, I really don't have anything to complain about the place.... They have got 2 shiraz hotel on the same footpath..one is an old one and the other one is new...go to the old one if u wanna save on taxes...its non A/C, though they've got A/C section too... And the new one is completly airconditioned...I feel the parathas and tandoori roti's are always fresh in the new one...
If u are low on budget try their mutton tikia and roti...too good... ;)

I went to Shiraz after a long time and I had my favourite Chicken Biryani with Mutton Chanp and I really liked the food. But I think their original taste of Biryani was missing though it was not bad. I personally felt that something was missing. And the chicken Chaanp was also good bit it should have less oily. And he firni was very good. Would like to eat over there again if I happen to pass that place. And I really wish that they brim back their old taste in Biryani and by the way the aroma was fantastic. Their service was also excellent. Ambience was also good. Overall a good experience.

First we ordered chicken tengri kebab and shiraz special kabab. Firstly the presentation was horrible. They put the kebabs, salad, red colored sweet veggie sauce and green chatni all in a single plate. It was very inconvenient for us to eat out of it. I didn't like the sweet sauce but had to eat it anyway because it was all mixed up. However the meat was cooked perfectly. Next was mutton biryani. The meat again was perfectly cooked however the biryani itself tasted bland. The seasonings were not right at all. The characteristic smell of biryani was also missing. It was a disappointment to be honest. One would expect a lot from such restaurant when Arsalan is just round the corner. Price wise. I felt it was a bit more than what we were served.

Shiraz the golden restaurant..the name says it all. Had lunch with my family on a sunday afternoon..it was very easy to locate at mallick bazar more. We were able to find seats instantly. Now coming to the food the mutton biriyani is a must try here. We also ordered shiraz special kebab which was equally tasty. The chicken pieces were really tender and moist. The mutton in the biriyani was just lip smacking. We ordered  sahi tukra and gajar ka halwa for dessert. The sahi tukra was delicious with the grated khoya kheer on the top..the gajar ka halwa was there winter speciality..it was really good..the food was top notch..the only issue was that the staff could be a little more friendly.

The dish Biryani is synonymous with Shiraz Golden Restaurant . To satiate our Biryani cravings, we went Park Street on a busy college day. And we were not disappointed. The staffs welcomed us and showed our seats courteously. The ambience was nice with dim lights and comfortable seatings. We ordered 2 platters of Special Mutton Biryani and One plate of Special Kaachi Biryani, these were accompanied with Murgh Irani. The service was very fast and prompt which you long the most when you are famished. The taste of the Biryanis was lip-smacking especially the Kaachi Biryani. They were not too oily, the muttons were soft and artfully cooked. The Murgh Irani made the perfect camaraderie with the biryanis. At last, we took their winter special dessert item Gajar-ka-Halwa, which was just perfect and really smoothing to the taste buds. And of course the most important, the pocket pinch was mere 900 bucks.
But one con was they didn't accept credit card, so we had to pay the entire amount in cash. So if the bill was more, we had to spend some sweat. But nevertheless, it was a gastronomical delight and I will recommend this outlet to every foodie out there. Cheers and keep eating!!!

Shiraz has been my favorite biryani joint (read only) since I was in primary school. Yes I've been favoring their awesome biryani since then and I have not been disappointed even for once. But, very recently I have noticed a downward slide in their quality. My heart aches and I wish to overlook stuff but after a point I can't. Please please take note and buck up coz I don't want my favorite restaurant to lose to cut throat competition in the biryani scene now.

Shiraz is basically a specialist in whatever they make as they are into the business for some years and they have doing what they love to do the best in terms of foods like biryani , different side dish curries , different breads or naan all are just made very portioned filled and tasteful too .
I never miss a point to have awesome food over here if I am around and craving for biryani ,now however prices are very much gone up but they still maintain the quality which is the USP of this place .
And whenever after eating to end my meal i end it wiylthbsome nice firni which is also very delicious and fresh available here .

We ended up at Shiraz for grabbing a quick lunch on a Sunday afternoon. To our utter relief, one table was available and we were promptly seated. We ordered the all time favourites - Mutton Seekh Kabab and Chicken Biryani. Unlike many I know, I love the taste of biryani without any accompanying gravy. To me, that's how the rich but light taste and aroma of biryani can be enjoyed the most without any adulteration. Ambiance is just functional, and of course, hardly a concern in these old biryani joints in town. The Seekh Kabab was tasty, though a bit on the crumbly side. And the biryani was the legendary Shiraz variety, with a juicy chicken piece and a succulent potato thrown in. It was a good lunch, and the prices are pretty moderate considering the quality served.

After a whole hearted recommendation by my friend I went here for lunch during my visit to kolkata. Known for its authentic biryani and non veg I really liked it but the hype was still not completely met.

It is a considerably big outlet in backyard of busy park street with good number of seating and basic dining environment. Decor is not much of a thing here as they mostly stress on food and service rather than a pleasing ambiance. Staff is good and always open to discussion regarding your taste preference for order. Service is real quick which shows how they have kept the ingredients mostly prepared.

As advised by them I ordered their Mutton Biryani and Mutton Stew with roti and ended my meal with phirni (kheer). Biryani was clearly authentic i.e plain with light flavors of rice with tender mutton and boiled potato. You can't expect much of a spice in a Kolkata biryani but the overall taste was still pleasing. Stew was average with ultra soft mutton but infused in a not so impressive gravy. Phirni again can be placed just near an average rating sweet dish. 

In all the place has got good side when it is judged on the basis of authenticity but still there is a lot of scope of healthy improvement considering preparations and flavors.

My Rating: 
1. Food: 3.5/5
2. Ambiance: 3.25/5
3. Service: 3.75/5
4. Value of Money: 3.25/5

There was a time when Shiraz was synonymous with Biryani especially for the locals close by. It still remains so for a lot of people but not for me as a person. I would rather rate Arsalan and Zam Zam over it. The rest of the dishes are okay BUT the charm of the Biryani it used to serve has faded away. However, if you still want to try out the reputed Shiraz Biryani, it is not a complete let down. The service is decent but the lack of interest shown by the staff catering to the customers is a big turn-off.

Visited this place a lot. I love the mutton biryani especially the aloo that has a heavenly tatste. This time i tried out the shiraz special chicken kebab. This dish was divine as expected. The saucy aloo chat that they provided with the dish just enhanced its flavour. The kebabs was so smooth and soft that it melted and soon was over. 😞 Guys this dish is a must-try. I also tried out chicken do piyasa witg tandoori roti. It was the perfect combination.

It must have been 20 years, that I am visiting Shiraz at Mullick Bazar. It was at the other side of the road few year's back, with a non AC ground floor and AC first floor. Then it shifted to the other side of the road, and re-branded as Shiraz Golden. There are two outlets now with a gap of 50 meters between them. 

Shiraz and Biryani became synonymous to me during late 90's and early 2K. I can still remember the last time I visited there in 2002 before moving to Bengaluru with a new job. After 1.5 years, when I came back to my home town again, the first thing that struck me - I can again have Biryani from Shiraz, 

Coming straight to the food. Biryani to me, is mutton Biryani. With Chicken, you can have a good and similar dish, but the I cannot reach  the wholesome feeling with a Chicken dish.  The quality of mutton and the cuts matter here. I accept, there are times, when I find the meat with a bit lower quality. But most of the time, Shiraz does full justice to their reputation. The rice is really long grain, and fluffy. The perfect balanced aroma is the winning factor for Shiraz, along with the perfect salt balance. Those, who cooks Biryani at home, can understand what I am talking about. It is very tough to reach that balance. Like a good whisky, you must taste this with Nose and Palate. The aroma should reveal a strong saffron note over a steady cinnamon base. Basically the base is created with a heavy dose of Garam Masala and Ghee. The meaty-fatty flavor gives a strong savory character to the aroma, which is balanced with a mild note of Kewda and rose water. Amazing balance. The texture has it's own character for Shiraz. Unlike the strong orange/saffron , it is much lighter is colour. The oil is nicely balanced, not dry, not too oily.  Apart from Biryani, if you ask for two more dishes which are my favorite, are Mutton Pasinda and Firni. Just amazing.    

Now coming to another part of Shiraz, which mostly unknown. It is their breakfast. Go to Shiraz around 6:30-7:00 in the morning, and try Daal-Gosht, Roti and Paya. It's another experience by itself. Before you come out after the breakfast, just don't miss the tea. Again you will be amazed.

We visited the legendary mughlai restro for our lunch on a sunny winter afternoon..the place has evolved itself over the years in size and grandeur but the quality of their food does have a masterful touch to it..mutton biryani is simply one of the best if not the best variety of kolkata biryani..not a hint of excess oilyness to it and the mutton pieces r tender and succulent..mutton stew and roganjosh were also prepared to perfection..the bill came out reasonably cheap compared to the quality of food offered here..perhaps this is the reason why people throng to this place since time immemorial..overall value for money!

went there for 2 times... both the times the place was absolutely conjested. have to wait outside for 30-40mins. Total management system was rubish as there is no system at all. although biriyani is so so.. chaap is good.. mutton kasha is bad... amd gajar ka halwa is good. enough of shiraj... big name.. no quality or system... friends haji ali serves better biriyani than shiraj. arsalan is much much much better anyday.

Went there on Christmas. It was crowded and we had to wait for 10 minutes due to the line.
This is one of my favourite biriyani restaurants in Kolkata. I love this restaurant. The ambience is good & the serving is also quite fast. 
We ordered Chicken tikka kabab at first. It was delicious. Then we ordered Tandoori roti and Mutton Pasinda. It tasted superb. And at last the biriyani. *__* 
The best Christmas :)

If you want to have a mouth watering mutton biriyani and decide to visit Shiraz ...then go to park street outlet of Shiraz... this is the best among seven outlets... 
We visited just before Christmas week and ordered Resmi kebab , Mutton buriyani , Chicken biriyani & Firni... the food and ambience overall is good...

My aunt "surprised" me with this plastic box packed with Shiraz's heavenly Mutton Biryani Special tonight. One spoonful and I was right there in the Biryani heaven! The two huge "chunks" of mutton were perfectly cooked-soft,,juicy and spicy. The potatoes were fragrant with spice,perfectly complimenting the Mutton Biryani.The amount was enough to fill up two people but as usual I finished it because I am a Biryani Devourer (I couldn't move after that but then that's a completely different story).
P.S- I wouldn't think one would mind paying just Rs.275 for getting to be in food heaven for some time!

A busy afternoon,3 pm on clock.. i entered in this restora quite by chance. (There was a rally in esplanade so my bus took a longcut through entaly). The inside ambience was much decorative. Fully air conditioned. And when i settled down at table,a suited manager(probably) came to take order.
My first call was Nargisi kofta and rumali roti.. Manager: nargisi kofta is not available.
I: ok,then kashmiri chicken and...
Manager: kashmiri chicken isn't available.

I gave up hope.

Manager: sir,why dont u try Irani Chaap?today's special item.
I: ok,bring it in.
After almost 20 min.. irani chaap and rumali roti hit my table.
In plate,there was a handsome mutton piece,one mutton tikia and sliced carrot all over😠
On first touch,my tongue didn't response too much. After finishing the last piece it responded the same.the flavour was good,the taste was avarage.
So,according to my experience,3 is enough for you Shiraz.

We visited Shiraz Golden Restaurant in the first week of December, 15. We tried their special biriyiani, chicken reshmi kabab, mutton boti kabab and firni. The quality of biriyani was too good as expected. But being a kabab lover, I can say don't go for boti kabab its not that good but their firni is a must try thing.

We had chicken biryani special and reshami kabab. The kabab was good but the biryani was less on spice and the chicken quantity was also less. Also they dont serve raita along with biryani which is again a surprise! Overall, just about average experience

I have been a regular at this place for the last 30 years. Not just me but also my entire family has been regularly visiting this restro and I have just continued the tradition. My parents often talk to me about the days when a plate of Chicken Chaap and rotis, sufficient for one person, would cost around Rs.5 (yes....you read it right...Rs.5).
Truly speaking Shiraz needs no introduction to foodies and frankly my review is just a tribute to the taste that they offer.
Originally this outlet was located on the opposite side of Park Street i.e. where presently GT Route is located. Today they have relocated to the opposite side with two centres side by side.The bigger one has a contemporary look while the smaller one has stuck to the traditional looks.Many of the old staff can still be seen today, serving customers . The cutlery is the same as of yesteryears.
In a nutshell the appearance of this age old restaurant has changed but the soul remains the same.

This place was the only outlet available back then. Increasing competition has seen many other outlets open in Kolkata but this one remains my favourite (Read: Nostalgia).
I consider the Mutton Pasinda and Mutton Chaap as their best items...with Mutton Biriyani a very very close second.Their Chicken items are also pretty good.
How can I forget their Mutton Rezala....oops I forgot the Shahi Stew....hey wait ...I just forgot to mention Iranian Chaap.
Actually the list goes on. You have to visit this place quite a number of times to savour their dishes.
For those with a sweet tooth:Do not forget to enjoy the Firni.
Restaurants may come and Restaurants may go.....but (for me) Shiraz will go on forever (Knock wood..😇).
P.S. Try out a Chai pe Charcha with friends some evening.....the Tea is worth every buck you pay.

Had taken away their chicken biriyani. It was packed very well.
Quality wise the biriyani was good although they had mixed type of rice that means the big sized rice was mixed up with small ones. Still it tasted very good.
But the main problem was with the quantity. One pack was not even enough for a single person. And also the size of the chicken piece was also very small...

The biryani is full of flavour and light! Keep it simple with Tandoori chicken as starter and tikka masala as a side dish(if u want)!!!! but just dont miss the firni!
however i have complains about their nun roti which get charred to the point that it stinks of chacoal! Their rolls are overpriced!!
So to sum up it's a good place for biryani and ...well..... that's all about it!

The best biriyani in Kolkata is probably available at Shiraz. The chicken bharta is also better than any other restaurant. Now the ambience has also become very good! The only thing that's not good is that the food quality is not the same when you take parcels. If you eat at the restaurant, you'll treat yourself to the best North Indian food available in the city!

Chicken reshmi kabab was well prepared ,taste was perfect,soft tender juicy.
But the biryani was plain dead no taste at all, no masala wat so ever ,we thought we were having plain boiled basmati yellow rice with a glance of oil in it.
1 more thing I would like to add onn is that chicken piece in biryani seems as if the chicken has got polio I mean it was flesh less.... 
It had literally spoiled our mood that day.
Just because of chicken reshmi kabab i m giving it 3 or else should have been 1.

This saptami we bought food from shiraz almost after@ 8 years. I was so excited but the food left me disappointed.  quality has detoriated. Taste is nothing special. In parcel we weren't given good pieces of meat. We ordered chicken and mutton biryani.  Both were insufficient in quantity. Though the name is same but my childhood shiraz doesn't exist anymore

I never have seat in this joint but took the take away lot many times as that is convenient from the perspective of my stay at a far away from this place. I love biriyanis and try the same dish at various joints. But the contemporary Aminia, Shiraz, Arsalaan, Nijam are close competitors. But among them, Shiraz is undoubtedly my favorite although Arsalan is also my favorite as I personally feel that the blend of the two biriyanis are different so based on the mood, you can choose one over the other.

Shiraz is one place where the tenderness of the rice and mutton are compatible, the softness of the rice and the not too sharp flavour makes it a well palette which can be very well complemented by their simple firni. The soft smell of the ghee and not too oily yet not too dryness always tempts me go for it.

Went there for a family dinner. They serve a variety of non veg dishes. The names are enough to make you mouthwatering. The chicken Bharta and Shiraz special mutton is a must try. They were delicious with Paratha. The mutton biryani was below average. The chicken tandoori was OK but the content was very little. We ordered a full chicken tandoori what came was like a baby chicken tandoori as compared to the price. The firni was great. The service there is very fast which is a plus point.

Shiraz. The reason Shiraz doesn't have a 4.0+ rating is because people go there with other Biryani in mind. Do. Not. Do. That.

Biryani: Since it is one of the legendary Biryani houses of the city, the Biryani is bound to be good. It is light and melts in your mouth. The golden brown rice here gives off an enticing smell, and you instantly notice it, which only increases your hunger. What a plate of Biryani begs for is a plate of gravy mutton. Screams for it, rather, and yes. They cook the mutton beautifully. The potatoes are cooked evenly and somewhat crisp to the fork or spoon. Beautiful. 

What saddened me though is the thin piece of meat I got. And I wasn't the only unfortunate there, all of my friends agreed that they didn't give generous portions of meat. Hence, the begging side tray of mutton. 

Would I go again? Maybe. Maybe not.

Not the best ambience - noisy and often crowded. Service is mediocre. Sometimes they will run out of kababs and desserts a little too early. Experiences tend to fluctuate depending on when you visit, which is a disappointment. 

BUT - biryani. Oh My God (read in Janice's voice). One of the best in India, easily competes with the likes of Lucknow and Hyderabad. Especially, if you are not into the spicy biryani of Hyd and love to see a huge potato hiding among your flavored rice (like all Bengalis do). This single item alone salvages the reputation of this place.

Best advice - pack a couple of boxes of their biryani, bring it home, close your eyes and enjoy.

If you are from Calcutta, it is least possible that you haven't heard of this name - Shiraz. A brand on it's own terms, this restaurant is one name the Calcuttans swear by. The list is incomplete if you are talking about Calcutta-style biryani leaving out this name. I have been visiting this place since my school days since my school was nearby and it used to be my favourite restaurant at one point. So, during my recent trip to Kolkata I thought of revisiting some of those old tastes and memories. As decided, we were there on a weekday for dinner. It has been revamped and renovated a bit. The seats are more comfortable and the ambience is much better now with brighter lights. We targeted a corner table and took our seats. Instantly, a table attendant came to us for orders. We wanted to order chicken gilafi kebab and mutton seekh kebab but were informed that none were available. Infact most of the mutton kebabs and some of the chicken kebabs weren't available. Found it pretty surprising. Nevertheless, we settled for chicken bara kebab as starter, 1 chicken special biryani, 1 mutton biryani and 1 chicken chaap. The service was pretty good and prompt. The kebab was alright. The biggest disappointment was the biryani. The rice was dry and not at all moist. The chicken pieces were a bit hard and tasted like rubber. The mutton piece seemed like a joke  - a not a very meaty piece and was hard. The potato piece (probably the most desirable item in a Calcutta-style biryani) was well-cooked but tasted too bland and on the sweeter side. The chicken chaap was okay and tasted good. I was pretty surprised by the quality of food that was served to us  - definitely not the type I used to gorge on during my school days and absolutely not the type that was my favourite! The quality of food did not do justice at all to it's price. My impression of my once-favourite Shiraz has changed a lot after this visit. It is over-priced and over-hyped now. There are a lot of new restaurants in the city nowadays that are serving real good biryani, Shiraz will really need to pull up their socks to be able to compete with them. I am still very fond of this restaurant but sadly I can't recommend this to anyone now. True that it is a legendary restaurant but I really hope that it does justice to it's reputation/brand name. Good luck!

Been here a month ago at the time of Eid. It was rather disappointing experience. Ordered the Murg Musallam the delivery time was ok though but I and my friends were highly disappointed with the taste of the dish hi ever the butter nun was good.  I wish they deliver the food much faster. We ordered the food before by informing them as Murg Musallam takes time to prepare but when we reach there they said they haven't received any order. So we have to wait almost 45 mins. All that was good was the environment.

It was almost 11 years back when I 1st visited this restro and at that time it was situated just by the side of rahamaniya...it was a non Ac basic restro then and then it became my Sunday lunch destination during my pre jee days...then it crossed the road and became an Ac restro with a modern interior...so much of nostalgia...bunk it let's come to the point...
Ambience: average
Reception: average
Food: its Shiraz after all and its hard to beat Shiraz in case of mughlai cuisine
Price: average
Highly recommended..

Around 6 years back, had an opportunity to taste the fabled Shiraz biryani and chicken chaanp. What a memorable experience that had been!

Fast forward to 2015 - Got the opportunity to visit Kolkata on a business trip. Headed to Shiraz with my tastebuds tingling in anticipation not knowing how disappointing the evening was going to turn out for me.

One morsel down the mutton biryani, I knew something was not right. Another bite confirmed my worst fears - the biryani was stale and the meat had definitely gone bad. Got a half hearted apology from the manager on pointing this out. Overall a really disappointing experience.

I knew that Shiraz definitely does not score big on ambience before I walked in there. However, being served stale meat in my biryani is something that I never imagined would happen there. Will definitely avoid this place in the future.

heard that it serves the best biryani in kolkata, so went there all the way from salt lake.nice restaurant,a little bit crowdy it was.staffs are well behaved.the biryani was good,rice was really nice,smells perfect but the  unsatisfactory thing was the chicken piece.they serve really small chicken piece.i was literally searching the  chicken piece in the pile of biryani rice -_- .its disappointing.BIG TIME.and some of my friends got poor boiled potatoes which is disappointing too.for these reasons i would choose arsalan over shiraz.thank you.

Occasion was my fairly good results in second year university examinations. Sadly didn't have enough time to go out and celebrate much, so it seemed to be a good idea to go with some quality biryani. Anyways I was craving for biryani for last few days, so to satisfy the craving, I thought of Shiraz. Shiraz is well known to everyone. It's one of those olden restaurants people talk about.

Located near Park Street crossing, the restaurant has shifted to opposite side of the pavement from last time visit. Sadly enough, they don't deliver to my area which is understandable. So I had to go there for a takeaway.

Food that I ordered was Chicken Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab, Chicken Chaap, Chicken Bharta and some Raita to keep things cool. Chicken Biryani was almost perfect, very less oil used and no overpowering taste. Biryani is accompanied with a medium sized potato and a big piece of chicken. Chicken was soft and juicy. Reshmi Kebab was equally good, it was well charred and had a bit of malai on them. Boti Kebab were the best part... super-soft, just melts in the mouth. Chicken Bharta was good, a bit oily but still managable. Chicken Chaap was less oily compared to Bharta and tasted good. Raita was as it should be.

Pricing is on moderate scale, total cheque came around ₹1525 including taxes, which is normal these days. Quantity was good, don't get fooled by the biryani boxes as they may look small but packs huge quantity. Quantity of gravy items were also good. Kebabs were 6pcs per plate, very standard.

Service was fast, our order was served within 20-25 minutes. Surprisingly the place was empty so the order was served fast. Packing was good, no leaky containers. Biryani boxes were tied up properly for ease of carrying. Parking outside the restaurant is not a problem if you plan a takeaway.

Overall a much recommended restaurant to enjoy some classic Mughlai and North Indian food. If you haven't tried already, then you are missing out.

Excellent, awesome, mindblowing. What more does one need to say abt this joint, one of the oldest Mughlai joints in the city? 

After being loyal to Arsalan for over a couple of years and seeing the quality deteriorate drastically, we decided to shift our allegiance to somewhere else. So, we started trying various joints and finally our search ended with Shiraz Golden Restaurant at the Mullickbazar crossing. Not that we never tried this joint before; but we mainly used to get the food delivered.

Recently, we felt like having rediscovered the joint when we visited Shiraz a week back. The Kebabs were so juicy and subtle, one can almost feel them melting in the mouth. The Chicken Cheese Kabab simply melted in the mouth leaving us in a state of delirium.

The Biriyani had the perfect flavour and was pretty light without too much oil or dalda or "laad" (mutton fat). After a very long time, I felt as if I can gorge on a whole plate of Biriyani all by myself and might have done so, had we not had so many starters. However, a couple of days later on our 2nd visit to the restaurant, I made up for all that by finishing off a plate of Mutton Biriyani all by myself. So, no regrets and a happy tummy - what more can someone ask for?

But I disappointed with the famous chicken chanp. It taste like so ordinary. Mutton passinda, taste ok.  Staffs are decent and order delivery time was quick. Overall average experience. Nxt time visit there I will definitely try some kebabs and tandooris.

We walked around 15 min to reach Shiraz Golden Restaurant, Mallick Bazar crossing, this place need no introduction to foodies. Probably the most famous place to get haleem in Kolkata, this century-old restaurant serves up many kinds of haleem. The chicken and mutton Haleem here are equally good, come here if you can't decide then try both or the mutton hydrabadi haleem if you're adventurous!

With haleems ranging from Irani and Afghani to Hyderabadi, you will have a difficult time deciding which to pick. I say go for the Irani Haleem, one of the most iconic haleem dishes in Shiraz's menu is their Irani Haleem. With no mistakes we ordered Irani Haleem and Tandoori roti. We were bit surprised to saw complementary coke with our meal.

Irani haleem here was just mind-blowing, the best till now, simply excellent. Although it looks rather simple, this medium bowl with a seriously runny haleem complemented with mouth-watering spicy flavours and a hint of lemon makes for a perfect way to start any day. Mutton pieces were boneless and they just vanished in your mouth.

After relishing all day delectable haleems (13/07/2015) we took a taxi from mallick bazar and within 5 minute reached Q33 (Quest Mall) to enjoy drinks & desserts for a good appetizing effect.

According to me the best Mughlai food in the town is served by Shiraz. This is one of the oldest food junction of the city. From biriyani to kebabs to nan everything is more than good. Price is affordable. But the ambience is not that good,whenever I visit this place I take parcel. Please try their Mutton Reshmi Kebab once and the Keema nan.

Known for its biriyani, Shiraz is recommended by a lot of people. I wouldn't go gaga over it but yes it does serve decent biriyani. I visited during their biriyani festival specially to try out their Moti biriyani and was a tad bit disappointed. the biriyani was too dry for my liking and the "moti" too small!  their kebabs were good though and the aloo of the biriyani was good. their quantity was good. but quality wasn't up to the mark  i have had chicken chaap and roomali here before and it was better than biriyani. the waiters here are friendly in the early hours but sometimes you would find them cranky owing to their experience at that hour. the firni is good and the sitting arrangement have been renovated recenetly and looks brand new. do visit for normal kolkata style mutton biriryani much better than moti biriyani. then choose for yourself.

This used to be the famous biriyani jointof the 90s and was a favourite. Then, Arsalan took over. However, this place still serves delectable biriyani, both chicken and mutton and the firny is light, not gluey. And also, it us quieter and less chaotic than others. Good for a family meal or a business day lunch. However, the basic variation of the biriyani serves pretty small pieces of meat/ chicken.. A little disappointing.

After Rahmania and India it was Shiraz golden restaurant's day, of my mughlai food journey..
Located opposite Rahmania on the way to park circus.
Interior looked good, very mordern touch to the walls and ceilings. Even the lights were good.
ordered for brain curry, mutton korma, roti, butter naan, rumali and a biryani.
"The person taking orders needs to be briefed more on the food and the menu.
We just asked for the difference in masala kulcha, sahai kulcha?  he replied with masala kulcha is with masala and sahai kulcha is plain.
Then what is plain kulcha ? He said plain kulcha is plain.
OK
Then what is the difference in shahi and  plain kulcha? He replied shahi kulcha me thoda masala hota hai"
My friend couldn't stop laughing.... Some how it was controlled.. We politely suggested that guy to get all his food doubt clear from the chef.
On the Other part this restaurant doesn't hav any other cold beverages, except coco cola.
Food was good specially the breads it was good and it was how it should be.
Again a restaurant with over hiked name and turned to be a disappointment with an average dinning experienc !!!!!

It was sunday afternoon and we were hungry enough to slip into whatever restaurant was nearby Hind Inox. Since my friend had never been to shiraz we headed for that. Having experienced shiraz before one thing I must say that the biryani here is very light, less oil so you can gallop a little more than your normal capacity. We were two and we ordered two biryani, one veg and one chicken, one chicken kadhai. Follewed by two coke and firni of course. I liked the gravy of chicken kadhai more than the chichen itself. Firni was awesome, not to mention.

Went here specially for the existing halim festival. Loved the halim. The taste of the shredded Mutton was nice. Shiraz is special for their biriyani and its taste is auspicious! So had to taste the biriyani. Loved it as always. There is combo offer going on. Wid every plate of biriyani and halim u get a 200ml coke free. Also had masala kulcha wid chicken kadai. Kulcha was tastier being so much buttery! Kadai was fine.
The behaviour of the waiters r not good. They don't even pour water into d glasses. Leave jug in the name of self service. If ur jug empties, start calling dem. They dnt even provide any sauce or vinegar dipped chilli or onion. If u Ned a piece of lemon or green chili u have to keep calling dem and ask for it more than once.
The food is no doubt great! But service? Nope!
They r only interested in more and more orders but no cooperation.

For Mughlai dishes, it has been one of the best places in town. The biryani, kebabs and the tandoori items are perfect for anyone who craves for good and tasty mughlai dishes. 

But the haleem they serve in the month of Ramzan is pure bliss. The mutton haleem they make tastes just fine. It is neither too spicy nor too sweet. It goes well with or without any kind of bread. Personally I like to eat a bowl of this "mughlai soup"- thats precisely what it should be called alternatively, with tandoori roti. 

So enjoy the dish as few days are left before the wait begins for next year.

Guys the term eating out,dining out,restaurant all started in my life with Shiraz.It was in a different location,bang opposite to where it is now,where a jazzy hotel by the same group now stands.

It was a wonderfully democratic place where you could have carpenters and cab drivers sharing your table while you were busy polishing one of the various meat items made famous here.

Mutton Chap
Mutton Biryani
Mutton Rezala
Mutton pasanda
A killer salad prepared by the waiters if they favour you
Tandoori Roti
Firni

Of the 500 times( at least) I have eaten here,I have frolicked between these items.

Today I also got some mutton Haleem which is a Ramzan special and can surely say that amongst the wannabes and the pretenders if there is one Calcutta culinary institution,it is Shiraz.

One of the most nostalgic places for me, as this is located next my mom's office and every time I visited her in office we used to ensure that we eat in this joint. 

The decor is really nice, we generally take the seats on the first floor with the view of the ground floor. 

Of the dishes that we had tried so far, Chicken biryani, mutton biryani, Tangri kebab, Tandoori chicken and chicken chaap

I did not like the Tandoori chicken from this place, as this is very dry. Birani is always good and not to mention the chicken chaap.

For last two weeks I had been on a hunt to savour the BEST Halim my city could offer. My ventures took me to several big & famous names(read Arsalan , Aminia , Royal etc.). But my quest ended here..at Shiraz. Boy I wondered how do they make this so delectable!!!. It left me for words to describe it. Rich,subtle and everything could one think of won't even sum up to the taste that lingers on your mouth & the Quality & Quantity is overwhelming. Freinds if you want to savour this Ramzan speciality  then I suggest to you just go there and have a taste of their Gosht/Chicken Shahi Haleem. They have also other variaties like Irani/Afghani/Hyderabadi, but didn't taste them so can't comment on those, but this Gosht Haleem,oh!! one spoonful in your mouth & Nirvana!!!

Shiraz needs no introduction to Biriyani loving people of Kolkata. Time to time Shiraz has proved itself to be the biriyani king of Kolkata, the awards hanging on the walls of the restaurant are the prove.
I have been going to shiraz since I was a kids, and if I remember correctly this is the place where I discovered the awesome taste of fragrance rice with succulent meat piece coupled with silky soft potato for the first time in my life.
I'm last couple of years everything has changed. The old shiraz now houses the upscale dawat e shiraz and right opposite to that houses the old famous, Shiraz the Golden Restaurant.
Decor wise this place looks modern with nice centralised air conditioning. Seating arrangements are quite comfortable. The ground floor is always full of people, while the upstairs the ambiance is quite and nice.
We knew we were late but still we asked for Halim and we got the obvious answer that it's not in stock. It was not disheartening but then we ordered 4 rumali roti, two tandoori roti, 1 mutton pasinda, 2 mutton biriyani and 1 firni for our sit and dine part. And packed 4 firni, 1 veg pulao, 1 paneer butter masala.
The rumali rotis were soft and made fresh and are huge in diameter. The tandoori rotis had the perfect softness and both looked and tasted perfect. Mutton pasinda was shredded boneless mutton in semi thick sauce. The pieces of mutton were well cooked melt in your mouth type and proved to be the perfect companion with the rotis. Next came the star of the show mutton biriyani. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The piece of meat was succulent and had its juices intact inside and the potato (which to me most of the people like in Kolkata biriyani) was perfectly cooked and had a mild flavours from the spices. The biriyani was light on the taste buds yet left the taste buds lingering and in desire for more. But as the stomach has its own limit we stopped. However not before we gulp down the mighty firni. The firni was chilled to perfection and was not overpowering sweet.
The service was prompt and the people were polite with smile on their faces.
Over all a great experience after a long time. Shiraz is a part of nostalgia and it's still satisfying people's taste buds.

Now who doesn't know about one of the best Biryani Places in Kolkata..Been there a couple of times and enjoyed each time!!
Location...It is located at the Mullickbazar-Park street crossing,easy to spot...
Ambience....Nothing special but good enough..The staffs were courteous and helpful...and their recommendations always turned out to be perfect..
Food-Now coming to their biryani...I personally think it beats that of arsalan park Street outlet hands down..don't know about the park circus one though..
Other items worth mentioning are Chicken Rezala,Chicken Chap,all of their kebabs
Cost--I feel the cost is very moderate...for 2 it always comes around Rs 500.
Allover...I am a fan of this restaurant though many people complain..and I keep going there and I enjoy myself to the delicacies every time....I must say its a worth go...at least one time

The Best Biriyani indeed, though sometimes found not so heart warming Biriyani here ... I visited four to five times here and had veg as well as non veg foods, but veg foods were quite tasty rather non veg ones ...

Well the name that is synonymous with Biriyani... But during the Holy month of Ramzan.. The only thing for which people hunt this place is Haleem.. 
Afgani, Irani, Hyderabadi and Shriraz Special Haleem are the available options and is definitely a finger licking item to be tasted.. 
Hyderabadi is definitely the best of the lot.

Went there for a Haleem dinner today with family and was dissapointed on many a ground.
1st, Haleem was over, the staff said that Haleem is usually over by 5p.m.. which means a Haleem dinner at Shiraz is never going to happen for me, unless I parcel it for dinner. :/
Dissapointed and sad as I was, I decided to try their usual items instead of stepping out of the place. Ordered Chicken Biriyani for my dad.. My mom n I decided to have Mutton Pasinda, which used.to be a rage when I was in college some yrs ago. With that came Tandoori Roti. The chicken in chicken biriyani was so tiny that my dad was really disgusted. The taste wasn't out of the world too, Arsalaan Biriyani is way better in terms of taste n quantity. Mutton Pasinda tasted quite the same as i had long back, just the quantity has now become way lesser n d gravy oilier. The mixed raita which was ordered along with onion salad was average. After eating all this, we decided to order something else, as we weren't satisfied with the food so far. Keema Naan n a Chicken Bharta were ordered, only to satiate our appetite. Thankfully both came out to be decent this time. Overall experience wasn't great. Service was fast n staff well-behaved. Shiraz food however, is over-hyped. Hopefully they make qualitative and quantitative changes to maintain the reputation they have earned over so many years.

Though Shiraz has been beaten at their one time famous Biriyani they are better known for their Awadhi cuisine. The bhuna gosht, butter naan, garlic naan and their firni remains unbeatable even today.

Shiraz used to be the name that comes in minds when someone asked about where to get the best biriyani. Now, those days are gone and Shiraz has lost the authenticity it used to have. There are some legendary names in town for serving best class biriyani but this place is long gone from that list.

What it offers however is decent grade food items that most wouldn't complain about but those who have seen its glory days would doubt that. The ambience has nothing too special about it and so is the service. It's a good option for people in the are to grab a bite if they feel like having sort of items Shiraz has to offer.

Hungry? Love to Mughlai/North Indian food or you a fan of Biriyani? If you are any of them and you are near park street area don't miss this awesome place called Shiraz Golden Restaurant ! Its a place whom you could come with anyone. If you want to go for ambiance then shiraz is not your call; the ambiance is average. But for real North Indian food lovers its heaven. People who are not fond of average ambiane may opt for take away also. Service is really fast. During the heavy load of durga pujas also they manage to keep the flow.Staffs are well behaved. Now the most most important part, from the kebabs to the biriyani (specially mutton * as its my own favorite) , from kulcha to mutton rogan josh to chicken bharta , go for them all!! And don't  forget to have their Firni. It really tastes great!! Overall, never miss this place. Its a real treat for foodies!

U luv mughlai, But dont want to feel a heavy stomach after ur food exploits, this is the place I recommend. 
After my mother, if there is any place which wud hav aroused my love for biryani, it wud obviously be this one.I hav been having food in Shiraz since long back when my father used to take us on Sundays. Even when it used to be situated on the opp side of the road and had an open terrace.
Unlike other mughlai joints lyk Arsalan this has maintained its standards in keeping its food less rich and less heavy on the stomach but equally tasty. The biryani and Tandoori are to die for. Not to forget the various chicken and mutton gravy dishes on the menu which are equally tasty.
My tryst with this place dates long enough for me to call it a lite relationship 😊

I had visited here several times with family and friends. Last time I was here with my friends. It was a birthday treat from him. We ordered chicken Biryani, mutton Biryani and chicken tikka kebab. Chicken tikka was awesome. It was soft and tasty. But the Biryani failed to impress. It was not like the old Biryani I used to have. Potato in Biryani was not boiled properly. The ambience and service was good. One must try Chicken tikka kebab.

The bane Shiraz is quite big in the biriyani world and it had been so for ages now. There was a time when Biriyani lovers could swear by just the name of Shiraz but off let their standards have gone down a bit. Recently picked up food from this place and to my surprise it was actually not bad. Definitely not a good as zeeshan or arsalan but good enough !!

Growing up as a Xaverian...this used to be my dine zone mostly. I have grown up with the Shiraz Biriyanis..the Chicken Bhunas...the Pasindas and the kebabs and the firnis.
My visit to this shop after the monsoons arrive was a special one. Lunch time. I ordered the mutton pasinda..tandoori roti and a mutton biriyani. The courteous waiter and his smile, was nice. The pasinda was the same like my old days. The tandoori roti...is amazing and is a big round well roasted piece. The Biriyani here is always special for me. The soft n tender mutton and potato...just perfect. The thing I like most here...their Biriyani is purely aroma...not very spice oriented like the Arsalans. Hence I always enjoy the Biriyani here. All in all...nice experience again and I have seen the Biriyani price from 45/- per plate to 175/- per plate today.
A Shiraz fan. :)

It is near the Mallik bazar area which is quiet easy  to reach. Its the main outlet of Shiraz and is known for its quality Mughlai Food. Now speaking of the food its very good and near to reasonable. Mutton biriyani and laccha paratha are a must try if you ever visit Shiraz. Side dishes may consist of chicken bhuna masala or mutton chap. Starters of mughlai khana consists of a wide range of kebabs [ almost everyone is good ]. Firni would be a great option to end your menu.

Supposedly the Benchmark Name for Mughlai Food in Kolkata - Shiraz Golden Restaurant just off the AJC Bose Road Crossing with Park Street is a place I have eaten at since the last 35 years at least ... They are the place for the Best Dal Gosht, Mutton Stew, Mutton Paya, Keema, Liver which are so welcome every Winter Morning for Breakfast. A favourite of the Pathans, most of the Breakfast items are sold out by 8:30 am so one needs to be there early and they start serving 5:30 am onwards ...
Their Biryanis are excellent and have tasted the same always. Right now they are having a Biryani Festival and I tried out their much raved about Shaadi Biryani But very Frankly I could not see much of a difference between their regular Special Mutton Biryani & the Shaadi Biryani ...both have 2 pcs of mutton and 1 Potato and same Long Grain Basmati ... The Latter is of course much more expensive.
I must say I am a little Disappointed with their Chicken Chaps of late ... Just not the same as before ... Some thing has changed here !!! They need to look at it & I am sure they will ...

My partner and I visited this mughlai haven last Friday after a long time.... We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken chanp, chicken reshmi kabab n tandoori roti... The service was prompt and courteous... Our food arrived within 5 mins... The reshmi kabab was okay... Though the meat was tender and juicy it was on the spicier side... The biriyani reminded me what gastronomic bliss was though my partner complained the mutton piece had very little meat... The chanp was perfect in terms of spice and taste but had too much oil... The gravy was very little and oil was floating on the plate... Tandoori roti was very soft and went nicely with the chanp.... We ended our meal with shahi tukda.... It was one of the tastiest Indian dessert I have ever had... The bread pudding with kheer just made our day... The bill came around rs. 650 which was totally worth it except for the reshmi kebab... P.S. the prices have gone up a lot , zomato should upload new prices asap

THIS REVIEW IS SOLELY BASED ON HALEEM:It was the last day of haleem being available for the year 2014, and we realised that we have not tasted haleem anywhere that year. So out we went bunking classes in search of haleem.. It was 2 in the afternoon and Nizam, Arsalan, Zeeshan everyone said haleem is only available after 3:30.. we couldn't wait till then and so Shiraz was the only option left. The waiter who attended us was very friendly.A few minutes of wait And then came the dish! The sizzling haleem with tandoori roti.. It was nice but tad different from the image of haleem I had in my mind from the haleem I had had in Hyderabad. The friendly waiter asked us how it tasted.. these small gestures really made up for everything else. The white interiors was soothing to the eye and a stark contrast to the environment outside. It can be a bit difficult to find out, given to its location in park circus area but I would definitely be there again to try their biryani :)

From my early college days Shiraj is my favorite dining destination. I loved their Biryani whatever it is mutton  or chicken. Even their kebab and other dishes were excellent. Gradually with time they have lost their charm, the food does not taste the same. The quality have been deteriorated. With the entrance of other joints like Arsalan, Zeeshan, Alibaba & others in the market, Shiraz is facing a tough competition. Their firni is still the best...

Biriyani lovers should try at least once .. Not sooo very fabulous but biriyani was good .. And the main important thing is their food quantity which is very good .. I have tried Shiraz special kebab for starter which is really mouth watering and Chicken special biriyani with Chicken kosha for main course .. Now last but not the least "SHAHI TUKRA" a must try for desert .. I would say food quality is nice ..

Occasion  - A Team dinner & THE MUGHLAI BIRIYANI FESTIVAL!

:'(  I regret going here ! 
Could enjoy the dinner only because of the group I was with. The food wasn't that good. The chewy chicken & the mutton made the entire thing a disaster.

After the starters it was the biriyani reason why we had thought of going to this place. So majority ordered as per the recommendation by the staff that was Yakhni Biriyani & Moti Biriyani. Honestly couldnt differentiate much . All I could figure out was Yakhni was little on the sweeter side relatively. ( don't mean Sweet here) . The excitement level increased seeing the generous amount of meat in the biriyani but again.....

Only thing that could pep up my mood & tempt my taste buds was the last order - Bheja Fry Masala! Its was delicious & could break the monotony. 

Will think twice the next time before going to Shiraz.

I have been going here since childhood. My father was regular in his younger days. One thing is for sure that its food are quite tasteful. People like biriyani of Shiraz but my favourite is Chicken bharta and butter nan. Now a days everyone should be health conscious and thus i keep this in mind while reviewing. These biriyaniwalas are using heavy amount of DALDA. Why i don't understand because they don't charge cheap and yet they use cheap ingredient. But tastewise shiraz is good. Keep in mind that it is not always empty. Good servicing and dining.

I've been going to Shiraz since 2002. My dad introduced the laccha paratha, kashmiri chicken, mutton biriyani, rezala, chicken chaap and firni. I was 9 years old and fell in love with this place. We kept on visiting the restaurant with family over the years and recently I've discovered that the taste, quality and quantity all have deteriorated. I still order the above mentioned dishes like dad taught me but along with this I've tried their Reshmi kabaab, chicken harabhara kabaab, tandoori chicken and chicken butter masala. They are all quite good but my love for mouthwatering Biriyani, kashmiri chicken and firni will last forever.

Do visit. :)

Shiraz and it's biriyani have been famous in Kolkata since ages but unfortunately for the past few years they are not being able to maintain their food standard.
Though quite recently they have redecorated this place unfortunately their biriyani is not as good as it once used to be, it's definitely a shame. But still the mutton rezela is mouth watering till now, the bread section comprising of kulchas, and tandoori roti and nuns is the best section for sure. Their rolls are still quite good, but I would genuinely ask the management to up their game a bit, its really sad to see their standard fall with time. They are a brand and should look into both their staff and chefs. Phirni is a dish one must try here, it's really nice. As for the biriyani, for the time being it should be skipped. It's dry and quite bland.

Shiraz; First of all people who do not want to get sick, please ignore this restaurant. It's an unhygienic place to be in. Being so old in this food business, they have waiters who hammer the glasses of water on the table, burp while serving & even stares at you like scaring crows.
Everything in here so negative & bad.
Ordered for paratha, mutton rogan josh, chicken biryani & mixed green salad... Well I consider this visit of mine as a learning experience...
A great story ahead...
They served Rogan josh as white watery soup kinda thing in a bowl with just a piece of mutton. When complained that this is not a rogan josh, Mr Waiter says that though it is printed in the menu card that they have this item but they serve rezala instead of this dish whenever people ask for rogan josh...
Huh??? Isn't it complicated????
Goodness Gracious, the waiter wanted us to have rezala instead of what we ordered... What place is this man??? I continuously asked to change that pathetic watery dish or else I won't pay for it, the waiter said I have to pay and have it.
Felt like boxing his ears & shout at the top of my voice...
Well after a long argument, he got me mutton chaap; sheh!!! It was the Yuckiest thing I had in my life. It was sticking, there was some fat floating over the dish... How they make the food, what they pour in??? I don't know... I really don't wanna go back to this restaurant!!!
Parathas were so hard that even after brushing twice a day, I doubted my brush & the toothpaste... My jaws were cursing me man!!! I definitely would have played Frisbee with that or made pyramids... Biryani is spice less, tasteless with just boiled chicken and essence of some biryani flavour. I relied on salad only.
I don't know how this place is still standing there with such poor food quality and service standards.

DO NOT LET YOUR HEALTH AND MIND GET SICK by going in there...!!!

Thank You

Personally I have been going to this place since time immemorial..this has been an old family favourite..For me Shiraz and Biriyani were synonimous until a certain time..Though their quantity has reduced over the years..the mutton portions are no longer as big as they used to be..still this place will give other big players a run for their money..Last time I visited I had:
Mutton Biriyani: Non greasy,light and what is most important they dont add any artificial colours..still prefer the light pinkish texture of thier biriyani..
Mutton Chaap: Each portion is sufficient to serve two people,the rich brownish texture,ghee oozing out from beneath,perfectly cooked mutton chunks will instantly make you hungry..forget your diet,this is heavenly sin!!
Shiraz Special Kebab: A nicely charred cheese quoted affairs..it serves 8 huge pieces that you may find difficult to finish..
Mutton Pasinda: Boneless chunks of mutton cooked to perfection..loved the spices and flavours in this dish..
Mutton Kakori Kebab: As soft as it can get..blends well with parathas..
Firni: Loved the flavours of saffron,nice and thick..perfect finish to your meal..
Overall the cheque comes around 1200/- for a takeaway of all these stuffs.so definitely pocket friendly..

Certainly not the best of Kolkata Biryanis . Sometimes served cold during low rush hours. Lacks the aroma of a good Mughlai restaurant. Rolls are somewhat better but still not amongst the best. Overall I personally feel this to be one overhyped place.

There is no better place than this if you want to try out some delicious Awadhi Biryani in Kolkata! If you are in the city don't, just DO-NOT miss out the opportunity of gorging some mouth-watering tengri kebabs, mutton biryani, mutton champ & the delicious shahi tukra or firni over here. You will do your taste-buds a favor!

Like every Bengali, I am a huge fan of Biriyani, infact being a little more precise ardent fan the specific Kolkata's Biriyani. I have been across to various city, starting from Delhi to Pune to Mumbai to now the famous Hyderabad but none of them tastes half as good as that you get in here. Shiraz has this huge reputation of its biriyani, however i am more fond of the Arselan biriyani, but still taking nothing away from this place. Rich heritage, great food and great taste. If you are a Biriyani lover, this is a must visit place for you in Kolkata. Apart from that few dishes like the Rezala, Chanp also adds to your taste buds. Not at all expensive, pretty healthy for the wallet too.

Happy Munchin :)

nothing to write about it.grew up eating shiraz biryanis.shiraz is among the top awadhi players.one thing I want to say.that not all mutton pices are from the biryani are the tultule naram,tender--est,,hehe,what we crave for(chewing not neded,the mutton must melt in mouth).maybe its due to less time heating up.uneven heating or whatever.always ask the waiter or give him advance tips to get the succulent tender--est best mutton.however this can happen in any cooking however strict be the process.but the restaurant must maintain strict quality that all pieces from handi to plate must be the same best quality.they can increase the price to maintain that
very very bad experience,cant expect this from shiraz,raita were stale,not edible,biryani muttons were uncooked,hardddd,had to throw them away literally,the full parcel was frustrating,cannot expect this from shiraz,i previously gave 4 stars,now it is 2 star

To “Rate” this type on legendary restaurant is not so easy I think. After all this Biriani House is running since many years and become a brand. My rate will be 4.5, for ambiance & stuff behavior. This Biriyani house is located at Mullick Bazar crossing. The best part of their biriani is less oil & less rich…  after finishing 1 plate everybody will go for other one.  You can visit here with your family also. There is two part of the restro.. lower house & upper house. Both are centrally air conditioned. 

Price is also pocket friendly. You will get tanduri items here also. I have been there several times. 

Must try……

Though am not a great fan of Mughlai or Biryani but the only other place apart from Noor Mohammadi of Mumbai that I would love to visit for mughlai cuisine is Shiraz. Have had amazing biryani and chicken curry here. The ambience isn't great but who cares if the food is to die for. A must of all mughlai lovers and also for those who haven't appreciated mughlai food thus far. You will not be disappointed.

This place is a frequent stop for us since many years as my family loves to have biriyani almost every alternate sundays. We mostly take away chicken/mutton biriyanis,mutton pasinda(recommended) or chap & tandooris/kebabs to compliment it. Their quantity is ideal for 1 person & they use good quality & authentic spices to make you crave for more. Prices are very reasonable considering the taste & quality. A must visit if you love biriyanis. Cheers!!

Shiraj golden restuarant on park street is a delight for Biriyani lovers in Kolkata. I visited with my friend to quench the thirst (err.. Hunger) for biriyani after a long time. I went to the park street out for it being the main brunch, and the Biriyani was chopped here and served to the other franchisee. We preferred to stick to a very simple menu, Biriyani and chicken rezala. The former was moist, flavourful and the meat was well cook as expected. The Zafran yogurt gravy of the rezala was also mildly flavoured and tasted delicious. But the real beauty of the meal was the Shaahi Tukra! Anyone who loves mughlai food knows about how the puny little bread slice turns into a heavenly delicacy when dipped into saffron milk and dressed in dry pistachio. A must try! Finally the ambiance.. Every modern restaurant in Kolkata concentrates well on there interior for an amalgamated optic-olfactory pleasure and Shiraz in nowhere less in the race.

I asked people for recommendations on fb and twitter for good biryani places and everyone mentioned Shiraz. Visited it for dinner last evening. 
I don't like dry biryani. I prefer biryanis with masala and gravy so I knew the Kolkata biryani will not be upto the mark for me. BUT, keeping my bias aside I did like the dish. I also ordered chicken kassa and it was very tasty. Oily but tasty.
All in all a good place and value for money

The name of Shiraz is associated with all the Biryani lovers of the town.
I mean people like us have literally grown up with the Biryani bigshots like Shiraz.Back in the late 90s every second and fourth Sunday was meant for Mutton Rezalla,Tandoori Roti,Chicken Biryani and Firni.
No wonder I had put up so much of weight back then.

In the 21st century Shiraz stands out as the epitome of Biryani Restaurants in Kolkata.And this branch now being the oldest of the lot,has been made the headquarters of this famous chain of restaurants.
The price of a sumptuous platter of Biryani has gone up by four fold at least, but that antique smell still remains the same.
Having tasted the same dish from so many restaurants,and of course listening to the opinions of many food lovers,it is true that Shiraz Biryani makers add the Kashmiri Jaffran to the Biryani(maybe the only Biryani joint in Kolkata to do so).
And on top of that the egg also comes with the dish.

Due to stiff competition in the market the enthusiasm for Shiraz's Biryani has been hampered.As of now you get multiple food joints all over Kolkata serving the same dish,cooked in various styles.
One good thing about this restaurant is that they have introduced new dishes like the Murg Masallam which comes in half and full plate.
The kebabs of Shiraz bear a fresh taste and the tender juicy chicken leave a mark in your tongue....

My request to you foodies will be enjoy the taste of Shiraz,gulp down everything with a glass of Cola.I can guarantee you that 100% hygienic burp will be worth remembering!!!

This generation of food lovers like us really admire restaurant chains like Shiraz,which have maintained their standard for ages.What Kolkata needs now is a variation of the age old Awadhi Biryani which we are always having.
A new recipe will not only generate new business but also revolutionize the Awadhi Biryani.

What can one probably write about magnificence...Ones who are ardent Biriyani Worshippers swear by this iconic joints each strand of pulchritudinous Biriyani's rice. No two grains of rice are ever attached to each other and when if you have that last stand of aromatic haven remaining as the unspoken story of the love affair you just indulged with, I sometimes feel like flushing all the piped up glory with a gasp out of tears of joy. This is not food but this a magic which manifests your senses and captures your imagination. Once you painfuly and after a lot of hardship get to divert your attention from the Biriyanis.... the Raita is the bets you will ever get in kolkata and that i can vouch for with my life..(feels like i am already possessed by them) . The right amount of salt and sweet freshness of the curd and the vegetables and that black salt and chilli powder creating a potion that is almost to me the elixir of life. I have had the good fortunes of ordering and having their Khasi Tangri Kebab for a party i was organising for my friends and trust me the day i had than succulent chunk of mutton to galore upon I thanked and god for making me a non vegetarian.......... In all The love affair continues

Another trademark restaurant in the city of foodies. It competes with the likes of Arsalan, Ali Baba etc. For some, this is the the best the city has to offer. The food is actually pretty good here. The biriyani, tandoori dishes are quite the delicacies here. The flavour of the dishes are totally different from what other restaurants offer. The decor and ambience of the place can be a lil disappointing to few but it is alright. The food is that matters. The service is also quite good. The total experience here will be something that you will enjoy. If not everything, at least you will enjoy the food very well. The pricing of the products are also quite reasonable. One of the places one must visit in Calcutta.

Shiraaz is nostalgia for me. My uncle used to bring chicken chaap and tandoori roti during my childhood days (early 90s) and that was my first stint with mughlaai food. The tradition continued during my years at St.Xavier's College. Shiraaz was cheap and delicious - less impact on the pocket money along with finger licking food - a perfect combination for a college student.

The main dish at Shiraaz - Mutton Biryani is stupendous. A subtle taste with the use of fragrant spices - a lucknowi hint right here at Kolkata. The use of aloo is obviously the Kolkata culture going by the Bahadur Shah tradition.

Along with this Chicken and Mutton chaap - now you don't find the man cooking the chaap outside the restaurant all day long which used to be a regular affair earlier filling the air at Mullickbazaar with tremendous smell. The quality of chaap is still the same - it is not as spicy as the Royal Indian hotel version but definitely very good and unique in its own kind.

Other than this mutton bara kebab, chicken reshmi, kasturi kebab, fish tandoori are good but not exceptional.

In side dishes Mutton pasinda stands out - brilliant. Other than this Mutton Qalia, Korma, Rezala, Masala, Ghee kebab, Chicken kashmiri, Chicken masala are good - oily, spicy and tasty.

I would definitely recommend Shiraaz to all food lovers.

Terrific in one word. The Galauti kebab & Mutton Biriyani must be the best in Kolkata. And I am saying this after having tasted authentic biriyani cooked by the descendants of Nawab Wajed Ali Shah @ Matiabruz!! Don't forget to order their sweet Bekti tandoori kebabs. At the end you have to have the firni. The pista simply melts in your mouth with real fine rice 'payesh' which is simply not available at Arsalan.

I went to Shiraz thrice in three consecutive weeks. I've tasted some of the best and worst Biryanis in Kolkata. When my colleagues recommended me this place, I had no reason to disagree because Shiraz was in my Must-Go list for quite some time.

I'm writing this review intentionally after 3 months of my visit to Shiraz to see whether I still remember the experience or it was just a fluke. To my surprise, I can recall almost everything I liked about this place. Let’s proceed, shall we?

It’s located right on the Park Circus-Mullick Bazar crossing. From the first look it may look like a congested and local eatery but try one spoonful of their Biryani and you’ll know why Shiraz has been catering to the Calcuttan’s ever growing demand of Mughlai Biryani since years with pride and élan.

We visited this place on weekdays so had no difficulty finding our preferred seats. If you want to avoid the crowd and seek some privacy, try their first floor seating arrangement. We knew what we were going to order; Mutton Biryanis, and Firnis in dessert. This place is a bit pricey than the other Biryani lords on the block but in return you’ll get to experience mouth-watering delicacies at their best. What I love the most about their Biryani is that there’s something to relish in every bite. The rice used in their Biryani is slender, smooth and unbroken. It was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices accompanied by pieces of tender meat and juicy potatoes.

Very few people are aware that Kolkata is THE place to eat Biryani. You’ve heard about Lucknowi Biryani, Hyderabadi Biryani but never Calcuttan Biryani. Maybe it’s because you've never been to Shiraz so far.

Shiraz is one of the most popular Awadhi Cuisine restaurants in Kolkata. People say Biryani is their speciality. And I too loved their Mutton Biryani. But what impressed me more was their Tandoori Roti-Chicken Chaap combination. However their Mutton Barra Kebab was a let down, as it wasn't cooked well. So, I would suggest don't try kebabs here. Ambience is fine, neither great, nor bad.

Shiraz, The name itself is so delicious.
Authentic north Indian food. Shiraz makes the best biryani, rezalas and firnis in the city. The tandoor cuisine is one of the finest in the city. Shiraz's special murg mussallam is also a must try. One cannot stop and in the end your stomach is overloaded but you still feel like having more.. :P 
What is not consistent is the quality and size of the mutton portion served in their mutton biryani. 

The only reason for the above average rating is the not so impressive  ambience.
Otherwise, it would deserve a 5star

Located opposite to Rahmania in Parkstreet adjacent to Institute of Neuroscience Kolkata(INK), this restro is  known for its age old tradition of making excellent biryanis. The kebabs and tandoori are quite satisfying. The rolls are also satisfactory. Ambience is typical of old biryani restaurants , although they modernized a few years back. Pocket pinch per person would be around Rs 400.

Shiraz is one of the oldest biryani joints in kolkata, there was a time when kolkata's biryani was represented by brand "Shiraz". In the new era of kolkata biryani, many new outlet names appeared with quality food and become famous. In my childhood all my touchiness used to vaporized, seeing my father carrying "Shiraz" named boxes. A box of happiness :)

After many years later just stepped in Park Street Shiraz. Reached at 3:00 noon and loved this place, simple decor, busy waiters and satisfying foodies filling their stomach with kebabs, biryanis and chaps.

Just wanted to try kebab and biryani so ordered Chicken biryani and "Malai til Kebab".  Mind blowing is the perfect word to express the taste of the kebab, It was simply great, I can put this in my kebab list as one of the best kebabs I had till now. Sesame coated perfectly grilled kebabs, soft juicy and I personally like the spices that they had used It was perfectly balanced. 5 of 5 just for the kebab. Next the biryani, It just remembered me my childhood memories as It didn't fall It's quality still it's holding the same old Shiraz biryani taste. The aroma, rice the chicken everything was nicely cooked to perfection. Loved it.

All I can say Park street Shiraz is still alive. It's your turn to join them and had the aroma and satisfactory plate of kebab and biryani.

Shiraz's mutton biriyani (paired with chicken chnaap) is the closest to heaven you'll get on earth. If you like your Calcutta style biriyani with a well-boiled potato and egg, this is the place to be. 
There are challengers to Shiraz's throne now but they are just as good as they always were.

Been going here since the age of 3,and have loved it since then.
Since my dad's shop is very close,he has been bringing me here since ages,and it has never disappointed me. All the waiters there know both of us and they're very friendly and kind,and always treat their regulars very specially. Despite many changes in the place in all these years,it hasn't dropped in serving proper quality food,and hence is regarded as one of Calcutta's best restaurants for Mughlai cuisine. Its biryani is to die for,and it is so tasty that people swear by it. Besides the famous Chaap and Rezala,the Mutton Pasinda is a must try,and is a fine accompaniment for the biryani.
Shiraz is a must visit for anyone coming to Calcutta, as it is the finest example of the famous biryani of the city.
As a loyal customer I'll always recommend Shiraz to anyone who wants to have some amazing biryani.

I guess the name Shiraz is not anonymous to any food lover of kolkata. This place has been the ultimate choice for anyone's north indian and awadhi cravings for decades. It is very hard to find a person with a mughlai pallette who never tried out biriyani in Shiraz. I have been here a couple of times, though they have recently renovated but still the decor of this place is nothing fussy and posh. To be honest people doesn't come here for the ambience but for their culinary expertise of awadhi cuisine. Be it biriyanis(kacchhi and pakki), mutton/chicken rezalas, chaps, tandoori, kababs, naans etc, everything is flawless as far as the taste is concerned. Their "firnis" are just heaven, one of the best i've ever tried till date. People those are not a fitness freak and doesn't care about the amount of calories and fat their dish contains, this place is a paradise for them.

Had RESHMI KABAB, CHICKEN TANDOORI and CHICKEN RAYTA here... All the dishes were awesome and was surprised to find chatni given with the food (not a culture in Kolkata).
Ambience is very good and service is also prompt. 
Can't comment on the rates though, it was a treat :-D didn't have to pay any money ;-)

When it comes to biriyani people talk about arsalan, trust me shiraz can beat arsalan when it comes to biriyani any day. I can eat a plate of shiraz's biriyani even after having my dinner or lunch. The biriyani is so well prepared, the chicken or mutton in it is gigantic. Though the restaurant wont top any charts when it comes to décor or ambiance. But the food they serve is awesome. The prices are reasonable, and the food (especially biriyani) is heavenly.

They are one of the oldest biryani eatouts in kolkata. I am a big fan of their biryani. They have a particular fragrance in the dish that makes it too too good. The only problem is that the place is a bit cramped up, but apart from that there is no compromise on the food.

Location: location is nice in the sense of accessibility . the surrounding or the outside of the shop wont appeal many.
Ambience: Ok. Nothing great.
Service: fine. Doesnt deserve any special mention
Food: obviously the only reason one drop in there. I love their biriyani,kebabs and tandoori.
The best thing i find about shiraz is that they are consistent. Like many other eateries their quality/taste doesnt vary time to time.
If dropping there is not one's cup of tea they should take away the parcel:)

Mutton chap, biryani of all types (I prefer mutton), 'lal' tandoori roti; enough said. Ok, maybe add a mutton rezaala. 

Kolkata is probably the only city where you would find a whole potato in your biryanis, but it taste awesome. The mutton chap looks quite scary with the oil floating around the minced meat. Once you dip your roti into the meat and oil, there is no stopping. The thick roti absorbs all the oil and the mutton is tender, spicy and heavenly. In no time the plate of mutton chap is clean with no sign of the oil even. Order the rezaala if you like curd based sweet tasting mutton gravy.

Very close to my college, me n my frienf often hit this place during breaks to have their soft and juicy Tangri kabab! mmmmm its awesome!  i dnt like the chutney served with it, so i avoid it. its staple for me whenever i go to this place nw. the biryani i like very much. big piece of potato, equally big piece of chicken well cooked. portion is really large. the chicken reshmi kabab is another jewel, melt in the mouth chunk of chicken, a delight to the tastebuds! i also tried the brain masala which was not as tasty as i expected it to be. it was slightly on the sweeter side lacked the robustness. it was really average.==================================================================================================7.1.15 Recently been there  for a birthday treat. Ordered Tangri kababs, Shiraz special kababs, Kadhai chicken, Chicken spl biriyanis, and firni. everything was nice except the Shiraz special kabab, the chicken pieces were coated in batter an then tandoored, it was not juicy and the chicken was not cooked very well. another thing which we noticed was that the chicken pieces in the kadhai chicken were tiny but the gravy was very robust n rich. the chicken in the biriyani was so hard n chewy n the size was also very small. overall the meal was good enough. P.S- the waiters dont even serve u water so you have to help yourself which can be super annoying. previously rated it 4 but now 3.5.

Good place for dinner..You can come here with your friends,family or relatives,The food is just awesome,you can try biryani,chanp,or any other mughlai dish,you will just say "Wah Shiraz" in inner of you..

The interior is good,and the staff service is fast and they  speaks to you in a polite manner..

One thing I find different in this restaurant that there is one leader of waiter,that gives waiter instructions to deal with customers,so that the service can be more quicked till u realize..

Must go restaurant,if u have not visit this restaurant you have miss the real taste of mughlai food..

Food: some say this is the best biriyani house in kolkata. But after experiencing arsalan i am not so sure about shiraz. When i visited shiraz i had mutton biriyani and kebabs. Kebabs were good but could have been more tender. Biriyani was awesome. The rice, the aroma and the meat - all perfect but somehow i felt arsalan is just a bit better than them. Its my personal opinion of course.

Ambience and service: service was not very good. So was the ambience. But considering the price you pay for its ok i guess.

Price: price is well within reach. So this wont burn a hole in your pocket for sure.

It is my opinion that you should atleast visit this place once. It is said to be one of the best biriyani houses in kolkata. There are die hard fans of shiraz out there. So just for the sake of comparison with others you should pay a visit.

Shiraz has always been a by-word for Biryani and a safe haven for Biryani Lovers. Off late their quality had suffered, so I avoided it completely. But yesterday my Eid Dinner came from their Park Street Golden Restaurant and my faith in their food was once more restored.

We Ordered Laccha Parathas with Chicken Chaap and Chicken Bhuna, Mutton Pasinda, Chicken Reshmi Kebabs and of course their Special Chicken Biryanis.

All the items were well prepared. Their Biryani is back to being top-notch. The Chicken Bhuna variation they offered was different but went well with the items ordered. The Chaap was delicious and the Mutton Pasinda a class of it's own. The Laccha Parathas were a bit on the heavier side, but were soft and crisp at the same time. The Chicken Reshmi Kebabs were soft, succulent and flavourful.

I have been a long standing customer of Shiraz and I find it satisfactory to have my faith restored. Keep up the good work.

It was one my desire to visit that place for a long time. Ultimately i quenched my thirst by visiting at that place. Thanks to one of my dearest one. Well at first glance the ambiance was good. Really comfortable. Renovated floors, nice & clean  tables. As we were really hungry we ordered chicken tandoori, 1 chicken biriyani, 1 chicken chap, 1 chicken bhuna, 3 tandoori roti, onion salad and lastly the firni. I must say the quality is really good. I mean every bit of the food was really tasty. & it becomes more tasty when somebody is feeding it to. But was really disappointed when tasted the firni. It was the only item that was lagging the tag of shiraz. It could have been better. Well i am hoping again  to visit this place very soon and also expecting the firni to get better.

I grew up on "Shirazer biriyani" – biriyani from Shiraz and their awesome, unforgetable chaap (mutton is my favorite, although the chicken is just as good), and every time I go back to the city, having the biriyani and chaap from Shiraz is a must. The biriyani is , of course, legend. There are many new places that have come up in that area, but Shiraz is top on my list. The biriyani is light, yes it is oily, but the taste is something that you get totally addicted to. The chaap is a greasy preparation of soft, on-the-bone mutton pieces that simmers on a large tawa for hours, and here again, this is what Kolkata memories are made of. Their rumaii rotis are fantastic as well and go really well with the chaap. The razela is world class, and the prices are totally reasonable. If, like us, you visit the city occasionally, Shiraz should be on your "must do" list.

Shiraz opened a branch in Dubai a couple of years ago, but it seems to have just disappeared. Which is a shame, really.

It is not where you will expect an ambience and adda for long hours over food.. it is come-eat-go kinda place without wasting much time.. Ambience is okay.. Service is quick but nothing to rave about.. Shiraz used to serve very good Biryani and Mutton pasinda.. but quality has degraded a lot in this past few years.. though its a heritage place being one of the oldest place selling biryanis.. I used to go to shiraz regularly.. but nowadays in Kolkata there are better options to have Biryani.. so give it a miss!!

This is one of the oldest brands of the city. People got used to the mughlai culture in the city via this brand along with Nizam and Aminia. There was a time when Shiraz used to appeal to the city, but it has been a real disaster the downfall of the brand over the years. Starting from the biriyani to the fast food(rolls), the quality of food has degraded drastically. Yet because of the nostalgia the brand still has its charm which I believe is long lost.....

When Nabab Wajed Ali of lucknow was defeated , he was sent to kolkata . He made kolkata his second home. With him came a variety of people and Avadi gastronomic style. If you want to taste fine biryani, Chaps and kebabs, this is the place. The flavor is mild and distinctively Kolkatan in contrast to much sharper styles of biryani consumed in Hyderabad.The prices are moderate. Good for family dining.

As kids my brother and i used to save our pocket money only to visit Shiraz and hog on the biryani and chaap served here. Shiraz was almost a synonym for biryani then... Calcuttans learnt to eat biryani in Shiraz. This place is part of any Calcuttan irrespective of their religion and caste. You would find all and sundry coming under the same roof to savour the taste of delicious mughla food served here. i love the Tandoori rotis and naans served here.

Biryani for me has always meant shiraz... I did give a fair chance to the other restaurants,tasted all their biryani,but none could even come close....i keep coming back to shiraz...their biryani is out of the world..not too oily,non spicy,no overt smell of rose water,and the best part...the soft yummy potato-that cant be matched by any other shop... im sure they have some secret recipe ...the amount is more than enough for one person and you actually dont need anything to go along with it...still,greed always gets the better of me..for sides,i always side with my staple chicken chaap or rezala...both these two are oily but incredibly tasty...if you arenota biryani person,you can always opt for their lachha paratha-crispy and filling...
Food,i concede,is very heavy and filling...but you absolutely must keep some space aside for the dessert...Firni- it is the icing on the cake...a perfect ending.....and i assure you,once youve tasted it,you will never relish firni anywhere else...its top notch..
Shiraz is a very famed age old establishment...but it has stood the test of time...the current restaurant is a renovated version of the original resto that stood on the opposite side of the road..this one is more suited for family dining...the decor is minimalistic...go there only for the food... prices are reasonable...another great thing is they have an eye for hygiene..iv never had to return any of their dishes which is saying a lot (because at many of the other major biryani houses iv had a major hygiene issue...i would rather not go into the details)...
All in all..despite all the competition cropping up, shiraz is still the "golden" restaurant!!
Cheers!!

And the firni for desert would be the apt choice to end the meal with ....

In the early 2000s, this place is used to be thronged by half the population of Calcutta, enamored by its authentic style of Biryani preparation. The place used to buzz with full of life. However, as is the wont in the city, with new biryani outlets blooming in its vicinity, the place lost its touch a bit. Notwithstanding, it had already earned such a lot of fame for itself that, even today, the first name that issues from the rookie foodies whenever they have to savor biryani in Calcutta is the name of Shiraz Golden Restaurant in Park Street area. It’s been a long time I have graced this place with my visit. The last time I did so, I wasn't disappointed (in fact, I was never!). The staffs were still amiable in their demeanor and approach, and they, as usual, didn’t appear boorish to anyone. It still had the perfect atmosphere, ideal for such a reputed restaurant. I truly wish that it continues to serve Calcutta’s biryani lovers the same quality of biryani in the future as it has always done so far.

Shiraz --- This is one of the old restaurant in kolkata. I think this Park street outlet is best. 

Food quality is very good but still NOT the best in kolkata in this cuisine category. We visited this restaurant on 20th July and actually we were looking for the Halim. We only get this HALIM during ramzan but unfortunately we were late and we did not get it. You need to go within 5 p.m during Ramzan to get it

We ordered

Boti Kebab (Mutton)  ----   Very Good
Reshmi Kabab (Mutton) ----  Good
Tandoori Roti  ---- Very Good
Mutton Rezala --- Average

Boti kabab was AWESOME but I expected more moist texture from the Reshmi kebab. It was a bit dry but still good ..I love their Tandoori roti it is very soft but I am DISAPPOINTED with the Mutton Rezala. The gravy was tasty and the mutton was also very tender but it looks like that mutton was boiled separately and not with gravy therefore you will feel that the taste of the gravy is not inside the mutton piece. 

This is a basic mistake which I did not expect from Shiraz. AMBIANCE was good . You can not expect fine dinning restaurant like atmosphere there ,but it is way better than the other old restaurants of this category. Service was prompt. Overall it was satisfactory.

The Description: At the Mullickbazar crossing.... Shiraz the Golden Restaurant have many hearts won with its delicious food. 

The Ambience: Ambiance is very good and quite big. Long sitting arrangements with Complete A.c. The ground floor is quite big but the upper tier consist of Sofa sitting for luxury sitting. The interior looks very good so the atmosphere. The staffs are very polite and very eager looking to serve the customers. 

The Food: Shiraz is all known for its good Food... We went for a birthday treat here of my oldest friend. We started with Biriyani which is a must try here and was as expected  very tasty. The quantity was decent and the potato was soft and the chicken in the biriyani was also alright . Secondly we had Kadai Chicken which was a disastrous choice. Thou it was tasty but the quantity really let me down. Rumali roti was soft as usual. The mutton chaap and rezala is also very good here but unable to taste it.

The Conclusion: Shiraaz has lots of franchise all over kolkata but this place leads it. You can also see Daawat-e-Shiraz the bigger one mainly for big parties and luxurious events. The golden resto thou have decent and reasonable prices of the dishes.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place,.

Clearly the BEST SHIRAZ outlet ! 

Location : Mallick Bazaar , Just after the Cemetary

Ambiance : Cream coloured sofas and ambient Blue and Yellow lights gives this joint a very nice appeal. The A.C is turned up high and provides ample comfort.

Service : Waiters in Black suits scream out opulence. Very polite and quick to take down orders and speak in a low tone. The food barely took 10 minutes , quite impressive .

Food : Mughlai cuisine has always been the domain of Shiraz , but the the various outlets have contributed  in diminishing it's name with their average amounts ! Although this being the original one , the food quality was spot on. Ordered the "MUTTON BIRIYANI" ,"RESHMI KEBAB" , "TANDOORI ROTI","CHICKEN CHAAP" . The Biriyani was good ,a  fat piece of Mutton ,a small Potato and ample Rice (in fact too much Rice ) ! Their Chicken Chaap was probably the best that I've ever eaten , very juicy together with the roti was Delightfully satisfying. The Reshmi Kebab was nice and came with a mint chutney and a salad and was cooked to perfection in the Tandoor ! Creamy on the Inside and Crispy on the outside.

Cost for 2 : 600/- (Estimate) 

Final Conclusion : A great experience with ample amounts of food. Neither too costly nor cheap. Soothing to the senses and very aromatic. A must visit.

Shiraz Golden Restaurant - Oldest yet not the best Mughlai Restaurants In Kolkata. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Intro:
As i was going to Sealdah side from the mallik bazaar, i discovered this restaurant at one of the crossing after Rahmania. As my brother was hungry and wanted to eat some food, i decided to order from here.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Food Ordered:

1) Chicken Bharta - It had lot of oil in it just as the same mughlai food. I personally found it eatable. *people who are too hygienic avoid*
2) Roomali Roti - I had better than this. Yet, it was moderately fine but rubbery. 
<><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Summary:

Food quality 3.5/5
Food quantity 3.5/5
Value for money 3/5
Taste 3.5/5

Conclusion:

I would like to visit the dining section and thereafter would like to comment on the ambience of this place. However, i have seen this place running from quite a long time but with as far as i heard from my other foodie friends, this place has indeed degraded with time. :)

this review is a little late considering that I have visited shiraz quite a few times and have tasted a wide variety of their chicken / mutton dishes and their signature biriyani !!!   but then shiraz DOESNT REALLY NEED a review or introduction to any "Calcuttan".  shiraz now has about 5-6 restaurants all around Calcutta but this is the flagship outlet and I personally haven't tried any other of their outlets.

I personally call shiraz the top of the biriyani triangle in Calcutta (shiraz, arsalan and zeeshan constitute the triangle, btw).

Biriyani -- the shiraz brand of biriyani is light (not too oily and heavy i.e.) and yummy and belongs to the Awadhi / Lucknavi style - with the "Calcutta customization" of course - which is my personal favourite.  

of the chicken / mutton side dishes, the usual populars are always the "chaap" and "rezaala" because they are usually "safe" and can rarely go wrong!! chicken bharta is another favourite with most - it is shredded chicken in thick mughlai style gravy with half an egg.  I have tasted most of the side dishes here and these are the safest that cant go wrong with most.

of the kebabs, the haryali and tikka (spicy) kebabs win my vote.

writing this review, I am already raring to get back to Calcutta during the upcoming durga puja and dig into another round of biriyani and bharta!!

Had nan, mutton rezala, shahi stew and shahi tukda. The dishes were just amazing, the curries are so light and delightful to one's tastebuds, and the nan soft and fluffy. This was an Sunday evening escapade so the little amounts of each dish which we had left us very satisfied. And then came the shahi tukda, if till now we were feeling we spent an evening of worth, this desert just blew our minds. How can a bread be made so tasty and kheer be so light, just gobbled it down as fast as possible. Now the service, one of the most friendly i have ever seen, our waiter understood that we had come for gastronomic pleasure and ensured we did. So we left with a smile in our face and licking our fingers

been going to this place since i dont even remember...i must share that my school bus used to pass in front of shiraz early morning near about 6.45 am and trust me i still remember all of us used  get the aroma of their biriyani and get tantalized ...their quality of biriyani remains the same today...obv one of the best in the city....order  in starters tandoori or reshmi kabab then chicken/mutton biriyani and one chanp / quorma and u will be done....service - not so great and you should not expect as well...u might not find it so clean or fancy as well...expenses - a definite paisa wasool ...so what more anyone can crib for....

this place doesn't need any further introduction/ review to a real foodie in Kolkata. this could be a small tribute to them. I've been here and regular since childhood. Nothing had changed actually, they had just shifted to another place in the same vicinity and leased out previous property after rebuilding a private hotel which has a restaurant named 'dawat e shiraz', serving buffet too. The Golden Shiraz has remained the same as it was like an institution on it's own.

I have been visiting this restaurant since childhood and everytime I visit this joint ,the two items I order are Mutton Pasinda which is small boneless pieces of mutton served in a very thick and spicy gravy in a small plate i guess the size of a tea dish and I think it is the best moughlai dish you could have ever had with its taste tingling in your mouth even after you are back home and will make you crave for visiting again and again....the other item is their mutton biryani which is very light, not oily like other restaurant's and has a lot of black pepper in it which gives it a taste different from all other biriyani joints..

I had fond memories of the shahi kulcha I ate at this place that I keep going back to it. But with time the biryani has become average, the shahi kulcha very middle class and what shocked me most was an incident last week. I wanted a mutton dish, the waiter just named two so I selected Mutton Quorma which costed 140. What I got was a below 50 gm piece of mutton flooded in some yellow gravy with one boiled egg. I called a waiter just to verify it wasn't a mistake, and he said no its not and generally they advise not to take that dish (nobody advised me), and to justify the price, said that's why they do us a huge favour by putting an egg! Fine I swallowed my money and went to the cashier to pay with card. Two waiters surrounded me from both sides and were constantly staring at my pin entry, and as I was walking out disgusted of all this, they even had the audacity to say "That's it?" (these were not even the people who had served me)

Ask many of them! And they will yell Biryani!

Ask me! And I will not yell! 

I would rather slowly speak out that Golden Shiraz has lot more to offer.  You could think about chicken tangri kabab, pomfret tandoori kabab, chicken bharta alongside mutton liver fry and many more! I would especially yell about this mutton liver fry, a spicy and definitely mouth warming dish that tastes like heaven if you try with the tandoori roti. Chicken tangri kabak would also sooth your tongue with the deliciousness of being properly woven.

Honestly, I am not much bothered about the ambiance and atmosphere inside it. It is good, definitely not great. And it is good for your wallet! Rather your wallet will love it after you complete the scrumptious meal for an affordable rate.

Summary :  The place to go for an impeccable Awadhi biriyani. 

Details :  This place is a Calcutta institution. It has a no nonsense menu,  with a simple selection of kabaabs that pair well with the rotis, naans and kulchas,  mains of  quorma, chaap, rezala, pasinda, and kassa of both mutton and chicken, the flagship biriyani, with a firni or shahi tukra for dessert.  The  mains carry a stamp of authentic Lucknow origin : the quorma, rezala, pasinda and kassa are really what they ought to be, not the indistinguishable reddish brown gravies served in most "Mughlai" restaurants elsewhere. The biriyani remains one of its kind. Delicately flavoured and light, it is the perfect accompaniment to one of the mains. The service can be brusque, but the waiters do recognise regulars and manage to extend some courtesy through their overwork.  This is not a restaurant that scores on ambience or service but is one that is hard to beat when it comes to Awadh inspired cuisine. This reviewer, having frequented the restaurant for approximately thirty years, cannot agree with other reviews that claim a deterioration in quality.

It was the good old days of Shiraz and also for the people of Kolkata that whenever any discussion about quality biriyani was talked about Shiraz would always be preferred than the other players. And Shiraz would do justice in serving good Mughlai cuisine to the fellow people. But of late after having opened a large number of eateries all around the city their quality has tremendously fallen over the years. 
Thus I had wanted to pay a visit along with my few friends to this new place. The decor is decent and the overall ambiance is nothing great to talk about except some flashy lights spread over the dining area. We had ordered tandoori fish for starters and mutton biriyani and brain masala for the main course. To my utter disappointment I literally had no idea the quality can drop so drastically. The tandoori fish was total rubbish. It was not bhetki at all and the fish was stiff and dry. Fish kebabs are always soft which in this place it was. But it was not at all juicy and tasty might be because of the quality of the fish. Mutton biriyani is decent and nothing much great to talk about. Yes it was tasty but there are other players serving better biriyanis. The brain masala was good. It was soft and portion was also decent. The shahi tukra and the firni which was ordered as desserts were average. 
Again this place is serving good food but I am rating it as average because other restaurants are serving quality cuisine at affordable prices which are bench-marked. Thus in comparison with the other places the place is not at par.The prices are also not reasonable considering the quality they serve.Hope they might revive their quality in near future.

Shiraz has always been unanimous with biryani in Calcutta. Much before the days of Arsalan and other restaurants, Shiraz was the place to go for lip smacking biryani and chicken chaap. I have spent many evenings sitting in the rooftop garden, enjoying the sumptuous biryani, and watching the traffic go by. Though the rooftop garden does not remain anymore, Shiraz still occupies a place in my heart.
Shiraz has always been known for biryani, but I urge others, who have not been here and swear by the biryani of other restaurants, just pay this place a visit and you will not be disqappointed. The dishes that I would surely recommend are Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chaap, Mutton Rezala, Chicken do Pyaza, Chicken Bharta and Chicken Kassa. Each of these dishes come cooked in a pool of lard, but when the food tastes so good, who bothers with the calories? A meal can surely never be complete without their firni, which is like a porridge, made with milk, rice and mawa. It is flavoured with rose water which gives a very pleasant after-taste. Shiraz is surely recommended for each and every biryani lover in Calcutta.
PS- Tea is present on the menu, however, one cannot order only tea. Some food dishes have to be ordered and the tea can accompany the order.

Birayani time- shiraj time. From chilhood heard this, and i can bet that the saying is argubably true. Amazing aroma and taste makes it perfect meal. Their birayi is so famous that even Makbul fida hussin was a die hard fan of the taste. The same style and taste is continuing to please the food loving community from 1970 onwards. They have many branches also and all the branches tastes same.

Shiraz is one of the older mughlai restaurants in the city and is quite famous for its biryani. In its heydays it served awesome biryani and even today though not as fantastic they serve one of the better biryani's around. What is not too consistent is the quality and size of the mutton portion served in their mutton biryani ... at times its soft and well prepared at others its stringy and dry. My usual order would be the mutton burra kabab , chicken chaap and mutton biryani washed down with a firni. Also their tikia kebab and tandoori / roomali roti is a pretty nice combination.

If you are in search of good Mughlai food at a reasonable price-Shiraz is the place you are looking for.

FOOD: Try the kebabs....would recommend -mutton reshmi kebab and chiken amritsari kebab- very tasty and extremely soft. It is one of the best places to have biriyani....though i didn't like the gravy mutton which was ordered with the biriyani....the dry kebabs are much better. 
Desert- Firni....no second thoughts about it...it is awesome. Tried the shahi tukra once- Didnt like it....it is just a piece of bread covered with kheer most probably.

AMBIENCE: Very basic and average. 

SERVICE: this is something which they need to improve. Though the food is served very quickly but the waiters are not prompt enough. water is not served properly, you have to ask for spoons, forks etc time and again.

PRICE: Reasonable.


Wud definately recommend kolkatans to try it out for sure if you havent!

Before beginning, I have to say, I am slightly biased towards Shiraz. That said, giving this place ratings which is just about okay might sound harsh. However, it is necessary. 

The last two times I went to the Park st outlet, I was taken to my seat immediately. One time, I got the mutton biryani with the mutton pasinda. I have a thing for the pasinda here and it did not disappoint at all. However, the mutton in the biryani was dry and tasteless. For a brand which constantly is promoting itself as the "Authentic Kolkata Biryani", that is unacceptable in my book. I checked my companion's piece of meat as well, and his turned out to be dry too. And decidedly chewy.

The pasinda was great though. Slightly bony, but great. It was what I would curl up with along with a couple of tandoori rotis.

I thought... okay, this is just one incident, and maybe the next time I go it would be changed.

Next time I went there, I was in a group of four. We ordered a biryani, two chaaps, a pasinda, two burra kababs and one chicken tandoori along with naan. The biryani, again, was good, but the meat was super-dry. Now I was annoyed. The burra kabab, although quite nice, was way more burned than I would have liked, rendering it quite bitter. Chaap was okay, but nothing to write home about. In fact, my friend thought it was too salty. 

Service was fast, but also very abrupt. Our water glasses were banged down in front of us. It is not acceptable when the prices are not average.

I have never particularly liked the food here, but visited a few days back as I was in the area. Found the new ac restaurant and walked in. Got a place near the door which was busy. Since the restaurant was quite full, the steward soon seated someone else on my table, without even bothering to ask me first.

As was expected the restaurant was reasonably clean, and noisy but not disturbing. I wanted a mutton do-piaza, but it was not available. The steward suggested the chicken dopiaza, said it was the special for the day (was not mention on the board though). Food was served pretty quick, but it was disappointing. It was nowhere close to a dopiaza. Was stew like gravy, with pieces of chicken (one small breast and one with the wings). The gravy also contained one small whole onion and a slice of carrot! Dopiaza? When I pointed it out the steward very helpfully informed me that different restaurants have their individual styles! Yeah sure.

The rotis were not good. I notice a distinctive smell that I find annoying. I guess I prefer the Punjabi style tandoori rotis. I had asked for a Thumsup, which at first they said they were out of, but then a waiter was despatched to get some from the adjacent shop. The Thumsup turned out to be the star of the meal. Nice and chilled!

Also tried a shahi tukra, but was not particularly impressed. It was served with some cake-like crumbs on top. The best shahi tukdas I have had have been at Chhote Nawab and at Royal!

Have been visited there only once. They have modified there ambience and it is very clean and nice decorated. Food quality is appetizing and mouthwatering. Service is a okay and need to be improved. Pricing is reasonable. The biriyani is tasty and the kebabs are yummy too. When i went there, i consumed tandoori roti which was very stiff but the other foods tasted well. Sitting arrangement is good and that place is filled with the aroma of typical mughlai food. Food quantity is immense and they take a lot of time to prepare food, especially biriyani. The chicken chaap is also delectable and roomali roti, my favourite type of roti was great too. Its completely air-conditioned. i would rate 3 stars for 'SHIRAZ GOLDEN RESTAURANT'

YUMMRAJ Demystifies the Legend of Shiraz

In a nutshell:

A long History of excellence, sadly struggling to keep up with its earlier Glory - A lunch here left us with a cold feeling & also food that was surely lower than expectations.

Short Description - In case u r in a hurry:

Shiraz as a name rings a bell with Most Calcuttans (since the Days when Kolkata was Calcutta). I have had many good experiences in the past here like many others. Over the years I have seen a decline & had stopped going here & insead to the newly opened Arsalan. Similar experiences cud b heard from others as well. This time around I made it a point to revisit Shiraz & check it out myself................ 

There are two restaurants at Park Street Mullickbazar area. One is a few shops away from the other. The newer one is closer to the crossing & the older one is a few shops away. The newer one is swankier as well. We decided to go to the Old one.

The old restaurant has a non airconditioned ground floor & an airconditioned first floor. Furniture, look & ambience of the first floor is much upgraded as compared to the ground floor. The look at first floor was that of an old Eightees restaurant. Cubicles made with set of sofas facing each other. Lighting was dim.

The staff of this place need a special mention. Some of them seem to walk out of a 70's movie. They have been in the same job of waiting tables for decades, have got bored enough & that shows on their face every moment, appear at the tables like robots without any facial expression & at times frown if too many questions are asked. The uniform has quite a 'Nawabi Khansama' look. The relatively younger Manager who I guess was the only person in suit, was also quite serious faced. He was continuing to speak to me in English even though I was speaking in Bengali. It was then that I did what I do best - mentally poke. I striked a conversation on 'what is popular here / what is legendary here, I have come from far to eat here/ what is 'mash-hoor' (famous) here etc & within 3 -4 sentences each, the customer - server barrier fell apart. We were talking to each other as two human beings & the interaction was excellent since then for the rest of our stay.

The food is surely very good in isolation but as compared to others, this one takes a beating - Straight away from Arsalan Park Circus & surely from Aafreen, Metiabruz. We were unlucky to get stale meat in one of the dishes, very happy to get a replacement after we reported the same & even more disappointed when the replacement turned out to b stale as well.
 
Detailed Description - In case u have the time to njoy reading:

We started our Lunch with a starter recommended by our server - Mutton Burrah Kabab. He said 'This is the best among all starters on offer'. We were served 2 pieces of the Burrah kabab, one of which turned out to be stale meat (first bite was horrifying). The other one was absolutely fine. It seems they were from two different goats.  We complained about the meat & we were offered a replacement of both the kababs. We said 'just replacing the bad one is good enough'. We were told that since Burrah takes 20 minutes to make, it wud take 20 minutes & it wud b good if we ate the biryani before the burrah. So did we.

The burrah was perfectly spiced, excellent to taste but had a serious problem with texture. The pieces of the burrah that were hanging loose / the pieces towards the outside of the burrah was perfect. However the meat adjacent to the bone (1.5 cm from the bone) was raw & red (like in steaks that are rare). I personally did not dislike it coz to me it was like a steak with Indian spices but I am sure most people will not b able to appreciate it. Taste wise this get 4.5/5 & texture wise it gets 2.5/5. Overall the good Burrah gets 3.5/5. 

The replacement burrah was much better than the stale one but was just about 70% fresh. That was surprising & I have a problem with it - Once is an accident but second time is callousness (I heard the server tell the kitchen that this was a replacement). Stale one gets 0/5 & that takes the plate of Burrah to 1.75/5.

Shiraz serves Kolkata Biryani - for the uninitiated, Kolkata Biryani is an offshoot of Lucknowi Dum Biryani that was introduced to the population of Kolkattans when Nawab of Lucknow Wazid Ali Shah was deported from Lucknow to Kolkata by the British. The nawab brought with him his huge entourage of chefs & nauch girls. The chefs left a lasting impression on Bengali cuisine - Kolkata Biryani, Chhamp, rezala, korma etc are an integral part of Bengali cuisine now. 

Like the Lucknowi Biryani, the Kolkata Biryani is also slow cooked under low fire by sealing the container (Dum cooking) & the meat & rice is cooked together so that the flavors of the meat & the rice intermingle. The Biryani is characterized by flavorful long independent grains of rice that are super-soft melt in the mouth & meats that r super soft & least fibrous (due to long period of cooking). A whole potato & a boiled egg is also customarily served. There is hardly any salan served anywhere with Kolkata Biryani.

We ordered the Shiraz Special Mutton Biryani. The rice was long but not extra long. The grains of rice were independent but not super-soft 'melt in the mouth'. The flavors & taste was however very good. I wud give this 3.5/5.

The meats were not at all super soft. They were not as hard as well. They were just about ok - If I were served this food at some outlet in Gurgaon, I wud have maybe accepted it. However, sitting at Shiraz in Kolkata, this was far below expectations. Good in terms of taste & flavors again. I wud say the meat gets 3.5/5.

Overall the Biryani thus gets 3.5/5

We ordered two side dishes with the Biryani. One was a Chaap that has been famous for decades. Chaap is mutton rib marinated in masalas & tawa cooked over a long time. The pieces were not presented like usual mutton chops but as abruptly chopped mutton rib pieces. That made the eating part quite weird - difficult to make out which is the meat & which is the bone. Taste wise it was very good & so were the flavors. I wud give this 3.75/5.

We also went for Mutton stew. This is not at all linked to the European Mutton stew - infact they wud faint on seeing this stew. This is a mutton curry with loads of ghee, spices & an oniony base. The taste of the gravy is awesome & so r the flavors. Some Mutton pieces were very soft & nice. Others were pretty fibrous. I wud do a 4.5/5 for the gravy & a 3/5 for the meats. That makes the overall 3.75/5.

We ended the meal with Phirni - the photo of the phirni on menu card showed strands of saffron. The phirni served to us had not even one strand. The taste was very flat & quite boring. To finish it was becoming a challenge. I wud give this 2/5.

Thus taking into consideration all individual dishes, the overall score comes to 3/5. 

The newer Shiraz Golden restaurants in the other parts of the world seem to be doing good but the old original one is in a state of neglect. I hope someone from the Management reads this & does the needful.

their biriyani once the best in kolkata , maybe not the worst but is now rather not so good anymore. the decor and the stuffs are alright. but their food is not that good anymore. preparations of kebabs are not bad also but not the best anymore i'd say. the place has two sections. one for normal non A/C meal and the other for A/C meal. But instead of all the nostalgia and efforts the place doesn't stand very well in today's scenario.

The ambiance was good, the quality of food was good too though the servicing was very poor.
I orderd Tandoori chicken ,Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Kassa and Firni. Tandoori Chicken is worth a mention, the Biriyani was good, on the less spicy side but could've been better. The Mutton Kassa was the worst! 
You must avoid this dish as it was too oily and the Mutton was not properly cooked. The funniest part was that we ordered the Firni but weren't served and were given the bill. 
I would've given a poor rating but would give more because of the Tandoori Chicken.
