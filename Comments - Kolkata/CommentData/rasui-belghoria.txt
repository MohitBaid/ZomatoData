I ordered food last night and it was delivered right on time. Prawn Gold Rings are a must try and tastes delicious. Should try out a few more delicacies soon. Highly recommended !

Ordered for home delivery, the service was fast, and upto the mark. The quantity of one plate of noodles was enough for me alone and the quality is what You expect at a place like Belghoria. Overall, satisfied totally

I am a regular customer of this restaurant. Yesterday I ordered for biriyani n it was pathetic. There was no taste, flavour of biriyani. Very disappointing. U will get much more better quality in belghoria at same price.

Bad service, I didn't receive the order in time & suffered a lot for their inconvenience.....Unexpected response from their side & feeling disgusted with the service......I would have rated zero to their service if there is that chance of rating zero......For the frst time I experienced such a disgusted attitude from their side......Think thrice before ordering from this restaurant specially when you are ordering for your guests ...... For your information, they don't give value to customers who give minimum order as simple as that ......

I am intended to update my seven months back review. Don't know whether the management or ownership got changed, received extremely poor service from this restaurant with degraded quality.
The response time for delivery increased to 1.5 hours and delay in delivery become normal now a days. Also the owner behaved in a extreme rude manner when asked about the delay. Simply he told to not to order anymore from the restaurant and provide bad feedback as he seems don't care about it. Also the owner simply lying by saying the delivery person tried to call me and unable to reach me, whereas previously I have received N number of order from them and they know my home very well. Seems old trick copied from domino...
Seriously get shocked by such behaviour as it was one of my frequently ordered restaurant. Time to update my restaurant list.....

Old review (7 months back)

I am a frequent customer of this restaurant. Ordering food for last three years, before its in Zomato. They serve very tasty food. I frequently order home delivery. Also they have good amount of options in Indian and Chinese cuisine. Thanks to zomato for various discount.
