This was one of my preferred places a long time back, but recently the place has turned to ruins due less to no management. The conditions' so bad that one of the air conditioners often tends to malfunction and you can even literally see rats running across the floor. 
Still, giving a 2.5 since these can easily be fixed if they wanted to and the food's quality within a reasonable budget, hasn't degraded much over the years.
If you ever visit this place, avoid Biryani since they taste pretty meh , try their Chinese or Rumali Rotis instead.
Overall, this is not recommendation unless you can ignore the huge number of issues this place has as of now. You can easily find better restaurants in the locality.

Pathetic !!! Be it the food quality or the service provided by the staff, even a roadside eatery is far better than this place.
Once, I ordered a plate of chicken biryani, it was stale in the first place & I managed to fish out 2 streaks of hair !!!! When I complained the same to the person, he took the plate of biryani away & after 40 mins he said that he can give me any chinese dishes apart from biryani.

This place is located at the edge of Taltala ground and can be easily located. They serve good food both in terms of quality and quantity. The place upstair is good to relax as generally they don't have much rush. The ambience is not so cool and they can make it more clean.

It's a small food joint,definitely not a visual treat but the food served here is very pocket-friendly and good.The service is also pretty quick.
I really liked the chicken chap.The gravy was delectable.The chicken korma was pretty okay, nothing great.Both the dishes had good number of chicken pieces.

Overall,it's a good option for a low budget take away meal.

This small restaurant is near Eedf Taltala ground. Easily located from road. 
Staffs are sober and service is prompt. 
Pocket pinch is cheap. 
Quantity is well enough. 
Don't go with it's look.. It's just few sitting arrangements in the upstairs and takeaway food joint. 
I went there with friends and tried 
Chicken Bharta 
Mixed Chow 
Tandoori Roti 
All of them tastes good. Mixed Chow had enough of chicken eggs etc. Tastes good. Good to go with friends. Recommendable ❤

A shabby little restaurant located beside the EDF Maath in Prince Anwar Shah, this place is a real hidden gem for me. This place always is never full, be it during the Durga Pujas when you have to wait for atleast half an hour in all moderate restaurants. The food comes at an affordable cost and tastes really well. A real stomach saver during the pujas!

Nothing really special about this place. it was quite close to my tuition. So I've been here a couple of times. The rolls are okayish, nothing to brag about. Have tried their Biryani once or twice I guess. Was not really satisfied with the quality. This was once a Bedwin, but it has been many years since it has lost the brand name as well as the quality.

Hi Hat property was previous owned by Bedwin chain,not sure how owns it now.

#Location: Beside EEDF also called Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra on Prince Anwarshah Road(close to South City).

#Service: okish

#Ambiance: Its a two story restaurant with take away and kitchen on the ground floor and a small sitting area on the top floor.

#Food:Had roll and picked up some biryani. The roll was oily and the oil to wad bad. The biyani was also not up to the mark.

A shabby place with horrible snacks. Had rolls a couple of times, which had okayish portions of chicken, but was too oily to complete it totally. The kitchen as is visible from outside is unhygienic too ! The person who takes the cash is also too serious to frighten the guests. :) Would certainly not recommend !

I remember coming here with mom and dad once only very long ago. The place was shabby, it is still very shabby as it looks from outside. We had ordered Biryani and Chilli Chicken, weird combination but I used to love that as a child. Whatever it is, I recollect of finding hair in the food. The food wasn't good at all.

I never used the dining here. I used the fast-food counter. The speciality of the food of this outlet is excessive use of potatoes. If you are eating an Egg-Roll, you will be exhausted by eating those potatoes. So be aware of potatoes around here.

Chinese food outlet, with menu as bad as decision of going out on a hot, summer afternoon. Food quality is not upto the mark. Quantity may be the only thing that is okay with this place. But that does not matter, because the food you order for home delivery will arrive hours later, killing your hunger. Not a place to go for dining OR home delivery.

If the word PATHETIC have some synonyms in a foodie's dictionary, then "HI HAT RESTAURANT" will be one of those.
Even on busy weekdays, you may find yourself the only person inside this restaurant having your food. You'll be delighted to see a variety of items in the menu card, but all your delight will sublime like a piece of camphor, when you'll get to know that almost more than half of the items are unavailable. The ambience inside is absolutely average, with two non functioning AC machines kept just for show. And yes, they don't even bother to clean the floor on a regular basis, and as a result of which I had witnessed cockroach roaming in the floor of this place!! So if the floor of the eating area is like this, I really doubt how hygienic the cooking premises can be.
Service is so-so, and so far the quality of food is concerned, its SUBSTANDARD. Even the street side food stalls serve better food than this place.
And to my surprise, why the hell GARLIC CHICKEN should taste unnecessarily sweet??!! Moreover, the chicken chunks were literally stiff in texture.
And yes, I had a stomach upset after having their food.
So if you want to waste your money on substandard food, and looking forward to have a stomach upset next day....
Welcome To "HI HAT RESTAURANT"

Kebabs were fine. Other foods are not that great, but ok to have. If you are sitting on the ground with your friends in front of HiHat for a couple of hours, and feeling hungry may be...the why not? I remember before the renovation the old one was in the groud floor, it was more like a food joint. now they have two stored. Never crowded. And may be you will be having a feeling that they do not care that it is not crowded phew !!

I have been visiting this place right from those days when it was a one floor food joint with no ac. While the place started developing itself as a restaurant, the food quality started deteriorating. 

Presently, it is a very small restaurant with VERY rude staff. If you are eating a meal on the first floor, try and sit right beside the window. It gives me a feel of a European hut! The ac hardly ever works and you might have to ask the owner to switch it on a couple of times before he actually does it. The food, starting from noodles to rice to chicken will have extra oil! I have never really tasted the Biriyani from here.

The only thing that I like about the place is its chicken rolls. Egg and paneer rolls are hell again. But the chicken rolls are actually nicely made. Payment has to be made at the cash counter and you will have to wait outside for the super slow service to deliver your roll. If you are lucky, they would even remember your chilli and sauce specifications. 

Not a fan of this place but I have visited it various occasions because some of my friends like the pocket friendly prices here. Try the rolls here. Rest, try and decide for yourself.

This place is located beside the EEDF ground, Prince Anwer Shah Road. It was on a Saturday afternoon, we visited this place to satisfy our hunger-bitten tummy. We went for plain egg rice and spicy schezwan  chicken.  The taste of the Egg rice was not bad  and it is sufficient for one people and Schezwan chicken was mediocre but we got a bit surprised when we  had found out   sliced red pepper in Chinese gravy.
 The ambiance of the place is on the average side and their air condition is of poor condition.  The place looks very unorganized as far as its maintenance of the ambiance is concerned.  This place is not expensive,  that is why it is not going to burn a hole in your pocket. We two people had two plates of egg rice and one schezwan chicken and paid 270 without tax.  It is a very mediocre experience over there.

I completely rely on HiHat Dhaba to feed any sudden or sometimes planned guests who visit my home. Our usual home delivery menu has chicken fried rice, veg hakka noodles, veg Manchurian balls dry, (which are very yummy) and a garlic chicken or Manchurian chicken gravy. The average spend is about 250-300 for all these items, the reason why we are repeat customers. The other items which are really tasty are baby corn/mushroom Manchurian dry which is a great starter, always order 2 as the portion is not very big. Their soups are also good. worth trying anyday!!
