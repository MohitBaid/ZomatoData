A good place, although‚Äã the location is a bit odd. But good service. And cheap prices. Cool hangout place for friends. Nice and simple decor, a cute place. But the place was nearly empty, I would blame it on the location though.

This is a Shady lounge inside The Mystery Room. The place is Under-Decorated. Good hookah is served here. Quality of food is average. They offer a lot of combos. Staff are not trained properly

Not a nice visit to the outlet, food is below average shisha choked on many occasions, interiors aren't bad service can be little quick, servers need to be attentive and take orders properly.
