Ordered a home delivery of house and house pizza and the chef's special pizza, both large.
Delivery took about 45 minutes, which is definitely not on the quick side.
The size and the toppings are generous, and the pizza crust is thin. However, only complain is that the crust was pretty hard and some parts were really not chewable. The pizza apart from that was really tasty and good.

I've ordered it from swiggy after my friend recommended it. 
We ordered a bbq Chicken bruschetta and A house pizza.
The bruschetta was kinda made well but had a continental touch. 
The pizza was really good.
And I'm giving a 3.5 bcz they didn't provide sauce or oregano.  üòí in my delivery.

I honestly fell in love with this place, its very cozy small comfy kind of a joint. Very easy to locate near Chinar park. After a lot of zomato research we found this out. This time we went vegan and surprisingly they have a good range of vegetarian food unlike other places. We ordered pepper corn soup, mixed veg exotic pizza and margarita. Soup was perfect to the T. Full of sweet corns , bursting out flavours. It was spicy with black pepper. Flavours and taste was perfectly balanced. Coming to the pizza, I didn‚Äôt like it that much. Very less veggies, as they promised on the menu for zucchini mushrooms and other veggies, I didn‚Äôt find none. It only had capsicum, bell peppers and corns and cheese. I thought chilli flakes will make it a little better but they didn‚Äôt have it. Only tomato sauce and mixed herbs. It didn‚Äôt work out for me. However margarita was perfect, it was tangy, sweet and lemony. Loved it. This place is pocket friendly also, will surely pay another visit.

Very small and cozy,good ambience..food is good.Ordered Pizza and noodles which was good but pizza crust was little hard, could  have been softer.The staff said if we mention soft base then we can get one.location is very near to Chinar park. Some of the menu items were missing..great hospitality.Would definately visit again.

Great location. Outstanding hospitality by the young passionate team there. Tried the Noodle soup which was a perfect starter. Crispy 12 inches Pizza with exotic veggies and melt in the moth mozzarella. Followed by yummy Indian Curry. Oriental, Italian and Indian in same outlet; isnt it a real steal of a deal. All of it comes in with superb value for money too and very economical prices. Anil you have a way to go and i can see Bahamas becoming a special brand soon in Cal....

well.. there is no food photos. i forgot to take snaps. the reason behind this is the food.. thay was so tasty that i couldn't stop eating..
the main attraction of this little restaurant is its architectural conception... the illumination.. the decor.... and of course the presentation... affordable carte.. so many belly-timbers to choose from.. 
but the what i loved the most was the music... i must admire the person who made that playlist.. 
wishing to visit this place more often.. price is a little high for me.. but they worth that..

It was my random choice of visiting this place. I went there with couple of my friends.  This place located on the main road. Very fancy restaurant with decent pricing.
The quality of the food is definitely worth trying again.
Place is well maintained with highly energetic staff and management 
Options of all type of food and special of the days kept me busy everytime I visit this restaurant.
Their coffee options also do good
And pasta I never had such delecious pasta
Comfirteble seating and quick service 
I definitely recommend this place.

Worst food experience from the restaurant!! Nearly half bowl of oil has been extracted from the Punjabi curry ordered and got half or even less than half cooked rotis. 
If one is willing to commit suicide by food poisoning than only the food should be ordered from this restaurant.

Not suitable for living beings. Dead people can try it..

Ordered today pasta, exotic veg pizza and shezwan noodles. Got a 15% discount and additional 20% using a promo code. Its Just a couple of minutes distance from my home. 
Food was great and the price is also nominal. 
Pasta was very good. 
Noodles were tasty but quite spicy. 
Pizza was also good with thin crust base but the base could be a bit more softer.
Will surely order again !

Awesome place!! Small and cosy for perfect hang out!! Ordered 11 inches non-veg pizza with extra cheese..though they took a bit extra time to make it but the taste of the pizza was 'finger-licking good'(hope KFC dosen't have copyright on these wordsüòâ) !!!!! Have to come here again for the pizza only..the behavior of the staffs was too friendly..they even gave me a charger to charge my phone.. 


But only one thing they should improve. They don't have a washroom. Its a basic and necessary thing. So for that reason 0.5 i have deducted....


Overall experience was awesome...keep it up....

The ambience is the only cool thing about this place otherwise every other thing is awful. The staff are friendly but i cannot overlook their lack of service. They are super slow and basically have zero idea about their own menu and somehow have the guts to charge a bomb for their incompetence.
Tolerable for a cafe but nothing more. Don't try their restaurant else your disappointment will have a whole new definition.

We were in need for a cafe. Any cafe. To sit and have deep discussions (ya sometimes that happens ok) over coffee and some eatables. The friend discovered this one and we decided to go for it. Locating the cafe wasn't tough but it's not right off the main Chinar Park Crossing. Now coming to the cafe itself, it's a small one. They did put in a lot of efforts trying to make it look cool and though tiny, it does feel homely-cool. That's a plus! The staff is friendly (read smiles) but a little unaware of the menu details but I guess that's a given since it's a very very new place. Coming to the little disappointments; we ordered Cold Cappuccino which was supposed to be served with Vanilla Ice-cream. And I can safely say, there was absolutely no ice-cream and the Cappuccino was not something I would ever order there again (if I ever do). The friend ordered an Oreo Black Coffee which wasn't great either going by his expression. Next we ordered French Fries (the size of the fries and the seasoning were all wrong!) and Bruschetta BBQ Chicken and they somehow just changed the order to some Paneer Chilli Toast (no idea why!) And by that time, both of us didn't really have the patience to argue so we gave up and tried the same, which again was a sad food story. To give the cafe another fair chance, we finally ordered a plate of steamed chicken momos which were fine if you haven't tasted or craved for the authentic Tibetan succulent dimsum delights. My friend had to leave the outer coating and consume the chicken filling just like that.
The owner is a young enthusiastic guy and did come up to talk to the people which I find was very good move for a startup cafe. There's a lot of promise to this place if only it could do something, anything to streamline the menu and majorly the taste. Cause by the end of the day, people would come down looking for good food. It's all about good food! Always.
