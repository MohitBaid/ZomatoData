Ok it is really  very  difficult  to review  this place. It has many  contradicting  features. The stuffs are not that well  behaved  where as the owner is very  friendly and warm.  South  Indian food  especially  dosa is not up to the mark where  as momos, paneer  and chicken  dishes are very  good. Ambience  is not up to the mark

'Sunny's refreshment' - a pocket friendly multi-cuisine small eatery.. During my college days i used to visit here.. Quality and quantity of food are always satisfying..

Location : dis small food joint is situated just beside sonali cinema hall(dunlop).

About : decor is basic. Nothing special to talk about.. Thy have both ac and non-ac sitting arrangements .. Service is a bit slow...

Now coming to the food.. As its a multi-cuisine restaurant so thy have menu list with variety of options.. South Indian, Chinese, mughlai everything is available here..

We ordered chicken pakora, kashmiri polao, mutton korma..

¤ Chicken pakora(4/5)- 8 piece boneless chicken pakora served with sauce and salad.. Chicken pieces were soft nd juicy..Tasted good...

¤ kashmiri polao(3.5/5)- one plate of polao was more than enough for one person.. It was cooked properly mixed with cashew nuts, pineapple, raisins.. Tasted avg...

¤ Mutton korma(4/5)- four pieces of big size mutton cooked with perfect portion of spices.. Served in a small handi type bowl.. Garnished with fresh cream.. It was too tasty..

Pricing is reasonable. Dis is d place to have some fulfilling food without spending much...

Been here numerous times since my childhood.... Cozy little place. Serves Chinese Indian and South Indian food. Food is good wrt price. Momos and dahi vada is very good. But don't expect much of an ambience. Specially the  blue lights are a little irritating at times.

Awesome foods tastes finger licking. Had chicken tandoori as starter and in main course we had chicken kadai and butter nan. The chicken in tender easy to chew only the restaurant is situated in an awkward place specially during puja very hard to get a place to sit inside the restaurant peacefully. Inside the restaurant is so small that when a normal guy tries to walk his head may get banged against the top  .

Situated just beside the entrance of Sonali Cinema hall in dunlop,this is a place every person living in and around baranagar,belgharia,dunlop,etc.. has visited at any time of his/her life.A small eatery with kebabs hanging on seekhs and rumali rotis being prepared,surrounded by a mobile phone shop with vivo and oppo placards😛...yes this exactly is the scenario of sunny's from outside.
They have a normal seating arrangement for 15 people at the most..Interiors are not something which can be talked about.But the main talking point of this place is the variety of dishes they serve...WHAT do u wish to have??Just ask for it and you'll definitely find them on the menu..
From crazy kebabs to idli..dosa..sambaram..to chinese dishes to quick bites (snacks),they have it all covered..
Food quality can be termed good when compared to their prices..Their Badam Lassi is a must try..
A good place to hangout with a small bunch of friends on a tight budget..

Prepare yourself before visiting this place for a hard time. Located right beside Sonali Cinema hall Dunlop it's one of the worst ever restaurant I have ever been to. The quality of food is pathetic and services and behaviour of the staffs ohh my  god, they will treat as if they are giving you food for free.. please don't waste your hard earned money here cause once you are there you will come out with just one thing that's regret and agony.

What can i say about this restaurant! I've gone there at least 25-26 times till now. Their service sometimes get a little bad but for average the staffs are good. Now about the food. Everything single food i tasted is very good and delicious. Their special friedrice and hakka noodle is a must try. And the fried chicken is best for side dish. And their nun and tarka combo is just out of the world. Those who haven't tasted yet I'll recommend you to try at least for once

Sunny's Refreshment is another small restaurant located in the same building of old Sonali Cinema Hall, just beside the main gate. If you are tall enough, your head might touch the roof of the Ac dining on first floor. 

So a very small place is somehow managed to fit one ac & one non ac dining on the ground floor. Ambiance is very basic, simple wooden table & chairs to fit maximum people, an aquarium is the main focus & blue lights is something different. I won't say this place is very clean but somehow manageable.

We looked into their menu card, they serve Chinese, Momos, Indian, Tandoor, South Indian. Phew.. quite a number of dishes for this kind of restaurant. We shatteled with the basic options below that took quite a long for them to serve.

Chicken Hakka Chow : The noodles were thin, well mixed with thin sliced vegitables & spices. Ample amount of chicken pieces were present but it was bit oily. Quantity was good & taste wise it was below average.

Garlic Chicken : Garlic chicken was served with 8 pieces & lots of gravy. Gravy was full of food color & mixed with small cut not well cooked garlic pieces that tasted rediculas with the noodles. Chicken pieces were also wrapped with a thick layer of corn flower that was soft but wasn't tasty from inside.

Above mentioned items costs Rs. 260 in total without any vat & service tax. However none of the foods were really refreshing neither their ambience & service was up to the mark. Be it pocket friendly but I will recommend you to search for other options over in the same area.

This place happen to be a college time pocket friendly hangout. We always had Chinese food here and the taste was authentic. A very, very small restaurant in the midst of the busy market area of Dunlop. You climb a flight of narrow wooden ladder like stairs and enter the place. The waiting time is usually high but the food is really good in a amazingly low price and more importantly no tax.

Note : Menu has been revised by the management & it differs from the one in Zomato.

The Place &Location : This place is exactly in the middle of Dunlop Bazar, under Sonali Cinema Hall building. Though it is surrounded by many other food stalls infront but it still has its own presence and reputation. It gathers a good crowd as because its just below a cinema hall and provides various items in Indian, Chinese and South Indian. It is built in a small area with having two small floors, ground is non A.c with having seating capacity of 6-8 heads. Whereas the upper floor is Air conditioned and has the seating capacity of 30 heads easily. The ambiance is very nice with low blue light and clean environment but the only thing required is renovation with good lighting and proper colours on the walls.

The Food : Busy with work the whole morning and arrived to Dunlop for a haircut in the lunch time. I was aware of this restaurant but never got so much of a chance to come here. So finally i been here and tried only one dish 1. Mixed Fried Rice 

1. Mixed Fried Rice : A plate full of rice and required items in it. There wasn't any spoon when ididnt find the taste of egg, chichen and prawn in it. Along with the rice the amount of egg, chicken and prawn was awesomely filled and made with good spices. Fried rice has always a different flavour which attracts mind and nose towards it and if its filled more with the lovable ingredients then its a jackpot. I must say that the amount of quantity they give is wonderful and the quality is decent too. I found a light smoky taste in the dish but i bypassed it when i saw the amount of fillings in it. One full Mixed fried rice is enough for two persons easily. My Rating : 3.5/5

Overall Experience &Recommendation : My Ratings for this place would be

3/5 for Ambiance

3.5/5 for Service

4/5 for Cleanliness & Hygiene

3.5/5 for Reasonability

3.5/5 for Food

Its an old restaurant in Dunlop area and it serves a lot of people on daily basis. But they need few improvements in decorative section to attract more custmoers. The quality and quantity of food is good and the service is quick. But i think the revised menu is a bit over priced in comparison with other chinese makers according to the place. Overall it was a good experience.

Lookwise it needs a lot of attention.
The menu is a huge one from North to South Indian dishes to Chinese food.
We had tried chicken hot n sour soup,sunny's special hakka noodles,sunny's special fried rice and schezwan chicken.
The soup was very tasty.
The presentation of rice and noodles were excellent. Both were loaded with eggs,chicken and prawns.
But the food was extra oily.
The side dish was not that tasty.
The quantity is very good.
Enough for 3 people.
Over all it was ok-ok. Need to improve quality wise.

This is more of a nostalgic place than a regular restaurant. I used to come here with my grandfather when I was a kid. This place has there for more than 20 years I guess. 

Honestly this is not even close to a restaurant. This is a fast food joint which has a seating area. Tucked just below the Sonali Cinema hall, Sunny`s attracts the young crowd more because of its pricing. It is very good place for college and school students even young couples.

Lets come to food. They are known for there Chinese preparations. Mostly indian Chinese. The place is owned by a Sikh gentleman and hence the taste is mostly Indian. While ordering stick to the basics. Try Hakka noodles, Chilly chicken, Manchurian or even their lemon chicken. Never ever try the south indian preparations. They are a disaster. I have never had such a bad chutney before. Momos are decent so are the fish fry and fingers. You can also try the chole baturas. Indian items are a no no for me.

The seating is very cramped with a dim ble light glowing which makes it feel like a cheap bar even though it isn`t. The owner is a very gentle person and soft spoken.

Taste - 7/10
Ambiance - 4/10

This place is pretty small. Quantity of food is okay, but the taste is just normal. Do not expect anything extraordinary. The staffs and ambience - Well I'd give them a 1.5 .
There are better options in Dunlop than Sunny's. I would suggest you to try those out.

This is a very small resturant with a very poor seating arrangement. It is better to parcel your food from here. The food is very cheap and quantity is good. Ambience or staffs have nothing to talk about. Try out the south indian items, chicken momo and badam lassi over here.

Well, at first visit I had an awful experience with burnt chowmein and over salted food. But next visit I had parcel and it turned to be good.

Food IS good. Cheap price. Delivery is fast. Packaging is good. But the worst part of this restaurant is if you sit n eat. Very conjusted, the ceiling will hit your head, the light is too dim to see the food properly. Very small space, though air conditioned.

Aha the oldest and most loved eating joint in Dunlop for years! The sitting area is too cramped but neat. Love their dosas! Have never been so happy with dosas and pav bhaji. Perfect for a grab and run food fetish and my favourite joint in my neighboirhood so far!

Worst quality food with cockroaches moving all the way. I have seen lizards and cockroaches moving through the plates.
Had momo twice. The first time I had to bed rest for around 10 days. But I couldn't realize that it was because of the momo. The next time when I had momo, I saw myself with the same issues. A 7 day bed rest with fever the next time. I hate anti biotics. So it did take a little longer to recover. Worst food. Zero taste. Poor ambience.

An old favourite in the area. A small but seemingly well run family business. Have spent maby hours there in my younger days....but as their popularity and menu broadened, the space did not. So food is still great....but its best to take it away of get it delivered. Its a litle bit of history in the Dunlop area. Highly recommended.

Small local eatery just below Sonali Cinema Hall. Attract only local crowds. Popular for snacks like pakoras, tandoori chicken. Pretty good in making Dosas and Dahi Vada. Though it may be because no other restaurant in the locality have south indian menu. Small place, dull ambiance. But food quality good. The owners and waiter a very well behaved. Maintains a good rapport with customers.

I have been here tons of times from my college days till date and my all time favorite is the chicken mushroom soup and fried chicken. Don't try the south indian dishes here  cz they are not that good. Service is average, space is very small and suffocating. I would recommend try the soup and fried chicken,they are really yum.

First of all I am amazed to have this resturant in zomato .. this is a small restaurant on dunlop, very cheap and provides a good quality food ..but the space is too less and the blue lights are really irritating... although they provide they provide an air conditioner facility and there is a small aquarium too having a white catfish always stagnant at its place..

Jokes apart.. the taste that you get for ur tiny investment is really good .. I frequently visit this place...
Recently i had tasted the chicken hyderabadi ,chicken kadai, chicken do paiza... the taste of all the items were really good...

Probably it's my first experience of saving pocket money & eating out with friends and special ones!Located just beside Sonali cinema and has both non ac & ac portion. Sitting arrangement is barely for 30 people, so u always have to wait by the side of stairs to get a table free. To talk about the food,  both Chinese and south Indian dishes are available  having good quality.Best place for a small budget treat in Dunlop area.

This is a glorified hole-in-the wall kind of eatary which you will find next to almost every standalone cinema hall in Kolkata. Small, shabby with plastic chairs and a serious lack of legroom that will shame any budget airline.

So, how this one even remotely deserve a 4? Quite simple. Tasty food, generous portions at a cost that doesn't warrant a second look at the bill and the patient Punjabi gentleman behind the counter who owns this eatery.

Eating here is not pleasant despite AC due to lack of space. It's takeaway where this place shines. Everything comes in a spill proof container and the request of extra gravy/spice has always been taken care of.

They serve assorted fare. Bhatura/dosas are great. I love the chowmein and Chinese mains, specially the hot garlic chicken is my staple here.

Recommended.

This is near Sonali cinema hall , dunlop..  The dine in area is quite small and you might have to share your table with others customers.. but they really serve tasty food..  You can never complain about the quality and quantity of the food served. The service is quick and the service men out there are very decent..  Chicken Loly pop ,Chicken hot garlic , Sunny's special gravy chowmein are the tastiest ones.. Its really cheap... if you live near dunlop area its a 'MUST' visit place...

Sunny is always been in my Weekends Lists. You might find me devouring meals on some Saturdays. 

According to the food quality, it is always been tasty and good. If you prefer the High class standards of Star hotels please avoid this place for ambiance and hygiene and those who just love tasty street foods and damn care about the ambiance or etc stuffs, This place is for you guys. 

Always been a very affordable price good food. And for those who wander with their bike can get FREE parking, Yes, FREE parking at the Vikram AC Market. To avail it, ask the person at the parking that you want to have a meal in Sunny and at time of leaving you need to provide the PAID Bills to the parking personnel.

Foods to have 
Awesome Chicken Steamed MOMO |  Nice stuffed with chicken slices and can fill you empty stomach. 
Hong Kong Chicken | Sweet Sour Spicy Chicken pieces is a Must have dish. 

The indoor fuzzy blue lights is irritating and thus never tried to snap any food pics.

The Description: Its just beside Sonali cinema Hall at Dunlop. A small but very useful place to be at. Nice for hangouts.

The Ambeince: Place is not so big. it has 2 section Ac & Non Ac.
the A.c part is always gathered. In the dim blue lights...

The Food: Coming to the Food.... I had Chilly chicken which was really good. chicken fried really well, The gravy was nice and tasty with sour & Tikha taste. Chicken peices were also fine. Food is just too good... specially the Mix rice and Chilly Chicken item... 

The Conclusion:  Reasonable and Affordable prices. Good place to go with your freinds.... They also serve half plates and full plated for take away.

Note: The Review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Ordered lunch today from this place and it was delight.
The delivery was in time and neat.
Food was super, specially compared to the cost of food which is really cheap and extremely pocket friendly.
Had fried rice and Sanghai Boneless chicken, and the chicken was really really nice and the rice too was decent.
Quantity too was really satisfying.
One good thing is there is no minimum order rate for home delivery, they just take extra 10 bucks for it, which means if you are alone and want to order food then it will be the best option, at-least around Dunlop area.

At the outset, you will find there a crunch of seating space and may not look very clean. But the food quality, Punjabi taste, service timeline, and manager's attire are very nice and down to earth. Their specialties are South-Indian Dosha and Chinese items. The badam lassi is also very famous. Recently they have started Indian tandoori items which are also very nice and soft. The price of all the food are very very reasonable!

Sunny’s Restaurant, I should mention about its rendezvous with me since college days when I used to go there very often for tasty meals or light snacks offered at cheap rate. The place is in the middle of a very busy nook of Dunlop area.

They offer Chinese, North Indian and South Indian dishes. All or you can say most of the items are well prepared and has a freshness that is remarkable and immutable. The cons are its cramped up space which does not even let you move round the table. But this has not let down their regular customers like me to opt out of this place.

If you live near this area, Please, make a visit!

When u dont have much money in your pocket and want good food with large quantity sunny's is the place....been there juz below sonali cinema hall at dunlop since my school days....it is not that spacious one yet a nice place to hang around with friends..
I have gone there with my school friends during durga puja after all day pandal hopping...and we were superr hungry..ordered hakka noodles,chili chicken,masala dosa ,fried rice,cold drinks..
We had a great time gorging on the huge amount of food which satisfied our hunger...noodles had enough of chicken and the dosa was a huge one...idli and sambhar were awesomee..chili chicken was tasty as usual and all these we ordered for 8 people all came around within a low price of rs.800..
The ambience is homely and their service is quick..i love this place and when u dont have enough money yet u have that desire to get good food try sunny's ..i bet u will neva be disappointed..!

Sunny's has been a part of life since my school days. We used to come here for treats or just to pass some time :)

Location - Its located just beside the Sonali Cinema Hall, Dunlop(Vikram AC Market).

Ambience - The place looks a bit dull and untidy from outside. They have a mezanine floor as well with a very narrow stair to climb. I always prefer the mezanine one as a mild AC runs there.

Things to try - It is primarily a chinese snacks restaurant. But they also serve South Indian Dishes.

# Chicken Momos can be tried. They are tasty and served with a hott soup.
# Chowmien and rice are also nicely prepared and mostly people try half plates of them. As I have already mentioned people mainly come here for snacks.
# Dhosas and Uttapams are my favourites. The Sunny's Special dhosa is really a treat.

Purse Check - Very much pocket friendly with items costing around Rs.80-90 each(max).

The ambience is not so good and hygiene is an issue. But they serve very quickly and the servers are fast in taking orders.
Overall a nice place to be when you are in need for some quick snacks. :)
