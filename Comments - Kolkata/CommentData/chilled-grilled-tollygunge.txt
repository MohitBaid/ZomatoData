This is a delivery joint restaurant. You can order it from Swiggy or from Zomato Order app. Located at 141/2, Regent Colony, Tollygunge, Kolkata. 

Good Quality snacks. Fair Price. 

Maggi and Wai Wai is awesome. Cheese lovers try cheese Maggi or Wai Wai over here. Although the cheese is fairly dry and might disturb some people. Veg Cheese Wai Wai is just good but not too good because for dry cheese.

Must Try :

1) Cheese maggi and wai wai
2) Special Veg Double Cheese Burger, 
3) Veg Cheese Sandwich, 
4) Veg Penne Pasta  
5) Nachos with Salsa Dip. 

Terrible service in terms of home delivery. 
Could rate this more if the packaging is improved.

today I hv ordered two burgers and a chocolate shake with icecrm... and oh boy oh boy I did a very bad mistake... the buns were rock hard... u need a hammer to brk them..and after struggling ur mouth gets to the middle, the juicy part. There was also a surprise, the veg patty were cold and tastes like aged... I had throw the food to the trash bin where the face is saying 'USE ME' from the very first day...
then I thought OK bun was bad but u can't get it wrong with choco shake... ohhh.. They didn't fail.. it was horrible and sour... the 'USE ME' board again lighten up to me.. 
Don't know why they hv supplied this kind of bad food, is it because of online order where the customer can't trace them or not.. don't know y.. but they surly ruined my evening...  sad but they are no go food counter for me from now on....
