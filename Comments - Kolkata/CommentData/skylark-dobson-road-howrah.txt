Skylark located in Howrah AC Market, is a lovely and very impressive place to dine in.  The ambiance is pretty comforting and vibrant, sending out positive vibes once you land your foot here.It’s a perfect place for family dining.  Seating capacity is quite large and can be a great place for parties and get together with friends. We Recently had the opportunity to be a part of their food tasting session where I got to witness some of the exquisitely prepared and  mouth-watering delicacies, satisfying my taste buds to the core.

This place offers the best Indian food. The USP of this place is that it is purely vegetarian. It offers very little Chinese items too which are good. This is the perfect place for a family get together. The place is quite dimly lit and some of the waiters are really cordial. I regularly visit this place with my family because of its proximity to my house. 
This one is the next time I visited Skylark. It has been fully renovated. I tried brownie which was delicious and tutty fruity ice-cream which was bad. The previous tutty fruity used to be amazing.
