The variety of options available is amazing. The cakes are soft and the cream just melts inside your mouth. I recommend this outlet for its finger-licking bakery items.

The least expectation of quality from a cake is something better than monginis...and the sponge of this cake was horrible, as it can be seen in the picture. Only the cream was decent and the delivery was good hence the 2 rating.

I had ordered the Choco Mousse cake on 8th December, 2017. The whole experience has been pathetic. The cake had 'hairs' coming out of it. I dropped an sms on 9th December but got no response. I called the management on 10th December and told them about the issue. I even emailed the pictures. Still got no response. So there are two negatives:-

1. Quality and hygiene has been compromised.
2. Management has no regards to resolve the issue. They have not even cared to respond after receiving 2 emails.

More than the quality issue what has upset me is the absolute disregard for customer service and lack of communication.

Do not order from this place because your cake might be unhygienic and if you contact the management, they will stupidly decide to not do anything about it.

Utter SHIT. I mean that too will be an understatement if you have a taste of this place. My biggest mistake I depended on the reviews. After I took I bite, I was like what shit is this. Then I decided to take a relook at the reviews. I mean a places which is endorsed by so many people how can it be that bad. It's better to gag on stale bread than taste one of their cakes.

Coming to my order. I ordered a red velvet cream @cheese cake and a choco lava cake. Well to start with the the red velvet had only frosting on top and that bit of a good quality. There was not even a hint of cream cheese in that frosting. After I cut I realised the mistake I had made. And don't even get me started with the choco lava cake. It's like a big gooyey bournvita mix inside. Guys do me favour and please don't ruin cakes for yourselves. pathetic.
