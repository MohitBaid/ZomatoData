One of the best cakes I have tried ever. It's been a year and I have been calling all the cakes from petit fours, be it chocolate truffle cake or strawberry cake, it is just perfect in every way !

Gluten free cake can be so awesome I realized first time today. Ordered a gluten free chocolate cake and could not get over the happiness it brought me. Have tried their red velvet cake earlier. For me it was the best red velvet in the entire city.

Ordered the rosette cake from Petits Fours and it was more thanwhat I had expected. Not only was it beautiful, the red velvet was mouth watering!! The cake was devoured in less than 5 minutes. Thank you so much Petits Fours for your kind service. Will surely come back for some more xx

I have tried two cakes and both were fantastic.
1) Choco Orange Cake 
2) Fresh Strawberry Cake 

The price is also not sky- high like most other bakeries.

I often order cakes from here, they are absolutely delicious ! I have tried several flavours of cakes like eggless chocolate truffle, Red velvet cake and midnight fudge cake. The best cake I liked was Devil's Food Cake, simply mouth-watering ! . I have even ordered themed cakes from here, and it looked amazing ! The work was done very well, each detail was taken care of ! You must definitely give them a try !
