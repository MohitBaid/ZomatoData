great service. well behaved. the dry pepper chicken is too perfect. the cost is around 170 including gst. kinda ok, isnt it ? the place is pretty reasonable incase of alcohol as well. a must visit. calm place. no loud music. u can enjoy the company of ur partner or be at your own. nothing would disturb you. im hoping to visit it again. soon.
