Located in busiest street of new market, kolkata, this restaurant offers delicious continental, chinese and north indian dishes. The ambiance is good with nice decor and comfortable seating arrangements. Staffs are friendly and service is fast. Tried chicken chow with dry chili chicken. Nicely cooked, not too much spicy. Pocket friendly. Will visit again!

Oasis is a small restaurant located amidst the rush of  New Market area which serves Continental, Chinese and North Indian dishes.

Ambience is nice with well behaved staffs.

Service is swift.

Tried American Chop suey and Chicken Sandwich. Both were palatable with sufficient quantity.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Such an old school favorite! I remember this quaint little place from my earliest memories of  Kolkata. Certainly the place has seen better days, but the only reason they have stood the test of time is because of their great food. No frills! I visited the place recently and the quality of food still remains the same, though the quantity might have reduced but still justified considering the prices. Very reasonable. 

One might have to look for it a bit (right opposite the yesteryear Globe cinema, or Globe shopping center of now), as the nearby stalls seem to shield it from view. Look for the sign above and you should be able to locate it. 

Recommendations : Well, anything I guess. The chinese is equally good as their Indian fare. But, I have a weak spot for their American Chopsuey, quite possible the best I've had anywhere. 

The first floor is brighter these days than it used to be. But, I guess the place is generally less crowded like on the day I visited. If you are not looking for a fancy ambiance (though it's pretty okay and clean in my opinion) you might just want to get there for a hearty meal with the fam. Service tends to be a little slow so its great place for a relaxed afternoon. 

Here's to hoping this icon of Kolkata's classic food joints has many more years to go!

I do not know why this place has low rating. This a very old place where I used to visit with my mom dad and sis when I was a kid. That time we had not tasted a better American chopsuey anywhere. Still now it holds true.  Visited the place yesterday, yes the place has become less crowded and now the place is dying and ambience is not that good but the chopsuey renained the same. Even the indian cuisine was awesome.

A good, quiet place for a quiet meal. Standard of food is good. An old place in new market still holding its own in the competitive hospitality business in that Area.

Helloooo foodies, how are you all ??? I hope everything in your lives are crispy and delicious! If you are reading this, it means that you are a foodie or else why would anyone ever read the review of restaurants. I think we all are foodies here. Who doesn’t love to eat good food…!  I literally live to eat. Okay, so without wasting much time let me take you straight to one of the old restaurants of Kolkata. Yep this restaurant has renovated itself but I’ll still call it old because I can remember visiting this particular restaurant since I was a child.
