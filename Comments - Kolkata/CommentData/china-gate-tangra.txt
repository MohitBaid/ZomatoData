Service is good,but quality of food is very very poor.we ordered red pepper chicken and the food sucks... it's better you go some place else and don't waste your money over here

We went 4 boys at China town & there were no restaurants available for bachelor  only this  small not so well-known restaurant became our shelter 
Prices are  quite reasonable & the food was fine & the service was also good 
I pray that this restaurant may get some recognition!!!

This place, again a not so famous restaurant inside china town. Located just in between Big boss and China pearl, the restaurant doesn't provide you anything like other authentic chinese places do. Have you heard about the word "Shabby"?? I am sure you have.... so if you are asked to site an example of a shabby place, you can go ahead confidently and say "China Gate". The moment you enter the place, your inner mind will pinch you " ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶•‡¶æ‡ßü ‡¶è‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶Æ" !! A broken window AC, dirty tables of dinosaur era, lights are so deemed that you can't even see things properly.
Anyhow we took a table and placed order for the drinks and starters. The first item was dry manchurian chicken and then we opted for red pepper fish dry. Here is a twist - definitely it would be an overhype if I compare it with other china town places, but trust me - both the items were better and in quantitative amount. Price of the food is standard but could have been a bit less considering the amenities and interior where they are arranging people to sit.
Few points to highlight -
1. Parking is an issue, better you take an ola or uber
2. No smoking inside
3. Vat and service tax both are applied on drinks as well as food
4. Not recommended for families, the washroom is very dirty.
5. Insist the waitor for non spicy items - coz when you say "spicy" they interprets it as to add more chillis üòÄüòÄ
