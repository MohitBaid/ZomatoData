This is a very beautiful place to chill with your friends and they do not even make a big hole in your pocket.
We have been there recently and loved the place. The boutique is really nice and the entire place is instagram worthy.

The ratings are as follows:

Food- 4.5/5
Ambience- 4.5/5
Hospitality- 4/5

The rating is purely based on the decor and staff courtesy as I did not found the food up to level but if you wanna have some quality time over a cup of coffee with anyone then u can visit ..
Still I feel they should upgrade their menu card .
Again mentioning the decor is very homely and you can read books.. even you can shop from a boutique which is inside the main area.loved the antique tea kettle and that's why  attaching the picture of that.

Went there to attend a tee shirt mela organised by the cafe & for that reason the kitchen was serving beverages only.The coffee was served promptly & the men out their were courteous.The decor was minimalistic with a hint of quirkiness.May be I will visit later to taste their food.But yes,the mela was a hit,offering tee shirts to spoil you with choices in an affordable range.Some were even exclusive pieces.Loved them!

Located just beside the TURTLE showroom between Sulekha and Baghajatin. This Cafe is good to spend some time with your friends - to have a good discussion or reading some books. The Cafe has a unique but very casual decor. Also you have quite a variety of books to read in the Cafe. Coming to the food- it tastes ok but the portions are quite less;Can be improved. Tried the chicken pizza with regular Tea. Prices are quite low and affordable.
Overall 3.5/5

Just near 8B bus stand, it's a go to place for jadavpur university students
Visited a couple of months ago. A cool place to hangout with friends or even alone. They have an in-house library and comfortable seating arrangement. We ordered chicken sandwich and nuggets. The portions were a tiny bit disappointing. I am sure they have improved because I have heard from friends who recently visited and am planning to visit again soon. Will update once I visit.
The ambience is really great and the service is good too. They also sell hand painted t-shirts and other cool merchandise. 
Definitely give it a visit !

Just near the axis bank ATM in Jadavpur. A typical JU atmosphere. You can go upstairs and sit on the mat or on the stools. Promotes the typical Adda sessions with tea and snacks.
Just with the added comfort of an AC. They sell books, t-shirts, jewelry, notepads, bags. Almost anything and everything.
Decor has been inspired from the by lanes of JU. I would suggest them to keep more novels in English. Mostly political novels. Stock up more on story books.

We had coffee which came around 20 bucks. The price was fine so was the coffee. We thought of having chicken nuggets with French fries. The price we pay for it and the amount we get was a real disappointment. 4 chicken nuggets and 10 French fries costs 75rs. I mean that's not student friendly at all. Also, the nuggets were dry. 

It's a good start up, and they're also relocating to a new area from August mid.

This place is near Jadavpur 8B...near axis bank ATM..iy is little bit of different then any of the places in kolkata..but if you are like to discuss regarding bengali litarature or like to discuss politics this place is perfect for you. You can easily find people who love to write bengali novels or anything regarding bengaliiiii...You dont have much options but you can go for sandwich or maggi or pasta or fried chicken which is taking little bit of more time.

Also, they are going to open a new shop near sulekha..where you can also enjoy music...so if you are in kolkata kindly visit the new one...you really fall in love once you enter this place...AC, no tax,just sit on the floor take novels and gossip with friends..just woww

This place have a homely atmosphere.. Very nicely decorated with stuffs, ready to be purchased. It's a small place, situated in Jadavpur in a very hidden way, I guess :P :D The food they prepare is very pocket friendly and mouth-watering at the same time. I loved the Chicken Salad from the menu, its really tasty guys!! Please take the stairs up to feel the relaxed ambience of the place, sitting comfortably on the mat. So people who stay nearby or likes to visit Cafes with friends, should give it a try. Hope to visit soon!! :) ;)

The location is well-hidden, in my opinion. Mostly frequented by JU students.

The ambiance is okayish. Made me feel like I was sitting in a mess hall. Coffee was quite good, but not as good, or not as much quantity as to pay 30 rupees for it.

Somewhat overpriced. Good place to go to if you wanna sit for addas or just study. Has a small bookshelf and some goodies that can be purchased.

Though a good hangout joint for college students still there are few areas in which this cafe needs to improve.
Firstly the place needs to get maintained. I sat in a mat beside which there was full of dust including a shoe box which was lying just like that which did not give me a good feeling.
Secondly the presentation of food was not good at all. I took ham sandwich which they served in paper plates. I would like to mention that they do not serve chips with sandwiches. This is not accepted from a cafe cause even the road side stalls give chips with sandwiches. The amount of salad which included only two slices of cucumber and one slice of tomato is just not worthy in respect of the price. Besides the cucumber which was inside the sandwich was bitter in taste which made the sandwich worse.
Thirdly, the food is costly in respect of quantity.
They have tried to put up some innovation in the store by keeping books, accessories, t-shirts and bags still lots of improvement is required to make it an effective place to hangout and to create curiosity and interest among the youngsters.

Such a cool cafe i hav ever hopped. One day, after my college,found a very small lane extremely near the 8b bus-stand,jadavpur. Before seeing the actual gate, i got dozen of cc-tv camera by right side. No, those were only lights(Starting of creativity). Going inside i hav found a staircase and wend upside. Bong decorated with maadur,mora, carrom board and a small library. It will give u a feel of ur own lazy room. Some 'bong' graphic tees are bough out there. 
Foods are mainly snacks : chicken, pork Maggie, chicken pork salad, sandwiches, coffee and cold drinks are available and those are very pocket friendly. 
The best place for back to home students, after a busy day. Because , the ultimate motto of this cafe is ''lyadh and adda, pure adda" .

I would have never come to know about this hidden cool place if one of my acquaintances had not told me about it. So after my sem got over, my friends and I hit this place at around 3 in the afternoon.  Comfortably air conditioned, creatively decorated place with two floors, upper one for seating. There a few cane stools and mattresses laid on the floor. So make yourself comfortable , order a few snacks, and have a good time with your pals. They don't have much items on menu,  we ordered a chicken cheese omlette, masala coke, grilled chicken sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich and lemonade. The sandwiches were nicely done. The omlette was good too. There are books , bags, tshirts to check out and buy if you like. Cool hangout place for especially the J.U students. Gonna visit here often now.

Unfortunately, I am unlucky as I could not taste the chicken mayo salad. Well , next time I will taste it. The decor is quite interesting and it is a nice place for giving Adda in this hot summer days.

It's a nice little place to hang out with your friends for a cup of tea and sandwiches, but it's not at all spacious. Till now I have visited this joint twice and the lack of space did not cause any issue of concern. The food is good and affordable, actually it is very cheap. We had Masala Cold drinks priced 20 Rupees and Cheese Sandwich 40 Rupees along with Chicken Sandwich at only 60 Rupees. Besides the décor is very creative and they have a good collection of T-shirts and bags and books. Sampriti Chakraborty

This cafe is located in the  8B bustand area. The interior is quite innovative with wall graffiti, you can also get innovative tshirts, bengali books , cards and mugs as well. I had lemon honey tea and pork mayo salad. Lemon honey tea is quite good. Pork mayo salad is okay, there are lot more scopes to improve as well.  This decor is much like a college canteen.  They are going to launch new food items as well. Looking forward to have it.
