I Don't Know How They Make Beverages.But It Should Be Better.In My Opinion Beverage Avoidable.Still not tested many things so that's why I can't explain more except beverages.Pick one Cold Drink Bottol from outside and enjoy delightfully

When you're out of pocket but wish to hang out in KFC, 'The Shack' would be a perfect place for that! üòâThis spot is located in Bytes Food Court. We ordered 'Chicken Pop Wings' and 'Fries' . The crispy fried wings with ketchup dip is always a formidable option as snack. Moreover, the spicy fries added an extra flavor as delicacy. So, can be called a smaller version of KFC which will also save you a lot of bucks. Great experience, Give it a try! üòãüëç

When you're in search for small version of KFC,this is the right place. We ordered chicken pop wings and a coke.The taste was good.But they added a lot of chat masala over chicken wings.Reasonable price.Pocket friendly.

Wraps, mexicans burger and fried chicken(More or less what they have :P)
The best thing about this burger joint is that their chicken isnt the same "golden fried kfc chicken". It has spices all over, making it delicious. Quantity is huge. Burgers are big and spicy. Wraps will be a meal for one. Very heavy. 

Suggestion:

1) Please dont send each every item in one plastic. That is common sense man. French fries got all soggy. Use paper boxes for fried chicken as that will keep it crunchy and hot for a long time. And 2 in one packing please. Last day you guys stuffed 4 in one paper bag. Thats just silly guys. 

2) add chicken wings to your menu.

It is located inside the Bytes Food Court. We ordered some Fries, Chicken Shack Burgers and Fried Chicken. The Fries were tender, nicely cooked and was sprinkled with spices. They tasted good and so were the burgers. The chicken fillet used in the burger was juicy and nice, and the burger had ample stuffings. The worst part was the Fried Chicken pieces. The chicken pieces were uneatable and had a weird kind of smell.. When asked the person at the counter to look into it, he enquired the thing with the people inside the kitchen and informed us that by mistake they didn't use fresh oil to prepare the fries. So this kind of mistakes were just unacceptable! A wanna-be KFC this place is no where near to it. Another thing, the burgers which we ordered on that day was okay but I have heard many negative reviews later on about the different types of burgers served at the very outlet.

Although the other reviews about this place don't seem impressive, we had a good experience with them. We ordered two burgers, one Mexican and  one Tandoori, both of them were good. Well priced and filling. The Mexican Burger is highly recommended. Do opt for the fries.

I had an amazing experience with shack whenever I order from them. Be it the mexican chicken burger or the chicken strips, I loved them all. Though I found the french fries way more spicy then it should be but the chicken wings were soft and moist. I prefer takeaway because its damn hot outside and never been disappointed. These guys are doing a great job!

Nearbuy took me to this place because its mega meal deal looked quite appealing and pocket friendly... This place is just opposite RDB Boulevard.... There are few other eatery stalls also along with The Shacks... 

Got the mega meal which consists of 2 chckn burgers, 6 pcs fried chicken, 2 regular fries and 2 coke...! I was attracted with the quantity of food offered by nearbuy..but the quality of food does matter and the shack disappointed me in disüòû. Burgers were just okay, fried chicken were saltless making the chicken tasteless and simply waste... They forgot to add salt or its dis the way they cook i don't know.... French fries were yummy having a different masala on it which i really liked a lot... 

I may never visit the shack againnnnnn...!

On some days you are destined to explore a great eatery and on some unfortunate days you end up having your meal (or rather wasting your money) at some joint where you swear never ever to go back again. The Shack happened to be one such joint explored on one such unfortunate day! I really hate to write about places which are serving food which shouldn't have been served, places which are not putting in their honest efforts in serving good food products; but then these reviews are equally important to let people know about the quality of food being served at these joints and to let the management know about our honest feedbacks on which they can improve.

LOCATION - - - - - This is a small kiosk placed inside the Bytes Food court at the ground floor of Infinity Benchmark building (opposite RDB Boulevard at Saltlake Sector-5).

AMBIANCE - - - - - The kiosk has no ambiance of its own, it‚Äôs in the Bytes food court where you will be seated. The food court is well lit with neat seating arrangements which are quite crowded at lunch hours. The overall ambiance is pretty humble and noisy at lunch hours, making the background music pretty unpleasant for the ears.

FOOD - - - - - The place serves burgers, wraps, fried chicken, nuggets, soft drinks, etc. I ordered one Mexican Egg Burger and Coke. Not sure why the coke which I ordered separately after finishing my burger was pretty watery and the Mexican Egg Burger was the worst burger I have had in my entire life. Firstly the pictures of food products printed on their menu card are not true, they are misleading, they are just googled images! Even the person serving our food at the counter advised me not to go by the pictures, they are all incorrect. I should have refrained from ordering anything right after learning this but I unfortunately went on with my order. The Mexican egg burger strangely had just minced carrots, cabbage leaves and onions inside drenched in a tasteless spicy super-hot reddish sauce that was bit grainy, felt as if I have got dust inside my mouth! The egg was a hard poached one which was individually okayish. The bun was pretty ordinary. All together the burger was inedible! Yes I could not finish 30% of it. I simply hate wasting food and this joint almost compelled me to do the same. The sauce was so spicy, tasteless and dusty that I felt like handing it back to the person at the eatery. In the end I just gulped down the poached egg and threw the burger in waste bin.

SERVICE - - - - - Service was pretty okayish according to me, the food was handed over in quick time. The person accepting the order was courteous.

SUMMARY - - - - - This place is 'the KFC gone wrong'. I would request the management to take the criticism positively and look into the quality of the food being served. Also the wrong pictures on the menu card should be corrected, people shouldn't be fooled. As of now, I am not going back to this place any time soon.

Cheers!

Though a cheap alternative, it is not a value for money proposition. I had ordered Maharaja Veg combo for delivery from Foodpanda. Though the menu says the combo comes with 4 veg strips, I got veg patties. The patties were very very oily and hard like a wadi. And to top it, it was the same patty with some veggies in the burger, plain ordinary and no maharaja of any kind. But I shouldn't complain for the prices they charge.

Since our tummy weren't filled after eating at old China we ordered to basic chicken burgers from this outlet. Nothing to write about. Very late in serving the burgers. Even though the patties were just store bought and deep fried and way too less lettuce in the burger. But for the price it is fine I guess.

A small fast food outlet inside the "Bytes Food Court" of Sector V.

Decided to try out this place since I enjoy experimenting.
Preparation time was not too much. Some English numbers keep on playing in the background. Ambience is nothing great and staff was polite.
Coming to the most important part - food !¬†
I ordered Veg Maharaja Burger Combo - which included a Burger, 4 pcs Veg Strips & 1 Coke. Unfortunately, veg strips had to be replaced with aloo strips as the former was not available.
¬†The Burger was average sized, with minimal vegetables - which really disappointed me. From no angle, it seemed like a Maharaja Burger!¬†Also, aloo tikki was average and very oily.
Lastly, Fountain Thumbs up was served with almost zero fizz.

Overall, a very disappointing experience.

Please improve !

I don't know if this is Zomatos fault or Chicken Shacks fault, but this is disgusting service. 
A call or some sort of initiative should be taken to ensure better customer relations.
