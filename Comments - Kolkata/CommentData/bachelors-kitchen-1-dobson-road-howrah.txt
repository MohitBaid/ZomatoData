About 3 weeks ago I've ordered yellow dal , dal makhani, tandoori roti, chapati and mix pulao . What happened is that the yellow dal was smelling very bad , dal makhani was tasteless , chapati and tandoori roti were rubbery and was so difficult to tear off one part and also veg pulao was sticky and stinky . I was very disappointed with your service. Hope you'll try to improve your service and satisfy the customer

I ordered their Royal Thali. It was good.
Loved the fruit custard and doodh cola specially.
It would be great if you people could start continental as well. 
Good Luck !!!

Nothing special or worth a try . Would recommend some other place nearby ...say SKYLARK , KHANA KHAZANA etc . Not at all a place for hanging out with friends .
About the food ... It's quiet decent , nothing extraordinary .
Would recommend to find another place to spend your time .
Also there is not a wide array / variety in beverages .
