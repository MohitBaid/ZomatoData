Visited the place last saturday.. though we went the smoke shack but it was booked for a private party. So that we went k19 for dinner. After entering the place no one came to us to assist us,even after seating for 10 mins no one came to us..then i asked one of staff for menu card...he gave it almost after 10 mins along with water... then we ordered food and most of the food which were mentioned in the menu card were not available especially 90% of dessert option were unavailable. It was too much disappointment to us. The service is also too slow. They served us aftr 45 mins from receiving our order. I m giving the 3 point only for the taste of food. In between all these disappointment, the taste of the food brought some pleasure to my mind...
now coming to the food.. we ordered kulcha, chicken biryani and mutton roganjosh. All off the preparation was good enough. One thing i liked so much is the chicken given in the biryani and mutton both were well cooked and soft enough. But among all of them., the kulcha was the best. Actually i m a big fan of kulcha of itc sonar but after tasting their kulcha i became a big fan of it. Lastly i should say about their  complementary papad which was also good... bt due to scarcity of dessert we had to skip it..

K19 at Park plaza is a mixed bag. On one hand, the spread seemingly leaves one spoiled for choices, however it fails to justify the price tag it comes with. The number of dishes rival any buffet restaurant in the city, but most of them are ordinary to taste, and nothing really special or outstanding. The Chinese is pretty bland in fact, Indian is better but, I wished they had served black Dal instead of yellow. The Ala Carte menu seems much better in comparison. We had ordered a lasagna, and it was the best dish we tasted all day. 
Ultimately, K19 buffet isn't worth your money (some of the desserts are good though), but you can do a 1 time visit if you prefer Ala Carte.

Went yesterday for the Christmas Cake mixing ceremony and it was my first ever cake mixing. I was delighted and enjoyed the whole process of getting dressed up, mixing it with wine. The whole process was so soothing. 
Loved the atmosphere there. Even had light snacks like paneer pakoras , chilli chicken and pastries.

Pros: 
Big space, well decorated & pleasant ambience.
Few unusual Buffet recipes.
Polite & courteous service. 
Can't forget the chilled Mint Mocktail !!

Cons: 
Non-veg recipes not up to the mark.
Although, they were nice, but the impact didn't last long.

Anyways, it's a nice place to give it a try. Also, an amazing place for hosting various parties.

We went for buffet on saptami night during Durga puja! But to my disappointment the buffet spread was limited. The quality of the food was okayish. The quality of the food was not upto the mark to the price of the buffet They need to improve a lot on the options available in the buffet spread. The ambience was nice. They only have 2 chicken starter, 1 fish and 2 veg starters which should be improved for better experience. The salads were good. All in all the experience was moderate.

The ambiance and the location of this restaurant are deceitful. I went here one weekend and tried the buffet dinner. They charge an exorbitant price per person and deliver too little in return. The chief complaint I have is that they have a very misleading and limited menu. Salads, chaats and snacks fill the entire space in the menu, and they get away with offering only a couple of proper dishes. The starters were okay-ish, and that's the only reason I'm awarding the two points. The main course was terrible- the quality as well as the variety. The desserts were satisfactory, but when one pays such an outrageous price for dinner, this shabby buffet miserably fails to meet expectations. I'd strongly advise against falling for this overpriced, sub-standard food service.

We had the buffet, Durga Puja Bengal  lunch, at K 19 on 27.09.17. Very reasonably priced for a 5 Star Hotel establishing its presence on the Kolkata culinary scene. The starting time  misleadingly set at 12.30pm, was actually well after 1pm, making the wait avoidable. The soup was mysteriously called “chicken jhal jhol”, non-existent in Bengali cuisine, but piquant enough.. The starters, salads and desserts were excellent, as also the bread selection. The main dishes less so, the fish over-fried to last the stretch, the biryani ok but forgettable, the luchis on the flat side. The décor of the hotel and the restaurant, is far-east themed and strikingly well-done. The staff members were cheerful and helpful. Hopefully as the hotel receives more public attention, the buffet will hit the right spot, but possibly then the price will go up too. Considering all factors I would give it a 3.5

It's ordinary belief that the more you pay for a meal, the better it is supposed to be. Well, this place definitely will prove you wrong. Located in one of the finest hotels, K19 is one of the worst buffet I have had the misfortune of paying for. The Dineout offer made me greedy to give a try to this place, and with the options it seemed to be offering, I found it a chance worth taking. But I was SO wrong!

1. The spread is very limited for the price they charge you. There are barely 2-3 non-veg items in the main course, and a couple in the appetiser section. The entire spread consists of salads and chaats mostly, with some place for the dessert, which are pretty much the regular. Now, surely you don't want to pay nearly 1400 for that!

2. The food quality is BAD. The baby corn was probably the only good thing I found in the appetiser section, and the fish served in the main course stinked so badly that I couldn't even have it. The rest of the dishes were forgettable. Only the papri chaat and puchkas were as per my liking. Not even the desserts!

3. I don't want to comment on the management. While we were dining, the kadhai in the kitchen suddenly caught fire (they have a kitchen facing the dining area), and they have such great managerial ability that people were simply standing, perplexed as to what to do. After a good 5 minutes later, a person went to extinguish it. And 2 minutes later, the phenomenon gets repeated. What are you even supposed to make of that!!! 

Overall, it was a pathetic dining experience, where even the desserts couldn't sweeten my mood. And as far as recommendation goes, a big NO.

Due to the proximity of my house to this place, I've barely ever visited Park Plaza. Ended up going to K-19 for a business lunch and it was just that.

The business lunch had a small buffet which consisted of 2 salads, 2 veg dishes, 2 non veg dishes, 1 daal, rice, naan's and 2 desserts.

The menu was short and to the point, the food tasted well, the paneer was good, the meat was well cooked. If you're in for a short, formal lunch, K 19 does the job!

Mouthwatering Pongal Special Dishes at K19, Park Plaza..!

India being a country of diversity and a mix of various cultures, the culinary likings and preparations also tend to differ as you move from one place of this country to another. The Southern Part of India are usually famous for their Dhosas, Vadas, Idlis and Filter Coffee. But then, we often forget the contribution of some of the legendary Non-Vegetarian dishes which has originated from such places. Similar to the fact of us preparing grandeur dishes may be on the occasion of Lakhshmi Puja or Saraswati Puja, Pongal happens to be festival something very near and dear to the people residing up in the Southern Part of India. Park Plaza, a reputed hotel celebrated the upcoming of Pongal by bringing in two legendary chefs from down South and by offering some lipsmacking and mouthwatering dishes.
                                                                ...

Was highly disappointed by their buffet spread which came as shock and surprise considering the same hotel has an awesome lounge smoke shack.. it was pretty average food at cost of INR1300 plus tax.. I didn't expect this to be that bad.. neither the desert not the chart counter.. nothing was fascinating.. being a posh restaurant you definitely can't expect people to come have Chaat and puchka out there.. had that been the case I would have tried street food instead..

The outlet is situated on the 2nd floor of the otherwise dazzling hotel. Its having a nice, big sit-out area and an evenly spread buffet. The dessert counter is spread in the center- chat counter is at the backside and there is something called a ragda chat counter (don’t know what it meant) which was dishing out ghugni with various add-ons.

The service was nice and we were greeted almost immediately and were led to the respective table allocated. We were offered a nice and strong cup of masala tea (chose from an assortment).
 And the food was served. We have the visuals below with short descriptions. 

Probably, I am laughing because personally I don’t feel ,like having street food at some posh restaurant (hygiene factor considered) but the food here was ok-ish at best….. Probably the kitchen team was having a bad-day or somebody at the kitchen was seriously pissed-off that day with the management. Anyway, happens with everybody. Final verdict ???

k-19- K-19 is a multi-cuisine restaurant offering global cuisine with local flavours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and this place is located in Gariahat, a popular place in Kolkata. The sitting area is very spacious and inside the restaurant there is a separate bar room which is also pretty good in ambiance as it consists Buddha statue. The kitchen is covered with clear glass so you can watch Chef's cooking while enjoying your food.  A luxurious dining place, with mouth-watering food.

South-indian food festival was on the floor and got an invitation to try some of their best dishes. They hired Chef Kanon who is a specialist in south Indian dishes, for this special occasion. The menu was stuffed with various south indian dishes with their authentic names and descriptions. Every items we had just more than delicious, cooked very well and perfect blend of south indian spices and aroma! A pleasant experience.

Thanks a ton

If you love South Indian food, and want to celebrate Pongal with authentic food, then Park Plaza should be your destination till the 22nd of January, 2017. The place is hosting a 10-day food festival where the flavours from down South will be up for grabs. From savoury delights like Kozhi charu, Chennai Meen Kolambhu, Nellai Kozhi Khorma, Gongura Mamisa Koora, Vendaikai More Kolambhu, Kathamba Sambar, Urulai Idicha Masala, Seenai Kal Varuval to desserts like Aval Payasam, there’s a wide array of delicacies to delight your taste-buds at the South Indian Food Fiesta at K19 – Park Plaza for Pongal, and that includes both veg and non-veg items.

Nothing standing out in the buffet and the items were bland and basic. There was only an eggs to order live counter, nothing else. Some of the items on the spread was cold too.

personally the  experience is mixed one.

1.5yr back when i visited this place i didnot like the food taste.

and recently in 6 month when i went again for dinner .the food was awesome.

I think they have changed the chef .

Also 1 suggestion to the restaurant manager .
Increase the variety of Indian Dessert in Buffet .this is only thing which u lack in ur buffet menu.

Pongal is one of the most popular harvest festival of South India, mainly Tamil Nadu. Pongal falls in the mid-January every year and marks the auspicious beginning of Uttarayan - sun's journey northwards.
It coincides with the festival Makara Sankranthi celebrated throughout India as the winter harvest.
This year Chef Kannan has announced his arrival in Kolkata with his Authentic South Indian Delicacies.
So we kolkatans have great opportunity to sneak into enjoy South Indian Culinary and place can't be even better when it's at K19 , Park Plaza. All day Fine Dining Experience in lavish ambience and decor.

Nirvana and K19 service - the body language of the staff - the communication skill - the hospitality, could not have been worst. I really regret spoiling my wife's birthday yesterday. The staff regrets that the guests have come and they will have to make an effort. They perhaps have been picked up by a local canteen.

Located in Park Plaza. No issues with the interiors and the ambience. Vast variety to choose from! 
Good Quality food.
Ordered for Tuscan Minestrone soup - which was heart winning. 
North Indian was perfect, Italian was way too good. If you love vegetables do order Garlic marinated Grilled Vegetables. 
The prices are comparatively high and service could be a little more fast. 

Rest no cons. 

Happy Eating!

Being a restaurant inside a branded hotel doesnt mean it has to be good. One of the worst restaurants i have ever visited. Everything got messed up with every minute. Nether the food is good nor the service. Those 2 points that youve achieved is also just for the interiors and ambience. Thats about it. You guys need to really work on the food. Its TASTELESS!

Though the ambience was good and the staffs were well mannered the food quality and the buffet menu wasn't good at all.The value for money should be 2 as the quality of food doesn't matches the buffet prices that the restaurant have.

If you want to have a luxurious dining this place is absolutely perfect.Went their for buffet lunch on my birthday and the ambiance was definitely the first thing to attract.Service was prompt and good.Its good place to visit if you have some coupon offers since its a bit overpriced in comparison to the food served.
We were served:
1.Starters
Chicken Cream Soup-Absolutely perfect with grilled toast to complement with.
Fish Talatil-Well fried,fish was good and fresh,crispiness is totally awesome and a cheese dip to  go with.
Summer Cooler-Best mocktail have ever tested,perfect for the hot summer afternoon.
2.Main course:
Nun,dal makhni,kadhai chicken-After those finger licking dishes,it was a totally horrible lunch.
Nun was not that soft,chicken was not that juicy and dal makhni had no taste.
3.Desserts
Gajar ka halwa and chocolate icecream-The presentation was good with tulsi leaves on the top.I dont mind a horrible lunch if the desert was perfect to end with.A hot gajar ka halwa with cool chocolate ice cream will automatically rebuild your mood.
Last but not the least, a very good place with a very good interiors as well as good food (except the main course ofcourse) as well as prompt service will automatically make u feel to visit the place again

Such a wonderful place to take your date to! This place is absolutely soothing to the eyes. The staff is so very polite. Always ask them for suggestions, and trust me you wont be dissapointed. The food is costly. And they do 87% justice to the price. Comes in huggeah amount. Not bad,  eh?

Just sitting at the place and writing the review. After watching a very late night film and visiting a few Puja Pandal was tempted to visit this place to gorge on the sandwich at this hour. Alas they don't have more platters to offer at this hour. Overall a nice place to unwind after a night out.

I went to Park plaza Ballygunge with my friends. Loved the mouth-watering dishes that this hotel offers. The hotel is already decked up for the pujas and we were delighted by the extra-ordinary ambience. Got to know, that K19 has come up with special lunch and dinner buffet for the 5 days of Durga puja. I will surely come back to this place as this is offering Chaade Adda during the festive days. The major pandals of south Kolkata are near it and that simply makes it my favourite. Plan to visit the 5 days of Durga puja. Can I get any sort of special deals for it?

Food quality definitely great. Especially their non veg club sandwich. With an appetite like mine, I found it hard to finish. Coupling it with tea, coffee or fresh lime soda is always a pleasant option any time of the day. Despite stating 24X7 service there was no one around in the middle of the night on one occasion. Felt bad for the single waiter and chef who woke up to prepare our meal.

Hungry at odd hours, K-19 every ready to serve. K-19 is a multi-cuisine, 24-hour dining experience with a menu inspired by flavours from around the globe. Open daily, this contemporary-styled Indian restaurant is ready to serve you the best of the global cuisine. Was invited to the Ramadan special dinner buffet - dining the Awadhi way.

Location: 2nd floor, park plaza. The park plaza is located in the bylane just beside gariahat pantaloons. A few yards of walk and you hit head-on onto park plaza.

Decor and Ambience: The interiors are designed in a contemporary style with elegant cluster seating, rendering a serene look.

Food: Going onto the food way, The buffet menu is elaborate, and includes the mandatory Haleem , Biryani and Firni along with other dishes, salads, sherbets, vegetarian and non vegetarian main course and of course, desserts.

STARTERS:

1. MACHHI TALATIL - a fish appetizer, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Melted in the mouth. This was amazing indeed.

2. SAUFIYAN PANEER TIKKA - the conventional paneer tikka docked in with fennel seeds was yet another dish to relish.

3. PEYAZ KA PAKORA - the same old conventional taste, crispy as never.

SALAD:

1. WARM MASALEDAR RED CHANA SALAD - the masala wrapping up the chickpeas was an amazing affair.

2. ASSORTED FRUIT CHAT - the ultimate way to break Ramadan and to start on with the iftaar is by having fruits, and indeed the fruit chat was much needed.

'Bangalir Baro Maas e Tero Parbon' roughly translates in to 'Bengalis celebrate thirteen festivals in twelve months'. The celebrations &accompanied by grand feasts are what we look forward to break away from the monotony of everyday life. It doesn't matter whether the festivals are religious, cultural or geographical we always find a way to overcome the boundary. One such festival has to be Eid-Al-Fitr, which in spite of being a Islamic festival, is celebrated throughout the world.
A unique celebration where the believers fast for throughout the day for a month to commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad. May be as a foodie what attracts me most is the Ramzan special delicacies. These are dishes which aren't normally prepared throughout the year, only during the month of fasting they are served at the iftar i.e the meal consumed at the end of the day to mark the end of the daily fasting. Not only the popular haleem, fruits, salads,kebabs & traditional desserts are also served in iftar which has grown into banquet festivals in recent times.
The restaurants in the city took up the opportunity to serve some excellently cooked delicacies in the Ramzan Special Buffet. K-19, Park Plaza did not lag behind. Already known for its all day buffet spread which is well appreciated by the foodies & regulars alike, K-19 has recently introduced a Night Revellers Buffet available from 10pm-1am at a discount of 50% on the original price. For the Ramzan special buffet, Chef Jayanta Bannerjee & his team has added some special dishes to the usual spread of soups, salads & desserts.
PanchPhoron was invited over along with other food bloggers of the city for a tasting of these special items, & this is my short review for the items I tried.

Machhi Talatil:
The first to arrive, an appetizer which somewhat resembles fish fingers, but much more flavourful due to the generous sprinkle of sesame seeds on top. The crunchy outer layer & the soft inner layer was just a perfect match.

Saufiyan Paneer Tikka:
Chunks of cottage cheese lightly coated in the tikka style marinade of ginger garlic Chilli & saying paste, this too was good in taste, but surely I liked the fish one better.

Peyaz ka Pakora:
Simple onion fritters, crunchy & crispy, these quite vanished from the plates, the moment they were being served.

Salads:
Warm Masaledar Red Chana Salad / Assorted Fruit Chaat.
The assorted fruit Chaat was a great addition, since that is one of the most common items for the 'iftar'.
However I was looking forward to their non veg items, hence skipped the salads.

Nizami Murgh Biryani:
This was the show stopper. The mix of coloured rice & cooked chicken pieces has always been my favourite. This one was perfectly cooked, & the boiled potato with the imbibed flavours , was just mouth watering my delicious, both to look at & eat.

Afgani Machhi:
Although the gravy was decent & flavourful, I didn't quite like the fish. The piece I had was a bit over fried, giving the outer layer a undesired crispy feel. Maybe I was unlucky, but this didn't appeal much to me.

Gosht Haleem:
This, is what I was eagerly waiting for. This year our group visited a no. Of restaurants in search of the best haleem served in the city. This mutton haleem served at K19 has to be among the best. The rich gravy with chunks of well cooked mutton, this was absolutely cherisheable to the last morsel. Some unlike me like their haleem with the meat totally dissolved in the soup. But I like this version more.

Awadhi Style Aloo Methi Masala / Chukunder Paneer/ Sultani Dal / Mazmuah E Subziyat / Achari Arbi:
These items were in the spread , however I didn't try them.

Pakizah Phirnee:
This thick creamy blend of milk & rice was really delicious. In fact I had a big spoonful serving of the same. Perfect blend of flavours & optimally sweet this was a good ending note to the spicy meal.

Aam Halwa:
I wouldn't call this a Halwa, since the usual texture of Halwa is missing. This one is far more smoother with chunks of ripe mango flesh added to the aromatic mix of condensed milk & mango. Absolutely loved this one.

Thus ended a great meal. The biryani & the haleem were perfect. The fish in the mains disappointed, however the starter was outstanding. As good were the desserts. I would definitely recommend this one to people looking for some really great foods. Even after the Ramzan Special, K19 will continue serving their all day buffet & the Midnight Revelers buffet, which are as delicious as they are value for money.

This upscale hotel,Park Plaza,is located in the lane beside Gariahat Pantaloons.On walking inside the lane,after crossing Mirch Masala restaurant,one will find the gates of this hotel.There are 3 posh restaurants and a lobby pastry shop, plus a swanky bar with a giant Buddha sculpture. We were invited to their restaurant,K19,by Candid Communications for their Ramzan Blogger’s meet where they served a variety of food in their buffet.K19 is located on the second floor of the Park Plaza hotel,characterized by good interiors and nice ambience,this restaurant is easily noticeable if one steps on to the second floor.Seating arrangements are comfortable,with tables accommodating as many people as a large family or a small one specially suited for a couple.They have a live kitchen which allows guests to interact with the chefs while dining.

Ramzaan ends soon with Eid. Keeping in mind the ongoing festivities and upcoming Eid celebrations, K-19 at the Park Plaza Kolkata have introduced a new Ramzaan Special buffet, where you can go for your Iftaar or dinner with your loved ones.

I am a frequent visitor to K-19 and have been since Park Plaza opened up in the City of Joy. They usually have a great Buffet Spread on offer both in terms of variety and quality. As its Ramzan they have included some special items for their patrons and we were invited by the Management for a tasting.

If you are looking for a good buffet in Kolkata, you should definitely go to K-19 at Park Plaza, Ballygunge. Their spread is huge and they have a wide selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes and desserts. Recently, they have also started a rather interesting Night Revellers Buffet, available from 10 pm – 1 am, specially created for late night party goers. And the best thing about the buffet is that you get to eat all that food at a discount of 50%! For Ramzan, K-19 has included a few special dishes in the dinner and Night Revellers Buffet and I was invited by the management for a tasting.

As a matter of fact, I want to thank my dad. We went to Park Plaza for deciding on their banquet for my marriage reception last Sunday and ended up having the Sunday Brunch they  which was delicious. Though I am yet to finalise on the party but I will consider visiting for Sunday brunch again.

A regular again and sometimes at odd hours. 10 visits so far. And I keep getting back. For diet freaks try Cobb salad... I like the Thai green curry .   My mutton roganjosh and assorted breads. Chicken steak is just above average. Try bolognaise and lasagne. But we are frequenters for the breakfast menu. I feel at home. Good service. Decent food.

It’s a trip to the Park Plaza again on this Saturday to treat my bro, who told me about dropping in there for dinner. We had went out to a movie and after the show the first thing on our minds was to find a good place to eat. Luckily, I remembered what my brother told me and I drove down to K19 right away. The dinner was fantastic. The place is awesome. This Saturday, I’m going there once more. The place rocks!

It was quarter-past-ten (if I remember correctly) when we came here for a quick bite. We ended up in spending no less than one hour filled with some of the best delicacies that I have come across. Needless to say, I’ll be back at K19 Park Plaza very soon (who knows, maybe even tonight, while returning from a party).

Big thanks to my colleague Saumya for telling me about the K19 at Park Plaza. Honest, I was extremely apprehensive. Luckily for me, I had the good sense to visit the place one evening while coming home from Tantra. The idea was to have dinner with my wife not in a dhaba which are the only option at such late hours – A good one, because of the food and ambience.

MID NIGHT BUFFET - it's really not as great as it sounds. Food is very average. Continuas heating has totaly spoiled the taste & flavour. Very basic buffet not worth of money. 
NO LIVE COUNTER AT MIDNIGHT BUFFET.
Midnight menu is quite boring. No indian sweets after a buffet with - Alu karela, Borar tarkari etc etc pure indian dishes. 
The staff is quite cold.... even with only 3 of us dinning. No spoons are either layed on table nor on counter. overall not good experience

I had an awful experience last night in the midnight buffet.Luring people at 50% discount and serving them with left over foods from various outlets is not expected from a hotel of this repute.Me and my wife went there to get a value for money deal,but was totally disappointed with the quality of the food served in the buffet.Right from the soup which tasted like a sea water to the desert which has the stinking sponge,all the items are the left over of the entire days food from different outlets being presented well and that's the only thing it seems you are good at. If you cant give good food at this rate...at least don't fool customers like this.

Visited 2 days back and amazed by the ambience of Park Plaza. The environment was really soothing to all. K19 was on 2nd floor.
Wonderful place to be but one thing which didn't please me at all is the behaviour of the waiters. They were like laughing among themselves and were behaving very lightly which is not expected at a restaurant of this stature. Went for the dine-in buffet there and the starters were not at all impressive. The fish finger and all were really not good. Chicken soup was decent. The main course was better though. What I found really interesting is the varied choice of deserts. Those were really fabulous. So, the buffet was good. What is needed to improve is the quality of the employees there :) Thanks K19.

It is situated near Pantaloons Gariahat, a part of The Park Plaza Hotel. We had Watermelon virgin mohito, Cream of tomato soup, Chicken ravioli, grilled chicken with bbq sauce and a tutti fruity. The food was quiet delicious but they took a long time to serve. So if you want to enjoy some time chatting with friends and family and not in a hurry, it is a great place.

Live telebhaja counter in the Poila Boisakh lunch!

A buffet spread consisting of about 50 plus items, mostly Bengali and Punjabi dishes.
Majority of the foods were very average with a few exceptions of innovative dishes like “Bacon-Watermelon Salad” and some very tasty dishes like “Kanchalonka Murgi” or “Dhaba Gosht”. Nevertheless, the ingredients of all dishes were fresh.
With the glass walls, high ceilings, bold colors and lavish sitting arrangements, the ambiance and décor of the restaurant was comparable to many contemporary five star restaurants. Service was prompt and table attendants were courteous. Not all of them, however, had full knowledge of what’s being served in the menu.
The restaurant published the special buffet menu in Zomato couple of days back showing about 80 items. It was natural to think that all of those items would be available in the menu. But later, only after starting the lunch we realized that the published menu was a superset and actually they were serving just a fraction thereof. So, please do not think that all of the published items would be served in the buffet.
The hotel had underground parking available with Valet option as well.
Lunch was Rs.999+Tax per person, which seemed a little on the higher side considering the options and taste.
They charged Rs.150 (+tax) for each 1 liter bottle of Bisleri, in addition to the buffet price, which was exorbitant in any standard.
Overall, a good place for lunch (or dinner) with family or friends if you want a “Good Looking” restaurant with a five star like feel. But for this price range, there are better places in Kolkata. But not all of those will serve you this many Bengali and Punjabi dishes.

What a fabulous breakfast buffet!!! Best till date.
Everything here is absolutely freshly made and delicious.Having a sweet tooth my favorite is chocolate cake which is soft spongy and gooey with a lot of chocolate chips... Yummmmm....
Veg and non veg both are included in the breakfast buffet. I can't give a full 5/5 because of its cost. It is highly expensive as all good things come at a cost and so does this buffet.
Do try if you can notch up your budget a little .
Have fun foodies.

Nice place and good ambience . very well mannered staff . The set up was good . I went for a spaghetti and fresh lime at the beginning . The pasta was good but yes not to like eat it on the last morsel .  The fresh lime was normal . At the end went for the cheese cake that was out of the world .... My friend went for the grilled chicken she told that it was amazing .. <3 
Good place for formal dinner and all . Not a great place for chilling . A bit overpriced

Three of us went there in an evening and ordered Ravioli, lasagna and club sandwich. The Sandwich and the lasagna was very tasty. unfortunately the ravioli was underdone and so was tough, although i must say the sauce was awesome.The garlic bread was good and served warm. 

On informing the staff about the ravioli they offered to replace the dish but as I was already done eating they did not add it to our bill. Thank you K19 for the consideration shown. We appreciate it and will remember it.

The ambiance is very good, which is expected from it being a Luxury segment restaurant. It has an open kitchen and tandoor which gives the customers a barbeque feel,you can c the barbeque flames at times. Food is amazing. We had ordered mustard sausage preparation, which the chef suggested us and it was finger licking good. Perfect place to have a lovely dinner with friends and family.

The ambience of the hotel is amazing. The starters are served from the live counter.  Taste wise the food is not that great. They have a very wide range of menu in buffet. The sweet dishes are the best part. However, nothing here is finger-licking-good.  Over all a good place, but won't recommend it to people who have sensitive taste buds!

Early morning breakfast in k19.  Stayed in the hotel for a business trip. Breakfast is well spread and very well classified. Some hotels add too many stuffs in breakfast. This one is optimum. Proper classified as per American or continental or Indian breakfast. 
Loved the food, ambience is great and service is super class.

This is the most overrated restaurants I've been to.  
The food quality is so pathetic that none of the staff took care even after repeatedly telling them how cold the starters were. 
Everything at the buffet spread appeared stale, except the desserts.  This was my first and last visit to this All day dining restaurant. 
Would not suggest it to anyone. Is absolutely not worth the price!!!

K19 is a great place to start your day.
The buffet breakfast is one of the best this side of town.
A full spread with food for almost everyone. For the rest the eager team and chefs are more than happy to help.
Yet.... I couldn't give them a 4+ score.
Can't pin point why but something was missing.
It wasn't the quality of food or the freshly brewed coffee... I think it was the bakery items ... the cinnamon roll and Danish seemed not so fresh. That doesn't take away from them as most 5 stars serve one day old bakery stuff....
Conclusion, great value for money, specially when bundled within your stay at the Park Plaza.
A solid 3.5/ 5

Revisited this morning.... 
A special mention for Ayan , our server,  love his energy and enthusiasm. 
Seems as if the management and team read the review yesterday...
Everything was amazingly fresh and we'll laid out.... full marks

Cool blue drink was too good. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was nice.

Had dinner while staying here during my recent trip to Kolkata. I ordered a risotto for dinner which was decent. Very expensive though.
The b'fast buffet was strictly ok and had very few options. There were no chicken sausages or waffles or pancakes. The Sambhar was terrible. They need to have a better menu for b'fast.

Went there on a Sunday night dinner. It is located on the second floor of Park Plaza. The best part about K19 is its convenient location and decor. Its a spacious restaurant where you will never feel constraint for space. We went for a buffet. Number of starters is low though that is very much covered by the good variety of salads and variety of breads. Best part of the buffet was thin crust pizza which they served from the live counter and soup. Main course was OK, with no chicken gravy to go along with mutton biryani. Big disappointment was deserts, though they had number of items on the list but conventional items like gulab jamun and ice cream were badly missed.  All in all, its a must visit for those who want to experience more European style items in a buffet.

Sunday brunches will always be a pleasure if you visit this place. Good ambience with amazing live music was the icing on the cake as we tucked ourselves into the lavish spread. The gosht biryani was amazing. So were the chaat counter and dessert section. Service was okayish but good food helped us forget the not so good service. A must visit if a really good and lazy Sunday brunch is desired. ;)

The buffet is here is not just yummy, but a treat to watch. Set out in a spacious area with a great ambience and a look at the varieties served, can make you drool. Buffet hosts more than 30 delicacies but the best parts are salads and deserts. Especially the veg salads are too good to be ignored and desert will surely bring out your guilty pleasures.
Overall it's worth spending here for a sumptuous meal

K19 is perhaps the perfect place to drop in on Sunday if you want good food in a great ambiance and the spread to be.. well, endless! 

The first thing that catches your eye is the near perfect calm ambiance with widely separated tables, fresh white hues and live background music. Pair with that the endless spread from chaat to cold cuts to salads to breads to live pasta counters to kids section to breads to mains to desserts! Phew! You name it and its there!

I went ahead and sampled most of the things on offer and though some were downright simple, some of the dishes did click. The cheese platter was really good. Nice variety and fresh popping flavours. The fried chicken from the kiddie counter was also quite good. Other things that really left a mark were the mutton biryani. It was light with really succulent soft pieces of mutton. Just couldnt have enough of it. Also good was a certain mushroom dish in the mains. 

But what really stood out were the desserts! Be it the kiwi cheesecake, the fresh fruit gateaux, the baked rasogolla everything was absolutely spot on! The doughnuts and other desserts from the kiddie counter werent that good though. 

The things that were really disappointing would be the kebabs and other starters that were served on the table. They were all pretty dry and didnt taste right. Also I felt quite a number of dishes gave more emphasis on presentation rather than on taste.

Overall K19 is THE place to drop into if you want to kick start your sunday with a gastronomical extravaganza that is well unending..

Conveniently located inside Park Plaza near Pantaloons Gariahat, one of the best places in Kolkata for a late night munch, especially when your Smoke Shack session has been interrupted by an untimely downpour. Even otherwise, the buffets are awesome, the staff very cordial and the ambiance very calming. Wont burn a hole in your pocket - much less than what this place warrants.

We had visited this place for a sunday brunch a few days back.Located in Garcha in the lane off Gariahat Pantaloons this is a simple yet sophisticated place.The k19 all day dining restaurant stands out in terms of its soothing laid back ambiance which I felt was just perfect for a sunday brunch.

Coming to the food,firstly I was amazed by the buffet spread. It contained almost everything starting from chat corner to cold cuts to children specials to live pasta and pizza counters to the elaborate biryani and chinese to some delectable desserts and drinks. The presentation of the preparations were also attractive. Hats off to the buffet spread.

Among the items that I managed to taste,the cheese platter,the chats and the cold cuts section deserve a special mention in the starters section. The thin crust pizza was fresh and quite nice. In the main course, the mutton in the mutton biryani was soft succulent and impeccably well cooked. But the rest of the main course could have been far better.

Coming to the desserts,the chanar payesh and the kiwi cheesecake were wonderful. The cheesecake was quite sublime. The doughnuts looked appetising enough but failed to live up to its appearance. 

Among the drinks,the sangria was decent and they had a white wine based cocktail called the Yellow Angel which i absolutely loved.

When you are having a huge buffet you cannot expect everything to be brilliant and here also some of the stuff,the main course in particular could have done with a bit of improvement. But overall we were satisfied with our meal and left happy and content.

I have a membership with Park Plaza hotel but I barely visited it once. Yesterday, I took my mother to lunch at K19. The Decor is eye catching. I especially love the prosthetic trees planted there. When we reached K19, we were greeted warmly by Jaya at the welcome desk. She is Ms Sunshine, always smiling. We took a seat near the window. I also noticed the photos of modern Kolkata lifestyle panelled on the walls. Our Maitre de Table was Ratan, and he was very alert to our requirements and comfort. He spoke to my mother as if he had known her for a long time and she immediately felt easy. We took sweet corn vegetable soup, nans, pasta, green chilly chicken, fish paturi, plain rice and dal, mutton rogan josh, fresh fruit cake. The paturi was a bit bitter due to mustard. Rice was white with long seeds and separated, and dal was ok. We loved green chilly chicken. The pieces were soft and juicy with the right amount of heat of chilly. The rogan josh was also delicious, the curry light and tasty and the pieces soft. The soup was warm and delicious and not heavy or filling like the regular soups we taste in other places. The cake was full of fresh fruits and delicious. I loved pasta with its right amount of white sauce, even my mother who doesn't like pasta loved it. Lastly we ordered for a black coffee for mother and sweet lime juice for myself. The black coffee was too heavy, but on complaint they soon brought warm water to dilute it. It was accompanied by crunchy cookies. My sweet lime juice came in a large glass without any straw. It was a huge amount and after the heavy meal, it was difficult for me to drink it all up. But the taste was good, with the right amount of sweetness and no sickening sweetness. The washroom is a bit too far away from the main restaurant but it was clean and nice smelling. After food we were given lemon water to wash our hands with, but no toothpick or spice. Nevertheless, it is a lovely place and the food being delicious, and the staff well trained, I won't mind going there again.

Went there for the breakfast buffet on a Sunday! The spread was decent if not good. The ambience was nice along with service which was amazing! The food was okayish... Nothing tasted great! Being among the top hotels in the city they should work on the taste of the food they offer. 
On hearing god reviews from my fellow food bloggers.... Had tried their aadhi food festival. The food there could not meet my expectations too. Breads turned soggy, meats were not well marinated. Would avoid dining here.

EXTREMELY EXTREMELY disappointed with this hotel.....I visited the place with my family to enjoy the so called "STREET FOOD OF KOLKATA....". Hoping to get the actual street food that we have grown up with, but ALAS....they made their own version of street food, which was no way near to the real street food of Kolkata. To be very honest I felt cheated.The quality and taste of the food was not worth the price...its too high. The price would have been worth had the taste been good.....Let's come to the service, again a disappointment....very very slow....we had to wait too long for our food to arrive...and that too not the entire order together...it was coming in installments.......it seemed that they were not ready to handle the orders........very amateurish.....THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE STANDARD OF A FIVE STAR HOTEL.....IT WAS SHEER MOCKERY.....DO NOT WISH TO GO TO PARK PLAZA HOTEL AGAIN.....Giving 1.5 for ambience and decor.

i had seen an ad in the t2 about the street food festival and had visited this place two days back. i found myself in a buffet scene costing 1500/- including street food! they said that they have street food in a la carte before 7 pm and after 7 pm the street food is part of buffet. the tariff was steep (as compared to flame and grill buffet) but, i felt that the display looks impressive and so, i settled in. but, i was deeply disappointed! the street food ad was misleading! there is NO satyanarayan park ka phuchka or lake ka phuchka or victroria ki jhaalmoori or camac street ka pavbhaji etc etc ....the original vendors are not there (like you see in t2 city centre carnivals). the street food is made in-house at the hotel! the ad is just to mislead us and make us think that we will be getting the original stuff. the pavbhaji is insipid and so is the jhaalmoori! the phuchka water is laughable! what rubbish! and the main course had no paneer item. the naan / roti takes ages to come. the bread counter is just for display. (the only plus point were the desserts). steer clear of this place if you really understand food or street food or want a value-for-money buffet. however, the place and the kitchen does have potential to improve. i hope the management has the wisdom to wake up and correct itself. the people of kolkata are not fools. they cannot be fooled by misleading adverts and lured by sub-standard food. t2 should also look into this and not partner with eateries who publish misleading adverts.  [ i rate their street food at 0/100. i would have rated this place 10/100 for the desserts and because of the roomy spacious dining space and good display - i would have liked to up my rating to 25/100 but, at this steep pricing of 1500/-....i am forced to give them a 0]. if you are a real calcuttan who understands phuchkas and jhaalmoori and pavbhaji - you will be forced to agree with me and share my emotions. i felt cheated. i felt ashamed that i went all the way to garcha to taste this insipid street food at this price. shame!
PS: the desserts were surely good (but nothing OTT). but, i feel that some of the reviews below have been planted by the hotel management.

Lets begin by saying .... I'm amazed at how they managed to create this quaint hotel at a place like garcha. And the pristine blue coffee shop that's very soothing to the eye .

The minute I entered the place it stole my heart . The beautiful and soothing ambience is just perfect for a brunch and I decided that we should go there for their brunch spread on a Sunday .

The spread is mind blowing . Simply fell in love with the cold food and the chaat counters .the stir fry station made a low oil stir fry and it was mind blowing . It was one of the better chicken reshmi kebabs and the wafer thin crust pizza was brilliant too .

If you have kids .... Do bring them here . The children's buffet was luring some older ones too.

Overall a brilliant experience. Currently they are having a Kolkata street food festival . You must try that too.

Cheers !

As an ardent fan of a good buffet, headed over to K-19 for a sunday brunch, and was dazzled by the sheer size of the splendid menu. They have a great deal of food on offer, with plenty of good food, and I thought the mutton biryani was excellent, with very soft mutton. Also,  a mixed mushrooms dish stood out, along with a lovely, light chicken and farm vegetable soup,  the cold cuts, ham salad stuffed in banana pepper, chicken salad with beetroot, a fantastic kiwi cheesecake, among the things on offer. Definitely a place where you should space out your meal and eat as much as you can.

As a frequent visitor of Kolkata, I have stayed over at Park Plaza, Ballygunge almost every time and with that stay comes the complimentary breakfast buffet and this is a review of my latest visit here.

The restaurant is located on the first floor, which is quite funny as I press the Level 2 button in the elevator to get here. The restaurant is quite spacious and the tables are decently apart. The food counters are well organized and the wait staff is readily available. There are TVs around the restaurant usually with the news channel on mute.

The breakfast buffet is a mix of Continental, North Indian and South Indian dishes along with fresh preparations from the live counter made to order. I usually start with fresh fruits and in this case they had Papaya, Watermelon, Muskmelon, Grapes and yes, Mango, because summers are here! The fruits were almost evenly cut, juicy and of really good quality, except the Mangoes which seemed slightly old and not as flavorful. But I was quite refreshed after my fruit intake and ready for the baked goodies.

I had one portion each of the Fruit Cake, Marble Cake, Classic Doughnut, Chocolate Cupcake, Muffin Bread, Blueberry Croissant and Puff Pastry. The muffin, croissant and the puff seemed old and hard. I wanted to leave them but I usually don't waste food unless it is terribly bad. On the brighter side, the cupcake was the winner among these items while the cakes and and doughnut were fairly decent.

I was approached by one of the wait staff for my requests from the live counter and I asked for a Plain Cheese Omelette and got pretty much what I expected. Bang on! Soft on the outside, creamy on the inside. It was served with a grilled tomato which did a better job than tomato ketchup.

After the omelette, I decided to have some more of the continental items and got myself some Chicken Sausages, Poached Fish, Rosemary Baby Potatoes, Tomato and Cheese Sandwich, Meat Cold Cuts, Baked Potato Wedges, Baked Beans, Roasted Vegetables with Pesto, Strawberry Yogurt, Chocolate Pudding and Toast with Strawberry Jam and Butter. My top picks were the sausages, baby potatoes, baked beans, yogurt and the classic toast, jam and butter combination. I am a die hard fan of the Chocolate Pudding they serve and always put it on toast and bacon together to create the magic in my mouth but unfortunately the bacon wasn't there on the menu this time.

By now one must be thinking how much more could I eat and the answer to that is "a lot more than you can think". I now wanted to go Indian and first went North with Chole Bature and Aloo ka Paratha with Butter and Dahi. The paratha was stuffed nicely and the pickle and dahi made it a killer combo.

And finally, I went on to the good old South Indian stuff. I got myself Idli, Mysore Bonda, Upma, Mini Uttapams, Sambhar and three types of chutneys - Coconut, Tomato and Coriander. Now being a South Indian and growing up on food made by my mother, it won't be fair to compare this food with that taste. But I must admit they did a fairly decent job. The Sambhar and chutneys were quite good. Although, the bondas should be called Savoury Booris, as Mysore Bondas have a different texture and are much bigger.

Finally, after all the eating, I was absolutely full and quite content! It feels really great when you walk out without paying. Of course, I was paying for my stay but complimentary food is happiness!

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 3.5
B. Ambiance - 4.0
C. Service - 4.5
D. Wait Time - 4.5
E. Value for Money - 3.0 (If I had to pay)

With an overall score of 3.5!

On closing note, the breakfast buffet quality has gone down a bit over the last one year but is still alright. It can definitely get better as I have had better food at this place.

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a wholesome and varied breakfast buffet in Kolkata but one can look around for other interesting options, at least for now!

As a frequent visitor of Kolkata, I have stayed over at Park Plaza, Ballygunge almost every time and with that stay comes the complimentary breakfast buffet and this is a review of my latest visit here.

The restaurant is located on the first floor, which is quite funny as I press the Level 2 button in the elevator to get here. The restaurant is quite spacious and the tables are decently apart. The food counters are well organized and the wait staff is readily available. There are TVs around the restaurant usually with the news channel on mute.

The breakfast buffet is a mix of Continental, North Indian and South Indian dishes along with fresh preparations from the live counter made to order. I usually start with fresh fruits and in this case they had Papaya, Watermelon, Muskmelon, Grapes and yes, Mango, because summers are here! The fruits were almost evenly cut, juicy and of really good quality, except the Mangoes which seemed slightly old and not as flavorful. But I was quite refreshed after my fruit intake and ready for the baked goodies.

I had one portion each of the Fruit Cake, Marble Cake, Classic Doughnut, Chocolate Cupcake, Muffin Bread, Blueberry Croissant and Puff Pastry. The muffin, croissant and the puff seemed old and hard. I wanted to leave them but I usually don't waste food unless it is terribly bad. On the brighter side, the cupcake was the winner among these items while the cakes and and doughnut were fairly decent.

I was approached by one of the wait staff for my requests from the live counter and I asked for a Plain Cheese Omelette and got pretty much what I expected. Bang on! Soft on the outside, creamy on the inside. It was served with a grilled tomato which did a better job than tomato ketchup.

After the omelette, I decided to have some more of the continental items and got myself some Chicken Sausages, Poached Fish, Rosemary Baby Potatoes, Tomato and Cheese Sandwich, Meat Cold Cuts, Baked Potato Wedges, Baked Beans, Roasted Vegetables with Pesto, Strawberry Yogurt, Chocolate Pudding and Toast with Strawberry Jam and Butter. My top picks were the sausages, baby potatoes, baked beans, yogurt and the classic toast, jam and butter combination. I am a die hard fan of the Chocolate Pudding they serve and always put it on toast and bacon together to create the magic in my mouth but unfortunately the bacon wasn't there on the menu this time.

By now one must be thinking how much more could I eat and the answer to that is "a lot more than you can think". I now wanted to go Indian and first went North with Chole Bature and Aloo ka Paratha with Butter and Dahi. The paratha was stuffed nicely and the pickle and dahi made it a killer combo.

And finally, I went on to the good old South Indian stuff. I got myself Idli, Mysore Bonda, Upma, Mini Uttapams, Sambhar and three types of chutneys - Coconut, Tomato and Coriander. Now being a South Indian and growing up on food made by my mother, it won't be fair to compare this food with that taste. But I must admit they did a fairly decent job. The Sambhar and chutneys were quite good. Although, the bondas should be called Savoury Booris, as Mysore Bondas have a different texture and are much bigger.

Finally, after all the eating, I was absolutely full and quite content! It feels really great when you walk out without paying. Of course, I was paying for my stay but complimentary food is happiness!

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 3.5
B. Ambiance - 4.0
C. Service - 4.5
D. Wait Time - 4.5
E. Value for Money - 3.0 (If I had to pay)

With an overall score of 3.5!

On closing note, the breakfast buffet quality has gone down a bit over the last one year but is still alright. It can definitely get better as I have had better food at this place.

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a wholesome and varied breakfast buffet in Kolkata but one can look around for other interesting options, at least for now!

k19 is in 2nd floor of park plaza,5 mins walk along garcha lane following the pantaloons-mirch masala trail.the restaurant impresses with its nifty interior,glass facades,a patio like terrace and an adjacent lounge,the nirvana,with a giant buddha.It was afternoon and they had an option for “small buffet” at 899/-which had two veg and two non veg items(fish,chicken) and two desserts(gajar ka halwa,and an assortment of fruits and cake)
we decided to go for ala carte.the risotto was very nicely made,aroma  enriched with prawn.the ravioli was less stuffed than I had hoped for.New york cheese cake was a delectable savory.theyalso  serve you bread on table with tartar sauce gratis,but we were too filled with all “cheesy” stuff to partake of them.
Next time i will try out their dinner buffet.

K19 buffet breakfast is one of the best in kolkata. Lunch is an average one and dinner is very ordinary. The variety of liquor in the bar is very limited. Even regular brands like teachers and black dog are often found unavailable. The score is mainly because of the awesome breakfast that we have had here.

At Park Plaza Ballygunge Kolkata, I went for a dinner at K-19 where I liked the kesarbadamkulfi the most. The creamy texture of the kulfi having an authentic flavor of saffron makes me recommend it.

Situated in park plaza prime location great amazing interiors.
Big inside with good sitting arrangements and very attractive for family audience .
I had a buffet they do keep changing there items so it is difficult to comment but my experience was  the food is average yes many salads good deserts but main course items don't click me that i will say yum yum.
On the whole its a good place but needs to uplift its food.
Buffet is not that expensive menu cards items are little expensive.
Its situated in a 5 star rated park plaza but doesn't live up to the food its offering
Attendents are good.
You can try it not with family may be with your wife ir girlfriend.

Bullshit! Mind it! I have never used this term for any restaurant till date.
I went for the Lunch buffet and it was pathetic.
Stale, completely stale Biriyani. I just lifted the lid and the irritating smell filled the lounge. And the staffs were denying the fact that it was last day's or maybe last week's biriyani. 
To the Manger, please understand the fact this is a world where media holds the power and customers are not fools that you will feed us with any shit you prepare. The association of Park Plaza with Raddison is an insult to the outstanding brand.

But I must add, that the service was great. The waiters were wonderful and finding our hateful response they did prepare fresh biriyani and pasta and yes they didn't charge for anything.
By the way i must add that my dad is a Prestige Club member of Park Plaza and it was his birthday. The day went off pretty bad. Thanks to Plaza. 
Well, they claim that their dinner buffet is better. Whatever it maybe once you fed us with smelling Biriyani. Do you think that anyone should ever come to your restaurant again? I am sure that I would have suffered from stomach poisoning, had I tasted that piece of shit.

Value for money is what comes to mind when I think of this quiet place tucked away in the Ballygunge area. We went for the Sunday brunch albeit a bit reluctantly. We as a family, prefer continental food and were not too enthusiastic about this place at first. The warm starters came to the table while there was the usual array of cold salads and breads in the centre island. There were three starters, fish, chicken and baby corn. Along with unlimited beer, it could have been an entire lunch by itself but....there are those who need their rice/roti/bread for lunch. So there was a lavish spread with fish in lemon grass, veg lasagne, mutton biriyani, chicken tikka masala and a host of other stuff. After that were the desserts...the coup de grace! They were delightful little cups of joy! There was a raspberry panna cotta, a tiramisu in a cup, a coffee mousse, a key lime tart and a few more items that tasted as good as they looked. So all in all, worth spending some time on a Sunday afternoon. Did I mention the live jazz music playing in the background? It was soothing and not loud. There was a vocalist who showed up at 2.30 but in my opinion it was too late and we had to give it a miss. They should start the singing at 1.30 and not an hour later. I give them 8/10 and will surely go back.

Decor good.Staff courteous.Service very slow.
Tables and furniture broken or damaged with no one to check.
food very bad.We were there yesterday.We had there their buffet breakfast.Would never ever go there again. It was pathetically bad as if have been made on a road side counters.even they are better than what we had in park plaza.The idles were hard and the chantey below average.They served us vegetable pakaros which were also very bad and again much below average.The juice glasses were big but the juice served was of no taste and was very thin. the fruits were awful and smelling.I request the owners and the head of the staff to immediately take note and improve the quality or else somebody who goes there once shall never come back again.I am giving my number because if any one from the management can contact me if they want to do so.9831415243

This place looks and feels top notch. From the white interiors to the food, everything is fabulous! The staff are courteous.

I've only tried the dinner buffet here. Their bread section and dessert section are amazing! The amount of variety they have is pretty noteworthy. I was missing a sweet bread but that's fine.
The starters didn't impress me much. The pasta in red sauce did not really have that tangy kick. And the cheese pasta tasted the usual. I was disappointed a bit when they couldn't serve pizzas on the day. The tandooris were decent. Nothing wow!
The main course had a wide variety and was very tasty indeed.
The desserts were outstanding! Not only did they have a huge variety of deserts, but each and every one of them tasted exceptional !
I was surprised to see that they didn't serve donuts in their dessert section, considering the variety in breads they served.

The Columbus feeling.
It so happens that you suddenly find out a brilliant place to eat in an obsolete place in South Kolkata while you are a resident of Salt lake.

We ordered Asian Noodle Soup and Thai chicken in red curry. 

The Asian noodle soup was more authentic. It was bland with the apt vegetables. 

The thai chicken was the surprise. It was purely thai, strong enough to attract me to the place again.

The decor was extravagant. More because from the outside you do not expect it to be such. The Nirvana Lounge is my next stop. It is by far the most architecturally spectacular lounge in Kolkata today.

A below average buffet for the price. I visited this place on one evening in August 2014 along with my in-laws since they have Park membership that offers them 50% discount across Parks. The restaurant had dazzling & creative decoration along with the rest of the place and gives you the instant feel of a multi-starred hotel. Also the restaurant staff was very very helpful and cordial apart from being courteous, reflects the class of the place. Coming to the buffet menu I must admit that they offered a bounty of choices which itself would take more than an hour if you want to taste each and every item individually. The buffet was standard multi course with startup soups, bread sticks, tandoor and chinese starters and even North Indian vada and chat where I liked the concept of giving all the ingredients for you to make it as per your taste on your own. The soup was indeed very good but the starters were average in taste. The starters were served on the table and also had Pizza that had a bit hard crust even being thin. There were plenty of options in the main course and also the dessert section (some desserts with indeed very appealing presentation) but I hardly think a single stands out in terms of taste that can bring out the wow factor that makes you think "I want to eat that again and again". I do not know how best to make this review a more of a constructive feedback rather than a blunt criticism but if I have to think like an average food loving Bengali person I would compare this Rs 1400 priced buffet (which we got at around Rs 700 applying membership discount) with the same offered by restaurants like Bar-B-Q Nation or Mainland China which costs near around the same (Rs 700 to Rs 900) or even the buffet lunch I once had at Hyatt (Rs 1200+) and all of them were leaps and bounds ahead of this in terms of taste of food and value for money. I do not know if this restaurant is targeted for the in-house guests or the Park members primarily but if Park wants this to be popular among external customers who wants to spend an evening over some good food then the value proposition of the offerings in comparison of the competitors has to be revisited sooner than later. Perhaps my expectation increased several folds by the price but I would still love to see the Park tag shine. Even my dinning experience of the Park in Park Street was way better than this one when I had visited there about a year back, although that was strictly ala-carte ordering and not buffet.

Lastly, although not directly related to the food, no matter how nicely the front-door security folks or those engaged in valet parking are dressed and paid they do not leave any opportunity of "salaam sir" to get "baksheesh" for bringing the car just 20 feet along from the side parking to the main entrance. This place was no different in this aspect unfortunately. May be its just me but what is disgusting remains to be disgusting.

The rating of 2.0 is for the decor and the wonderful floor staff of the restaurant but not that much for the food.

Terrible terrible terrible breakfast I just semi ate out of hunger. Staying at the hotel and dreading I won't have time to go out to eat breakfast  before work tomorrow. Cold congee probably just taken out of the fridge and served.  They probably don't know that food warmers don't heat food they just keep already hot food warm. You can't fish things out of the fridge and put it out on the warmer hoping for a miracle. Arrived at 6:40 to get b/fast over with before work- nothing was out. At around 7:15 the breakfast is still not fully out and I just left. The baked beans were terrible. I just ate a bit of aloo dum which was still edible. The so called luchi wasn't even fried at the right temperature. my husband tried the potatoes- the potatoes were probably from last week again cold. Watermelon juice was also fermenting so were some of the dressings at the salad bar. We just went on tasting things hoping that something would be good so we could fill our bellies before heading off. I soooooo hope I can forget this experience. Never seen so much disrespect for food. Check out the so called Brie from yesterday, day before and probably a piece fished out of someone's plate. I understand cutting costs but be decent about it at the very least.

Was visiting Kolkata on a business trip and happen to visit this coffee shop for a business meet in the late afternoon. The hotel belongs to the Carlson group and me being a Carlson member knew that the property would be good. The 1st impression was that not a soul was present in the entire restaurant - looks like they have not marketed the property well.2nd impression was that the interiors were pretty decent and were disappointed that no one was bothered to usher us in and make us seated. We,therefore decided to seat ourselves and waited for good 15 minutes for them to come up with menu cards and water to be served which was annoying.
We were 3 of us and we all ordered for 3 different dishes and all were not available even though we picked the items from the menu. The staff were looking least interested and their tag line for any and everything was " we do not have at the moment" Well,ok, since we all were hungry and asked them to tell us what is available and we settled for Aloo tikki chat, along with a cup of tea. They served us after about 20 minutes and believe  me, have never had such a horrible tasting char which was not edible at all. Having said that and no where to go,we continued our meet with little choice. Overall, a very bad experience in terms of food availability,quality and top it with horrendous staff.

Wen u enter d hotel, u will luv d ambience, its beautifully dun.. We were in a grp of around 15. I had made an advance booking n already informed dem dat  it will b an anniversary party, d guy hu tuk d booking was very gentle n polite, he was really welcoming, promised an awesome experience and a complimentary cake too. After all dis u definely feel assured dat u will hv a great party but to my dismay d pathetic service spoiled our mood completely. We had taken buffet which was a very elaborate one. They got d pizza, pasta, babycorn n paneer tikkas and kept it on d table but din serve it. Water glasses were not filled. There were no plates. Saucer size small plates were dere. We kept wondering where to accomodate d pasta pizza tikka,etc on dat tiny saucer. We were embaressed. Dere were no waiters around to whom u can call n ask for dishes. Finally I had to go to d other side of d restraunt and insist dem to c dat dere are attendants to d table. Things improved slightly. (note: only slightly). We were made to sit in 2 tables as we were in a large group. Wen we asked for chat masala, I requested to give dat on d other table too. The guy kept arguing dat d quantity of d chat masala was sufficient n we can take n pass to d other table and ultimately din serve in another bowl to d other table. 
I had to repeat atleast 3 tyms to repeat each item. We kept asking for ketchup, dat too was served after d pizza got finished, after begging for 5-6 tyms. 
White sauce pasta was horrible. It was boiled pasta in milk. No veggies, no herbs, no taste at all. Never in my live I hv had such pathetic pastaz. Even d ready to cook Maggi pasta tastes a 100 tyms better.
Whenever we asked to repeat d starter dey were so reluctant n ignored so many tyms, looked lyk their bosses had instructed dem to ensure d orders are not repeated, if so, its menu price will b deducted from their salary. Heights of utter cheapness !!!
Den we headed to main course which was so-so, d fruits n salad counter was almost empty. We asked dem to refill it and we kept insisting but dey kept saying its coming. Finally our dinner got over but d fruits n salads were not refilled. Till den my guests got really furious. All spoilt completely. Cuming to desserts, d website said dey hv 9 variety of desserts of which dere were only 6. No ice cream even. So its all bluff and inflated on d websites n all.
All in all it was a pathetic experience. They literally spoiled  ever our party. Such an amzing  n such poor service!!!! Shameful!!!!
I insist pls recruit better ppl so dat dey spoil ur image n reputation!!!!!

Driving around gariahat at 1 in the night, decided to visit K19 for some pastries and it was a decent experience.

K19 is the 24 hour restaurant of Hotel Park Plaza located in garcha lane. The restaurant is huge, spacious, well lit and pretty comfortable. The staff are very helpful and warm. The hotel is a  5 star so rates are bound to be high. They have a midnight buffet as well which seemed decent for a 500 bucks at that hour. 

I tried the new york cheese cake that was pretty good but the star for me was hazelnut and choco delight which was just amazing. It was well flavoured with hazelnut and the pastry had the crunch due to layers of french biscuit, highly recommended from my side. Warm chocolate fudge cake was highly disappointing and very mediocre. The cake was small and dint taste that good to me. It was just about edible with the chocolate sauce and vanilla alongside. At 325 + taxes, they were all just about average except for hazelnut one.

K19 is a non-smoking restaurant, located on the second floor of the Park Plaza hotel. Good interiors and nice ambience inside but 5 star feeling was missing. Service was pretty good especially friendly staffs. Sitting arrangements were comfy and nice. K 19 serves Oriental & Mediterranean cuisine with a focus on the culinary styles of Indian cuisine, specialty kebabs and Indian curries. Their live kitchen allows guests to enjoy interactive entertainment while dining. 

Their buffet dinner spread followed the well-established template of 2 each of Veg and Non Veg starters and a fairly elaborate main course spread comprising a host of salads, Indian curries, Pan Asian selections and a bevy of desserts. The numbers of options are both daunting and enticing.  After trying soup, I started from the delicious kebabs which were my favourite set up of the night. Both chicken kebabs were nicely done and tasted great. 

A variety of traditional garnishes including chopped egg, onions, cheese and lemon were available to create unforgettable flavour profiles that please every palate. The Indian and Oriental mains were pedestrian at best especially paneer & chicken items. I tried their all desserts and the biggest disappointment came in the form of the desserts all of which, with the sole exception of the Berry Frangipane Tart, were markedly below average. 

All the items barring a few were done to death and they need to work on bringing some innovative stuff to the table. The desserts surely need much improvement and better selection. You can visit the place with the family and surely it would be a good diner.

Today we again had our lunch in Park Plaza, 2nd time in 2015. Park Plaza is located in a prime location - Gariahat. The all-day dining multi-cuisine restaurant, K19, serves Mediterranean cuisine with a focus on the culinary styles of Indian cuisine, featuring specialty kebabs and Indian curries. Today we went for Indian delicacies. K19 is a fine dining restaurant that is swathed in warm white and beige hues that lend to a comfortable dining experience as you sample a variety of exotic and traditional dishes. 

Armchair travellers don't need a jet plane to go all over the world. Foodies don't either; all they need is an appetite. Today we had started with ‘Cream of Chicken’ soups. Cream of Chicken soup taste decent and had nice aroma. Now for starters we went for ‘Tandoori Fish Tikka’, ‘Chicken Tikka’, ‘Dahi Bara’ & ‘Creamy Salad’ followed by ‘Blue Lagoon’ mocktails. Fresh cooked Chicken Tikka tastes awesome but Tandoori Fish Tikka tastes just heavenly. Tandoori Fish Tikka, slowly melting in my mouth with right amount of flavour & spice, it made my mood for main course. 

For main course we ordered ‘Badshahi Polao’, ‘Dhonepata Murgi’ & ‘Vetki Maach er Kalia’.  Vetki Maach er Kalia was too good, perfectly made. I just can’t stop eating it. I also liked Badshahi Polao as it went well with fish kalia. Dhonepata Murgi gave me a shock, it taste very average and I think chef was thinking of something else while cooking it or may be vetki maach er kalia was so tasty it over power the taste and flavour of dhonepata chicken. 

Finally in desserts, ‘Nolen Gur er Rosogolla’ was so soft it just melts in our mouth, flavour of nolen gur not only increase the taste it also made the dinners bit passionate about it. ‘Black Current’ pastry was also enjoyable. We finally had ‘Fresh Lime Soda’ after the meal. All in all satisfactory lunch in a nice peaceful place.

I went there yesterday for my birthday. We had the Sunday Brunch. To describe the experience in one word would be FABULOUS. They have an option between pizza, pasta or 2 veg and 2 non-veg starters. Since we were 9 of us some went for the pizza and some for the starter though we shared. Both of these were excellent. The starters were made fresh and we had unlimited mocktails and hard drinks as well! The main buffet was also quite elaborate with both veg and non-veg items. The deserts were of supreme class.

Altogether it was a "Fantabulous" brunch and I highly recommend this place to all. :)

K19 is the 24 hours in house restaurant of the fairly new 5 star hotel Park Plaza. The hotel is situated in the lane beside the Gariahat Pantaloons. Pretty odd place for a 5 star. My friend got through to a job in Bangalore and we were looking to try out a new place to celebrate :) 
The Sunday brunch here seemed to be a good deal. The brunch at K19 included liquor along with buffet and we instantly zeroed in on this :P 

Ambiance: The restaurant is on the 1st floor of the property. The entrance to the hotel does not exactly make u feel that you are in a 5 star property. It looks a bit toned down. Valet parking is available and the staff was very warm at the reception. We took the elevator to the 1st floor and entered the restaurant. I found the interiors of K19 very classy,  dominated by white and has a very swanky feeling to it. We were instantly greeted by the staff inside and seated at a table of our choice. Being a Sunday I did not expect the place to be empty but then we were the only guest at that point in time. 

Food : As decided we opted for the brunch. The spread was huge. They even had a make your salad section. We knew that we were in for a treat :D. In beverages they were serving Miller beer (pint), Signature (whisky) and some brand of vodka which I do not recollect. There were two variants of soup (one veg and one non veg). Both of them were average to taste. Starters included Paneer tikka, Crispy chili potato, Chicken nuggets and chicken reshmi kebab. The paneer was really fresh and I loved to gulp them down. The crispy chili potato was also very well made. The sauce perfectly blended with the potato wedges and the crispiness was perfect. I found the chicken nuggets very average to taste, though the chicken filling was solid and fresh. The chicken kebabs were very juicy and succulent and we enjoyed the starters a lot with the drinks. 

They had a variety of salads on display. Atleast 10 variants of veg and non veg (chicken, bacon, etc) salads along with make your own salad section and a chaat section. We also made a alu chaat by ourselves :). Papad was also served on the table on request. After this we came to know that they also have a live counter and they serve pizzas/pastas on request. We immediately ordered one chicken pizza and one chicken pasta(Spaghetti) in mixed sauce. The dishes arrived in a very short amount of time. The thin crust pizza had insufficient cheese topping and was very dry to taste. We did not like that much. But the pasta was yumm. The sauce tasted awesome and had generous amount of chicken. After all this food and few round of drinks we were already full but then the entire main course and dessert section was untouched ! 

In main course they had dal makhani, navratan curry, mixed vegetable (Chinese preparation), veg noodles, chicken biryani and mutton curry (dont remember the exact name of the preparation). They were also serving indian breads (Naan, Tandori Roti) at the table on request. The dal makahni tasted excellent, one of the best I had in recent times. The biryani was just okay, the mutton tasted simple but the mutton pieces were soft and well cooked. We were really full by having all this food but we could not possibly miss the desserts. There were around 7-8 types of desserts on offer from cheesecake to chocolate cake but surprisingly there was no ice cream ! There was a strawberry based dessert which tasted awesome. I did not like the cheesecake though. My friend really liked the chocolate cake. 

Service: Service was top class. The waiters were very courteous. Water was served in wine glass which looked very classy. 

I really liked the brunch here and I feel that it is a very good deal if one wants to enjoy a laid back Sunday brunch along with alcohol at an affordable price. The Sunday brunch is priced at Rs 999 (all inclusive). The service is nice, ambiance is great and the staff very polite. Parking is also not a problem. Would definitely come back for more !

Enjoyed a fantastic evening here couple of months back. The service is on point from the moment you walk in the door. The hostess (or host) is really friendly and when you sit at your table you are greeted almost instantly to start your dining experience. The contemporary and sophisticated decor of this place is definitely a big plus.

We started off the evening with Dry Martini. The cocktail was exquisitely superb in taste,  setting off the evening on a good note, and carrying on to be a great companion to our main dishes. Although this place does not have a wide range of cuisines, but I guess this is a no-nonsense, smart & professional restaurant which allows you to indulge yourself into delectable food without much hesitation or confusion.

For appetizers, we went with the Asparagus cream soup and chicken caesar salad. Both of these were presented beautifully. For our main dishes -by recommendation of the server as well as our own contemplation , we went with the Tenderloin Steak and oven baked kolkata Betki. The latter one was just wow - flavorful, tender and delicious.

We finished off the evening by sharing a NY Cheesecake dessert. The presentation was slightly sloppy however, taste and consistency wise, it was rich, decadent, and sinfully delicious. 

The service was genuinely sweet, attentive and professional. Overall, it's totally worth it!

I would love to come back again !!

We went there for the Lahore Food Festival after reading the reviews in T2. It was a lunch choice cause we were really excited about the food and the cuisine. Unfortunately to my great disappointment and embarrassment, they had no Lahore kebabs or any of the specialties that afternoon. To make things even more worse there was a section in between the entire buffet spread that had chinese food. The buffet menu was totally disappointing and not upto the mark and it was a total washout in terms of expectation. Next time I visit a food festival I will ensure that I atleast try it before taking colleagues/ guests along with me. We enquired about the absence of anything authentic in the lunch buffet and they said that the menu kept changing, which was understandable provided something authentic from the cuisine featured in the festival spread.

Heavily over hyped...Food quality is okay only but the standards are not at all great !!! The service is superb and the staff courteous...

Tried the Cream of Mushroom/ Tomato and Veg. Manchow soups...the masala papad served was soggy due to overuse of lime/ lemon...Starters were just fine...

The Dal Makhani and the Rotis were superb...the other veggies not worth mentioning !

I have been frequenting K-19 in recent times. I generally like the vibe of a coffee shop and that is one of the reasons I frequent this place because I ambiance and service are both great. Had visited last week with friends and while two went for the buffet two us us decided on the A La Carte. The buffet on that day was simply boring .... yes the Pasta , Pizza , Veg and Non Veg Starters were pretty good but the main course of the buffet just plain lacking in variety.  The two of us who ordered from the menu  opted for the Risotto A La Gamberoni which was quite nice. I ordered a Chicken Burger which was just about average. The Chicken Patty was much smaller than the bun it was enfolded in and quite hard though not bad to taste and the bun itself was dry and a bit stale because it just crumbled in my hands. The desserts in the buffet section were quite nice as per the feedback my co-diners gave me and my friend ordered a Kesari Rasmalai out of all things that she raved about and said was super. I feel that a good burger and club sandwich are the staples of a Coffee Shop so I  sincerely hope to see a better quality of burger next time as well as greater variety in the main course of the buffet. Service was excellent and fairly quick so no complaints there.

----- 16 Nov, 2013 -----

K-19 at the Park Plaza is a great place to grab a bite .... contemporary  and chic decor , great service , an open kitchen concept which I always like and its not too crowded all make for a superlative experience. Stopped by for a quick bite last evening on route to a movie and was not in the mood for the buffet though they had a good spread on offer. We ordered a couple of club sandwiches and the Ravioli di Pollo with smoked chicken and mozzarella cheese for our main course. The Club Sandwiches were superb , generously loaded and all the ingredients fresh and perfectly prepared ... really good stuff. The Ravioli in terms of taste and quantity was very good though the Pasta itself was a bit hard and rubbery and I hope that its a one off thing. For dessert we ordered the cheese cake which was lovely though they used a bottled raspberry sauce which was not bad but did not measure up to the excellent quality of the cheese cake. What was the letdown was the Kulfi Falooda which was quite tasteless and icy. The management when we pointed this out was kind enough to immediately offer to replace it with a dessert of our choice but we had a movie to catch so did not take them up on their offer. Service was good in particular a young gentleman called Avik who went out of his way to take care of all our requests. This is one place I will be visiting often !

A new property, hence the service quite upto the mark.

Did a buffet over the week at this coffee shop. Very limited menu. Good quality food. Suggest the management can increase the price and have an elaborate spread. End day it's a five star right ?

Kudos to the initial service team, the staff was very friendly and forthcoming

Not as great an experience. Though food was good, service was horrible. Staff crunch was cited as a reason! But my family dinner could not be as great as it could have been, that is all a customer will care for! No staff to attend when you enter. Had to look around again and again for someone to attend. Had lot of hope from this place. Highly disappointing!

One of the finest Buffet option in Kolkata.
Situated in a plush new 5-star hotel, Park Plaza, in Ballygunge, (near Pantaloons), the look of the restaurent, named K19, inside the hotel is very stylish, with a white decor.
The spread is endless. Mainly consisting of continental fare, it is a mixed bag, with Indian dishes, little of Chinese, and cold live salad counters, pastas, breads, etc.
The best ending I have had in recent times, the dessert counter is just mind-blowing-pastries, sweets, gulab jamuns, halwa, the list and varieties is endless. I am a sewwt lover and the spraed is a feast for the tummy and the eyes.
The spread is enough to bowl any food lover, leaving him with desires to come back for more.
Worth every penny, and certainly worth repeating.
Highly recommended.
Score 5 out of 5.

A swanky and fine restaurant where i see myself going often since its located close to my residence. Beautiful decorations- indoor and the outdoor. I came across this place on zomato and decided to go there with my friends for their  Sunday brunch. I made the reservations and the team that greeted us on entering the restaurant was an absolute delight. Super courteous, polite, well mannered staffs and manager. Service was bang on time. On requesting they even served us the main course which usually doesn't happen in a buffet. So  In short it was a perfect day out with my friends. Cannot fault the place at any point and i do hope it remains this way in the future too.

Now the food: Buffet spread was great.The starters, the pasta in white sauce, chicken, the biryani, everything was well prepared and tasty. The desserts were mind blowing. I am a big fan of sweets especially pastries so it was a huge treat to my tummy and my eyes. 

I will definitely recommend this place. One can go here for casual or fine dining. Just go , relax and enjoy being served with smiles all along.

Even though we eat out very often and like to go new places,decided to try K19's Sunday brunch ,restaurant was packed with foodies and they have a nice looking live kitchen too.we were welcomed and taken to our table very courteous staff and were well attended in such busy buzz.Chef went out of way to make us special chicken preparation out side the buffet dishes.There hot buffet has quite a diverse spread with more than 15 dishes to choose from but we liked the thin crust pizzas made to order and pasta the best we had.

over all a great Sunday outing would recommend to all for ~value for money~

K19 a newly gift  to food lovers in Kolkata like me my family and my friends . Last  week i have been there 
with my family and I tried the food of coffee shop which is k19 , in a nutshell  I just  can say that the 
food was marvelous.  We tried a three course meal like tomato shorba,  bhatti ki paneer , pudina 
neza, subz soyeta, aloo dholakia, even we tried the  pizza which is undoubtedly amazing. Though 
they are offering  Multicuisine  food ,but their indian food  is also amazing. We found the buffet  
spread  was also immaculate, vast choices of food and  service is also very good  excellent food keep it 
up..
i will make sure recommend it to my friends and family members...

The recent hype in town about this new five star property – Park Plaza and its restaurant K19 - caught the fancy of my wife and as the weekend approached, we planned a dinner there. The buffet menu sounded really tempting and we went with a lot of expectations. 

However, I was reminded of the saying “All that Glitters, is not Gold” within five minutes of me taking a seat in the said restaurant.

The property is no doubt attractive and located centrally as well as designed tastefully, inside and outside. However, the only thing that was running in my mind from after five minutes of me taking a seat in the restaurant to taking leave from there was – when the owner has spent so much on the prime property, what stopped him from spending a bit more on hiring people who are good at their job, are thoroughly professional and in tune with the hospitality business, especially in the star properties. 

I was directed towards a nice cozy table of two upon entering by the assistant manager, I suppose. 

And, that was the last time I was excited and in a nice mood for the rest of the day.

Generally in a buffet dinner, starters are served at the table and that is why I was waiting. 10 minutes passed by after I settled and nobody came to attend and neither the starters came. Perfectly fine - It takes time to make fresh food.

But, another 10 minutes passed by and nobody came and neither was I given starters or even water for that matter. I had to call a waiter, who all were too busy serving the air hostesses to have noticed us. He asked us to wait a while and so we did. I and my wife had a lot to talk so we tried too hard (in a mutually subconscious way) not to give away our weekend mood, if you know what I mean. The waiter serving us couldn’t speak English or even Hindi properly. 

So, we entered around 8.10 PM and finally our first round of starters came at 8.35 PM. And, guess what?

The plate had two pieces of Panner Tikka and the mint chutney was not in a separate mini bowl but was instead lying next to the tikkas. (Like many of us have at home) Five Star? Eh!!

Now, the question was two pieces or the way the chutney was given. No problems, we are flexible. It was swept off within 20 seconds, so I asked the waiter to get me more and it was another 10 minutes.

This time he brought 4 pieces and there were two small potato cutlets, which were twice the size of Polo. I asked and the waiter said only two starters are there and I was surprised but guessing it is very much possible didn’t dived further. (Later, I came to know that there were many other starters too and I am not able to figure out why I wasn't served those). Anyways, that was the end of starters for us.

It almost felt like they don’t want to service us or trying ways by which people can have less on a buffet. Ok, understood. 

But, almost one hour for 6 paneer tikkas and 2 cutlets? I will suggest the manager to go to Barbeque Nation for a learning experience. It would almost be an eye-opening experience, a revelation and Nirvana for him and that too at half the price.

We gave up hope on starters and went for main course. We took the subzis, all mostly the same items you would see at any other buffet across Kolkata. No problems. We took the vegetable curries and went back to our seats and waited for the breads to be served. Another 15-20 minutes. Our curries by then had the temperature similar to desserts. After  giving up hopes that waiters will ever come to serve us as they were too busy with air hostesses and a couple of bigger groups, I called upon the assistant manager and he managed to serve me breads after 5 minutes. 

Our mutual effort to keep the mood nice and in weekend mode was finally destroyed and it was hard to pretend and not take it out after that. 

The last attempt to eat something, just because we had to for basic biological needs, was when I asked the waiter (who I finally had to shout to call upon) and order a pizza that was included in the buffet spread. It was served too promptly after all that to my surprise but my joy was short-lived as there was not even a shred of vegetable in the “Vegetable Pizza”. I thought maybe this is one of those Italian Pizzas with only cheese. It needs mention here that no Oregano or Chili Flakes or even Ketchup was given along with the pizza. Basically, it is upon the mood of the waiter to decide, whether to serve you or not to serve you in the way it is supposed to be.

The waiter gave the Pizza and ran away as if almost mumbling “Take it or leave it”

I went for desserts after that, which all had different colors but same flavor, except for a couple of items which were good and thankfully so. However, as I came back to my seat, I saw the people sitting on a couple of tables around me are having Pizzas too and that Vegetable Pizza had vegetables (they were having the same buffet spread too). And, yes I forgot to mention that the cocktails I ordered while having starters came just before I was going to finish my main course. My wife ordered for Mango Delight but was given Strawberry something something and we didn’t complain as we were pretty much used to it by then. 

In the desserts section, they had a live Ice Cream Counter like in Cream and Fudge Factory and The New Zealand Ice Cream shops (those machines with cold surface used for mashing and mixing the ice cream). But, there was no one out there to assist and I am sure the guests were not expected to do it. Anyways, we skipped the ice cream upon seeing that and with all the waiters too busy to notice me standing at the ice cream counter, I just didn’t felt like irritating myself further by again calling upon the waiter.

However, I did call the waiter afterwards to complain about the difference in the quality of Pizzas being served to us and the others, why only two starters were served, why the breads came late, why the cocktails took half an hour, why no garnishing was given along with Pizza and so on and he almost gave up the smile after noticing that we understood what had just happened. 

Noticing that, I called the manager who sounded apologetic but mostly listened to me just because it was a part of his job. I guess staff there were in a hurry to serve the bigger groups and bevy of air hostesses there, who were lodging at the hotel itself I believe.

I have been to many restaurants in Kolkata including five star properties like Hyatt, Park and Taj but this kind of service is extremely exceptional on every level in the negative sense. 

I urge the foodies to brace themselves for one of the worst dining experience if you are going there. 

Or, maybe it just wasn’t my day.

The place is average, i was disappointed with the hotel overall, did not seem like a 5 star property, moreover the food was okay. I took a dinner buffet, spread was good, but only half the items were good. You may try going there for once but don't expect too much.

I stayed at this hotel for a night and it was a lovely experience. Great ambience, lovely interiors and above all, lovely food. I tried pasta and it was superb. The nirvana lounge is also a great place to chill. A must visit at least once

Give their a-la-carte items a try as buffet options are limited & choices are ordinary; like- Manchurian Chicken, Kolkata style mutton etc.
In starters, they hasd scanty choices. Paneer tikka/ chicken tikka :(
Their sausage salad must be xceptional. Coz- this is the only sausage item, my companion could take up; otherwise he simply hates sausages. 
Chicken in Crispy noodles salad & Mango mousse are worth mentioning. 
Interior is incredible. Can't believe such a wide & cozy lounge could be situate in hastle-bastle of the heat of the city. 
There's a huge Buddha idol- which a baby in our group, mentioned to be 500 tmes her size...and yes! it's that huge. :)
It should get atleast 4 for its decoration.

K19 All Day Dining. It is a swanky restaurant in Park Plaza - The Newest Five-Star Property in Town.. It is located in Garchha Lane, Ballygunge in the same lane as Mirch Masala.

The interiors, predominantly done in white and silver with splash of color here and there with the help of food, along with the brightly lit lights, is strikingly good. The seating is very comfortable, too. I've been wanting to try it, ever since I heard that it opened, and hence there I was yesternight for dinner with my friends.

Coming to the food,

Soups : Tuscan Minestrone was the best, followed by Asian Noodle Soup, Cream of Asparagus and Cream of Tomato.

Starters : Aloo Dholakia, Akhrot ki Tikki and Tandoori Gobi were Good while Tandoori Mushrooms, Broccoli and Veg Malai Kebab were Okay.

Oriental : Schezwan Noodles, Singaporean Noodles and Manchurian were all too good :D

Main Course : Dal Makhani, Subz Dum Biriyani, Vilayati Subziayan were good in that order. We had it with Butter Naan, Garlic Naan and Masala Kulcha which were good too.

Pomodoro Sechhi Se Asparagi Con Formaggio Di Caprino Risotto was yum.

Mocktails : Virgin Strawberry Daiquiri was the Best while Blue Lagoon and Orangle Cooler were Ordinary.

Desserts : Every Dessert was Amazing. But according to Preference, 
Hazelnut and Dark Chocolate Delight with Creme Anglaise and French Biscuit
New York Cheese Cake with Vanilla Wildberry Sauce
Warm Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Gelato
Tiramisu.

The service was awesome and the presentation of the food is laudable.

Considering that it is a five-star restaurant, the pricing is quite moderate.
It would set you back for about Rs. 1200 per person.

Overall, it was a super experience!

Four and half stars from me :)
