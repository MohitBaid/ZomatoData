It's a very small actual dhaba type restaurant - less spacious, plastic furnitures, no air conditioning. So you may not like the ambiance but the taste of food served is really good, specially taking about the Chinese delicacies. The chicken at the Chinese portions was really good and succulent, great in taste actually. Chinese mixed rice was little on the oiler side but it had immense bits of chicken and shrimps and tasted nice. Price is very very reasonable considering the quantity and quality of food served.

What we ordered - Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Mixed Fried Rice, Lemon Chicken (semi gravy), Schezwan Chicken dry.

Wow, Mr Brajesh, Apne dookan ka khud review de rahe hai.

The hotel is good, but too much business mentality, there is one black tall guy with big eye balls, thinks he is the owner, but he is no one, for him only customers are leaving the hotel, being a regular customer I left the hotel for his attitude only.
