The place has come down from ots former glory. Be it the sweets or the snack, the taste is blunt. It now serves mainly as a local joint rather than a place of fame

A small place opposite ram mandir which was once famous for big kachori and sabzi but has detoriated a lot in recent times. Very few items are available and that also not up to the mark.

Very tasty and spicy snacks and delicious sweets. They also serve north indian thali called ghar jaisi thali which was also good in taste. The best part is you get all the sweets and snacks in budget price. The owner was little rude but their staff was very friendly in quick in service.

Small and effective... Good sweets spicy snacks and most importantly effective pricing.

Must go deal... Should visit or carry snacks packed for home... People nearby knows the point

This is a small restaurant located opposite ram Mandir near girish park that used to serve some quick snacky items earlier but in recent years has also started serving proper north Indian food n thalis and at pretty reasonable rates.

The place is small with a few tables and is best suited for grabbing a quick bite or a takeaway. The place is clean and the food seems very hygienic. I have not yet tried the meals but the samosas, radha ballavi are pretty good. The dhoklas are average and the chaats are decent. Overall good food at very nominal prices and I am optimistic about their north Indian meal as well, hope to try it soon !!
