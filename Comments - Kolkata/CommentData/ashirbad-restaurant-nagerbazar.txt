Very ordinary & average food joint. It is an A/C resturaunt but a/c will not be operative if the no. of customers are low. Service is however quick but the quality of food is poor. Waiters not even know to take payment through cards with a plea that the card is defective. Very poor experience. Price of food is not high but appears to be high ib terms of quality and test of food. Better not to visit here to waste money.

Went to this place a lot during school times..For friends' birthday treats. From this, it is understandable that the place is very very cheap. Though the restaurant offers a lot of dishes but the food is nothing extraordinary. There's negligible decor and the ambience is so so. But the waiters are very well- behaved and the service is good. Though the food isn't extraordinary but the price is so less that one wouldn't regret dining there. This place would suit people who eat out a lot and doesn't want to stress their pockets.

Went here today. Quality and quantity of Food was above average. Nothing special in it. The only thing which astonished me is that they don't have Biriyani and tandoori chicken. On asking they said "sir ses hoa geche" which is a complete lie as we went there around 9.30 p.m. So without any option we have to order chicken fried rice and singing chicken. The only plus point is the price of the food is inclusive of tax.

The restaurant is at a perfect place, near the Central Jail busstop. The ambience is homely. The waiters are well-trained. Food doesn't take much time to be served. The prices are inclusive of taxes and won't take tolls on your pocket. Overall, it'll be a nice experience for everyone.

P.S.- Don't expect tartar sauce to be served with fish fingers as that has been removed due to lack of demand.

The cooking style & tastes are good. Ordered Kashmiri polaw, Murg Hyderabadi & Chicken Punjabi masalla. The quantities are not huge but moderate. The worst things gone was, they misguided & served Palak Chicken as Murg Hyderabadi as tried to convince that Murg Hyderabadi is always made with palak. Pocket pinch is standard.

The reunion of our college buddies after a long time at Ashirbad Restaurant became successful due to their awesome ambiance and deliciously served food. The quick service of the staff members was another noted specialty of the food court. 

Our gang decided to try out some signature dishes of the place by ordering- Green Salad, jeera aloo shimla mirch, sahi paneer, kashmiri pulao, butter nan. My personal favorites among the above mentioned dishes were the sahi paneer and kashmiri pulao. The soft and juicy pieces of Paneer will easily melt in your mouth by leaving the flavor behind. However, the other dishes we ordered could have been a bit better in flavors.

No bar...but I found some good things..fst of all their mix gravy noodles...yummy..and also just 110 bucks...chicken Indian recipe... R so so ..but spiceless...roti r soft...biriyani 's taste bad...but..their tutti frutti ice cream... What a cute presentation... Not so professional.. But I like it..what I lyk most...the restaurant was almost empty in afternoon and early evening...so that you take some food..and spend a lazy time with your friend s or loved one...no one disturbed you..and also..they not take any tax or vat....

It is a good food joint at central jail bus stop on jessore road. Though a part of a guest house, the food is really good in taste and quantity. Presentation is simple in the interiors but they do decorate it during festivals and new year. The staff are well behaved and the ambiance is quite. The price of the food is reasonable. Food here is like home cooked food  but tastes better. They serve Chinese, mughlai and north indian. A good family restaurant overall. O have visited the place with my family quite a number of times on different occasions. They also provide indoor catering services for small parties and get togethers. They also provide buffets during the durga puja season.

I have tried their soups and other behaves. Except soup all are not up to the mark. The Mixed fried rice contains only 3 pieces of prawn and full of vegetables and less chicken. Day after day they have reduced their quality. I have visited this place many times. They give enough quantity but quality is not that good. But one good thing in this restaurant is they do not charge extra tax. Their tax are included in the menu chart. #Mixed_Fried_Rice #Crispy_Chili_Baby_Corn #Ashirbad

First of all I am quite satisfied with this restaurant that is near to my place. I visit this place from my school days.. the food quality is really nice and the ambience is also good. The people who serve food have a genuine good behaviour. Most of the time I do order chicken hakka noodles with garlic chicken because that's my favourite. Last year I even celebrated my birthday there with my family. Last but not the least chicken sweet corn soup, veg polau and kadai paneer is also a great combo.

2nd review: ordered chicken tikka kabab, chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala. It costed 400 fr two people. Quantity was enough for two of us. Items are good..not awesome. But happy to get this in this cost. Found little piece of bones inside kabab which was little annoying. Biriyani was nice.

To start with the ambience its got an average decor. Staff is humble and polite. Food is quiet good. Its satisfactory nothing to die for. Comparatively its Chinese is much better than its North Indian. Simple food that tastes good. Its mixed friedrice tastes good. Cost of food is really genuine. They give really generous quantity. If you wanna save your pocket as well as enjoy a good meal then rush to this place. Overall a good place to visit.

This is one of the decent restaurant in my locality and so my review of this place can be a bit biased. It's a spacious joint and very neat and clean and because of the area this place is never crowded. Me and my mum often visit it as it is pocket friendly and serves good quality as well as quantity of food. We generally order breads and Indian side dishes. I have mostly tried all their chicken dishes and I must say they are very good in taste but their Chinese preparation is okay not that great. The soups and starters are also good. The last time we went we ordered sweet corn soup, hot and sour soup, chicken tandoori full, 3 butter nun,chicken bharta and murg tikka masala. As I already said the soups were nice and the chicken tandoori was not the authentic one but with respect to the price they were charging it was not disappointing. The naan and the other chicken dishes were absolute yum. The total bill amount was 700 (it is damn cheap) The other Chinese starters are not great but compared to the price that they are charging I don't think one will have a room for complaint. The best part they don't charge any vat.

One of the lesser known restaurant in the region I was always reluctant to visit the place but last night decided to have my dinner and I was surprised in a good way.
Ambience is not something that you Wil remember but it's not bad either it's some what Ok but what it lacks in ambience is covered up by the service and the quality of food provided. 
The service is excellent and the food provided is of very good quality when compared with some of the well known restaurants. The price is also very light on your pocket which is like a topping on your cake.
I would definitely visit the place again. Also any one who wants to taste good food should come to this place and I m pretty sure you won't regret.. Cheers ;)

We ordered and food was served in 15 min.. Fresh and yummy food.. We ordered Tikka Kabab , Ashirbad Special Pulao and Spicy Punjabi  Chicken  Masala.. Food taste was awesome.. Kabab was so good that almost melting in the mouth and salad accompanying kabab was good.. Ashirbad Special Pulao tasted special and it went well with spicy Punjabi Chicken masala..

How literal can you get with the name??? To all the frugal foodies Ashirbad is like the greatest boon ever. 
Location 
------------------------------ 
Bus stop: Central jail ; oppostie the petrol pump ITS pretty easy to find. 
Brief
 -----------------------
 I have seen this place from its making.Seving Indian, Chinese cuisines this place according to me is a standout among close competitors Maharaja and Debonair.A good place to give your birthday treat. The prices are extremely low. 
Ambiance
 ---------------------------- 
The place is spacious. Never that crowded. So there is no problem finding a seat. It can accomodate large groups and the dim lighting is sure to set customers in a good mood. 
Staff ---------------------- 
Never had any kind of issuses with billing or misbehaviour. Only once they did mistakingly serve crispy chilli chicken instead of crispy chilli babycorn. The otherwise meek polite staff vigilent as they are serve quite fast. If not fast not slow either.. you know what i mean ;-)
 Food 
----------------------- 
Now where do i start . I have eaten here so many times i almost lost count. 
The quality is quite good i'd say especially in relative to the price. But i must admit they do wobble a bit as far as consistency is concerned. But many a times they pleasantly surprise you with one of the best dishes you have ever tasted. 
On one such occassion i had the privilage to taste their Chicken Butter masala . TILL date i havn't had anything near its comparison . But sadly next time i went the dish wasn't the same anymore. 
Lets sum up : Do try the chicken butter masala you might get the good one The crispy chilli babycorn is super tasty ( so is the crispy chilli chicken) Now i once tried the chicken chow and it was suer tasty so you dont wanna miss that. Ooh there are a lot of things cant cover all like this One caution you might wanna stay away from the paneer dishes. Rest is all good .

 Here comes the best part you can feed 7 people to their full and the bill will come no more than 1000-1200 One more instance would be ....Where else can you get mixed fried rice for 75 bucks ????
 So u now have an idea of how low the prices are . As for me this place is on my permanent visit list. See you next birthday Ashirbaad :-D:-D:-D:-D 

Suggestion 
------------------------- 
IMPROVE YOUR CONSISTENCY
 overall

The restaurant stands right opposite to Central Jail bus stop. The ambiance inside the restaurant is good with the tables spaced adequately. The service is prompt as well. The food could have been way better than it currently is. There are hardly any must-tries I can think of currently. The pricing is reasonable, though I have had better food for similar prices elsewhere.

This place is located just opposite to my school,so I have great memories here. The first time I went to some restaurant withh friends was in ashirbad. The food is good,prices are moderate. A drink called micky mouse previously priced at rs. 35 is my favourite! Now I don't find it on the menu somehow. The stairs outside ashirbad is also the place where the mothers sit and gossip,waiting for their wards to come out from schools or tuitions. The students from our school Stephen's also visit the place for bday treats and other celebrations!
