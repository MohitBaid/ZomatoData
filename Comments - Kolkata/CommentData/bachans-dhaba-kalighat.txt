Had been to this famous food servers near kalighat and i had an okayish taste of the mutton biriyani that i had ordered. Found it dry. I liked the taste of chicken bharta along with tandoori roti. I feel personally I got a better taste of the same food that we had at more or less same price from other restaurants. Ambience was not what i liked as the floor was dirty.

Went to Bacchans Dhaba today to end the week with some punjabi tadka....starting  with
 
Decorations-3/5.This is bcoz once u enter a dhaba the typical punabi dhaba atmosphere was not created properly
Staff-3/5.The politeness and courtsey level needs to be taken care of.The manner of speaking was very poor.One needs to call a waiter 3 times for ordering  food.
Food-3/5.We ordered butter masala kulcha which was really amazing.Then we had  chicken bharta,mutton biriyani and finally ending with sweet 
lime soda.Mutton Biriyani  quality  was very poor didn't expect such poor quality rice was not cooked properly  I could feel that the rice was needed   to be  boiled for some  more time and the potato was too hard there was no feeling of juice inside it.Chicken Bharta was okay just needed to be cooked in bit less oil.Sweet lime soda was just fine.
Overall this restaurant doesn't deserve a visit again unless there is no option left.

Ordered from here some time ago. The chicken tikka kebab was okayish. Have had better in other places for the same price. We had ordered chicken tikka kebab , chicken reshmi kebab, Rumali Roti and chicken Bharta. The reshmi kebab also I felt could have been better for the price. The kebab pieces were very small. The Rumali Roti and chicken Bharta was good.

Ive been here to this place with my friends. It was my friend's birthday treat. I liked the ambiance of the place. We ordered for Butter nan, Chicken bharta, biryani, salad. The order was taken right away but it took ages to get served even though one by one. The services and most importantly the staff behavior was very disappointing. The food quality is good. 
We even good free coke with biryani as it was a combo offer. 
It was overall a good experience.

It's a place near Kalighat metro station close to lake mall..it's famous for its North Indian dishes...it has two seating arrangements...the upper one is with AC and the lower one is Non AC...we ordered chicken tandoori as starter and tandoori roti, veg tarka and chicken tikka butter masala as main course...the veg tarka is delicious and the chicken tikka butter masala is mouth watering...at last ordered for kulfi as dessert...the kulfi was awesome in taste... everyone should try this kulfi... almost pocket friendly joint...the place is always crowded more or less...

Bachan’s Dhaba  is really a quick bite centre in southern Kalighat 
Just 2 minutes walk from Kalighat metro station this place provides a good wholesome hearty food both Mughlai and Chinese 
Now this is a really fast restaurant you would not expect to be a fine dine in restaurant 
They have a lot of good tandoori items from the range of chicken to mutton  
Don’t. Get upset there are also veg hell lots of stuffs
I did not dine in there Moreover take away from that it Restuarant

On 25th  after a long day out we went for this place for dinner. Having heard a lot about this place I was quite eager, but was really let down.  As the place was crowded we had to wait for sometime to get a place to eat.
Since it was a family dinner, we ordered mutton biriyani and reshmi kebab full plate. After 15 mins we were served, the briyani was hot but didnt taste good...it was bland, the rice was not properly cooked and the mutton was too hard and not properly cooked. The only good option was the kebab, it was common in taste but properly cooked and we could actually eat it.
Being a foodie and having heard so much, this experience was quite disapointing.

When your pocket is not that heavy, but you do not want to miss on some delicious food, this is the right place. Bachan's Dhaba provides you both a casual and a bit decorated ambience. But the food they serve is beyond words. Be it Naans, Kulchas, or be it biryani or be it kebabs they always keep you satisfied. So I should say next time you are looking for a place near Rashbehari Av., visit this.

If you are visiting during the winter try Makai di Roti and Sarson da saag , it's their winter special and yes it tastes awesome. If you are a fan of North Indian dishes be sure to visit this place. It offers great food at reasonable prices. The naan and tandoori rotis they serve are by far the best in terms of taste and softness across many restaurants.
Nice ambience.
Good service.

If you are looking for authentic dhaba style food, but in a more accessible region in the city and not on a highway - bachan's is the way to go.
They take their food seriously. I can vouch for that as this place has been a staple for our family since I was a kid. 
Last night too we were in some mood for Bachan's food but going out was not an option. So we ordered via a food delivery app and Bachan's did not let us down.
We ordered rumali roti, tandoori roti, dahi tadka, chicken bharta and chicken Reshmi kebab. It was a hearty meal for 7 which cost us an extremely nominal amount. 
The rotis were soft and pillowy even though we sat down for dinner at least a couple of hours after delivery. The dahi tadka did not have onion or garlic in it(by our request) but still managed to taste amazing. The bharta was spicy but not too hot, rich and creamy but not too oily - the perfect balance. 
The kebabs were also deliciously coated with a spiced yogurt marinade and grilled to perfection.
It was a hearty meal indeed.
Make Bachan's your go-to place whenever hunger pangs hit you. You won't be disappointed.

Went to kalighat with family.... And ofc cousins😅😅On returning we were quite hungry and probably I the most... So we saw this dhaba which is actually  on the main road of rashbehari avenue so it was quite easy to spot it... And instantly we went there.. We went up on the first floor which was an air conditioned one.. We ordered chicken biryani, Chicken butter masala, chicken curry,salad and ofc.. Cold drink.. As we were getting late my father told the waiter to be quick, and he was really quick😂😂coz he placed all the orders in almost 5mins.... The place was nice enough.... And the food was really spicy and amazing.. Chicken was very soft.. I liked that😜.. Overall it's a nice place and if ever I'm in that area and I feel hungry, I would  definitely  like to visit that once again.

I just love the tarka of Bachan's Dhaba 😍 its awesome. Last time I visited, I ordered tarka, chili chicken and two types of nun garlic nun and butter nun. All the items were quite good but I loved the tarka most may be because I love the tarka of this place. The prices are quite reasonable. It's good to give a visit once only for food. Ambience is ok for a nice dinner but may not be ideal for romantic dinner.

The name Bachan Singh dhaba makes me nostalgic . I have got very fond memories of this iconic joint on Rashbihari . Came back to this place after 10 years and I was shocked.  My dear Bachan Singh dhaba has changed . No more of those bench and tables . Now it's a swank looking place and I became apprehensive.  But I was happy to find the same old flavour in the food . Way to go Bachan Singh Dhabba . Wish you all the very best .
Of all the new things on the menu I found Biryani . So so in taste but otherwise the old dhaba style menu remains the same .

This was my first visit to this place... an always crowded food joint in a very popular place.. right on the rasbehari avenue junction.. beside the kalighat metro gate... quite easily accessible and being located on the heart of the city draws an attention of evry passerby..

It was during the lunch tym a gang of  friends decided to have our lunch.. We entered and directly opted for the ac sitting zone which was upstairs..

Food :- 1) mutton biriyani :- the biriyani was really good.. The mutton piece was huge in size and really very very soft.. in fact the bone was also very tender.. It was well cooked giving the perfect aroma of biriyani we love to have... (4.5/5) with a big aloo.. .5 deducted bcz I felt the quantity Cud have been better..

2) Chicken tikka butter masala :- 8 pieces of small boneless pieces of chicken floating in a sweet and buttery gravy... The pieces of chicken were soft and melted in mouth..(4/5)

3) Chicken tikka masala :- again boneless chicken pieces in a spicy gravy.. This dish was simply fantastic.. I really craved for more.. The smoky flavored tikkas were lipsmacking.. (5/5) Must try...

Just like the name suggests,"Dhaba" the food is exactly what we expect of "Dhaba" i.e. Tasty. Chicken is Bae😍 and this is probably the best well one of the best place for chicken. Be it chicken Bharta or chicken reshmi butter masala or any chicken dishes. 
Chicken Bharta and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala is highly recommended by me. 
Keep it up. 😍

After experiencing horrific time at Kali temple I came here (as recommended by one of my friend) to binge on my hunger. Well this isn't a heaven for vegetarians as compared to non vegetarians. My raita was extremely salty n thin. Kulcha n paneer dish was fine/good. Do not expect it to be a very clean place. Before finishing my food ... the bill was at my table that too when there was no rush n tables were empty. I had to gulp my food fast coz my waiter was standing next to my table waiting for me to hurry up! But I must admit this place gives you value for money food. This will be my first n last visit to both Kali temple n Bachhan's dhaba.

Began with Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Chicken Tandoori as starter..
Reshmi Kebab was soft but quantitatively, it was not enough.. Same should be said about the tandoori..
Though we tried Masala Butter Kulcha and Butter Nun which was pretty nice and tasty! Mutton Keema Matar, Boneless Chicken Tadka & Chicken Bharta accompanied them.. Tadka & Bharta tasted nice but Keema matar was not as good as we expected..
We ate at the AC section of this restro though there was a non-AC part at the ground floor..
Overall, this is a good place to have moghlai dishes..

I am visiting this place since my college days. Few years back they have renovated the dhaba but the legacy continues. Located just beside kalighat metro. They have two sections, ground floor is non-ac and 1st floor is AC.
I have visited this sunday to have a authentic dhaba food with my friend and they have not disheartened me. The decor was decent. As they don't serve the kebab before 4pm, so we have to jump directly to the main course. Ordered for mutton biriyani, roomali roti, tandoori roti, mutton tarka and mutton liver kasha. The food was tempting, each and every item were perfectly cooked. Hospitality was also very nice. A must try dhaba with a small hole in your pocket..

Located near Kalighat metro station, this place is absolutely awesome for college students. The place has both AC and Non AC restaurant. The AC being on the 1st floor.
The ground floor has an absolute atmosphere of a Dhaba, with all the hustle and bustle of people and stuffs. Went with my friends the place was almost completely filled. We ordered tandoori roti, chicken bharta and lassi. The food is really praiseworthy. Though the lassi felt a little too sweet for me, but it was good as well.

Pocket pinch: 300 for 2

Overall a perfect place to visit if you love Dhaba's.

2) Chicken Tikka kebab - excellent (4/5)
3) Mutton kasha - not bad (3/5)
4) Reshmi Butter masala - good (3/5)
5) Chicken Bharta - very bad (2/5) [ do not eat ]
6) Tandoori Roti - (3/5)
7) Butter Naan - very good (3.5/5) 
8)Salad

Went their with family on nabami. This place has two separate seating arrangement. Ground floor is non ac and 1st floor is air conditioned.The ground floor was too dirty ,because of the puja rush i guess. But 1st floor was comparatively clean. Decor was nice ,it had some colourful mason jars hanging and that added a beautiful touch to the place.
We ordered chicken biryani,2 masala kulcha,chicken tikka masala,1 fried rice ,kesar lassi,cold coffee and blue lagoon.
Biryani was awful ,they didn't even bother to heat it before serving.The quantity was very less ,it had one piece of chicken and no potato egg nothing.
Masala kulcha was again disappointing , it tasted some what like mushy alu paratha because it wasn't crisp at all and they didn't even add butter on top of it.
Chicken tikka masala was great. It had 8 pieces of perfectly cooked chicken in it.Gravy was creamy and nicely done.
Fried rice was under cooked .
Coming to the lassi ,coffee and lagoon. All 3 of them were equally tasty. My favourite being the kesar lassi.
Ambiance-3.5/5

It took me sometime to pen down my reviews since I want to give a 2nd visit and then only give my final verdict.  
It was during the durga puja times we had our 1st visit. The non ac place was crowdy and at the same time messy so without much thought we went to the ac place upstairs. The place was good comparatively neat and clean. We ordered mixed vegetable, chicken bharta, chicken kadai, tandoori ruti, rumali ruti and butter nun. The food was good in proportion but it was very oily. 
     Yesterday only I went to a 2nd visit and ordered tandoori ruti along with chicken bharta. This time we ate in the non ac section and realize that there is a huge difference in the price between the ac and non ac section. There is a difference of 15 to 20 rupees on even a single tandoori /rumali. Moreover they have revised the price and the price given on Zomato are not the actual price taken. The food quality and quantity is fine and adequate but service is really not appreciated since they literally come and charged for tips forcibly which the main reason behind me deducting one marks.

One of the most popular restaurants(dhabas) in Kolkata, we decided to feast on some North Indian food. The interior was spacious with it being divided into a Non-AC downstairs and an AC upstairs. The interior was beautifully lit with some Punjabi songs playing softly lending some feel of Dhaba to the place. The staff was courteous and service was swift. We ordered Butter Masala Kulcha, Rumali Roti and Mutton Kosha with Mango Panna Soda and a Coke. The Mutton was as delicious as one would like it to be with the meat seasoned and cooked beautifully. If one wants to taste some quality Punjabi and North Indian food at pocket friendly rates, this is the place to be.

Ordered food from this place. Service was really fast.

Chicken Reshmi Kebab: Perfect. No complaints.

Chicken Hariyali Kebab: Most of the pieces had chunks of fat in them - a defect not present in the other dish we ordered. The pieces of meat should have been chosen carefully.

Value for money. Will try out more dishes from this place.

I ordered from this joint today as I was craving proper dhaba cuisine to delight my taste buds. I ordered chicken tandoori full , chicken bharta, tadka and Tandoori roti. Chicken tandoori full had 4 pieces of well cooked and flavourful chicken pieces. However I felt tadka and bharta were average in taste. Roti was okayish , better than most places who serve burnt rotis. Delivery was on time and prices are easy on the pocket.

We went here at Choturthi noon during Puja. Usually at this time there was enough queue for lunch at that rush hour. When we four finally got place there the time was around 4pm. Okay coming to the point, we ordered one special chicken biriyani, veg fried rice, chilli paneer, 2 blue lagoon, one tutty fruity. Food taste was average. Prices are pocket friendly though. The place is comfy and the staffs are according to me are good.

I have been here more times than I care to count. Have had biryani, tadka, chicken hariyali kebab and chicken reshmi kebab, chicken bharta,chicken kadhai, chicken tikka masala, dal, mixed veggies ,paneer butter masala, mixed noodles,aloo do pyaza, palak paneer and what not..
Ambience- They've changed everything and it now looks pretty decent. The Ground floor which is non Ac is basic but is too noisy. The top floor is the pleasant. Overall it is loads better that what used to be earlier.
Service- Prompt but the waiters are an unlikable bunch.They're not the most polite and I had one experience where a female friend was particularly annoyed.
Food- Dhabas are known for their food and while Bacchan's food is not exceptional, its decent thought the prices are not as competitive as they used to be. Bachan's are a benchmark in quantity though, a plate of noodles, for example can easily feed 2 grown men . I was pleasantly surprised by the kebbabs. However, the biryani is not their forte. Non veg curry dishes are good but typical,the tadka is very good , mixed noodles is loaded with chicken, egg, prawn and also mutton (which some may like but I don't). Their veggie dishes suck.
Overall a place to go to if you are on a budget and are hungry. I would have given them a much higher rating but for the creepy waiters.

How did I miss reviewing this place?!
Well not too late though!Just came back having dinner here.We ordered mixed chowmein,mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice, boneless chilli chicken ,salty soda sikanji and blue lagoon.
The noodles here are my all time favorite!And they are packed with meat and prawns and eggs.
The chilli chicken was passable.
The drinks were a new attachment to the menu.I liked the sikanji but the blue lagoon could have been better!
I have grown up eating here and to see them do so well makes me happy.Now they have two stories..the upper one is air conditioned.

If you're on a budget and want to have good food then this legendary outlet is definitely the place to visit. Any South Calcuttan has been to this restaurant at least once in their lifetime. Its located right next to the Chetla exit of the Metro and very easy to spot. The place has been revamped recently and a floor added to it to accommodate the ever increasing footfall.
Last time i had visited this place we had ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Bharta, Butter Naan. Their Punjabi items are the clear prize winner and while visiting one must make sure to try out their Chicken Butter Masala and other creamy gravy dishes in which they certainly specialize. This is one of those places where quality and quantity go hand in hand and you wont end up complaining.
Their chicken tandoori is one of the best in the city. Perfectly marinated, roasted and seasoned, it is served with onions and Pudina chutney. The marination is perfectly done with masala being applied to each and every part of the chicken. 
The biryani on offer is quite good with the restaurant producing better biryani than some of the mughlai restaurants in the city. The potato was well boiled and the meat was very tender. The quantity is just perfect with one plate leaving you quite full.
Their rotis are well prepared too. For the gravy items - most of the kebab based items run out fast on weekends so visiting this place with an expectation to have the pre-planned dishes of your choice may leave you disappointed as was in our case. We had planned to have Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala but had to order Bharta instead as no kebab dishes were available. The chicken Bharta was good but I've had better chicken bhartas. The gravy was a bit soggy and the chicken wasn't tender. The seasoning was a tad bit off.
Looking forward to my next visit which will be soon enough.

Last night we ordered 3mutton biriyani & a chicken biriyani with a chicken tikka butter masala. Food was served in time but when we started having our dinner suddenly a waiter came & snatched the chicken biriyani plate & mentioned that he served the special chicken biriyani instead of chicken biriyani. So he need to change the plate. As per price taste of the biriyani is not convenient. The piece of the chicken & mutton in the biriyani is good as well as the environment.

I found this place over-hyped. I was here with my friends. We had to wait for around 10 minutes to get a table, which is acceptable in the Pujo rush. 
The management needs to improve. My friends were not being allowed to enter even though they said that we were already seated and waiting for them. We had to go and accompany them. Disappointing. 
Coming to the food- It fell way below expectations. We ordered Chicken tikka butter masala and masala kulcha. The chicken was okay. The gravy needs improvement. The masala kulcha was overpriced. 
The biryani, too, was insipid. 
All in all, this place is not value for money. Far better places around.

If you want to have a quality and tasty food without spending much,then bachans dhaba is just for you.They have non ac in the ground floor and foods are much cheaper there and is devoid of taxes.In the first floor(ac section) the prices are a slight higher and 18% tax but still it will be much cheaper and tasty as well. but they didn't have all the dishes as mentioned in the menu.infact they had only few.

Bachchan's as the name suggests have whatsoever no connection with Sath Hindusthani or Madhushala. But the food matches the quality of the either two. Dropped there on a rain soaked Sunday afternoon ordered age old plain fried rice and boneless Chilli Chicken. Interior is decent. Service is a big let down,rude usher boys never augurs well for ratings. Overall a sombre experience.

One of the best dhabas in town if not the best. My family has been one of their loyal customers for nearly two decades now. I can vouch for the fact that they serve some of the tastiest Tandoori items and North Indian dishes. My favourites are the Mutton Tarka, Mutton Masala, Chicken Tikka butter masala, Fish tikka butter masala, Chicken Tarka along with the Tandoori items. The above dishes are a must try for anyone visiting or ordering from here. The prices do not burn a hole in the pocket. Moving with the times, they recently have renovated the place giving it a smart look. You can visit the restaurant with your family or friends and you will not leave disappointed... that is for sure. 
The restaurant has certainly survived the tests of time and has come a long way. And I am very sure that they are here to stay. I am certainly holding on to them as a loyal customer, in this journey of theirs.

I have been eating in this joint since birth, as i stay a few blocks away.

the specialty was the taste but slowly the drift is very easily noted, the joint is becoming money hungry and the foodies hungry for the previous taste, the behaviour is indirectly proportional to the crowd,ie more crows increases the behaviors of the staff deteriorates.

i wouldn't recommend this like i used to do earlier

One of my all time favorite joint . If you are looking for a value for money joint then this is the place to be. The tandoori and kebabs are fantastic. But my favourite menu is roti , egg taka (the best tadka in kolkata) and chilli chicken. However I must tell you this chilli chicken is not the typical chinese and goes perfectly with roti only

Firstly, this is an age-old joint,may have existed for more than 25-30 years or so.They have renovated to keep in touch with the ever-changing world !!
Has 2 sections - Non-AC(ground floor) & AC(1st Floor).We went to the AC section.
The decor is decent, the place is very spacious and the ambience is extremely calm, soothing & just takes away all the stress left in you.Loved it !!
Coming to the food(GST is charged on the menu prices) -
1)Chicken Bharta - Very, very delicious. The quantity sufficient for 2 and just too tasty(5/5)
2)Roomali Roti - Was well cooked,quite large in size
and a nice choice.(5/5)
3)Tandoori Roti - Not too hard, just about the perfect thickness.(4.5/5)
4)Chana Masala - Tasty but had too much spice. Sufficient for 2 people.(4/5)
5)Normal Lassi - Definitely had the dhaba feel. Only thing is that it wasn't too cold. (4.5/5)
All in all, it's a wonderful place for a casual outing where food is your primary concern while the ambience compliment it !! 
But yes, the waiters are a bit of a problem since they wait near your table for tips which is absolutely disrespectful & if you don't pay that, they make expressions which can anger anybody.... 
Earlier no GST was charged but now with that, the prices too seem on a higher side.
It's a nice place but then, again the prices should be a bit less...Otherwise,it's fine.

This is an excellent dhaba! We mostly order in from this place. This place makes the best tarka! Veg tarka is worth a try. They are extremely good biriyani makers as well and can give stiff competition to the best biriyani places in the city and often win! Their tarka and biriyani are truly worth a try for everyone, every foodie. The chicken bharta could be better though.

It's my mistake to expect minimum decent  chinese foods from a Dhaba. But, when they offering Chicken Manchurian in price tag of ₹200/-, then they should kept some of good ingredients in the dish. We found 8 pcs. Cornflower quoted boneless chicken in hot araroted water(No vegetable). Mixed fried rice & mixed halka noodle was ok, but disappointing is Chilly Chicken & Chicken Manchurian. 

My suggestion to the reader, please avoid chinese food in Bachha Ji's Dhaba & go for only North Indian dishes. 

Good place, good service, decent price but worst chinese dishes.

This is a restaurant which I love to step in whenever I feel like getting a taste of authentic punjabi style tadka.. except that Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Reshmi butter masala, Kadai Chicken are also a worthy try as it satisfies the taste buds at a moderate pocket friendly price.. :-)

Lost in the city of joy on your hunt for good food at reasonable cost? Bachan's dhaba is your saviour. Situated near Kalighat Metro Station at Rash Behari lies Bachan's Dhaba. This place specialises in Indian Cuisine especially. 
Must try: Butter Chicken, Kulfi, Matar Paneer 
Cost : 450 ( for 2 approximately including tax)

It is one among the best pocket friendly places to crash in anytime. I have been having here for years and I really appreciate the change that I saw in the last few years. The eatery is renovated and has both ac and non ac spaces now. The ac space upstairs is decently decorated. The food is quite good keeping in mind the rate at which it is served.
I have had so many items that naming all will be difficult. Recently I had butter chicken, tandoori roti, haryali kabab, all of them were decent in taste. Their rotis are large but I will prefer Reshmi butter masala or Tikka butter masala over butter chicken here. Their Mutton Biriyani has large pieces of mutton and the quantity is great and it is spicy. Special mention to their Chicken tandoori. 
The staff is polite, friendly and quick.
It would be great if they start serving finger bowls at the end of the meal.

Food Quality is Good .

One Main Thing Is If U sit in 2nd floor you have to pay more for foods (prices will be high ) because upper floor has Ac ..But If You sit in main floor prices will be less ...Must Try the chicken Bharta and Paratha ...service 4 out of 5 and food 4 out of 5

This is such a place where you can drop down anytime.Easy to locate.The food is good and all at affordable prices.

The Dhaba had a great makeover with two sections A.C and Non A.C. And its clear and hygienic.

Visited this place quite a few times. Ordered Chicken Biryani as this is one of their signature dish and it was good . Also had egg tarka , reshmi kebabs, Chicken Bharta , tandoori roti , butter nun and kesar pista kulfi which was wow !! Overall great...and Do dig into this Dhaba anytime!!

This an old resturant located at Rashbehari more. Very easy to locate. Have to walk nearly 20 foots after coming out of Kalighat metro. I was by myself and hungry. So decided to get into this resturant. Although the decor and etc is not very elegantly made, the taste of the food is fairly good, which is what actually matters. I ordered a chicken biriyani. Thats all. It was huge in quantity and the chicken pieces were enormous but tender and succulent. I enjoyed the meal. Also, its fairly light on pocket.

I liked the AC restro's ambience. It's simple yet good
We ordered;
Boti kebabs. The pieces were soft, taste average.
Tandoori chicken. This lacked the strong tandoori flavour one searches for.
Veg Egg Tadka. This was really impressive.
Rumali roti. And Masala Kulcha. The kulcha could've been better.
It's worth visiting for casual but tummy filling dining.

Parceled home their tandoori chicken and egg tarka. I feel the place is overrated, the tarka was too oily and average in taste though the quantity was good considering the price. Coming to tandoori chicken, it was heavenly just cooked perfectly keeping the tenderness of the chicken intact. Extra 0.5 for tandoori chicken. 

Ambiance - 3.5/5
Food - 3/5
Pocket pinch - 4/5.

This place is located in rashbehari and is pretty close to kalighat metro. The kebabs they serve are pretty awesome. They serve quality Indian food at pocket friendly prices.
The chicken and mutton biriyani served here are plain awesome. The chicken tandoori and chicken reshmi kebabs taste heavenly. The chicken kasha and the chicken butter masala were also pretty good with butter naan. The chicken roll was good too.
At such economic prices one cannot simply ask for more.

Ordered food from Bachan's last evening and let me tell you , even though the food was delivered late and it was absolutely cold - It was Awesome !!

I had ordered for the following :
Paneer Butter Masala
6 Butter Naans
and the Tandoori Chicken Reshmi Masala 
 Naans tend to get leathery once they turn cold , but in this case they were overlooked because for one we were really hungry , secondly the swiggy guy took forever to get us the food , and third offcourse the food turned out to be excellent . The Chicken was tender and well cooked in an awesome Reshmi Masala , the Paneer was not far behind with this wonderful Butter masala . I have tried Butter masala Paneer from many restaurants but this by far has to be the best .

1 mark deducted because of the delay in the food and hence it being ice cold when delivered otherwise there was nothing stopping me from giving them 5 stars 
Keep up the good work Guys - I look forward to ordering some more and new dishes soon

Bachhans dhaba is located right on the rashbehari crossing. Primarily established for serving rooti tadka to truck and taxi drivers in the 70s, bachhans dhaba has come a long way. The tadka remains as good as it was before. They have added host of chinese and mughlaai items which you can enjoy by sitting in an ac chamber. Please dont miss the roll which is excellent. Overall very good on food quality and value for money.

Must try masala kulcha.. mutton masala , Kebabs n biryani.. 
The mango lassi was just awesome. 
Keep up the good taste always.

This place offers a good kind of mughlai and north indian dishes. 
This has always been a biriyani aided place for me. 
Fish kabab and boti kabab are real good ones here. 
Chinese wont be a good option here. I was really disappointed with the chinese they serve.

We used to go to chetla ahindra mancha for our post graduation entrance classes for MD/MS. The classes used to run for 10-12hrs at a stretch for 2-3 consecutive days with a lunch break of 45mins in between. This was our lunch destination everyday. Mostly we had fish thali, chicken thali or egg thali. It was of generous proportions with the usual combo. One day we had chicken biriyani and chicken tikka butter masala. It was the usual fare. The other day we had butter naan and chicken kasha. It is economic and tasty and filling.

Biriyani is also good in taste and quantity. Mutton fry is my favourite dish in here. After renovation it became better. As a desert kulphi in this place is just awsome.

Anyone who loves authentic punjabi food in Kolkata knows of Bachan's Dhaba. Serving good food since forever, today was no different. 

Located at a minute's walk from the Kalighat Metro, it sits right on the main road towards Chetla. With a quick service and well behaved and informed staff this Dhaba certainly is one of its kind. 

We had ordered chicken kasha, egg chicken tarka, tandoori roti, rumali roti, salad and koolfi faluda. Less than 15 minutes and we had our piping hot order served before us. 

The chicken was very well cooked and had the right amount of heat. The tarka was usual , nothing extraordinary. The breads, soft and the perfect matchmaker for the gravy. And what better to end the luncheon but with delicious kesar kulfi falooda? 

No holes burnt in the pocket but worth every penny!

Well!! This place has renovated big time. A year back this used be a small restaurant, but now it's as good as any big restaurants in the area, foods have been always good (not during pujas). This time we ordered chicken haryali kebabs, roti and chicken reshmi butter masala. All were great :) the ambiance was decent. Though few plates and spoons need to be changed. Overall a pocket friendly restaurant near Kalighat metro!!

One of the worst experience for the 2nd time.
Ordered tandori roti and egg tarka for dinner and found a small pebble while eating. Thankfully it didnt damage my teeth. The staff simply said he will replace it. This the 2nd time and this not the solution you expect.

The first bad experience was couple of months back when a coackroach flew down to our table near the kitchen.  The staff complained to the person in the reception. Initially he was smiling and when he saw us approaching changed his expression to a serious one. 

The hygeince and cleaniness standards out here are questionable.

My expectations came down after checking in here. We chose to sit in the first floor which was air conditioned. I ordered for kadhai chicken,kulfi and tandoori Roti.Kadhai chicken was improperly cooked. The meat pieces were too hard to be eaten.Same goes for tandoori Roti. Horrible!! Kulfi was okayish in taste. My food got wasted. Except for the food I ordered ,ambience is good and so is the price.

Staffs are very helpful . They have A.c & non a.c both arrangements.  We went to non a.c section to avoid extra charges . So we ordered total 7 plates of chicken biriyani ( Rs 150/- each ) & 4 coke (Rs 20/- each ) 200ml bottles ( small) . Our total bill was around Rs 1110/- .

Mutton masala was excellent in taste and the rotis were freshly prepared. After that we carried on ordering kesar lassi, milk mango and milk strawberry, among of them lassi was for mine and it was way good. Ambience was like a local dining place and quiet well suited coz it's a dhaba afterall. Price was typical dhabaish, no added tax in non ac section. :P Service was very good. Wanna go there again :)

Bachan's Dhaba is a very well known food joint in Kalighat area. Visited this place quite a few times earlier. Recently this place has been renovated and the interior and sitting arrangements are better than my earlier visits. They have non AC and AC sections both. We opted for the Non AC section as it's don't charge any extra tax. Foods are tasty as well as pocket friendly. Service is good. My only suggestion is that they must take care about the hygiene a little bit more. Wanna try their AC section once. Hope they would improve more in the future.

Finally revealing about food, the food tastes really good and is of good quality. But quantity is less and they don't have much stock of menus in the kitchen. Don't go for Chinese dishes, opt for North Indian. It is an affordable restaurant and is cheaper when compared to other restaurants.
We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Butter Tandoori Roti and Chicken Bharta. It tasted really good and fresh.

Date: 23/06/2017.
Location: Near kalighat metro station.
Item: 1 plate chicken biriyani.
Price: ₹150/-
Ambience: This place is divided into two parts. The upper floor is air conditioned and the ground floor is normal. Decoration was less but nice.
Staff and service: They served the food really quick. But the staff need to be increased to take proper care of the customers.
Description: The biriyani contained 1 big piece of chicken and 1 boiled potato. The portions were sufficient to fill 1 person. The rice has the rich aroma of biriyani. Chicken and biriyani both were well cooked.

Being really hungry after my tution classes I popped in here yesterday along with my friends for a quick snack.We had ordered chicken rolls and kesar pista kulfi.Though I had wanted to try their Sitaphal and Chikoo Kulfi which was not available unfortunately.We sat in the Non-Ac region which was a little untidy with a lot of papers lying around.Though the resturant was nice and big the untidiness was really a turn off.Moreover I had expected the chicken pieces in the roll to be juicy but it was so dry.They don't put in sauce or lemon in the rolls.On the other hand I did enjoy the kesar pista kulfi.It was delicious.

This place is huge. The non AC part of the restaurant in at the ground floor and they have the AC at the first floor. 
We ordered chicken tandoori as our starters. It was really good and i m talking about both the quantity and the taste. *many restaurants take out most of the boneless part from the the tandoori pieces to use in other cuisines but they didnt do that. 
We ordered paneer butter masala that was average.
Our next try was chicken bharta and roti. Though my friends loved it i didnt liked it that much to be honest. I have eaten better chicken bhartas. But still it was good most of the people will like it very much. 
The chilly chicken and the chowmin we ordered next was also nice. I loved the chowmin and the chilly chicken was also satisfactory *not that excellent as in the chinese restaurants.
We ordered biryani too. It was excellent but i have to mention this do not have mutton biryani here try the chicken biryani. Actually the meat quality of the mutton was bad of cheap quality. But chicken tasts good everywhere so try that. But still the biryani is excellent here. 
The service was awesome. Though the place was crowded they brought our dishes very fast. My friend spilled water on the table which was taken care well by the boys working there.  
Overall an excellent place to visit if you are roaming around rashbehari or the lake mall. Cheers

This place is easily located at Rash Behari Crossing. The food of this place is good and with my recent encounters I found they have reduced the oil content in their food. As this place is really close to my house I have ordered several times and I have never found it to be something not eatable.

Visited this place twice and the experience has never been disappointing !
We generally opt for the house specials avoiding the chinese cuisine here.
We ordered for :
○ Chicken biryani : a treat to your tastebuds. 9.5/10. Comes with a soft piece of meat and a potato. Priced anywhere around 145 rupees.
○Tandoori roti :usual at 8 rupees.
○butter nan : soft nan with lots of butter priced at 30 rupees.
○ Chicken kadai : awesome preparation of chicken with masala and egg. Tastes very good. Prices at 180 rupees approx.
○ chicken bharta : flavourful dish consisting of shredded pieces of chicken .

A very cheap outlet serving amazing mughlai foods and bill was anywhere around 600 rupees. It also has an AC sitting arrangement on the floor above. The decor is soothing with a large window outlooking the busy street. Service is satisfactory.
Definitely would like to visit again and again.

Mixed fried rice:  taste so so but the rice was not cooked so it was so hard
Chiken tikka masala :  nothing special on it
Butter nun :good
Tarka:  spicy tasty ..but not so special
So to me it is not so special dhaba...

First time I was very hungry so couldn't take the picture properly. 😛 Had to eat first. Ordered tandoori roti, reshmi chicken butter masala and mutton kosha. Delicious dishes but the mutton was chewi.
The second time I ordered a mixture of North Indian and Chinese. Had tandoori chicken, mixed rice, chicken kadhai. Chicken kadhai was delicious which definately goes with tandoori roti. Yummilicious was my experience this time. Will visit again.

Located close to Kalighat Metro station, Bachan' s dhaba is one of the best that you will find in that locality. Spread on two floors with AC and Non AC section,  This Dhaba attracts decent crowds. Serves Primarily Indian food but do have some popular Chinese dishes too. Ambiance is minimal with white and Brown combination. 

We visited on a Thursday afternoon and the restaurant was packed. It was expected as being the lunch time. We ordered for Chicken tikka butter masala along with assorted Indian breads. Chicken dish was decent but somehow I found it a bit spicy. 

An average meal for two will  not cost more than 500. Guess they make descent Biryanis too. Observed many people ordering it.

Located just beside Kalighat metro station, this ancient restaurant(being established in the pre-independence era) is one of my favourites. It has two sections- the ground floor non-AC section, which is unbearably hot being located just beside the kitchen, and the 1st floor AC section, which I prefer. The variety of food is good and the quality great, especially the Hari mirch ki Roti and Mutton Saag fry. The lassi is refreshing. The sitting arrangement is comfortable and the service is quite good. Surprisingly, the prices are quite cheap compared to quality, quantity and service. A big thumbs up to Bachhans' dhaba.

The waiter guy told us that there's no chienese available, no kadhai chicken item available, no kebab, no starter & not even the kulfi.. then hell u guys were doing there??? They gave us lame excuses as the cook was sick & all those stuffs.. & they cant provide the kulfi shit as it'll melt if its opened before 2.30.. oh really!!! Give me a break..
Then we had to order mutton biriyani as there was not a single ny other item available & that just tastes like the Rs. 70 biriyani outside the tollygunge metro.. Wow!! Such a good service provider u guys are..👏👏👏👏👏👏

It is one of the few places in Kolkata where one can get decent food at a reasonable price. Placed at the Rashbehari Avenue, this place offers Chinese and Indian cuisines at a pocket friendly price. Though the ambience is average but the wait time for food is quite minimal, suprisingly. If you're looking for a budget restaurant to have a hearty meal then this one is just for you.

Bacchan's Dhaba is a popular and busy place during peak dining hours. The ground floor has a non ac seating while the first floor incorporates ac dining. The food tastes great, however, non availability of dishes put up in the menu proved to be a disappointment.
Anyways, we settled for Chicken Tikka to start with, followed by Jeera Rice and Kadhai Chicken. The Chicken Tikka was succulent and rightly spiced. And Kadhai Chicken complemented the Jeera Rice well. Service is efficient and prompt. Light on the pocket. 
Overall good experience. Recommended for a quick lunch or dinner on the go.

This is one of the oldest dhaba the heart of this city. 
Ambience: Ordinary sitting arrangement. You will also find an AC hall inside. Soothing decorations. 
Food : This place maintains the quality of the food to the core
Food is always Delicious here. 
We ordered:
•Chicken tikka kabab- Delicious.
•Mixed fried rice- Finger licking good. 
•Chicken in reshmi butter masala- Too good. it was superb. 
This is a pocket friendly resturent. You can always come here and try anything you want. and that will be absolutely awesome.

Well, the tandoori roti was very tasty and soft. 1 full plate of chicken Tikka butter masala was more than enough for 2 of us. Bachan's Dhaba is just beside gate no.10 of Kalighat metro station. The sitting arrangements on the ground floor is non-ac and no tax is being charged whereas that on the first floor is air conditioned and inclusive of tax.

This is one place my grandparents swear by. Every time I'm in Kolkata, Bachan ka dal tarka and egg tarka are supposed to be the delights of my trip.

The place  has earned its reputation by its sheer taste. Their consistency in providing tasty food is unmatchable in that area.

Nowadays it gets quite crowded and the place is understaffed and disorganised.  The Swiggy people keep cluttering the place and we had to wait for an hour for our take away. 
I hope they solve this issue asap for its loyalists

Horrible Ambience.Noisy.Dirty.Unhygenic.Chicken bharta was full of water and tasteless,No boiled egg topping.Matar Keema was black in colour and stale.Could have been 7 days old.Tandoori butter roti was like papad and hard as hell.Mutton Biryani was pathetic with the aroma of Rose water spreading all over the room,although it was the only one ordered at that moment.Only food eatable was the Egg Tarka,chicken tandoori and Reshmi kebab.BAD EXPERIENCE.WOULD NOT RECOMEND IT TO ANY ONE WHO IS A FOODIE.PLS AVOID THIS PLACE.

I went here along with a friend last Sunday. The place was fully congested. The waiter asked us to share the table with another family rather insisting us to share the table. Luckily we got a table after waiting for 20 mins, but somehow the waiter was successful in imbibing his concept of sharing the table in some other family's head so this family joined us..and 6 people were sharing a 4 seated table.. Now comes the food. I ordered Chicken Tandoori Half but the waiter said it will take a lot of time so I asked which starter will be available shortly..He said I DON'T KNOW. I mean if u don't know then who is supposed to know? I ordered Chicken Biriyani Special. He was coming with the plate n suddenly I saw him outside the door (since it is a glass door), he was checking in the plate of biriyani by putting his fingers whether it has 2 chicken pieces or not! Since it was ordered a special plate of chicken biriyani. So basically hygienic level is zero. Very disappointed for my visit to Bachan's Dhaba. Moreover while paying by card, he asked me to sit in my place..the n he came..N we had the transaction..then he asked me in a very rude way about the tips. Though in front of me I have seen him NOT asking every people for tips. I mean can anybody explain me in what way he is choosing the people for giving him tips? Sick is what he is. Overall very bad experience.

We had Rumali Roti which were being served 1 at a time, with keema muttur and mixed vegetable. I loved the Keema Muttur, however the mixed vegatable was average.

The service was not bad. However the cutlery could improve.

Well,you might take a visit to figure out.
Located right beside the gate of Kalighat Metro and is very easy to find.
We ordered zeera rice which was full of stones and had a typical smell which was NOT of roasted cumin.
Coming to the side dish,chicken reshmi butter masala - the chicken was undercooked,did not taste anything like a reshmi kebab.But the gravy was prepared well with just the right amount of butter.
The dishes were quite cheap - both moneywise and tastewise.

This a roadside dhaba located in Rashbehari Avenue, kalighat. It's very near to my grandmother's house. Visited many times to have some kebabs. Kebabs are the best they have to offer in my opinion.

The restaurant is a very popular amongst the Calcuttans especially the young ones. It is a very old joint and maintains the quality of the food to the core. They have very ordinary sitting arrangement and have a small and simple AC hall as well. You may not feel very attracted initially but once you have the food, you will go back to them for sure. The specialty of this restaurant is Egg Tadka which is a must have item there with Rumali Roti. You can try out their Chicken Kasha which has a thick gravy made of onion, garlic and other spices. The taste remains in your mouth for long. The food is not at all expensive there.

The kulfi was also good to taste. But that's how they normally taste.. 
Service was a bit slow.

Went around 9:30 pm. Waiter came after 10 mins with the menu card. Ordered mutton fry, reshmi kebab, garlic naan, lachha parantha and salad. Waited for 45 minutes and the only thing arrived was a plate of salad. They said it will take another 10 mins for the food. Worst service. Staffs are ill mannered. 

So went for the second time after a friend's suggestion to try other items. Tried Reshmi Kebab-. It could have been more softer. But it was go@od. Ended up with Mango shake. No changes in d behavior of the staffs.

The place was nice. Ambience was ok ok type. But the way the treated their customers that need to be changed. They were not welcoming at all. When entered there was no one to arrange us a place to sit. We went to the 1st floor and the scenario was same. We stood there for 5 to 10 mnts lyk a fool then we were told to wait outside as they were full. After a while we got a place to sit. We were six people together. Some of us ordered biriyani which was not plenty enough for one person and the taste was not ok too. But they charge 180 for each plate. Me and my friend ordered tandoori roti masala kulcha and tikka butter masala. Dish was okay. But I had the same prep @ Shimla biriyani and that tasted way more better than this one. The price is too high according to the quality of the food. Not that much satisfied.

Had a take away experience at tonight's dinner. It's my dad's official party and they took the order from here. umm.. the mandate dish was mutton biryani definitely!😂 it was thr special packet of it and as it was so huuuuugeee in quantity we had to share. 😅 I found the biryani a tiny, little bit dry. But, but really good in taste. Also not oily, or made of cheap things which we have to face sometimes while trying biryani. I didn't find it unhygienic too! Very light,and you'll not feel overwhelmed after eating for sure. The mutton pieces were so well boiled, that if we wanted then we could chew the bones too!!😂✌ I mean, the bones were very soft what our teeth felt! And, mutton pieces should be like this. I heard about this place before only on Zomato but heard a lot from my dad today. It's a very special multi joint what I came to know! with a great "money-saving" price! ohh!! so a new place is added to my wishlist. Eagerly waiting to be there and to dine. Recommended.

A budget friendly/pocket friendly place with a decent ambience and great North Indian food. 
To begin with the ambience is moderate and decent, the staffs are courteous and cordial in nature.
Their chicken reshmi kebab, chicken butter masala, butter nun, tandoori roti are pure delicacies and is a good treat to your taste buds. The kebabs are just perfect, the roti and nun are great in taste as well as in  their texture. However their biriyani is a turndown and I would definitely recommend not to order their biriyani, it's dry and bland in taste. However the prices of the foods are quite reasonable.
This place is a few minute's walk from the rashbihai more.

Bachan's Dhaba has been trying to up it's game and redecorate the place to give it a more luxurious feel for a while. However, the usp of this place remains the Dhaba style, rustic North Indian food. They make really good tandoori items. The chicken reshmi butter masala is a favourite. They have kulchas sometimes which are soft and delicious. The ambiance isn't good and the kitchen is very dirty. But then, that is what most Dhabas are like, right?

We had ordered chicken tikka masala and butter nun .. The food taste good .. The tikka masala was delicious with balance spices and bit spicy which i liked it ..
Somehow, the only drawback is the price are light higger compared to other dhabas
Other than that it is good :)

A Dhaba is synonymous with North Indian food with robust flavours and in this count Bachan's Dhaba doesn't disappoint. It is renowned for its North Indian cuisine and I love their tarka with roti.I also liked their paneer tikka which was cooked perfectly in a tandoor and well coated with masala. Unlike other places where paneer tikka is usually ordinary here it was true blue Punjabi style one....Quite spicy and soft big chunks. Prices are very reasonable, once again in keeping with being a Dhaba.

Since i reside near rashbehari so bachans dhaba has been the constant restaurant for take away since childhood. Recently they renovated the whole restaurant and made the first floor which is very decent and the ambience is good for a proper family dinner unlike before.They have separate stall for rolls and kebabs take away.
Their chinese food was really delicious till the renovation started... suddenly the amounts have gone pretty much down, every food has become too much oily... in chilli chiken or chicken manchurian or any such Chinese main dish you will find very small pieces of chicken unlike before... noodles and fried rice dishes are still good and tasty though.
The north indian dishes are more or less the same... and their kebabs and biriyani really tastes great... by the way they make great tarkas (famous in the zone)..
My favourite dishes are biriyani, chicken bharta, reshmi butter masala, naan or tandoori roti, chicken tandoori and all types of kebab. Their kulfi is a must try.

They have finished with the renovation almost 2 months ago.
Ground floor is for general sitting whereas the 1st floor is air conditioned - that's the good news.
And as usual, food quality and quantity is good.
Now the worst part: They don't accept cashless payments nowadays (they had the facility before renovation). With pride they have written "We do not accept cart payments". In present scenario, when every restaurant  provides cashless payment facility, they are the one who has stopped it!

If you are planning to visit this place with your (BIG) family, make sure to keep hard cash in your pocket! DISGUSTING and DISAPOINTING

Ordered from this place the previous day. Let me get straight on to food. 

- Laccha Paratha - Very good. (One can literally feel the eggs and the how well the dough was made) Note, some restaurants in Kolkata do not really put egg in the batter during the making process.

- Chicken Reshmi Tikka Masala - 8 decently large boneless piece straight from the tandoor .Chicken was fresh, and not frozen. Mild gravy ; Excellent quality.

- Tandoori Chicken - I have no words, you must try!

Summing, they do not compromise in quality or quantity. The food is very fresh and made with a lot of care. A must try!

Bachan's Dhaba is now one of those dhabas which just goes by the name of dhaba and unlike any normal dhaba, the food prices are tending towards the higher side. Keeping the price aside, the place has a good ambience and the food tastes lovely. We were a bit unlucky to have missed out the Sarso Ka Saag. The Tandoori Rotis and Mutton Kasha did serve upto it's expectations. Koolfi is a must for any visitor.

Recently been to this dhaba after hearing a lot of good things from friends. Ambience is typical dhaba. That means no AC, and visiting this place in summer might be a bit problem for some. But what exactly is available is proper tasty food and within budget. Tandoori items are properly cooked and mouthwatering. Although Chinese items are available we did not tried them. Overall its a good place to be when you are tight on budget.

●Bachan's Dhaba a very popular Dhaba in South Kolkata. Recently the place have been renovated beautifully. The Ambience is fine. Staff's were normal but little ignorant. 
Food specially : 
▪ Roomali Roti
▪ Plain tarka
▪ Double egg tarka
▪ Chicken haryali kebab
▪ Reshmi butter masala
Some of the dishes i have tried. It worked wonderfully...
I loved the food my taste buds were enjoying more than me! 
● Good place 
●Good food 
●Good dhaba
You must try it :) am sure it will not disappoint you.

Great location. Located on the main road. 
Value for money is great. 
We took 2 plates of chicken biryani and 1 mutton tikia and 1 chicken Bharta. 
The biryani was really tasty and the mutton tikia was full of flavours. 
Bharta wasn't upto the mark thou. 
Overall experience was good.

My first visit to the Rashbehari Gurdwara... On Guru Nanak's birthday.. We were food hunting after being hungry since morning... We ended up here trying to look for food which could suit us somewhere in the middle of breakfast and lunch... Ordered a plate of butter paneer masala... Tandoori roti and green salad... 
Food: loved it!
Ambience: I was at the first floor and I quite liked the place.
Prices: very reasonable.
Thumbs down: the staff were ignorant as we had to ask for water and paper napkins too... Behaviour wasn't bad though.
Since I went there for a quick meal... I would keep the rest of the rating for the next time I go there for a proper meal and which would Ofcourse be non-veg! :p

Being a dhaba, it is always special for North indian cuisine with rich flavours. Offcourse so. Being very easy to locate it has gained lot of popularity. The nonveg starters are really tasty. The main course is okayish and at a very reasonable price.

A Dhaba is mainly specialised for its authentic North Indian cuisine. And it goes for this old place too. Though the ambiance is quite chaotic but the food quality is good and also pocket friendly.

I have been here several times. Peak point is it's location!
I somehow have mixed experience with this dhaba - sometimes it was an excellent experience and next was an average! 
Ambience? Keeping in mind it's a dhaba it's having an average ambience-  Chaotic!! 
Foods are really testy and serve you with great quantity. 
You actually won't be able to eat whole items!
Thanks

This restaurant has a great location. Right on the desapriya crossing. Thumbs up to that. 
Really it had been renovated n still expanding.
The ambience at the ground floor is like a chaotic Dhaba which I don't prefer. No Ac, too crowded. 

The 1st floor is newly built and clean and styled well. The lamps there are 3d and gorgeous.  

We ordered -

Chicken tandoori half plate-  it consisted of two pas,  one of it was leg pc. It was dry, spicy and delicious.  

Chicken Reshmi kebab - fish or was soft, night and succulent.  It was the best thing in a long time. Must try. It had 6 pcs in half plate. 

Double egg tarka - this was the most disappointing. It has no onion, garlic. Only salt and egg. Not recommended. 

All in all I was satisfied with the starters. Will reach visit for the starters only.

Visited during this year's Pujo on Panchami with friends and very naturally it was crowded.

Very disorganised way of letting people in. People after you will get in first. They write down names for who's sake, God knows! Then after making you wait for an hour, they give you a 3 seater for the 6 of us. On complaining, they make you wait for another 40 minutes till victory!

Coming to food, very disappointed with the Biryani. Was getting that strong smell of rose water which was in excess.
Not considering the quality of the paneer, the Palak Paneer was good. Matar Paneer was okay. Tandoori Rotis were fine.

Want to go back to try their kebabs and non-veg sides during non-Pujo days.

It is one of the oldest dhaba situated in rash behari avenue. Eat many times since childhood. Presently they have upgraded with AC rooms and others. Love the tarka with butter tandoori roti/ b.nan. chicken kabab is also very good. In the morning the aloo paratha is Awesome and one cannot stop with just one.

So this is one of the oldest dhaba that Kolkata have established in 1927...the interior has been modernised with time but the food has remain as tasty as ever. They also have AC sitting arrangement.I just had dinner there day before yesterday and ordered their specialties Chicken Tarka, Tandoori roti, Mixed Vegetable and at the end Malai Kulfi.
The mixed veg was spicy, vegetables crunchy and super tasty. Tarka is their specialty and when served with minced chicken, nothing can be better than that.
They serve malai kulfi with Semai and is equally good.

The ambiance of the restaurant was good. No comment on that. But about the staff!!  The staff was incredibly disrespectful, inattentive and discourteous. They were extremely ill-mannered and rude. And I would never go back there. They were completely heedles about our needs. 
Firstly we were not greeted. Secondly we were given no menu cards. Only when the waiter had  come to take the orders then did he know that there were no menu cards. Thirdly, there was no tissues in our tables. Fourthly, we were not served with waters . We had to ask for it. All of this shows how much inconsiderate the staff is. After all of this the quality of food hardly matters ! Still got to review the food. The food was fairly average. Considering the prices it wasn't that good. We had ordered fried rice,  chilly chicken and biriyani. The fried rice could have been better and chilly chicken was average. But yes..the biriyani was fairly good. The meat was soft. Nut overall I would like to give the food a 2 out of 5.
Ultimately I absolutely find no reason to go back there. Considering the behaviour of the staff it's an absolute no. I would rather die of hunger than go back there. A terrible experience.

Hey finally find this place out in Zomato to review.. Have been visiting this place from college times pretty regularly.  My college was near Golpark and may be twice within a week would come here for takeaway and sometimes for lunch as well.  
Damn cheap food is good and the staff is quick to serve. 
The place is always bustling with people sometimes you have to wait outside to get in. 
Our favorite was there range of tadkas with roomali or tandoori roti

So, the disclaimer is that we have ordered so much food from this outlet via Swiggy but have never visited this restaurant personally and so it would be unjustifiable to give it a 5 on 5..
Location - Easy to locate, but parking would be an issue. 4 on 5.
Ambience - It is definitely not some place where you can expect great crowds, so the foodies would like to tend to home deliveries. 3 on 5.
Food Quality and Presentation - You can't expect much presentation at this shack-cum-restaurant, but the quality is heaven. Right from the Dal Fry to the Rotis and Naans to the Chicken to the Mutton dishes - you can't actually find a single misfit in the entire plethora of menus. 5 on 5.
Value for Money - Given the Dhabas in Kolkata and their exorbitant rates, this place is heaven. You will find at least a difference of 30% in the price offered without any compromisation in quality and that's the best thing i loved about this place. 5 on 5 again.
Service - Now, as reiterated, i haven't been here personally, but from the delivery timelines, i do find that they are very swift and prompt in service and so the turnaround time is quite less as compared to other joints. A 3 on 5.

Not all places in Kolkata are sit and dine styles, or if, they are, it may so be that you might not like the crowds or the ambience, but the food can be as good and mouth watering, and you would come back again and again, and that's what this joint promises.

If you want nice atmosphere, or hospitality then surely this not the place you are looking for. But if you want to have some tasty cuisines and a different experience then definitely it's a place worthy of a visit. Ordered multiple cuisines, and more or less all of them were nice in taste. As I said earlier hospitality and the ambience is the biggest problem with that place. All my ratings for this place, is just for the taste of the food.

They have recently opened an AC outlet, just beside the old outlet and we visited that. Good north Indian food, nothing changed with that, i guess the kitchen remained the same but I think they can really work a bit more on the food. Good place for a regular north indian meal, can surely try out, with average prices.

An old pocket friendly restaurant located on the heart of Rash Behari crossing on the right while going towards Gurudwara.Their mouth watering kebabs are just mind blowing specially the chicken haryali kebab. I would also recommend to try out their mutton lever kofta curry which tastes brilliant with laccha paratha. Service is instant.

This restaurant is situated just next to Kalighat metro. Bachan's Dhaba has been there for a long time. The quality of the food according to my taste can be better but the quantity is good. Talking about the ambience of the dhaba, it's just beside the main road but no problem with that. The main issue is with the smokes and gases coming outside the kitchen where the guests are seated. The waiters are polite and helpful. Though I found that the place where the food packets are kept are very unclean and unhygienic where a cockroach was sitting next to it.

It has a great ambience and staff members are too friendly. It have a great variety of dishes to choose.The North Indian dishes are finger licking, I would suggest you to order one from those dishes.Other thn the North Indian dishes the continental is not so good but it's value for money.You can definitely give a try to Bachan's Dhaba....From my side it's a thumbs up to Bachan's Dhaba

I recently went here for lunch. It's located very near to the Kalighat Metro Station. We reached around 1.45pm and was told that none of the kebabs were available, however people who arrived towards the end of our meal did have the kebab option. The prices in the air-conditioned first floor is slightly more than those in ground floor and all prices are inclusive of tax. The staff were very courteous however they kept us waiting for long and found it hard to follow simple instructions.Now coming to the food, we had ordered tandoori rotis, butter naan, dal makhani, chicken bharta and kadhai chicken. Every single item was very delicious. The kadhai chicken was tasty, but I felt it was just like a less spicy version of home-made chicken kosha and even though it's supposed to have 4 pieces, we were given just 3. All the other items were amazing and that too at dirt cheap prices. Our total bill for 3 people was less than 600. Hence if you're in the neighborhood, please try this place. You will not be disappointed with the food. As for the staff's unorganized behavior, I don't mind it when the food's that good!

Bachan's dhaba is a pocket friendly restaurant serving  North Indian food. It serves you nice, juicy kababs and tandooris. Chicken hariali kabab is worth a mention. The indian breads served here are also very soft and fluffy. Rest of the food are average. They have recently renovated the place with a nice decor. The ambience is just fine.

Location : At rashbehari more ,  The kalighat metro stoppage

Ambiance : Barely any especially if you're seated at the ground floor . Light colored tiled  walls adorn the place . Good enough .

Food : A typical dhaba affair  although Chinese cuisine  is mentioned in the menu as well .  Ordered the Full Chicken Tandoori kebabs as an appetizer .  Unlike many places it wasn't dry at all was quite juicy .  Since the Durga Puja was underway the menu was quite restricted in the number of items . We followed that up with Reshmi butter masala with 4 Plain nan  and Tikka Butter Masala . The reshmi preparation was off white  with oodles of oil coming out of the dish. But it was damn tasty soft , boneless  balls of chicken  . The Nan was of the appropriate size . But the Tikka masala , reddish in colour was the tastiest of them all ! Both the masalas were a bit on the spicy side .

Cost for 2 : 500/- plus

Final conclusion : Good enough . Not a place to redefine your taste palate but a cheap place where you'll find good food with no complaints .

The staff was horrible and the food quite sparse! We minimized our order to such an extent where we could not get even a proper dessert or a main course! The mutton was properly cooked but the chicken was too sweet! And we were surprised at the end when the waiters asked us for tips! Not recommended !

I had seen this place a multiple times while passing through rashbehari and really wanted to try it out. Visited with a couple of friends. We sat in the non AC section so I cannot comment on the decor of the AC section which is on the 1st floor. The non AC section is very plain and simple but very spacious. In this section you must be prepared to share your table. We ordered hariyali kebab,chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken tikka masala and chicken kadai.
The biriyani was really good and ample in quantity. The chicken and the mutton pieces were soft and well cooked. I did not like the hariyali kebab that much . It was kind of dry for me. Both the side dishes were kind of average as I could not differentiate the separate taste of both.
The place is really pocket friendly and perfect for a quick bite. The service is slow and you need to call for the waiters multiple times.

Very conviniently located just opposite to kalighat metro and near lake mall this is a fabulous place to meet ur hunger. They provide indian mughlai and chinese dishes. I have been here quite a number of times but during puja days there is a big queue infront and they quite efficiently provide service quickly. I had a parcel done of mixd fried rice and chilli chkn. The service was fast but the price was too high i thought. May be they have increases the rates for puja.

Ok, this place is something like of a memory for both of us, (my wife and I). It's situated at Stone throwing distance from her home, so it's been like her every Saturday night restaurant for her and her family. 
Though, I've eaten a lot less from here, this restaurant located at one of the busiest junction of Kolkata, I've traversed by this restaurant like everyday at one point of time.
After our starters from the Sharmas, we got in here, for our main course.
Most of the times, I've had a takeaway from here, or late night puja hopping dinner, where you pack the biryani boxes and eat in the car. However, it was my 1st time that I dined in this place.

Bachans dhaba,  sport a newly renovated look. The AC portion is still under construction, we got ourselves seated in the ground floor and near the live kitchen of sorts!
During 9 Pm on a Saturday, being the bishwakarma pujo day , it was filled to the brink. We shared the table with another couple. 
Ordered tandoori rotis, butter chicken tikka masala and a plate of green salad. The tandoori rotis were served just from the oven, it was hot. 
The tikka masala, with smoke emanating from it, had eight pieces of soft, jumbo sized chicken swimming in a reddish gravy full of cholesterol and heart choking elements. The roti and the tikka masala went like long lost lovers in our mouth. It was heaven. 
We ordered another plate of butter chicken reshmi masala for home. It was yummy too.
In general, the chicken tandoori and kebab items they serve is nice and yummy. I had their biryani, a lot of times, it has nice quantity of rice and decent size of boti, be it chicken or mutton . However, it isn't my favourite. I've eaten far better biryani in other places.
I don't like their Chinese, it's too desi. Personally I think , dhabas shouldn't serve Chinese.

Went there today as i was very hungry and found it with a completely look. Lovely makeover. The interiors are very nice and clean. I loved the wall paintings and lights. About the food we ordered tandoori roti and chicken reshmi masala. The roti was good. Chicken was very tender and melted in the mouth. Then we took kulfi which tasted similarly good. Add on points for no extra tax on the bill. Strongly recommended.

We had no other option because it was already late. So we stopped by to pack food from here. We ordered biryani with a side munching chilli chicken. Biryani was average for 140 bucks minus the egg. Overall pretty average! I guess, we should have opted for the tandoori stuff. Next time :)

Delicious foods.
The restaurant is present in Rash Bihari, Kolkata. Long time back I went to this place and had Biryani and it was really good. After that few days ago I tasted Chicken Kadhai and Chicken Bharta and it was really tasty. The quality is really very good and the quantity is also proper.
Later I visited again in this shop and ate Masala Kulcha along with Chicken Butter Masala and Palak Paneer the quality was very good even the quantity. The food was very much delicious and many other shops. 
It is one of the famous restaurant in Kolkata.
Keep serving good food.

The quintessential dhaba amidst the hustle bustle of the Rashbehari stop is much talked about. I've been quite regular to this place, since my colg days. Well, they have 2sections...one being the non-AC another being AC, the non-ac one entirely looks dhaba with joint tables and crowded almost all the time.
Some of my favourite dishes here are Biryani...such luscious biryani in lower rates, then chicken bharta with butter naan...the most delicious bharta I've tasted till now. I like kulfi-faluda of this dhaba as well...
Pocket pinch is very less, prices also varies with non ac, and ac section. Waiters are torpid..it takes too much time to place a order when crowded.
Otherwise it's a nice place to have food.

Pocket friendly but not awe-inspiring. Okay for filling your stomach if you're in a hurry. Not recommending for fine dining experiences. Average on the cleanliness.

Bachan's has been an absolute favourite of mine since my childhood.They have a lot of different kebabs on their menu.And every one of them tastes great.They have these huge chunks of chicken which can lighten up anybody's mood.Their fish kebabs is my dad's favourite.I love their mutton biryani.The side dishes are great too but the kebabs are the ones that will make you come back again and again.

It's one of my favourite place for lip smacking kebabs and rolls.


Located in rashbehari more,kalighat ( near the metro station) 

I visited this place several times and thought of writing a review.


So after the 2nd year exams were over me and few of my friends again visited and calmed our hungry souls. Hahahah ! 


We ordered..

Reshmi kebab 

Boti kebab 

Butter Nun 

Chicken kadai 

Koolfi 


As I mentioned earlier the kababs were lip smacking , tender and jucilicious.

The chicken kadai was awesome and full of species ( just the way I like ) ,a must try.


And for the dessert we ordered their koolfi.


Well the place is ok ok. 

And I never tried there Chinese's food.


Do visit and do try out there dishes. 🙂

I have been to this place for the last 20 years . Recently the outlet has been face lifted to give a modern look but the quality of the food remains the same. I will particularly mention the awesome taste of Double Egg Tadka ( however all  the tadka items are the best one here) and the kebabs ( they don't prepare the Kebabs , but get if from the sister concern just next door). The other items like chicken bharta , chicken reshmi butter masala , sarson ka saag are worth mentioning. This place also serves chines foods but I will prefer not to have the Chinese food in this place , which is specialised in the North Indian dishes. 

You will get very good Lassi here as well the Koolfi throughout the year. 

With the new look, the family and the general areas are well maintained and air conditioned.

This place is a must visit to taste authentic Punjabi food. The kulfi they make is out of the world, one has to try it to understand the taste.
Their tadka chicken/ egg whatever one opts for surely can make everyone happy both with the quality and quantity. Mutton liver fry for those with low cholesterol who can risk to get off the regular mundane diet is a must. Chicken dishes are equally good. I never had biriyani here, I always prefer to take tandoori rotis. Service is also good. The place is hygienic as well and the best part is the pricing which I think is commendable.

A late night eat out after a family function at this dhaba near kalighat was quite an experience, as it was their closing hour. 
We had ordered many things as there were 15 of us. They have chinese and indian both on their menu, obviously as its a dhaba north indian was the best out here. When we reached their biryani was over, so we had to opt for paranthas and naans. We also got mutton korma, mutton kasha, chicken tikka butter masala and kulfi as dessert. The mutton was soft and tender, nonetheless very tasty, so was the chicken. Butter naan was also perfect and soft. 
The kulfi was a total disappointment at the end of the meal, it seemed like they had to sell out few last defective pieces so they got their job done selling it to us. And they denied to serve water even, for the second round.
Ambiance is nothing great just a better form of dhaba, with few frames and interesting wallpaper at one corner of the eatery. If you are in a hurry and want cheap dhaba style food this can be a good option in kalighat.

this time when i came back to the city, they were having some repair works done, so we just packed it up and came home. well the food quality seemed to have gone down a tad bit, but that might be the result of the construction work and all.  but then again, for me its an old bond, but for new or first timers this decline in quality might matter

Located near Rashbehari crossing, easy to spot. One of my friends told me about this place. It's apparently famous for biriyani. Now after hearing that how could I not try. :P
So ordered Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. Well, I'll say I've had better. It was alright. Not too good not too bad. The chicken chaap was decent enough. Prices reasonable. Don't expect much of an ambience. Service was ok.

It used to be a very nice place but lately their quality has deteriorated. Its a very old restaurant located at the junction of the Rashbehari crossing. Among the food you can try their chicken butter masala, chicken bharta   and egg tarka and the kulfi ( which is my personal favourite).  You can also try their chinese dishes which is pretty decent. The ambience is pleasing only if you are sitting in the AC section. The prices are affordable. PS: Dont try their Biryani.

This is perhaps the most iconic dhaba in and around Rashbehari Avenue and I know many friends of mine who prefer this dhaba over Jai Hind, Azad Hind or Sharma Dhaba. I really do not wish to compare but Bachan's Dhaba is also great. I like the food that they make and really do not expect a great deal out of ambience and service. This place is all about finger licking food. Be it biryanis, tandooris, kebabs, chinese dishes or simple roti-tadka-chicken, everything is just awesome.

4. Mutton Do Pyaza

Fond part of culinary folk-lore for so many Calcuttans, but absolutely new for me - my sole visit to Bachan's left me with an average experience. Clean for a Dhaba with immense footfall on a saturday evening, I was served promptly my orders - a better- average egg tarka and palak paneer, with pretty decent rumali, kulcha and naan. Everything was pretty cheap for the quantity they serve.

Come winter and I may find myself ordering the more seasonal palak paneer and the tandoori chicken. Or, I may not. Because it's one of those just-about-okay food experiences that do not immediately win over one's mind. 

In verdict : Either visit or don't, because there's no loss if you don't eat here and there's no gain if you do as well !

We ordered for veg noodles, chicken butter masala and tandoori roti.
The food served was cold.
I had to literally gulp down the food because I was damn hungry.

This a great place for students like me, located right next to Kalighat Metro, it is bustling with people & tasty food. The Tandoori Chicken is great & you get good sizeable pieces of chicken polished with butter. The biryani and Chicken Kadhai is what I had & I would say both were a good choice. The food is served fresh & also the pricing doesn’t hurt the pocket so it is a win-win!

Really was not havinh high hopes but was pleasantly serprised by the food quality. The rotis were soft and the highlight was the reshmi butter chicken.the chicken pieces were reallysoft and the gravy a rich mix of cashew paste and cococut milk was a welcome change. Loved it.

Kebabs are succulent. chicken tikka butter masala, dal makhani are also  class. My fav :)

O how I used to survive on Bacchan's role when I took tuitions in that area.
I love, absolutely LOVE their rolls. The egg chicken roll is a winner. Juicy flavourful pieces of meat rolled with a laccha paratha into delicious awesomeness.
Their kebabs ar good too. I haven't other dishes over there though. This place remains crowded more or less all the time.

The egg tarka is also great. This place went through renovation and added an AC section in the last decade. 
It has existed for a very long time, Its one of the few places where they serve these authentic punjabi stuff. The chinese and other additions to their menu are not worth trying. Price is also economical. Superb taste maintained over the years.

I had taken as per reviewer's choice and had ordered Chicken hariyali kabab, Tandoori Roti, Chicken Bharta, Egg chicken tadka and Mutton kosha... all the dishes were excellent especially the bharta. I thought that the tadka had some scope of improvement by making it more spicy.. Mutton was soft and tasted great.. Did a lot of bing eating due to my friends.. but guys the quantity is sufficient.
Low budget with good food n treat... this place is recommended.

Hi Guys, I was actually looking around,strictly speaking searching around  zomato regarding what is the "THE BEST TASTED DISH" of any given restaurant .This search made me to comment the only one dish on a restaurant with a special notation as "Mind Blowing ".So from here I would like to mention only the mind blowing dish of a particular restaurant .

Coming to Bachaans Dhaba to me the Mind Blowing dish was Chicken Bharta. Let me explain you
1.It was superb dish to watch / not of of a great aroma-The texture is creamy.
2.The bharta was a spread of chicken shredded delectably cooked in a wonderful thick gravy.
3. On the top it is served with boiled egg which give the dish excellent gourmet experience.
4.The next thing is that it melts in you mouth .

Have it with garam tandoor roti /take one after another / finish it with chilled thumbs up . Have a great eating out.

One of the most pocket friendly place. Near Kalighat metro. Well known place for it's name as it is said to be one eatery Mr. Amitabh Bachchan used to visit during his struggling days. So the name. Big place around 50-60 seater. Recently renovated. But No AC yet. Food is good and cheap. We had chicken tandoori, mutton keema matar tarka, tandoori roti, salad, raita, kulfi and all this with in Rs 400. Service is good, despite rush. Around 5-6 famous delivery app service ppl were waiting there on a weekday at 10 p. m shows their popularity. Only thing I didn't like was the curd in both chatni with Tandoori Chicken and Raita was not smelling good. They should take care about this. Decor, food quality, service, price everything is perfect. Good place to have some good food in budget.

One thing I have to mention is this restaurant is the most pocket friendly restaurant of kolkata. There may be a lot, but I havent come across any other restaurants like this one.
The food is rich, typical punjabi styled, served fresh and delicious.
I have tasted many of the dishes from their menu as I have visited the place more than 100 times!
What I prefer is their mixed fried rice, garlic chicken, tandoori roti, nun, masala kulcha, tarka and chicken bharta.
My father always order their mutton kasha!
Another thing I have to mention is the restaurant has changed its overall look as well as the seating arrangements. After the make over, I felt the place really good for family gatherings!
Must visit!
I recommend!

Easily reachable it attracts a lot of people almost all the time. The interiors have got a massive makeover, as was informed to me by 1 of my friend. We were lucky enough to get a seat. I had ordered Roomali Roti, Paneer Butter Masala. Took Fish Tikka and Chicken Easily Butter Masala for takeaways. They were fingure lickingly good! The Fish Tikka had a curious taste, not a conventional one, but satisfying. The paneer butter masala with extra blobs of butter was totally fulfilling. Even the chicken was well cooked. With the help of an efficient service crew, no doubt this place is doing wonders since ages! Highly recommended!

[Intro]
This place is very famous,heard about this place quite a long back,but never able to went there.in past i went there several times while crossing the road came to mind have to try this,somehow not happend,few days back went there,it was around 3 o'clock.the time I went there,the remodeling part was going on in the main ground section.asked one of the restaurant stuff is there any availability for eating right now,he told me in the first floor section you can eat,as this is my first visit I don't know about the first floor section.well the place was quite big,big tables with six chairs.a shaddy atmosphire,the foods smell coming out from everywhere of the section.around at a time 50-55 over seating arrangement.
[Location]
The place is located near rashbihari,near kalighat metro station.the road towards going on new alipore area,3 mins walking distance from the metro station.
[Foods]
1. Chicken Biriyani - it was full of flavour,comes with one portion egg,potato and chicken portion too.a bit oily what i found,quite good quantity enough for one persons,used proper amount of masalas,the flavour was amazing while served in the table.rice they used was good quality.both the rice and chicken were cooked well,egg and the potato also well boiled.taste was good.
[Service]
Overall service was quick,because the time i went there lots of people there,i was really hungry that time,but they served really fast.
I would like to visit again this place,because they have sone singnatures dishes which i didn't tried yet.will visit soon,all the very best everyone.

Finally tried the much heard about Tadka Fry. Well it was different and good in that way. But to be very honest, I could not find anything mind blowing into it. I have had better tadkas in lesser known restaurants; even few of them out of town. Furthermore, the prices are high considering the amount of tadka they provide.

I am certainly looking forward to it again hoping for a better experience.

Well Bachan's Dhaba is a classical example of a pocket friendly restaurant. We ordered rumali roti, tadka, Alu do piyaza, boondi raita, papad, kulfi and the bill was ₹207. If anyone thinks that they serve sub standard food then let me tell you that you cannot say word about the taste of their food, it is so damn tasty. Just one negative point would be the fact that thus is not an AC restaurant and the staffs are not like the ones you get in a fine dining restaurant. A must visit place for all of you who wants to eat good food at a reasonable price...

The dhaba has a massive renovation.I had visited this place almost 2 years ago and now it is completely changed..More Polished,more comfortable. Ok now coming to the point of food,my friend and I have ordered Masala Kulcha, Rumali Roti and Paneer Butter Masala. Kulcha is awesome and paneer butter masala served with dollop of butter on the gravy making it more yummy.We took away fish tikka, chicken reshmi butter masala for our home.Fish tikka was unique in taste with ajwain and fish fry kind of taste and chicken reshmi butter masala is as always finger-licking good.Lastly the Dhaba is pretty much affordable for pocket.

since i am from new alipore , i have been here for many times. tasted almost plenty of items of which latest was the chicken tandoori . cost is reasonable and pocket friedly. quality is just over average . quantity is good . i have tried their mutton biryani for a numbur of times nothing special in it . similar to roadside biryani shops . never ever dare to try the paneer tarka its just horrible. i would say their non veg items are better , specially the butter masalas not to mention the naan . overall an average restaurant

Nowadays we are regularly ordering food from Bachan's Dhaba through Swiggy. So it is obvious that we are getting to know this food outlet quite well. Their kababs are good particularly chicken tikka, tandoored outside and juicy inside. Now for the gravy items, basically  there are 2 types of cooking, one salty another salty but with a sweet tinge. Mutton kasha is salty but the other 3 items in the menu, mutton korma, mutton fry and mutton masala are the same cooking, with same taste. But the greatest blunder is their lachha parathas which are not lachha at all but a big size leather. That leather was 40 rs piece. We threw them into the bin and brought out left over rice from the fridge to finish our meal.

At an hungry noon,i came up in Bachan's Dhaba with two of my friends Sourav Das and Maity.our stomach was in intense need of food and our pocket was running out of big notes. 
The ground floor was under construction,so we went to the 1st floor. That's quite spacy. Though the decor was not Upto mark,we didn't care as our eyes were stuck on menucard. Keeping an observation on our pocket-we ordered chicken Biryani,rumali roti and chicken reshmi butter Masala(full). Waiter was friendly and quick @ their work. After 15 min our food hit the table. Impressed as the butter Masala was served hot. Tasteful the dish was..the Biryani was asusual in Taste;though the Rices were hard s bit. Probably the Biryani was cooked long before.
Overall our bill reached ₹400(2 less).
Undoubtedly less for 3.

The only time I liked having food here was when I had their Tandoori Roti and Butter Chicken.The Tandoori Chicken was okay.I would specialy forbid people to have Biryani here.Its HORRIBLE.
Warning- You might sleep off before the food arrives.

Though there is parking problem as on the main junction but one can park in the lanes and also the gotel people have good relation with the cops. The outlet is still under rennovation and guess its coming in a big way with ample space. We had tandoori ruti rumali ruti mutton fry chiken reshmi butter masala and thums up. The tates are authentic but too spicy and oilly. Price wise value for the noney. If you are foodie and give a damn to spicy and oily stuff then this joint is the appropriate one. I would recommend.

Bachan's Dhaba rated 3.4? Criminal! Anybody who has ever had their tadka fry, chicken tikka masala, saag fry and kababs would go back again and again and again to relive the taste! Portions? 1 plate of this heavenly tadka fry can stuff two hungry souls! Prices? Unrealistically dirt cheap compared to the taste and quality and in perspective to a place like Bangalore! Do not go by the average rating, visit this paradise to believe!

Located at Rashbehari crossing, this place is quite famous. Its located near my place, so no need to say that I am a regular there. The food is good provided the price you have to pay. I just love their Tadkas. Though I found the biryani to be a bit oily, their other dishes are good enough. Now they are renovating into a multi cuisine restaurant, so hoping for a better rating next time I go there :)

Hands down real good food. Close to home and my favorite. Love their tarka dal and kebabs. Chaap is okay. Tikka chap is substandard. 

Parents love their Chinese too. Kolkata style no fancy simple goodness.

Not a place to sit down and eat. They are renovating bottoms up. Would advise take out.

Don't miss tarka, romali roti and delicious kebabs.

There was a time,when eating out,which is so commonplace now,was not so.

There were people who visited the park street eateries and the clubs but for many middle class families in late seventies and early eighties,take away from the Bachan hotel as it was known then,made up the weekend dinner.

This place has memories.....of when every penny counted and how friends pooled in to have our chicken tandoori after saving enough for the bottle of rum.

This place has always served great tarkas,especially the egg and the mutton ones being outstanding.Was happy to see they still have not lost their touch.

The Tandoori chicken was unnecessarily spicy and the mutton Kasha too oily but what the heck....this is a dhaba after all.

Long Live!!!!!!

Situated right at the Kalighat junction, this is another place that brings back fond college memories. This is actually the perfect college lunch/dinner place, where dishes are available by "half" portions and that is how I got hooked to it. They do make a decent Biryani, but the must have items here are their Roomali Rotis with half a plate of Chili Chicken Dry on bone and half a plate of Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Top it off with a glass of Masala Thums Up and you will burrp away to the goodness of Dhaba food. Highly recommended for college folks.

They donot charge extra for the complimentary salad with kebabs. No VAT and service tax. The outlet has an old school calcutta charm with a view of the road and adhunik ( modern) bengali songs of hemanta mukherjee. Overall good food, good service and good music.

We had ordered rashmi kebabs, palak paneer, tandoori rotis, basmati rice and lassi.

The food was decent enough and tasty. The cost was economic.

This time I ordered half chicken tandoori which was crispy on the outside and juicy and tender in the inside. It was served with pudina chutney. One of the best tandooris I tasted.
Chicken bharta: this was decently cooked and tasted delicious.
 Mixed raita- was average.

Aha! The Bachhan's Dhaba is a mast dhaba which whips some dumdaar North Indian and Chinese delicacies to it's people! The sweet corn soup can compete with any authentic Chinese restaurant and the  malai kebabs and the haryali kebab and the tandoori chicken is lip smackingly tasty! The dal takda is to die for and so is their gravy chowmein. The Biryani, though is a let down. 
Come here to celebrate food and diversity with all it's deliciousness but if you are someone who freaks out at the sight of every drop of extra oil, sorry bud this is not your place!!! ;-)

A good joint located in Rashbehari Main road if you crave for Chicken Tandoori , Tangri Kabab in starters..You can go for delicious egg tarka and decent biryani in the main course..I have mostly done take aways from here. .

Fish tikka, chicken tandoori and tangri kebab took the cup away for bachans dhaba. 
Apart from their regular tadka bharta and biriyanis, mutton keema tadka is too good.

I visited this place a couple of days back with friend. At the moment, they are going through a renovation so the place is a bit messed up with the sitting arrangements shifted a floor above. Nothing much to talk about the ambience as it's temporary but the food quality is decent of not great. The service is a bit delayed but understandable because of the work going on at the spot.

We had Chicken Bharta, Plain Daal Tadka, Mixed Veg and Tandoori roti and it was not as good as I expected but did the job as it was raining heavily and I was hungry.

I hope, they gear it up soon and start serving something better.

Bachan's Dhaba is serving cheap mughlai and punjabi dishes to Kalighat and adjoining areas, food wise I have tasted their Biriyanis nothing special about it. In the Rice platters they serve specially during lunch time. I have once ordered for Fish and Rice which to my surprise the Fish Curry they have prepared was adequately tasty. Coming to the rolls they prepare during evening time is same as that of other adjacent food joints. Even tried their kulfi that was also very ordinary in taste.

dont know what others would say about this place but i didnot find any problem here. I loved their food, they prepare chinese and mughlai really really good within the range of our pockets. recently they are working on their ground floor getting the unfinished works done. when i visited the ground floor was without any use. we have been shifted to 1st floor. that day were searching for MUD, it was highly unsuccessful. then finally we decided to visit this place. never expected the quality of their chinese dishes can give really tough competition  to the popular good rated chinese restaurants. mix noodles i thought would be very ordinary but noodles and chilli chicken just proved me wrong.once i had chicken curry and laccha paratha. another day tasted tikkia kebab. their kebabs are highly recommended. i personally loved. not all the waiters were friendly. i found no issues either.

Bachan's is the place to be when you are craving some good food at cheap prices. Located adjacent to the Kalighat metro station on the road toward Chetla/Alipore.

Been to this place since my childhood and my favourite always has been the tandoori chicken and butter chicken. Service is good but the ambience is not very good since it's in a very busy road.

I wld call this place a budget hot spot.... Quiet favourite place to dig in whn pockets are on ventilation... Thr is no such thing called "ambience" here, its always crowdy whether its the ac section or the non ac.. So the funda is have ur food make way for others as fast as possible. 
Now coming to food, they serve both tandoor nd Chinese dishes nd north Indian as well... I have almost tried everything on their menu except the seasonal items... Their other items r ok just like any other ordinary restaurant... Bt I simply love their tarka items they r really really good .... Nd the other best ones are mixed veg nd matar paneer... Simply fantastic.  If u have a sweet tooth u can have their kulfi falooda its quiet good bt I prefer their masala thumbs up.... Its totally burrrrrpy!!!!!! 😁

Situated at the Rashbehari Crossing, this place eluded my attention for a long time, until last year, when I decided to take Chicken Reshmi Kabab, and Fish Iranian Kabab. And I found both preparations really good.

Last week, I was home and I was deciding in which Restaurant I should venture next when I thought about Bachchan's again. Tried Chicken Tangri Kabab, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Boneless Chicken Sagg Fry with Tandoori Roti in two nights. 

And awesome is the only word I have for them. Value for money, check. Great service, check. Great food, check. What more can anyone ask?

Definitely recommend it to the people of South Calcutta to drop here and taste the Boneless Chicken Sagg Fry.

Located at the rashbehari connector, this place can be well accessed from any part of kolkata. This place once used to serve only punjabi food but now it has started serving mughlai, chinese cuisine. The prices are very cheap and affordable. Taste is pretty good as per the price list. Every item has a touch of punjabiness in it. The kulfi faluda served is very tasty and it serves as a delicious desert after a meal. 
The place has both a ac and non-ac department. But the prices are not very varied. Ambience is very casual and staffs have a good behavior. On the whole a pretty good experience.

Located right next to Kalighat Metro, this place will never attract people's attention. But, like they say, never judge a book by its cover. This place will serve you some amazing North Indian dishes at a very reasonable price. The Biriyani and the Egg tarka is simply mouth watering, and so is there Kebabs and Tandoors. Once tasted coolfi, there..it also was a nice one. The rating is solely based on the taste of the food, the ambiance or the decor is not much to write about, but the food is definitely worth a try.

My rating for this dhaba (one of the oldest) goes only for the quality of food they serve. Chicken tandoori, all types of kebabs, rolls, tarka, chicken and mutton gravy items all are delicious. Even the tea, lassi & kulfi are mind blowing. The Chinese items are decent too. Only I cannot assure anyone of the biryani. It has scope for improvement. The price is quite reasonable and there is an AC seating area too. So, if any day one is not willing to cook at home, just drop down here and enjoy the food even if u have very limited budget.

Well this place has achieved a legendary status in the south kolkata domain, thanks to its rich history and finger licking delicious food. Have heard good reviews of this dhaba from the preceeding generation and the generation before that too. So lots of nostalgia for them. As for me, i have frequently visited the place and have always liked the food and the prompt service. Aptly priced food and the taste sinply makes it worth your money. And the kulfi is an added attraction. Do visit if you haven't yet. At least for a roll if not a full course meal 😉

Well this is one of those typical standout places for Punjabi food lovers..This is is a no frills attached joint basically, might not be suitable for people looking for gorgeous decor or fine dining experience but for those whose main motto is delicious food at a budget rates..Whenever I visit this place I feel like gorging on my Tadka Roti combo..simply lip smacking..Their signature items include Chicken Tandoori,Chicken Reshmi Kebab,Mutton Fry and Chicken Bharta..Almost all their items taste supremely delicious,tangy,spicy,a rich oily gravy..Their Tadka (all types) are to die for..A piece of onion,few chillies and tandoori Roti..thats what u need with it..Apart from Tadka I personally adore their Mutton Liver dishes..Lastly the prices at which they serve surely deserves an applaud..Generally I prefer take away from here,though they have a separate A.C. family room..

It serves all typs of food from chinese to tandoor to indian. It s famous for its biriyani, tadka, n kebabs.. I don't like their Chinese food much. Prices are reasonable. I love their kulfi.

Bachan's dhaba is a good place to eat in in various aspects which i would rate as below
Ambience: 2.5/5
Taste : 4.25/5
Ratio of quantity to cost : 4.5/5
Must try Items : Egg tadka (all other tadkas here are awesome) 
Tandoori roti is also very nice (more of atta)
This place is a must try for following reasons:
this palce is lively hustling with customers ; pakka dhaba style of serving and billing ; and the items are freshly made and this place is very economical as one can come out with high satisfaction with low investment

The huge hoarding bearing the name of the dhaba is so very welcoming at the crossing of Rashbehari. The place has a typical flavour of  a casual dhaba serving some good food. We ordered chicken chaap and dal makhani with tandoori   roti and salad. The rotis were quite heavy but got very hard in a short while. Food was satisfying as per its cost as all these dishes with 4 tandoori roti cost us just 232/- !! Dats cool right :-)

Rather for students this dhaba will definitely get special attention coz its really pocket friendly. N seriously compared to the quality of food they serve price is really reasonable! Tarka was really good just like any other popular dhaba! Paneer & tandoori roti was extremely soft! However the ambience was nothing exception but the food is good enough to ignore it!! I would definitely suggest all students to try this place. Lastly do try the lassi there.

A very popular joint located at the Rashbehari More opposite to the Kalighat Metro station. This dhaba has a big banner in red with it's name written and one who passes by this eatery can never miss the banner nor the seekhs with meat hanging in them. I absolutely love this place and have been here several times. This is a very ordinary dhaba with minimal decorum but when it comes to food you can trust this place with everything. They have both a.c and non a.c sections. The food here is brilliant starting from the biriyanis, tandoori, chicken reshmi,  tikka kebabs, the tarkas are really good. I am not very fond of their chinese dishes though. The amount they give is appreciable. The biggest attribute of this place?it's a super cheap eatery. When your pocket pinch is not sound and you want to eat junk your heart out, swear by this place. You will not be disappointed at all.

I do not know the exact number of times I have been to this place. There is nothing that I hate about this joint. Whenever I an near kalighat, and am hungry and want to hog at super cheap rate, there is no better option than bachchhan's that can actually save you. I have been introduced to this joint since 2001 and have been a fan ever since. People love the biryani out here, but I kind of find it too oily. But what is good and unbeatable are the kebabs. The malai kebab, the reshmi kebabs are definitely killers..and the chicken tandoori I would go on eating and eating. The chicken butter masala with a dollop of butter tastes amazingly yummy and on teaming it up with a butter nan, you are bound to get transmitted to a heavenly solace. I am in love with food out here and will keep on visiting this, till this dhaba shuts down.

We went to this restaurant for two consecutive years during Durga Puja. They don't have all items on the menu at lunch-hours (that too at that time of the year), and we got the same response both the times when we asked for Tandoori Chicken. 
Coming to the food, it tastes pretty average, we liked the Chicken Bharta more than everything else. 
Service is prompt and good.
The ambiance is quite dull and nothing to deserve a special mention.

The first time I visited the place, I came out even with out ordering food. The AC section was poorly cleaned and overcrowded. And after waiting for 20 minutes no one came to take order.
Last night me and my friends went to the place coz we were getting late to find other restaurant of our choice.
The ambience and decor does not call for any special mention. It's a overcrowded place especially on Saturday night.
Now coming to the food. We ordered the rashmi kebab and hariyali kebab both of them were accompanied by nice green chutney which came the plate itself not in a separate bowl. The cucumber in the salad was how ever bitter. For the main course we ordered tandoori roti, roomali roti, keema matar, special mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani.
The tandoori roti was chewy and tough, roomali was ok. In the keema matar we hardly felt any keema, however the taste was good.
The blow came when we started having the biriyani. The rice was under cooked , under spiced and over salted. The mutton and chicken both were tasteless and tough. The rice was full of colour and zero in taste. Surprisingly the special mutton biriyani came with our an egg.
When the bill came we countered the waiter and he admitted that the biriyani was finished and they had to make a quick arrangement for the orders. And there they did all the blunder.
My friend told me that the biriyani is better in normal days and what I experienced is an exception however I beg to differ.
It's a one time go place. Good for quick bite on roti and curry. Avoid biriyani.

Went there on a lazy Sunday morning around 11.30 am. The dhaba was just open, most of the items were not available. I opted for a takeaway of Biriyani and Reshmi butter masala. When I returened home after an hour or so I found that the food was still warm and fresh. Both the items tasted good and I must say that their service was quite prompt. The place looked okay, though I would prefer takeaways every time I visit them. Price is quite pocket friendly, I especially liked their half-plate option for the side dishes, with 4 pieces of chicken in it.

Every taxi wala in kolkata will suggest you this place if you are a daal lover. "Tarka" is one preparation that you will get in kolkata only, its a little dry and with a distinct texture and flavor. Amazing stuff.

This joint has been there for ages and somehow it manages to keep up the quality of food it serves!! It is thé place for Tandoori Food.. When you at at a joint that is pocket friendly as well as serves delicious food, you hardly feel the need to take a look at the decor.. The ambiance isn't exactly restaurant-like as people mostly stop there for take -away. But I really wouldn't mind enjoying my Chicken Tandoori with a glasses of lemonade, there!  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there today... Again.

It's great  for take away only. Bad ambience, dull decorations, and rude stuffs are just unbearable. But u Will forget all about those once u grab their chicken tikka butter masala and tandoori chicken. Delicious is a less adjective to them.

They have had quite a reputation for making the best tandoori chicken in town and my recent gastronomic exploits made me realise they're worth more than just that. They make a mean chicken tikka kebab and and excellent chicken bharta but  the real man of the match is the tarka dal which truly went beyond all expectations, so much so that our bunch of carnivores kept the chicken aside to concentrate on the daal. All in all an awesome place with excellent value for money, perhaps hygiene could be a little better and home delivery option is a must.

This is one of the Punjabi hotels in my neighbourhood and thus I get the opportunity to visit here frequently. They serve almost all kinds of meals. The orders they serve are good for the appetite, specially Tandoori Rotis with Paneer butter masala! It is also a very  pocket-friendly hotel in contrast to its counterparts.

Food: Very economical and considerably tasty dhaba food is available here. Quantity is also sufficient. The rumali rotis, egg tarka, palak paneer and chicken bharta are really good. Chinese items are below average. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: It has both A/C and open non-A/C sections. It's not one of the high profile prim and proper dhabas. It is a typical roadside dhaba built into a restaurant with very basic chairs and tables. It is not ornamented at all. The A/C section is cleaner than the non-A/C section. I rate it 2.5/5.

Service: They are very fast. If you are hungry and you need food immediately, you can rely on them. Staffs is very well-behaved. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Very reasonably priced.

Overall, I rate it 3/5.

D only saving grace around Kalighat for foodies lyk me, dis dhaba is situated a few yards from d metro kalighat metro station at rashbehari avenue. Dis dhaba is true to its nature lyk any odr dhaba. Nothing fancy about its decor, d outlet is divided into two sections - an outside non a/c section and an inside a/c section. Dis place always boasts a good crowd on a given average day. 
Coming to d food, their biriyanis are always a treat, be it quantitywise or qualitywise. Dey always provide a sumptuous piece of meat in their biriyani. I specially love coming back to dis place for their chicken kassa. Dey make one of d best chicken reshmi kebab, which can be considered their speciality. They also serve chinese food. I fell in love with der bone chilli chicken and its best when had with their roomali rotis. Their service is well enough for a busy place like such. Waiters are always ready to help you select the best dishes, especially if u're a first timer. This place is also very good for a quick bite as they make lachchedar rolls. Would be very gratified if they change the timings of the roll corner(4 pm onwards).
Overall, i would lyk to give it a 3.5 rating..

Situated at rashbihari crossing, this dhaba is a true value for money. Went there today at around 3:30pm following our hunger pangs... 
Ambience- nothing great.. A moderate eatery with both ac and non ac section. Clean and hygenic.
Food- a real treat. We wanted kebabs bt it was not available. We ordered for tandoori roti, rumali roti, kadhai chicken. The chicken dish was yummy. It consist of 4 good size chicken with minimum bones. The gravy was perfect for my pallet. Moderately spicy and less oily. We also ordered for kulfi faluda which was a real hit. Cold kulfi in this cold weather made my day.
Pocket pinch- we had to pay rs. 238 for our order. 
We left the eatery with full stomach, contented heart and no pocket pinch.. Definitely in my revisiting list.

Located conveniently at RashBehari crossing Bachans Dhaba is an ideal place for a pocket friendly tasty meal.

Coming straight to the food,the preparations worth recommending here are palak paneer,mutton liver fry,chicken butter masala.The Palak paneer here is wonderfully made,so much so that this is one of those rare places where I order the veg palak paneer in preference to a host of other non veg options.The mutton liver fry contains a whole lot of mutton liver in a spicy rich gravy.The chicken butter masala with some added butter on top is also extremely tasty.Apart from these,the chicken tandoori,the tarka are also nice.All the mutton preparations are good in the sense that the mutton is always well cooked and soft.The Biryani is a bit atypical but tasty nonetheless.The one drawback is that the food in general is a bit rich and oily.But considering the reasonable price,I guess this place is surely worth a try once a while!

The place looks a bit dirty from outside.They have both an ac and a non ac section.The non ac section is quite stuffy and always crowded.The ac section is cleaner and much more comfortable.Hygiene and cleanliness is an issue.The service is swift.The prices as I have mentioned before is very reasonable.

Overall if you do not mind a somewhat oily meal at a not so clean and classy place ,you are in for a good time at Bachans Dhaba.You are sure to find the food tasty and the bill wont burn a hole in your pocket.

Bachan's dhaba is a very pocket friendly food joint and is very easy to locate. It is located just beside the kalighat metro station. Its alu ka paratha excels in every way. Fish kaviraji is another must have item over here. Service is quite prompt but the ambience is quite chaotic...may be it's because of it location. But one can't expect an ambience of a five star hotel from all food joints. But when food tastes so good all other minor flaws can easily be ignored.

GOES ON WITH THE NAME,BAD AT THE GAME.....Not more than 2 years ago bachan's dhaba served quality food at pocket friendly prices,one could swoon over the butter chicken or the reshmi butter masala or the the biriyani (the list goes on) but few recent visits changed the mind of the this foodie here.To name a few ,the service has become slower,the naans are served burnt most of the time,the preparation lacks the punch it once had,the biriyanis are too dry.
But still one of the pocket friendly restaurants out here in ballygunge.
Had been a huge fan of this dhaba and still stick on to the memories when they served delicious food.

However the food turned out to be quite good actually. Had chicken tansoori,butter naan and palak paneer. All of them tasted good. I even ventured for taking away a mughlai biriyani. It was average. However its a damn cheap place. They have an ac section inside so do not get put off by the looks.

Located at the Rashbehari crossing is Bachan's Dhaba. On an afternoon when you are hungry as hell and you don't want to spend much Bachan's Dhaba is the ideal place to go to. The prices of the dishes are really pocket friendly and the quality served is adequate. The front section is non air conditioned but they do have an air conditioned section in the back part. The restaurant is very clean and the orders are served quickly. So without spending a lot from your wallet you can eat a lot.

Went to this restaurant today for lunch. It's located near kalighat metro station towards chetla. The ambience was very poor and the behaviour of the staffs were very casual. Their sitting arrangement was not systematic and you have to share tables. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, tandoori roti and mutton korma. Kebab was not that good , chicken was not tender enough. Tandoori roti was hard too. The only worth item was the mutton korma, it was juicy and the meat was tender. Overall an average restaurant to visit.

The inner air-conditioned seating area. It was spacious and well-lit. Service was quick and the staff, courteous.
Coming to the food, I was not really satisfied. 
Since it was evening, my parents went for Egg Chowmein with Gravy. I opted for Tandoori roti and Matar Paneer.
Their noodles was horrible, with nothing but a truckload of shredded cabbages, julienned carrots and runny gravy. It was almost as if they just dipped the noodles into the gravy just before serving. No amount of tomato sauce and pepper powder could do anything to improve the taste.
As for the Tandoori roti, it was well-sized, but a little chewy. I'm guessing it was the temperature that cooled it down much earlier than I could eat, but then again, they could have given it in a basket. The Paneer was good enough to be had with the Roti as well as the noodles. It had no extraordinary taste, however. 
I remember, some months back, I had tried out the Biriyani. It was a little oily, but fragrant and delicious. The Chicken Roll, on the other hand, wasn't that good. The kebab pieces inside were too small and less in number. I've had better Rolls elsewhere.

After a loooong time I came to this place. I used to come here often with my friends during my school years. So obviously have some weakness for the spot. Finding the place is not a big deal. It is situated right at the corner of 'Rashbehari more' towards Chetla.
Anyways, I think the restaurant remains nearly unaltererd from the last time I visited. Same color, same chair-table and same smell ;-P. Only the menu prices have increased. But thats obvious!!! I do agree with those who have some bummer for the look of this place. This place looks tacky. But then again if you are thinking of going to a dhaba, which have both good and cheap food then this is what you get. I think Bachan's is a good dhaba. The 'mutton liver kasa', I ordered, tasted really good. But I just loved 'chicken butter masala'. The big chunk of chicken was so soft that you can even swallow without chewing. I just loved it!! Quantity was good too. And serving time was okay.
I have seen people going for chinese in this dhaba. Man.... if you wanna have chinese then why going to a dhaba!!! Their chinese are not that gr8 too. I really don't understand this. So except from this typical group, I will recommend this joint to all those, who want to have proper good punjabi food at cheaper rate and don't have any problem dining at an old restaurant. Happy eating :-)

This place is not at all suitable to be classified as Dhaabe di Shaan category as of now..but i assume it's because it had its days of glory. Try not to eat there, the place is quite dirty being situated at the roadside. I have never ate here, always got my food packed. A couple of times, due to lack of options and extreme hunger i have had tikka rolls, which are okayish. But the best thing they serve is probably the Chicken Tandoori..It's a winner. My  rating is completely due to this fact. The place is quite cheap and may save you from hunger when you don't have any other options!

Okay, firstly this is a "Dhaba", so please don't ever go for chinese food here. North Indian is the call. Donot let the ambiance or decors deter you. A very pocket friendly place and the dishes taste better than most other places which sell north indian cuisine at these prices. Both quality and quantity are satisfactory. Surely a place to eat in, if your pockets are tight and you are hungerstruck (and you are somewhere near rashbehari avenue of course)

Well... BACHAN'S DHABA!!. Perhaps I'm visiting this place since I was in class 1 i.e. from past 13 years. The first time I dropped in to this place cause of its favorable location which just adjacent to kalighat metro. Since then I visit this place almost regularly. Now coming to its taste. As the name suggests "Dhaba"- it could create an impression that it perhaps only specializes in north Indian and to be precise in Punjabi cuisines, but I am afraid its not. Along with the time, this place on today's date offer almost every type of cuisines which the proud people of Kolkata Savior's from CHINESE to NORTH INDIAN then MUGHLAI. Just drop in and there is 99% of chances of finding what your heart in craving to treat upon on their menu. Till date I have tried almost every genre of dishes at this place. But if someone asks me rate one cuisine over another of this place, then I would have to say "North Indian"(Punjabi dishes). Such as their variety of kababs(chicken reshmi/tikka/boti etc). Along with that the " CHICKEN TANDOORI" of this place is just DEVINE in word. It can compete with any posh restaurant' quality and taste at any time of the day. As compared to its taste the price is almost nothing and to be honest quite cheap. Their other N.Indian delicacies like tarkas' specially (veg.tarka) is just succumbing. When it comes to Naan, Lacchha paratha, kulchas etc are quite a savory too. Biriyanis and chaaps over here are of moderate taste and quality though it cannot compete with legends of the town like Shiraaz, arsalam etc. But if you are nearby kalighat and wanna treat your taste buds with mughlai legacy with out making a big hole in your wallet this is the place to buy your plate of biriyani.
But when it comes down to Chinese dishes- its par below what you would expect after tasting their north Indian foods, though its not something you cannot give a try. But the excess amount of oil which they use in chow mein and fried rices just doesn't goes with the Chinese side of your taste pallette.
This place has both the facility of A.C. and general sitting arrangement. But their interiors and cozy ness is far away from what you expect on 2014. The waiters are quite carefree and inhospitable as well, so if you wanna avoid such issues but still wanna enjoy your N. Indian cravings you can take away your treat as mostly  60% of the customers prefer take away from this joint.

This hotspot of Punjabi cuisine has the distinct advantage of being located at one of the most strategic locations on Rasbehari crossing,catering to the need of hungry souls for more than 40 years! Set up by a sardarji taxi driver, this dhaba once boasted of simply authentic punjabi tadkas at vastly cheap rates. But with time,they have upgraded the joint serving biriyani, chinese and a whole lot of other stuff. I have been here hundreds of times and this happens to be a favourite take away joint on sunday evenings for my dad. The egg tadka remains their best dish. You can also try mutton tadka and mutton do piyaza - both are thick,hot,spicy preparations not meant for the ones on diet. Tandoori or rumali roti is better than having kulcha or nun at this place. In veg, palak paneer is one dish into which they punch their panache . No meal at the bachan's will be complete sans the keshar kulfi which is adorable compared to its price! Overall, a good place if you are hungry, ambience may not be one for a well planned date or a family dinner but a definite 'must try' if you are with friends and looking for a pocket friendly siesta with wholesome punjabi cuisine!!

There is nothing special abt this dhaba. Fail to understand how come zomato classify them as Dhabe de Shaan category. Its utter nonsense. We took home delivery twice from this restaurant rather eatery n both times we were unhappy. Even the chicken they served in the butter masala gravy was under cooked. If u cant cook chicken, you should not call yourself a cook. Shame on you! !!!

Conveniently situated near Kalighat Metro Station at the Rashbehari crossing, this restaurant caters to the needs of the gluttons and the gourmets alike. 
It was the Durga Puja time and we friends decided to have dinner from this place. Little did we have the prescience that after standing in a long queue for over an hour, what would cause our eyes to dilate was an unclean and aesthetically unappealing food outlet.
Nonetheless, we decided to try out:
(1) Butter Naan
(2) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala (Full)
(3) Chicken Tikka Butter Masala (Full)
The Butter Naan was soft and fluffy when hot and fresh (though it grew hard to chew as it started getting cold). The flavours of the two chicken dishes that we ordered were discernible. They do titillate your gustatory senses. However, the tikkas tasted a tad over-fried. 
Talking of the staffs, whether it was due to the load during the Puja time or for something else, they were a bit clumsy when it came to serving and handling the dishes. One of them even spilled a Chicken Manchurian dish (ordered by someone else) onto the floor and showed no urgency in cleansing it up.
This restaurant is still the most sought-after place in one of the busiest junctions in Calcutta. But unless some radical change in their code of hygiene is brought about, I'm apprehensive about them maintaining the reputation they have earned.

I love bacchan's dhaba!!! It's one of my favorite place, starting from dal tarka, to chicken tangri kebab, its too good!!! At the end try out the kulfi also.

One of my fav food joints in kolkata cz I have lovely memories here...we always come here during puja but u hav to sure cz their will be a queue outside of the restaurant! !

FOOD-- almost every item is good in respect to quality nd quantity.  Special mention will be CHICKEN TARKA nd  CHICKEN RESHMI BUTTER MASALA. I am just addicted to them here. naan's are also good. 

DECORATION & LOCATION-- location is one of the advantage of this dhaba. Jst beside kalighat metro station, rashbihari avenue. . Coming to decoration it is quiet average.  They had two sections ac and non-ac.

There is another advantage that they dont charge extra vat. . So it is good place for friends or family outing  ..

The classic dhaba, with a modern twist. You have a tandoori joint for the kebabs and rolls. Then you have a place for sitting, with an ac restaurant inside. Located at a prime location, the place is always packed whether its 7 pm in the evening or 1 at night. The prices are reasonable and the food quality is unbelievable. Simply the best rolls in the area.

This place is a must if you are a regular near Rash Behari avenue. I've had countless take-outs from this place, whenever I've passed through that region. Tarkas are their speciality, especially the Egg Tarka and the Mutton Tarka. The tikka kebabs are nice as well.

This place is such an integral part of my college experience. We have never demanded a classy ambience. Just give us a place to sit with some simple good food and we were happy as clams!!
The fried tadka is the best in Kolkata. A plate with their softest Rumali roti and you will polish it in 10 mins I can garruntee!! The tadka is spicy and delicious with a hint of chili. It never dries out and coats the plate. I loved their palak paneer. The chicken butter masala is good. So are the kababs. The chicken tandoori was very juicy. The place is a no frills place with some good food.

Have been here once last year when I was around Kalighat metro looking for food.
Was feeling hungry and so I ordered more than I could eat :D Paneer Butter Masala and Paneer kadhai. 
Quantity was good and reasonable to price, the taste was good as well however lacked little something. 
I couldn't finish it as was full and wasn't disappointed with this experiment at all.
Can be given a try.

Location: Rashbehari Crossing. 

This place is a stop for most of the Bengalis, reason being it's delicious non-vegetarian fare. :-) 
Am happy to say, that people visiting this place care less about the ambiance and more about the quality of food it serves. 
The ambiance out here is quite simple, with two sections, one being air-conditioned and the other non air-conditioned. 

Being near to my place, have been here a lot of times and have tried almost all of the vegetarian dishes this place has to offer. 

To be short and sweet, this place serves good quality food at quite a minimal pocket pinch! 
The service is quick as well. 

On the negative, just that, the hygiene level is average.  

A good experience until now.

One of the most visited dhabas in South Kolkata besides Azand Hind Dhaba this one is well placed near Rashbehari Crossing. The variety is good considering it to be a dhaba. The staffs and waiters are friendly enough though there is nothing special to mention about the ambiance. Tried some Chicken Tikka Kababs in the starters and Laccha Paratha with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala in the main course. All of them was pretty good and nothing to complain about. The chicken pieces was well cooked and was soft too specially the kababs. The green pudina sauce with which they were served was just about perfect and tasted well.

Located just opposite to Kalighat Metro station (towards chetla) they have the dhaba outside but there is a AC restaurant inside.  I have been to this place quite a number of times and they never disappoint me. 
                             I have tried only the Indian dishes prepared by them and they are all fantastic. The Mutton biriyani with a chicken chaap deserves special mention. The piece of the mutton in mutton biriyani is always perfect , the  piece of the potato is also perfectly cooked by them each and every time. I love their Chicken bharta also, they are really specail with butter nun or kulcha. You have to try their Malai Kofta too.Even they will make happy with just their tarka and romali roti . But whatever you take as your main course, as dessert you must take their kulfi which is strongly recommended.  The only thing is that the ambiance is just average but then it is  it is tidy enough for a dhaba. And last but not the list one of the most pocket friendly restaurants in that area. 
Good food + good price = Bachhas Dhaba = Would never get bored of their food and would come back again and again. Love this Dhaba!!

the only reason to deduct marks for this place is the ambiance... other than that this place is like really good... compared to other so called dhabas in town this place is kind of cheap and the food is much better and does not make you fall sick the next day (bad experiences).... 

the food is spot on with the paneer tikka being soft and tender and the masala on it was fabulous... the paneer butter masala is very good... but the fun is to have the palak paneer out here... you see in normal places when palak is cooked it leaves a slight bitter taste in you mouth.... but here this problem i don't know how they have removed making it an amazing preparation.... i suggest the normal tadka or the egg tadka which is very good... 

this place is normally over crowded and we have sat there just once.... never took the chance again cause even in the AC section the tables are some what dirty and sticky and the plates and spoons are not to be trusted (yes i am a little finicky about this)... have packed food quite some no. of times from here and they have never let me down as per the food...

all in all if its good food at a cheap price this is the right place for you but you have to sacrifice on the decor and the ambiance of the place in totality

Its a good restaurant, though nothin special. Such food can be found in most of the similar restaurants in the city. There is one restaurant right beside Bachan's which has the same offerings with almost equal taste. But still, if you are in the area, this is probably the better choice amongst the others in this price range. I have to say the chicken tikka butter masala was something I liked perticularly. To end it, you can have a kulfi, which is very good indeed.

this is one of the most visited dhabas by me ..i have been here for many birthday treats and sometimes when we had no other option to go..located juz opposite to the kalighat metro station..this is a dhaba from outside but at the same quite a nice ac restaurant inside..

i have mostly preferred their chicken biriyani with adequate amt of chicken ,boiled potato and egg..i really like it..their north indian food consisting nan,tandoori roti,chickn bharta are also a special mention..while they also make chinese bt that is not that good as i have tried their hakka noodles once..
i lovèee their kulfi..for many a times have gone there juz to have kulfi..:)
management is good..servers are a bit slow..yet a nice ambience and a good dhaba wala atmosphere with some great food in a pocket friendly price..like it alot!!

Various kinds of dishes are available from chinese to Indian. There are two sections in the Dhaba. One Ac and the other Non-Ac. The food is the ac section is naturally costlier than the other section. Service is prompt and quite good.

**Location = At rashbihari more, just beside the Kalighat Metro Station Gate towards Chetla.

**Breif = Have been there many a times to try their Special Biryanis,Nuns,Fried Rices and specially their Kulfi :P
I remember a funny experience, it was during this winter, TB became dramatic and needed to have Kulfi in that chilly weather and not getting Kulfis in Gupta Brothers, our saviour became the Bachan's Dhaba :P and we ended up having 4 Kulfis that day :D

**Ambience = Just like the normal Dhabas we have, but th`ey also have an AC section.
Whenever I have tried dine-in, I have preferred the AC section. But the decor is not much to mention about.

**Food = The food here is of superb quantity. Quality wise Biriyanis are the best :) With huge amount of rice, boiled potato and the chicken pieces, they serve one of the best biriyanis :)
They Chicken Bharta,Palak Paneer and Butter Nuns/Laccha Paratha is also a heavenly combo :) Oil quantity is a bit on the higher side,so health conscious people should be aware :)
Once I have tried their fried rice and chilly chicken as well, I must say it was a bad choice , as they are not much specialised in Chinese dishes. 
Last but not the least, the kulfi is a special mention. I just love having their kulfis, whether I have their food, or even if I am passing by :)

Their service is sometimes a bit slow !! But if your order regular north Indian dishes, they are quick :)

**Purse Check = Their prices are quite average and they do not charge huge taxes. I feel its a pretty nice pocket friendly dhaba :)

**Overall = Good food + good quantity + reasonable prices = Thats what dhabas are for !!

My father on many occasions has got food packed from here.The food has got home,still hot and fresh, best part. I have sampled their kadhai paneer and it tasted okay( a lot on the oiler side), the paneer tikka however was still better. The dal makhni is good.The chana masala was nice and palak cream was excellent.The breads here are prepared just about okay.
PROS: Good to average food, pocket friendly
CONS: Sometimes food is oily, lacks innovative dishes, breads need to improve.
But overall it is an ookay joint located in rash behari.

Went there just a 6 months earlier for a birthday treat. Food is good. I specially felt nice to find the absence of dalda. Ambience is average. They have two divisions- AC and non-ac. So if you are not comfortable in dining in non-ac, you can pay few more and have a gala time enjoying the food in the AC.

I was at Bachans Dhaba last week, and inspite of my mother turning her nose up at the thought of eating in the non-AC section, with the so called "unacceptable standards of hygiene, ambience and service" (her words not mine), I somehow convinced her to let go of her inhibitions for just one evening. We ordered a dal fry, garlic naan, jeera rice, veg jhalfrezi and paneer pasanda. The paneer disappointed me the most the pieces were hard and tough to bite into- the dal was not too bad, the naan not worthy of special mention. But the veg jhalfrezi won my heart a thousand times over! Looovved the aroma, taste and texture. The doodh cola was as it always is- EPIC. The bill for two (we hogged so much and yet couldn't finish the food) came up to only 550.

Another one of Kolakta's celebrated dhabas along with Jai Hina, Azad Hind and Sharma's. I never recommend take-away's or home deliveries from dhabas primarily because the naans or rotis or parathas are bound to get cold and in turn hard and chewy. I have sampled almost all their chicken and mutton curries and I have liked most although some of them are a little too similar to each other. The chicken tikka kebabs and chicken hariyali kebabs are my favourites here which are a typical fiery red and a dark green in colour respectively. The lachha parathas are nice too. The outstanding combo here is definitely the roti and tadka. 
My favourite table is in the non ac section, a table in the middle which gives one a view of the busy Rashbehari Avenue. Order and eat there if possible. This kind of food is best enjoyed hot and while the breads are soft.

A budget place, Bachan's Dhaba has served me well since school years. I savored their Indian preparations, although the biriyani was never great. It looks noisy from outside but the AC section inside is neat enough. Of late I have ordered takeaways a number of times. My recent experience hasn't been great because of the very tough tandoori rotis they serve. Otherwise, value for money I must say.

This was my first dine-in in the new year.I sampled the butter naan,chicken kasha and the evergreen favourite items-egg tadka. Firstly the naan was really soft,fluffy and piping hot.Only issue was that it was dripping wet with butter-enough to scare away the calorie conscious folks. The chicken kasha was a standard gravy dish comprised of a single large piece of chicken.Thankfully the gravy was not fiery hot but salty for my taste.But no issues at all with the egg tadka. It was purrrrrrrrrrfect to say the least.
The ac section was closed -may be for renovation.Non-ac section is as expected chaotic and sharing of tables with strangers  is the norm.Prices are pocket friendly.Total amount came to Rs 210/-.
Well this was my dine-in visit to this Dhaba after ages.I went in the AC section as the non-ac section was packed to the brim.Needless to say like in most joints, this section is much cleaner and quieter.I had the tandoori roti, roomali roti, plain tadka and the paneer kadhai. The tadka as is the norm in most Punjabi owned dhabas cannot go wrong.It was very well made and tasty. The paneer kadhai had plenty of paneer cubes soaked in a fiery red thick tomato puree gravy that comprised of sliced onion and capsicum.Typical dhaba style dish.Meant to be consumed by dunking your roti in the rich flavour some gravy and there you go- pure bliss!!!
Prices are pocket friendly, service is prompt,hygiene issues exist and food is on the greasier side.Not a bad bet at all for an urban dhaba experience especially during the wicked hours of the night.

----- 10 Aug, 2013 -----

Well if you are passing by Rashbehari crossing and experiencing severe hunger pangs then look no further. Bachan’s dhaba is your one-stop solution in such a situation. This is a typical urban dhaba that serves a wide array of Punjabi, Mughlai and Indian Chinese dishes. And no prizes for guessing which category of dishes one should order. Recommended items are the tadka-all types, chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken tikka butter masala- both are chicken kebab items cooked in a gravy, chicken tandoori-although they tend to burn it more than required on a bad day, mutton liver items and the old favourite paneer tikka masala. They do serve tons of biriyani on any given day but prefer to have it in Mughlai joints rather than in a dhaba. 
The seating arrangement has 2 sections-AC and non-AC. Both are crowded throughout the day. One big plus is that this joint remains open till pretty late in the night. If you have female company then head for the AC section. Prices are a tad higher but it is cleaner and the crowd more sober. The non-AC section is a huge cacophony. Service is prompt. Quality of dishes is OK but quantity is decent. Hygiene, ambiance and courtesy do not exist here. Thus people whose immune system is fragile-please stay away. For the rest be prepared to fill up your stomachs without burning a hole in your pocket. Advice folks to opt for take-away rather than sit-in.

On 17-Feb-14 I went to Bachan''s Dhaba around 6''0 clock evening. At that time their A/c counter is closed. Non A/c portion is little clumsy. But we still managed to get a double seat. The ambience at the first look a little repelling. But the behavior of the Waiter is very pleasant and co-operative.  We ordered the Chicken Hariyali Kebab as Appetizer. Yes, it is awesome in taste. After first menu, all the repellence converted to Attraction. Then we ordered Rumali Roti, Butter Nun , Chicken Kadai and Dahi tadka (on experimental basis). And I must say, my experiment result generated enormous satisfaction. One must try Dahi Tadka in this place. Chicken Kadai was also very very good in taste. 
Lastly I must say, Price Quantity Ratio of the food will must bring smile to Foodie's face. I really loved this place already apprised all my friends to hang out in this place at least once. For those, where hygiene comes first, should try the A/C arena.

If you want food and only food, with no stylish seating, no personal space, no ceramic plates, no well groomed waiters....then you must head to this place. Have been going there since ages and each and every item on the Menu is finger licking good. Although I would recommend avoiding Chowmein there. I also take home Chilli Chicken, Different Kinds of Tarka, Chana Masala, etc which brings water to my mouth even while writing this review. So, all the people who are hungry after their hours of shopping and are short on cash, head to this place and fill your bellies without even making a hole in your pocket.

The AC and Non-AC parts are separate, so you can choose your own space according to your pocket. I would recommend sitting in the AC area, because there is not much of a difference in the pricing.

Okay, so I love Bachhan's Dhaba for two reasons - 1. It is one of the best places for Tadka Roti, and 2. It makes my favorite vegetarian dish perfectly - Paalak Paneer. I have been here a lot of times and every time I end up ordering Paalak Paneer. The recent trip I made here with a couple of friends at around 10 o'clock in the night was a great one. We were seated almost immediately, and although this place is not very posh, it is kept clean. I love a clean Dhaba. The AC segment was where we were seated and we were asked immediately by a brisk waiter what we would like. Our order was simple - half tandoori chicken,  hariyali kabab, egg tadka, tandoori rotis and lassi. Our food came in within 10 minutes, piping hot, and it was freshly made. I loved the hariyali kabab - juicy pieces of chicken served with a delectable green chutney. the lassi was very good - thick and creamy and delish. Our bill was very reasonable, around 550/- or so for the three of us eating so many things. Totally worth it.

The food is amazing.. delicious..  .. Best North Indian ever tasted at the most reasonable price .. It's a dhabha so ambiance is like one..
My personal likings are dal tadka.. tandoori kabab.. chicken kadhai.. mix vegetable and the biryanis..
even the kulfis here are amazing.. its difficult to get a place on weekends.. generally we have to share tables.. but the food makes up for the ambiance........

If a restaurant could be rated only on the basis of their food, then Bachan's Dhaba would have definitely been a highly rated place. However the ambiance is extremely repelling. Just like most dhabas in town, they have different seating sections for A.C and non A.C. At times the non A.C section gets filled with smoke form the kitchen. Once a friend of mine being allergic to smoke started shedding tears. Since then every time we have opted for the A.C section at extra cost. The tables are unclean and at times you may have to ask the people to clean them. Even the wash basin is not properly maintained. The A.C section fares better in ambiance though its still far below average. The service, as you might have guessed already is equally poor. However what makes it among the busiest restaurants in town is their delectable food at reasonable prices. Especially the kebabs are delightful. My favorite is their hariyali kebab. The green chutney is equally nice. Those who have been here must have noticed that the dhaba adjacent to this remains mostly empty while this place is always over crowded. The reason is their kebabs. Be it chicken tandoori or any others, the kebabs are bound to make you crave for more. The other dishes are also quite good, but they are not a match to the kebabs. I would have given this place a 4 but for the ambiance and service I have to deduct .5...

Forget the ambiance. If you are looking for a good neighbourhood food joint without any extra frills, then this might be the place. They have in recent years put up a very small AC section, but the entrance to it is through the shabby front old section. The crowd is mixed, with a lot of people sitting there who might forget their food if and when a girl enters the joint. A lot of cab drivers frequent this place for cheap food. The service is also not much to talk about. 

Saying that, food is good overall; especially the Tadka preparations. 

You might consider going in with friends, but not if you are looking forward to a premiere candle light dinner.

Good makers of Kebabs. I have also tried the Biryani, but it didnt taste as good as it appeared. But charges are very economical, so step in anytime with any number of people. Remember to order atleast one kind of kebab. Surely all of you will enjoy!

One of the few good places to eat which doesnt burn a hole in your pocket at and around Rashbehari Crossing, Bachans Dhaba has been around for ages. And if you are in the mood for a sumptuous punjabi meal, this is the place to go. The menu offers all forms of popular dishes with a special emphasis on the Chicken and Mutton. Abstain from biryanis as you can always have them elsewhere. Focus more instead on the typical flavours of punjab with chicken korma and saag fry. The mutton liver is exquisite in its richness. There is a large range of items in the veg part of the menu too. The paneer tikka and tadka dishes are delicious to say the least. However all this may still dampen your mood as the food is always late. The waiters are courteous though and will profusely apologise repeatedly ( Happened the last 5 times ) The ambience is plain, more like a typical highway eatery. But its a nice place where you'll always find a jovial family crowd. The price is average, which is quite something if you've taken into account the posh location. A good place to take your friends.

Chakraborty Tip : Be careful while ordering. They have a habit of providing you salad along with your meal even though you haven't ordered it. Its all fine until they charge you for it.

This place is located quite close to where I live. Its more of a take away joint for me - sat and ate there probably twice. Overall, the food is isn't bad. Its cheap as well. Its open till late in the night as many others have said - so if you're in the sudden mood for having rumali rooti and chicken chap at 10.00 pm  this is the place to be.

Heard a lot of good things about this place from a couple of my friends who live in and around RB Avenue. Well honestly , this is nothing special other than the fact that you get decent food pretty cheap. Also the fact that it is open till late in the night so if you are late you still get to eat something. The food in itself is just above average and I dont remember the man at the billing counter to be very friendly.

I had heard a lot of praise about this place, but to be honest, the whole experience wasn't really up to the built expectations. Even if you leave aside the decor, ambiance or the service quality, the food is nothing extraordinary. The restaurant is superbly located, and provides quite inexpensive food, which is a plus considering the posh location. But overall, it's not one of my recommended places to eat out.

I live very close to bachan's dhaba and i've been to this place several times..If u r low on budget and like tasty spicy foods near rashbehari then u opt for Bachan's Dhaba.. Dont look for ambience and cleanliness here.Just njoy ur meal. Since its a dhaba obviously the punjabi items are preferred than others. It remains also open till late night.So if u r late back home within this area u can get try for dinner here. I give a mere 3.5 due to the reasonable price and tasty foods(which might not be healthy) .. :D

Bachan's Dhaba is one of the most pocket friendly family restaurants. It serves both chinese and north indian. there are two sections- ac and non-ac. the food quality is good enough to visit there several times. i like their kebabs and tandoori most. full tandoori just 200 bucks!! unbelievable!! they also serve chinese but i dont them at all. seasonal punjabi food like makkai roti is also available during winter. service is very quick and dishes are all time available except the seasonal ones. i stay at rasbihari so i visit there  frequently whenever i get bored with my food at home.  the most famous serving of the place is tarka and roti. hundreds of employees and even filmstars come for their tarka. though they check out with their drivers carrying the packs to the cars. the crowded atmosphere may be not be suitable for everyone but if it is so then they can afford the ac section. this is a class dhaba so we cant expect to have five star qualities from it but whenever we have some bucks in our hands we can go there a enjoy the food.

                        Bachans Dhaba: a Dhaba located near the rashbehari crossing serves awesome punjabi food and various kebab items. It is unhygienic and is not maintained properly it is run without proper changes. Yet it caters to the Bengali public who love chicken items. It is good for non vegetarians but not a good idea to eat out for vegetarians. People who are not diet conscious and who wants tasty punjabi food at reasonable prices should go for bachans Dhaba as they use too much oil and butter. One thing which disappointed me was that there is no parking place in front hence cause a lot of trouble for people who to eat out by cars.

They have improved a lot over the years. It has also expanded its operations. Nowadays, it is providing super fast food delivery and the quality has improved quite a lot over the years. Their combo meals are doing wonders now.

Bachan's Dhaba is an less than average place , which is mostly favoured by taxi drivers or people looking for once in a while takeaways . When we were teenagers we would possibly eat in there during puja night out if all other nearby restaurants were full . But I dont recall doing it since we started earning ... meaning it is just a cheap place-  not great food quality , very dirty sitting area and less than average service .
Located bang on Rashbehari more , it does stay open till pretty late at least till 11:30 thus helping you to get items like chicken chap or rumali roti if you are having a daru party or something like it.

My last experience with them was quite bitter.. or should i say hairy, ordered a mixed chowmein and was served with a garnish of hair, got it changed, yet again found one. so..... if you have a good digestive system and want to challenge it, they are always welcome to give a great time. rest i gave a 2 because although the food was greasy, it tasted ok

If you want AWESOME FOOD at a very REASONABLE PRICE then this is the place you need to visit. But if you are looking for ambiance and refinement, you may go elsewhere. Bachan Dhaba is my favorite dhaba from childhood. I have been visiting this place for more than 12 years and the food is still cheap and tasty, just the way it was before. This place is always bustling with activity, people coming in and out and having their delicious meals. A no-nonsense dhaba for the real-foodies out there. Thumbs up to the dhaba culture it represents so truly.

This is an unassuming, no-nonsense place that is meant to satiate hunger, and is not a place where you would go to dine out. If you are near the Harish Mukherjee Road or S.P. Mukherjee road crossing with Rashbehari Avenue, you might be inclined to try it out. But if you are looking for better options, I would suggest places like Ta'aam for Mughlai and the nearby Hatari for the oriental spread.

The helpings are substantial. The food quality is good but not exceptional. There is no sense in talking about the service or the decor. The air-conditioned section is better (if you find it open) but is also priced higher. Stick to the basics like chicken tandoori, which tastes more roasted at times than it ought to, but it still is nice. The helping of the biriyani is very good, though there is much room for improvement in terms of the softness of the meat or the flavour. They don't serve firni, so you can settle for a traditional kulfi if you want to.

Verdict: A decent meal at very cheap rates, around Rs. 150 per head (3$).

This place used to spell comfort food for us. We would usually start off the fare with hariyali kebabs (mostly tender and juicy). In the main course we would have rotis, anda tadka butter fry (would be charged an extra rs 5) and chicken reshmi butter masala. The reshmi butter masala used to be the star draw, having us mop up every last bit of its creamy delicious garvy with our rotis. 

However of late, the food has begun to be a bit too greasy and heavy on the stomach, due to a less than average cooking medium perhaps. So be prepared to pop an antacid post dinner. Overall not the eat out kind of  place. More of a locality dhaba kind of a place.

like other holidays,got a table for four  after 40 minutes of waiting..as usual the Chicken tandoor and rumali roti re very delicious,may be the tandoor chicken with pudina chatni is best in the city.one of my friend ordered chicken biriyani which was mediocre.I did not ignore her choice bt my personal suggestion don't ever try biriyani in a Punjabi dhaba. it's the tandoor they do superb. as the chicken hariyali kebab in bachan's dhaba,it was it is and it will be delicious!!!! :)

awesome tandoori chicken. i keep on recommending the place to everyone who lives nearby. last time we visited in summer. the tandoori chicken was great to enjoy sitting in the air conditioned  wing with a bunch of friends and some soft drinks. the worst part is when you can't enter the place but you have to pass by its side every day to catch a bus from rashbehari crossing....one piece of advice to all, do not try any of their Chinese dishes. the rice quality used in fried rice is that of pulao. you can also try their chicken kabab roll. it's tasty and wholesome.

Finally a hot-spot for us...Nice place if you want to pack some food and take away. We normally get some preference in seating here when we come and the A.C part runs well...It is cheap, good food if you want Indian food or tandoori and one of the very few options for such food at such low prices. 
The chinese is not at all exciting and preferably give it a miss and go for the Indian. Helps if you want some food with your liquor or are too stressed out to cook something late at night since it is also normally open around till 11:00-11:30.
It is not as was stated a place where you expect fine dining and the decor or the cutlery is not special but the food is....
Try out the Chichken Reshmi Butter Masala or Tikka Butter Masala....These are the kebabs in curry. You can also try out mutton Korma, Mutton Do Piaza and Chicken Kadhai...These are all good orders. The tarka as expected from a Punjabi eatery is awesome. Even Paneer tikka/Kadhai/Butter Masala all are good options if you are looking for veg. You can also try out Veg Korma and Mixed veg.
The kulfi Faluda is also good so its good if you are looking for quality food at cheap price but the place is not good for a nice night out or romantic dinner and one look at it and you will know that.
Some of my friends really like their chaap and biryani but I do not like it's taste that much. So you can risk it cause except me most like the chaap here while I settle for my favourite Reshmi butter masala.
Had the decor been better it would have deserved a five star from me but since it is the best option in the range it received such good stars.....They sell huge quantities so try to hit early if you have preferences.

You might as well overlook this not so sophisticated dhaba but if you have had the food you would not think the same. This place serves excellent Tarka and Tandoors. My personal favorite is the Mutton tarka. The Chinese is pretty average.. you can give it a try if you want. This is not a fancy restaurant. The ambiance is not that great, very cheap. If you are looking for fine dining..this is not the place however if you look for good food you can definitely try.

great value for MONEY place is the heart  of kolkata namely reshbehari , try out all their kebabs they are delicious & this place is really friendly on the pocket  , if this dhaba  had a  bar licence then  it could have given stiff  competition  to the likes of OLYPUB, coming to food    apart from kebabs one may try mutton liver  delicacies with naan or tandoori rooti . only letdown for me is  the biryani which  is average but overall  a must visit  with family &  friends

One Sunday we tried this Punjabi Dhaba to taste their rustic food. since its located at Rashbehari , the outside of this dhaba is very crowded.... so one thing I would like to say that the problem I faced...was with the Parking of my car.

We had their Chicken Chaap, Biryani, Kebabs, Kadai Murg & Tandoori Roti. Chicken Chaap was really awesome out of all..

Real Value for money..... and also dont think it to be like open dhaba... as it has provision for both AC and Non AC places to sit....!! :))

Real value for money. And the kababs are wonderful - can give much expensive resturants a run for their money. 

However, the seats in AC section is limited - and sometimes you may find that the AC is not working. But you can forget all these - once you eat the kabab and see the not so burdening bill.
