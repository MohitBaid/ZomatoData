Service is very poor. Untrained staff. Delay in service and they serve you cold stuff specially biryani.. only recommended if you have no other option.

Well it's small restaurant in parnasree. The food is good. The taste is descent enough. Only the biggest problem is TIME. They make you wait like crazy.... M sure you come here.. place order.. go for a looooooong walk.. come back.. and food will not be ready yet.. minimum wait time is 45 mins.. no matter what you order..  You'll definitely die with hunger. 
Well the home delivery option is better here. So if you stay close by and you feel like eating out better place an order here rather than going mad waiting for food at the restro.

Awesome place, good ambience and certainly tasty food. The best thing is that I came to know this place belongs to a retired chief engineer of merchant navy. Having known this community closely, I am sure that this place would be different from the other food joints in terms of hygiene and quality of food. These people would not go for any cheap ways and means to earn a few bucks. 
Regarding the food, the taste is very good and competitive with any Resturant's around park street. However you get a few benefits over park street restaurants: you save travel time , get easy parking and it does not pinch your pocket. What more do we want .. "peth bhi khush aur pocket bhi". 
Highly recommended to the foodie guys .. enjoy.

The ambience of the restaurant is very good !
Quality & quantity of food is excellent at a very reasonable price .
Lucky to have such a restaurant in this locality .
However , improvement is required in the Service at the restaurant though home delivery is quite satisfactory .
Indian food is impressive , specially for vegetarians . I would strongly recommend Tasty Bites

Worth value for money ¬†.Chinese and north Indian food both are ¬†equally good . ¬†But Serving time is on the higher side on weekend due to too much of rush and home delivery. Therefore, it is better to keep time in hand if, you are going to this restaurant at week end.

Based on information from my fiend , I visited this restaurant. ¬†Found Awesome food. Chines and North Indian both are equally good. I happened to meet the owner of the restaurant, he was more interested in Quality and taste of the food than earning on food. Service was also prompt. Parking was not the problem at all. Hotel is located at the Ground Floor of the Hotel Sea Castle. Restaurant as well as hotel both are well decorated.

Recently I visited the restaurant along with my friends for a get together. All of us liked the taste of the food .We never thought that ¬†such tasty food could be available in an area like Parnashree. Taste of all the Paneer items and Masala kulcha was awesome. The ambience and service was too good. We decided to have dinner in this restaurant rather than going to Park Street area in future , as because there is no parking problem in this area and pocket pinch is also half of that of park street area for the same quality , quantity and taste.

Very bad experience ! Ordered at 9:20 PM and was informed that it will take 50 mins to get the same delivered. But Delivery happened only at 11:00 PM. Despite following up continuously , the person informed that what if it is delayed ?? Its a Sunday and it will be delayed only !!Further, there was an issue with the Dal ordered and when we called , they said that they are sending somebody and when called at 12:15 am , they said they can send only some helper . Eventhough, earlier I had food almost 9 - 10 times from their restaurant , this experience has shattered all the good will . To worsen the issue, we had fed to kids first and had to ¬†give them medication. This response is not at all expected !

Staying in a place like Parnasree, one can never get a posh restaurant as found in the rest of the city but luckily this new spot just opened up recently and we could not be more thankful. The interiors are lovely, just adjacent to the Hotel. A relatively small place but decent in accordance to the area. The food is really good and not overpriced either making it a place for fine dining. I would however recommend it to improve the service since it was late and there were not more than 2 waiters. Also, when you have fancy names for your desserts in the menu, please make sure you haven't run out of stock and disappoint your customers. Kinda pointless having such lovely desserts on the menu when you don't even have more than one ice cream.
