A rather cozy place. Service is good. We ordered plain rice, Sona mug daal, jhur jhure aloo bhaja, topse fry, daab chingri & Kochi panthar jhol.

Rice - good.
Sona mug daal - full of water. 
Jhur jhure aloo bhaja - okay.
Tose fry - excellent.
Daab chingri - very good.
Kochi panthar jhol - tasty but spicy. A little pricey wrt quantity.

Overall a good experience. Can be improved.

Yesterday I have ordered Chichen fried rice, Hot garlic chichen & schezuan chicken. Both quality & quantity are very good. Taste is awesome. Both the chicken side dish are little bit spicy but taste is soo good. Overall its a good experience. Its my 1st time to have some food from this restaurant....... I wish to prefer some Bengali foods from this restaurant, as it is basically a Bengali restaurant....

Food quality is not good that much. I have ordered daab Chingri and got some rotten pieces of prawn
. Not value for money. Foods are not that much tasty as it should be.

Located between Chinarpark Bus stoppage and CC2 , its a nice looking cozy place for dining. At first glance you will notice its quite clean and well maintained . Staffs are prompt to response. Lets talk about the menu. The menu consists of variety of Bengali and Chinese dishes. Tandoori cuisine has very few options in compare to other two. My food experience is very unique here. Few dishes which I have ordered are excellent and few are very average. My recommendation is Chili chicken dry, Shanghai Chicken, Bengali Prawn preparation and Chicken Kasa.  Service is very prompt and its quite pocket friendly.

Had a home delivery. Ordered katla tomato aloo jhol, kashmiri aloo dum and rasgulla.
A thumbs up for kashmiri aloo dum. It was yum. 
But the fish curry was pathetic, or rather tasteless. Same with the rasgulla. 
Overall poor food taste.

Ordered plain rice, sonamug dal,beguni and dab chingri. Dab chingri tasted brilliant. All food reflected flavour and taste of bengali cuisine. Satisfied. It's zomato rating should be atleast above 3.5. Hotel management should take care of this for improvement.

Ordered butter tandoori roti and chicken Reshmi kabab and the food was good but could have been better. But overall a nice family restaurant and the staffs are super friendly and down to earth.

We had ordered chicken Kosha, Roti and green salad... The chicken kosha was pathetic.. We never had such chicken kosha before.. Tasteless full of salt.. And these ppl they dont even know how to compensate the mistake ...  For us this was our first visit and surely the last one too....
Thank you 'Henshel' for serving us such pathetic food.

went for a family dinner near cc2 .. not very well known... may be because of the locality. cause its not in chinarpark nor in cc2 just inthe middle noepara....tried chinese cuisine over here ... good one...  place is ok. ambience could have been better. average hospitality. ordered fish manchurian , chilly fish grave, hot garlic chicken, rumali roti, tandoori roti , veg fried rice, chichen hunan fried rice. all are having decent taste.... food cost is also reasonable in terms of quality n quantity. can try if u t hanging arround city centre 2.  keep it up... onnly the masala papad is very bad in taste .. asked them already to make it proper ...

Hensel - A unit of "Rishav food product"... "www.gayensgroup.com"...after having food, i had paid the bill using debit card.. swiping machine was not working, due to some server issue or might be some other issue with network..so, i made the payment using debit card, first time it showed 'host error' and again 2nd time, Hensel has swiped my card and payment was successful... but i have received 2 messages from icici bank for 2 different transactions, so 240 got deducted twice from my account. And i showed 2 messages to Hensel and also showed my bank account transaction details, where it was shown that 240 has been deducted twice from my bank account. But Hensel didnot pay me back 240/- because the same did not appear in their swiping machine..i requested them, but still they decided not to give back. Hensel is quite a big restaurant, and i have received worst behavior from them.. Hensel is using swiping machine, which is being provided by canara bank. #Hensel #Rishav_Food_Product #Gayensgroup #Canara_bank... Coming to food, mutton biryani - rice was okay but mutton was worst and fish finger was very worst
