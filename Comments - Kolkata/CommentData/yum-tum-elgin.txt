The food is pretty ordinary...had ordered grilled chicken sandwiches...it was smeared with excessive mayonnaise...delivery time was long...price was also a bit on the higher side

Located inside the forum food court this food joint looked appealing enough,so we ordered pan fried momos.
Horrible pan fried momos.simply terrible taste.we really thought it would taste good by looking at the appearance.But alas!I thought it was overloaded with vinegar and my Friend thought it was overloaded with chilli sauce.so yes it was a total diaster.
