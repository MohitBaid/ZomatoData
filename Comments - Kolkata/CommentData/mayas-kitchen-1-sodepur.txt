Small inn just located on sodepur crossing.. So small that you can't even figure outüòù ( that's wat happened with me) any way... It is just where the autorickshaw stops while coming from rathtala.the best thing over here is the pizza's with a really pocket friendly price! We had BBQ chicken pizza.. They give you ample amount out cheese and loads of chunks of chicken. And we even had a "bambay ka badapav" which actually don't tastes like badapav but more like burger... Though it was really tasty üòç!
It's a must visit for every foodie!

The best quality pizza with enough chunks of chicken and full of cheese at reasonable price is available here. It soothes my tastebuds much more than any dominos or pizza hut pizza. If you are really looking for hot pan pizzas full of cheese in it within 200 bucks... surely need to pay your visit here.

Maya's kitchen is a small eatery located just near Sodepur more. They serve a delectable range of pizzas and burgers at affordable prices. The side dishes are also good. The cheese garlic bread there is really good. The problem with this place is its unhygienic location and untimely opening of the shop. I have had to return a couple of times as the shop was closed. So I recommend you call them before turning up. Otherwise great place for students.

One of best pizza's I ever had! I' ve visited this place quite a number of times and am a fan. Located just beside the peerless inn, it's a small shop which can be hardly noticed. But the pizza, burgers and sandwiches are finger licking good. The club sandwich is yummilicious!

It has an awesome service, mouth watering food at a relatively cheap rate. Reminds me of my school days when we used to go there and hangout.

PIZZA !!!!! BURGER !!!!! if you are traveling on B.T Road then this is the best place for burgers & pizzas... i know there are quiet a few domino's bt in case of topings, crust & price... i will say Maya's Kitchen is the correct place... they don't have a very good place to sit & eat... bt the food quality, quantity & taste is awesome so i will suggest to have the in your house...bt if u wanna seat & eat then definitely go bt it can be a little uneasy to eat

This is the best pizza option in our locality...pizzas come at a low price but high on taste and expectations.... They make really good full of chicken and cheese piazzas..... I think better than the pizza restaurants like pizza hut or dominos...I have tried their fiery chicken pizza ,chicken salami pizza ...nearly each and every variety...

This has been an amazing place ... I have visited this place quiet a few times ... Basically its a western fast food type kitchen... One can have pizza ,burger,cold coffee and many more.. the quality they‚Äã serve is too good man i mean previously i didn't like pizzas so much these peoples have forced my mind to change,just mind blowing dude... I had pizza previously in dominos , pizzahut but these people are at some another level ,not only the quality of food is good but also the price is reasonable... 
I prefer someone who is fond of westside stalls please visit this place once...

A very cheap restaurant which sells a great variety of pizzas and burgers. Located just near the traffic signal of sodepur,panihati and hence very easy to locate. The best part is it makes delicious pizzas and burgers at a bare minimum price of Rs 100-120. And most importantly they don't make the bill heavy by charging huge taxes unlike dominos and pizza hut.
If you are a resident of Sodepur and yet have not visited Maya's kitchen, let me tell you, you are missing something big time.

I just loved the pizzas here.!!
Absolutely yummy and beautifully garnished.!!
The portion size is extremely attractive as well as the price which is extremely economical.!!
Why go to domino's and pay extra when you can better items here.?
Also try the chocolate shake and the cold coffee with ice cream.!!
It's lip smacking.!! ‚ù§‚ù§

A small joint near the Traffic More, Sodepur offers quick bite items like pizza, sandwitch. Been there few months ago, when the shop was not registered on Zomato, so was little bit surprised to see such a small food stall on Zomato.
They don't have any sitting arrangements. Few chairs were there. You have to seat outside taking those chairs.
We ordered two types of Pizzas(Can't memorises those names) and one Choco Shakes.
Both Pizzas were tastes good and the Choco shakes were really out of the world. Overall a good satisfaction wala feelings from such a small food joint.
