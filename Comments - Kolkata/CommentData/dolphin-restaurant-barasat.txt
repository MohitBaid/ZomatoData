New restaurant here at Barasat. We had chinese. The quantity was adequate, ambience minimalistic. Overall good experience. Would love to try out other items.

New outlet of the one located in BT college. Came up in place of Blossom restaurant, which was quite a hit in barasat for competitive pricing, good quality and quantity. This one is Pretty average though, ambience bad, crampy sitting(just redesigned the previous restaurant but same outcome) , could have decorated better. Mutton Biryani , bad, mutton pieces were hard, rice grain was short, not the good quality long grain. Fried rice was comparatively better. Chicken was average to a tad better. The pieces were of moderate size, but the taste of gravy was good. Eight pieces though, even in higher standard restaurants, they give 10 pieces, price was â‚¹200. Tandoori rotis were not upto the mark, the sides of rotis were under prepared. Maybe this was due to the mass scale cooking during puja, but that shouldn't be an excuse during any time! Will update it after a second outing and see the difference, if any, from puja season.

This is new resturant in place of blossom..
Decoration is not so much good.. just simple one.. food item quality and quantity is good but not so tasty.. and most important thing is
The price is exclusive of GST.. that means the price mentioned here is not the final price. You have to pay GST accordingly.. so in this way the price is becoming high.. if the price listed has been included with GST then the price may be justified but actualy it is high while adding Gst..

This is a new restaurant in Barasat area. They have an outlet near BT College. This restaurant has come up in place of Blossom. I used to be quite frequent at Blossom bcoz of their food quality, so i went to Dolphin with high expectations. One surprise was that they were giving a 20% discount on food and beverage as their promo offer. I ordered a chicken manchow soup and chicken lollipop. The soup was'nt great quantity wise, soup bowls are meant to be larger. Also the quantity of chicken in chicken soup should be more. Taste was fine. The lollipops were good. They provided a fiery sauce as the dip which went well. Overall, this should be a decent restaurant.
