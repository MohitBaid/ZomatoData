The Chaiwali is one of the most affordable additions to the chai and coffee places in Kolkata. Location is great, and so is the coffee. These people are selling most of their hot beverages under INR 20, and we rarely find anything to sip at this price at similar outlets in Kolkata. So, whether you are a student on a tight budget or a office goer craving a cuppa, this place wouldn't disappoint.

The Chaiwali also has some biscuits to go with your chai/ coffee (2 nankhatai for INR 10 is good)!, and some savouries like puffs and sandwiches. Service is quick.

We had the filter coffee which was recommended by almost every reviewer, it was good but nothing extraordinary. Overall, all their items can be safely tried.

Pocket pinch-
Filter coffee- INR 18

Decent masala chai at The Chaiwali. Very reasonably priced, ranges from Rs 20 to 30/-. Filter coffee could have been better,  portion size could be slightly big, it gets over in 4 to 5 sips

This place is an example of how branding and good stuff can come at decent price. Located outside tollygange metro station, this place draws attention by its name. Every other thing offered here is great. The nan khati biscuits, Christmas cake makes a perfect compliment to tea.

Masala tea was okay but the filter coffe is too good at that price, highly recommend.

Decent, clean outlet right outside the main gate of Tollygunge metro station. I am fond of the filter coffee. Snacks are delectable too. This place will satiate your hunger without burning a hole in your pocket!

A decent kiosk selling tea & coffee inside AMRI hospital. Milk tea & filter coffee worth a try. Main thing is hygienic tea & snacks. Prices are very affordable â˜º.

A decent kiosk selling tea and coffee outside Mahanayak uttam kumar metro station. Their Madras filter coffee is worth a try and so are the nankhatia biscuits. Prices are very affordable and stuff is of superior quality than the things available at similar prices in the area. 
Worth a try for me.

Love this place ! They freshly brew their beverages and the savouries are yum too. The highlight is the prices. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for their daily fix of caffeine. It tastes just like home :)

One must have their chicken sandwich and cheese n corn sandwich. After a long day office, either of the two will definitely make you feel good. Needless to say, all the food items are prepared nicely and seem to be fresh. Located absolutely adjacent to mahanayak uttamKumar metro station, opposite to the Wow Momo outlet. Chicken kathi roll is also good and worth the money.
