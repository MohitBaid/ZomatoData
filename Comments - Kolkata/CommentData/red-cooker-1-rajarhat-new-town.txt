Being a vegetarian i ordered from Red cooker and they make sure that they keep non- veg dishes separate and never mix them...they delivered food within 30min...the quantity was too much...Taste is execellent...i request them for healthier version so they put less oil in every dishes...
Value for money...actually they are new in business n their main aim to satisfy and make new customers..if they r maintaining their best i am life time their customer for sure....
