Their low pricing is really appreciable. The joint appears no different from a hundred other similar food joints, which deliver same stuff at higher prices, particularly biryani and chaap.

Ok.. so I savored their stuff twice. Their chicken items are really good, and due to fast selling, probability of left overs / stale stuff is negligible. But can't say the same for mutton. The mutton chaap packed for me, was a hunk of bone, with a few shreds of ligament, in a gravy. Not a chaap at all. A waste of money. 

So I guess if one sticks to the chicken items, one can't go wrong. The cordial behavior of the counter person and other staff is also a plus point. Even with my delicate digestive capabilities, I did not face any issues.. So go ahead, Wah Taj!!

The rating is just because they dont have any seating .
And the menu can be improved.
I love their Mutton biriyani and chap and the price is also very very reasonable.
You can have your dinnr within 150 only by take away.

At okish place if you are craving for random biryani within a 100 meters in that area.The biryani served there is good and very economical. Mainly popular among few college students.A good rating only due to the lack of choices in the vicinity

The taste of d biriyani is not so bad... It's a perfect choice for the school or college students.... The prices are cheap.. the quality of the biriyani is satisfactory... Whenever I suffer from shortage of cash, my first and last choice is particularly this takeaway counter

This Taj Biryani outlet probably has known my family personally for the frequency I visit this place. And every time we wonder, how can anyone manage a hearty quantity of Biryani with chicken and egg for a mere 70 Rupees. The taste is not extraordinary, slightly heavier on the spices but is decent enough in terms of quality and quantity. Highly recommended if you look for something pocket friendly, hearty Biryani....

Value for money.  Biriyani is very pocket friendly. Try once if you haven't tried it at all. It will cost you just rs 70. Biriyani is awesome. I just love it. Everyone should try their biriyani atleast for once.

I wouldn't say the food here is anything excellent, but then it serves its purpose. Its kinda oily, spicy and with lots of Masalas, but the quantity being good, the Biryani-Chaap combination can be tried once in a while to satiate the crave for Mughlai food.

A true and honest review. Three of us went there to have biryani at around 5 in the evening as we didn't have lunch that afternoon. A day later, all three of us were in our beds the entire day and were not even able to move out of them. Nothing else to say.

Tried their biriyani on the opening day itself. I remember crossing the outlet without any intention to even stop by and look at the menu..but the aroma was so deliciously strong that I had to order myself a plate of chicken biriyani. Man the taste was good! Since that day have tasted their biriyanis and chicken items quite a number of times..sadly their quality has deteriorated. Biriyani tastes bland..found eggshells on the egg few times. That's really gross! So no more biriyani for me from here atleast.

If you're looking for "The best take-away Biryani service" in the area, then this is the place to be at! Definitely one of the best places in the areas which actually makes good Biryani! Perfect flavouring and just that perfect amount of masala which was the icing on the cake(here Biryani üòÇ lol). Pretty fast service, and overall good quality, thumbs up from my side. Keep up the good work.

A-1 Taj is perhaps one of the best take away biryani joint in and around this area.
The biryani is a bit on the spicy and oily side along with a good tender piece of chicken in it. Pocket pinch is minimal for the amount and the taste of the food.

One of the best takeaway biriyani in this locality. Decided to have biriyani for lunch and thus bought 3plated of mutton biriyani, the amount was enough to suffice the appetite of five. The pieces were soft, succulent. We really enjoyed the taste and the flavouring. I prefer biriyani was is less oily and moderately spicy., this biriyani was according to my expectation

Heard good reviews from the locals staying near to this joint...so I went there...place is prety ordinary local type..I didn't feel like sitting and eating there...so i Got a chicken biriyani parcelled for myself...it had 1pc chicken and 1pc potato and an egg and the quantity of rice was good enough, apt for a person... well I saw the rate and it was quiet cheap...a chicken biriyani at rs. 70/- imagine...well with that price it was understood that I shudnt be expecting anything extra ordinary... And yes after eating that I felt that I was pretty much right... Nothing great about the biriyani...it tasted like those road side stall biriyani available in Dalhousie office para..sorry, little better than that.. :p but still not good...well, I shudnt be complaining though as this is the quality one can get for that rate... :) 
I don't stay in that tollygunj area so I am not gonna go there again just for a plate of biriyani...

Located beside the Azadgarh post office, the A-1 Taj Biriyani outlet has come up just a few months ago. I had chicken biriyani there for take away. They give good quantity and also include a boiled egg. Keeping the price in mind, its very good value for money. The biriyani tastes quite well too, though not outstanding. You can surely give it a try.

The food quality is degrading. I have had their biriyani since the shop was opened here in Tollygunge. The price is very cheap so maybe they are unable to give the quality that other biriyani restaurants can offer.

Although every thing in the menu is not available, Biriyani, Chap and Kassa is something which you can always order. Dining is not possible, take away is what i will recommend. Food is good when you compare it with the price. People in and around tollygunge can always give it a try.

Earlier I didn't used to love having Biriyani. But after tasting the Biriyani from here. It has simply change my taste towards Biriyani! One of the best!

Lets keep it short, according to the price it's really great!! You can't expect it to match up with that of Aminia or Arsalan. So it may not be the place to have your treat, but can be sort of regular or casual lunch / dinner.
