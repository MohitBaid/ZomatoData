Packed room. Air conditioned. Budget friendly. If you are two people seated at a table, they will let two other people sit at the same table as yours. This might be uncomfortable. Food is tasty. Staff is friendly.

I didn't have a sit & dine experience. Picked up a Chicken roll & the rating is just based on that. The roll tasted good and price (Rs.40) was reasonable. The staff could be little more attentive and polite.

Food is fine according to the price. Given the location it's a good hangout area for college students. Space is a problem however the ambiance is okay​. 
Do try chicken tadka and egg chicken roll.

During my college days, most of the time we had our lunch from this restaurant. Chicken lollipop(gravy), biriyani, tadka, handmade roti, chicken panfried momo, moglai, veg fried rice, hakka noddles, chicken roll, schezwan chicken- all these items are really good here. Ambiance is not up to the mark but for it's yummy and cheap dishes you can come here.

Went today with my 3friends.. We ordered 2 hot and sour soup,  and two rice combos.. We waited for almost an hour...but what came after waiting was really tasteless.. The hot and sour soup was just a mixture of chilli sauce vinegar and egg. The soup was very spicy and  we couldn't have it due to its awful taste.. When our second order came I thought this can be tasty as we were really very hungry. The combo contained a little amount of rice and two pieces of chilli check spreaded over it. The  rice was good in taste but we could not have it as the gravy of chilli chicken was spreaded all over the rice.. The gravy was also  very bad in taste.. The total bill was Rs360. But I think I hv wasted those 360bucks on a bad food..
