'Twas Christmas eve, the band that was performing around swimming pool was super in comparison to the food that was served in restaurant. Here's what we had ordered for:
1. Lemon Coriander soup.
2. Minestrone soup.
3. Cheese and spinach ravioli.
4. Super Nachos.
5. Fresh Lime Soda.
6. Tawa Sabzi.
7. Malai Paneer.
8. Yellow Dal tadka.
9. Garlic Naan.
19. Masala Kulcha.
20. Roti.
21. Masala Papad.
22. Roasted Papad.
23. Peas pulao.
Ravioli was just not good in terms of texture and taste and as far as rest of the item is concerned they were very okay.

I had high hopes from this restaurant after looking at their name and location. Given that it's a pure vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata, one doesn't expect a horde of hungry people grabbing all possible seats and over crowding the place. Based on these two assumptions, I thought I'm going to have a good time. Had their name been anything other than "Art of dining", I would have had a different opinion. But when one calls it 'art', one expects to see art and Not the average service/menu/presentation/ambience that any random restaurant in salt lake provides. And given the pocket pinch, such expectations naturally become higher. On all fronts, this restaurant disappointed me. The ambience is not at all artsy, the food tasted average at best and least said the better about service. I went on the evening of Christmas, so there was a good crowd. Is that reason enough for poor service? Not until you set that expectation upfront and/or charge accordingly. I ordered mushroom soup which was fairly  ok, but I have had much better. Then I ordered Thai sizzler. I got Thai noodles with the green sauce on the side on a sizzler plate that didn't sizzle at all. I expected additional items on the sides, but all I got was burnt lettuce. Why did I pay so much extra for that plate? I would have rather ordered Thai noodles instead. Then came double cheese risotto. Rice quality was low, and tasted like kheer(payesh) with cheese and olives. I couldn't eat it, so I poured the Thai sauce on the risotto and gobbled it up. Oh, and did I mention all three items came at the same time. When I asked them to at least let us finish the soup before serving the other dishes, I was told food was ready and had to be brought to the table. 

Poor seating, average ambience, average food, poor service with a high pocket pinch. I'm too generous to be awarding 3 stars.

This place in Salt lake is a paradise for vegetarians! I don't think any other restaurant has so many options to try from. The ambiance is decent with spaced out seating and the lighting is good.¬†

I tried mock-tails like Lava Flow, Humpty Dumpty, Ice Spice and Mint Orange Mojito. Ice Spice is a gem of a drink that goes well along with dishes made up of cheese.
For food we tried Olive Croquettes, Tomato Cheese Risotto, Fried Garlic Noodles and Thai Coconut Soup. The taste is good and it is totally value for money. Service is prompt and you don't have to wait long to get your food.

Do try out for a nice family dinner or lunch. You won't be disappointed.

Went there last weekend for dinner. The whole place has undergone a massive transformation food wise due to management change. We ordered American corn & Veg Kurkure for starters, both were well prepared. For main course we had Malai Kofta, Paneer Makhanwala, Pindi chana all well prepared particularly Pindi Chana which is worth a mention. In breads we had Butter Naan, Masala Kulcha and Tandoori Roti, all tasted quite well. Service was prompt and efficient. Manager was very courteous and receptive. Best pure vegetarian joint in this part of the city.

After many hits and misses finally a Vegetarian restaurant which fits the bill. For me and family Dal is the dish which is the measure of any vegetarian restaurant and in AOD this was just ‚ÄòSoul‚Äô comforting. So were the rotis and the ‚ÄòSabji‚Äôs‚Äô but the other hidden gem was the pineapple raita Just the right creamy dahi and succulent pineapples. Will highly recommend the place and me being a full on Non vegetarian this veg hidden gem was a great find. Do go!!

Ordered some food from this place on a sunday evening. Lasagne, double cheese rissotto, chinese bhel and batne que cheese shashlik. Lasagne and rissotto were both great. Chinese bhel was spicy but average. The shashlik were a bit too smoky and the sweet sour flavour of the barbeque sauce was not really tasty and I felt it was also under cooked because the paneer cubes were still bland from the inside. I didn't lie his one. Thumbs up for lasagne and rissotto.

A newly renovated pure vegetarian restaurant which is perfect for a family dinner.
Today you get good food in almost half the places one visit..
What makes people remember their visit is the service and the experience that they have at the place..
Art of dining perfected  my exprience  hands down..
Loved the service,the presentation and the food no doubt was perfect..
Sometimes small things make a big difference and that is absolute true in case of art of dining..
From soups (thai coconut) to starters(veg platter) to mains (dalmakhani and paneer) ..found everything perfect..

Also we ordered a number of mocktails to accompany with the food. All of them were beautiful to look and delicious to drink, especially lava flow. Would definitely recommend to try it. Talking about ambience, the decor is simple and sweet. Music at the restaurant was very pleasant and soothing, apt to set up the mood.

Starting with the ambience: It's a really nice casual dining place. A really calm and secluded place with good lighting and soothing music, perfect for having good time with family or friends.

Coming to food : We ordered Lemon Corriander soup and Minestrone soup. The Lemon Corriander soup was phenomenal with crispy veggies and perfect taste. It was refreshing. Minestrone was okay-ish for adult liking, kids will enjoy it as it's tomato based and has pasta chunks in them.
For starters, Dahi Kebab was really good. Crispy from outside, soft from inside, a good balance in taste as well. Along with Kebab, we ordered American Corn Salt and Pepper. It was good as well, crispy and veggy filled.
For main course, Lasangna and Ravioli tasted great, these two can be improved to taste little better. (Reducing a star for main course not tasting as great as starters and soup)

All in all, the food is great and recommended. Definitely try the soups and starters. (Will edit this when I try desserts and mocktails next time.)

Finally coming to service: the staff is really curteous and kind. They're quick to respond and also serve the food quickly.

Do give it a try :)

This is situated where spice ocean was situated earlier. There are no changes in the interiors. The food is good. Tried the Kathi rolls and chilli potatoes. The potatoes were typical Chinese style potatoes- no issues with them. The Kathi rolls were average. Had the tomato and olive rissoto. This was a well made dish, and should be given a try.
An extra point to the staff, which was friendly and courteous.

Ambience is sort of okay. Feels like a low toned family friendly kind of place,witjout any colourful lighting. Bright lights and innovatively presented dishes gives it a vibe of being in a classy restaurant.

Food however is very good. All dishes  exceeded expectations as compared with Kolkata's veg gastronomy map.

Must try items - Dahi ke Kebab, Masala Kulcha & AOD Special Biryani.

It is an awesome place both to have good quality food with family and friends. There is a seperate private room which has a boofer and music system with fantastic sound quality. Go eccentric there.  Though a pure veg restaurant the aroma the  lasagna and other food got my mouth watering. The gundi pan is a must to be tried. The ambience is really good. The price is very reasonable.  Been to a lot veg restaurants but this ones food caught my by the heart. A place that is a must try.

Its a nice place to have a dinner. Ambience is nice. Seats are comfortable.The staff are really cooperative. The food is okay. Any vegetarian looking for Pure veg food (without onion and garlic) can definitely try here. There was special menu for Durga Puja. The options were a bit limited in that. The prices were a bit on the higher side compared to the quality of the food. Rajasthani Aloo Dum could have been better. Among the breads , stuffing was more than what was required in masala kulcha. Butter Naan seemed more of a chapati with butter on it.

Neat place offers veg. only. Paneer Makhanwala was decent. Soup and Starter could be better. A little pricey for liking. No alcohol and non-veg.

We hosted a birthday bash in their private dining room for around 20 ppl. The party was super fun. The room had disco lights, music system and a super cool birthday decor as per our requirements. We literally danced our hearts out! We opted for buffet lunch and even the food was pretty delish. The staff too helped us alot in making the Birthday bash a success. I really recommend Art of dining if you are looking to host a private event for around 25-30 ppl.

Beautiful place for fine dining in Salt Lake, Kolkata.
Perfect place for family dinner, specially for vegetarians. 
The ambience is classy and food is delicious. 
Service is good as well. 
The best thing about this place is the wide range of dishes that it provides. Specially for me, being a foodie, one visit wasn't enough to try the variety that this restaurant provides. 
Must haves at this place are : 
Paan cake 
Lasagne 
Augratine
Crispy channa
Hyderabadi paneer Tikka
Cheese Ball
Supreme beans nachos
Mutter methi malai 
Jhal pyazi paratha
HongKong noodles

Nothing disappointed me. Everything was tasty and worth the money. Do visit without any hesitation.
Inclusion of beverages in the menu would be icing on the cake. 

P.S : I am visiting again to try more stuff.

I have to say that salt lake is growing with many heart loving places and have to say that this is one of them.  The name was so catchy that we had to visit the place. The interiors are neat and clean and a very decent ambiance. The staffs are very well trained and they know there job best. Now coming to food, i cannot say it by words here, but rather you need to go there and taste it. They have a great variety in their menu and anyone visiting will love it. Now coming to desert we have Gundi Paan Cake and i have to say that i have never tasted such kind of paan cake ever. Overall it is a great place to dine and also budget friendly. Must try its desert.

It's a new veg place in the block. The ambiance is very clean and light. The staff is very helpful. There is a large variety to choose from and the menu will not disappoint.  We had paneer tikka and dahi ke kabab which were well prepared. In the main course we ordered sahi malai kofta, Dal makhani and Aloo tikka masala. All there were very well prepared. In breads we had garlic cheese naan and masala kulcha. Overall the experience was amazing and the food was good. Do visit.
