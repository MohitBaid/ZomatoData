This place is apt for grabbing some quick bites on the go... They make some good sandwiches and you may love the paw bhaji too.... Service is bit slow but for a quick catch with friends , one can drop down...

Everyone living in South Kolkata has some memories attached to this place. In spite of being small it never runs out of loving customers who come from all corners of the city to experience this place. The posters on the wall really give a homely feeling.

Visited this place a lot of times but never thought of writing a review. Hence today penning down a small and decent review for this take away joint.

A small take away outlet located near Vivekananda park, they serve only veg items. They are kind enough to serve you food while you wait in your car. Other than that they have place to stand and eat.

I mostly tried their cold coffees, nachos and few sandwiches. Overall their food quality is good, service is also decent. Good place to visit with your friends.

Best of luck Team Fillers !

Too bad. No value for money. Frauds. They sell stuff of rupees 10 in 100 rupees. The sandwich aren't grilled. The sandwiches are too bad. 
They sell lie in the name of sandwich. 
Please stop making people fool. 
No one pays 60 rupees for a sandwich that tastes like shit.

Staffs are not at all well behaved. Food? I lack words. Cheese Grilled Sandwich for Rs. 103 and what we get is two slices of bread with cheese in between. 
Not recommended. Not at all value for money. No seating arrangements. No AC.

This round the corner food joint is a perfect hangout place for bikers n College students. Don't expect sitting arrangements as this is a real small place serving you amazing shakes n sandwiches. I loved the cheez chicken grilled sandwich. You can simply take a halt here if you wanna chill in the summer without worrying about your budget.

If you are nonvegiterian than this place is not for you. But also the quality of food provides is horrible. Service is poor also. No sitting arrangement at all. Only two standings tables and open. Most of the customers are have to either eat in your car pr the table or find your place in footpath. More over they are taking vat & tax on that shitty food also and that is 21%. üòí totally bad experience. Won't recommend at all. Even the opposite footpath roll wala was better.

I liked this place. 
I had a tea over there.  Which was good. But cost is a bit high.
What I liked most is there is waiter standing at the parking lot and delivering the food in the car after taking the order obviously.  
The good thing is you can enjoy everything without stepping out from the car. üòä

Heard a lot of good things about Fillers. This is one of the famous places that doesn't live upto it's name. The food isn't bad. But it's got nothing that I haven't tasted elsewhere better, and at a more reasonable price. Not saying the Fillers is expensive or that one shouldn't frequent there, but there are better places.

Although once my go to place, (after cricket matches at Vivekananda Park and during Pujas), I personally feel that Fillers has gone down on the ranking scale in terms of quality in the last couple of years. There are many quick serving and "smart" cafes (as I'd like to call them) nowadays, and Fillers does not seem to be doing anything to improve its game. Feeding off on its past glory can only take it so much further. I would love to see this place bring about some improvements in the days to come.

Located next to Vivekananda Park is the "stop-eat-move" place serving the basics you would want to have in a hurry. Not a place you can have a good time over coffee or so. We used have sandwiches from here post swimming sessions and on many other occasions, Fillers has been helpful.

We ordered Bombay sandwich and some lime juice and cold coffee. The food was decent enough, thou the lady at the counter was pretty suspicious about the customers. 
Pros:
1. Good option for some light snacks 
2. Tasty
3. Not so costly.
Cons:
1. No seating space 
2. No non veg

If ever in the mood to have pizza homemade style i head over to this place. No seating as such and you stand or usually get food delivered to your car and have. 

Grab a bite when around but dont specially go there to eat. The cost for two is around 350.

A few friends came over to my place and we were too lazy to go out for evening snacks.
So; we ordered food from here through Swiggy.

Its a vegetarian restaurant.
We ordered Mushroom Pizza , Cheese and Garlic Burger, Mexican Sandwich, Chilli cheese toast and French fries.

The pizza base was very thick but there was a good amount of mushroom in the topping.
The cheese garlic burger was my favorite of the lot.
The mexixan sandwich could have been way better though.

And what can go wrong with french fries? They tasted amazing!

All in all; this place is good for grabbing a quick meal.

A very well known place among the youth of Kolkata who likes to hang around the Vivekanondo Park premises. This place has been there for quite some time now and is famous for their finger food. Their USP is the location which is a hotspot hangout zone for teenagers. The waiters take orders from your vehicle and is also served there. Their menu is very limited and the food served here is just okayish. One thing which i like out here is the Slush. Prices are not steep keeping in mind the crowd. Kind of that place from where you order some fries or nuggets while you spend some time with your friends in the evening.

Its a simple veg snack joint in the neighbourhood. Not very much to offer.

The food is as basic as it can get. 

Fillers has been around for a long, long time and is mainly popular thanks to all the young crowd dropping by Vivekananda Park for their share of Evening Adda. Some popular veg snacks that the place serves, include- chilli cheese toast, French fries, cheese & garlic burger, masala/butter corn, pizza, etc. These are basically the things I order when visiting. 

The main attraction though are the slushes.

A surprise visit from a friend on a sultry evening like today called for some good food. Too lazy to step out of the house, Swiggy came to our rescue! We ordered snacks from this joint and it made our evening, more so because, ghor ey boshe khawar moja ii alada! :D
Although a veg joint, this place has an array of snacking items, starting from burgers to pizzas! We ordered :
‚Ä¢ Bombay grilled sandwich - pretty good. There was a generous amount of cheese which made us immensely happy. 
‚Ä¢ Veg burger - appetizing, but a tad bit too spicy. Was served with potata chips.
‚Ä¢ French fries - the usual! The quantity was good. 
‚Ä¢ Tomato cheese pizza - the star of the evening. This was absolutely lip smacking!! It was cheesy and amazingly priced at just 140 bucks. 
All this for 345 bucks, taking into consideration the 100 bucks discount from swiggy! Good quality food at cheap rates. Happy tummies happy us!

A pretty mediocre experience actually. Although the slushies were really good, the sandwich I ordered failed to be filling, let alone tasty. A sandwich of 70 bucks containing only onions, some pieces of boiled potatoes and a little ketchup is not even something I would prefer making at home for myself to be honest. The burger tasted a little better, but still not upto the mark. I believe, for a veg shack to not have a good taste is a suicide in a city of meatlovers really. And that too with no seats, when there are so many better places by the same price with seats and better food too!! Not going back again.

I have been to this place quite a few times.
Had their Bombay veg grilled sandwich, cheese sandwich, Cold coffee and slush. Basically I go there to have my fav slush. The food is nothing gr8... I find them overly priced. The Bombay veg sandwich is the only grilled sandwich available...priced at Rs 80+taxes...2 slices of bread cut into 2 triangles with veggies and mayo....I find the quantity pretty less. I'll rather pay 120 at a cafe which has seating and AC.
I don't understand why so many people frequent this place. The Slush,priced at Rs.40 is served in a small glass,the size gradually reduced over the years....not worth it at all.

It was a late evening, and we were tired after our performance at dhakuria lake and a friend of mine had this place bookmarked and so we planned to drop in. 
A small vegetarian shack like outlet, with a decent variety of food. 
We had slushes, cheese sandwich, Bombay grilled sandwich and cheese garlic burger. 
I have nothing to say about the slushes. 
Cheese sandwich was like normal readymade ones, not appealing at all.
The Bombay grill was okish, it had 4 pieces but overloaded with cucumber (  negative point),and potatos not very flavorful. 
The burger was best of the lot, but the patty was soggy and soft, it was tasty no doubt.
The staff was good. 
The place is not somewhere you should go for ambience and good food, but if you are looking for filling food which will go easy on your pocket you can drop in.

I always used to have their Sweet butter corn and cold coffee.
Try them,you won't be disappointed! There are no seating arrangements though.
You either have to stand or if you are in your car they will serve it for you!:)

It's a pure veg joint and has no seating arrangement it's more like a take away joint. Whenever I walk nearby this place especially  in  hot summer days I make it a point to have their lemon flavoured slush, it is my absolute favourite though nothing extraordinary but quite refreshing. Otherwise all other veg items are quite basic. The prices are also moderate therefore a pocket friendly veg place.

The hangout junction of South Kolkata. All the cars parked beside Vivekananda Park to have a good "adda" and a a glass of slush from Fillers. There's so many other things to drink and have from this place. And their special service to your car is one advantage. They're going to come to you, take your order and serve you there itself. It's a nice place overall.

Nice place to hangout. I stop by this place almost everyday on my way back from office. The only point of concern is they have only veg items. I normally have nachos, paw bhaji, masala corn, club sandwich, burger, etc. Slush is famous here. Since there is no seating arrangement so people just park their cars and have the food inside the car. A cool place to hangout with friends.

Have passed this place quite a couple of times but didn't notice this outlet. A friend of mine suggested this place after reading the reviews on zomato.
We were actually full so just ordered Mexican nacchos. Believe me they provide really insufficient quantity where the price is quite high. A bit of a disappointment on that part.
Otherwise the nacchos and the dip was really good. 
Will visit this place yet again to try out their other items.
P.S - They only serve veg items!

There maybe too many cafes in and around southern avenue now, but fillers has been there from since I remember. 
Good place to have a slush and a sandwich with friends while walking through the area in the evenings.

Fillers is a good eatery for people hanging out at Vivekananda Park. The place is a pocket friendly joint as it is frequented by college goers. Although I don't like veg eateries but I really like their french fries and coffee. Cost for two should be around 200-300 at the max.

A small outlet very close to my place and just in front of Vivekananda park at Jatin bagchi road. It's well known for cool refreshing slush. A completely veg joint serves mainly sandwich nachos and vadas. They don't have seating facility which is the main drawback of the joint inspite of its location.
  Since it's a stone throw distance away from my place i visit this joint very often. I just love the refreshing and different flavours of slush. They also serve masala tea which is highly recommended. Masala or butter corn which is a new addition is also tasty and healthy. Breads of the sandwich are fresh. Sandwiches taste good. 
 It's very famous among students or youngsters who visit vp on a daily basis. People park their cars (no parking charge) and enjoy the fresh air of lake. The cool breeze makes a perfect combination with the food and drinks. Groups of both youngsters and middle aged men come everyday to hang out with friends. The main plus point being the cheap price of the food.
 Slush and masala tea are recommended if anyone comes to this area.

Quick bites and beverages! Nachos is good here, haven't tried too many things here though. Pizzas / cola float combo are quick fillings. Prices are steap for the standard. 

Good place to hang out and chill with kids. The only and good part is the car service.

But just good as it sounds, remember the car park is illegal and cops are always around. You will buy yourself a ticket sooner than later. Happened with me and thus I drove away after paying the fine with my nachos without paying them for it. Morally they should have let me know that they serve in the car on a no parking zone.

For food, we took mixed cheese pizza, mushroom pizza, veg burger,french fries, ice tea, cold coffee and cold drinks
The cheese pizzas were hot and yummy... French fries tasted good... Not the packaged ones but fresh so they were crispy... The iced tea was also not packaged but made by them...so it was refreshingly good...
Overall, value for money since the bill came to 700 for 4 people

The Flavored Slush is the most refreshing thing ever! Smooth crushed ice with the flavor of your choice. Avoid the orange, as it taste like Rasna. However, the Lime and Pineapple are fab! The cold coffee with ice cream is another favorite. 
Another value for more, low fat snack would be the vegetable sandwich. Simple, freshly made, with lots of pepper. 
The only bad thing is, it's a little over priced for the quality and quantity.

I assume fillers has been around since the time I have been around or maybe more than me. 
While growing up on my way to ILSS for a morning swim I used to look at fillers with awe! Located in Southern Avenue this place is quite a popular hangout spot for teenagers and young couples. Filled with parked cars, this place serves some really nice & crispy fries, pizzas and drinks. 
It has been ages since I entered Fillers, it has no seating area and mostly people are just hanging out either inside their respective  cars or sitting in front of some house steps.
Last month, I was with my sister and we took our pet dog out for a walk, and suddenly I was craving for a cold drink and luckily we were just crossing fillers. 
But once I was inside I ended up ordering more than a cold drink I ordered cold coffee - nice and creamy, a cheese pizza, fries and a Bombay grill sandwich
Can't say much about the Bombay grill sandwich because it was strictly okay, but my cheese pizza surely had some serious cheese! It was quite cheesy and thankfully like the rest of the other cheap joints the tomato pur√©e flavour wasn't overpowering! The French fries were crisp and nice to munch on. 
I wouldn't want to change anything about this place, it has remained this way for the past 25-26 years! I just don't fit into the crowd of teens anymore!

More than the food, one enjoys the company they are with and the weather(if it is favourable :p) Food is average and the prices are fairly cheap.

Around that time this was maybe the only fast food joint in the area. U can't miss it as u will see 10-12 cars parked near the shops with teenagers and college dudes hangout in front of the shop.

Fillers has been an integral part of me growing up.... it was THE to go ¬†joint my cricket coaching at vp grounds,or after school ....to chill out sessions...Fillers connects with a varied age group...and all of us patent fillers loyalists have bigtime fond memories associated with this place.

If you haven't had fillers slush (I love the orange & mango) or their corn...then you can't call yourself a fillers loyalist... The best thing about this place is they waiters remember ¬†you by your face once you're a regular and they exactly know what you want to order.

If you want to just drive in and park your car ,grab a bite with your friends, then you'll be served your order in the car only.¬†

I would recommend submarine sandwich, cheese & garlic burger, french fries & cold coffee with ice cream.

Service is real fast unless and until you have too many orders in cue, staff is very friendly and attentive, quality and quantity wise is good too & extremely easy on the pocket to be affordable for everyone.

Located near Vivekananda Park, Fillers is a prime spot of hangout for the youth of this city. To grab a quick bite after a game of football, or to catch up with old friends, Fillers is the place for it all. It's a vegetarian joint, they make good nachos, baby corn pizza and masala corn. I come here mainly for the slush which is amazing during summer. The corn is good too. They could improve on the sandwiches. And also start serving non veg.

Location: Opposite Vivekananda Park, Jatin Bagchi Road, Southern Avenue. 

This place has been here for years and has maintained its quality of fooding until now. It has been quite¬†famous¬†among the young aged people. 
This purely vegetarian place is more like a drive-in eatery as it lacks seating arrangements. One can drive¬†up to¬†this place and dine in the car parked at a side or stand at the eatery and eat. 

Being near to my place, have visited it a number of times and tried a lot of things plus had always¬†opted¬†this place when was low on cash in my earlier days, so, here we have the recommendation list: 

- Burger (Baked Beans/Vegetable/Cheese Garlic).
- Sandwich (American Club/Cheese/Bombay Grill).
- Pao Bhaji.
- French Fries.
- Mexican Tacos.
- Pizza (Baked Beans/Chilli/Onion & Cheese/Garlic & Cheese).
- Slush.
- Cold Coffee with Icecream.
- Cinnamon Coffee.

The staff is efficient and happy to help you and the service is prompt.
Earlier the costs were a pocket-friendly affair, but, now are nearly at par with other snack stops. 

Has always been a good experience. But, with time the quality has degraded.
-Nostalgic. :)

I came by this place on my first date. :)
Placed right beside Vivekananda Park and just across the road from The Lake area, its a cool joint to hang out with friends. But no place to sit so you might have to stand and have your food. Mostly for people driving in. You can order by sitting in your car and the food would be delivered to you. I ordered a Mexican sandwich and Garlic Cheese pizza with a hot Chocolate. The taste was pretty good, specially the Hot Chocolate. The food was served promptly.¬†
I would love to drop by again if I visit the locality.

Located near Vivekananda Park, Fillers is a common adda for school, college goers but thinking about the food alone, its not that good anymore, in my opinion.

No doubt i have frequented this place in my past, mainly for its pizza, but have lost the taste for it now, moreso since they dont make it that good nowadays. They have a decent pure veg menu offering all kinds of sandwiches, burgers, pizza, coffee etc . The prices are reasonable. They serve you in the car which is their best part. However staff service, hospitality varies from person to person.

Coming to food, their pizza and burgers are very traditional indian style ones. Pizzas are very ok but i like their burgers. They are big and tasty. Cheese toast is pretty good. Cold coffee is good, just good but eventually teams up well with the other items i order. 

Overall its a good place to grab some quick snacks while sitting in your car or standing outside but otherwise, i would rather avoid it !!!

They say Dine in is available, what they don't mention is this much visited snacks bar opposite Vivekananda Park does not have the proper accommodations for a sit-in. Its going strong because of their pocket friendly burgers, pav bhaji, french fries and slushes. :) Love their vegetable burger and chips, french fries, mexican tacos, paw bhaji, and slush of your choice :D.. a must visit after a long evenings adda with friends, or drunk moments at VP (most of you have had that :P)

Location: Opposite Vivekananda Park, Jatin Bagchi Road, Southern Avenue. 

This place has been here for years and has maintained its quality of fooding until now. It has been quite¬†famous¬†among the young aged people. 
This purely vegetarian place is more like a drive-in eatery as it lacks seating arrangements. One can drive¬†up to¬†this place and dine in the car parked at a side or stand at the eatery and eat. 

Being near to my place, have visited it a number of times and tried a lot of things plus had always¬†opted¬†this place when was low on cash in my earlier days, so, here we have the recommendation list: 

- Burger (Baked Beans/Vegetable/Cheese Garlic).
- Sandwich (American Club/Cheese/Bombay Grill).
- Pao Bhaji.
- French Fries.
- Mexican Tacos.
- Pizza (Baked Beans/Chilli/Onion & Cheese/Garlic & Cheese).
- Slush.
- Cold Coffee with Icecream.
- Cinnamon Coffee.

The staff is efficient and happy to help you and the service is prompt.
Earlier the costs were a pocket-friendly affair, but, now are nearly at par with other snack stops. 

Has always been a good experience. But, with time the quality has degraded.
-Nostalgic. :)

Smoothies are decent and I like the corn in a rainy day. 
Full of nostalgia and good service/ decent food = happy me ! 
So yes , this place is a win win for me :D

I wish there were better accommodations for the customers, nevertheless this cafe has been going strong for ages now. The reasons being their cheap fast food and flavoured slushes and smoothies.  As soon as you park your  car, someone runs to you, their service is that much efficient. Their slushes are a must for me, I mean literally there has not been a single time in history when I visited this place and didn't order a flavoured slush.. Recently I have taken a fascination on their french fries. However small the cafe may seem, they offer you 3 different bottles of sauce to choose from and are considerate enough to provide you with tissue papers readily. It is the perfect place to catch up on some quick bites while you are out for a walk at the Rabindra Sarovar lake.

Fillers is a mutual Adda place for my friends! We drop by... Park our cars and chill! The slushes are nice...! We call for nachos always... This is by far one of the oldest place serving nachos in the city!  Coming to the pizza what we get here is the total indian version of fat bread masala pizza :p and it times they please my taste buds to a certain extent! Fast service :)

Right next to my house and i am surprised how come i have not yet reviewed this place... this was THE place to go during our school and college days when there were not too many places to hang out in kolkata...

now a days it is not the same and with the price escalations and other components such as crowd in the area this place is not what it used to be... to add the quality of the place has also gone down...

the things to try for sure will be the SLUSH, cola float, cheese garlic burgers and the homemade style pizzas... 

dont try the nachos as they will be wasted as they are just not good... 

in other things to try the bombay grill sandwich is pretty good as in the french fries...

this place is a fast eat and leave concept and if the summer time heat is on it is not even that as the temperatures soar standing in this place if you have not got your car... 

all in all a grab and run joint if you not in the mood for adda at a fair price with average to above average quality of food...

Nice open place and outdoor seating. Slushers was good :) :) Its a kind of crushed ice with flavoured syrup. Only 20 bucks and much better than cold drinks :D . Trust me. Burgers are not that good.Its average to taste. But  Mexican Tacos were good to taste and Mexican Sandwich was also good. Chilled Smoothies are good and nice place to hangout :D :D

Its a nice little place, totally for take-away.
It serves only vegetarian food, so that's a down side
The slush here is very cheap, 20 bucks only! The food is normal, yes it offers pizza, burgers but don't expect lip smacking taste. It won't let you down though ! Value for money I say. Good place to have a quick bite if you bring your own car. 
Its a treat for you, if you're on low budget !

They have a wide menu to eat , ( everything on menu is available ) food is very good and up to the mark. Very good service. Huge staff !! Even the cold coffee and shakes are good there ! When you leave this place , you'll be happy I'm sure !

There was a time when fillers pizzas were a rave.Pizza meant only fillers and corner cafe.Well that time was in the late 90s .Fillers was an all time favourite joint for many college goers and it still is.The mixed cheese pizza, bombay grill sandwich,floats are amazing.However the recent prices dont make them feasible,considering we can get authentic pizzas at the same rate!Also the owner, is never welcoming,no smiles nothing :/ 
I recently tried the nachos there and was very disappointed.
Notheless there is a bit of nostalgia attached to the mixed cheese pizza which makes me rate fillers a 3.5

Fillers is a blessing for the people who frequently hang out at Vivekananda Park. It is perhaps the oldest out of all the food joints in and around the vicinity. Fillers is basically a vegetarian snack joint where you can get your food delivered to your car or stand and eat. There is no place to sit and chill. Though I am not a very big fan of vegetarian stuff, but I keep coming back for the veg sandwiches, french fries the cheese toast and the hot coffee. The coffee priced at Rs20 is definitely VFM. 
They also have a hot corn counter and the large cup of corn is priced at Rs40 which I find pretty reasonable. 
Since there are not much options other than munching on the Phuchkas, chats, etc, I prefer going to Fillers for a quick snack. 

The interiors are very basic and nothing much to talk about. There are few Classic rock band posters on the wall which they have put up a year back may be. If you are around Vivekananda Park and wanna sit and bite something, you may check out Fillers. Cost for two should be around Rs200-Rs300

Highly recommended for fast food with fresh air and an area of peace and silence,,,,there is a small playground opposite to Fillers which ensures a cool and fresh breeze...the place has ample area of parking and generally ppl tend to order food inside their cars only..

The best things to eat here are the veg cheese burger, the mix veg pizza, French fries. Amongst things to drink here, there is hot coffee served by them in an old fashioned glass 3/4 filled,,,,,,really nice hot coffee,,,,,,,you would also like the fresh lime soda and the slush out here,,,,,perfect hangout place for an evening,,,,,,you fill find lots of teenagers and college going ppl out there doing their ADDA sessions...

All in all, a good place, if you are looking for fast food,,,to be served in your car amidst a peaceful environment...

This place used to be frequented by school and college students in search of good, cheap food, which was found here. However, these days, the quality of the food available has suffered. 

The Pizzas and the Slushes are shadows of their former selves. The former have become smaller and the ingredients used are no longer that good, while the latter now has too much ice for one's liking. The price increases have not brought with it the expected improvement/stability in the quality.

There is no service as such - one orders and collects one's order. The old practice of eating in one's car has persisted. The service has really not changed as such, possibly because this place has never needed it. A good place to drop in for a snack, but if better options are available nearby, then those should be frequented.

First thing - Fillers is the place when you are around Bibekananda park, sitting on the grass, and you suddenly feel like french fries and coke. Run over and order from their vegetarian menu, and you would be pleasantly surprised by their Cheese toast.

I want to like Fillers. But its all about serving up food which are probably reheated or quickly fried. 

Although I find the rest of the stuff they serve here pretty much boring, these are the two things I go to Fillers for and I would continue going. There is no seating arrangement as such, as most of the crowd are guys in cars sitting with music blasting and waiters coming over to the cars to take orders.

I don't have a count of the no of times I have been to fillers at southern avenue or better known at VP (Vivekanada Park). don't expect much from this place but it does serve its purpose well. Frequented most by teenagers and the younger crowd the place is a small little cafe that serves everything from coffee to corn. 

A typical evening crowd at Fillers is no less than ten cars parked in all direction around this cafe an the waiters running the orders, by serving in the car they give you the drive-in feel.

Here is my pick for a sumptuous fillers evening snack:
1. Cold coffee with icecream - an indian cold coffee that is overtly sweet and thick :)
2. Submarine Sandwich: Served on a 6 inch submarine shaped bread this is a sandwich that packs in veggies with a load of cheese and is garnished with tomato and mustard sauce.
3. Veg Pizza - a typical Indian version of pizza, loaded with veggies and topped with shredded cheese, do remember this is not even mozzarella. the base ofcoruse is the typical off the shelf pizza base that you get.

I went back after 6 years when I was at Calcutta this time, the waiter still managed to recognize me and as usual served with a smile. 

The good part of fillers is the car service - you can be seated in the comfort of your car - they don't have any seating so this works best.

I would love to take my son the next time I am at Calcutta :).

Fillers is an old haunt for a quick snack if your around Vivekanand Park. Many a time you simply feel like a drive and a snack but not someplace fancy in cases like that Fillers is a good option. My recommendations .... Chilli Cheese Toast , Cheese and Garlic Burger , French Fries and the Baked Beans Pizza with extra cheese ..... the pizza is home-style so don't expect the fancy Pizza Hut or Domino's variety ! The cola float or the slush make for the perfect beverage in summer and on a rainy or wintery day my beverage of choice is the  lemon tea or the hot chocolate.

I have memories associated with Fillers as I had my tuitions there... As a veggie, I absolutely relished its veg burgers and hot dogs, apart from the HUGE cheese pizza. The rates are really, really excellent and the food leaves a typical desi late 1990s fast food taste in your mouth and takes you back to the lanes of nostalgia!!

On the whole, if you're in Southern Avenue and want to grab a bite, I would DEFINITELY recommend you to try Fillers, simply for its burgers, hot dogs, pizzas and the shakes!

Fillers - Really fills the stomach!
3 out of 5

A popular joint among teenagers, Fillers is located on Jatin Bagchi Lane in Southern Avenue, near Vivekananda Park. This place always remains crowded, especially in the afternoon and mainly includes young couples from Rabindra Sarobar, the lakes and young cricketers or footballers from Vivekananda park (or other sports club there). A little food joint with (mainly) takeaway service, it also has very basic dine-in service available on the footpath, so it is better not to sit-n-dine here.

When I used to eat here a long time back, I loved the Submarine sandwiches and hot dogs because of their super yummy taste. Recently, I was in that area for some office work and felt like visiting this place after many years. As I walked in, I felt the same atmosphere I used to feel years back - it was nostalgic. No change in ambience - it was absolutely the same, with a few minor additions in the menu which were good. 

This time, I stepped out of my shell and instead of ordering a hot dog or sandwich I opted for some paw bhaji along with nimbu pani-soda. Both were good. The paw bhaji was made very nicely, maintaining a perfect balance in its ingredients to bring out a lovely taste without being too spicy. The place maintains decent standards and prices are absolutely pocket-friendly. Their service was quick as always.

Location : Fillers is located near vivekananda park.  It's basically a fast food Center where you get shakes, pizzas, burgers, hot dogs and French fries. It's a spot for the teens in Calcutta who love to sip coffee and smoke. 

Coming to the pros and cons
Pros
1) prices are cheap
2) food quantity is okay
3) located at a good area attracts customers
4) though small but earns quite a lot

Cons: 
1) service isn't great staffs are like with a very ok attitude 
2) service is slow during peak hours
3) food quality isn't great it's very ok 

One must try : hot dogs, burgers and pizzas all are okay. Pizza is better than the two.
Coffee is okay

quite the crowd favourite, this old hangout place primarily for teens . we have all probably been to Fillers either during cricket matches in vivekananda park or while roaming around the dhakuria lake . But I was quite happily surprised to see the speed of client servicing lately.
As I mentioned earlier it is a hangout place for teenagers-  hence available items are like sodas, ice creams, burgers and slushes . Although they sugest veg items as their speciality I believe they currently added non veg items too.
If you go there have the american corn and slushes-  affordable and nice.

Visited this place for the first time today. Had coffee and pineapple slush which were pretty good given the taste, quantity and price (price of slush is now Rs. 20). Want to try out something to eat, the next time i visit this place. The location is good and it offers more than 6 flavors of slush (what else do you need on a hot and sultry summer day?). One big drawback is that the place offers no place to sit down and grab a quick bite. So be prepared to stand and enjoy your drink/food.

Nice place to hang-out and have a cold drink or a Vada pav... that's it... Do not try to eat anything else... Had the misfortune of ordering a Pizza during my last visit. The cheese (mind you - Amul cheese) was simply grated over the top. Somebody needs to tell them that Pizza has a different cheese and it needs to be put in the oven before service.
Pathetic.

Have been visiting this place for sometime now. Its in southern avenue near french loaf. Gotta tell you that this place is good although there isnt any seating arrangement.

I always have the hot dog here. Its super tasty. The french fries are also very good. Didn't like the sandwiches much. They serve slush as well here. There is also a corn stall inside as well. 

Overall a satisfying snack hangout with very reasonable pricing. I am a regular here. 

4 stars from me for Fillers.
