Located near kesab chandra sen street and amherst street crossing, this traditional resturant had served foodies all over kolkata for quite a good time. Although not themed or well decorated but one can easily find a cozy place out here to have great tasty foods. The 'must try's are Egg Devil, Paratha with chicken kosha, Fried rice.
