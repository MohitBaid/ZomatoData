I have been coming here since I was a kid. I love the chicken bharta they prepare. The staffs n the owner is very well behaved n mannered. The food is great compared to the price. Very pocket friendly. Ambiance is not that great.. I generally order take out.

The food here is truly very tasty. I usually order lunch. The prices r not very high. Good quantity n great taste is surely a best bet. My usual order is chicken bharta & mutton korma with butter naan.

North Kolkata has many good places where you can find North Indian food and this place is a quintessential example of it. As suggested in Zomato  I went for the butter chicken and Tandoori Roti. While my friends went for the Mutton Korma and Mutton Curry along with roti and rice. 

Butter Chicken: Being a fan of North Indian quisine, I knew this was a special dish and mostly available throughout Punjab as a speciality. I thus ordered this and I was never more satisfied. The aroma was of butter and as i tasted it I realized that it was the most perfect rendition of my favorite Punjabi dish. Along with the right balance of spices and soft tender chicken, it was heaven served on my plate. 

I may have gone overboard my review but it was really worth it. I did not have Mutton Korma or Mutton Curry but will try it out as soon as possible and give a review for that as well.

The place doesn't have any ambiance but their food is really good. Their Butter naan was enough soft. Chicken dishes were really good. We ordered for Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Chicken Korma. Both were tasty came in good quantity.
Prices are much high :( if you compare by the standard of the place.

The place looks very dingy but the food was mind blowing. After having such rich food for four days seeing rice, daal and chicken made my day. The food was delicious. Perfectly balanced and cooked to perfection.

সপ্তমীর দুপুরে উত্তর কলকাতায় অনেকটা ঘোরাঘুরির পর ছাতুবাবু-লাটুবাবুর বাড়ির বিখ্যাত পুজো দেখতে যাওয়ার পথে পাঞ্জাব হিন্দু হোটেলের উপর চোখ পড়লো।
পেটে খিদে,সময় দুপুর,তায় রোদ উঠেছে বৃষ্টির পর। ঢুকে পড়লাম চোখ কান বুজে। লম্বা টেবিল পাতা,ব্যস্ত পরিবেশকরা মুর্মুহুঃ গরম নান,মাংসের চাঁপ নিয়ে দৌড়াদৌড়ি করে টেবিলে টেবিলে পৌঁছে দিচ্ছে।
বেশিক্ষন বসতে হলো না।আমরা জনা পাঁচেক মিলে বাটার নান আর চিকেন কষা অর্ডার দিয়ে দিলাম। রেস্তোরার ভেতরে আশপাশে দেখি বেশ অনেক কেবিন রয়েছে,একদা নর্থ ক্যালকাটার প্রেমজীবনের অন্যতম অংশ ছিল এই কেবিনসমূহ। এখন Kfc আর pizza hut এর চক্করে... হায় কেবিন!!তোমার দিন গিয়েছে।
মিনিট পাঁচেকের ভিতর নান আর মাংস এসে পড়লো।
কিন্তু হা হতোস্মি!!! এ কেমন কষা??
ট্যালট্যালে ঝোলে এক পিস চিকেন নির্লজ্জ ভাবে ভাসমান।
খিদের চোটে তাই চেটেপুটে সাঁটালাম,কিন্তু পরিতৃপ্তি হলো না।
চিকেন সিদ্ধ যদি ঝোলে ফেলে দেওয়া হয়, তবেই বোধহয় এমন ডিশ তৈরি হয়। ভেবেছিলাম শেষে একটা পানীয় নেওয়া যাবে।কিন্তু আশাভঙ্গের দায় নিতে পারলাম না আর।

One of my favourite places for kebabs and north Indian food. The tandoori chicken here is awesome. So are the chicken tikka and reshmi kebabs. Soft, juicy, flavourful and reasonably priced. 

The dining hall is big and they keep it very clean. The owner is very friendly too. Service is fast.

Apart from the kebabs their paneer items are also good. Quality of paneer used is very good. 

Naans here are soft and tasty.

Chicken and mutton dishes are also well made with soft and juicy meat pieces.

Don't forget to order a kulhar of lassi along with your meal and am sure you will leave the place with a happy stomach.

Cheap price, great food. Their specialities are Saagh meat, dahi chicken, chana masala, egg tarka, kulcha etc. The food is prepared using their own family recipes and are very tasty. Must try for every punjabi food lovers and yes, just forget ur diet regime when u are visiting coz they are very liberal about the ghee and butter in the food.

This is a gr8 place if you are not watching your weight - extremely extravagant with oil in their dishes. But there is no doubt about the taste of their dishes - specially vegetarian. 4+ for their vegetarian dishes but non-veg dishes here are very good, barring sometimes when they are raw and not properly cooked. So try your luck with the non-veg and give in to the oily but tasty veg dishes.
