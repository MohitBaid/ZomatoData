Though the prices are at par with that of Wow momo's but the taste hasn't peaked up yet. 
Hope they add more dishes to their menu. Rating it 4 because the staff is kind :)

I am a momo lover...tried momos from Steamos for once. A plate of chicken momo costs 70here.. The momo size was good,full with chicken,served with soup and chutney. Taste was average...not too good to mention. :)

Been there last weekend, discovered this food joint at WoodSquare Mall while was feeling very hungry and was in hurry as well. Steamos offered great momos at affordable price, hygenic and tasty. Staff was very courteous. Great place for MOMO lovers...folks..go get it. I hope they add Cold Drinks in their menu..

if you are hungry grab  a plate from here but if you are a momo fan stay away! the momos do not match upto the price label and is not good at all.....chicken lolipops also taste average...  the food is costly considering the below standard taste.... could have been very much better....

The worst momo that you will ever find in this town is at this place my friend. The serving of food is just pathetic...the soup that they serve is in a cup of glass....the momos are not of that great quality.

No words to describe this outlet of Stemos. By far the worst I have eaten.... 
A suggestion...  whoever is the owner of this please look into the quality of the items being sold.

Kolkata is known for its street food, and you get all kinds of food from Chinese to Chop. Most of the places you eat they are good no matter how small shop is or how unhygienic the thela looks. Steamos is a disgrace to street food. I never eaten a worse momo than this. The soup smells of raw children. The store charges Rs.70 for 5 momos its too expensive for nothing. Going to this shop is a big dare.

A friend of mine has bought a flat in Narendrapur and we were there moving her stuff. By noon we were hungry and absolutely needed something to eat but too tired to get out. Zomato came to rescue and we found Steamos. We ordered Chicken momo as that was the only thing they have. But their service was quite prompt and the momos were tasty and full of chicken. At Rs. 70 a plate it was great value for money. I hope they put other things on their menu.

Really liked the MoMos served with hot soup and red and green chutneys. value for money priced at 70 in a great ambiance.  With Steamos search for variety and quality momos has finally ended for people like me in nearby complexes of Sherwood and Sugam Park etc...
