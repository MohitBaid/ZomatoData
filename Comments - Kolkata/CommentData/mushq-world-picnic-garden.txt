Are you the same bakery who stole Poonam Maria Prem's creation and claimed that to be your own ? I heard You regularly post cakes baked by others as your own creation and have been banned in the Home Bakers Guild forum ? Why do you do this ? This is plagiarism!!! And cheating innocent people..!

Initially, I was not quite sure about this place since I don't like to try unknown places when it comes to bakery. However, I was intrigued by the ratings and reviews on Zomato so I thought to try it this time and I ordered a themed cake for my mother's birthday. They helped me in choosing the design and when I got the cake, it was perfect. The taste was amazing, and the look was classy. Fondant was good too. However, the place is too shady, and it is inside a small lane. Home delivery is the preferable option. Overall, had a great experience. Thanks again for the lovely cake !

They are the best home bakers in town. And I am not being at all biased as the baker is my dear friend. They design the cake and bake it to perfection. Soft yummy and chocolaty cakes baked with perfection. All the work and design on cakes are made with precision. All in all I love their cakes. And most imp they bake Eggless cake !! Won't definitely make a hole in your pocket ,

I have known this girl by chance through face book.. First time i ordered cake with her which was quite beautiful and cheap as compared to what I generally order in krazy for chocolate or kookie jar. The cake tasted heaven n kushi was so friendly and approachable that it's been almost more then a year that I order all my cakes from her, I ask her for many designs and variety , and trust me she and her sister had executed it to the level of perfection. Cost wise also I would say they are quite cheap as compared to market. In Rakhi this time I ordered snacks like pizza, pasta, lasagne etc, they were scrumptious. She bakes  all breads herself so the freshness of the food can be understood at one go. Mushq is superb. I am attaching few picture of the cake she made for me.

Mushq World is the best place to learn different cusine and order food for various occasions. I have done various classes across Kolkata and find them the best.Richa di and Khushi di are the best mentor.
Their kitchen is extremely clean and all the dishes are taught from scratch with hands on session provided.
Food ordered through Mushq are all fresh and have the warmth of home made food.They also cater to taste by providing best quality ingredients.
This place is highly recommended to all.

It was a sudden plan to celebrate a relative's baby shower next morning at 9am. It was 8pm and I lost hope of having a cake for the celebration. Then my sister suggested this home baker. To be very frank I was not optimistic of getting the cake done on such a short notice. But as we called them, they agreed to make the cake. They WhatsApp us the designs of the theme cake. There were hell lot of varieties in it. We chose the cake to our likings.
I was surprised to get the cake delivered at 7.30am. I was really impressed to get a 3 Lb theme cake in such a notice. Coming to the cake, it looked amazing. The cake was soft and yummy. Everyone liked it.
Highly recommended.
