It was my 3rd time on Peshawri- ITC Sonar, the experience and food was just fabulous and spellbound..they provide a wide range of North Indian dishes. The dishes which i have specially tried are truly awesome...The main disappointment was that there tables are not spacious..The table which is meant forr 6 person , i think it will be comfortable for 4...so Peshawri should work on this matter...otherwise it was a nice dining experience...

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was greatly disappointed. Long story short- this is an overhyped, overpriced, photogenic restaurant good for photos to fill your Facebook newsfeed, but the food is nothing to write home about.¬†

The seats are extremely uncomfortable - high-end stools with no backrests. I noticed many people at my table and other tables shifting themselves during the course of the dinner.¬†

The menu is EXTREMELY limited. While the kebab and lamb were decent, they weren't worth the price. The naan arrived cold. The chicken was dry and overseasoned. Rice is not even on the menu. Some of our drinks arrived after our main dishes. And worst of all, they expect you to eat with your hands and fingers. I can understand embracing the Peshawri eating experience, but the restaurant waiters should be more accommodating if some people at the table request silverware.¬†

If the quality of food is a priority for you, I strongly recommend going elsewhere. This place is not worth the price.

A grand and luxurious property of the ITC groups easily accessible.
The peshawar provides a wide range of north indian nd bengali cuisine both buffet and A la Carte. It has a huge buffet layout with a mixture of indian cuisines.
The ambience is awesome and interior decor suits the theme.
Its a lovely place to have a lavish feast.

Went couple of times for the buffet dinner. Loved the ambience, decor, hospitality and of course the food. I really liked the idea of having the food with bare hands. Very comforting and convenient given the kind of food that is served. The star of the show is indeed the giant lobster. Only a giant can finish a whole lobster. Special mention is the kali daal. One star is subtracted for the red wine that is served. That is definitely not 5 star standard. I keep wondering about one thing though. How on earth did they get lobsters in peshawar ? Nevermind. Dont we enjoy bollywood movies for that matter !!

Visited this place for the first time on the occasion of brothers day. Simply this goes without saying a lavish 5 star experience in terms of food, hospitality, warm service.

We ordered pudina paratha (very flaky and tasty), kebab platter with 2 types of mouth watering chicken and 2 types of mutton kebabs - spices are marinated to the best perfection to suit the palette and yes of course their signature daal bukhara - lentils slowly cooked overnight, which is creamy just out of the world. On the dessert platter we ordered phirni and kulfi with faluda which tasted very yummy.
Last but not the least loved their whisky based cocktail newly launched 'sultan', blend of honey, lemon, cardamom. Hats off to the bar tender for such creations.

Coming to decor part, the restaurant resembles the theme of jail with low seaters with also private dinning area facility. Very similar to their signature restaurant 'Daal Bukhara' - the legendary eatery of Delhi ITC Maurya.

Peshwari was one of a grand experience..the staffs politely escorted us to our seat from where we had a clear view of their cooking counter..where the chefs was in action behind the large glass...I had the best starter of my life there at peshwari-- PESHAWARI KABAB....the taste and aroma can't be expressed in words...in the main course one must try their speciality--DAAL BUKHARA....the restaurant request the guest of the traditional style of having food by fingers not by spoon ...however it's not mandatory for the guest..it was one of a kind of experience there...kulfi was simply amazing...they offer a tray full of paan at the exit....each and every little things were so much perfect there...afterall it's ITC Sonar-- the name says it all..

Peshawri is a brand of resturaunts operated by ITC across it‚Äôs luxury hotel chain and is famous for it‚Äôs exquisite and unique flavours of the North Indian cuisine. If you know this brand, my review will not affect your perception of this place. To begin with, we ordered some kebabs which included Paneer Tikka tandoori among other things! Our main course was the unique Dal Bukhara, Paneer Khurchan with assorted Indian breads. Dal Bukhara is their famous dish which will relish your tongue. 
If you‚Äôre thinking to go, don‚Äôt think any further and just enjoy their luxurious hospitality coupled with the intriguing North Indian delights. 

Overall - I‚Äôll keep visiting.

Was here with friends for a quick dinner fell in love with the decor and presentation! You get separate aprons for vegetarians and non vegetarians and no spoons, enjoy the delicacies here with ur hands and enjoy with all ur senses! The ultimate winner was of course the daal Bukhara! Loved the tiny gift and the surprise cake that they arranged for our friend who had her birthday! Special thanks to mr Anurag the restaurant manager there..... still waiting for his special performance but nevertheless he was extremely hospitable and charming!

Peshawri was one grand experience. We went when the celebrations were on for ITC's 15th year anniversary. As a part of welcoming the guests, there was an instant photo booth and also vintage liquor on display for sale.
We were politely escorted to our seats which gave us a clear view of the cooking counter where the chefs were in action behind the glass; their dexterity was amazing. While we nibbled on complimentary spicy papads and salad, we ordered Murgh Malai Kebab which was a delight to start with. A Scotch cocktail named Sultan was ordered, it had been introduced that day itself and I was told it was super smooth on the palate.
Finally, the main course - surprisingly, we opted for a vegetarian dish - Dal Bukhara which is one of the specialties of the restaurant. Needless to say, it was extremely delicious to have with Tandoori Naan.
All the while, the service was exemplary and hygiene top-notch. Also, we were insisted to eat with our bare hands, because at Peshawri it is believed that their food is to be felt with all the 5 senses, through the 5 fingers - which seemed quite thoughtful. For dessert, we had Phirnee which looked and tasted very different and much better than anywhere I've had.
The interiors is a blend of Indian royalty and earthiliness and very sophisticated. Obviously, the price is on the higher side but worth the experience. For North Indian cuisine, Peshawri is the ultimate place to go.

Truly a 5* experience :) 

Be its interior decor, ambience, super courteous staff, prompt service or its delectable spread, Peshawari nails every aspect of your dine out experience and makes it an extremely memorable one.

The signature dish, Dal Bukhara, is worth every penny of its hype and so is the Paneer Tikka for starters. The quantity was also more than enough for our requirement. Paan offered at the end of the dinner was perfect way to round up the experience.

Thumbs up to their practice of encouraging everybody to eat out of their hand, helped by lack of any spoon/fork on the table.

Looking forward to revisit them soon.

ITC has never let me down whenever it comes to hospitality, this time too they've maintained the legacy, I've made a reservation before a month for the Durga saptami family lunch, so as the day proceeded we went for our lunch though it was a rainy afternoon.

So this partcular restaurant is located in the downstairs, and the decor and music according to me more had a laid back awadhi feeling, quite interestingly one can see the chefs preparing for the succulent kebabs etc as the kitchen is visible as it's made up of glass, the server was polite and told us about the special cocktails they had for the occassion, so we ordered accordingly!

Service=4/5
Presentation = 4/5 
Quality = 5/5 
Quantity = 5/5
 
 Two of us took only one parantha Nd one naan which was more than enough for us along with a kebab and side dish as well as dal bukhara which we couldn't finish,and not to forget everything was made just perfectly, spiced and cooked well.

The best thing was the kesari kulfi, the thickened kesari milk into kulfi with pista and moist falooda was a perfect ending and also a wish to visit again soon!!! 
And they didn't just stop here after leaving the table while going out there's a table where they have kept juicy paan (betel leaves )!!! So the entire experience alike always has been really good!!!

Truly a 5* experience.
The enigmatic staff and their lovely indian attire made a great statement. The exclusive decor and the ornate carpets and antique pieces on the walls made it more interesting than ever. The staff did a wonderful job keeping us enjoying our time at Peshawri. Coming to the food, dal Bukhara and murgh khurchan, as suggested by fellow Zomatoers, turned out to be exquisite and truly lip smacking. The drinks, mocktails and cocktails were superb too. I'd put up my coat on the hangar just to relax throughout the evening. The muddha or small seats were good looking to the you but a little uncomfortable in the long run. 
The paan in the end was also a touch of good taste. The other food items that we tried were fish tikka, paneer tikka, murgh malai tikka and tandoori aloo for the starters. For the main course we had garlic naan, mixed veg, murgh khurchan, dal Bukhara (it's out of the world). It was truly a pleasure having a dinner here. Most importantly, they didn't had cutlery on the tables and asked us to have food with your bare hands. Came as a shock to some of us though üòã, but they give to whosoever needs it. Great night, thanks to Peshawri, ITC.

I so wanted to take pictures of the dishes. When you come to eat at such an exquisite place, that is the last one is expected to do. However, I just couldn't stop eating!!
If you have üí∞ to spare (a whole lot I ought to say), and have an impeccable taste for Kebabs, then this is the place for you. The lachha parantha and the daal was amazing. We ordered 3 Kebabs. The chicken and the fish were outstanding. However, the highlight was the lobster. If you ever had a craving for lobster, then you got to have it from Peshawari at least once in your life. I wish I could describe it in words, but I am salivating too damn much! Even the kulfi was great. The pocket pinch for two was a little above 12k. So save up!!

Well it was a sudden plan ... My partner Nd i were thinking of where to go as we had no work we listed a few restaurants but either I or she rejected it... But when someone says thn " ITC t peshwari jawa jak"  it can't be rejected ... The crave for good food and a good ambience pulled us to peshwari... We ordered onion kulcha , butter naan , Dal Bukhara , and murgh khurchan and yes the best ever kulfi of my life was served in peshwari. Now let's come one by one on the food. Dal Bukhara was the best thing which  happened to me in peshwari... It is a dish prepared overnight for 24hrs and was something for which i would go there... Murgh khurchan a perfectly made chicken a dry preparation goes well with roti it was something new which i had and yes it was good...Now the kulcha and naan it was good when served but as we took time to hv the food it became hard ... Next the kulfi a must try we took one and they did it one by two i.e. a kulfi sliced into two halves... But yes something which i was disappointed was the kinley mineral water which was served as we asked for mineral water was tooo costly 20rs thing coated 150... Sad on that part... If it would hv been Himalaya or something better then won't HV ever complained... And yes the AC was too strong those are made to feel comfortable in there not to bring you feel of hills in ITC... All in all a good experience will visit here again but this time only regular water ;-)

Me and my partner visited the place sometime back. ITC Sonar Bangla, the name says it all. Being one of the best five star in Kolkata I get excited whenever I visit the place.
We went to celebrate my partner's post birthday in Peshwari with a pre-booked table. We were greeted by in a warm way. Since our car had some issues we went in uber and later our driver was suppose to come with the car. When we told them about the issue they arranged for a man waiting for our car to be parked. This was a really great gesture. 
We went inside and made ourselves comfortable. The ambience gave me a feel of the medieval age and I was impressed to see the menu in a wooden plate. We ordered for some Burrah Kebab. Before that we were served complimentary papad, masala onions and pickle. The lamb was soft and was grilled. The texture of food justified the name Peshwari. We ordered for butter nan and murg malai masala. We were already stuffed so we couldn't finish all and packed the rest. The nan was hot and was soft. The murg malai masala felt amazing to the taste buds. The gulab jamun and phirni served their purpose well as desserts. We had a great experience visiting the place.

Amazing is the word for food,ambience, staff courtesy and overall experience. The ambience was really good, ITC afterall, has to be amazing. We had a complimentary mocktail named Italian smooch and it was really good. We tried the 5 course dinner. For the starters there were fish tikka, mutton seekh kebab, chicken malai kebab. All of them tasted good. For the main course they had kulcha/naan/paratha, dal makhani and chicken butter masala. All these are the signature dishes of Peshawari. Tasted amazing. For the dessert we tried rabdi and gulab jamun. Gulab jamun was good, rabdi could have been better. There was also complimentary pans of various flavour. An amazing experience, would love to visit again, Worth every penny.

Hopeless restaurant. Had made prior booking on 12/08/2017 at 10 pm. Reached the restaurant at 9.45 pm. Assured of a table in 10-15 minutes. Was made to wait for 1.5 hours. Finally, got the table at 11.10 pm. Was served food 11.45 pm. Now, the food quality was a bigger issue here. Back home, was feeling nauseated and had 2 episodes of vomiting in the night. Clearly, it was food poisoning. 
Not going to this restaurant in my lifetime again.

I first across the daal bukhara at the frontier province at hotel tuli international in nagpur. The taste was delectable and i have been searching for the same taste here in kolkata. My quest for bukhara ended here in peshawari at itc sonar.
As you enter sonar take your left go straight take another left and follow the flight of stairs going down there lies peshawari.

We went for the crystal menu, a celebratory menu designed to celebrate 15yrs of its inception.
The place has an amazing decor with low stools and rustic interiors. They do not provide cutlery as they believe in having food with your hands here in peshawari. The bib on the table is quiet thoughtful to keep your clothes stain free while enjoying the food to your fullest with your hands.
We had the kebab platter for starters which included the murgh malai kebab, fish tikka, mutton seekh kebab. The kebabs wre succulent soft and the servings were generous. For the main we ordered daal bukhara,murgh makhni, butter naan and garlic naan.
The daal bukhara was amazing( it is cooked over 18hours). Murgh makhani was very tasty and exuded the flavour of fresh tomato puree as compared to other places where it tastes like fresh cream.
For dessrts we ordered a phirni and falooda kulfi both were very tasty.
The service was very warm and the waiters were very obliging. An amazing place to go for aunthentic north-west frontier food.
Kudos to itc team for bringing my quest for bukhara to an end and making me relive the nostalgia again.

We were there in Aug . It was my first experience in ITC AWADH CUSINE. We were not disappointed, but not overjoyed as well in terms of food quality vs price charged. Definetely the food was sufficient for what we ordered and quality was good , but for  4 persons 12000 INR seems bit pricy. In that price we can have 2* michelen in europe. Perhaps the price is because its 5* so taxes are quite high compared to others.So they need to think distinguish and be innovative in their cusine compared to others for the extra price. Having said that i will definetly say staff was very courteous and took care to give a fine dining experience.overall it was a nice experience but needs some punch to stay competetive in the market.

There has always been a deep bond with ITC Sonar, Kolkata, A Luxury Collection Hotel. My father used to take me there when I was a little child. Being mesmerized by the grandeur yet touched by the hospitality, I used to feel elated every time I stepped in. 
I have grown up. Time has passed. But the feeling remains the same. 
As ITC Sonar steps into their 15th year of glorious existence, I would personally like to congratulate the brilliant team and their dedication behind everything that we have experienced till date.

Tried the Crystal Menu at Peshawari.
The set menu serves the famous Dal Bukhara- which is cooked for 24hours before it is served to you, delicious mix of kebabs(best one from the platter: Murg Malai Kabab) which melts in your mouth, perfect choices of bread/ Anurag Agha suggested the Butter Garlic Naan, and it was totally worth it! Not to forget the lovely desserts! The list includes Phirni, Gulab Jamun, Rasamalai and I was suggested the Kulfi by Binit Das! Trust me, I have never had a better Kulfi anywhere before.
You can (read: you must) order your choice of beverages. I was suggested ITC Sonar's Vino Della Casa, a Vintage 2011 selection of red wine. Highly recommend, once again.
Also, thank you so much for the beautiful #InstaCongratulations cake that was so delicately made for @ig_Calcutta's 2nd birthday! What a surprise! We cannot thank you enough.

**The ambience has a perfect Indian touch and they do not supply you with cutlery as the rule is to eat with your hands. Don't forget to take a paan of your choice on your way out!

Planned to celebrate our anniversary here over lunch, and came out extremely happy. The ambience, as expected couldnt have been better. The food is heaven. There's plenty on the menu to try out and this time, we tried the lobster tandori and kasturi kebab. The chicken in the kebab was smoked to perfection and the tenderness added to the perfection. Lobsters have always been my weakness and today, it didnt disappoint.
Special mention for shantanu basu, our host today. You rocked. Thanks for the anniversary cake. Loved the hospitality.

Among all the luxury dining places I have been to in the city, this is one place which has highly impressed me. The ambience is very elegant. The paneer tikka.. To start off with was amazing with the perfect blend of spices. I am not really a paneer person but this dish managed to impress me though. The dal bukhara and a chicken dish(I don't remember the name ) with naan were too good. The chicken was cooked to perfection and was succulent as well. Don't forget to try out the kulfi which is another wow. The food was amazing but the staff were more amazing. Highly courteous and welcoming. Pranav and Binit (if I am not wrong)  were very helpful and friendly. Keep up the good work and I shall be back soon!!

Visited this restaurant on my parents anniversary.Was absolutely awed by the interior decor and the total aura that this place offers.
This restaurant mainly focuses on the North-Western cuisine.For starters they serve you with their non-veg kebab platter which is absolutely soft,succulent and melt in the mouth.Needless to say,the main course and desserts were equally good.Also they brought a beautiful cake to celebrate my parents anniversary.This humble gesture created an everlasting impression.Overall,an evening well spent!

I visited Peshawri on my parents anniversary. They don't give spoons and forks, and encourage us to eat with our hands. 
Talking of the ambience, it gave a complete Indian feel and the decor was very pleasing and we loved it.
We ordered onion kulcha, tandoori roti, Dal Bukhara, panner makhani. All the food was really tasty and not at all rough on the stomach. Dal Bukhara is a must. 
The best is yet to come-desserts! We ordered kulfi and Gulab Jamun. One being hot and the other being cold. The gulab jamun was soft and melted in our mouths, whereas the kulfi was cold and yummy! 
But apart from all this, I was throughly impressed when they stood by their word and brought a cake to celebrate my parents anniversary! It was beautifully decorated and very tasty! 
The service is also very prompt and the staff very courteous! Thank you so much for making this day just as I wanted it to be.. 
I will surely visit again! :)

It was a good experience at first , but the food which was the primary reason for our visit, was not upto the mark . The daal bukhara was underdone, and the methi paratha was rather too dry. The lamb and chicken kebabs were moderately good. 
The presentation of food in copper utensils, was a lovely improvisation. 
The hotel staffs and people from management were extremely helpful and friendly.

I have been to ITC Sonar many a time but tried Peshwari for the first time. I went through many of the reviews here before going there. I would say that the standard is falling at ITC over the years though the price is going up. When you visit a 5* hotel, you expect the ambience to be good. Same was the case with Peshwari - the ambience was good but nothing out of the world. You can get a similar experience in many restaurants nowadays. The restaurant was at the basement so we had to take the stairs. However, I didn't notice any lift which could be availed by elderly or those with special needs...at least it wasn't visible. The food was good... We ordered chicken tandoori, daal Bukhara, kulcha and butter naan. Daal Bukhara was very nice. Chicken tandoori was good. Naan was ok types. Coming to seating comfort, this is very poor. The seats are very uncomfortable and don't have backrest. We changed our seat once and the service quality became very very poor. The waiters were sloppy in moving the plates and forgot to shift the hand towels. There were three waiters serving 10 odd tables and they were literally running around. Our waiter suddenly got us a bill towards the end without asking me! I asked him about corporate discount and he said "you didn't tell me". I told him that he didn't ask before billing.He went back and got me a fresh bill. 
I feel in hospitality industry, customer satisfaction is primary. And if you are going to a premium place, the expectation is a lot more as you are spending quite a lot. Peshwari doesn't fit that class. In fact if you compare with Taj Bengal or Marriott, they really really need to improve a lot in customer service. That warmth is lacking which you can feel in the other star restaurants.

Got pc of mutton in my dal and when complain was done they tried to hide the fact that it was not pc of mutton and instead I was told that its ginger garlic paste and I asked them to get the plate but they didn't get the plate out of the kitchen so it was an easy escape for them. Such stuff is not expected from ITC hotel when it was proved that its Mutton they simply came up and told sorry. 
They didn't have the courtesy to ask if i had my meal ? Nor did they have a manner to get me fresh plate to have my food. 

ITC quality has and is going down. 

Worst experience.

Perfect ambience and really good food .¬†
To start off - Peshawar always nails off the Paneer Tikka - it is usually my favourite - so soft with perfect spices . Loved the Prawns - ¬†Nawabi Jhinga ¬†if i can correctly remember . Soft tender juicy prawns cooked perfect .
No meal is complete in Peshawar without the Dal Bukhara - the signature dish with bubbling butter along with the Garlic Naans . To complete the meal The Kulfi and Falooda was fabulous

One of the best restaurants I've ever dined in. The ambiance and music was soothing and in sync with the name and the food. The taste of food was up to the mark. The texture, especially of their dal was perfect. 
There was a small unfortunate incident which occurred however the service and hospitality shown by the staff was so courteous that I do not even feel like mentioning the incident in this review. 
This rating of 5 is just because of the service and hospitality. 
I highly recommend Peshawri for a romantic date and/or a family dinner.!

Went there for a corporate dinner with a visiting customer. There were 3 of us. We asked for the Samudra thali ---- but I was told that to order this platter you needed to have a minimum of six people !!!! So we were forced to order individual dishes, which turned out to be costlier. We frequently go to Peshawari for similar dinners and have not faced this in the past !!!  This rule is not mentioned in their menu as well !!!! So was disappointed !!!

Anyway, the food was great as usual. We had lobster, jhinga, chicken malai kebab, sheek kebab, sikandari raan, daal bukhara, assorted breads and kulfi.

From the quality of food to its ambience and the services, it was totally an awesome experience for me in this poila baishak. Among my favourite cuision, it was tandoori lobster and dal bukhara. Also the butter nun was quite soft and yummy. Overall, it has became one of my dream dining place.

Visited the restaurant on occasion of our anniversary. I just loved their total aura, starting from the afghani decor to their ambience every thing was breathtaking.. food is great and presentation is even greater where u will be provided with long aprons and you will have to eat your food using your hands.. We ordered daal bukhara which was just awesome, naan was  soft , butter chicken gravy was smooth with perfect blend of all Indian spices, and kebab platter which had different varieties of chicken kebabs as mutton we don't have.. I think it is for this kind of experience that people would love to go there over and over again..

Visited the restaurant on occasion of my wife's birthday. As is expected from any restaurant in a 5 star hotel, the setting and quality of food is excellent. The staff is extremely courteous and helping. Special mention for Shantanu who not only helped us order but attended us during the entire time of our visit.
The ambience is good but could have been done with a more rustic setting; would have been much more impressive with a typical NW frontier decor.
The food is probably the best in Kolkata. The fish tikka we had for starter was just done right with the freshness and taste of the fish locked in. The dal bukhara was the best that I have ever tasted; this is their signature dish and is worth every Rupee. The sikandari raan was juicy and soft; as per Shantanu, they do not accept raan weighing more than 1.5 kg. I found the claim to be true going by the taste and softness of the meat. The food was wholesome, feeling and very tasty.We had a glass each of a white wine from Argentina, which was again Shantanu's suggestion. The wine was just perfect accompaniment with the fish tikka.
They provided us with a complimentary cake, as it was a birthday celebration, which was very good.
Overall, a fantastic experience and definitely worth a re-visit.

The mocktails also called for a repeat with strawberry and guava flavour .. don't remember the name but i still have the flavour on my tongue 
The place definitely calls a visit again n again 
Limited menu but great dishes
A dish that demands special attention is mixed/ pineapple yoghurt yummylicious

Went last night with my wife. had a awful experience in Peswawari. First they dont have many drinks which is mentioned in menu card. Then the plates are all pale and colors fades in patches.. when I asked they replied " We wash it regularly thats why ? " This is too much. The staff were in hurried mode. They were rushing to take out the plates as early as possible .... lastly the "pan" .. its so awful ... Very very bad experience for very highly paid dinner .

My father and I have a thing for this place, especially their Burra Kabab, which is stunning. Primarily a place where we go to have an assortment of kababs, kaali daal, and rotis, what I find quite amusing is their insistence to eat with your hands, and the refusal to provide cutlery. They also make several fish kababs which my mother loves, and although the menu is small, the dishes are all superbly executed.

From where do I begin..  ITC is probably the best hotel in kolkata then there is Peshawari one of its restaurant with very a desi ambience and a touch of a 5 star hotel..  The starters are delicious with ample serving for 2 then we ordered for the legendary Dal Bukhara and bread basket..  The Dal is simply the best Dal one can ever have. It's full of flavours,  what aroma what taste, it truly made my anniversary..  In the end they gifted us a delicious cake which literally melted in my mouth.. Thank you ITC for making my evening one of the most memorable.

Peshawri, your "pesha" 'wri'cks my foodie heart today, however it is partly aided by your exquisite and immaculate ambience...
But you won't spend nearly 5-6k just to relish only the ambience, will you? 
Well, let me come to the main point of saying so...
We have visited this place today as it was in our wishlist for many days and we have had tandoori chicken, laccha paratha, paneer makhni and firni...
The main thing I would like to say is that all the food are very much overpriced and I did not find a single reason to say anything in support of this prodigal price! Yes I've been in many other 5 star restaurants and that all are expensive too, but I always find a reason to justify the price! But this place is certainly not even near to those...
The tandoori chicken that was priced more than 2k had nothing extraordinary taste in it... You can have even better tandoori chicken in oudh or in waterside cafe of hyatt...
Laccha paratha and paneer makhni was served along with starter and guess what, after finishing the starter when we are about to have paratha, it was not paratha at all, seemed like it was made of leather!!
Paneer makhni was okay, and I must say the taste paneer was extremely delicious...
Now coming to the Dessert...
When you are charging 750 for a dessert, one thing you should keep in mind that atleast it will be of good quantity rather than Satyanarayan's prasad, no matter how much delicious it tastes!!
So, if you guyz have a lots of money to waste then must visit this restaurant!
And if you are a devotee of good food, just like me, DON'T EVER VISIT THIS RESTAURANT, there are lots of north indian restaurants in this city that serve way better food at an affordable price to satisfy your foodie heart...
 Oh and yes, your pocket too...

If you are living in Kolkata and haven't had a visit with your family to the Peshwari in ITC Sonar's signature offerring,  you have surely missed onto something. 

I first had a culinary delight when I first visited the " Bukhara" in ITC New Delhi and had a rugged blast at the Daal Bukhara, Baddi Kabab and onion kulcha.

I was taken by suprise when I was told by the managers @ Peshwari, ITC Sonar Kolkata , that they replicate the Bukhara offerring here in the heart of Kolkata. 

By Dec 2016 I had twice visited the Peshwari with a fairly large group size and taken benefit of the Bukahara style food in an ambience, that is surely unparallel anywhere in the eastern part of this country. 

Daal Bukhara and Mutton based kababs are surely to ignite the zest in the heart of a rugged foodie as me, and the fish kababs add a smooth texture to the finish. You have a host of kulchas to choose from and if you are a veggie there are many good options for you as well.

They serve the best drinks on request and service is world class by all means. My special accolades for the team of Chefs who make this restaurant stand as outstanding.

drawbacks no cutlery imagine hot dal and starters how you eat without spoon or fork.
menu has everything but no rice items. 
seats the have without backrest.
interesting part they will give you bib or apron to wear before you eat. reminds we are back to childhood.
overall food is good and nice.
nothing much available for in Jain food.
but one who is nonveg  will love the food a lot.enjoy cheers.

Peshawri is bound to offer you a magnanimous, royal, elegant and exotic dining experience. 
I had the privilege of dining at Peshawri only twice and my overall experience there was truly heavenly.

I tasted THE BEST kebab in my life, over the likes of Lamb Sheekh Kebab which I had in Lahore. 
Their Murgh Malai Kebab and Sikandari Raan were out of this world.
The savory spices, the myriad flavors, the juicy, tender meat made my taste buds dance with joy.
Their rich variety of Indian breads, from warm parathas to soft and buttery Naan(s) really intrigued me.
For the main course, I had Dal Bukhara and Paneer Makhni, which were cooked to perfection.

Went here for my parent's 30th anniversary and quite frankly I'm not completely impressed with Peshawri, love them ambience, theme, interiors.. the crowd that comes in is also excellent! However it somehow lagged in a few points which was not at all expected from the ITC dining standards.. firstly would like to say the service was not up to the mark.. the waiters seemed to be on autopilot mode... The personal touch was missing completely. We go to such places for the uber experience and that somehow didn't come through.. maybe they were understaffed or something not really sure.. but service was average.. food well we ordered Peshawri kebab(lamb), pomfret tikka and Kali daal to go with naans... Everything was delightful except for the lamb.. it lacked in taste big time.. the lamb would be an average pick.. the best one was the pomfret.. simply heaven.. thirdly, billing was delayed by 30 mins or maybe more.. towards the end I was feeling pretty irritated with the service and the lamb added to it.. all in all it's a great restaurant but service needs to be upped big time..!

To start with...
a. Grossly understaffed to cater the serving
b. Time between serving 2 starters gets minimum 30 min.
c. You will get frustrated and will compel you not to repeat the orders.
d. Taste wise the starters are good, however the main course and specially the deserts are  big lay down .

Being a such reputed enterprise , at least the service should be efficient like the other similar type of theme restaurants like BBQ nation , flame and grill etc.

Not a place for foodie.

One of the best place to have Kababs and North Indian food
The restaurant doesn't provide you Fock or Spoon.
Starter paneer tikka,Tandoori aloo,Tandoori phool three of them are delicious to have and quantity is too much.
Naan bhukhara is huge and crispy.
After so much of the stater we were not been able to finish naan bukhara
Paneer kurchan is paneer with tomato and capsicum is one of the best combination.
Fresh lime soda is so so.

We had Seekh kababs, fish tikka, chicken tikka. In main course, we had Butter Nan and Dal Bukhara and it ended with a tasty scoopful of chocolate ice cream. The ambience was lovely, with a soft melody being played.

The husband is very fond of their food. He finds it tasty, non greasy and cooked to perfection. Well, I agree with him on this point (for a change!). Now let's get to the facts --
What food we like --
Butter naan
Malai Chicken kebabs
Sikandari Raan
Daal Bukhara
No complains about the food or service. Although if you are in a rush, this is not the place for you. They take their own pace to serve. Also, be prepared to eat with your hands -- no cutlery provided for dining. But I am sure you would enjoy licking the daal bukhara from your fingers. The decor and the ambiance too is tasteful. My only glitch are the seats that have no backrest making it a little uncomfortable to sit for long.

The place is decorated well....staffs provide good service and are courteous and prompt...It has an open kitchen...provides good music...food was good...and I didn't find their signature dish - "daal bukhara" that special as they stated it to b cooked for some 24 hours....and one must have a fat wallet to taste all the best things here...overall good ‚ò∫

For north indian food i must say this is the best restaurant in kolkata under the banner of itc sonar bangla 5* 
Ofcourse u must have a fat wallet for that but the quality of the food is really out of the world which will not pinch in comparison
Further,though the menu is very limited but each and every dish from starter to desert are very authentic and sumptuous.

Went there a month back for dinner. Loved this place completely. The food was lip smacking and the service was excellent. However few things which needs attention 1)Chairs without any back rest. This is fine for a quick coffee but sitting there for a dinner becomes absolutely difficult especially for someone with a back pain. 2)Another thing is the no spoon policy. It is a good way to keep the Indian culture going but how do someone eat raita without a spoon????? I asked for spoon and was denied. I understand your culture but I wouldn't relish my food this way. Atleast provide a spoon on customer's request. You spoil the complete experience this way.

The place was the chosen dine out option on the husband's birthday! You expect a lot when you choose a fine dining place. The place has been standing tall for years now, this restaurant is the biggest possible example. The carpets are worn out, the seat colors have discolored and need a revamp! The place is done nicely and expands across a huge space.
The servers were extremely cordial and well behaved, as expected. As the name suggests, the place is famous for kebabs. We opted for the Peshawri Kebab, Onion kulcha, Barwa kulcha and Murg makhni. And the food was outstanding and hot and sumptuous! The food was more than enough for 2 people and we had to get it re-packed! :)

The place is very nice - decor , warm welcome by the staff. Anyway let's start with the food , we ordered lamb - which tasted ok nothing exceptional. Next we ordered grilled pomfret which was not good , in fact it had a smell.Naan and Dal Bukhara was good and so was the firni.. All together the food was just average!!

Have been reading about this place for a long time.finally made it there and it was a wonderful experience.the quality of food,service,ambience was very satisfying.the most important thing to be noted is no matter you arrive almost at the closing hour,they do ask you for a repeat or a dessert order which is missing in many busy bustling restaurants in the city...they are usually in a hurry to close.the decision to spend time with family at the peshawari was very wise.

awesome place to go, went there yesterday for anniversary celebration of parents, veg plater was amazing, main course was okay
Heard from lot of friends that Kali dal of this place is better than sonargaon of Taj Bengal, but sorry to say, dal of sonargaon is much much better.
Servicing was amazing, best thing was that they don't allow spoon, suggest to eat from hand.

I have ordered for cake , but later they did it complementary.

Interiors were amazing..

They are basically based on the north west frontier cuisineand they excel in everyway . Be it the food quality, behaviour, and value for money , everything is well taken care of üòä
Lemme start from the food menu, we had ordered the north indian buffet menu that they serve . Cost is 2250 + taxes person. They have a starter included which have lamb sausage , chicken reshmi kabab 2 pieces and a fish kebab. Coming to the main course they have butter nan, dal makhani and murg makhani and for desert you have to choose between firni, gulab jamun and kulfi . Firni Tastes like never before.
Only i didnot find the main course upto the mark.
Taxes are not much high, its like other restaurants only. Loacted on the ground floor of Itc Sonar , this restaurant should top your wishlist when you have a gmhuge budget üòä
Highly enjoyed RECOMMENDED

I had come here long back once on my birthday when my dad used to work for ITC and was a member of the club. That time, I didn't love veg dishes at all. But I clearly remember that their staff had suggested us to take the Daal Bukharawhi which I loved so much that my mother got a plate packed for home for me to have the daal. I also remember that the Mutton Burrah Kebab was very good. The butter naam and Prawn Malai was extremely tasty too. I can recall this much only for now. Happy Dining! :)

Went to this place with friends.... quickly sharing my thoughts -

What I liked -
1. Amazing ambience
2. Tasty food
3. Probably the best dal i have ever had (dal bukhara)
4. Tandoor pomfret was a pleasant surprise.

What can be worked on -

1. They dont provide cutlery. While i appreciate that this keeps the overall experience authentic, i think it will be good if they provide the same on request. Might get messy trying to eat everything with bare hands.
2. Most of the seats dont have a back support. This would make you stretcb your back every once in a while. Make sure that you specifically mention abt seats with back support when reserving your table.

Overall, a great culinary experience. Recommended for visit.

Lets be honest. To have a pure experience of your taste buds you must be open to new ideas. You will read the menu and say well I've had this before. Why would I Want to pay for something that is already on every single North Indian food menu in the country.  Well here is the thing, to truly taste the Original is a mind boggling experience. It will throw out all your concept of the standard fare that you have been having all these years.  That for you is Peshawari. 

There is no cutlery first of all(5 star Restaurant. And no cutlery!!!) . So you got to get in and get your hands dirty. 

It was my father's birthday and they made sure we were treated like VIP's. From the complementary cake to a constant waiter around the table felt special enough.  

Now for the food. 
Ordered Tandoori Bhakti and Sikandri Raan for starters. 
Bhetki was so fresh and such perfectly marinated you will not believe.  
They score their lamb specially from Rajasthan.  And it's lamb not goat. Perfect again. Beautifully shredded on the bone and absolutely tender. 
5/5

We ordered Daal Bukhara and Murgh Khurchan with butter Naan and kulcha.  

Just one word. Sublime. 5/5. 

They have set the standards so high for the dishes that are so common you would be taken aback. 

Keep up the good work.

This review was long overdue. Peshawri was on my wishlist for a long time mainly for the Dal Bukhara here is a favourite of many.

Coming to the restaurant, the amazing ambience and courteous staff will make your dining experience all the more amazing. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted warmly by the staff and escorted to your seat. The posh interiors provides a royal feel.

So we ordered Paneer Tikka and Tandoori Aloo as the starters. No cutlery was provided because they believe eating with your hands adds a different dimension to your food. That or not, the starters were lipsmacking nonetheless. The Paneer Tikka is the best I have had ever.

For main course we opted for Dal Bukhara, their signature dish along with Masala Kulcha. This Dal Bukhara exceeded expectations to say the least. Don't know how do they make it, but it was truly delicious. Again an experience worth remembering. The Kulcha was nice. Not much to add here.

For dessert we ordered Kulfi and trust me this again was an amazing experience. If you have been to Haryana and tried Kulfi's there, you would relate to the taste. Particularly I felt this was much more better than that.

No scope of deducting even a single star. This restaurant lives up to its name. Obviously it's way too costly but then it's situated in a 5 star and is one of the finest restaurants in India. Occasionally, one can definitely visit and enjoy a delightful North Indian meal.

If you are looking for royal treatment and world class food for a special occasion - this Afghan style live kitchen restaurant will humour you to moon and back. I took my parents for their anniversary dinner here a few months back and found it, for a lack of a more intense word, mesmerizing. Their food is sublime and their decor royal. Totally floored by them, I took my American client to give them a taste of Indian delicacies. What you should try? Everything!!!! Don't walk out of this place without trying their daal makhni and crispy seekh kebabs studded with green chillis and stuffed with cheese. Aah - I have to pay them another visit soon.

The decoration was grand with live kitchen nd da real feeling of afghan style.The w8rs were wearing kurta pyajama nd jackets which went perfectly with the theme.Maintaining traditionality they prefer eating with hands instead of spoons.We ordered chicken malai kebab nd fish kebab..chickn kabab just melted in the mouth..it was out of da world though the fish had a smell which none of us liked.Next we ordered lacha paratha,butter nan,dal bukhara nd da famous rann.dal bukhara and rann was simply mind blowing.lacha paratha was not to my liking as I was made of wheat but da butter naan was good.Overall the food was very good nd would definitely come back.

LOCATION:

Situated in the ITC Sonar Bangla hotel on EM Bypass, this is their In house North Indian Restaurant.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Peshawri is a branch off from ITC Hotel Group's world renowned North Indian Restaurant Bukhara. My visit to this luxurious restaurant has come late considering I am a fan of North Indian cuisine. Interiors are good but not great. They are quite basic and I guess I was expecting more from one of the most expensive restaurants in town. I found the seating to be uncomfortable honestly especially due to a lack of back rests on certain tables. I also found the tables to be a little too low and personally feel that people with lower back problems will have a very hard time. This is the sole reason for me to deduct my ratings of this restaurant.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Garlic Naan and Dal Peshawri.¬†

The Chicken Reshmi Kebab was an absolute show stopper. Huge chunks of chicken but perfectly marinated and cooked. One would imagine that such big chunks of chicken would not cook evenly but it was not the case. The marination was just right and the meat tasted fresh and juicy. Its how kebabs should be served.

The Garlic Naan was also absolutely smashing. I asked mine to be extra crisp and they hit the bully eye with the bread. It was light, crispy but soft enough at the same time. It had been garnished with the right amount of garlic which did not overpower the bread. I could just have the naan without any mains and still be a happy man.

The Dal Peshawri met my super high expectations. It was rich, creamy and had a great aroma to it. True it was really heavy and I could not manage a second helping, but it was great to taste. I did feel that a bit of chopped coriander would have done wonders as it would have helped cut through all the richness but then this was really no reason to complain.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Seating needs to be looked into. Beyond 45 minutes, I had to stand up and give my back a break which was aching. Peshawri true to its concept does not give cutlery to eat with as they encourage eating by hand. Yet I feel that they should provide the same upon request as many of us are more comfortable using cutlery especially to eat Kebabs. Eating chicken kebabs with bare hands does not paint a pretty picture but then I guess it adds to the truly carnivorous experience of gorging on a beautiful plate of Chicken Reshmi Kebab. So the best explanation to this point would be , "Either youll love it, or youll hate it".

VERDICT:

One of the great frontiers of North Indian food in Kolkata. Very expensive but then like Coco Chanel once said " The best things in life are priceless, but the second best are really really expensive ".

Absolute favourite for satiating the typical taste buds of an Indian. Very ethnic and traditional interior. Excellent service and hospitality. Their daal is a must try and it's the best of it's kind. The only tiny drawback is with the seating, the tiny stools aren't too comfortable.

Top notch food. We went for a family dining, and probably had the best meal of my life. The bill was a whopping 20k though. :D But to was worth every penny!  The ambience was amazing, the setting was perfect, I felt like a queen in the entire setup. Staff was super, impeccable manners. I have rarely seen such service anywhere else. Love ITC Sonar.

Went to Peshawri with my family on my birthday. Right from the moment you enter the place you know you are in for an amazing experience.
We received a warm welcome and were escorted to our booked seat by the waiter. They were in no rush to take our order and gave us ample time to decide. In the meantime we were offered papad and masala onions.
Coming to food, we ordered 2 Kebab platters which is a must try for all. All the Kebabs are lip smacking. In main course we ordered Dal Bukhara, Butter naan and Paneer. I swear by God, I have never tasted a better dal than this. This was better than Sonargoan (Taj Bengal) as well. In desserts we had firni which was again amazing. I was also given complimentary cake which acted as a surprise for me.
NB: They serve finger licking good food and hence don't provide Cutlery which adds up to the fun of eating.

Another 5 star visit by us! This time a treat from my elder brother!
Needless to say about the decor which is just outstanding! You will definitely feel you are somewhere in a restaurant of Peshawar! Staffs are very courteous and prompt!
We had gone with the set menu which served us with a plate of kabab each, naan and rotis along with non veg and veg sides and then a plate of desserts each! Since tasted all most all from the menu as we were 4!
Kababs were mouthwatering to look at and delicious to taste! I have never tasted such soft kababs with proper mix of spices! Heaven!
In veg side we took the kali dal which takes 2 days to get done! Was good! Non veg chicken dishes were truly amazing! Desserts were all indian ranging from Rasamalai, Gulabjamun, Pista coolfi, Firni!
Pocket pinch was 1100/- plus taxes for each!

We went to Peshwari during the restaurant week and was highly disappointed with both service and food. Meat and Fish kabaabs were too dry and all tasted the same. Chicken and Paneer in main course were just edible. The best of the lot was Daal Bukhara. The rasmalai and firni in the dessert menu were horrible and non-sweet.

For a 5 star restaurant it was a disappointment.

Went there on a Sunday. Since I am a vegetarian, this review might not be complete in itself as this is supposed to be more of a non-vegetarian's paradise. Ordered Tandoori Aloo for appetisers which was average. The tandoori aloo was accompanied by mint chutney. Next was main course which was paneer khurchan ( decent ) and my biggest disappointment of the dinner, Dal Bukhara ( yes, the legendary,probably the most popular dish to ever come out of ITC's kitchen. If you are not of the know, the legend has it that the Dal Bukhara is slow cooked for 48 to 72 hours ).  There was this imminent comparison with my experience at ITC Maurya's ( New Delhi ) version of the same and I must admit the taste was much better at the ITC New Delhi's outpost. So if you are looking for the eponymous Bukhara experience, you will be disappointed. Ordered Pudina Paratha and Onion Kulcha for breads which was again decent. I strongly suggest you order the Naan Bukhara if you are in a group of 3 or more people. The deserts consisted of gulab jamun which was nice enough and phirni which tasted more for the sugar conscious patron. Ambience is nice though seating is uncomfortable. Have to compliment the signature ITC hospitality though. They took good care of my friend and me throughout. I would rate my Delhi outpost's experience few notches higher than this so this might have been a reason for my disappointment. An extra half point for the warm hospitality though but when it comes to a restaurant everything else is secondary. It's only the food that makes  a customer, a patron !

One of the best place cuisines in the city or probably country to enjoy delicacies from North West Frontier. ¬†They only wide range of Indian breads which goes perfectly with the selection of dishes in menu.
We ordered two stalwarts from the menu called Dal Bukhara and Sikandri Raan. Was accompanied by Butter Naan.
Dal Bukhara is a cousin of the widely available Dal Makhani but here the dal is slow cooked overnight or may be more to give that creamy texture. However the first version served us had evidence of raw taste of cereals and less buttery and bland too. On sending it back the chef accepted his mistake and prepared the closest to signature version of it.
Sikandari Raan is the most marvelous dish I tasted ever. The meat melts inside your mouth and perfect balance of spice.
Butter Naan is the flaky layered raan which is soft and fluffy goes perfectly with either dal or raan.
However the saga is not over yet. How can we miss Rasmali and Kulfi. Rasmalai was rich with dry fruits cooked with milk and full of small paneer balls. What an exquisite dish. Lastly the creamy kulfi with rose water drenched faluda was just like perfectly scripted screenplay.
The servers were not trained at par to a five star standard. They were sloppy and were all over places. Had to get their attention even for glass of water. Ambiance with surely remind you of those scenes of Afgan shacks in movies. Don't forget sada and mitha paan while exiting the restaurant.

I had lunch in peshawri quite a few months back but totally missed on writing a review for it and after uploading all the pictures a few days back I finally decided to complete my review. We were three in a group and we made our reservations before hand. We reached on time and we're quickly ushered in our seats. On entering the place I noticed that the interior was done keeping in mind the food the serve. The place is well lit ,the tables are spacious and i noticed the staffs wearing the traditional attires at the same time they were very professional and knew exactly what they were doing. It was a Sunday afternoon and mostly all the tables were filled. We were given complimentary onion salad and papad to munch on. Their service time is not very fast but I did not complain as the food were very good. The fish kebab was quite big in size and very well cooked also the chicken tikka kebab was very tasty. I loved their seekh kebab which was excellent but the only thing we regret ordering was the tandoori phool as it was very bad. It had a huge amount of coating and the cauliflower was very bland inside as it was not at all marinated properly with the spices. Nevertheless we moved into our main course which included dal bukhara and murg makhani along with butter naan and bharwaan kulcha. All the items were excellent and we literally licking our fingers. 
Now comes my favourite part that is the dessert for which we ordered kulfis,  rasmalai, firni. The desserts were also very good and consistent. We were very satisfied with our lunch i.e. with the quality and the taste of food except the tandoori phool. 

P.s: as it was a long time back I may be wrong in naming few items and I apologise for the same.

Modelled on the famed Bukhara¬† at ITC Mayura, Delhi, this restaurant focusses on North-West frontier cuisine. It serves mainly kebabs, naans and of course their famous Dal Bukhara. There is no rice on the menu. The ambience is rustic. The guests sit on stools and are encouraged to eat with their fingers.

We started with the non-veg kebab platter of five varieties of meat. Also ordered¬† one fish kebab separately as the platter does not include seafood. The mutton barrah kebabs were excellent. Soft, succulent, melt in your mouth. The murgh malai was very good too. But the fish and seekh kebabs lacked the wow factor. Then came the raan, the naans and the dal. The raan and the naans were excellent. But for me, the dal, though quite good, did not quite live upto all the hype. I have eaten equally good or maybe even better dals at other places at a much lower price.¬† 
The service was warm and friendly throughout, although not always the most efficient. Overall, an evening well spent.

Beautifully decked ! 

Food :: 

We had ordered -:

1. An assored Platter which comprised of both chicken & mutton kebabs - bland & chewy .

2. Dal Bukhara - was amazingly yummy .

3. Butter naan & 

4. Khurchan Chicken - was the most delectable dish amongst all that we ordered . Moderately spiced & tangy . Loved it .

5. A peg of whiskey paired with Red bull .
6. A bottle of water

With the above list of food & beverage it came around 8.5 k for the 3 of us .  

Service ::

Was promt at the beginning , as were the second in number to enter the restaurant .  We were well assisted to our table & on choosing our choice of food  . Gradually , the service slowed down once other guests started filling in ( we had to wait for a good while to rinse our fingers &  call for finger bowls twice , after completing our meal ) .

This restaurant has been everyone's favourite since the time it has opened in Calcutta. It's been one of my favourite indian restaurants too and I have also been to many other outlets of peshawari. I visited the restaurant after a really long time last night and found out that this doesn't serve the same yummy food anymore. The "dal bukhara" is no longer the signature dal bukhara - it was completely bland, the breads were really thick, the chicken kurchan was still very good and spicy. I was really disappointed with the food being nowhere close to what it used to be. The prices have also gone up and it's not at all worth the money. Hope they get some better chefs with the old recipes. ITC

We went to Peshawri few days back for dinner. Not much need to be said about their hospitality and ambience. It is what you expected from ITC chain pf hotels. Decor was very tastefully done though I expected it to be more gorgeous. The best part was there visible kitchen (glass enclosure). I have not seen any kitchen so clean. It is indeed a very satisfying when you get to see your food is being cooked in front of your eyes. Coming to food we ordered two cocktails, peshawri kabab, dal bukhara, butter naan and pudina paratha. Cocktails were made to perfection and served in big glass. The kabab was very soft and tender. They do not give spoon as the tradition is to eat with your hands. Mutton was so well cooked that you can tear the pieces easilty with your fingers. Only down side is it was bit cold inside. Rest of the items were excellent to say the least. And their famous daal bukhara is heavenly. They moment they place the bowl on the table the aroma is fantastic. Pudina paratha and naan were again superb. You are bound to get a special feeling if waiter asks you whether you want your naan to be crispy or soft? You can expect that only here I believe.

As pathetic as it can get where you are paying a bomb for the food. The seating is very uncomfortable.  Not worth a place going

Well ITC group of hotels no doubt are a perfect destination for a comfortable stay. Not only that the restaurant's at the hotels are amazing!
I was at ITC peshawari for a quiet candle light dinner with the bf and was amazed by the arrangements made by these guys at peshawari. A secluded table for two, candle light, flowers.
With the ambiance set in place we ordered for the food. As customary it is, they served us warm towels to cleanse our hands because well peshawari is a no cutlery zone! Spoons are only for serving.
I didn't feel like wearing the apron but my date gladly obliged.
There was one portion of veg kebab platter with succulent Paneer tikka, tandoori aloo, veg phool(cauliflower)
The non veg platter had fish, chicken, lamb.
Mulled wine was served which went superbly well with the food. The red wine was spiced with cinnamon, star anise and orange rind and smelled and tasted divine.
For main there had to be the acclaimed dal Bukhara which indeed is the best dal makhni in the world. Slow cooked over 48hours and simmered in butter, this dal is the best!
There was Paneer pasinda too accompanied by rotis (nan and tandoori) and the very gorgeous raita!
For dessert I tasted the Ras malai on the managers suggestion and my date devoured the steaming gulab jamun
Since it was Christmas eve they served us an amazing chocolate ganache cake (complimentary) which we packed for home.

The service was impeccable and the food Delicious as always!

Recommended: veg kebabs platter, dal Bukhara, raita, Ras malai.

Everything is fantastic. I enjoyed my dinner there. Staff is well trained, decent and suggestive also.
Food is as usual very very tasty specially DAL BUKHARA.

After a long time of planning, finally went to Peshawri for lunch, with two friends.
The food was okay I would say, honestly. My expectations were much higher from it. 
The kebabs were good but there wasn't any wow-factr to them. The gobi starter was downright bad, with clumpy dry layers of besan coating. The main course and desserts too were nothing to fall in love with.
The service was slow, and the servers weren't the politest in town.

Me and my school friends have this ritual that we go for new year dinner on 1st of January. So this time around we ended up at Peshawri in ITC.

We did not have a booking and were accommodated after a few minutes. The staff was courteous and helpful. The decor was good and the seating can be a bit more comfortable. One thing notable about this place is they do not serve cutlery.

We ordered for Tandoori aloo and fish tikka for starters. The fish tikka was absolutely exquisite and the tandoori aloo was nice but could do with a bit more spice. I think that was the case with pretty much all the food other than the fish tikka. For main course we called for murgh makhni and dal bukhara. Both were pretty average. I really expected better food here. 

The service is also a bit on the slow side as they do take quite sometime to get the order and even the bill. 

The bill was 9000 for 6 people without alcohol. Definitely expensive but then considering that its a 5 star property it is alright. Could do better !

Not at all bad.Been there for the first time, liked the ambience. Ordered roti,which is highly overpriced. 180 /-for each roti. Tastes good. Had an anniversary there. Dal Bukhara not good at first, but served fresh and hot later. Heavenly. Firni equal to overpriced.500 /-for single Firni. Overall nice,with biriyani of average cost and good taste,except for Firni, which you get at aminia for 50/-.Got heavenly but complimentary coke with pudina, coriander and cake(chocolate truffle) for anniversary. Excellent courtesy.

The best thing about the place was you have to enjoy your food by using your hand... deco was awesome... yes perfect ambience... gone there during last Valentines Day... staffs are so friendly... and service was undoubtedly excellent... now coming to there food, first came the eye smoothing sparkling wine... awesome, followed by the non veg kabab platter... of with the prawn and fish kebab was not very good but the chicken and mutton was excellent... then came the butter nan, dal makhani and chicken butter masala as main course.. and the combination was just out of the world.. I can still feel the taste... ended up with rasmalai... very very good.. but since I am a dessert loving person gone for there kulfi.. yummy... Amazing experience... Pocket pinch was ok considering the star rating of the place...

Have been looking forward to visit the Kolkata edition of this famous restaurant. Finally got a chance to do so this Durga Puja time. My personal favorites has always been Sikandari Raan, Dal Bukhara and assortment of breads. I'm a big fan of the garlic naan they serve, also the roomali roti. We ordered the usual suspects, I'd always assumed the taste will be the same all across their establishments. I've frequented Bukhara in ITC Maurya and Peshawari in ITC Grand Maratha, sadly the Kolkata version came a distant third in comparison to it's other siblings.

To my disappointment, Sikandari Raan was way too salty and didn't have that signature texture. The best part was the people managing the restaurant were fabulous. They took note of my displeasure and provided me with a freshly prepared portion of the Raan. Voila this time the chef got it right. It tasted just like it should be.

The other aspect which was a bit off, was the roomali roti which was leathery and chewy, highly uncharacteristic.

Overall, I think it's a good place to go...if not for anything but just for the Dal.

Dal bukhari has always been ITCs favourite dish.. A kulfi faluda or phirni in dessert is also amazing..

If you want to celebrate a special occasion with your dear ones and you dont mind going a little over budget.. It is a place to be..!!

I think nothing can beat the Daal Bukhara and Pudina Paratha of Peshawri.
My love for Pudina Paratha started from this place.
And I have never been particularly fond of North Indian so much. But this place makes me fall in love with Indian cuisine again and again. There is no one dish in the menu which is not up to the mark.
Kudos keep it going like this.

Peshwari celebrates Indian food at the most royal and opulent setting. However, its not just not the interiors which are mesmerising, the food is equally palatable. I highly recommend the assorted veg platter (consisting of wide variety of kebabs)and the Dal makhni ( simply superb). However, the other items are equally enjoyable. Peshawri also boasts of a well stocked bar and great indian desserts. The service is prompt and waiters well informed.

Peshawai never fails to delight us. Food quality is maintained over the years abd even with its selected veg options its always a treat to be here. We dined last night and found the food a bit too spicy than usual. Apart from that the kebabs n dal were as good as ever. Being in a 5 star its obviously heavy on the pocket.

If you are a person who like variety go for their platter they provide a reasonable assortment. In Case you have any favourites, don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed.
                      The menu is extremely limited. Everything is dry except for the daal. However, every individual dish they offer is an art in itself.¬†
                                            All in all, a wonderful place...very heavy on the pocket, but the food gives justice for the price it commands.

Its an interesting concept restaurant. Just kebabs, and no silverware. Simply dig in desi style. 
The kebabs are good. As good as they should be for the price. The siikandri raan was something to die for. 
I dont usually like food at five star hotels but I would go back here whenever I was in the mood for a lot of kebabs.

Peshawari was in my wishlist for long time but pocket pinch was not permitting me. Then came the restaurant week India festival, in which selected top restuarants serve their signature dishes in a set meal at a reasonable price @ 900 + taxes.  Taking the opportunity went for a wednesday lunch with wife.
As we entered the restuarant,  we adored the ambience.  We got a warm welcome there and were escorted to a table of your choice. Our set meal included 2 starters, 1 main course, 1 staples and 1 desert for 1 person.
As we were 2 people we decided to taste each dish. In starters they served 4 starters and one starter they served us complimentary. Paneer tikka was tasty and soft. Tandoori Gobi was below average. Subz sekh kabab was average as it was very dry. Tandoori stuffed capsicum was different and was worth trying it. Best for us was tandoori aloo. It was the best I have ever had. A must try.
Main course was served hot. Dal makhani was very good. Paneer makhani was a waste. Stuffed kulcha was soft and tasty. Pudina paratha had chaat masala and oreganoes all over it, so dnt like it.
Rasmalai was sofy tasty. But the best was hot gulab jamun. It was just divine. Soft and hot and it taste took me to a different world. We also tried a mocktail called fatal attraction. It was a blend of lithi and orange. It was very refreshing.
Staffs were polite and courteous. One different thing about peshawari is that they insist on having food with your hand rather than with spoons or folks. Overall it was a great experience to try a five star restuarant and eat a full course meal at a price at which you could only have one dish.

Had a grand sunday lunch yesterday @ Peshawri, ITC Sonar yesterday. The interiors are typically in shades of north west frontiers and the staff dressed in the traditional afgan suits.The food is beyond words..we went accordind to the suggestions from them..and had
MURG MALAI KEBAB and LAMB BARRAH KEBAB in starters. The lamb came in two huge chunks, soft ,however i would have preferred it to be softer , kind of melt in the mouth types but perfectly seasoned with spices and yogurt, it deserves to be their signature. The chicken kebabs were tender and well prepared, great in quantity , but to be over honest i had its better variant at kaafila.

The mains we chose for BUTTER NAAN and GARLIC NAAN with MURG MAKHANI and DAL BUKHARA. The breads were perfect...crispy n flaky outside and soft n doughy inside with dollops of meting butter spread on them. The chicken makhani was tad too sweet for us , but again very tender meat in a sweet n tangy gravy..the real beauty was their signature DAL. I wish i could go on having butter naan with dal for my every meal every day..trust me..i left those meaty kebabs n makhani and filled myself up with just that dal and naan.

Desserts were very average i would say, lacking any innovation and punch..we had regular phirni and koolfi with falooda , both of them were just good.

In short , if u are there at peshawri , and u miss that DAL BUKHARA , u missed everything about that place ! Go and have it again :)

Had been in ITC Sonar after years....And this time for Peshawri on 22 Aug. This time they were celebrating by giving their dishes In roll out prices of 2002. First of all I would say about their hospitality, u would like to visit them again and again because of their conduct . Now comes the main part food. We ordered the famous# Sikandari Raan and # Peshawari kebab .The Sikandari Raan was jus not yummy but was also super soft. It was cooked for several hours and  not at all oily . That was surely the best part. Then for main course we ordered their special #Dal Bukhara with butter nun and bharwan kulcha. The bharwan kulcha was stuffed with paneer and was soft. Butter num was also nice. Another awsome dish was the dal Bukhar as it is cooked overnight with slight flame It was also with minimal oil and a bit of ajwain flavour and u would surely smell the roast flavour as it is cooked above wood and coal in a traditional way. All over an awsome experience . Atleast one time visit must.

Its 5-STAR hotel, i think its not required to explain about ambience. Starting from entry gate to entrance, outstanding gestures n welcoming staff. The word is NAMASTE. Now the main thing is food. Taste of food could be either good or bad. Nothing else. Here i would rate the food 3/5. Cannot say fantabulous or wow. it was my wife's bthday and they gave complimentary cake. I left the table for a call and when I came back I found the waiter having words with my wife, this also symbolize that they don't want to make customer feel lonely or bore. They keep entertaining.
We had 4 pieces of Nuns, Chicken gravy, dal bukhari.. Rs.3025.
But the service will make you feel wow. Something to cherish.

Tucked into the basement near Dublin at ITC is a subtle yet rich retro style Indian restaurant. Though not many options on the wooden menu but yet a must place to go for Dal Bukhara and some of the best Indian breads served in Kolkata. 

Not very bright and use of a lot of wood and brown makes it feel more traditional in a modern built hotel transporting you to the retro world of luxury dining over an Indian meal. All the more, you are greeted by a table with loads of condiments on arrival, and also on departure. In all hospitality at its highest spirits makes the visit worth every bit spent here.

If u realy crave for kababs then this is your place.The succulent kababs taste very different than what you are used to in kolkata!
 The unique feature that you find here is wooden menu with no use of cutlery!..Direct hand to heart connection it seems..!
 When you are savouring the tenderalacious chicken,mutton kababs dont forget the MUST have DAL BUKHARA in the main course.The thick silky texture proves that yeah its been churned whole night!.Its robust taste goes exactly with nun,pudina paratha.We also orderd a murg afghani which was soo soft,melts right in your mouth.
 The stony setup,afghani dress code reminds you of arabian nights!.You cant find too variations out here and little thing that striked me was there sitting discomfort! But my dinner treat to my parents dint turn out grey with that and do hope to come back again.üòÉ

I have no words when it comes to itc.jz go there. I had a seat booked 2 days before before going for the grand date.The ambience was really great. They maintained the look and feel of Peshwars. The waiters were very helpful with the menu and I must say excellent service.
Now coming to the delicacy , it was too good. I must say the best lamb kebab I ever had. It was perfectly smoked. We had a chicken dish..forgot its name with butter naan. The food was very good overall.
Now coming to spirits,u must try out margarita. The classic martini was also good in taste but I would prefer margarita over martini.
We ended up spending 4.8k which is quite heavy on pocket.overall it was a great experience.

Beautiful place. Delightful,cozy ambience. Great food as expected. Wide choice in menu. Obnoxiously expensive though but you get bang for the buck you spent. Only con is that the waiters do not keep the entire dishes on the table and serve as and when required. This creates a confusion about the amount of food left if at all and often leads to wastage. Overall a must visit if you want to loose yourself in some Arabian delights.

When you look at the menu, you will be wondering if this is really it or have they not listed all the items? Limited Mughlai cuisine is what is served here and if you are looking for a bigger spread then you need to visit the others in the same hotel. Cutlery not offered unless you really ask for it.. Which meant that you could enjoy the food the way you wanted and not bother about people staring at you! Good ambience and amazing service! Worth a visit if you dont mind a hole in your pocket :)

Horrible service, terrible food, highly overpriced is all I can say about this place. The waiters were kind of deaf and dumb and rude and ignored us half the times we asked for something. They even picked up our food while we were eating and we were supposed to get that packed. While packing, they forgot about the naans which was vital obviously. Probably never going back there again unless they make up for their previous blunders and improve their food along with their service. And this isnt the first time something like this has happened

One word for the experience - Perfect. Kebab platter is the best way to start the meal. Dal bhukhara and laccha paratha is all you need for the main course.A little heavy on the pocket but totally worth it.

Taste - 5/5 
Ambience - 4/5

When the inspiration behind a restaurant is The Bukhara from the Maurya New Delhi,it is a tough act to follow,even though both are from the same group.The Peshawari has rigorously tried to invoke the same atmosphere at The Sonar,Kolkata with the wooden tables,the stools and even the wooden menu.Overall ambience is warm,spacious and there might be some celebrity shoulder rubbing as well.
We asked for Murgh Khurchan,Tandoori Jhinga and Mutton Kabab along with Dal Bukhara and a mix of Butter Naans and kulchhas.The closest thing to the original Bukhara was the Dal.The Chicken was very good too.But the Bara Kabab was ordinary,undercooked,even a little cold.And the prawn was outright smelly.When pointed to the waiter,there was a polite nod but nothing else.And since it was pretty late we did not pursue it farther.But considering the prices and having eaten here a number of times before I am a little disappointed at the fallen standards of this once revered restaurant.

We will surely return to Peshawri soon Hungary for more!

Everything was brilliant out there!The food was extremely delicious.
First we ordered a chocolate cake to celebrate my mum and granny's birthday. Then we ordered the kabab platter which included many kinds of kababs like reshmi kabab, seekh kabab, etc. And for the main course we had Murg Khurchan and Butter Nun. Everything was damn good. The serving was also pretty quick.
I just LOVED IT!

I wish there were negative ratings on Zomato, as this place deserves nothing but a -5. I Had the worst experience ever at this so called fine dining restaurant. Due to the presence of VIPs, we were denied proper service. We experienced everything, from discourteous staff to horrible food.Food was served after an hour and fifteen minutes of placing the order. Reasons given by the incompetent staff included that we had ordered Naan Bukhara (which supposedly take an hour to prepare), We were a very big group (15 people), the order placed by us was very big. To top it all, being a group of strict vegetarians, two of the guests were served chicken tikka masala instead of Paneer Tikka masala. At the end of the dinner, my friend who was celebrating her birthday at Peshawri, was served room temperature Mousse cake. In all, I had the worst experience I had ever imagined. Will definitely not visit this place again! The staff was also unapologetic. I sincerely hope the management reads this review!

Visited this place on my parent's 25th anniversary and was pretty proud of my choice :D Okay,gloating over...
The ambience is nice...Waaaaaay better than Dum Pukht, although service can be better. We were actually afraid that the boy,yes boy, who was serving us would probably trip and fall,the way he was running around.
Service was a bit slow but maybe that was intentional...Food tastes so much better when you're famished!
Now,we ordered the half kebab platter,consisting of 12types of kebabs and I THINK I DIED FOR A FEW MINUTES,WENT TO FOOD HEAVEN,ATE THE LAMB KEBABS,and came back to life ;) THE LAMB KEBABS ARE TO DIE FOR!!
We'd also ordered Chicken kurchhan, butter naan, onion naan and daal bukhara.The onion naan was terrific although I've had better butter naan elsewhere. Also ordered the Crocodile Dundee.It was REALLY good! The carnivore inside me gave the daal a cold shoulder though...It was nothing special,and hence quite anti-climactic! :(
I liked the fact that they kept the salad supply going without much ado.They also surprised us with a complimentary chocolate mousse cake to celebrate the occasion and it was a perfect ending to the perfect evening!
Bill came to almost seven grand but I guess you can't expect it to be very reasonable in a place like the ITC Sonar...Brand matters!

This is your place for the best afghani food. But if you're a vegetarian don't worry. The paneer is the softest I've ever had. Do order paneer tikka and chicken seekh kebab in starters. The mains are okay , but the most mandatory thing to order is dal Bukhara. I have never loved any other dal so much. You can order the family naan if it's a large group of people , otherwise the normal naan and tandoori rotis are good enough.

Aa per him his taste bud knew wat exactly dal bukhra is.... As for me , being a first timer in ITC SONAR PESHAWARI , i couldnt tell d difference,experience was gud..slow service... Breads very average ... Mixed raita ordered looked more like a cream with good presentation but i was confused why they named it raita.... Overall i wont visit again this joint ...

The ITC hotels all over take their food and their guests very very seriously. Whether it is Peshawari, Bukhara, Jolly Nobobs or the West View Bar and Grill, both the food and the service is impeccable! 
My tryst with the North west frontier food started almost 14 years back at Bukhara @ the Maurya Sheraton in Delhi. Those days we didn't have Zomato otherwise I would have reviewed the place and its food then and there. Any how now that we have that advantage let me do he honours. I have been to the Peshawari a couple of times and every time I have come out with a smiling face. Starting from the rustic ambience of the stone floors and walls to the wooden chair and tables everything just seamlessly merge with the theme.
I have always kept my choices of dishes very basic and to the point. The Peshawari raan, kakori kebabs, murgh malai kebabs, daal  and naan. Till date the food always taste the same....a cut above the rest. 
The raan is beautifully marinated and then grilled to perfection and I just love the smokey and the charcoal flavour. The meat just falls off the bone. The kakori kebab just melts in the mouth and is perfectly mildly spiced that leaves a subtle after taste in your mouth. The murgh malai kebab has a little robust taste but the layer of malai cuts a robustness a little bit and adds the subtlety. Now comes the dal. Rich, thick and silky in texture with full of flavour. The dal is a perfect example of what slow cooking for hours can do to the taste of a dish. The dal is amazing to taste. The naans are perfectly cooked in the tandoori and comes out soft and yet perfectly cooked. 
This is what fine dining is supposed to be. 
The Peshawari also stocks some of the best wines I have ever tasted and if you need suggestions they are ever helpful.

An exquisite ambience with super fine hospitality and the Mughal decor is the main charm. But with sad heart the food options are very limited. Best to have a kebab platter which cost around 2500/- apprx. The nice flavor will not give you a single moment to resist urself to jump on the food. But it can be more succulent compare to the price. The unique part is you have to use ur hand instead of cutlery set. Daal is their signature recipe. Indian desserts only available. Overall it's very heavy on the pocket compare to the food.

I have jumped for Peshwari for my birthday celebration after doing a lot of study on below reviews. I must agree on the decor part which everyone has mentioned. Very traditional North Indian decor with excellent stuff behavior.. They all were very helpful and always carrying a smile in face. We have ordered kebab platter, butter nun, laccha paratha, chicken malai something that I don't remember now. And firni an kulfi for desert. Kebab platter was a mixed experience.. they only offer chicken and lamb in kebab platter which was a little disappointing as we don't like lamb. They replaced all lamb kebabs with chicken.. so in a kebab platter you are getting only chicken kebab- no fish, no mutton. But I must say all preparations were very tasty and indeed healthy.. perfectly cooked and had an awesome smell of north Indian flavors.. The best experience which I had there was a complementary chocolate cake on the occasion of my birthday and it was just uuummmm... The cake was so yummmyy that I almost satisfy my hunger of kebab with the smoothness of. Chocolate... :) :)

Well a good experience, good if you are going with your family because the whole atmosphere is like that!

What was one of the most striking features of Peshawri was its decor, if not the food and the ambience created by the light music, the dimmed lights and the helpful assistance provided by the waiters. Peshawri - ITC Sonar gives you a glimpse of the traditions of Peshawar, one of them being the custom of using bare hands to eat the food. The food was, to say it simply, outstanding. The dal bukhara was one of the finest kinds of dal I've ever tasted. The naan and lachha parathas were soft and yet crispy. The chicken was not up to the dal's standard and was yet by far one of the most succulent and delicious I've ever tasted. If you come to Peshawri you shall not be disappointed. If you love food, you'll find yourself retracing your steps to visit the place again. Because at Peshawri, food is just one of the many little things which makes it an experience of a lifetime.

I absolutely love this place! Love their succulent kebabs, I love their Famous Dal Bukhara! I love their decor, their staff, their ambience, their drinks, desserts basically everything! 
Their kebabs are to die for! I usually have a set menu whenever I visit this place and basically have reserved this little gem for special occasions, like a New Year's Eve or a birthday party! I always order chicken Reshmi kebab which are super delicious, Dal Bukhara, Kulchas, Long Island iced teas and one time I even became a little ambitious and ordered a super expensive lobster which was amazing! I prefer to end the evening with their super delicious desserts like gulab jamun or the kulfi! 

If you don't try the North Indian cuisines out here you are missing out something HUGE!!

Food is bliss. Food is memories. Visit Peshawri for just not good food but an evening to remember. The tasteful decor and soothing music takes you to a different world altogether. The rose-water-soaked hand towels, the custom of eating with your fingers, the meetha pan at the end and other minute details add to the charm & authenticity. For starters we had a kebab platter. This had 4 pieces each of 5 types of chicken and lamb kebabs - sheekh, baara, murgh malai,  chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi. They were all soft, juicy and succulent. However the ones that definitely stood out were Murgh Malai and Sheekh. For main course we ordered dal bukhara and chicken khuchran to be had with lachcha parathas and butter naans. The dal was out of the world. The Chicken khuchran is a semi-dry gravy of shredded chicken on a onion-tomato base. It was good aswell but nothing extraordinary. The butter naan was an apt accompaniment. Soft yet crispy and buttery. The lachcha parathas were however, okayish. After this we didn't have room for desserts. I can vouch I will return to Peshawri for their amazing food, service and some more beautiful memories.

This place definitely lives up to its reputation. The ambience is really good. The waiters were really courteous & attentive.The legendary Daal Bukhara was yummy as usual. This being my 3rd visit I was comparing with the other times. And I was definitely not disappointed this time round.The kebabs were delicious. But one point to note is that their chicken reshmi kebab I found a bit dry. Their portions are huge & it was a struggle to finish everything. The cocktails & the mocktails - I am afraid I have forgotten the names were delicious too. It is expensive but you have to realise that this is in a 5* hotel hence it can charge the premium. Considering the portions given we did not find the price exorbitant. One happy customer indeed !!

Awesome just awesome place at ITC Sonar Bangla. The ambeince was great and primitive and innovative. One of the best thing is that they don't provide spoons and forms to eat, one has to eat with hands. The meat was wonderful, fresh, & nicely marinated with all the spices. Special mention for the humongous size gulab jamuns. They were huge and really tasty..
All in all top of the line place for the people who want to pamper their taste buds.

Great restaurant within ITC Sonar Bangla. An awesome place for Kebab lovers and the menu is limited. Took the non-veg kebab platter along with naan and a daal. Food was really good, but expensive. In the kebab platter they gave Tandoori Chicken, Reshmi Kebab, Malai Kebab, Sheekh Kebab and Mutton Bara Kebab. Liked the Bara Kebab and the Sheekh Kebab the most. Even the Reshmi Kebab was very different from the Reshmi Kebab elsewhere. The Tandoori Chicken was not the horribly looking red thing which are familiar of. The daal and the naan where also well prepared. Overall it was a nice experience.

Does food taste better when basic instincts are aroused?  Does meat taste more succulent to the Neanderthal man,  roasting it on fire in a wild surrounding, than to a human consuming it well-cooked?  Research in this domain might be a reality some day but I often get this thought when I visit theme based restaurants attempting to create an atmosphere of wilderness to invoke basic instincts of humans. Well,  Peshawri of ITC, is not exactly decked up to represent the jungle theme like another restaurant in Kolkata does but it's interiors are done up in a minimalistic sort of way, probably to represent the arid and wild landscapes of the NWFP of the Indian subcontinent. The tables and chairs appear to have been shaped by roughly hewn logs and there are mostly stools instead of back-supporting chairs. The use of beads for partition gives the impression of one having landed inside a Beduoin's lair. The food menu card is also in the shape of a wooden tablet, much like one would get to see in the cartoon series of "The Flintstones". Then there is that specific emphasis on the need to eat with one's bare hands while dining at Peshawri. 
Does all this decor improve the taste of food at Peshawri? Well,  the kebabs are soft and succulent but nothing out of the world stuff, considering the price that you pay for the same. The Sikandari raan though, which is the signature dish of this restaurant, is worth dying for.  The Daal Makhani too is excellent, just the way I like it, with less emphasis on the cream part.
The service standards needs to be improved, considering the fact that it is a premium restaurant.  I was quite disappointed with a mess up regarding my drinks order when I visited this Place last time. Overall too, the service is a trifle slow though that could be a deliberate attempt to whip up the gastronomic juices by letting the aroma of the kebabs waft in the air as one sits waiting for food.

A visit to this special place for the first time on my birthday, with 3 friends of mine. The decor really reminds of traditional Indian royalty while the absence of spoons for eating compels you to enjoy your food with your fingers. We had 2 Butter Naans each, with their famous Dal Bukhara, Malai Murgh and Peshawri Kebab, along with a Margarita and Martini. The Naans were buttered in such a way that you could smell the butter from a mile away. The Dal Bukhara was nice, nothing special. But the Murgh Malai was the hero of the day, amazing, just amazing. Sooooo soft, soooo tasty. The Peshawri Kebabs were made from lamb meat, and were tasty as well. The Margarita and Martini too were good. The amount of meat was ample and all this for just six and a half thousand. Will be definitely visiting again!!

Visited Peshawari today to celebrate a special occasion with my family. It was a bit crowded but the staff were courteous and attentive, though I thought they were a little short staffed.

The food was delectable to say the least. We started with a Jhinga Tandoori and Murgh Malai Kebabs. Both were well prepared and flavourful.¬†

For the Main Course we ordered Paneer Makhni, Dal Bukhara, Murgh Khurchan Laccha Parathas and Butter Naans. The Dal Bukhara did not disappoint. The Murgh Khurchan was delicious, so was the Paneer Makhni. The Butter Naan was soft but crispy but the Laccha Parathas seemed a bit dry.

All in all it was a delightful experience, topped with the complimentary Chocolate Mousse Cake which they presented to help celebrate our special occasion.

Went to peshawari long time back may b last year and I remember it was a public holiday so   we had made the bookings in advance. Writing this after long time as we were discussing about good mughlai restaurants in the city and it stuck me. There was no captain at the gate which was a surprise that to at the ITC and we had to find someone and ask them to guide us to our table. May b it is innovative but personally I didn't like the stool seats without a back rest . further the food was amazing specially the day Bukhara I must admit never had that kind of preparation till date it was something completely heavenly. We did not take any desserts. I liked the concept of using hands and no cutlery as I think Indian food is best enjoyed by hands. Only downside was service which was very poor which cannot b accepted from ITC.

We all have tasted Kebabs and yes we all LOVE kebabs or Mughlai food. No matter you visit any Mughlai food joint, the food tastes more or less the same.
If you really want ¬†to check how ITC makes a difference, then visit Peshawari. Btw, I must add that you will not find Mughlai food... This is Peshawari. There is a thin line of difference between the two.
If you are up for alcohol, then they have combos on the menu, where they recommend a suitable Kebab to go with a particular drink. Seriously, this is ITC.
My personal recommendation, a dish about which I recollect whenever I am hungry, is the Rann of Lamb. Stunning recipe. Shredded lamb leg roasted to perfection and covered with a delicious crust of Naan.¬†
If you are planning to spend some money for ITC this cuisine should be the first on your wish-list.

¬†¬† Coming to the food, I was sold when I tried their Daal Bhukara! I am amazed at how such a beautiful dish could be made out of something as simple as daal.¬† It smelt great and tasted even better. It was creamy, buttery and rich. In fact it is so rich that it will put Bill Gates to shame! The butter chicken was great too but daal bhukara is right up there. Sorry butter chicken, you have a lot of catching up to do!
¬†¬†¬† We ordered the huge naan (serves 6-8) for 5 of us. The experience of tearing pieces of the huge naan was fun. It was crispy around the edges and draggy towards the centre which was not to my liking. 
¬†¬† For starters we ordered the large Non Veg Platter. The platter came with 25-30 pcs. The chicken and mutton kababs were¬† succulent and juicy. The ones that make you smack your lips. ¬†
¬† The kulfi was creamy and one of the best ones I have had. A fitting end to what was a beautiful and high calorie experience.

The service was very good. The waiter was well informed and helped us in our menu selection.

I highly recommend this place. A great place to take your family out for a great dinning experience. Oh, and BTW one last thing! DAAL BHUKARA

The all Famous DAAL BUKHARA!!!! thats what this place all over India is famous for....¬†

but then all together the experience to visit peshawari is just awesome... they serve amazing food and then the service here is really great!

my only problem is the seating in this place as maximum seats dont have a back rest so sitting in this place for a long time can get difficult as we so faced... secondly i whenever i go here they keep telling me that they dont have the 750 ml bottle of sparkling water... i wonder why they never have it with them when maximum places around kolkata are giving the same...

now the tandoor platter and the daal bukahara combined with the naan bukhara which is a huge huge naan enough for 10 is our normal order... but this time i tried the raita... and i must say... being a yogurt fan... i was floored with what they serve... it is just awesome....

over and above the place is great but now a days the quantity of daal given is very low which is really sad...

Peshawri itc sonar is one of the places to go for if you want the legendary dal bukhara and also the place doesnt serve any gravy items apart from paneer which is gravy .
The place is to go for, if you want kebabs which they specialize in.

Food is brilliant , good tandoor kebabs of all sorts .

I went for the dal , veg. platter and the chicken kebab with roomali roti and kulcha .

The drinks menu is quite elaborate .
Ordered the classic mojito which was served in the tall glass .
Also the food here to be eaten with your fingers , they don't have any cutlery on the table like spoons and forks  . But if you ask them they might provide .

Bill after taxes came to Rs. 3000 per head .

If you are looking for gravy items you need to go to  dumpukt in Itc.

Peshawari at the ¬†ITC Sonar Bangla is the counterpart of the famed Bukhara ¬†...... it has a great number of similarities with it ... the low stools , open kitchen , no cutlery on the table and yes the famed chequered apron or ¬†"bib" as I prefer to call it.
The North - Western Frontier Cuisine they serve up is very good some of the finest in the city. actually. The degree of cooking and the balance of spices in each dish is perfect I have never had a bad meal here actually ! The popular picks are Raan Sikandari , Murgh Malai Kebab , Tandoori Jingha and Burrah Kebab are all excellent choices in the non-vegetarian section and naturally the famed Dal Bukhara ... simmered and cooked for 18 hours is not to be missed. In Kolkata I often visit with friends who are vegetarian hence I have had a chance to explore the vegetarian side of the menu as well. The Tandoori Paneer and Tandoori Aloo are absolutely top notch and pair perfectly with the Dal Bukhara.... however one particular favourite is truly missed ... the delicious "Palak Tamatar" that was featured on their menu earlier .... I sincerely hope that they will bring it back soon. If you have a sweet tooth and space left ( I usually never do) try the Phirni ... it ends the meal on a perfect note !

Went in with a lot of expectations but I was a bit disappointed. The place is undoubtedly expensive but the food was not really worth it. Seemed like just because it is situated at the basement of ITC Sonar, it is charging a fortune for pretty mediocre food.

Food: There are very less items. You order starters and ask for main course and they will give you a wooden plate with few items written on it, half of which are the very starters you ordered a moment back. My assorted tandoori platter was too sweet. I rate it 2.5/5.

Ambience: It has a semi Dhaba theme with bamboo poles, beads hanging everywhere, carpets on the wall and random utensils kept as showpieces. But I couldn't help noticing that the carpets and other wall hangings were rather too old and worn out, as if washed too many times. Maybe that was intensional but I expected things to shine around me. The hotel WiFi doesn't work because it is basement, and so doesn't your mobile network for the same reason. To top that there is absolutely NO MUSIC. I rate it 2.5/5

Service: This is something I cannot complain about. The waiters are always on their toes to serve you. You are confused about how to make space for the big bowl in your hands and you will see another hand immediately reaching for the used plates and removing them to solve your problem. There is atleast one person constantly watching your table. I rate it 4.0/5.

Overall I would say, if I did not know it is situated in ITC Sonar and the rates weren't so high, maybe I wouldn't have been so dissappointed. But being a prominent brand, I think it should be much better.

Had been to Peshawri for my birthday dinner. Lovely ambience and lovely food. The servers were attentive and courteous. A bit on the pricier side, but then again its ITC and you cannot expect less. Since it was months back I don't exactly remember the names of the dishes. We had ordered kebabs (fish) as starters , tasted really good, soft juicy and succulent, just the way i love it; and beer for drinks. For main course we got a chicken dish and two butter naan breads. We were two but couldn't finish the mains, quantity was impressive. The naan was soft and the chicken gravy was thick, spicy...absolutely yummy! I also got a birthday cake on the house, which was chocolatey, creamy and gooey, completely made my day. :D
Nice place to relax only if you're not worried about the pocket pinch! 
would love to visit again for the food, the ambience, and the fine classy dining experience.

Last night I had a meal at Peshwari perheps for my fourth or fifth time. It is really expensive. But it is really good as well. We went for the Tandoori Jhinga and Sikandri Raanlast night but more on that later.
Firstly I did reserve a table as the IPL teams were supposed to be staying at ITC Sonar as a result of which getting seated was no problem at all. We were welcomed in very warmly by the staff, although in my opinion the quality of service has deteriorated somewhat since the last few years and the communication skills especially so. The warmth though is intact. As is usual we were offered a cool towel each which was rather refreshing. I feel a pang of disappointment every time when they remove the beautiful copper plates with Peshawri embossed on them. And those huge bibs, for some strange reason I really love wearing them although they are not really required.
To complement our Tandoori Jhinga and Sikandri Raan we ordered the Naan Peshawri, after a long long time. I also ordered a bottle of the Beaujolais Henry Fessy which was a medium bodied fruity red and went really well with the raan. The only mistake I made was ordering the huge naan which we really struggled to finish. Unfortunately like my previous experience the more it stayed the harder and more difficult it became to tear. For desserts my fellow diners went for a kulfi and a phirni which they immensely enjoyed. The server was gracious and extremely polite. The manager too paid us a courteous visit to inquire if everything was in order. The food and service was very good as usual.
The only request I have Peshwari chefs is that please do something such that the naan remain tender and buttery for as long as it remains on the table. I love it when the edges are crispy when the naan is nice and hot but as it keeps getting colder it gets difficult to tear and chew. So please do something about this. Please. If not for the naan I would have given a 4.5 or 5 out of 5.

This review is from a meal partaken quite some time ago. Impressed with the nice interiors, but the food did not quite do justice.

5-6 six of us had visited. We ate various items but what comes to mind was the following:

The chicken in butter masala was not what we expected. Very tomatoey and rather sweet.

My father had ordered a prawn kabab. On being asked by the steward how it was, his succinct response summed it up. He said that it tasted great, but how could he be sure it was prawn? The meat had been mashed so much it had lost all texture!

The parathas were awful. They tasted like they had been made from preserved frozen stock, which I would not be surprised since ITC does dabble in that field.

We went to Peshawari on this New Year's eve - the consequence was that the menu was a fixed one, which is fine.

The menu consisted of kebabs (mutton sheek kebabs, chicken and prawn) and all of them were very tasty. The main course consisted of Naans (which were quite soft), Sikandari Raan and Bara Kabab, both of which were also quite tasty too. The dal Bukhara was also very nice. The pineapple raita could have been better. I had already had so much of meat that I couldn't reach the dessert! I let them pass, satisfying myself with a meetha pan which was complementary.

The staff was very courteous and helpful - excellently trained.

The one disadvantage of the place is that 90% of the seats are basically stools with no backrest. While I suppose that is done to create an ambience, it gets rather uncomfortable after a while.

To watch out for: Being a theme restaurant, cutlery is not offered to you - you have to eat with your hands mandatorily.

Everytime I visit this place, my love for it increased to further depth, The class and the Quality they have embedded in their servings and staffs is really magnificent.

The entrance along with the marvellous reception which i get from the managers is really heart warming. The Ambience of the place is really Rich and suits the taste of Upper Class segments.¬†

The Menu is concise with some amazing delicacies worth cherishing and keeps you coming Back.

My fixed Menu for the place with companions is:

The Naan
Dal Maharani
Kadai Rogan Paneer
Shahi Kofta¬†

Drinks on the Side and good classy music with Paan in the end.
Its worth good money as well as its a Prime Destination in ITC Sonar But no way comparable to any class competitors, as it outshines the rest.

We were 20 people bill was around 35k. 
See, the food was good but then you get the same food at Zaranj at third of the cost, so why spend more.
I had:
Vegetable Platter- 3000!- very good anyway quantity enough for 5
Dal and Paneer- okay
Roti-Family Nan was the best

I had the sikandari raan as recommended by many and it was plainly awful. It was bland with no spices and seemed just like having steamed meat. At almost 2500 with the tax that's a little steep for just steamed meat. The raan at dum pakt is way better. 

The service is great but it's uselessly expensive. If someone wants to have similar cuisine  in a great ambience then they should try Zaaranj .

I visited the place once and was really very impressed. The ambience was really great. I went for the set menu at lunch. It was really awesome. In that menu 3-4 kinds of kababs were included and all of those were equally awesome. After two servings I was almost full but still went for the main course, the biriyani was very good and mixed Raita was also very tasty. However the price is on the much higher side as you expect in the ITC hotels!

Authentic North Indian Moghlai cuisines are served here for a decent price in an exclusive hotel like ITC Sonar.

ITC Sonar is located opposite Science City on the fringe of EM Bypass, about 3 km from the main City, Park Circus is the nearest spot from the old Calcutta.

There are a few restaurants at this 5 Star Hotel.

Various dishes are in the menu and I have tried many of those.  I was fully satisfied for the quality of cooking and nice decor, friendly servers, great ambiance.  Cost for food is naturally little higher side as this is being a 5 Star Hotel.

I would like to rate it 4 out of 5

Celebrated my birthday this year at Peshawri. As far as the food and services by the restaurant is concerned, it was good. Had made a prior reservation at Peshawri.  Although they should add some more items to their menu, which would add to their USP.

My experience was spoilt by the inefficiency of the hotel. As mentioned I had made a prior reservation and wasn't informed that there would be a cover charge of Rs. 500/- per person at the gate. Didn't mind paying it and it was adjusted in the bill, but at least the hotel should have had the decency of informing me over the phone about the same when a reservation was made.

It was kind of a spoiler to what could have been a wonderful evening.

I'll start with the good bit, the food is very good and very heavy in the gOod way, the dal bukhara is a all time favorite, both the veg n non-veg platter are excellent specially the sheak kabab, and for dessert i have tried 3 things and all 3 are extremely good - gulab jamun, phirni & rasmalai.

Also for the foodies and for the ones who look at the menu and want to have it all should go for their set menu its a nice option as they serve everything one would wana have. 

Now the BAD PART - their service is poor or rather BAD, the staff are not polite at all, one problem i have always faced is they are always stingy when it comes to the discount part. My dad is a member with the itc culinary plus, but i being his son is not entitled to used his card. My friend uses her parents FHRI card and even she was denied discount bcos her parents went dining with her. 

Being a regular at Taj im not used to such rude behavior in a 5 star. No other 5 star in town has such bad behavior. These people seem to be taking pain in running the show and the brand has expansions in the pipeline. 

IF YOU WANA VISIT FOR THE FOOD, U SHOULD BUT NOT FOR AN EXPERIENCE FOR SURE. DISAPPOINTING 

4.5 for the food and 1 for the service.

If I try to recollect the experience at Peshawari, the first thing that comes to my mind is the Dal Bukhara. Ohhhh what a wonderful Dal they prepare. Only for this, I can go to Peshwari. The Biryani is also pretty authentic. The spread is also excellent. I wish the price would have been reduced to accommodate a lot many foodies who are deprived every day to taste the wonder of Indian Food. Needless to say, the ambiance is too good.

This was my second trip to an ITC mughlai restaurant. Last year lunch at Bukhara in Delhi. This year in Kolkata I found myself craving for Bukhara food again. Little did I know that the Bukhara franchise is found around the country as Peshawari restaurants in the five star hotels. It is undisputedly one of the finest north west frontier cuisines in the country and a must try for all.. the dal is out of the world i would recomend it to all.
overall would rate it as a perfect 5!

the brilliant dining experience from the house of itc.. the birth place of dal bulhara.. with a limited menu and wonderful north indian food.. its a must try for all the northindian food maniacs and the decor will get back to you in the early 19th century.. maharaja style with modern layout ! . However, every individual dish they offer is an art in itself. you would see a lot of foreigners loving our food there.. its a must try ! 
overall would rate it as 5!

You will not be let down. Peshawari surely has one of the best "north indian" offerings in Kolkata. Its quite (un)popular for it's limited menu options, but you can be assured that whatever is there, is really very good.

They encourage you to eat by hand and provide cutlery only on request. As a rule, they do not serve rice in any form as they say it does not go with their menu. Service is top notch and proper care is taken to serve food at the right temperatures. Everything else which you expect from a quality 5 star eatery is there.

The Dal Makhani is truly "makhani" and is a real delight and goes really well with the rest of the menu. Its taste lingers on well past your meal. The Pudina Lachha Paratha is a must try. Often people avoid the subzis and get the Roti and Dal served along with the kababs, and thats where Peshawari stands out - for this uniqueness which you will not experience elsewhere. The Kababs could be better but when had with the Dal and Rotis, tastes perfect. Desserts are the typical indian type and are all very good.

The Unsung Heroes - Raita, Palak Tamatar Sabzi and Firni for dessert.

The prices are sure to burn a hole in your pocket with an average meal for 2 costing upwards of Rs 2500.

To sum up, Peshawari is not a place I will visit every weekend as the food is quite rich and heavy. But once in a while, it surely is a great option. Even with its limited menu, it continues to delight.

A feel of royalty surrounds you when u enter this chique resturant in the heart of kolkata. The turban wearing waiters with the cutlery is of the royal design. The sitting, at times is a bit uncomfortable with the wooden finish but you tend to forget that with the aura of the royal feel. The food is delicious. The Lamb kebab is a must. I have never had such soft kebabs where each and every bite just fills your taste buds to its maximity. The down to eath feel is maintanined with the olden style of having with your hands rather than sponns. The Dal Makhani and the Masala kulcha is par exelence.
Though stiff to the pocket for budget diners, this is a must for a special occasion like an anniversary or birthday.

The fine-dining restaurant with the most succulent kebabs in the city. There's a sense of royal elegance radiating from the walls thanks to its chic yet grand dcor. You cant help but feel it when you walk in. The food, in a word, is divine. The Sikandari Raan, Bara Kebab and Tandoori Jhinga are so succulent each bite is guaranteed to transport you to gastronomic heaven. The soft and fluffy naans must be had with the oh-so creamy Daal Makhani. The bar, with its exotic offering of cocktails and the live music ensure that dining here is an unforgettable experience.

You know what to expect when you enter a Peshawari;
Ton-notch service, an exquisite ambiance and gastronomic paradise. 
SO before writing the review lets just award the stars:
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Dinner for 2 with drinks: 4K approx.

Food:
The menu is extremely limited. Everything is dry except for the daal. However, everything individual dish they offer is an art in itself. So, the last time I visited this place was when I was hosting a few business guests from the US. These gentlemen had a couple of days in India and wanted to taste Indian food. I couldn't think of a better place than Peshawari to show off the delights of North indian food. 

We start off with an assorted Veg. Kebab Platter (2100Rs). So this has approx 2-3 pieces of ALL their veg starter: Panner,  aloo, gobi & stuffed capsicum. We also call for their signature dish-- the Dal Bukhara (700Rs ). It is an absolute delight. They say that this daal is made from a secret recipe which involves the daal simmering over a low flame for an entire night. phew. :) (you can pretty much feel your arteries hardening whilst enjoying this heavy, buttery delight...ah well! a small price to pay for the pleasure it offers your taste buds)
  
We call for pundina paratha (absolutely yummy!), Garlic naan (pretty good), Rumali Roti (Nothing special) and a type of Paneer kulcha (nicee!). (Breads cost approx 200 each)
For drinks we had a lemon iced tea (superb- they seem to have used a good quality Orthodox leaf tea), a jaljeera and a couple of fresh lime sodas. (however, do note, that they have a great selection of beers from around the globe, apart from the usual wines and spirits).

They have Indian desserts only. However we were too full to give them a try.

NOTE: You have to use your hands, since they refrain from giving out cutlery to the guests! They say it helps you connect better with the food. Well, who am I to complain? :p

Service:
Top Notch. They were quick. When we asked for all our breads to be cut into 4 pieces (so all 4 of us could taste :p ), they did so without us having to explain it to them twice. They had excellent knowledge of the menu and were advising nicely. You are never hurried (but then, thats expected when you are at a premium place like this).

Ambiance:
Some people may find the seating a bit uncomfortable as there is no back rest. Also the tables are lower than one usually sits at in other restaurants. The dim lightning and open kitchen give the restaurant a warm feeling. 
While you exit after a heavy meal, a paan platter awaits you. :)

All in all, a wonderful place...very heavy on the pocket, but the food gives justice for the price it commands. 

Cheers!!
