Lavishly decorated.
Good interiors.
Awesome Chinese,lipsmacking i must say.
Prices are good.
Only problem,their Waiters.
No captain came up.What we ordered,we got a different food.Same happened with two other tables too.though the quality of the food made it.
Please improve the service.not at all satisfactory.but food is really good here.
Specially the starters.

Beautiful Chinese food available. Try the Prawn crackers here to relish your tongue with an exotic taste. The vintage Chinese ambience of the restaurant just by New Town, the place provides authentic Chinese cuisine. The Oriental feeling and warm service will make sure that you leave with a joyous tummy and a satisfied mind.

A nice family restaurant with a good ambiance. Located just opposite Arsalan in Chinar Park. Simple decor but nice. Prices are pocket friendly and the food is really good. We had mixed friedrice, kungpao chicken and soup and it did not disappoint us. The food takes a little long to arrive though and we had we sit for good 45 mins for the food to arrive.

Went there on a weekday afternoon, the tables were quite empty given the time. We were a group of 6 and ordered in Tom Yum Soup, Clear Soup and Meat ball soup along with starters Crispy Chiken and Crispy Babycorn. After which we went for mixed hakka noddles, mixed rice, and mafon noodles with Chicken Chilly Garlic and Chicken Sweet and Sour as sides. Honestly didn't expect much since this was my first visit and given from my place this is quite far from the main city, but the food was superb, loved every bit. Chicken was well salted inside, the sweet and sour and yum and that one spicy sauce they keep on the table, that was so beautifully spicy! Loved it. And the price just around 2000 INR which is quite a steal if you ask me given the quality, quantity, and taste.

The restaurant is on the main road so it's very easy to locate. Great Chinese food at pretty decent prices.the ambiance of the restaurant is a hard 2.There isn't a lot of effort put into it to give it a Chinese feel, minimum work is done.
The food quality is spot on, if you're in Kolkata,near airport,for a quick bite it's great.
The staff is really inadequate, though the restaurant wasn't even 50% full they were really late with food, quite clumsy with serving, inattentive and distracted.

Ordered ----------- Chicken Spring Roll


The PROS :- Situated on the Main Road near Spencers- Chinar Park branch which was quite easy to locate, Food quantity was good & the Spring Rolls had the Perfect Crisp. I also like the sweet sauce which was served alongside. Staff's behaviour was good. Deƒáor was based on Chinese Culture theme. Good for those who love Peace loving environment.



The CONS :- Didn't like the filling at all. No signs of Chicken pieces. It was tasting like more of a Veg Spring Roll. Cost was a little on a higher side. Waiting time 20 mins. approx.

We had ordered mixed hakka noodles where we could barely find prawns.Hardly there were 4-5 prawns.And the taste was not upto the mark.Schezuan chicken also was not that good.I would recommend to raise the standard of food,else the rating wont be good.
Hope to visit a better shinryu next timeüòä

# Good ambience
# Well behaved staff
# Excellent food quality
# Quantity very good
# Alcohol served
# Cocktail Mocktail served
# Cost of items moderate
# Food card accepted

Today we had the Chicken 65, which was really good. It is Shinryu speciality. We also had the American Chopsuey which was just awesome!
Devil chicken was spicy and tasty.
Last time we had the Chicken Mushroom soup and Schezwan fried rice which was superbb.
Moreover for the IT guys it is good where food card is accepted.
Must try out restaurant which wont burn a hole in your pocket.

Located just beside the Spencer's shopping complex near the chinar park crossing.
It's a family restaurant and bar. And the staff mostly guide you to tables and it's not something that you get to choose. That's pretty disappointing.
The decor is somewhat subtle, service prompt, and food is served in ample proportions.We ordered their hot and sour soup, chilli garlic noodles,schezwan noodles,chicken in oyster sauce, chicken 65. Tasted about average.
Their caramel Custard is a must try.

Went there on a team get-together and had Phad thai Noodles and Shinryu chicken, the food was served hot, one of the primarily important factor of Chinese food, the taste was good, but the flavour was missing, may be they can work on it a bit more.

Had lunch today. On the main rajarhaat road just near to Chinarpark more and opposite to two renowned restaurant Arsalan & Aminia. While we wanted to enter saw a'Closed' board on the entrance. It was 12:15pm and thought it may be yet to open. But one service staff told it's open, not at all professional attitude. Ambiance is average not very good. We ordered one starter 'Threaded Chicken' and in main course 'mix hakka noodles', 'mix chili-Garlic fried rice', 'Thai sweet chili fish' and 'Chef special chicken with chili bean sauce'. There are very limited staffs but we got our food within 15-30mins, considering we ordered uncommon items it is quite acceptable. I must say all the items we ordered are of excellent taste and flavor with nice quantity. Overall I'll definitely try to have food there again in future. My suggestion will be to have more staffs and to have some publicity otherwise it'll be be tough for them to compete with Arsalan/Aminia.

Visited this restaurant with my family on 21 Oct 16 and ordered Chimney Soup, Chinese Chopsuey, Schezwan Hakka Noodles and Darshan with ice-cream. Enjoyed the food thoroughly. The Chopsuey and Hakka noodles had a wonderful smoky taste.

The Chimney Soup did not have any fire burning inside the chimney and therefore serving it in the chimney was pointless and only made serving the soup in individual bowls difficult. If fire is not used in the chimney, IMHO it would be better to serve the soup in a large bowl.

The ambience of this restaurant and quality of service are good.

This restaurant was good at times before. Related to my last 2 visit here changed my view.  First time they took 1.5 hrs for home delivery and though wrong order packed for me. And later on I visited 2 times and their food quality degraded a lot. Most remarkable change is with their behaviour and not at all customers friendly and it seems they are favouring us to provide a sit to eat their poor quality food at good prices.. If this kind of attitude continued at least I may refrain from coming here again.

Don't go by the cover..!! we chose this place on a day we were finding solace in Chinese food. It was the nearest and looked alright!

Ambience- good even if it much big the passageway between tables are not very spacious. Otherwise its alright. 

Service- very good. The waiters are kind and willing to please you. That's what I loved the most about the place.

Food- Chinese is their specialty but I hate to admit it's just an air-bubble. We ordered a lot of food. Whenever I go for Chinese I love to order the crispy fried babycorns but here they didn't taste anything close to the expectations I had. The noodles were ok. So was the chicken starters.

I visited this place several times. And I like this place very much.Chinese lovers must visit.pocket friendly and tasty food.and the dim lights ;and the Chinese decorations is must to give you a pleasant evening..the owner;a lady  herself monitors and is very well behaved.only thing I dont like is ..not all items of the menu card will be available.and every time i ask for a chikn/veg rice or noodle or chopsey they alwatz end up serving the mixed one!!!but worth a visit.

This is my first tym at Shinryu. Went there with my mum and dad for dinner. Interior is okay. The staff are is cordial. We ordered chicken 65, chicken Hakka chowmein and vegetable and chicken in oyster sauce. The chicken 65 was really good. Vegetable and chicken in oyster sauce was good. If you are doing there, do take a look at the do's and dont's in their menu card...

Its been quite a long time i visited this place for a parcel when it was newly opened. Located at very near to Chinar Park Crossing, now opposite to Aminia, chinar park. They deal in authentic and indian Chinese and thai dishes. The place is quite big in size and shape with the decors are nice and attractive. As it was newly build up then so without experimenting i had the orders of Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken. The order took 20 mins to arrive. The taste was pretty decent and chilly gravy was quite spicy too.. But with the current reviews it making me curious to visit there again. Prices are a bit factor too.

Even after taking 30 minutes to serve, the outside layer of all the momos were very thick and it was seriously raw, not cooked properly. Having stomach ache after having those. Beware.

This place restaurant is located opposite to Chinar Park Arsalan.. The food is horrible... They served cold food and the taste is so bad that you just can't have the food.. People won't understand that it is so bad.. We have ordered lung fung soup which was served cold and I don't know maybe they served stale mushrooms or not but I could nt have it completely. Then we ordered drums of heaven.. It was dry and I think the dish was stale. They were just microwaving they prepared food and was serving. Then we ordered noodles rice chicken and fish. The amount they served my very less. So we cancelled every order..the service was also not good. The waiters couldn't even serve properly.. They were not trained.. So please don't even think of going to this place for lunch..

This place makes up for the lack of a decent bar-cum-restaurant around the airport area- well..sort of!
For above average Chinese and overpriced beer and over courteous waiters, the bill that reaches you is just about reasonable. We've dropped in here a couple of times to laze around after work on Friday nights that we hope to slowly transcend into a lazier Saturday. 
Ambience-wise a 2/5. They could've revved up their interiors a bit. I cannot exactly point out what is lacking but you can feel they could've done better.
Now the food part. You get very good chicken  based starters- try their dragon chicken(which is laden with peanuts), chicken 65 or shinryu chicken to wash down with a mug of beer. 
For mains we had tried rice and Chinese chopsuey on two different occasions. The Chinese chopsuey is very good- pan fried noodles with soy based gravy comprising of chicken mushrooms and vegetables topped with a fried egg. However the fried rice was oily. So we steered clear of it on our subsequent visits.
Overall a decent place in the rajarhat area.

Well just opposite to aminia in chinar park, you will find this restaurant. It is a Chinese owned place. The staff are courteous and friendly ready to help you... we ordered chicken fried rice, lamb, devil's chicken. The rice was good with more amount of shredded chicken. The lamb was delicious and it was perfectly cooked. Though the meat was shredded, it should have been in peices. But the devil's chicken was not that spicy as it had to be. But it was good. It's a decent space.

I Must say, Am not much of a paneer in a Chinese¬† restaurant person but the Threaded paneer has definitely piqued my palette. The taste was amazing even after a home delivery (We've always done that from shinryu).. Loved their¬† 'Shinryu mixed Special noodles' & the 'Hakka chili lamb'..They've got their flavors right and spice was definitely good(I had a hot tomali craving of sorts ). Its been a good place witha¬† fair amount of consistency in their dishes as my wife has actually never gone past the threaded paneer and i do get to taste every time :).

Used to go there ages ago; back when things were going upward for this joint. Now a complete disaster, my rating also considers the Shinryu of old (sometime around 2012-14). Stopped going there after a case of food poisoning that happened about a year ago.
So, for the ratings,
Food: then 8/10, now 4/10
Ambiance: 7/10 for both
Service: 7/10
Pricing: 6/10
That being said, my rating does not reflect my outlook towards this restaurant.

Your restaurant was highly recommended by master Payne ex teacher of St. Mary 's 0rphange&Day School dum dum & so we did a take-away. We paid a bill of rs.387 for 3 plates chicken hakka chow + an additional sum of 30 bucks was slammed on us for egg. Low&behold to our utter dismay apart from small lousy chicken pieces which you literally had to search for --the 3 eggs that we were charged for seemed like ONLY ONE SINGLE EGG was used. We have been dining in several places like JIMMYS KITCHEN, MAHARAJA BAR &REST. TUNG FONG TO name a few...I wonder if there's a DIFFERENCE in quality n quantity of the food being served at the table and take away ??? I'm adding a picture of the so called egg chicken noodles for your kind perusal.

The first thing that you notice about the restaurant is very little care for customers. What even is worse that the owner of the restaurant is very blunt in her approach. I think one big problem they have is not enough people to attend to customers, and hence they keep on failing on customer service. The food however is good which made me go there twice. My advice to you'll is unless you're running out of options, its not the right place to visit.

We generally review any restaurant to speak about food or the ambiance but today I would like to highlight the kind of negative hospitality in this so called authentic Chinese restaurant. The behaviour of the staffs especially the waiter and the small lady at the bar counter was just horrible. Two of us visited the restaurant at a time when 40% of the seats were empty and to be more comfortable we decided to take a four seater table instead of the only one available 2 seater table which was very uncomfortable. The small Chinese/northeastern lady came up asking us to take the 2 seater table and when we said that we would be more comfortable on the 4 seater she straightaway told us that we can not take the 4 seater and gestured that we can leave if we are not willing to seat on a 2 seater which is not at all acceptable when there is so ample of empty space in the restaurant. She continued stating that they are full house and her gestures were of an uncivilized human being without any decency and I do not know whether she is at all trained to serve even in a cheap roadside roll stall also or not. The waiter with glasses wearing a tie was also very rude and put the baggage of my wife on the floor even after knowing that the same belonged to one of the guest. These ill mannered people should go to some other restaurant to learn how to behave with the guests and then come to work. Lastly we left without having anything and felt utterly disappointed and disgusted with the whole episode and the staffs were completely indifferent and did not even bother to apologize. In one word, staffs of SHINRYU are HORRIBLY PATHETIC.

We dropped in last evening for dinner. It was a very bad experience. The ambience was poor, the food poorer. We started with wonton soup where the dumplings smelt of flour. The Malaysian potatoes and baby corn reeked with garlic and soy sauce. The Singapore noodles and chicken fried rice were also not up to the mark. Only the chicken and fish dishes were a bit better. Overall a great let down!

The most pathetic resturant I have ever visited. Staffs are not well mannered at all , I went on eve of holi and it was a total mess. Food taste was very ordinary nothing authentic cant evn compare wid a some small street side cafe. Chicken Tomyum soup we could only find soup and no chicken at all I never had such pathetic sezwan mixed rice neither kungpao chicken where we can see only peanuts , atleast strater dragon chicken was still ok. All these costed me rs. 881 . I will never ever visit such a resturant and will suggest if you dont want to ruin you valid time stay out of this. Any resturant in tangra the most ordinary one is better than these , I dont even dare to compare this wid mainland/barbq or even haka.
I wanted to give -1 but minimun rating is 1.

Shinryu is really an authentic place to have chinese food as the owner and the restaurant manager were chinese if not from sikkim or north east. Whatever they are, in terms of preparation of food, presenting them, garnishment of food and overall the decoration of the place is really impeccable. With those buddhist "‡¶ú‡¶™‡ßç-‡¶Ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞" hanging from the entry, it really adds a typical feel good value. I went there this evening with my wife and kid and found the place to be not too crowded. Like the other expert foodie has mentioned, there is still a section which is not opened for people.
We ordered for Shinryu special chicken and salt n pepper fish with a Heineken for me and a blue lagoon for her. And the first bite I took, it truly reminded me of china town restaurants. In terms of quantity, definitely the price is acceptable. They don't have any dedicated smoking zone and no dedicated parking area, both these tasks you have to take on your own - no risk and at your own risk respectively.. üòÄüòÄ
Service was good, however, few staffs were over courteous that before my beer glass was empty, they started to pour in from the bottle - Not required buddy!!
Overall definitely in terms of food quality, quantity, interior, staff behavior - I would recommend this place for all.

The waiters didn't know what food they were serving. DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!

If you want to have a fine dining experience then this is not the place. It is better you order food from a modest Chinese eatery and dine in your home. Will save a lot of time and bucks. I came with my girlfriend on Christmas eve after a fight...hoping to have a good time but ended up wasting my 1400 bucks and angering her more. Firstly we came at 10 pm and they close at 10:45 pm , as a result the waiter was asking to order at a single go. I mean, why would you do that when your closing time is 45 minutes later...that means either you are lazy or you don't care about your customer. Waited for the food... food was horrible.. we ordered ¬†one fortune fish starter....and my girlfriend puked...the fish had that horrible stench when you go out in a fish market. The devil chicken which we ordered was tasteless and ¬†was not at¬†all 'spicy' as claimed by them. The Shinryu special noodles was nothing special , it was like a normal gravy chowmein. Any modest or low end Chinese eatery¬† could cook better. Moreover the staff was reticent and less courteous. Seems like they were in a hurry,¬†But in that case u should have given the closing time 10 pm not 10:45. Overall it was a below average experience.¬†Not fit for dining with your family or ur beloved. Good if you only want to drink and have some normal starters along with it. But wait Chinese restaurant and bar...??? Isn't Tangra¬† a better option ?? ;)

I have been to this restaurant several times. In the initial days I enjoyed the food, the service and the warmth and hospitality. But last month in october when I visited the place after a long time, I found its completely changed. The concierge didn't know what to say and how to say it. After attaining a seat I waited for 15 mins to get a waiter and that also after approaching them personally. I asked for a food suggestion which the waiter was totally confused about. Eventually 70% of the dishes were not available. I ordered 3 dishes. 1 for starter and 2 for main course. We got served only 2. The 3rd dish didn't arrive until our dinner was all done. Even one chair was completely wet with water which I didn't even notice until my trouser was all wet. It was a horrible experience and I am not going there ever in my life.

Previously I have ordered Home Delivery and was quite satisfied with their food.

Today is the first time that I visited the place in person with few of my colleagues.
Stepping inside the restaurant one will have a feeling that though there was effort given to create an ambiance and the Chinese theme but there is lack of maintenance presently. Liked the Aquarium placed near the entrance.

The staffs are OK.¬†

The best thing about them is their food and the reasonable price.

We ordered Crispy Chilli Garlic Chicken (8 pieces) - it was really awesome in taste and Dragon Chicken for starters. The Dragon chicken was spicy but we were looking for something spicy and really liked the dish.

In main course we ordered Mixed meat Fried Rice and Fish with Vegetables (though this item is not in their Menu but still they serve this and you can definitely try it - They have instead Chicken with Vegetables in their Menu).

The fried rice had too many carrots, otherwise the food is really good. I would have rated them 3.5 (3.9 actually but no way to specify that) only if they had a well maintained interior and decor but if it was only for food it would have been definitely a 4.0 rating.

I had a horrible experience yesterday dining here. We found that Crispy Chilli Garlic Chicken was smelling like rotten and asked for replacement. Dry Chilli Chicken was served which had the same rotten smell. It seems that somehow the chicken items served to us had started to rot. Anyways we are lucky not having suffered any health issues. Other items like Chicken Manchow Soup , Mixed Fried Rice , Mixed Hakka Chowmein seemed fine. Anyways we reported the incident at the cash counter.

The restaurant is located next to chinark park traffic light.I would not say the location is perfect as to reach the place you have to walk in the muddy road.The USP of the restaurant is this is family restaurant in that area their is scarcity of good restaurant.They have 19 rules to run the restaurant which they follow religiously.The staff is very decent and ambience is ok not that great.Now lets talk about food. I had dry veg Manchurian, veg momo's and spring roll.The taste was average for all of them nothing great about it . Veg Manchurian was below the mark and looked burned. I request the restaurant to work out on dish taste and presentation.There is a long way to go for them to reach to 4.5 or above rating.

Ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Chefs Spl Chicken(Chilli oyster).. Rice was good, chicken was very good but very salty...probably a bit too much of the oyster sauce. They have also started a non veg buffet recently @ 199.. Didn't try it but there's only one non veg item in the entire assortment. Feels more like a gimmick to pull in guests from Aminia on the other side of the road... Than a serious attempt to serve quality food at reasonable prices to guests.

Seldom has a restaurant and it's food evoked such a fond nostalgia of childhood as such as this restaurant in such an unlikely place. It's the epitome of Kolkata Chinese cuisine of our childhood, the food epitomised by Beijing and such Tangra places. The rice noodles is just right -soft and delicately flavoured. The squid in sweet garlic sauce is not only delicious, of just the right succulence and generous in quantity. The chicken and vegetables in white sauce was so sublime that hardly a morsel passed through my cheeks that did not engender a burning desire to go hug the chef. The ambience is lovely, the staff warm and friendly and the owner wonderfully interactive.  A fantastic place.

I want to give it a '4 star' rating but a single dish that day spoilt the entire experience. I had ordered for 'Lemon Chicken'. It was so sweet I was barely able to have a second piece. It was as if I was having chicken dipped in a curry of cotton candies. Apart from this, the ambience and service was quite good.

It was 15th of August and I along with my friends had visited this restaurant in the evening located close to City Centre II, Rajarhat New Town. Since it was the Independence Day, it was notified outside the restaurant that the day was a dry day. 

The ambiance was good,decently decorated, sort of a homely environment with the servicemen being quite courteous.

We ordered 2 Chicken Singapore Noodles, Chicken Szechwan Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken. The food was served hot within 10-15 minutes and each plate of noodles and rice were enough for a single person. Compared to Chicken Singapore noodles, the Chicken Szechwan Fried Rice was a bit more hot and spicy but definitely delicious. Also, here the Szechwan Chicken had finite number of chicken pieces instead of the usual shredded pieces that one generally receive while having Szechwan Chicken. Having said that, the dish no doubt tasted really good especially the gravy. We finished having the gravy first than the chicken. 

In totality, its definitely a place to have quality Chinese food within an affordable price range in and around Rajarhat New Town, Kolkata.

A homely restaurant with comforting, home style food. I had a fairly satisfying lunch here a few days back. My thoughts:

- the sweet fresh lime soda was not sweet or limey enough and hence not as refreshing as I would have liked it
- the cheese parcels came stuffed to the gills with crumbled cheese. The jacket was thin and light. But overall, a tad low on seasoning. It came accompanied with a nice little sweet and sour dipping sauce.¬†
- American chopsuey did not let us down. Loads of crisp, crunch and sauce, though the sauce should have been punchier.

Shinryu was far from disappointing. They would go far if they stepped up their game just one notch.

I have been visiting this place from the day it opened. Service is poor. Ambience could be much better.  The only savior is there food which has improved over time.  The entry to the restaurant is really dirty coz of road construction taking place for over a year now. You should be aware that food will taste good only when one of the gentleman who is owner of the hotel is running the kitchen. On his days off the food standard falls down like crazy.  They have untrained waiters. To sum it up, this is a place where you can go with your friends or colleagues to hv sm drinks and food. Not recommended for family or romantic eat outs.

Went to this restaurant to celebrate birthday of a colleague. This place was recommended by another foodie colleague of mine. She told this place serves the best Chinese cuisines in that area! Well... Yeah! It was good.. few dishes can be even termed as very good but not "the best".¬†
I found the interior a bit dark. We went for lunch, on a bright sunny afternoon, still it was a bit gloomy. Has a fish aquarium near the entrance, a bar to the front and well organised tables on left and right side.¬†
The service was a bit late. We already made the order from office as we had to rush back to office after lunch, still they took almost 30 mins to serve (we ordered almost 10 mins before arriving).¬†
Now the food, the fried rice was really nice. Ample quantities of chicken, egg and prawns scattered throughout the fried rice. Nice flavor of garlic and onion to tempt our taste buds. The hot garlic chicken was decent. Strong flavor of garlic, not overshadowed by the hotness of chilly! Splendid! The chicken in black bean sauce was also satisfactory. But the prawn dish- prawn munchurian was not good at all. It was as sweet as honey!!! A bit disappointing.¬†

Overall, a pleasant and likable experience. Good place to have a pocket friendly lunch or dinner along with some drinks.

Shinryu is located right opposite to aminia. Looked like a quintessential Chinese restaurant. This place is just about okay.

Ambiance:
There's something missing in this place. You enter and a gigantic aquarium welcomes you. The ambiance is nothing great as such.

Food:
The chicken drumsticks are a tad bit sweet but they don't lack in taste. However the pieces are tiny. 

The kung pao chicken is with gravy and is very spicy. The hot garlic chicken was palatable. The only problem was the the size of the pieces of chicken are weirdly tiny. 

Their Hakka noodles are tasteful. The portion is huge!

Service:
Had to wait for a long time until somebody with the menu. This man just came in and picked up the plates without even asking us. So, not too great at service either.

The chicken dishes here are usually good (half the times) but this review isn't about the chicken dishes.

This is the first time in any restaurant or bar where they have said that the snacks served with drinks are chargeable after 2 rounds. I have been here a couple of times and this has never happened before. In fact, this has never happened in any restaurant or bar before - ever.

Wouldn't recommend coming here anymore unless with your family

We went here on 7.4.15. We were a group of 8 people..I was very much disappointed with the food..the non veg food-chicken and fish was not cooked properly.the fish was smelling.. Freddy baby corn was still good. The rice & noodles served to us was ice cold.. I ordered exotic vegetables in chilly bean sauce.I had told them strictly that no mushrooms in it.he even made a note abt it.BT as expected a good lot f mushroom was there (for which he tried all ways to defend ). Wat I expected was an apology and some gesture to compensate us.. Forget the gesture,he was not even apologetic about it. I asked if he will waiver off the bill for that particular item (me being allergic to mushrooms) . he said he cannot bcoz I did not tell him in d beginning. That's such a lame argument ,I told him wen I saw the mushroom. He should have waivered off the price of that dish.. We promise to never come back here even if its d last restaurant in Kolkata.. A basic beverage fresh lime soda served to us was also not good..I really don't know if this quality food is served everyday or today was our bad day,I don't know.. But definitely we are not visiting this place again. .

We went there 2 days back for an early dinner and were pleasantly surprised by what the restaurant had to offer. We had Tom yum soup and chicken drumstick for starters.. Both were done very well. 
After a lot of deliberation we settled on pad Thai noodles, kung pao chicken and chilli paneer for main course. Though the pad Thai missed the traditional peanuts on top, the overall taste was very nice and well presented. 
We also packed fried squid as takeaway but it had become chewy by the time we reached home ( not the restaurant fault since it is meant for immediate consumption) 
It is a decent restaurant in this area and serves beer too. Overall we were very pleased and will return again.

Ok so me and my friend visited this place on a V-day eve just because we had sudden urge for some good chinese food and the place was just on a walking distance. To our wonder it was totally crowded and we could find a seat only after waiting for 10-15 minutes. The food was good. Their Monchow soup and Monchow noodles are delicious. It could have been even better given they  had not had to deal with so many orders. They have a bar too with with wide variety of drinks though we did not try out. Ambience is not very appealing but I will recommend my friends that if you are in Kolkata then atleast visit once.

Ok..so in 1 word shinryu is 'decent'. This place had been bookmarked by me many days from now since its not very far from my home and i have travelled a thousand times past it and never got a chance to drop by..but yesterday being saraswati puja for the bengalis(which of course is the bengali valentines day),i got a chance to go there for dinner with my valentine. A decent looking place,not so much impressive from inside but okayish. It was almost empty only 2 couples were there,we being the third. We chose our seats and got comfortably seated. Then we ordered 1 chilli garlic chicken fried rice and 1 kung pao chicken. They informed us that the chicken would consist of 8 diced pieces of chicken though when it arrived the size of the pieces made me wonder whether they were 8 pieces or rather 4 pieces forcibly cut into 8. Anyway,regarding the rice,quantity was ok,enough for 1 person but not enough for 2. Taste of both the dishes was really impressive..i loved the chicken specially. I don't have any complaint regarding the shredded pieces of chicken that they provided in the rice..there were ample. After it was over we decided to order 1 more plate of szechuan noodles. Now before the order was served we realised that we were nearly stuffed. Still after it came we decided to eat some and pack the rest. Somehow we finished the whole dish..well before finishing he found out 1 piece of hair in his plate!!! Before this i really had the impression that the place was very tidy but this incident left me questioning my own judgements. Well,after we complained they were really apologetic and brought us a neat plate. We were really stuffed by now and almost forced ourselves into finishing off the last amount. When we asked for the check out,they brought over dessert..2 scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce as a complementary dessert and simultaneously a mode of expressing how sorry they were for the hair. I really liked this act of theirs...with a bill of only 525 bucks,i liked the special saraswati puja dinner. Overall a decent and good restaurant though not very good..i would like to pay them another visit again..next time probably would finish off dinner without the free hair:-P

My First visit was on 16.01.2015 after a stressed out day at work and I was more than happy with the choice I made. I like the concept of serving maximum 4 drinks per person, this is very unique and am sure the only place in town which actually started to restrict over drinking and nuisance. The food is very tasty and hospitality is very decent. I wish to make more visit with friends and family in the near future. Wish Shinryu the best of business and good luck always!!!

During Durga Puja we landed up here basically because Aminia. our original destination, was overcrowded and overflowing with people ! We came in with no expectation and the food pleasantly surprised us. We ordered for Honey Lemon Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Mix Fried Rice and Hakka Chow. The food tasted good though the chicken starter didn't appeal to me. My mom loved it as the food was tasty without being overtly spicy. The ambiance is good enough with big aquariums to stare at and pass your time. And you'll need it......cause service really needs to be improved. Food took a while to arrive, which was okay with it being the festive season. But they took close to 30 mins to bring the bill due to some technical problem, they said. That kinda spoiled the otherwise great evening. But as far as the food goes, no complaints. :)

We ordered chicken soup and thai soup. Both were good. Starter was average. It was too much oily. Main course was disappointing. The chicken dish taste almost similar to the starter. All foods were too much garlicky. The hakka chow was average. Noodles was very much thick. Overall not satisfied.

Visited this place recently and was quite disappointed. We visited in the afternoon for lunch but was shocked to see the tables dirty, chair covers and table clothes unwashed. Definitely the overall housekeeping has gone down to pathetic levels. Next coming to the food, we ordered Drums of Heaven which were overcooked and were hard and chewy. From prior experience I knew that the chef's here use too much oil in all their dishes so instructed to use less oil but still the noodles came out dripping with oil. It was so oily that we were unable to eat. All the side dishes that we ordered were overcooked and nothing special to write about. By the end of the meal we were discussing if we can cook better Chinese at home or not. ¬†I think I may not visit this place again, given that I now have a better takeaway very near to this for Chinese food.

In the process of zeroing down best Chinese restaurant in Rajarhat area stopped by at Shinryu. Located exactly opposite to Aminia and next to Spencers. Parking is available outside the property.

Ordered Salt n Pepper Chicken, Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce and Chicken Chilly Garlic Chowmein.

Salt n Pepper Chicken: Its one of their best starters in the menu. Nice balance of salt and pepper tossed with 8 pieces of boneless chicken. Will surely awake your taste buds.

Chicken Chilly Garlic Chowmein: Taste is very ordinary with no hint of garlic in the taste. If you are looking for some spice factor only chili sauce was present in abundance in the dish. I don't want to be rude but taste will remind you of chow from street side junk food shop.

Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce: I thought I read "hot" in the name but trust me it was "sweet" garlic sauce. Looks to me either the chef got confused or typo error in the menu card.

Overall either the food seems to me over rated or their quality has deteriorated over time. Interior is very basic with tables and chair just in place. However the bill came to INR 625 for just 3 dishes. Only attraction was nice collection of fishes in aquarium. They do accept card payment and bar license still not there.

The restaurant is empty like ghost town while Aminia opposite to it has no place to stand. A large part of inside is unused and covered under dust as it has very less footfall. This restaurant has huge potential but its time for them to pull up their socks. They need to work on getting public attention.

First time visit on 2nd Oct 2014 Ashtami evening...though the menu was revised for the Pujas but service,food and ambience was good. Ordered French fish which is a kind of fried fish with mayo in new avatar and salt and pepper squid which were great...main course schezwan rice and kung pao chicken was satisfactory...Now a recent review of this restaurant's buffet 
I went yesterday for the lunch buffet @ Rs 199 all inclusive 
The menu included one soup(non veg with egg only, one veg starter (which had corn and onion and bell pepper crispy fried,  veg noodles, steamed rice and one fish gravy side dish. I was first informed as a chicken side diah. Finally disappointed before leaving they gave  me a chicken side diah as parcel. So happy I was...lol...the staff and management is good but before you go for the buffet please check the menu...miscommunication can be avoided.

The ambience was satisfactory..the food was just up to the mark but not perfect..we had ordered a chicken sweet corn soup which was yummy n delicious..among the starters we ordered,the chicken spring roll and fish finger topped the rank while the chicken lollipop and crispy chill prawn was just ok..
The main course was no doubt very tasty..the egg fried rice,mixed fried rice,chilli chicken and chicken in hot garlic sauce was the best food of the whole dine-out..overall a nice experience..:)

Also their Chiken with vegitable, Devils Chicken, Drums of heaven, Honey Lemon Chicken will definitly blust your test buds and lift you to cloud 9  :-)Though it is not mentioned in there menu but they serve Chimny Soup, try it with assorted fish.

We were planning to visit this place for long time. So today at around 4.30 we reached there with real hunger. The place was empty, ac was off n I found the ambience so so. We ordered some piking chicken (don't remember actually) from special menu , which came in a great amount and it was crispy and really tasty. For the main course we decided to experiment with lemon honey chicken which they told will be dry , so we opted for veg Cantonese noodles. The service was quick. The noodles was tasty . But the chicken came with raw honey which made it taste really bad. We had a bill around 630 which was not worthy with respect to the quantity.

Well we actually had made plans to pay a visit to the New Aminia Restaurant just opposite to this Chinese food joint but had changed our mind later only to realise that we had made the right decision. 
We had ordered for Shanghai Chicken in starters and Hakka Chilly lamb with Shrimp fried rice in the main course. The food was, in one word, delicious! The Shanghai Chicken, assorted with fried noodles was lip smacking. The lamb was soft and of course, scrumptious. The shrimps tasted so fresh, unlike some top class 5 star hotel cuisines. Overall it was an amazing experience. Truly,Chinese food is amazing when it is prepared by the Chinese!!
I'd specifically like to mention about the cordial waiters and their service. Would definitely love to visit this food joint again.

As I am a big fond of Chinese, I love to have it from different places/restaurants. I heard about shinryu near chinar park from my elder brother. I had been there with my girl friend, it is well decorated, neat and clean, good service, good behaviour, comfortable sitting, good quality, quantity is less - as we had ordered for two but it will not fulfill one's stomach and if u want to get filled your stomach full then u may run out of pocket huh it is lil bit expensive but it is good...

Did not have that many expectations when I visited the restaurant but to my surprise it turned out to be a memorable one. The food was really good and not like any other Chinese restaurants! We took the chicken 65 as starter and it was excellent. Although the Chilly Lamb didn't turn out to be the way I was expecting but that did not stop it from being delicious. Overall it was a good lunch and I hope to visit it once again.

I often pass through this restaurant when i go to city centre 2 but never got the chance to eat here but one fine day after our visit at spencers my mum decided that we should eat here. The restaurant is quite simple and the staffs were quite polite in nature. We ordered thai soup, chicken noodles and Singapore chicken. The food was served quickly and i must say ¬†that because i love the taste of lime i thoroughly enjoyed the soup and i loved the fact that the taste was lingering in my mouth for a long time. The noodles were also tasty and the singapore chicken was suggested to us by the staff and i think that it was a good suggestion as i found it to my liking. The dish had drops of egg all over it with 8 pieces of chicken. The bill amounted to Rs. 520 approx. which proved the fact that it is a pocket friendly place. Also the quantity they serve is not at all less as we were really full after we finished our lunch. I would definitely come back to eat here as the place is not crowded, food is good and pocket friendly so a big thumbs up at the same time this being a new joint i definitely think it has the scope to improve more.

The restro is done in Asian style with nice interior. I used to a regular visitor there and have been going there since its opening but now I am not going to eat there coz they serve horrible food and the staff is ill mannered. I found hair in my soup and they did nothing about it. It sucks.

Had been to this place twice. The ambiance is quite good for a family restaurant. ¬†However i would like to mention it as the best in its locality as far as Chinese food is concerned. MOMOs are quite good , second best in KOLKATA according to me ¬†(first being the Himalayan cafe without any doubt ) . ¬†Tried Thai pad noodles and Singapore noodles along with Shinryu lamb and devil chicken. The blend of the sauce and the spices were perfect in both the dishes.¬†However i would like to see the bar opening soon, as the empty drinks glasses near the cashier does not blend into the ambiance. Regarding price, i feel it is a little costly as similar dishes can be availed in the locality with much lower rates.Rest is best , 5/5 for food quality and taste.

I had been to the place just yesterday....It had a nice ambiance and the decor was based on Chinese and Thai..... The food was great too.....I had Mushroom Soup, Squid Delight, Drunken Fish and Pad Thai Noodles.....Every item was brilliant in taste and presentation...But ill give my best to the Squid Delight and Pad Thai Noodles....I could smell the white wine in the fish... Noodles Covered with a layer of omelet made it look more authentic.....Also the fish was really authentic.....This is a quiet place where you can enjoy with your friends and family....The bill was around 1300 bucks for two persons but the place really worth it.....

The best place to eat around the city centre Rajarhat area. Went there on New Year's eve. Thanks to Zomato otherwise wouldn't have known the place actually existed there. The ambience was really cool. Complete Chinese getup. Ordered chicken wontons, Thai soup and tom yum soup for starters. They were really good and the place kept up to my expectations. For main course ordered chicken Cantonese noodles and Szechuan rice with Kungpao and Honey lemon chicken. The main course was absolutely amazing! Especially the kung pao chicken. Yum-e! It's a great place for a family hangout and looking forward to go there again!

Situated right beside Chinar Park Spencer's, this restaurant is very conveniently located on the 6 Lane. 

The ambience is average and gives you a feel of restaurants in Tangra. It can seat a fairly good amount of people which you might not be able to judge at the entrance point. But with the amount of space available, the interior can be definitely worked on. 

I have visited this place several times since its inception and when they could not even accept credit cards. Last time I had visited this place was 2013 June and till then they were yet to receive bar license. After that although we have opted for take away several times but was not really interested on that part as we were not dining there at those times.

The foods here are again somewhere close to China Town. We have tried several starters but the ones we sincerely like in starters are Salt/Pepper Chicken & Chicken 65. In the main course Chilli Garlic Noodles taste quite good. We had also tried Pad Thai Noodles on one occasion but I did not much like it. I really swear by their Thai Sweet Chill Fish. Again their Drunken Fish was not much commendable. Of the other usual things we have tried can be termed as good but nothing super special. 

However, Tangra being a bit of a distant place from my home and given the location of this place, this is one of my favourite Chinese Restaurant. The items are priced decently and will not bite you. The staffs are very friendly and helpful, well behaved and courteous. 

In a nutshell, good food at reasonable price. So if you happen to be around Rajarhat City Centre 2...and looking for good Chinese food...this is a must try. Trust me, the food can beat the Chinese restaurants located within City Centre 2.

The ambience is really very good, it will give u the proper feel that one looks for in a Chinese restaurant. The service is good and quick. But the quality of the food is not up to the mark. It is not worth the money you pay. Same with the mocktails, not really that great.. Its average. But the dessert is good except the custard, the ice-cream is good and fried ice-cream is a must try ... the price is a bit on the higher side but again its a place u can once go and give it a try.

Heard quite a bit about this place and specially for Chinese menu ( which I am not a big fond of), although as that is something my wife likes very much, thought to celebrate our first month of wedding there. Two things noticed at the very beginning - A very poor staff and a very ordinary ambience, even the seating is organized just like that. 

Coming to the menu section I did not find it much organized or decorated in such a way that it will be mouth watering, rather the dishes were mostly very familiar or pretty ordinary. Anyway we ordered for a Margheritta as a drink( which I found better than rest of the orders) For soup we had simple Hot and Sour(seemed to me as okayish) with Sui Mui( thought something special) which appeared as a open version of MOMO and nothing else,taste wise too that did not make me feel at all anything special. I went straight forward to the Chicken sizzler which was poorer than any street made chicken sizzler which had some veggies not even sauteed properly and a small dump of rice without any flavour and the sauce was also not enough. Mix Singapore noodles is the one which I could say good but the waiter asked me to go with Kungpao Chicken which was nothing but a disappointment. On a whole I believe For this above menu Rs 1222 and 2 and half hours time was not really worthy specially having such a brilliant location at the Chinar Park crossing.

Ambience - 2
Menu - 2
Hospitality - 2
Food - 3

If you live near City Center 2, having decent Chinese food was a challenge. Yes, the Hang Out in the City Center 2 has some Chinese outlets, but those cannot be called a full-blown restaurant. Also, I did not had much liking for Ying Yang after reading some scathing reviews about them. So, last night, I decided to grab some food from Shinryu near the Chinar Park. I had it in my mind for quite long but never had a chance till yesterday.

On the outset, the surroundings of the restaurant do not do any justice to it but hey, think about the China Town in Kolkata - scarcely a place that you can term as clean. So, notwithstanding this discouraging part, I galloped into the restaurant and ordered for some assorted foods.

The price is reasonable. They will not leech you. The interior could have done with a bit more innovative decor. The sitting area is quite large which is very difficult to judge from the outside. The bar is not open yet and they had bottles of Slice in the place of Bourbon. What a shame. But, they said that by next month, they will have permit to open the bar. Cheers.

Now to the food. The starter Salt n Pepper Chicken tasted good with the right mix of chili, garlic, pepper etc. The Szechwan Chicken tasted good but felt like more of a hot garlic sauce base rather than the fiery style that we normally experience. The Honey Lemon Chicken is a bit sweet to suit my tongue but may be someone else would like it. The noodles tasted ok but a bit on the thicker side if we compare with the regular joints in the China Town. I wish they will correct this going forward. Thick noodles just do not feel right. At the end, all of the dishes had a certain smoky flavor which I think is due to Sesame Oil.

Summarily, it is a nice place to visit with good but not-so-innovative interior and lighting. The place has quite a large menu to select from, and I felt the food quality to be good but they have some strides to make to be great.

Located near chinar park area of rajarhat new town, Shinryu is my favorite destination for chinese food in this part of the city though to be honest, i have had the oppurtunity to eat their food not more than 2-3 times.

The restaurant offers chinese, thai food. Prices are pretty much parallel to or a bit less compared to bar -b-q, tung fong restaurants and the serving is generous. So it wont be fair to compare it with chinese takeaway destinations like buzz, blossom  or crystal chimney and should be perceived as a proper restaurant.  The decor and ambience at the restaurant is average. The staff is polite, humble. I feel the owners take a lot of interest in attending to the customers themselves going by my interactions with one of the co-owners by name of Claire which is laudable.

Coming to the food, the menu is a bit small but they seem flexible in preparing dishes as per the choice of customers even if the same is not in the menu. Starters are good especially the chilli babycorn, paneer. I tried spring rolls recently which tasted good but was a bit too oily. Szechuan fried rice, chilli garlic noodles are really good. The side dishes are well made with great quality ingredients. Manchurian, exotic vegetables are the ones i have had till now and both tasted nice. 

Overall, love the food here and looking forward to trying other dishes from or OUTSIDE the menu !!!!!!!

Today we went to Shinryu for Dinner. At 8:30 PM, most of the place was empty, considering that it was a Sunday and a holiday. Dinner did not take too much time to serve. But what was dampener was the taste as well the quantity of the food being served. You would expect to be served at least a portion, which one individual can eat, but in almost all cases, the quantity was so less and quality well below the mark that we had to leave with a more/less empty stomach. Considering the quantity served, rate are very exorbitant. In the last couple of months, quality of the food has really fallen.

6th December, 2013 we visited this place with friends and family. That was our first visit to this place. We have heard about this place from one of our friend. The place was nice and simple. The owner or the Manager welcome us with a great smile. We ordered for crab meat sweet corn soup and chicken wanton soup. And for starter crispy baby-corn and one lamb item. The waiter first served us Soup and same time he wanted to serve us the crispy baby-corn. When we requested him to serve the baby-corn later (when we will finish the soup) he replied us very rudely. We ordered Thai red curry and flat noodle and sezwan fried rice for main course.  The food was very good, and the portions were well enough. I must say this place will be a big hit because in this area we donot have much good restaurant. We just loved the food. But through out our dinner the behavior of the waiter was not good at all as if they are not at all happy. IT cost nothing to serve food with a smile, but it will create a big difference in customers' mind.

I had been to this place on a Sunday afternoon and was amazed that it was stark empty at 1.45. The welcome was a bit strained effort on the part of the waiter, no manager to do this part. Strangely the best seats, I had my kid with me who wanted to sit by the aquarium, was reserved for God know who - who did not turn up. So we sat on the  adjacent table and used the reserved seats to keep our bags.
The menu is simple and so is the furniture - not at all comfortable and sufficient. We started off with a chimney soup, which was served in an aluminium chimney, Eauchew serves in copper ones. But it was tasty and we lapped up the last droplets. Then we had shrimp suimai, very well prepared. It was a revelation that chinese starters could go so well with our very own Kasundi. But the main course was not up to the mark. The Thai Pad noodles, which was served in an envelope of fried egg was too oily and the envelope itself was both bland and burnt. The Drunken Fish was just about okay. 
We finished off with caramel custard which was soft and with the proper sweetness.
On the whole I found this place to be just an average restaurant with exorbitant pricing, One major advantage is  the whole staff know and speak English, Bengali and Hindi fluently.

As close to Tangra Chinese as one can get in this part of town.Started of quite well , but of late , their standards have dipped a wee bit.Stick to the Chinese in the menu and you wouldn't be disappointed .The Thai cuisine here is well below par and best avoided.They have hiked their prices recently and from my last experience a few weeks back when I did a take away was their quantity had gone down with the increase in price.Definitely worth a try though .

Last month me and my friend visited shinryu......we ordered pad thai noodles and honey lemon chicken.  OMG I must say...both of them had heavenly taste......:) so yummy....that we were in a state of surprise as the taste was beyond our expectation.Really good.

But one thing I must mention here that..the price is a bit on the higher side...I mean that,Rs 209 +tax  for 6 very  small boneless pieces of chicken in the "honey-lemon chicken" is really unaffordable sometimes.

Went to Shinryu yesterday after seeing 4.1 rating at Zomato. The experience was horrible. As it was my first visit hence as usual ordered basic stuffs instead of fancy:mixed tom yum soup, mix fried rice & hakka noddles and honey chicken  . Then we asked the waiter about what's the spicy chicken dish he would recommend. He recommended dragon chicken and we went for that. 
The seafood that was present was not at all fresh , it was having fishy smell. I think seafood is from Metro C&C seafood mix instead of fresh. 
The noddles and fried rice are very ordinary ,even road side roll center will provide you better testing one. The fried rice was having ghee/dalda smell too.

The most horrible part was the two chicken dishes. Those were too thickly coated with corn flower batter that you wouldn't test the chicken at all. Though the waiter told us that the dragon chicken will be spicy, it was as sweet as honey chicken. It seems they fry the chickens one day for a week and serve through out the week. It was not fresh at all, forget about the taste.
Seeing their basic cooking skill and intentions of serving stale food, don't think they can ammend  themselves by any means. 
I was thinking seeing 4.1 rating that we got a good restaurant in Chinar Park area. But I proved to be wrong . It would have been better if I drove for 20 odd km for good old big boss.
Don't know how it got good rating , either paid review or special food prepared for them. As I said earlier I don't see any hope for redemption.

Brilliant Ambience! Nice Decor..  First time tried a take away. Discovered a chinese(probably) couple watching a hindi movie, must be the owners of the esteemed place. I felt the ambience of china town inside, rather better. I tried Chicken Gravy Noodles. The taste was really good but to an Indian, the quantity was pretty little, it was apt for the Japanese but not for the Indian, although I can not eat much, taste matters the most. The people providing services were pretty modest. I have got a suggestion to the owners..  kindly don't run any Indian movies in your esteemed place because the serenity of your beautiful place gets ruined, i would not suggest your to play any discovery channel or similar shows there either. Rather you can use animations, cartoons instead. These are mere humble suggestions from a naive customer, not an expert. These are just my opinions. Congratulations to both of you for your endeavour in providing us with such a unique restaurant in the vicinity.

I was quite surprised on my recent visit to Kolkata, when I visited Newtown for the first time and seeing how un-Kolkata-like it is. My friend had heard good reviews about this place and given that I was very hungry after my travel, I readily agreed.

For starters, the reviews were not off. The place had a good selection on their menu, but since we were very hungry we went for the basics ‚Äì a wholesome meal of noodle and chicken with some squids on the side. The squid, though, was slightly over fried, but it was flavored well so it was not totally un-enjoyable. The noodle was pretty good, with a generous proportion of prawns and chicken, none of which was overcooked. The Kung Pao Chicken too was succulent and nicely done. 

Their squid flavor would have worked really well with pork ‚Äì so I was slightly disappointed that they do not serve pork (or beef). But overall, it was good experience and we left well fed.

Hi! Shinryu is  the best Restaurant in the vicinity of VIP Road & Newtown as far as Authentic & innovative chinese cuisine is concerned.Earlier we used to frequent Tangra for authentic chinese cuisine...thanx to Shinryu now we dont have to go miles for a good meal! I have been associated with the F & B world with over 30 years  and needless to say that I am a connoisseur of food & a frequent diner on weekends with my family.Ever since it came into operation in the month of April, I have been here on umpteen occasions!The food is good & value for money......I suggest one should try Spicy crispy chill baby corn,Crispy Chilli Potatoes, Thai Sea-food Soup,Prawn Balls with sweet chilli sauce,Chicken 65 a-la chinese style, Golden Fried Tiger Prawns which I find hard to resist among lots of other dishes offered.Infact the last time I visited on 02nd August , One of the owners Ms Claire offered us  as complimentary on  our table a new veg starter in the  form of Mini  Fried Corn Cakes ,  which she was proposing to introduce in the menu.I must say it was very well done & lip-smacking veg starter & I insisted she must put it on the menu!They have also come up with Combo Meals during lunch hours & smartly priced between 225/- to 300/-The interior is nice.Very recently they have added an aquarium , just at the entrance.One can expect to get satisfactory service & value for money & it  is a must-dine restaurant with the family.A word of caution..........please be prepared to wait on weekends due to the rush between 1930-2130 hrs as it is difficult to find a place without prior reservation!Wish you add more space & hope the Bar will be operative very soon!

How would u feel when u along with ur frnds were just about to get into a restaurant and suddenly ur eyes got stuck in a notice outside it that read 'Only cash is accepted' ? Still it was not the case of First impression is the last impression as the food served was good enough to cast a good impression on you. We went in a group of 3, and 1 of us ordered a mixed fried rice and on being suggested by one of their staffs, took Honey Lemon chicken....Mixed fr.rice was satisfying, though more was expected from a restaurant serving  Chinese delicacies....but the chicken one was as quirky it could get as the name suggested; honey was as thick as galvanised rubber that too sprawled over on the bottom of the plate; hail LORD 4 giving us strength to scrape it out....perhaps next tym they need to serve a Scrotch bite with it as an accessory.....tastewise this dish though features in the main item category should have come up as a starter...we also had a sizzler which was O.K by its standard....
1 more thing, the BAR hasn't opened yet...
So,for our overall xprnce, only 2 of my fingers would give an ovation for this place.May be they need to work upon more on the quality of the food served, then only they can dream of a 5 on 5 !!

I went there for a quick dinner. The decor is nice, clean and spacious. The service was good.  We ordered Shinryu special shredded chicken, mixed Hakka chow and hot garlic chicken.  
The starter tasted good, but it was too crispy! I couldn't find any taste of chicken, it can be easily called crispy potatoes or crispy babycorn. The chow was quite good, and I loved the hot garlic chicken. It had just the right mix of sweetness and spices. For dessert we ordered a caramel custard. The caramel was a bit extra burnt, resulting in a bitter taste. 
The portions were quite large, enough for 2. The bill came around 800. But the bill was handwritten, with the VAT amount calculated and added at the bottom. That did not look impressive. Also they do not accept cards, which is a big flaw. 
Overall the experience was satisfactory, and since there is a lack of good restaurants in this area, I think Shinryu has a good headstart. I will definitely go back when I crave some Chinese and feel too lazy to head to Tangra!

on the 1st May I visited Shinryu with family since they all love chinese food. I asked the owner Joseph Lai to show me around the place which he did. I must tell you the experience at Shinryu was wonderful. Firstly the kitchen area is so neat and tidy, and Joe and his team work so well and so polite with the angry customers at time. Is something for all foodies to also understand that just eating in a restaurant is not everything, you need to size up the management, the kitchen ( whether the food that is being prepared is hygenic) , the quality of food, the interior decorations, cleanliness of the restaurant and the crockery, the wait time period of service. And when you consider all these parameters in your rating of a restaurant, just do not see to the quality of food only when you rate. Thats exactly what i did in my rating for this amazing chinese restaurant. The 160 covers restaurant is i would say state of the art, most of the furniture has been imported from china. The entire restaurant is spread across 3000sq ft of space. 

The food was brilliant as good as the good old Kim Fa of tangra, but definitely better than Bar B que and other tangra restaurants, therefore now people in north kolkata need not have to travel to tangra for get authentic chinese food. The items that i really enjoyed were the kung fao prawns, the starters, the mefoon ( rice noodles) and the chicken items were really delicious.  

I think once the restaurant can get the bar license this restaurant will go many mile.

Me & and my wife suddenly found this restaurant in our neighbourhood and went there for dinner on 28th April. It's a nice place to be with family. Nice ambiance, good food and pocket friendly rates. But the only issue I faced that day was with the service. Felt they are running out of stuffs. 
Overall we liked the food and planning to visit soon.

It was my first visit to the restaurant with family. It is the best Chinese restaurant in the area within the budget. People staying near VIP Road to Airport and Rajarhat need not goto Tangra anymore for authentic Chinese food. The ambiance of the restaurant is good. Staffs are needed to be bit trained. Apart from that everything is good. Food is very good.

The place is very nice and the ambienceis superb compared to all the other resturants in the area. Considering you are out with your family I feel it is a good place to take them to. Reasons:-
1. The food is really really good and the taste feels really authentic.
2. The interior is well designed & when inside you feel you have come to a good resturant.
3. If you are visiting a resturant it means you want to spend some good time chatting and have good food at the same time without disturbance. You get that here.
4. Its right beside the Chinarpark crossing so transportation is available till quite late even if you don't have your own car.
5. Though the food is yummy the price is very reasonable and so you won't leave a hole in your pocket.

We love eating out, and we love Chinese food; however there weren't any good Chinese restaurants in our area - Baguihati VIP Road (comparable to our favorite joints in Tangra, in terms of quality of food and pocket pinch).

So we were very happy to have discovered Shinryu. I am writing this review after 3 visits to the restaurant.

The restaurant is run by a Chinese family and the food is lip-smackingly excellent. All dishes that we have tried have been fantastic; however some special recommendations are the Prawn on Toast, Moon Wontons, Hunan Chicken (cooked Chinese home style, with potatoes); the fried rice there  has converted me and my wife from serial noodle enthusiasts to rice fans.

The place is clean, well lit, and the decor is nice (not garish and in your face like many Chinese restaurants I know).

Finally the pocket pinch - very very reasonable. As mentioned, a complete meal for 2 will set you back by Rs.600 or so (without alcohol).

No need to make the long trip to Tangra any more.

First of all the restaurant is for those people who have lot of time in their hands and when I say a lot I "mean" it. When you arrive at the restaurant you have to wait , wait and wait for someone to hand you the menu and after you give the order the wait is like forever. Its not only you who end up waiting but everyone around you as well with empty plates and desperation and hunger in people's faces. The worst part was when we went to the restaurant and after we had given the order they went out of chicken and no one bothered to inform us that the dish that we ordered will not be delivered to us and we ended up waiting for the food for sometime before getting fed up of it. The most grossy part was that the person who was handling our food had a cold and was wiping his nose with his hands and we hope we did not picked up any thing from there. . They told us that they  were short of employees but since we went on Valentines Day they should have anticipated the crowd and could have managed the situation better.Overall the food was excellent and the atmosphere was good but the service was pathetic which ruined the whole experience.
