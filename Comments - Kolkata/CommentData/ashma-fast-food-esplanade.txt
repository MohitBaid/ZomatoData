Feeling Great to be the First reviewer. Its always feels good to be the one.

Eating outside have been a daily habit for us. So we keep looking for good Restos, Cafes as well as fast food joints. Talking about the fast food so With so many fast food places in Esplanade i found this newly opened fast food centre at Benntick Street today while looking for some quick bites.

Located at the Bentinck street just near the G.C ave and S.N banerjee road crossing this place gives you some good variety of food stuffs.

Not too big but some decent sittings  on the upper floor with air conditioned. Accomodated with steel chairs and glasss tables above looks very fine neat and clean. Staff are well behaved and polite.

Coming to the food so we all required some quick bite so ordered Chicken Roll for us. The roll looked very different in color. It was yellowish when asked they said they include some spice to make it so.

The Paratha looked fab and from the preparation to the rolling was clearly very hygenic. Taste was very good. Tried so many places before, and after so many days any roll center satisfied me so much. Paratha was hard and crunchy and chicken used was frensh and good in quantity. Prices are very pocket friendly.

People going that way should try their roll once.
