This place was suggested by a friend. It's a small place and I found it quite congested, there's no proper waiting area. The ambience and the decor is not really up to the mark. I had ordered one starter- "Hara Bhara Kebab", two main course - "Dal Makhani" and "Bombaiya Paneer butter masala" and two breads- "Garlic naan" and "masala kulcha". Since, this was my first visit, I had stuck to the basics. The kebab was sweet in taste and the chutney served along was stale. While eating the kebab, I found a hair in it, so hygiene wise the place is miserable. The dal makhni was very thin and lacked the texture. The paneer butter masala was not at all good. The breads had a flavor of yeast. Overall, a very bad experience.

when i and my friends first shifted to kolkata in a p.g, this was the first resto we ordered food from and since then this was our dinner place every single day. We (around 20 guys) used to order loads of stuffs everyday like malai kofta, dal fry, aloo dum, rajma, bundi raita, all sorts of breads and papads and still it used to cost us 50- 60 per dinner. this place's food made me nostalgic. It was finger lickin good. and when my mom dad arrived kolkata once, i took them there for dinner. They loved it too. the ambience is sober and service is good. all for a reasonable price.

They have some amazing North Indian food which can fulfill your desire for a bit of homely touch. We ordered Mix Veg with Yellow Dal Tadka, some chapatis coupled with Boondi Raita. 
Not only was the food served hot and fresh, the service was fast enough. They are a new place and have a little less seating space if a rush comes in!

New Deeya Bati is located near Nepal Sweets in Elgin. The place is  small with decent interiors. They serve thallis which are amazing. Khadai panner and masala kulcha is one of the best dishes which they serve. Veg Biriyani was not upto mark. Vegetable Jalfrezi was healthy and tasty. 
Cold coffee with ice-cream was tooo good. A purely veg restrau with friendly staff and minimum pocket pinch. Worth a visit.

Ordered the Gold Budget Lunch from this restaurant a few days back. I got 4 chappatis, dal, two sabjis, papad and dal. The food was not great, but not bad either. It was well packed. Just want to comment on a couple of things - the menu says that the two sabjis will be of the diner's choice, but the choice was never asked. They sent a paneer gravy sabji and alu dum. The paneer was a big square chunk with gravy on it and the alu dum was quite oily. Also, most restaurants that serve thalis, including this one, give lots of rice and are very stingy when it comes to dal and sabji.

I ordered the dinner online. The dinner came pretty late from the expected time and that too today when the roads are vacant. Well the quantity of the food was extremely less compared to all other restaurants. The food seemed as if they were half plate. The quality of food was good but when there is so less quantity u cannot actually fill your stomach.

For once a wise man said..."To touch the soul....you must reach the belly...and calm the tummy" hahaha!! No actually m the wise man for this quote...:D 

But this quote should perfectly define the amazing food & services of New Deeta Bati. :) :)

Deeya Bati...hindi term for "Small earthen lamps"....is a pure vegetarian restaurant....serving all types vegetarian dishes, from mughali to chinese, at a very affordable price ‚ò∫

Located at Bhawanipore, quite near the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College....its a 10 mins walk. The crowd here is mainly families and friends coming to have lunch and dinner and have a good time. Bonhomie in one word.

The restaurant is well known in the Bhawanipore locality for it delicious food and homely services..the management is very professional, but takes care of its customers like their own family. Very welcoming and calm ambience, not your party type, loud music etc...people come here to eat peacefully..away from all the cacophony..so dont expect it to be something like that of any cafes...


Coming to the food..i have only one word for it..."Lajawab..!!" Too good....!! I am not a very big fan of pure vegetarian food..but this place changed my views and gave me a taste of reality, that, vegetarian food can also have a huge variety of delicacies and can be the most tasteful.

Thanks!! Deeya Bati.

Food suggestion : Try their combos...which comes at a very affordable rate and in good amount.

                 ~~„Ää SPECIAL MENTION „Äã~~

The waiters are absolutely wonderful. One thing that i really look for in every place i visit...is that...the service and the management behaviour. And Deeya Bati wins hands down. THANK YOU!! For your beautiful service and making our visit a pleasant experience
                                 ~~~ ‚ô° ~~~

SOUMEN'S RATINGS :-

Food: 5/5
Ambience: 3/5
Management: 5/5


Happy food hunting..... :)

The place is situated in Sarat Bose Road, it needs some interior decoration and ambience development. 
Appetizers tasted great, specially crispy chilly babycorn was lip smacking.
North Indian needs improvement in flavour and quantity. 
Service staff and low pocket pinch fetch some browny points for the place.

It is beyond expectations
Its vegetarian friendly 
The best part is it's consistency.

A small little lunch option when am at sarat bose road. Interiors are pretty basic. Service is fast and servers are friendly. The portion served is huge, have tried north Indian here, kabab for a starter is good. Chinese here is also decent, fried rice is good here. Loved the american chopsey here, the quantity of noodle is more than sufficient for a meal. The best part about this place is the economy it provides dinning in this area.

Firstly, this place is underrated in here.
Secondly, this joint should be included in Zomato's 'Student Faves' collection, which is actually pocket friendly.
Thirdly, it serves the cheapest tummy-filling veg buffet there is at 100. Yes, yummy too.
I have been here quite a number of times during my first year of college. Then there was this abrupt pause. Today, there I was again, after two years with faint nostalgia and reminiscence.
Not a sucker for a total veg buffet, but this place holds an exception to that rule.
Since my first time, except once, I had as if sworn fealty to Gold Budget Lunch. xD
Finger licking good, in true sense. The side dish and daal. Everything comes in small bowls, the vegetables, the rice, the daal but occupies a large space in your stomach. I could never eat till the last bit. Two tandoori roti or 4 chapatti and rolled papad at the end. And served with the juiciest, softest and smallest onions.
This is what I always have with variations in the veggies and I absolutely love it with utter satisfaction.
Two years ago the meal was 80/- and now it's a 100/-.
After two years probably, another rise by 20 ?
Still will be the cheapest and one of the tastiest. (:

A Pure Veg restaurant including Jain Food, it serves variety of cuisines such as North Indian, Chinese, Continental and South Indian. Going by the price chart which is definitely on the reasonable side, the food is quite good. We had tried North Indian cuisine and each of the item was pretty good. Overall, a simple place which actually serves your taste buds when you're hungry.

Located in a realtors delight, Deeya Bati isn't a place one usually will enter while looking for a fine dining place. Had it not been for my free coupons from Kolkata Quiz Festival, I wouldn't have either. It was a Saturday night and we were the only diners all throughout our stay. And,the drawbacks of the restaurant end there. Very courteous staff, and hot-freshly cooked food, all work in its favour. We ordered Kashmiri Aloo Dum, Bombay Paneer Butter Masala along with Kulcha. The Kulcha was hot and crispy, pretty nicely done. The butter masala and the dum are a must try if you're planning to visit!

this place used to be only "diya bati" around 9-years ago, when I was a regular visitor to this small homely resto, located just behind a lane near nepal sweets in sarat bose road. this place will be actualy described to be near the st.johns diocesan school. now coming to the food, I am a huge huge fan of their indian cuisine. i was a kid when me and my mom used to go there almost twice in a month, so this place is kinda memory down lane place for me. kashmiri aloo dum, dal makhni, veg do pyaza, tandoori roti and peas pulao was our all time favouite and a must to order dishes whenever we go there. its been a long time since i have paid a visit here, so dont know about the quality of food changing in these years, but all in all, this place holds a very memorable theory in my heart and I would love to drop there sometime soon :-) :-)

This is a small restaurant at Mulen Street besides Nepal Sweets of Sarat Bose Road. It has no great ambiance to delight but has tasty foods to delight your taste buds. I have tried their Mater paneer, Tandoori alu and tawa chapati. It is great to enjoy home like ghee tawa chapati made of good quality aata; at the time when almost restaurant are serving tandoori rotis made of unhealthy maida. I  appreciate this chapati options. If you really wanna satisfy your taste buds,  you can visit this outlet.

This place is total mixture of good and pathetic things. NOTE: By using the word 'MIX' I really mean a mixture of churma and sand particles to be true.
The good thing (Churma) is the traditionally Indian food.
The bad things (sand particles) is the ill-mannered staffs, their pathetic service time and no common sense at all to serve lime soda after desert , when that was the first thing that I had ordered with the starters, reason stated was they forgot the lime soda to be brought to our table. Plus The small space and lack of accommodation and like that was not all they might ask you to share your tables with 2 different customers. 3 customers on a single table eating 3 different menu. God!! I really would never visit this place ever again in my entire life.

Diya Baati the food at this restaurant is really good.We had tried only the North Indian section and it was worth the money.But recently when i ordered food from there for home delivery initially the fellow said they will deliver.But later on called up to say since it is a sunday they will do the delivery only if i ordered for more then Rs 1000.My bill was just for Rs 450.Its funny that at the top of this page it says that they do DELIVERY IF THE BILL IS OF A MINIMUM OF RS 350.I am quite dissapointed.

My most favorite place in the city .. Have been regular ever since I was a toddler .. Masala kulcha they serve here sets a benchmark for others .. So are other food items .. Undoubtedly the best vegetarian restaurant in the city ..!

The go to place for yummy and mind bogglingly cheap veg thali.  This is coming from a strict non vegetarian like me. Definitely worth a try!

Located near bhawanipore college, this used to be our lunch place in college days. The ambiance is not great nothing fancy, but the food they serve its pretty quite good and quite reasonable in price.

It is a completely vegetarian restaurant.  It generally remains houseful throughout the day. The menu is very simple and price is reasonable. It is located near diocessan school opposite roy street on sarat bose road.

I have been to this place many times. It's mostly crowded during peak hours. The food is nice. You might find it cramped up mainly because of the small space it has.

I ordered american choupsey, crispy chilly babycorn and hara bhara kabab. Found hara bhara kabab and the chutney they give along with it to be nice but crispy chilly babycorn and american choupsey were not upto the mark and i cannot think of ordering food again from here.

A small place located down the lane, next to Nepal Sweets. You won't find any board/hoarding at the entry of the lane denoting it's presence, which might lead to confusion about its location. The restaurant features bad interiors with the only decoration being a few stencil paintings on the walls & no real ambiance. The place is 'brightly lit'. The food is good though. If dining alone, ordering the lunch thali would be a good option. The paneer tikka & the main course tastes good. This place also serves the best tawa roti, but some dishes seriously need to be less oily while the soup section needs a major overhaul.

Ghar ka khaana served appropriately.. the lunch combos are good and nicely priced.. However, there are issues of availability. South Indian food is good specially Idli and Onion Masala Dosa.

Went over here once with family for dinner.. We were not suppose to visit it but then it was unplanned visit to this place.. Firstly it is a nice place but I didn't found the food that good it was not up to the level of my expectations..  Staffs behaviour was bad.. They were treating really badly which one don't expect obviously.. Food was bad too according to me.. Bad experience !!

Been here for a couple of times....The food quality is degraded and secondly the ambiance is no less then a road side dhaba! 
The kitchen is totally open, it just has a roof on the top......how much better it could be!!!!

I have been visiting since school days. Purely vegetarian restaurant. Though small but comfortable. Service is very good . Quality and quantity of food is great in accordance with the price which is pocket friendly. If you like veg or if you are a pure vegetarian do visit this place . Others should also visit this place once

Location: Sarat Bose Road, near Nepal Sweets. 

Have visited this place quite a few times, the ambiance isn't that great, but the Food quality is good considering a specific cuisine, the other really needs improvement. 

Talking about the food, 

Pindi chana 
Boiled perfectly and has the perfect balance of spices. 
Recommended.¬† 
(Only available on weekends). 

Dal makhni 
Black lentils cooked well. Tasted great.¬† 

Kashmiri Aloo dum 
Originally is slightly sweet, but out here was substantially sweet. 
Wasn't worth it. 

Paneer butter masala 
Paneer cubes were tender and succulent.¬† 
The dish had more gravy to it. 

Vegetable do pyaaza 
All the veggies were fresh and juicy. 
Tasted great.¬† 

Butter Naan 
Soft and brushed with little butter.¬† 

Masala kulcha 
The filling tastes great, bread is perfectly baked in tandoor.¬† 
Recommended.¬† 

Garlic Naan 
Tastes good, has the right amount of garlic to it.¬† 

Crispy Chilli Babycorn 
Refrain from ordering. That's all I can say. 

Mixed hakka noodles 
Was an average dish, have had better.¬† 

Veg Manchurian and Chilli Paneer 
Wasn't great at all. Both dishes lacked flavors and the Paneer in the latter chewy.  

The staff is well-informed but, a bit laid back. 
The prices are friendly to the pocket.¬† 

A ¬†great experience considering the North Indian fare. 
Improvements required in the Chinese fare.¬† 

Four stars from me (considering the North Indian cuisine) 
-1 due to the negatives.¬† 

Overall an average place to dine.

Good food specially North Indian... This place is a heaven for vegetarians who want good food at affordable price. The usual North Indian ala carte menu has awesome options, also the thali/combo options are good and flexible. Veg do piazza and aloo dum is worth a mention.
All said and done ambience and decor is not upto the mark. If that is not a concern, go ahead and dig into the awesome spread they offer....

The food is good; the ambience sucks. North Indian is really nice but the South Indian is nothing special. The Chinese was good in quality and quantity. Value of Money is a 5 star!! Best for friends to go but not a place to go with family or clients.

A few times over the last few months, I have walked over to this little outlet on Mullen Street while taking classes at Bhawanipur College.

So far I have only had the Budget lunch which fills your stomach pretty well for just eighty rupees. In that you get two tandoori rotis (with lots of butter), two vegetables of your choice, a small bowl of rice, papad onion and pickle. The onions are the pickled in vinegar variety!

FOr the vegetable, I have tried the paneer butter masala which was rich but decent (wish the paneer was fried though), the matar paneer (good), the chana masala (decent) and the malai kofta which was over-sweet and too rich and the gravy did not seep into the kofta. The tandoori rotis are well made.

The service is fast and the place clean and decent. The ACs work well. No tax added. What more could you want but some non-veg :) I tried a fresh lime soda the other day (not bad at all) but it added 50% to the bill by costing Rs 40.

Overall the food is a tad rich and spicy. Something that cannot be eaten on a regular basis. But for a once in a while meal, you probably cannot beat the value here.

Decent homely food. Since I have been eating out everyday, some times I get my pod delivered by these folks. Inexpensive food and decent quality for the price being offered at. I mostly take their meals which are delivered in PVC containers. Neat stuff!
