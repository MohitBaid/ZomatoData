Cheating with WRONG DISH!
I ordered for VEG THALI, which has a PEAS PULAO. In the thali, they just gave boiled rice with three peas on top and said it's their style of Peas Pulao. Its not froed with ghee, jeera, nuts etc.. They switched OFF AC too in the afternoon 3 pm hot time. Though i insisted to switch ON the AC, no response. Highly untrained staff..

This place is opposite to Quest and has one of the best Pav bhajis in the area. I however, am fond of there their ghee dosa. It’s thin crispy at the edges and by far a place that gives better sambhar than most other places. Like their lychee delight drink too.

An initiative by Gupta brothers, serving delicious sweets and vegetarian dishes. Located opposite to the lane of Quest mall, this small joint serves fabulous snacks and sweets. The food is really good. The ambience is relaxing but not very spacious. Their chai & coffee are one of the best for sure. The service is a little slow but the staff members are courteous. 
Overall good place, would love to visit again!

Haven't been to their outlet, however ordered their Veg Thali once.
The Thali was HUGGGGGEEEEEE. Rice, roti, two sabzis, dal, dahi vada, gulab jamun and onions. The quantity is amazing but I didn't like the quality.
They served butter paneer and alu dum which weren't upto the mark. The dal was good. I generally hate dals however the dal they served was extremely tasty.

One of my Go-to places when i crave a vegetarian treat!!!
ambience is nice and so is the decor!!
Masala dosa: comforting..and the sambhar that comes with it is damn good!

Pav Bhaji: It's yummy but the bhaji had too much onion in it..the quantity of the bhaji wasn't sufficient either.

They make really good veg pizzas..crispy on the edge and loaded with cheese!

Chola tikki: big aloo tikki fried in ghee topped with dahi,chole and bhujiya was delightful!

Veg burger and vada pav are filling and yummy!Crispy chilli babycorn is incredibly crispy and tasty!Tomato soup was warm and deliciously sour!

They serve awesome thalis too!!If you're looking for a nice veg thali then go for this place without a second thought!

I have one little request..please add radhaballavi and aloo dum to your menu..i have eaten it at your sweet shops and it's amazing!! It must make it to the menu of your restaurant !!

Well, review # 300 (Triple century – 300 not out )

This place was on my hitlist since inception – since I am a big fan of the Guptas brand – and may be have visited almost all their outlets in Kolkata – atleast once!

They are comfortably located nearby the Bata, opposite Quest mall and the size of the place is not huge. We went for their popular veg buffet breakfast – which is quite reasonably priced at just 180 bucks! For 180 bucks only, an unending buffet of the following items were on offer:-

(i)	Club kachori with aloo ki sabji – a winner – crisp kachori and tasty sabji

(ii)	Golab patti Sandesh – Superb – Full marks for both presentation and taste

(iii)	Veg sandwich (plain) – nothing great

(iv)	Sambhar vada – with sambhar, coconut chutney, red chutney – a good one

(v)	Sugar free Sandesh – pure chhena – however, the taste was missing

(vi)	Khandvi – I did not enjoy it since I do not like this item in general

(vii)	Jalebi – I do not know why, but I did not get to eat a single “hot” piece of it – It definitely looked like a million bucks – but since it was not being served hot and crisp – diners in general did not enjoy it

(viii)	Idli – A turn off

(ix)	Masala dosa - Served on request – small and tasty, with pretty niggard masala stuffing

(x)	Gathiya papri with papaya bhurji – a winner – a great side item with tea

(xi)	Masala tea – a big thanks to the Guptas for a masala tea of this calibre – served on request – in mud kulhads – a perfectly happy ending to a good meal!

Ambience of the place is pretty average – and diners inside create a huge hue and cry. Since this buffet breakfast is offered only on Sundays, you might have a difficult time finding a seat!

Moving on, a major turn off was the Management attitude. Food containers were getting depleted pretty soon, but were not being refilled so duly! Waiting time is pretty high and at times, you might not feel the need to carry on with your plate! Again, the cup sizes are so small, they can hardly accommodate any serving of sabji, sambhar or chutney – same for the tea kulhads! Again, the plate itself is so heavy, you can’t hold it for even a minute – and all the aspects combined, you lose appetite for breakfast. On top of that, they refuse to serve you any extra plates!

I do understand that the management is running a low cost buffet, and they look forward to minimize cost and wastage, but they should rather focus on maintaining a good quality buffet and at the same time increase prices – to remain in profit!

I hereby rate them 4.5 – 1 (for attitude) = 3.5

The place is right behind the bata showroom near quest mall. Since my mother is a strict  vegetarian ,  we decided to give it a shot.  

The onion rawa dosa was decent,  tad too oily, but not bad to eat. 

We ordered a dahi Wada,  which when first came,  was not even finished.  Then on returning it, he gave one which was proper.  

We ordered a tea and fresh lime soda.  The lime soda arrived  fast,  but he forgot the tea I guess,  and it came even after the food.  

The food is strictly average.  Service can improve a bit

This place located near Bata opposite Quest Mall. This pure vegetarian eatery has a couple of sections in including banquet, sweet shop and food court.

The food court serves multi cuisine food.
My recommendations here would definitely be the Thalis and chats. The rest of the food is not bad but the Indian flavour is dominant.

We ordered:
The Chinese Bhel
Crispy chilli baby corn
And papdi chat
The chat  we ordered was good. The Chinese bhel and baby corn were a little too sweet.

 We got Thalis packed for home. The food in them was very nice and tasteful. Only the cucumber in the salad was giving an overbearing smell because of the heat of the veggies . And the seera/ halwa in the dessert was quite tasteless. But otherwise the food was good. The  Indian vegetables were really good. Would like to reorder the thali sometime soon

Shudh is a pure veg and multicuisine food eatery which is quite small if you are terming it as a "Food Court".It is divided into two sections,one is "Gupta sweets" and other is this eatery.Now coming to the other segements-

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is quite calm.The interiors are very basic and is decorated with white and green color which looks like a food court.It also has a good seating capicity but not as huge to be termed as "Food Court"

Service-The service at this place was quite good.The staff also was extremely cooperative but still need a slight improvement in food serving speed.

Food-The food at this place was quite good.They serve pure vegetarian dishes in variety of cuisines.We had-
1:Paper Dosa
2:Fried rice
3:Blue heaven
4:Chinese Bhel

All the dishes were quite good in taste and was served fresh.

Food-3.5/5
Service-3.5/5

Location: Ballygunge, close to quest mall. It is located in the lane beside Bata showroom. It is on the ground floor and as well as the first floor. For those who travels on uber and cannot find this restaurant, you can type in "shack lounge" to get the most accurate information.

Design and other information: once you enter, the outside room has Gupta brothers sweets and the inside one has a room for shudh. This ground floor restaurant provides dosa and other food. On the second floor, they deserve thalis as well as the food that you get on the first floor. Now, the interior designing in the first floor looks a bit casual, using the colors of green and white. It actually looks like that of a food court. However, when you enter the 2nd floor, it looks completely different. It has drapes in maroon colour and the servers were dressed in a royale way. Very beautiful.

Food: we ordered for two rajasthani thali and i, havent actually tried any rajasthani, gujarati or punjabi thali before, was a bit reluctant to eat. So i ordered for a plain masala dosa. Unfortunately, i cannot give much details on the food they served for the thalis but it tasted pretty good. We were welcomed with chaas and we had complimentary desserts. Overall, food was really good.

Ratings: i really liked everything about this restaurant. It is pocket friendly and a good place to have a healthy veg food. 4.0/5.0

I was very sceptical about ordering online as im a visitor in Kolkata. The food arrived is good packaging. I ordered Raj Kachori & Idly. Raj kachori just tasted yumm. The only thing is, it became a lil soggy cos of the curd in it. But hey it was delivery so that had to happen. Idly were neither too big nor too small. Size about 3 inches. But it was delivered hot. The sambhar & chutney were good. Chutney was thick n made of cocunut, unlike some places use Chana Atta for making chutney. Overall im pleased. And yeh the delivery was fast as well.

Good ambience.. Located near Quest Mall.. Food quality is good.. Service is little slow and since we were 15 people they were a little more slower in responding to us. The waiters were to be called twice or thrice atleast to place any order.. We ordered Aloo Do Piaza, Dal Makhni, Methi Matar Malai, and Malai Kofta. Also Mexican Green Wave and Country Special Pizza. Pizzas are okay and north indian food is okay too. Would recommend Dal Makhni and Aloo Do Piaza. Paneer Tikka was the only thing available in starters so we had to order that, but it was amazing. Lemon Coriander soup should also be tried. Overall I rate 4 out of 5 because of average service and okay food taste .

Its more of a upscale Indian Cafe, serving a wide variety to cuisines. Right from north Indian to Italian they have good mix of offering for the public.
Good food, good ambience and very polite servers make your whole dining experience feel very premium as compared to their very seasonable prices.
Tried a quite a few items there during my 3 visits, and they always delivered quality food.
Some must try's would be the Paper Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Sizzler, Hydrabadi Biryani and my personal favorite the Vada Pav.

This place will be in my go to places.
Go , munch and enjoy your weekend.

Its more of a upscale Indian Cafe, serving a wide variety to cuisines. Right from north Indian to Italian they have good mix of offering for the public.
Good food, good ambience and very polite servers make your whole dining experience feel very premium as compared to their very seasonable prices.
Tried a quite a few items there during my 3 visits, and they always delivered quality food.
Some must try's would be the Paper Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Sizzler, Hydrabadi Biryani and my personal favorite the Vada Pav.

Never ever order food online. Meals (Thalis) ordered were delivered more than one hour late from scheduled time. 
Packing was absolutely poor. Trays were flimsy. Sealing atrocious. We had to use a knife to pry open the sheet.
Naan became inedible. Every thing else cold. Except for paneer sabji and rice, every thing else was tasteless.

This place is located near quest mall in the lane next to bata. The ambiance is good and the place looks spacious and has courteous staff. 

We ordered for chilly mushroom, idli, jhaal farezi, chana masala, masala kulcha for main course.

The chilly mushroom was crisp, spicy and nicely prepared. The idli was good but could be a little softer. I really liked the masala kulcha. It was hot with good portion of butter. The jhaal farezi was spicy, true to its name and the chana masala reminded me of the chola i used to absolutely love in delhi.

We ordered for dessert and had their caramel custard , kiwi jalebi and some other dish that i cant recall. The jalebi was the best and was really yummy. It was crisp, freshly prepared and very tasty.

The pocket pinch for 2 here would be around 400 which is really cheap compared to the quality of the food that is served. Its a totally value for money place and a must visit for vegetarians.

A Pure Vegetarian Restaurant not exactly a restaurant but sort of food Court.  Where you get every thing and anything. The Cream o fMushroom soup and the kebab Platter ( assorted kebabs 2 pcs each) is very good. They serve north indian thalis and Chinese combos also. HotPot was not upto the mark with too much of oil and it seemed as indian version of pasta.

I was recently on a vacation to Kolkata. I am a vegan and was looking for a place where I can have descent vegetarian food. I came to know about this place from one of my colleague. I visited this place on a weekday, they have a welcoming and well trained staff, also  the place was neat and calm, people looking for hygienic restaurants should surely visit this one. Usually in food courts there is a self service system but here people were served well by the waiters.
              
                It was my first time so I was unaware what would be the best, then I asked for suggestions from them, the manager himself came and suggested me few items, I was served well all with a smile and yes the food did stood upto my expectation. Paneer tikka masala, dal makhani, and tandoori kulcha were amazing, the thing I liked the most was the chinese bhel, it had a chinese flavour with an Indian twist. Overall an overwhelming experience, will surely be visiting again on my next trip to Kolkata☺

The only flaw is their confused service , else it definitely stands out in almost all aspects.

This is one of our favorite restaurant. It serves great food and I have been here many time with friends. Since my friends wants to eat veg we prefer pure veg restaurants. I have taken Maharaja Thali and I go for north Indian. The ambiance is very good . Lots of variety in sudh veg court, North Indian , Pizza or South Indian are also available.

Does this outlet really belong to the Gupta Brother's stable or is associated with Gupta Brother's in any way? If yes then I'm astounded( Gupta Brothers reputation will be ruined beyond repair). Soda sikhanji was not sweet,when we complained they brought hot sugar syrup ( Chaasni..in Hindi ) in a bowl!! Well hey..Hot!! Couldn't believe our eyes!! The service too wasn't up to the mark.( waiters were generally clueless). The vada Pav was good as was the Pizza we ordered. Also the papri chaat was good. But.....in the evening they couldn't serve tea! Hey it's tea time! ( their lame excuse that the person making tea wasn't there..What a joke!! You need an expert chef to make tea!!! ) Moreover they also didn't have any sweets ( What? Gupta Brothers are known for their s

weets). They had sweet counters just after entering the restaurant before the seating area starts. But the counter were bare...empty. On enquiry we were told that they hadn't made up their minds as yet what to serve from these counters. They need to make up their minds pronto and pull their act together!

_------_--------------------------_--------------------_------------------------

Visited this joint again and found that most of my concerns in my previous visit had been addressed. The waiters were up to the mark.  The food of course in the first visit had also been good and so too was it now. They could serve us tea in the afternoon and it was good tea. Satisfying. The counters in the outer room were filled with Sweets.....A la Gupta Brother's. 
This time..... According to this experience my rating would definitely be higher than the previous one.....Where points had been reduced due to certain concerns. But those concerns have been addressed. So my rating would be 4. ( But still this is the subsequent one the first one was given based on that experience as stated in the review then)

Located in a lane near Bata opp. to Quest Mall, many find it difficult to locate but it was pretty easy for me to reach there. Having visited all there individual eateries, Shudh is a  multi-cuisine food court different by regular food courts as they stand by 'Self-Service', but this place have waiters  to serve you. 
Now coming to the food have tried the North Indian & Chaats over here. Both were pretty amazing and quite different in taste from their other outlets.
It is a must try for all veg lovers and a family crowd.
P.S: They have a large tv setup for all cricket match-ups

I was struggling to decide whether to give this place a 3.5 or a 3. The food is slightly above average with the exception of the pizza. A variety cuisine such as that of Shudh( North Indian, Chinese, etc) initially gives one a comparison to Haldiram, but the staff here is ill trained. Also quite a few of the items on the menu are unavailable. If you want something filling quick, then it's fine, but don't expect much from the staff or the ambience. As mentioned previously however, the pizza is outstanding.

It was a mistake going to Shudh Veg food Court.
Quality of food was really bad. Everything was served cold. Upon repeated request about the same, the management and the waiters were least bothered.. The waiters don't know what food they are serving... they don't know how to serve, dropping food again and again on clothes while serving was way too irritating...

I had visited this place recently. The food is one of the best and specialises in South-Indian dishes. The reception is good and service is as you may expect from a reputed/popular restaurant. An excellent Veg-Court justifying it's name itself. I highly recommend this place if one wants to enjoy the food as well as the environment inside. Among hundreds of restaurants in & outside Kolkata, Shudh can be counted as one of many best restaurants I ever visited.

Dosa was nothing extraordinary but i liked their thali. The panner was nice.Butter nan was well cooked so was alu ki sabzi.Gulab jamun was very tasty.

This is near beck bagan bata, opposite khosla electronic near quest mall. No bike parking available, there is space inside but only for employees though. Ordered cheese masala dosa which hardly has cheese in it. The masala was not properly cooked, Potato n peas. There is nothing good here. Staffs are not well mannered. Cold drinks prices are not mentioned in the menu, and the staff doesn't know either. they went back twice to check the price. They also provided me the wrong info, then once the bill came the price of the cold drink was wrongly quoted. When I protested they blamed entirely on me and the waiter lied with a straight face. They were not ready to accept their mistake. The manager said he can't make mistake since he is working for so long . strange the person working for so long doesn't even know the price. When I refused to pay extra, they did change the bill without being courteous, however I left the amount they asked for in the first place. Disgusting place , really disgusting. Will never visit even if someone treats me...

Well firstly I must say that I went to Shudh with absolutely no expectations after reading the reviews here.But, a friend insisted that the food is good so we visited this place on Dhanteras day.Well the first look said that the place is a no frills one but with a clean and modern look.
Upon ordering,the food was served in time.
We had ordered a chilli babycorn for appetisers with pudina paratha,Kali dal and Paneer butter masala for main course.

The babycorn was above average.Though it was a bit Indianised,but I liked the flavour.It was medium spicy.
However the main disappointment was the main course.The food was extremely greasy and though people expect it in such restaurants,the flavour was nothing to ride home about too.The main course was just average.
The Kali daal had no particular flavour which could be distinguished.

The essence of pudina in the paratha really wasnt coming out.It tasted somehwat like a normal paratha.
During the meal,the waiter asked us whether we would like any breads as the kitchen would close soon,so we asked for tandoori rotis.He came back after a minute and said that the kitchen is already closed.How can you close the kitchen without asking for a last order? Then he served us with tava rotis saying that was the only bread they could make now.

This sort of service would never get you repeat customers,please mend your ways.
Also,you need to work on the food,I am not coming back here until I see rave reviews about this place in the future.

Hair in the food, waiter doesn't know what's fresh lime, alu dum contains onions and tomatoes let alone potatoes and rude staff. 

So this is how I would sum up Shudh Veg Food Crappy restaurant.  Visited this place with family and came back home with an empty stomach. Extremely oily food. Shahi Paneer has more of water in the gravy rather than what actually should be there. Complete waste of money. Eating road side food is probably ten times better than spending money here. 

I'm probably giving it a 1 because Zomato doesn't allow me to post a review without rating it. 

A complete no!

Gupta Brothers is spoiling its image with this new venture.

This place don't even deserve a rating. If there is anything less than zero then I want to rate it with that digit. An awful experience at this place last week. To start with the negatives after I entered the restaurant I realized the ACs are not switched on and they have put 2 large standing fans which is so full of aur that the napkins on the table were flying here and there. The waiters are extremely unskilled and untrained they don't know even how to serve or how to communicate with the customers.. Last but not the least I would write a few words about the food well I ordered a plate of chilli garlic noodles and chilli baby corn, the noodle tasted very different and it dint even taste like a Chinese food. The baby corn was relatively OK but all in all this restaurant doesn't fall under my list of preference.

Sunday morning breakfast time....the newly opened veg restaurent opposite Quest Mall.

Will write in short....

Taste 4 points.
Ambiance 4 points
Service 2 points
Price 4 points

Today's visit was even more bad. 

Today mornong 8 am. 

Poorest service. Completely confused service. Did not note down what we ordered. During final bill making, we told him everything we ordered and eat. And finally he passed a comment, which basically meant that we have reduced the quantity of food we ordered so that final bill amount is less that what it should be. 

We were Group of 17 odd people. 

 Hope the Management noticed this and teaches its restaurant manager some manners and etiquette.

Visited this place last Sunday over a family lunch with a group of 10 and 2 kids.. The ambience have the traditional feel to it which i really liked.. it serves u thali from the states like rajasthan , gujrat and punjab.. everything from starters till deserts.. u can also go for a-la-carte and other paw bhaji and stuff.. we ordered 4 rajasthani.. 3 gujrati and 3 punjabi thali and then shared and ate whatever we liked from the three so there were soo many options to choose from.. my personal favourite was the punjabi thali.. which was yumm especially paneer and dal makhni.. rest two didn't impress me much (personal choice) i liked the strawberry dhokla and mini kachoris that were served as starters ! But what i didn't like is the service which was really slow.. i hope the management works on it !!
Overall a good option for vegetarians to visit in families.. also its not very expensive !!
Looking forward to the next time :)

A new discovery!
Heard about it from a friend and went on to check it out. Relatively new on the blocks just ahead of Mithai(opp. Quest mall).
Beatiful interiors and affordable food sum up the initial feel of the place. The food is quite lyk the nearby Haldiram's exception being u get a lot of variety here (its a Gupta bros initiative so u can smell the competition). U also get unlimited thali options one floor above at Suruchi.
All in all a nice place if u want more options wen it comes to affordable veg food of gud quality. A nice cheap retreat from the nearby overly expensive Quest. Recommend the place to have better trained staff to take orders.

The moment you enter, you are attacked with bright colors all over in the ground floor restaurant. With orange dressed men all around, it becomes a little too much. The place is not anything exciting. The ambience is sad and full of very unpleasant crowd. 

First things first, the paneer tikka served to me was broken and not properly cut. The fresh lime soda was not fresh as I got soda without the fizz even after replacing the first one. Ordered for salted soda, and it was as if I was having sea water.

Ridiculous service standard and presentation, serious let down. Very average North Indian food. Improper taste, guess they need to change the chef. Either too salty or very little.

Reserve my opinion for the Thalis until I try them - don't know if I will anytime soon though. 

Serious letdown to what I was looking forward for.

I have visited this place twice and both times my last item which I used to order turned out to be worst. The ambience is good nothing exciting average one can say. service is very slow ...be prepared either to sit and wait or to keep a track by continously asking the waiters. And dont try their dahi bhallas it's yucks. .no salt no pepper no green chutney n slight mitha chutney given n worst thing saw that they have added curry leaves and rai in it . Even moong dal halwa was worst. Tomato soup is good. Dry chilli paneer I tired it was good but too much of garlic was added in it. Overall okayish experience. .they should improve a bit more to grab the crowd.

My review is for the Suruchi Thali restaurant on the first floor. They serve Gujarati, Rajasthani & Punjabi thalis here. 

Ambiance : The walls are clean, the decor is new and the tables and utensils are clean

Service : The service for the Thali meals is prompt, my experience was that the food served was piping hot

Taste : The Gujarati thali was tasty, the farsaan was nice, so were the main dishes. The Rajasthani thali was also well cooked. The Punjabi thali was average though.

Overall Feedback : If you like pure vegetarian food, and authentic Gujarati or Rajasthani or Punjabi fare, this is a good place to be. I liked the concept of unlimited thali including the sweets, which can be accompanied by as many glasses of butter milk that you like.

However on a recent visit I was a little disappointed.There was no butter milk in the menu, this is usually a normal fare at Suruchi. There was dahi vada but no butter milk. So i would request the team from the restaurant to include butter milk regardless of whether there is dahi vada or not. 

Also there should be two farsan s always especially on weekends. Another feedback is that the vegetables should be served steaming hot. Another feedback is to always include puri in the breads as an option. 

Overall 

Punjabi Thali - Average
Gujarati Thali - Good
Rajasthani Thali - Good

I would go with 4/5 for Suruchi Restaurant. Recommended.

Yesterday I had the misfortune of visiting this horrible place with my family. The service is pathetic and the staff ill-mannered , irresponsible and careless. Even their manager didn't care much despite repeated complaining. After waiting for a long time the waiter came to take our order. We ordered soup and dahi ke kabab for starters. They served soup and then we waited for half an hour for dahi ke kabab to arrive. When we enquired about the delay , another waiter came to inform that dahi ke kabab is not available. We ordered another paneer starter which again took them eternity to serve. All this while the manager kept mum without giving two hoots to the customer's complains. The food was below average. Paneer malai tikka was just raw paneer dipped in the marinate and served. It was bland with a capital B. Similarly other dishes like malai kofta (with 3 pieces of kofta instead of 4) and dal makhni were below par. NEVER EVEN VISIT THIS PATHETIC PLACE AGAIN.

Horrible experience............ It was a disaster taking my family out......... Service was pathetic, staff was not responsive- they dint even serve a glass of water, the food was the worst part it was half cooked, the mushrooms in Mushroom Masala were raw.
Please change your chefs, service people or the whole management to save the brand name of Gupta Brothers.

I have visited this place twice and both times my last item which I used to order turned out to be worst. The ambience is good nothing exciting average one can say. service is very slow ...be prepared either to sit and wait or to keep a track by continously asking the waiters. And dont try their dahi bhallas it's yucks. .no salt no pepper no green chutney n slight mitha chutney given n worst thing saw that they have added curry leaves and rai in it . Even moong dal halwa was worst. Tomato soup is good. Dry chilli paneer I tired it was good but too much of garlic was added in it. Overall okayish experience. .they should improve a bit more to grab the crowd.

My review is for the Suruchi Thali restaurant on the first floor. They serve Gujarati, Rajasthani & Punjabi thalis here. 

Ambiance : The walls are clean, the decor is new and the tables and utensils are clean

Service : The service for the Thali meals is prompt, my experience was that the food served was piping hot

Taste : The Gujarati thali was tasty, the farsaan was nice, so were the main dishes. The Rajasthani thali was also well cooked. The Punjabi thali was average though.

Overall Feedback : If you like pure vegetarian food, and authentic Gujarati or Rajasthani or Punjabi fare, this is a good place to be. I liked the concept of unlimited thali including the sweets, which can be accompanied by as many glasses of butter milk that you like.

However on a recent visit I was a little disappointed.There was no butter milk in the menu, this is usually a normal fare at Suruchi. There was dahi vada but no butter milk. So i would request the team from the restaurant to include butter milk regardless of whether there is dahi vada or not. 

Also there should be two farsan s always especially on weekends. Another feedback is that the vegetables should be served steaming hot. Another feedback is to always include puri in the breads as an option. 

Overall 

Punjabi Thali - Average
Gujarati Thali - Good
Rajasthani Thali - Good

I would go with 4/5 for Suruchi Restaurant. Recommended.

Yesterday I had the misfortune of visiting this horrible place with my family. The service is pathetic and the staff ill-mannered , irresponsible and careless. Even their manager didn't care much despite repeated complaining. After waiting for a long time the waiter came to take our order. We ordered soup and dahi ke kabab for starters. They served soup and then we waited for half an hour for dahi ke kabab to arrive. When we enquired about the delay , another waiter came to inform that dahi ke kabab is not available. We ordered another paneer starter which again took them eternity to serve. All this while the manager kept mum without giving two hoots to the customer's complains. The food was below average. Paneer malai tikka was just raw paneer dipped in the marinate and served. It was bland with a capital B.

Horrible experience...half of the menu wasn't avaliable....service pathetic...staff not responsive...the best reason given was 'Sir there is a party going on upstairs...so we short on staff...' They are so busy that even when you are leaving no one comes up..
My advice of you don't have enough staff please shut down the place don't spoil the brand name of gupta brothers...
Sorry guys forgot the best part the place is also full of mosquitos..so you can play with them the best thing you can do as you wait for the person to turn up and take your order...our even serve you water..
Hats off to the place and management...go at your own risk...
