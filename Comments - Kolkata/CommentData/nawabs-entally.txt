Though small, it's a well decorated and well maintained place. Walking distance from Maula Ali crossing...we went there for lunch. And we were very hungry! Had butter nun, chicken bharta and chicken reshmi butter masala. The best thing about the food is it is very healthy and not too spicy! And pocket pinch is comfortable too.. We were pretty satisfied with the service too.

With its location close to my place I frequently go for its biryani and the range of kebabs. The ambiance is also good for small bites like chicken roll but the service was a little late. Other than that they provided the kulcha with much stuffing and the roasted kebabs were good too. The quantity of chicken bharta was also commendable.

Cutting 1 point for COLD BIRYANI served.

That was highly unprofessional to serve chilled biryani as if it was directly from fridge. We complained and the management said sorry, but damage had already been done !

We ordered :-
Achaari fish : (2.5/5)they said fish festival is going on. Hence we ordered. Not bad though

Palak paneer :(2.5/5)

Chicken bharta:(4/5)

Mutton bhuna(3/5)

Mutton special biryani :(0/5) this was waste of money. This item was cold. And the egg was colder than biryani. It was chilled like came out of fridge. This thing spoiled my whole mood. Never coming back.

Butter naan(3.5/5)

Plain naan(3.5/5)

Salad(3/5)

Firni.(3/5)

P.S : other food are good except biryani. But if you order biryani, do remind them to bring it hot.

Excellent chicken biryani. Good quantity. Not at all greasy. Got a huge potato.  The cheese chicken kebabs were succulent. It was a takeaway order , hence cannot write about the ambience.

This place is one of the best restaurant in that area..Went there for some work with my buddy and while we were returning we grasped two rolls from their outlet..The egg chicken kabab roll that I had was excellent, specially the Kababs were delicious..The ambiance was very good and sitting arrangements outside was well maintained too..

This food joint opened right before the Durga Puja near my neighbourhood. It is a small food joint at Entally, very well decorated, air-conditioned restaurant. The interior was pretty impressive. I coudn't visit this place during the pujas due to the huge rush. Coming on to the part of food items I would say that it is a pocket friendly restaurant affordable for everyone and the food items were really very tasty. It was my first visit to d restaurant today, I tried out fried and steam momos and chicken hakka noddles and I must say that each item was worth the money. Momos were really tasty as well as the noodle. Service was fast and good. Its a place where i would definitely want to visit quite a number of times, more often as its just a walking distance from my house.I would definitely like to try the mughal dishes on my next visit. I would rate this restaurant a 4 out of 5.

All the items we have ordered tasted good, especially the chicken bharta was very tasty. Shall be visiting the restaurant once again for trying out the other items on offer. The cheese nan we ordered did not have to have much cheese in it.. But the chicken bharta was a clear winner !

The Biriyani was the worst Biriyani ever I tasted!  The rice was too stiff..  As Biriyani should be oily,  we couldnt felt the ghee or oil anything..  Totally time waste or money waste..  Chicken tikka kebabs were better than the Biriyani but it wasn't tasty at all..
