I have been there only once as I had to pick my wife from a nearby office where she used to work. I had to wait for 30 mins so thought of utilizing the time. Located just beside the Chinar park spencers, this place is really not at all recommended as nothing is special about the place. Waiters are not courteous, food is not fresh, alcohol rates are too high compared to the amenities and standard provided. Spcially after sunset, the loud sound with girls dancing with ultra make up and voluptuous indications, some "boro-bajar" seths with gold chains and rings drop in there to give away money on them - you actually won't be able to tolerate for long.

Actually this is a dance bar which I and my colleague were not aware off. Food was okay but the surrounding was not. We just finished our food and left.

We went in by mistake, looking for a pub. And were greeted with girls from Calcutta - 5 dancing to rash bollywood songs. The waiters were rude and the bouncers try to throw you out every now and then if you are ordering slow. Bad experience.
