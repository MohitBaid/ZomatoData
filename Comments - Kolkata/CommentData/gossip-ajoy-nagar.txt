Decent place. Had a couple of pegs with colleagues.  Soft music was played. Order was serviced within time.  Parking of car was no issue due to the space in front of Unnayan commercial complex.

Probably the darkest bar I ever visited. I mean I can't even read what on the menu. They serve quick food is ok. The place is little too small to my opinion.¬†

Location:situated in the 1st floor of unnayan complex in ajaynagar just above khawab.
Staffs and ambience:the place is small but real comfort and cosy one.. something that dis heartened me was the staffs.the staffs stare in an unusual and weird manner.. especially the way they were starting at all the other girls there and even had the most distrbing eye contact with me several times.this is to be noted immediately and changed.
Food:this is something that was too good..had chkn Reshmi kebab(pieces were well barinated and too tender,and even the sizes we're pleasing), tandoori roti (perfectly made),chkn bharta(this was good too)
A nice place that has reasonably priced drinks and a bit over priced delicious food but the staffs behavior let it all down

This place is very convenient. The ambience is quite good. Service is also very good. Food quality is average. Behavior of some stuff is very poor, not everyone though. But don't ever order pan fried noodles here. They have their own recipe I guess. They put a gravy on top of the pan fried noodles. I was disgusted when I was served with a kind of gravy noodles & they represented it as Pan fried. They must learn to serve proper food.

The ambience is very calm. A very good collection of songs.
The starters are awesome. We ordered chicken tikka kebabs, beer batter fried fish, crispy pan fried chicken and crispy pan fried lamb.
From alcohol we order vodka, white rum, whiskey and beer pitcher.
Egg hakka chow and lamb in hot garlic sauce.
The ambience was great with friends, cricket, songs, great food and alcohol.

Located beside Eastern metropolitan bypass at Ajaynagar just on the upper floor of Arambagh... The place is nicely decorated and carries a dark theme... we ordered the Chicken Fried Rice along with chicken in hot garlic sauce... Food was good and tasty... Drinks are available at reasonable rate... A 650ml Budweiser Magnum Beer costs 265 INR only...

We checked zomato and found that this place serves draught beer. 
First of all there is a space crunch. Next we were told by the waiter that there is no draught beer. That was a major turn off. However we settled with Budweiser. The tables are so small that no two person can keep their plates on the table and eat peacefully. 
The place that we got was just beside the washroom and a leaky AC. We asked them to change our place after we saw a vacant table. But they didn't allow us over there, instead allotted it to a different couple. We ordered for tandoori chicken which was okay. Served with green pudina chutney. 
The overall experience was bad. Maybe the place we got was the biggest turn off.

I visited this place 3 times..last on  yesternght..
Well my impression after my couple of visit there was like..m not likely to come here again.. simply bcoz value for money is not at all justified
There are a lot of resto pubs which serves better food yes..I mean it..than gossip
U get a lot of options ..particularly starters,both in veg & non veg..they taste average(not unpalatable though),but are priced like premium restaurants!
We ordered 1 stuffed vetki fish,prawn tandoori & roasted lamb..only the vetki was really delicious,others tasted kind of ok..or may be even below expectation
They charges avg 400 for a dish(vat extra)& 250 for foster strong beer( again vat extra)..
Service was good though,ambience above average particularly if u sit in the gossip segment rather than more gossip segment
Moreover the gateman of gossip behaved rather unprofessionally with my wife
There only advantage is they are the only one of its kind in ajaynagar..so people have no choice but to go there
 Had gossip been situated in areas like park Street they would struggle to make customers with this price tag..but with average food

Located on the 1st floor of Udita Complex, this Resto Pub offers rightly priced alcohol and quality food options. 

A great place to spend evening over a few drinks and one of it's kind in this area.

Though its predominantly a Bar but serves lip-smacking starters. 
The best part was the speed of the service. We got our orders within 10 short minutes ! 

Nice ambience, not very fancy but still cozy and comfortable seating arrangement with some old nos. playing in the background. After 18:00 hrs they just turn off lights; its nice and peaceful.¬† 

Overall a good place for a hangout. They have just a few tables; either book your table or be early. From my side its a thumbs up üëç

I used to be a regular at Gossip, Ajaynagar and used to love the place. Today's experience was very disheartening for me and my husband. The place is teeming with cockroaches!! It's unhygienic to say the least!! One of those pests was right on our table. When we informed the staff l, they were extremely casual about it. When we asked for the manager, they told us he's out. Gossip is not a roadside eatery with cheap food, it's quite expensive. It is absolutely wrong to not get proper pest control for a proper resto-pub. If this is the quality that they are providing, I would strongly advice against going there.

Very nice ambience actually...food quality is also superb..service is also very nice...
We ordered prawn ball and one beer fish item,I forgot the exact name,sry...both were superb...yes,we also took a scotch whisky..price is also reasonable..I become fond of this restaurant,I will surely revisit this place...

Finally visited GOSSIP. It's LOCATED at the first floor of Unnayan Complex, a few mins walking distance from Ajay Nagar. Find the Arambagh Food Mart & a few step ahead you will get the staircase to reach your destination.

AMBIENCE is nice and cozy, staff are also good. But we had no option but to sit near the door and that place is pretty annoying and disturbing.

DRINKS & FOOD were also good. PAN FRIED CHILI FISH was truly nice. SEX ON THE BEACH satisfied mind as well as it touched my heart ( wanna have it again).

At a first glance it is quiet sure to miss this place, but following google map it would be easier. Located in the first floor of the building (just beside arambagh) the seating area is divided in two separate sections which is unusual.
Coming to interior the place has been given a very rustic look accommodating few people in each section which made it look crowded few times.
For the drinks we went for signature, blenders pride & smirnoff,
While for the food we had Roasted Lamb, Cinnamon Fried Rice, Hakka Noodles & Chicken in hot garlic sauce.
The food quality was moderate but the usp of the place is the price it charges, a very budget delivery place to be found in zomato.
P.S. Choose the right section for seating it gives a good view with good interior.

Been going there since college. Nothing has changed. The decor, the food, the service is still good. And the people there know me and my friends so we never have to wait too long for an order to come to our table. The music though, has deteriorated. They used to play Floyd and Nirvana earlier. Now it's "Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai". They do change it on request though.

Try the Lasauni Tikka Kebab and the Chicken Satay.

Go for the ambience. The lights are just perfect.

Not a very big place, but pleasant enough to meet up with friends or siblings to have a drink or two. Service is speedy and their non veg preparations are a little on the oily side but that can be overlooked. Crispy Chilly Baby Corn always on my list of favourites. Cheers to Gossip!

The only good thing is the ambience though the lighting is too dim. I was really embarrassed as whatever we wanted to order they said it's not available. Starting from beer to prawn they didn't have it. We went around 12pm and they said it's already over. Somehow we managed as we were very hungry. So, we ordered mixed Hakka noodles which was average and the Fish Picada was also average as the fish was not fried properly. For me it was a first and last visit to Gossip.

Decent but clumsy
Okay okay but a bit on pricy side for foods (drinks are almost reasonable) 
Totally for beer lovers. Have a pitcher, get some starter and just gossip thats it (I wont suggest taking risk for food, go for tandoori chicken or kebabs)

Ajoy Nagar has too many restaurants, snack corner, food station, from one those is Gossip.
 Its located at the 1st Floor and it is a small pub come restaurant. 
Light was too low so we haven't seen any deco. Ambiance was nice and they played really nice tracks or musics.
#Drinks
Cosmopolitan is one of best thing I had in Irish house it was quite different in here. Very mild flavour..

Devil's Vodka is one of the spicy drinks I was ever had. Liked the taste.

#Food
Pan Fried chilli fish tasted good, portion size was perfect. They use Bekti fish instead of Basa. That's a good thing. Coating of the fish needs to be softer in my opinion. 

Mixed Gravy Chowmien was quite average. They used rice noodles on that. 

Service was satisfactory.

Nice ambience with a very good service , have been a regular customer over here and the one thing that attracts me over here again and again is there service , they listen to any complaints if there is any , like yesterday we felt that the starter which we took was a bit rubbery , they immediately changed it , the price is in the average range , overall a good place to hangout !!!!

Good option to have quick drinks! They offer cheese bites with the drinks which is nice! Prices for drinks ate reasonable! Only issue is food quantity is not much and not that tasty! Since you don't have good bar option nearby so, you can opt for this one! Ambiance is nice bit dark which some may like!

A very nice place to spend an evening with friends over drinks and good food.
The menu is classic.
It has all you can want. Dishes are prepared in a confident and simple way.
Service is great and complements the food.
The have a good collection of spirits as well.
Best thing of all I think is the decor and the ambiance of the place.
it just makes you feel very comfortable and cozy.
Had a great experience here with a couple of my friends .

A great place to spend a lovely evening over a few drinks and one of it's kind in this area. The location is great and easily accessible. The ambience is nice - not very fancy, but still cosy and comfortable seating arrangements. Staff and service - Not too bad. But the food wasn't as per expectation and could be a lot better for the price. At best, the quality is average. I personally find the alcohol & food tad bit overpriced and not a great value for money, but definitely worth spending an evening or two with friends and try to stick to finger foods. I personally somehow liked More Gossip (next door ) better in terms of service & quality.

This is the only place on em bypass ajoynagar for boozing with friends. Its quite a decent place though there is one more outlet situated just opposite, called more gossip. Ambience is Mediterranean, After 6 they just turn off lights. Its nice and peaceful. Last day was my 3rd visit. We four friends went there for some nice catch up session and Draught beer is all we had. We had crispy chicken n some new chicken preparation which they have recently added to menu. ( sorry forgot the name). Crispy chicken was so crisp that we hardly could taste any chicken. The other dish was same where chicken had lost it tenderness. On our previous visits also something similar happened with food. So according to the price they charge its not at all justified. Otherwise staff n service of drinks have no complaints. Also last day no other brand of beer was available apart from kingfisher. So overall since we had lack of time last day we had to choose this place for beer and gossip.

Gossip is a good place for enjoying finger food and snacks with drinks. Not a place you want to go if you are looking for a proper dinner. Starters are good (both Chinese and kababs) but Indian main courses items are better avoided.

Though it is predominantly a bar but heard that it¬† serves lip-smacking food also, it was in my wish list for long time, finally managed to taste their food and its really lip-smacking. Ordered via swiggy app so can't comment on ambiance or staff behaviour but food arrived within 50 mins as promised by swiggy. Ordered some of their signature dishes like chicken rozali kabab, chef's special mutton roast along with common items like fish malai kabab, malai kofta, masala kulchas etc. All of them were too good, quantity was generous, quality top notch, special mention goes to mutton roast, such wonderful melt in the mouth mutton roast is difficult to get anywhere. Though the price is little on the higher side but quality and quantity will make up for that. Had a delightful gastronomic experience today and hoping to taste their other items in near future..

Everything over there is just perfect. Food quality is excellent, ambiance is awesome, staffs are great, environment is just great and last but not the least excellent interior design. Best place to hangout with friends and family. ¬†Whenever I got time I visit this place alone or maybe with friends or maybe with my wife. I love the range of foods over there and taste is very good. And every staff over there is just like a friend, no one need to worry about anything after entering the place. specially at the time of matches either it be football or cricket you will just love it watching matches in this place with glass of beer in hand.¬†
My ultimate place for refreshment and may be it can be yours also. Just go once and visit the place I am sure you will get a BURP, as it's a BURP CERTIFIED PUB.............

location is good, ambience was nice. the main lounge was well decorated & the lounge area was well organised, cozy. graphitti on pillars, quotations & themes on the wall were really cool & unique. the bar counter was decorated with gears, nuts, bolts & machines. but the other part of lounge in same floor was much clumsy & dimmed. & i disliked the music. service was good. but availability of beer & drinks were annoying.

we ordered 2 drought pitchers, american fried chicken, chicken cheese malai kabab. we were surprised to have such an awesome taste. Especially the Chicken Cheese Malai Kabab was yummy and awesome. it costed almost 2500 INR for two of us.¬†kudos to the chef. 

will be visiting shortly :)

Once you are walking out of metropolis mall and going towards Ajoy nagar, the stretch of land consists of multiple restaurants. To my utter dismay I discovered that Gossip is the only Chinese restaurant out here.

I went to this place around the eve along with a friend. The place is darker than the eve outside and I'm too shy to ask anybody to accompany me here next time. I was so uncomfortable that I just opted for two similar dishes of dry chicken preparations.¬†

It didn't taste good and left me to wonder why would I be returning to this outlet again!

Strongly dislike!

I visited this place for a quick drink. The interior is very nicely decorated in a golden-brown combination of stuffs. The bar counter looks very interesting as it is designed as inside of some old but huge machine, decorted with gears and strings and nuts and bolts. We had ordered cocktails, tequila sunrise was a bit disappointing, as i expected it to be a bit more strong. Long island ice tea was ok, but the mix could hv been better. To lift our mood we had to order whiskey after the cocktails. We had french fries with the drink (god knows y we ordered that! :P) and even those were nt good. But i hvnt triwd their food as such..so may be i can write about that after my next visit, sometime.

another fev one is roasted lamb. boneless juicy soft lamb chops with little gravy ..its neither dry nor oily .  worth a try.

Pretty decent place for gabbing a round of drinks with your friends near ajoynagar. The day we went they didn't have draught beer only mahou light /strong available which was a bummer but we still settled in.interiors dim and cozy apt for drinking sessions.food wise their fish fingers with tartar suace is scrumptious the crispy chicken was also very good. However didn't really like jack fry fish. Overall a good place for boozing and it's total value for money.

Well well , actually very well .. Its a place where u can hav loads of fun with your friends actually ,, and it is dark, where u can hav good moments with your partner ... But , when i come to food quality its average.. But u can manage it when u r in a budget segment .. I loved the food personally .. But still some crazy, crispy touch was lagging .. Never the less now come to the behaviour aspect of the staff .. Well u hav some staff who stares u , u know what i meant .. the order was taken  quick and was ready in 15 min .. So thats a positive part ... Let me brief the atmosphere of the restaurant - well its good , not too good but ya its good .. U hav a constant low music playing on your back which provides a little classy ... U hav a small tv for those of tv lovers... U will never feel left out , there is always a sense of entertainment.. I loved the concept... Overall i feel it deserves a 4 , but i did cut a 0.5 as they don't provide a privacy option by staring , though it was dark but still... So for friends party its yes yes .. For taking your partner its yes & no both .. For family it's always a thumbs up üëç

A drizzle or 2 n full environment has changed in kolkata n I straight way headed to this foid joint for CAI PIROSKA....Who is fond of cocktails as me,please have it once. Quite amazingly they serve. Margarita is all common in all park st bars n surely it tasted better in park st for sure. We also took French kiss,that was highly recommended. For the cocktails n this drizzling weather,I rate this restaurant 7 on 10. I didn't care of any food really or ambience. Yet it was,rating 7 on 10 n food for thoda little....5. We took prawn tampura,salt n peeper chicken, normal mixed fried rice, chilli mashroom with fish salad....some sea fish n vetki n pomphret mixed. Enjoyed a lot... this thoda wintery evening in kolkata at Gossip.

My suggestion for gossip is that they should keep all the drinks they have mentioned for the happy hours on the menu because when we went there we didnt get the omes we requested on domestic drinks

Food is good too... Like barbecued chicken wings for non veg and dahi kebabs for veg.

Quite advisable visit.

Poorer of the two Gossip restopubs located opposite each other in the Unnayan Complex in Ajoy Nagar. Dimly lit like a small town bar with uncles talking loudly  while music plays softly. Apt for long hours of bakchodi over draught beer without spending too much. For a more fun time and a more happening crowd, go to 'More Gossip' next door.

One of my favourite hangouts on E. M. Bypass. I really like to chill out here on the top floor which is more of a private 'Adda' area. It's really a 'mast' place. Starters & main course are good too. But who cares for food when you have some great drinks down your throat. The place is a little heavy on the pocket though.

Really nice place situated in unnayan complex off ajoynagar. This is my second visit here. The dim lighting is the perfect backdrop for the beige and wooden decor. Hospitality is warm and prompt. Drinks menu is well stocked and moderately priced. However best part is the foods menu especially finger foods. Salt and pepper chicken is must try. Fish items are also made of good quality fresh betki. Full marks for the food. However space is a bit cramped. The couches are too low for comfort. However it's cozy and great for couples as well as stags.

Not atall a satisfactory place...
The place is only good for boozing and the decor is also good but the quality of food is not atall good like we ordered for pan fried chilly fish and it was disgusting with too much touch of garlic and chilly but yeah the waiter asked us to take one of their signature dishs which was better than average...
In short it's a kind of cheap place with very good decor but with very bad quality of food.
If you only want to booze then it's the ri8 place...

Gossip is just a walking distance from my home yet I never tried it before. Yesterday I went there with a friend. The dim lights give a cozy and intimate feeling. We went upstairs, which was trifle difficult in the dim light. The seats are comfortable. There were pictures of many famous and notorious women, including Monica Lewinsky. Why, I don't know. These would have suited in a ladies' bar, I suppose. 
Anyway, we ordered Our drinks and chicken rosalie, as suggested by the maitre de table.
We waited and waited. The rosalie was not coming, so much so that my friend summoned a staff whether they were out buying the chicken. The staff , a shy man, replied that it takes time for the kebab to be cooked. Finally in arrived. And it was worth waiting. The kebab melted in my mouth. I wished I had more of them. The drink was ok. Nice place.

I have been to gossip twice and i am quite fond of this place.  The price of liquor is quite reasonable and the the ambience is pretty good. I have tried the chicken cheese pikada and it tastes really good, apart from this, their Chinese preparations are also quite good! It's a perfect place where you can hang out with your friends, the only drawback being that the place is quite dimly lighted!

I was there on a Saturday evening. The thing that completely caught me off guard was the interiors which are way too cool. Being a football fan, the English premier league game going on TV got my attention for a long time. Beers are reasonably priced with Budweiser coming in for as cheap as 220 bucks. The starters were delicious as well. The ambiance were quite good and you can even go in with the family. Thumbs down for the lighting which was pretty poor. Overall a must visit for soccer nerds who love their Budweisers :)

This is one of the weirdest place I have ever been to. This place has serious lighting issues. Either they are the most energy conserving pub in the city or they simply don't wanna pay for electricity. Coming to the food, I found the Chesse Stuffed Fish to be really good. And I have to talk about the Tartar Sauce. It's gonna blow your mind. Imagine normal Tartar Sauce with just the correct amount of mustard in it. Pretty awesome. Overall it's a nice place. And I would like to visit it again.

Its a crazy place, good service although I have heard a few times that people have waited over 40 mins to be served. Barring that, its a happening place. Their starters are top notch. Drinks are a bit pricy. Overall a good place to drink and make merry!

If you're going there for the first time well it maybe a bit difficult for you to locate it! This bar cum restaurant is located just above Khawab restaurant in Ajoy Nagar. Well when I checked in, the ambience was what I felt for after the affordable prices of the drinks and starters. It's a nice place to be in. I had ordered two bottles of Tuborg Strong and two bottles of Corona! It was served along with cheese fries. The price is affordable so you don't need to worry on that. Cozy sofas and such nice ambience is just great! The service was great. A perfect place for "gossip" with friends!

It's a pub, not very ideal place for families.
With friends u can have gr8 fun in the dimly lit resturent. Best for couples to spend some quality time together.
The food and service was good. The quantity of food is good enough for two or may be three people.
Service is quite fast... doesn't make you wait too long..
Overall 3.5 would be a generous offering to this place...

It is a casual place for our friends to relax near my house (Garia). Been there a number if times and parking is easy on weekends ( its on the service road but paid parking and lots of place).
Nothing fancy but I recommend the place to have a little more light. I feel it is too dark and you should have enough light to see the face of your friends and not shadow outlines.
Price is reasonable. Our usual is the lamb roast which is served with egg poach on top. The lamb gravy and the egg yolk combines to give an awesome taste. We usually order two extra eggs :).
The chinese food is also not too bad.
The staff is very friendly.

The cocktails were great and the starter was mind blowing .. Loved it.. But the chicken salad was 4out of 10.. Nothing great and not cold.. 
But I think one can take friends and sit there hours to njoi the game or music with cool food and nice cocktails

Our usual hangout near Hiland Park..if u want to sit and chill after a long hard day's work..amidst dim lights and liquor..and yet keep it classy. .this is the place for you. 
Special mention for the food which is reasonable yet does not compromise with the quality and quantity. The deep fried chicken with stuffed cheese is a must try. I also remember ordering crispy chilli baby corn and not being able to finish it as the quanity was for 4 people and we were only two!! The salt was slightly on the higher side although it tasted just right along with chilled beer. Oh coming to beer..this is the first and only place where I had Miller (they had recommended it to us since it had just launched) and it came as a surprise. Not even budweiser is as light as this. I never knew that beer could be so light and smooth. So anyway..I didn't find any other place serving this heavenly drink although most had included it in their menu..so Gossip will always remain my special Miller place. The ambience is typical working crowd who stop over after office and there are contemporary soft romantic songs playing all through which gives u a heady feeling when u leave..cheers to Gossip..will be back again soon!! :)

over a pint of beer, ambiance is fair enough , the place is not that
big. We ordered fish fingers and lamb with a pitcher of beer only,
all tasted good. The thing that is good is that the price pinch is
low enough. It can be a place for occasional meet up with friends
not fair enough for some special ones.

Service was very good and they don't rush at you to finish things off. You can spend some quality time over here. Now coming to food, Cold chicken salad is my most favourite dish over here and I can easily state that this dish is one of my five best dishes that I have ever tasted in any restaurant. Though the location of this restaurant is offbeat for me, but still I shall love to visit it again soon.

Prices are a little on the higher side but given the ambience and prompt service I would say it is worth it. Privacy is one the primary things that define this place. Would have liked to visit this place more if I were living in Kolkata. Living in South Kolkata with a little money to spend on drinks and privacy? Visit Gossip!

It has an ambiance of its own, quite different from other places. Its a nice private romantic place. There are two openings just opposite one another. Ambiance wise, I like the new one better, the one on the "Bebonie" parlor side.

Ordered these stuffed fish, barbequed chicken wings, roasted lamb along with chocoloco and another chocolate mocktail. I really enjoyed their each and every starter and they were literally mouth watering. But I realised, this place is completely for drinkers. They make wacky mocktails.

Too good. You don't get such good bars in Kolkata. What makes it good?
Well, I will say that it is a very peaceful bar. Great ambiance. Truly hallucinating and dark. A wonderful crowd.¬†
Is it overpriced?¬†
Not at all. Yes, it's costly but that filters the crowd and makes it a better place to be in. You can bring your Premium or Snob guests to this place. They will love it.
And now the food..
Wonderfulllllllll!! ¬†Try the Roasted Lamb... Tooooo Good. And the beer battered fish.
Actually you can go for anything on the menu. Crispy Chilly Baby-corn. Yummy!!!
Around 275 to 350 without VAT for each item and quantity good for two.
Drinks are costly. We generally go for the economic one i.e. Draught Beer Pitcher.

Overall, A lovely place. :)
NOTE: For guys, they have a dress code. You can't wear shorts (three quarters etc etc.)

Its pretty surprising how much fun you can have at this joint. The seating arrangement is particularly intuitive; coupled with a very nice selection of food, this is a good place for unplanned hangouts.

This review I want to start with a question to "Zomato". Why is it showing that for two people approx. cost is Rs.550???? Even if you go through their menus, one won't find anything that would probably save your pocket!!!! May be that's why. :pNow, I am not a very recent visitor of Gossip. But after renovation of their place I see that they comes up with some changes in their menu. Though change is good for business. :) As i always said before that, mostly i love to drink, especially beers. My journey started here 6 yrs back, when I just started my college and from when i started knowing that other than Kingfisher some other good brands are there in the market. Well, all reviews are not what you recently did, but history. This place is well known to me. Even one could have found me every alternate weekends , "Gossiping" with my friends, if its 2007/08.
Aaaaahhhhh!!!! Golden Days.¬†As Ajay Nagar is connector of Jadavpur and E.M. Bypass, this place have posh people. So naturally place is a bit costly, though what they are showing now in their menus, is in one's range of budget.Well I hope I shall soon visit this place, and will pay a review. I am a bit curious to know how they are doing after renovation.Ciao.....

wel they revamped their menu so u will get a completely new kind of choice which is extremely good and since its right in front of my complex when ever i come back to india i visit there. they also have home delivery for near by areas . it has 2 sections pub and restaurant. smoking is not ¬†allowed inside. we used to have a gaming parlour in front of it so after long matches of DOTA it was our cooling off spot. there r two dishes which are not on the new menu but they still make it u tel them or in our case they knoew we r only going to have those
pan fried chilli chicken¬†
and chicken cheese pikada (not in home delivery menu)

gossip is located near hiland park. locating it is easy, just take a right on the service road before you hit the ajaynagar crossing and drive for a minute and it's on your right. parking is easy in front of the restaurant.
it's in the first floor and they have two restaurants. the older one is having a lounge kind of feel and the newer one is more like a restaurant. i like their lounge like ambiance, perfect for chatting with friends over some nice food and drinks. we tried various kebabs e.g. chicken tikka lasooni, reshmi kabab, mutton sheek kabab, fish tikka and all were excellent, tasted great, tender and spicy. however, amount per service was on the lower side. bar is well stocked and the price was reasonable. staff here are friendly and they suggest food according to your choice. overall, a very nice place for hanging out with friends in the weekend evenings.

I actually do like this place and the food ! 
The best part about their food is , it's extremely fresh and they maintain hygiene. 
So I came here with my cousins and had a good experience. 
We had ordered 
Jeera rice , butter nun , chicken bharta , daal makhni. 
~ jeera rice was really good 
~ butter nun had enough butter ;) 
~ chicken bharta was good too. 
~ daal makhni was a bit too salty but okay. 
This was a bit expensive but well.

Yet another special day for me,at a special time of the year and of course with somebody who has been a part of me.
Before I put this restaurant into my good books,my friend had told me something about this place "Belonging to a city like Bangalore,I never knew Calcutta has places like Gossip"- of course this came a lot towards the end.
Amidst terrific rainfall and a very gloomy weather we had decided to hangout at this place.
The restro-bar is more of a small Sheresta that is located off EM Bypass in the Ajoynagar area.
When I entered this place I was awestruck by the vivid decoration,long couches and the artistic graffiti on the wall.Now this place can accommodate maximum 30-40 people at a go,quite comfortably and the getup is really that strikes you first when you enter.
The wall graffiti was even more striking...something like a modern art of a simple bicycle and a wall dedicated to famous quotes on 'Gossip'.
Being a restro-bar we opted for some Vodka after taking a good look at the various cocktails and Reserved Collections mentioned in the Menu Card and displayed in front of us.
For some fried food we settled for the Chicken Cheese Pickada(fried chicken in cheese and oregano) and Chicken Italian Kebab (kebab chicken in oregano and olive oil).
Having these two fantastic dishes we really couldn't have anything else.But there were more exotic dishes on Prawn and fishes like the Fish Pikada(using Bhetki fish) that are served here.
Really didn't bother to look at the sweet dishes much.

One interesting fact about the restaurant are the lights and the lamp shades.Keeping the interiors a little dim add a lot of flavor to your purpose of visit.I figured out this place to be really nice and a special place for a date.
On weekends parties are hosted here but otherwise the crowd is quite good and the place is not so over crowded.
All in all a very good experience,very pocket friendly and the restaurant staff deserve a special thanks from my side.
Hoping to visit again soon.

A very good place to hang out in, over the Bypass and very nicely located. The ambiance is very good and the place is also comfortable in terms of sitting and relaxing. The place is surely expensive and the food is good in quality but less in quantity. The alcohol is also expensive as well ¬†and they are very often out of beers like Tuborg or Carlsberg, max times we get only Kingfisher. No smoking allowed inside the place. The food takes a bit of time to get served. But, yet a very comfortable place to hang out at.

Planning a dinner at Gossip was probably the worst decision of my life. I decided to take my husband out for a dinner on his birthday. I called up Gossip at around 8.15pm to check if seats are available for two or not. I got the confirmation from them that seats will be available . When I reached there with my husband at around 8.45pm we were told that seats are not available. I asked for the manager and he had me waiting outside for 10 minutes only to come out and tell that seats can not be arranged. When I told him I had pre-booked 2 seats he said other customers came in so he could not keep the booking. I felt extremely embarrassing and on top of that instead of apologizing they sounded quite rude.With the kind of pathetic customer service I received before even entering the restaurant I don't think the feedback about food quality of that restaurant matters anymore. Too bad Zomato does not allow anyone to give negative ratings.

ORDERED - 2 Buds, Roasted Lamb, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Schezuan Lamb
PROS - Food was very nice| Rest rooms named innovative (Standing Ovation & Balcony Seats)| Location is great (5 mins from my residence)|
CONS - Restaurant was DARK| Service is awful (waiter serving us was seemed we've disturbed him from his noon siesta)| Beers were not 'chilled' enough & limited options| Beers are overpriced| Limited menu options| Desserts unavailable| Orders took LONGGGGGGGGGG enough to reach covers|
RECOMMENDATION - Yes! Only to have great food

I was in the ajoy nagar area with a friend who badly craved a drink! So we decided to hit gossip which is the only decent bar there! We took our seats at the top area and being a weekday there were hardly other guests! The alcohol was fairly priced... And since I was in no mood to drink... I called for a fresh lime soda and a rice cheese ball which simply pleased my taste buds! The service was ok! But while we were leaving this place is somehow don't like the crowd! So that's about gossip :)

I have visited this place several times with my friends for a drink as this joint is near to my place and it is the only decent option out there. Once you are inside the place is very calm & quite, they've got comfortable seats, plays good music and you can also watch live sports too. The staffs are courteous and attentive. 
My all time favourite is their crispy chilli baby corn, chinese salad, american fried chicken, chicken ala kiev and tandoori chicken. Their presentation is very neat,hygienic and service is fast. 
But I personally think some dishes are a bit overpriced and this place is not at all pocket friendly.

Have been there few weeks back and its a small cozy place.Its situated few steps ahead of Hiland park.The area isn't much bigger .Seating arrangements are okay and the ambiance is decent unlike other bars and pubs.Music isn't that loud,so you can have a good "gossip" with your pals.The Beer batter fried fish was good.We ordered crispy chicken,beer pitcher,and beer batter fried fish and it wasn't that heavy on pocket. 
                                    You can hop in there,if you wanna have good chit-chats and gossips with your friends.Its an "adda" place.A strict no for the people who want loud music and party harder.

Visit this place for reasonably charged drinks, good food and nice ambiance! We visited this place after browsing zomato for an hour, because Gossip was near, had good reviews and a very cute name.

Some of the Gossip staffs were chilling at the entrance of the Unnyan Commercial Complex where we were waiting waiting for A to join us. S did not like it and instantly told us to go to a different place. However, the moment we entered Gossip, there was a marked difference in behavior of the servers. They instantly became polite and guided us inside.

The decor is classy, comfortably lit. Our order in food had chicken salad, lung fung soup, pan fried noodles and chicken in hot garlic sauce.

The starters and drinks appeared pretty fast. The chicken lung fung had the perfect froth and taste. The ratio of pepper and salt was correct and I enjoyed it. The chicken salad had soft and tender chicken. The main course took quite a lot of time to come, although the place was not very crowded. The pan fried noodles was disappointing after the wonderful soup and chicken salad. However, the chicken in hot garlic sauce made up for it somehow.

The decor is pretty. I loved the lamp shades that were kept beside the couch. The bar area is done in black with scribbling here and there. A nice and cozy place to visit with friends.

A nice place to have a mug of beer and chat with a group of friends who wants to catch up after a very tiring day. Couldn't believe that such a happening place actually exists right in the middle of nowhere. Bestest of all happens to be the rate of tequila shots. I generally go there for those shots only.

Can widen their range in the food section though but overall it has a nice ambiance, good booze....

My cousins stay in the complex next door so have visited this place a couple of times. I won't say its swept me off my feet but its not bad either. Crispy Chili Prawn , Schezwan Lamb ( we asked them to make it a little dry as we had it as a starter) , Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Roasted Lamb and Crispy Chilli Baby Corn are the various items we sampled and were quite nice. The beer was served chilled and service time was reasonable. However like other foodies have commented the lights were seriously too dim . Not a place I would specially make plans to visit but if your in the area and want to grab a bite or a drink with friends its a decent option.

'A raved bar amongst the Santoshpur, Ajoynagar locals' was my first impression about Gossip, and this is exactly what had excited me about visiting this place. 
Ambience - Very chic, to say the least. Impressive, clean and well maintained. But everything falls flat because of the super dim light. Near the entry, the entire setting has close to nil light, and forgive my poor eyesight, but I couldn't figure out anything on the menu or even on the plate. I actually used the cell flashlight to do the needful. The music played basically depends on the crowd since it is mostly on requests. While me and my friends were present, people requested for Manna Dey, Jagjit Singh, Aashiqi 2 (several times). We had to intervene when the third number was in loop, and our request was kept. Thereafter, the management itself moved on to playing Dream Theater, Floyd, etc. Thus, overall a pretty nice place to spend an evening. 
Service - The waiters are extremely well mannered and pretty efficient. Though we had a row regarding the kind of songs on loop, was pretty impressed with the way they managed the situation.
Food - Every cuisine adhered to its taste. We ordered fish orly, chicken tikka kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, roast lamb and pan fried chilli fish. Chinese, Mughlai, Continental, all were perfect on the taste buds, well cooked, soft, juicy, and served in a decent portion (6/7 pieces each). The food was pretty YUM actually. No wonder 5 of us ordered that amount and licked it off too.
We went to Gossip at around 7.30 and left at 11.15. I had a nice evening because of my company, but what I take back is Gossip is a place where you can be yourself and have a destressing evening out, given you are okay with a few thumbs downs. 
P.S. - There is one sole green bikini placed as a wall hanging just by the washroom. WHY? I have no idea. :/

Good food and that's what was making me coming back to this place, until the following happened:

I was there with my family (my wife and kid) as I had an impression from my previous visits that this place could be enjoyed by a family even though it's a restaurant + bar. While I was waiting outside for a table, my kid was attacked by a girl whose age was around 25 and she was a part of larger group of around 8 - 10 people of same age. I could pick up from her facial condition that she was a drug addict and heavily drunk. 

The chaos quickly got escalated to Gossip management and to my big surprise no body came to my help. I was so scared from the group (who were smashing bottles and even fighting among themselves) that I had to leave that place.

Bottom line: Good food, bad management, dangerous crowd (goons?) who quickly acquire the place and turn it into their personal "Thek". Couples, families, be aware of this place. Better safe than sorry.

I've visited both for brunch and dinner, and find both to be really quite enjoyable.  A dear friend swears by their lemon ricotta pancakes for brunch (seriously! Lemon and ricotta and pancake - DELICIOUS), and on my most recent visit, , huh?) and their Kababs.  Both were sensible portions and rather tasty.

When going for dinner, I find the service really friendly and knowledgeable, the food memorable, the wine selection interesting, and the drinks tasty.

I believe one's opinion of gossip will be in accordance with his purpose of visit to the place.
As a place where you can sit and relax with your friends possibly over a glass of their excellent draught beer, the place is excellent. It is also a fine spot to go on a date provided both of you are into boozing.
The ambience is very good...the dim lights, the soft music does every bit to get you into mood. The waiters appear and talk smart, which is always welcomed.
I would somehow not recommend gossip for a boozeless outing though. Although their bengali cuisine is somewhat good and chinese dishes edible(last time i went there the dry chilli chicken had too much soya sauce in it and the chicken didnt taste fresh) that hardly makes it a good eating house.
As a bar gossip has a double thumbs up from me.
Not so as a eating house...

a nice place to hang out with friends. It has 2 sections -one for the family and other for the general one in which bar is also available . As this restro is adjacent to my house i went there frequently. I always prefer friendly seating and not the family one , as it's ambiance attracts me. 

 waiters are very friendly and well behaved. they suggest you with their specialties. 

Now comes the Food. This is the place which offer you wide varieties of cuisine with very affordable price.  Kashmiri lamb and rosted lamb are  undoubtedly their specialty dish . they offer you with quality starters.

Pocket pinch is Rs.500-600 for a full course meal . 

So i rate this place 4 out 5.

As I sit down to write a review for gossip memories rush back. It was one of our so called Posh Bars for me around 4-5 years back when I was just finishing school. Back then the beers used to cost around 120 out there. Do not know when their dine in section opened separate or whether it was always there and did not notice/care for it. Went here today after ages. The dine in section is really nice with very good interiors, couch comfy seats however the light was kept very low was blinded for the first few moments as soon as I entered this section with friends. The decor with posters and how well they had managed the place with tables with iron rings and nice lamp shades and so on gave the place a totally different look, one which is very innovative and clearly shows how well planned the place is.

On a Sunday afternoon found very little customers maybe 4 or 5 tables occupied in this section including ours. Taking that into consideration I believe the owner either does not care much about profits or is a very bad planner when it comes to staff management. Too many waiters which was surely not needed. I also saw too many cameras fit in where I felt they could have come up with a board stating that people here are under constant camera surveillance. This, I feel is necessary since it a bar cum restaurant and though we friends did not order any alcoholic drinks but a couple might just want to get cozy after a few drinks. I agree, a restaurant is definitely not the place to get cozy but then keeping a warning board is always beneficial.

Now the sad part...Yes I know you have named the place Gossip and luckily we too had gone there to spend some time and gossip but if we have to wait more than an hour (and trust me we did keep an eye on the watch since some of us were very hungry) for our food to be delivered then I do not think it helps much does it?? A clear point where the owner must look into is that he should have more chef than waiters, maybe substituting a few with another chef.  Maybe we could have been served some food early in case the food was taking so much time (especially since we had asked how much more time will be needed) to be made but then no we waited on and on and when we were served we found certain dishes very cold. The basic thing you should make your staff understand is that the food should be hot even if it has gone cold just so that customers do not understand it you should heat it up in a microwave and then serve though I think in that case the same dish should not be used to heat which is being used to serve since the customer will understand. I know being a customer am giving ideas which are against my advantage but then this is the basic(s) you should know to create an impression. The food was overall nice. We ordered Chinese and it was the normal Indianised Chinese we get everywhere and the Fried Rice had very little salt in it. However the best food was the Pan Fried Chilli Fish.

The prices were high but that can be accepted on the basis of the nice decor but I wish there was a little more light it was too dark for my lighting. Maybe, considering the decor and the fact that the area does not have many well decorated restaurants serving good food to give an over all dining experience, they should bring in a few better cooks and make the food a bit more authentic. It can end up being a mega hit because I know people living in that area who come all the way to Gariahat or South City to get a good decor+food experience.
Overall a mixed experience but I sincerely believe with few changes they can be a mega hit in that area because they have the advantage of very low or rather no competitors in that area when it comes to the overall dine out experience. I hope they can end up changing things for the better. The good part is that they did not drive us away as soon as we had finished our food.

It's a really nice place to hangout with friends and family. I liked the ambiance very much and so do the service it was really fast and behavior of the waiters is friendly. Nice place to booz with chilled beer and food! Tried several dishes and they were really great, "Chicken Satay - with peanut sauce" , The chicken were melting in your mouth must try, "Beer batter fried fish - with white master sauce" Simply awesome with white sauce it was teasing like heaven, "Crispy baby corn" really good one. Must visit place for a foodie.
