Served some weird fibrous fish in Chilli Fish that was sorta off smelling. Chilli pork was last night's boiled pork tossed in gravy. Noodles were bland. The only decent thing was the soup. All this on Ashtami afternoon.

A deserted restaurant. Food was good but the soup waa horrible. This restaurant is ok in the locality for a quick bite but not for family or friends outing unless it's an emergency.

Visited this restaurant in sector 1. It is nicely decorated being dimly lit. Ordered chicken prawn hakka noodles with chicken manchurian and. Chicken fried rice. The quantity and quality is enough for 3 people. Taste wise it was good. The chicken consisted of 8 pieces which was soft and succulent. Hence had a fulfilling and satisfactory meal. Would come back for more.

Situated at Kwality More in Salt Lake this place is over 30 years old and is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in the city. I have many fond memories of this place and happened to drop in at this place a few days back after around 18-20 years!! Food as always was great and pricing was reasonable. The interiors though need some renovation to compete with the modern restaurants. The staff was also very polite and courteous. Overall a place where one can enjoy decent chinese food at reasonable prices.

Being a resident of saltlake Dan Din's is quite a known place for me. The Interior and decoration was ordinary. Service was quick. 
Last time when I visited this place I gave order of biriyani. Some of friends opted for fried rice and chilli chicken also.
They served the food. Suddenly I realized that something was moving inside the biriyani. We told them to change the food. They did. Unfortunately again there were ants and insects inside the biriyani.  After that incident we left the restaurant without having our food. 
This is totally my experience. You may not face the same situation.

One of the oldest restaurant of salt lake. I used to go there on my childhood days. But after my last visit I can say that was my worst experience. I have ordered 4 mixed fried rice for takeaway. They packed my food with aluminum foil. After I reached home when I opened the foil I saw it was not mixed fried rice it was fried rice with mixture of biryani.
Worst experience I will never ever visit this place again.

This place is a hidden gem in salt lake. A small restaurant serves delicious Chinese preparation. Ambiance is nice. Visited there for a lunch with couple of friends. We ordered chicken chow and chili chicken. Service was fast and foods were simply amazing. Nicely cooked with fresh ingredients. Chili Chicken was awesome. Not too much spicy. Â A must try place for chinese lovers. Pocket pinch is reasonable.

The place is difficult to find but once you're in you will experience the one of the most amazing noodles in kolkata. When i went to this place for d first time i underestimated the place coz the entrance is a bit shady and i dint expect much. But the food quality is lovely . Please don't judge dis place without trying the food. Its worth it.
