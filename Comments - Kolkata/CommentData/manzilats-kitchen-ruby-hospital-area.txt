One of the best biryani and kebabs in town. The variety of kebabs, the ulta paranthas....everything is mouthwatering. Not to forget the awesome haleem. Love the food. Hope you open a restaurant soon. Definitely recommended.

Manzilat, the love with which you create your dishes reflects in the presentation, the Bouquet and of course the taste. Its an addiction, once you have it, you have to have it again. Hail the Biryani Queen. All the best!)

The Biryani is absolutely delicious, I would rate it it as even better than many of the famous biryani shops in Calcutta. The Kashmiri shir chai was new for me (because of its pink colour) and I loved that too! Hope you will open a restaurant soon enough in Calcutta <3

Awadhi cuisine, and that too by a direct decedent of none other than Nawab Wajid Ali Shah.. expectations are bound to be high. and Manzilat does not disappoint.. every dish served by her is bang on in terms of flavour and texture. It is very evident that she uses only the best ingredients.. as far as taste goes, all I can say is that you take one bite, and you will be hooked for life.. Absolutely outstanding.

I am a very regular person who orders from Manzilat's. I have never had any problem with the experience -- from placing order, to delivery, to communication; and first and foremost the taste and quality. The food is very light and easy on stomach without compromising on taste. Very much recommended.

Manzilat doles out dishes that are to 'live for'... well if we die for something, then that would be the end of that enjoyment, right ? ðŸ˜Š

While I have tasted most of her kababs my personal favourite is her ghutwaan mutton kabab... a 'melt-in-the-mouth' delicacy ! She picks popularity with each person who tries her cooking. To top it off, Manzilat adds her personal warmth to every order too ! Thank you for introducing us to you ! ðŸ˜Š

Well what can I say, Biryani prepared by the royal lady. She really has magic in her hands. The best part is the food quality, tender meats and the personal touch. If you want biryani and kebabs for your soul this is the place.

Let's talk about history...and this place certainly has a legacy to tell. Manzilat Fatima the proprietor/owner of this place is a direct descendant of Sultan Wajid Ali Shah. Need I say more?? So you can certainly expect Awadhi cuisine in its undiluted self from her kitchen. And yes the food speaks volumes for itself.....the Pasinda kebab and the Ghutwan kebabs were celestial. We had ordered the mutton variants and along with a couple of Ulta Parathas they felt ambrosial. The Biriyanis were excellent too....both Chicken and Mutton Biryani...not too oily and perfect to the taste buds. And the Mutton and Chicken Chap were good too.... different from what we are served at many restaurants here in Kolkata... different but piquant again. Now having talked about the positives....let us come to the drawbacks. Well, this place is a hidden gem in the truest sense. But every treasure hunt needs a few clues/hints to be discovered.This place definitely is in desperate need of a few directional leads cause getting to this place is difficult (to say the least). If you are going by vehicle to pick up your order it can get cumbersome.  Additionally, a bit of advertising would certainly help this place a lot more. Otherwise a lot of Awadhi cuisine lovers in this city might just be deprived of digging into some good food and that would be unfair to us foodies. Let us know with elan that Manzilat's has arrived. In return the voices shall reverberate that Manzilat's is here to stay just as I affirm.

Dear Readers, The food from this kitchen is celestial. I can vouch for the quality which is authentic and genuine. Being a Mughlai food lover, I tasted a wide range of dishes in India but never came across this type of delicacy. Manzilat is the Best. She uses genuine spices to enrich her quality. Not only that, her subtle cooking style will make you weak. The quality of her kitchen should reach all quarters of Bengal. The people of Bengal must know what is actual taste of Awadhi cuisine. All her preparations are unparalleled, awesome and OUT OF THIS WORLD. The aroma from the kitchen will tickle your tongue. One should not miss. I pray for the kitchen's successful journey in the coming years. Will keep on updating my feedback. Thank you. Kaushik

Not just a new kid on the block; if morning shows the day, they are here to stay. Manzilat Fatima, running the show, belongs to the family of Wajid Ali Shah, the Nawab of Lucknow, responsible for introducing biriyani in Kolkata. With a short and crisp menu on offer, kebabs are undoubtedly the scene-stealer - and the Pasinda is the undisputed "Pele". We tried the beef and the mutton pasinda - simply out of this world - am now confident that I would definitely pass the tests on the Judgement Day!!!! Have tasted quality beef in many joints - this probably is one of the best, if not the best; combine that with an unparalleled taste, a perfect blend of spices, and you are simply walking on the clouds.....the beef gilawati, & the beef handi are the other two "greats" on offer; and the parathas served here are again something one cannot afford to miss......they serve a good mutton chap too......so what are you dolls and guys waiting for.......BTW, this is a place that serves all the three variants of meat - beef, mutton and chicken which is definitely another USP....
