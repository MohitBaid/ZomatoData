visited this "SO CALLED 5 STAR HOTEL" on 31st Eve, it was such a bad experience like never before. No place to sit, all tables were pre-booked as if we visited there free of cost, damn!!! we paid 8000 bucks that too 2 days before just to stand the whole night????.wen we asked for a chair or tool ¬†they said they don't have extra chairs and this is a dance club not a lounge..people come here to dance not to sit...what a cheekiest reply from the management. They just wanted to extract as much money as they can in the name of the hotel by neglecting our comfort, satisfaction which is the indispensable part ¬†and essence of a hospitality industry.¬†

low quality starters with very limited range and service was so poor...waiters were just roaming with the plates in hand....n worst part was the main course food items..i mean a 3 star hotel would have served much better food with wide variety... n the food containers was almost empty and no one came to refill it ,we were just standing and waiting for the food to come....very poor management....and at last not the least worst DJ ever.

i will never ever visit this place again and would not recommend anyone. it was all wastage of time & money!!

Worse new party ever!

1. For a glass of water people had to beg for atleast 15 mins. I mean begging literally every time you wanted a drink.

2. There were no choices in food stall and once salad was finished, no one came to refill that. Felt like as I was at 3 star hotel with limited range of food. Even where the food was, there was no appropriate light was there. People were using their mobile torches.

3. People were smoking while dancing. After complaining, boxers ignored the request.

4. As mentioned drinks were unlimited, but right after midnight, they were finished.

5. Worst DJ ever. Even though club was supposed to celebrate party up till 3 am but they kind of stopped everything after 1:30 am.

6. Found one guy inappropriately touching his genital outside of restrooms.

7. The most unprofessional behavior I have ever encountered at JW Marriott. I so wish to get my money back and give them minus rating in return. They spoiled our entire night.

Worst experience!  
It's like a 3rd grade new year party with third class service, over sold for money, no choice and range of food 
Lowest man power for service 
You need to beg for snacks at kitchen doorstep 
Even it was a challenge to find a glass of water 

All tables were pre  reserved and not even a chair to sit for some time 

Sheer wastage of money -Rs 8001/- couple entry charges for new year eve 

Never ever recommend any one to go to JW Marriott Kolkata

Called to enquire, they said cover charges (is a night club) are 2k per person (not couple). If you can justify the charges for this nightclub I would definitely pay a visit and review my rating. 

FYI these charges are at par with the most expensive clubs in Europe.

This place came across as one of the best nightclubs in terms of ambience & decor. The spacious dance floor was an add on. They have a good range of liquor but most of the domestic drinks mentioned on the menu were not available. Food quality was okay for which I rated a bit less. Prices were reasonably fair considering its JW Marriott. But I didn't enjoy the music much. It was loud but groovy. Hospitality was comendable. A must visit for the party goers. Overall good experience.

Went there last weekend for a private party and the place is fabulous. The decor and ambience screams of class from every corner. The bartenders are well trained and curate lovely beverages.
I just had a couple of whisky sours which were spot on in terms of balance, taste and presentation.

Will visit again for sure to explore more :)

JW Marriott is the most happening place in town currently . We celebrated my mom's 50th birthday at GOLD ! In the beginning I was a bit skeptical because the hotel is new and Gold has just recently started functioning . But I was very pleasantly surprised. The place has a very beautiful ambience , the name "Gold" totally compliments it . There were 4 DJ's and 1 Vj playing which is a new thing in town . I loved the music , totally groovy! Coming to the hospitality part . The bartenders were amazing , they made killer drinks and shots . The staff was extremely helpful and enthusiastic, they enjoyed serving us , were on their toes and very prompt . They made shots from their side , plus the live bartenders on the floors were also super fun ! The food was delicious ! All in all I loved my first party with Marriott and am sure to hold many more such ones ! Cheers Guys ! üòé

It looks to be am becoming a regular visitor since i came to this place first on the month of April with my office colleagues. Excellent ambiance with a wide variety of beverage choice. The chicken wings were really mouth watering. The bartender had a very impressive way of presentation and service; if am not mistaken his name was Abhik. The place does not attract much crowd now as it has been newly open but I would pull over there with my friends at least twice a month. the music needs some improvement otherwise i had a excellent experience of a Friday night.

Something different to go to...loved the compartmentalised concept...decor with a twist as you cross those helmet torched hanging on Wall...ample place to enjoi the way you want, dance drink or just chill with friends. Menu pricing is quite sensible...food pick up time needs to be little less...service people are really friendly and warm. All in all Its worth your visit and I am quite sure it will turn   repetitive.

The rating is not because of the ambiance or the music as I have visited it before and found it good, but it is basically for the attitude and behaviour of the staff at the clubs reception and the hotel manager .  Last night I called the hotel and enquired  about the entrance criteria and I was  informed that 'profile entry' will be done at the gate. Knowing that I do belong to that required standard and class , I visited the club with my husband . On arrival , the staff at the clubs reception saw us from top to bottom and then said it's only for invitees and members. To this I went and reported the same to the hotels reception and asked to see the hotel manager. Another couple had the same issue and were standing with us in the reception. The manager came , spoke to the other couple and didn't even bother to address us and went straight up to the club without having a word with us. We were waiting for almost 30 minutes. Then the receptionist came and told us that the place is jam packed that's the reason we were not granted entry and that the only people entering are of the 'elite' class. 
Now my issue is that I know that I do belong to the ' elite' class that's the reason I chose to go to this particular club. 
Secondly, my husband is a hotelier and a member of the HOTELS & RESTAURANTS ASSOCIATION OF EASTERN INDIA and we know how the hospitality industry works. The attitude of the staff is way below standards .
Thirdly , the reception said something and the club had another version to narrate . No one is coordinated and are saying different stories. 
I am a traveller myself and stay only in the  best of 5 star properties around the world, this is not the standard and quality of staff behaviour accepted in the niche service industry .

I went there last month with my friends to check out this place and trust me no other night club in the city can be as happening as this. The ambiance, decor, lights and music is top notch. They have VIP areas with personal Butler arrangement, normal couches called gold coins for everyone and there is a ln awesome dance floor. But it is advisable to call up the place before going, as you might find it desserted on non party days because it's new and people ain't much aware of this place. For entry and everything you should contact the expert, most humble manager Mr. Kobid Sinha who is excellent in his work. 
The alcohol charges here are also minimal, not at all high plus the service standard is just what five star deluxe has to offer! 
I had budweiser with my friends here and with taxes it cost me rs 350 per pint. 
So just explore this finest edition of night club in city as soon as you can!

These 2 persons are main attraction of this place, their service is so quick and energetic. Specifically Sameer is outstanding at tables, he suggested nice drinks and food. This is our third visit and we will definitely come again for the outstanding staffs. Cheers to Gold and staffs...!!!!!!!

To be honest Gold is one of the best night club in the city of joy. had an amzing experience last week. I didn't booze much as per my habit which i had already disclosed to the bartender, Avik and he served an excellent old fashion. The snacks were finger licking. Will come back soon to this place with my friends. The manager, Mr. Partho was an excellent guy; just loved his way of keeping such a groomed nature and beard.

Newly opened nightclub lunched about a month back located at the basement of JW Mariott. At present the club is opened on Wed, Fri and Sat and on the top of it, its a ladies night out on Wed only allowing entry for both couples and stags. For the moment there is no entry fee, but on occasions the entry fee can go upto 2.5K for couples. The lounge is open for the guests from 8 pm onwards.
On entering the club hits the bar straight with the lounge and the disc floor and live DJ is on the left .Coming to ambience, of course its lavish golden theme with birds cage view that is definitely an eye catcher for every guest with cozy english style circular golden sofas. 
Visited this club sat evening, though the lounge was not accessible due to some private party, hence had to grab the stool at the bar. Enjoyed the whisky based cocktail - Heart Beat which was amazing. The wooden stools @the bar was not that comfortable would have expected some cozy bar stools. However i am really delighted with the hospitality of the bar tenders.

The lounge of JW Marriot - Gold is no doubt very good. The ambience is wonderful and the service of the staff is to be appreciated. 
However we were a little disappointed with the DJ yesterday.
We were a huge group of 32 to 35 people and even on requesting the DJ to play our choice of song he refused to do so which was very rude.
We repeatedly requested him to change the track and refused to do so even when though we were so many in number.
This kind of a behaviour is not expected from the staff and i request the management to look into it.
