Certain things are best cherished in nostalgia. This restaurant located in the first floor of the building opposite to Indrapuri Studio is a haven for camera lovers and the locals who are looking to have an instant and affordable solution for their dining needs. I was a regular at this place during my college days and visiting this place all over again brought a plethora of nostalgia. The restaurant, not having altered its decor over the years, every table exudes a bag full of memories of good and great moments.
The decor is basic with mild lights and cameras, decorated, of the 40s, 50s, and 60s inviting the guests. Service is always quick even during busy hours and the waiters are ever smiling even in the face of criticism. The chairs are of wrought iron not helping one to the greatest degree of comfort but its a great restaurant to have an animated conversation with a group of friends.üòäüòÜ

However, I was gravely disappointed upon trying to revisit my old memories. While everything remains just the same with the place giving you a feeling of a studio, their service and cleanliness has gone for a toss.
For the sake of good old times, we ordered dry chilli chicken to savour with whiskey and beer and chicken and mutton biriyani as mains. The chilly chicken remains the same with its soft, succulent and tender. Its decorated with fried onions and capsicums which are equally good to taste with alcohol.üòãüòã
The biriyani was bland and the quantity appears to be drastically reduced. üòïThe mutton however was very soft and tender, giving you a feeling of melt inside your mouth.

But then we encountered a cockroach!!ü¶éüôÑüôÑüòëüòê That too on our table. Yes you read it right. Whatever the price point may be, it is a cardinal sin for the management of a restaurant to not know how to keep it clean. The waiters upon being informed looked on blankly with a face of "what can we do about it".
Why the hell are you guys even working the restaurant then??üò°üò°

More than the food and the service, this incident completely ruined our experience and evening.
Probably never going back ever again.üòï

We visited this nearby restro bar few days ago. Location wise easy to find 5mins walk from tollygunge metro or more towards 6 no route. I have had Budweiser magnum after a long time . Staff was cordial but food prep time was on a higher side and it was okayiesh. Good thing was that the restro wall is decorated with vintge Bengali movie posters. Overall
Food- 3.5

Overpriced resto with less quantity, quality is good but nothing exceptional........ A person here remarked that going to this place gives an old kolkata charm but honestly speaking I feel to get that charm more I would visit mitra cafe or Allen's kitchen and sit in wooden chair and have piping hot fish fry or chicken cutlet than this empty show off place.

It was during pujo that we went to this particular restaurant and nearly had to wait for more than 2 hours to get our seat on the astami evening. It was so tiring and we were so hungry that finally when we got our seat I was not in a mood to click any pictures. We ordered some Chinese items that includes both chicken and fish items along with some beer. We were told that the fish item would be medium spicy but since medium wasn't even suiting our taste buds, on insisting they changed that that dish devoid of any spice. The service was good even during the rush times and the quality of food was also appreciated. Only I wish I wouldn't have to wait for such a long time. üòÇüòÇ

With all the Retro movie banners..and an awesome collection of Cameras..the place gives u great Ambience all in all.
Moving to the service well..thats a place of concern...coz everytime you want something u have to shout out to a waiter... 
The food is quiet ok...nd the price tag on Drinks is reasonable.... 
Great family place too... the crowd is mostly youth in Corporate ppl...
My ratings would be

Not at all a good place! Gloomy, suffocating and extremely congested! We visited this place during Durga Puja.

We ordered a bottle of beer with Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. Then we ordered a plate of Mixed Hakka Noodles. The service is poor. We had to keep asking for some water!!! But the prices of the dishes are on the higher side. Nobody would like to spend such an amount for the poor quality of food they offer!

Hope they will improve their food quality and service.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Silver Screen located near the Tollygune metro station has truly  being amazing in every respect. Starting from the decorations to the food to courteous staffs. Since it was festive occasion in Kolkata, therefore we had to wait a little bit but at least it's worth the wait. It is generally a spacious resturant and has separate rooms as well just in case you want to have some separate time away from the hush hush. Since we went in with a large number , so we got the big rooms as for accommodation. We ordered one vodka, 6 Budweiser , Tandoori chicken , Two fried rice and one Manchurian Chicken. 
The food tasted so yummy. Definitely had a good experience after a tiresome day roaming around the city during Puja.

This place gives you a feel as that of a studio. Full of cameras, the 90's actors , directors pictures, this place has a very nice ambience. Being very close to my house, I have been to this place a multiple times. It's a multicuisine restaurant. Their Chinese cuisine is pretty good, but the Indian cuisine, not so good. I find the Indian cuisine very overpriced. On the other hand, the Chinese cuisine is pretty good. Sweet corn soup, crispy chilli babycorn , America chop suey are my favourites. This place also serves alcohol. If you want to drink, and enjoy Chinese food, you can try this place.

Located just adjacent to Tollygunge Petrol Pump.

We ordered both chinese dishes mughal dishes.
Chinese : crispy butter salt n pepper which was good. Chicken was tender and juicy. As staple we ordered chicken gravy noodles which was disappointing. The gravy was full of starch powder and the noodles were so thick that you could taste the flour in them. This was the first time we had chinese here.

Mughal: Butter naan with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. This was the best chicken dish I had tried out. The gravy was too good and so was the chicken.

Ambience: 2/5 although it says a 'family' restaurant. The ambience is definitely not right to visit with kids.

I was there with my family last night. After selecting and rejecting a list of restaurants for the dinner, finally we decided the venue as Silver screen, as this one is the nearest from our home and it was raining lightly outside. We ordered varieties of dishes. The food quality was good and also the quantity we ordered were enough for 6 of us. The service was not too fast, but it was okey. I found one interesting item in the list of menus , it was honey noodles with ice cream . I wanted to try this one , but they said it was not available, this needs to be ordered before hand so they can prepare the dish. Overall it was a good experience.

Been here a long long time back, when we unfortunately didnt had any ZOMATO app to review about.

This place is a very elegant place with a bar cum restaturant.

(Note : Will review about the Bar separately)

Silver Screen is strategically located just near the very popular Tollygune Moore, in Charnock City. So it wont be a hussle to find it. Metro drop : Tollygunge metro station Mahanayak Uttam Kumar.

The place is very neatly decorated, with well dressed waiters, and very well behaved. The crowd here is very sophisticated. It is a themed restaurant, so the theme will change from time to time and depending upon occassions, as it was told to us. When we visited it was about Tollywood classics.

The food served here really meets your expectations and is a little pricy. When I visited way back in 2011, i dont know why..but they had this rule that you got to order a starter or else the main course can't be served. Neither can you take any beverage (not alcohol) without taking a side dish. Thats really frustating.

Food recommendations, I wont give any..and mislead you guys..cause i really forgot what i ordered back then, but what i do remember was that the Cold Coffee was very smooth and creamy, and also the waiters were very cooperative and neatly dressed according to the theme, with purple Waistcoats and Bowties, wih white gloves and sporting a very decent bright smile. Really loved it.

This place is good for some after office hangout, relaxation, or may be fine dine.

I have to give this place a visit soon, before i can give my ratings.

Verdict : Good food, well maintained and nice ambience sums up for a formal dinner or a Corporate hangout or even family occassions.

We are all Nomads...so keep food hunting..!! :D
Chow chow!!

This place has been open for a long time now. It's situated right opposite the Indrapuri Studio in Tollygunge. The inner decor has a theme of the evolution of Indian cinema over the years. Ths restaurant, served no alcohol then. Quite few of the Tollywood artists could be spotted soon after the joint was opened.
Now coming to the food, they have quite a range of indian and Chinese dishes. I was in love with their biriyani and other north indian delicacies. Jeera aloo, chana dal, dal makhni and tandoori roti reshmi kabab chicken bharta every dish has a different taste and is well made. They excel at chinese too.
However after the transformation of this place into a Bar and restaurant , it doesn't attract a lot of people. You might now find it a little disturbing to dine in as some people after a little booze loose their mind and no person is appointed to take care of these issues. I hope they make a separate bar section and make the dining experience better like before.

This place has been open for a long time now. It's situated right opposite the Indrapuri Studio in Tollygunge. The inner decor has a theme of the evolution of Indian cinema over the years. Ths restaurant, served no alcohol then. Quite few of the Tollywood artists could be spotted soon after the joint was opened.
Now coming to the food, they have quite a range of indian and Chinese dishes. I was in love with their biriyani and other north indian delicacies. Jeera aloo, chana dal, dal makhni and tandoori roti reshmi kabab chicken bharta every dish has a different taste and is well made. They excel at chinese too.
However after the transformation of this place into a Bar and restaurant , it doesn't attract a lot of people. You might now find it a little disturbing to dine in as some people after a little booze loose their mind and no person is appointed to take care of these issues. I hope they make a separate bar section and make the dining experience better like before.

Been to this place a couple of times, and never I had been disappointed..be it in terms of food quality or the service. The decor of this place goes well with the name. Located at one of the prime spots in town, its reasonable as well. Although I have never tried out the special in-house dishes, I personally have loved the biriyani and murgh lassoni kebabs. However I have not liked the garlic shredded chilly chicken. Gonna visit soon for trying out some other dishes as well.

Had a very good experience from this place.  My sister and brother-in-law organised an event over here. The service was nice as well as the staff was courteous. The food was also good.  We had fish fries and l must say it was so so so yummy that we all asked for it for more than once. Along with it was served mayonnaise and kasundi along with salad. Then we had pea pulao with paneer and mutton kasha. At the end we were served chutney, papad and the sweet event ended with double scoop of chocolate ice cream. Loved the food from this place.  Looking forward to another visit to this place.

On the first floor of Charnock City 2 in Tollygunge this place is not that great a spot you would choose to go. The restaurant has posters of old hindi and bengali movies and the lighting is a little on the darker side. The ambience feels more like a shaddy bar than a family restaurant. Coming to the food (ps. I am commenting only on the vegetarian food), it is edible and not more than that. Simple and regular stuff, nothing out of the box to wow you.
All in all a place which I wouldnt recommend and if you happen to have visited then a place not worth remembering, hence the very late review from my end as well.

Anywho another chance is a must! The servers nonetheless were well behaved and decent.Try for yourself and know it better! Enjoy‚ò∫

Just 5 mins walk from tollygunje metro station, this is just one place where u get booze and food under one roof in tollygunje area. The silver screen ad the name suggests is a theme restaurant which takes u to a filmy world moment u enter the place.Tne rate of cocktails and alcohol ate bit too high compared to the place.  The place serves both north indian and Chinese food.  Though I hve mainly tried their kebabs and North Indian stuffs only.  The kashminiri pulao and chicken in white cashew gravy was very tasty. The kebabs needs to be more tender and service, quantity and quality needs to be improved a lot.

Went there with a group of friends. They were quick enough to arrange for a secluded dining area for us. The food was pretty good. But the alcohol prices seemed a tad steep. There is room for improvement (literally) for the decor as well. Overall, if you are around Tollygunge and want a booze+food option, this is the one for you.

Frankly speaking i don't like this place at all because of the ambience and also the extreme slow service of the staffs. Have been here quite a few times for a quick bite or some light drinks. Last time i came here we ordered a beer along with dry chilli chicken and chicken hakka noodles the quantity was very less if you compare it to the pricing. I have decided not to go back there again even though its near my locality. I am always finding too many cons here. Taste of the food is also okay type.

Visited last night. Ordered murgh biryani, murgh bharta, bacardi white rum and foster. The biryani was a bit overcooked but I liked the murgh bharta. A full mixture of spices and a little bit of sweetness. The quantity of the food is not at all acceptable. you'll have to order another to satisfy your hunger.

Coming to the service, the staffs seemed very much unprofessional (Served the food without spoon). 

The ambiance  was also disappointing. 

¬†Anyway overall okay type experience.

Soft, instrumental music playing all around along with movie scripts on the walls. Coming to the food, it was nice although cannot call it outstanding.

Located just opposite Indrapuri studio. One has to walk 7-8 steps towards Garia, Ranikuthi from Tollygunge. Ambiance is okayish. They indeed have beautiful music and the theme of film-making is unique.
We had chicken sweet corn soup, crispy chilli babycorn, plain tandoori roti and navratna korma.
The soup was tasty and perfect, so was the babycorn.
Roti was extremely ¬†thick and stiff.
We had to ask for the salt-pepper set on reaching there as it was not available initially at the table.
Curry was extremely sweet. Though it was cooked in cashew paste, still the taste was not up to the mark.
Quantity is okayish.
Service needs to improve a lot.

Located just opp Indrapuri studio at the joint of tollygunje, this is a joint to look out for in between tolly to garia sector. Located on the 1st floor this is a descent corner well equipped with beautiful decor and ambiance..Music with light tune ¬†and dim lights on the background soothes your mind ¬†instantly..Staffs and hospitality were friendly indeed..The most enthralling part was their food which was delicious...Price goes well with quant and quality so thats a thumbs up...They sumhow lack varieties in their liquor section which is a bit concerning fact bt rest assured everything else is nearly perfect..

It was saturday and I hopped there with my colleagues. During my college days I used to come here. Located on, crossing tollygung metro if u take a left turn, the road towards bansdroni. The interiors are good (theme based on studio) and some antique camera hanging on ceiling. Ordered for dry chili chicken, french fries and red chili peeper fish. Somehow the dry chili chicken was less cooked and it was made without capsicum. Fries & fish were good. But the prices will give you a pinch in your pocket. The hospitality was also not up to the mark and they don't serve strong beers. So from next time I have to think twice before going there.

A budget hangout place with a big sitting capacity. Drinks & food are quite cheap but more often than not you don't get most of the items on the menu. Taste of food is also quite good. We ordered for Salt n Pepper chicken which was really tender & juicy. The Mixed Hakka noodles was also good. Another thing which I liked is a good price to quantity ratio. The staff needs to be a little more professional. Surely this place can be visited multiple times.

First thing on entering you notice the theme is different. I kinda liked it. Gives you the feel of the 80's. The menu is also designed that way. Jumping on to the food quality and quantity. Just too good.. Chilli Lamb Roast, Veg seekh kabab, Chilly paneer and Mutton Biryani all were bang on absolutely delicious. The biryani had a punch of flavours in it. Coming to the drinks menu, not a variety of cocktails you will find and the cocktails are not that good.. On the menu there are number of beers. But less than half are available. When I was there for the waiter said only Fosters, Kingfisher Blue and Ac Miller was available. Was a big let down. But the food didnt dissappoint us. Thats the reason of my rating. Just add a few more varieties of beer and silver screen will be my staple pub.

Quite a decor they have got in there.. A bar plus restaurant opposite to Indrapuri Studios in Tollygunge area.. And maybe the only bar-restaurant in this locale.. Quality of food-good, quantity-good, price-too expensive to go everyday.. Should have rated 3.5 but gave an extra 0.5 just for the waiters who were superb in all ways..

Knowing Mr P K Mukherjee (owner) personally surely will make a difference to my review,not by default..but for the kind of personality he is,reflects into the food... with the going on prawn festival , you will find mouth watering delicacies of prawn ...but also the other dishes worth mention is the mutton handi, and chicken starters. They have a unique taste of there own. The mutton mentioned is pure grounded masala preparation with a Bengali touch. Maintaining the good old tollywood charm and a touch of Hollywood and Bollywood..the ambience is worth mention... and yes ! don't forget to look at his collection of cameras displayed.... it's equally good.

I love the place .....The ambience. It shares its ownership with Charnock and the Silver Screen in sector 3 saltlake. 

The place is awesome. Located near the now closed Indrapuri studios it has the essence of a Tollywood set. 

It has this great collection of cameras both still and video cameras that was used in the Studio. Also being in the heart of Tollywood the theme chosen for this place is really good. 

I had come here for lunch with my colleagues and had ordered the Golden Fried Prawns and the Diced Spicy Chicken for Starters and the Mutton Handi and Tandoori Roti for main course

The best part was that tge Mutton Handi was made boneless on request and at no extra charge. This kind of customer customization is what sets this place apart .

The chicken was good and tasty.
As for the Golden Fried Prawns, the taste of the batter for the fry was a letdown. Otherwise the fish was super fresh and super tasty. The prawns were jumbo sized and were definitely a treat.
The‡¶ø mutton was an absolute delight. Whike being incredibly tasty and succulent and soft at the same time.

Had a lovely time . Looking forward to my next time here

Well this place is our alternate dining room. One of the hidden gems in Kolkata I'd say. Service is amazing. Food likewise. A very pocket friendly Bar Come Restaurant. Sometimes this makes it a little too crowded and chaotic. Thus costing a rating of .5. Items to look for, Chilli Chicken dry, pan fried chilli fish, crispy fried fish. Peace.

Stumbled upon this place while coming back from work. Situated bang opposite Indrapuri Studio, this place is film industry themed, as the name suggests. The decor is minimal, with movie posters from the yesteryears. Nothing overwhelming about the decor though, but it is neat.

We were super hungry. We had ordered pan fried chili garlic chicken noodles and chilli lamb in oyster sauce. The waiter informed us that chili garlic noodles come with gravy, which is a bit shocking. We settled for chicken hakka noodles. He further notified that oyster sauce is not available, therefore we settled for chili lamb in mint sauce. The waiting time was high. When the food arrived, the waiter informed that they did serve the lamb in oyster sauce.

Coming to the food, absolutely no complaint about that. The quality of the spaghetti used was perfect; very nicely cooked in chicken cubes and veggies, with a perfect balance of the spices. The lamb slices were cooked to perfection, absolutely succulent and soft. The gravy too was spot on.

I would have given a 3 to 3.5 because of the waiting time and the not so great service, but the food stole the show.

As this place is near my house, I frequently visit here. 
Decorations are classic, every one will love the ambience. I have tried almost every dish here from Chinese to Indian. Food tastes just perfect. People who loves spicy food must visit this place. Must try for them is gosht (mutton) rogan josh. Its taste is beyond perfect. Chinese dishes are also well-cooked and tasty. Among starters chicken lollipop is best. And their masala cold drink gives perfect taste than any other restaurants. Among desert I always go for vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce or tutti frutti. Price is a bit high but the quantity and quality both are as per the price. Overall a very good place to have a fine dine time.

Just after crossing tollygunge metro if u take a turn on left, the road towards bansdroni-naktala after 100 to 150 meters you find this restaurant cum bar on your right. This gives a feel of tollywood movie sets with a lot of pics of uttam kumar and other Bengali actors-directors. There are displayed lights, camera to add on to the decor. 
The service here is prompt, went there quite a few times for grabbing couple of drinks with friends. Starters like tandoori chicken, dry chili chicken, baby corn is palatable. Price is average, but food quality needs to be improved a bit. It gets crowded on weekends or else its quite empty on weekdays.

The atmosphere of the restaurant reminds you of a place where you would go for a few drinks but the food is quite decent. The prices though are on the higher end. The service is quite good. The food is what you ordered and expected. The mocktails are priced upwards of 300 so you might want to think twice before you buy those.

Going by the name of this restro and the portraits of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen at the front..it gives one the retro feeling of the Indian film industry..the interiors represent a film set as well with posters from various films during the 70s and 80s enchant you as you dine away..the waiters were happy to serve and very friendly creating a nice ambiance..coming to the food we ordered egg biriyani and chicken tandoori..the biriyani was very well cooked..less oily did that trick for me as well and the tandoori was simply lip smacking but a tad on the costlier side..then came the desserts..the two scoop vanilla with hot choco sauce with its thick chocolate spread and the chocolate shake with ice cream..overall a dedicated restro for a retro feel and good food.

Located just beside the Tollygunge Petrol Pump and it's the one and only bar-cum-restaurant in the locality I guess. Paid a visit to this time a couple of times. Staffs are warm and friendly. Ambiance is okayish, little blunt. Posters of the different Tollywood movies are put up on the walls. Portions are ample specially the prawn gravy dishes though they are shrimps actually. And their Special Sundae is lip-smacking!

What we ordered - Chicken Lollipop, Chicken Salt n Pepper, Chicken Fried Rice, Prawn Hunan Style, Special Sundae

This place being very close to my college, we ended up here one fine evening after college. A really well decorated place with loads of cameras, photos and films showcasing the whole of Tollywood. And at the heart of Tollygunge, it's really an eye warming experience. The locality is filled with studios on all the sides and this place gives you the perfect feeling. 
The food is on an higher side of average with mostly all alcoholic drinks available.

For the decorations and ambience, I would surely suggest a single visit to this place.

Being located in a locality surrounded by film studios, this place captures the exact charm of a film studio with its interior decor designed like the same. Apart from being a restaurant, the place also acts as a tribute to the Indian cinema, off course with its name and the design of the walls with posters and signage of films.
The food is genuinely good, and the staffs are polite, courteous and friendly. Especially Mr. Pavel Chatterjee, the manager of the restaurant, is extremely prompt, well mannered,and enthusiastic to provide his best so as to leave every customer with a smiling face and utter delight.
But often(specially on weekends), the restaurant gets too overcrowded and noisy, which eventually slows down the service and also disrupts the charm of the place. And in this context I think the restaurant authority should take necessary measures to request the visitors speak in a bit low toned voice. Trust me, should have given a higher rating if the ambience was not that noisy. Moreover, some of the items in menu card are often unavailable, on which the management should work upon and try to get it fixed.
And yes, pocket pinch is a bit high if you order alcoholic drinks, but food items are reasonably priced.
Overall, a nice place to check in for lunch or dinner.

This is quite an old bar cum restaurant in the tollygunge area which was once very popular amongst the tollywood stars as it's located just opposite to the indrapuri studio..
Have been coming to this place for around 5 years now and really enjoyed every time!
We can clearly call it a Tollywood-themed restaurant as it show-cases variety of cameras, shooting reels, posters of legendary tollywood stars, advertisements of newly launched bengali movies, etc.. The ambience is quite sober altogether with the always-on-the-toe waiters. They are very helpful and well-behaved.
Coming to the gastronomy now, i do enjoy the food here, be it the kebabs or the curries or the Chinese. Tried and tasted almost all of them. Love their chicken tandoori, murgh lasooni tikka, reshmi kebab which goes so well with the
booze! Oh by the way, it has a very well stocked bar, serving alcohol on an affordable price!
It has been a saviour to the tollygunge area dwellers for more than a decade.
It stands rock solid in a place where u do not find a sober bar cum restaurant which u can visit with your family. (which is actually very very sad. We need more such good places here!)
Must pay your visit if you are wandering in and around tollygunge!

Interior decoration is like a film studio with lots of filmy posters and you can also see some antique camera over here and you will get a filmy ambiance over here. Yes this is a bar cum restaurant and you cant smoke inside. Anyway we had some hard drinks and beers with some delicious starters like Drums Of Heaven, Murg Hariyali Kebab and Mixed Boiled Vegetables. I must say that you will get lots of VEG option over here and they are really very tasty. Service is well and good, it takes some time but still its OK. Coming to the price range its average. As this was my first time in Silver Screen I would like to rate them as GOOD. I would like to come here again.

I have been here zillion times. This is indeed a good place. If you are aspiring to pay less but get more, this is where you must come. The ambience has the aura of contemporary Bengali filmdom with the large-sized posters from different Bengali films. The food I can say is really good. From rice to noodles to nans, from chicken to fish and non-vegetable dishes, they have vibrantly a diverse range. They have a separate bar housed in the same commodious place. The organization is neat, good and the service is also good. In fact unlike some other restaurants, this one takes way less time to get you your ordered take away. This place is a decent one. Most importantly the toilets are clean and well-maintained. I think that's the crucial brownie point scorer invariably everywhere.

This place came up with a great idea of celebrating Indian Cinema and thus, the name 'Silver Screen'. The food that they serve is good, especially the kebabs and the main course. Though, this place has turned to be a regular one for the regular drinkers, but still they have maintained a certain norm which allow people to come with their family. The beers and other drinks are bit on the higher price and a good satisfying lunch and dinner with drinks can cost around 1500 bucks.

PS : People who are passionate about cameras, can actually have a glimpse of some old cameras which were used for various films in the past decade.

If someone wishes for variation then this is a great Theme based Pub-Restro. The theme is as the name suggests. And to bear testimony to the theme, there are real cameras ,wires hanging and standing as it happens during real shooting of a film. 
The food is good both in quality and quantity. Also the ambience is nice and gives a feeling of time travel backwards through Nostalgia created by the decor!!
Scallen Fish, Tandoori, Kababs are a must try at this place. Besides there is a lot of variety one can find in the food!! One is free to choose as they wish!!
The only downside is the Service of the Staff which needs improvement !!

Intro : This is a theme bar . Theme is evident in the name - tollywood cinema . The entire decor is done accordingly. Even they have got real cameras displayed right through the ages !

I had dropped in for a quick beer , hence cannot comment on food . Was in a hurry, couldn't click too ... Will update on my next visit
Service : Needs major improvement , the staff s attitude is such that they hate what they are doing and as if they are paying for my beer !

Overall : 3/5

The food is good but my suggestion is to have a separate bar and dining or else the ambience becomes very noisy and people with families are unable to talk in their own table.  This leads to a bad impression. By removing the bar to a different room both people and in bar and diner place can enjoy to the fullest.

Located just near a 5 mins walk from Tollygunge,Silver Screen is probably the best restaurant in the neighbourhood.Yes.It does have its shortcomings.The entrance to the restaurant is not that great.It remains crowded on weekends and the alcohol is not really that cheap.If you go in a large group,ask them to open the adjoining room,cause I found the main area a little too crowded.Coming to the food,its really great.The quantity is sufficient.Mutton Kassha and Paneer Tikkas were heavenly.The Biriyani was also good.The food is really not that expensive.So if you are in the neighbourhood with your friends,Silver Screen won't disappoint you.

P.S-The restaurant is decorated with old film posters and cool antique cameras.0.5 extra for this.:P

Being the only big ticket restaurant in the neighbourhood allows this place to be a bit pricey. Food does not disappoint though. Service is slow on most days, especially in the evenings. Plus, the alcohol makes for a loud crowd. Good for takeaways though.

Silver Screen is located near Tollygunge metro,visited this place several times.¬†The restaurant follows Cinematic theme,but i didn't like their film posters inside the restaurant. In food section i love their Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Roast Chilli Mutton as starters.In main course Biryani and Slice Chicken is good.
Overall good experience...

Located just opposite to Indrapuri studio tollygaunge , it dedicate it's decoration to Bengali cinema.At the back side of this restaurant you will see vintage cameras used in cinema , the walls are covered with film posters n if you look at the ceiling you will see flashbulbs n lots more.Visited here several times in last few years , in fact it's one of my party zone to hang up with my friends,seniors n juniors.Lovely ambiance , delicious foods n the price of the alcohol is very decent.Don't forget to order "Crispy Chilli Baby Corn"(My fav here) and "Pan Fried Fish". Those who are non alcoholic surely try some mock tails at last. Lovely, just lovely to visit n revisit. In my Uploaded photos i mainly try to catch the ambiance or the lovely time we spent here together. Hope all of you will love them.

Decent priced alcohol combined with good food can be a real deal if you ain't much fussy about ambience. This place was a delight of a discovery of one of my gal pals and we had an amazing time laughing and drinking here on an odd Saturday evening. Try the pan fried fish in schezwan sauce. It's a winner!

Looks could be deceiving. And Silver Screen is a perfect example of that. The food .. Starting from tizer, to drinks to all Indian n Chinese entr√©es  are simply fabulous. The chilli corn is probably the best I ever had. You really can't beat their prices  for the portion size and the quality of food. The mutton do pyaaza n butter naan. Give it a shot. All the soups were cooked to perfection....I was pleasantly surprised by everything that had to offer from food to service.... can't wait to visit this place again...

Mostly took Take Away or home Delivered food from here. Must mention their pan fried fish is delicious and their chinese food stuff is commendable. Their interiors and ambiance are not classy or for family people(owing to all kinds of people dropping in for drinks).Definitely, good for home delivery, must order - Pan fried fish, garlic chicken, chicken mixed hakka chow, special fried rice.

Nice place.. I go there almost after evry 1 or 2 months.. ambience is very nice.. food is very tasty.. my favourite dishes which I have very frequently are mutton biriyani, chicken makhanwala, butter naan, & amongst all pan fried chilli bekti is a must try.. one can have that with alcohol or with sweet lime soda.. either of these complements well.. regarding the quantity they serve enough to satisfy hunger.. thumps up to the quality of food, neatness & cleanliness maintained there.. 
They should add few more items in the dessert list.. 
One of my favourite restaurants... 
A "paisa wasool 1"...

THE SILVER SCREEN yes very appropriate name with the surroundings and the interiors. Its just opposite the tollyguange studio and the interiors of this place is unique with all posters of films and they even have a collection of all old cameras used in the film industry.
They serve both food and liquor and the food quality is really good. I love their Steam fish a lot and their mutton preparations.
Its on a bit expensive side but you cannot complain with the quality and the quantity of the food they serve. 800+ tax for two is approx.
You in the tollyguange area and looking for a decent food option along with a couple of drinks then this is the best option as this area has a very few options available.
Too lucky u can even get to see a few tolly stars hanging out there. :)

This is one place where Zomato doesn't have a menu given and the general impression of everyone is that this place is on an expensive side...well not absolutely true....its a family restaurant with above average ambiance and a nice collection and not many in that locality, so the prices are fair in comparison...a light kingfisher 650 ml is 165 incl taxes. I think that is reasonable. i heard the food was great reading some of the earlier reviews but it wasn't out of the world but not bad as well. We ordered some crispy fried fish which was good and really crispy fried in KFC style but coated with cornflakes...chicken 65 where the gravy was good but not as spicy as a chicken 65 should be...also the chicken was bland from inside which means it was not marinated well...we ordered another dish which was boneless tandoori chicken tossed like a dry chilly chicken....a couple of cold coffees with ice cream and 2 beers...the overall bill was 1400 which was ok....the service was prompt probably because it was a little empty of a Sunday peak hour....but the server was friendly with a smile and that's why i gave an added .5...i still feel that its a great location with bigger opportunities to do better than what they are doing today...a little dissapointed with the decor though....

As I live in N.S.C Bose Rd, this is an eatery I frequently visit to catch up with some booze n finger food. We really do not hav any decent bar in this area. I always luved their decor, a 'tolly tele theme' with lots of posters, cams, lights...a set like atmosphere. Food is yum ! I tried the roasted fried chicken n liked it, the prawn items r good as well. Stewards r gud n well behaved. However, I am never convinced with the quality of liquor they serve. It is advisable not to go for any costly booze @ Silver Screen.

This restaurant is just walk away from the tollygunj metro station. It is located at a nice place. The people are nice. I will suggest people to try the bar, its just great and serves well. The starter Baby-corn is awesome. I will suggest that it is a must go for food lovers, though you won't Find anything unique here, but it suits well for a dine.

In an alcoholocally deprived region like Tollygunge, Sliver Screen serves the purpose of an oasis... I am a regular visitor here for the last many years. Being opposite to the Indrapuri Studio, its theme is "movie." The decor is quite interesting with film posters and paintings. One can get to see different types of movie cameras also which are definitely  a collector's delight. But, with time, more and more tables and chairs are being crammed into the resto-bar, which has left very little open space inside. The staffs are polite and courteous and always try deliver their best. However, when the crowd increases, the service becomes drastically slow, probably, the management hasn't decided to invest much in recruiting manpower. Still, I like this place very much - I have a lot of fond memories here.... The food is quite good, specially, my favorites, Chicken Tandoor, Dry Chilli Chicken and Fish Finger. They prepare different types of kebabs also, most of which are pretty decent. The main course isn't bad either. Alcohol price is slightly on the higher side, but considering the fact that there isn't any other bar at Tollygunge area, the price can be accepted. 

I won't mind recommending this place..... :-)

The  ice  cream  was  alright... The  service   was  good  though  take  excess  time  to  bring  the  bill!  Overall   a  nice  experience.

I have been to Silver Screen several times in the past.. Today I revisited the place for a quick snack in the evening after a gap of almost a year. So thought of reviewing it here. :) 
Location and ambiance: Located bang opposite Indrapuri Studio on NSC Bose Road, inside Charnock City 2 on the 1st floor, it is a Tollywood themed restaurant with Bengali movie posters on the wall. Interiors are done up mostly in Blue. There are around 20-25 glass top tables with chairs (no sofas) which can accommodate around 60 diners.
Food: Silver screen is a multi cuisine restaurant cum bar which serves both Indian and Chinese. I have tried out chinese most of the times. My favourite non veg starter used to be the Fried Chilli Chicken. In fact I always made it a point to try this item when I visit Silver Screen. But today I was disappointed. It is not the same any more. The chicken pieces were soft and tasted okay but it was very oily and the crispy feeling to it was absent. Still I would recommend this starter. It comes with 8 decent pieces of boneless chicken along with fried onion and capsicum, costs Rs 165 +tax.
The chicken sweet corn soup tasted very nice. Thick soup with generous amount of corn and shredded chicken. Priced at Rs 110, it is definitely recommended. 
We did not try anything else today but previously I had tried their chinese main course like noodles and fried rice. Both tastes pretty okay, but I would recommend Noodles over Fried Rice. I had tried chicken Tangri Kebab once and it was strictly okay to taste. Crispy chilli babycorn is also nice and the serving size is decent ! 
Unfortunately the bar is not well stocked. Beer of your choice is never available ! For example today only Budweiser was available. They stock premium alcohol upto brands like Johnny walker black label. Pricing is moderate. Tuborg costs around Rs 164. 60ml Signature costs Rs180. Since there is no decent family restaurant cum bar nearby, the restaurant does not face any stiff competition, hence they increase the prices frequently. 

Service: Service is usually fast. Waiters are courteous. But the billing takes ages to be processed! On previous occasions, I have even spent more than 20 minutes just to get the bill ! 

Final Verdict: If you are near Tollygunj(Tram Depot) area and want a drink with your lunch or dinner, then you may try this place out. Ambiance and service is just okay and nothing to brag about. Still the restaurant is usually full on weekends since there are very few decent options in that area. Cost for two should be around Rs 750+ tax. Since they have increased the prices recently and today's chicken was not that great, I think 3  would be the justified rating as of now.

Silver Screen! I remember entering the restaurant because we were driving past, hungry & we could not locate any other place in the near vicinity. That's one advantage they have apart from the fancy name & yes, I liked the interiors which actually gives you the 'Silver Screen' feel. Apart from it, I don't think there is anything I would like to mention about this place. I mean there is absolutely nothing worth mentioning. We had fried rice, which was mediocre. The chilly chicken was mediocre. Over all I would give it a 2 & never bother going back again.

ambience is  decent  but  nothing  worth  mentioning  .  the  biggest advantage  that  silver  screen  has  that  it is  on nsc  bose  road  bang  on  tollygunge  ,  which  means  that  people  have  very  few  other  choices  for  bars  in  this  area,  thereby allowing  them  to  charge  a  bit  extra  due  to  lack  of  competition  .  food is average too , nothing extra  ordinary . well coming down to business  , we had 4 old monks @ rs 100 / 60 ml peg ,  for  food  we  had 1 plate  murgh  biryani  @  rs  130  /  plate  &  1  plate mutton rogan josh @  rs 210  & the  bill  came  at  rs  993  ,  which  i  found  a  bit  costly considering  the  taste  of   the  food  , which  was  mediocre  .  overall  a  2  from  my  side  ,  mainly  for  those  people  who  live  on nsc  bose  road  on  tollygunge  .  not  worth  travelling  for.
