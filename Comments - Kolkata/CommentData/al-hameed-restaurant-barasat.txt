Not at all satisfied..... Need to improve a lot.....is it a food what they serve? We ordered simple butter nun & plain nun ....which was cold & stiff..... They just casually told it is because of AC !!! We took some special chicken item beside it....which was pathetic again.....only the Savior was tandoori Chicken which made me realize that they can't make good foods at all. Also they are forcing for cash payments instead of having card payments, saying their card has been taken by the bank to upgrade with GST features.... Hello, it is a POS terminal only....what do u think ourselves? Fool? I will never visit this place again.

This was my 2nd visit. The restaurant is located at Barasat duckbnglow more. Quite specious and decent decoration. Lighting is quite good specially for selfie lovers ðŸ˜œ
Price is affordable according to food and service.
Staffs are good.
Our orders were Mutton Biriyani, tandoori roti and chicken kasha.
Taste was quite good specially biriyani was very satisfactory.
Quantity is fine.
Ambiance is also on point.
Overall, a very good restaurant in this area.

Today I visited this place with a devil's hunger so I forgot to take pics. This is located at dakbanglo more very easy to find out. I came here for the first time due to my friends advice. I ordered for chicken Rashmi kabab and chicken biriyani. Both tasted good but the biriyani was served cold so I told them and they quickly pay attention to that. Environment decor everything was good. But what drew our attention that the lady seating in the next table complained about problems regarding order placed which they have not served moreover 6 person sitting on another table also left with argument with the staffs. Really good food but if staffs are not enough responsible and well trained about the menu then its hard to grab customers. And also I have seen deficiency of staffs to attend all customers in rush hours. If the authority appoints some trained staffs I think this problem may be solved.

Went yesterday there. Decoration is simple yet good. Staffs are not attentive at all though there was only 10 people including us. They were busy in their gossiping. Menu variation is very less specially in veg. They were not much aware of ingredients of dishes so when ask they answered that they don't cook so can't tell it . If u r ok to get ur food at least after 30 mnts of ordering then only go. We ordered veg fried rice, peshwari polao, chiken Tikka masala, paneer butter masala, butter naan n salad. Taste was ok but quantity was less. Salad which was made hardly consisted of half of the cucumber n slices were so thin tht one could see the opposite side. Ac was malfunctioning so our clothes got wet.
