This was one of the places where i usually visited whenever I wanted to have Chinese at lunch. Their service is good and so is their food. The quantity is much to meet your hunger pangs. It's location is also pretty good and there were many seats available. The ambiance is okay.

I went their with my family on April Fools day but I was not fooled with the food. It's a budget restaurant, price is very pocket friendly & the food is quite tasty, as well as I wud mention about huge portion they offer. Two plates is more than sufficient for 3 ppl. We ordered Singapore noddles, mixed gravy noddles, chilly garlic chicken, mainly singapore noddles & CG chicken is just awesome. The service person is very co-operative & decent & helps to select the items. But it's a  Mediocre restaurant, a bit shabby, not so much decorated. In terms of food quality, quantity, price wise, I wud recommend it to the food lovers. The location is prominent but very dusty due to metro work, which is just opposite to Zeeshan, Park Circus.

This chinese restaurant is located in the heart of park circus. Went there with couple of friends for dinner. Interiors are a little shady due to the dimly litghted environment. Ordered for a chicken lollipop which was a good. Dry chilli chicken with mixed fried rice were the mains. It was pretty medicore to be honest. The service personnel needs to be a little more alert in order to anticipate guest needs. Would suggest the management to work towards the quality of food and service sequence.

This restaurant gets lost somewhere in the park circus area which is mainly ruled by restaurants serving mughlai cuisine.Even I was unaware about this place until my friend took me here.Its a budget eating place serving Chinese cuisine present in the lane just opposite to Zeeshan.Food they serve is pretty good.
We opted for a special gravy noodles and kung pao chicken(dry).

‚Ä¢Special gravy noodles-Its different from their usual mixed gravy noodles by usage of exotic veggies like babycorn, mushroom, bell peppers, broccoli and fried egg on top with runny yolk as it's cut opened.Portion was really huge.Its a very comforting dish to have on a winter evening.Amount of meat and prawns in it was adequate and they tasted fresh.

‚Ä¢Kung pao chicken(dry)- This was an excellent dish.Took it suggestion of the server and we weren't disappointed.Crispy chicken tossed in a sauce which tastes sweet on the tongue first just to be awakened by this hit of spice later.Loved the addition of roasted cashews that's expected in Kung pao chicken.

Service was very efficient.The person serving us was always keeping a watch and was spontaneous to fill our glasses and clear the dishes without being asked for it.Good place to drop by when on a tight budget and craving for some old school Kolkata style Chinese food.

You can call it our most popular Chinese cuisine getaway ... definitely at times of financial crunch ... coz the place is completely "Paisa Vasool" if u understand what I mean.

Our regular there are Thai Soup, Fried Prawns, Chicken Lollypop, Gravy Chow/Mixed Fried Rice, Shanghai Chicken/Kung Pao Chicken.

All of them r delicious and being a regular, we do enjoy a bit of advantage over others as in, at times, we get their chef to customize a particular dish as per our mood on that particular day. The attendant is also very warm and welcoming with relevant suggestions if we r in the mood to try something new.

Definitely recommended.

Had gone for dinner on Sunday and it was disappointing.  The quality and service has gone down at an alarming rate.  The restaurant is understaffed to handle a full house.  If your looking for regular Chinese food, the place serves  decent quality.But if your looking to try out something new or different, it will disappoint you. The quality of fish is pathetic. And again the service provided was disappointing.

Located near the Park Circus Tram Depot and C23 Bus Terminus. The ambience is good. Food is worth each penny. Quality and quantity of food is good but not exquisite. Coming to the staff performance...they don't interact properly with the customers. Even if the restaurant is not so full, they'll not serve you. Thus i will rate the service 4/10. Nevertheless...if you search for a good chinese restaurant at reasonable rate, you may visit this place.

This place is ideal if you are looking for good food to fill your tummy without going hard on your pocket.

Frankly the ambience does not enthuse you much. A bit cramped with average interiors, you start doubting whether you chose the right place. However, the food served from starter to soup to the main course are very good and certainly will give 5 star hotels a stiff competition. The service was fast if not of great quality. Prices are very competitive and I must complement the Chef and his team for the quality of food. The preparations are generally light and not oily. Overall very good food and great value for money. Will be back for sure....

I read mixed reviews on this place but the explorer in me was pushing me so I finally gave up and tried it tonight. I thank my premonition for doing so. Bunking the exteriors I headed inside. Being a Sunday it looked crowded. The decor is very basic and clearly gives the idea it is extended to increase capacity. Due to the warm weather skipped soup.Started with Fried Prawn and a Chicken Drums of Heaven. Ordered a Blue Lagoon mocktail and aerated beverages. The prawn arrived first followed by the drinks. The fried prawn truly surprised me, I was expecting a prawn pakora version as it was priced at Rs.180. What arrived was decent sized fried prawns in nicely seasoned batter.Tastewise full marks.It was fresh and flavoursome. The Blue Lagoon was well prepared and very refreshing. The Chicken Drums of Heaven was again tasty with a similar batter like the prawns. Very much enjoyed by the kids. Service was prompt and the server was cordial. Mains we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Chopsuey, Chilli Chicken. The Chopsuey was very filling not ultra sweet and the gravy was highly palatable. A special mention on the Chilli Chicken. ..It was fantastic. Totally customized for Kolkatans...The gravy was not corn floury ...It was light with the zing of green chillies . A dish u can vouch for...The rice was very fine quality tossed with big prawn, chicken , egg and veggies. Portion size is huge.We had to pack some home. The place is definitely underrated in my opinion. I have tried so many Chinese joints in the vicinity the usp here 1) Taste 2) Quality & Quantity 3) Pricing. Everything ranges between Rs.150 and 190 including prawns. When I received the bill I was shocked that no added tax....a huge dinner like this for 915. I'm definitely going back for more very soon. I still feel elated to try this place out.Foodies do give it a try if u still love old Kolkata Chinese. Highly pocket friendly and totally justifies  the cost.Happily eating with

We had the mixed fried rice which was authentic and really really amazing, paired it up with Thai Praws. Soft, succulent prawns, out of this freaking world. And then the chicken lollipops. Super amazing quantity. One plate of fried rice was more than sufficient for 2 people. Its a must visit place. Can give any good restaurant a run for their money

Lucky to find an empty spot on New years eve, that too for 15 ppl. For years this place has been a good hangout for cheap and good quality Chinese food in the comforts of proper air conditioned seating.

Dim lighting and minimal decoration setup a decent ambiance. Not to forget a large screen tv on which a very annoying old Hindi movie was playing and the remote was nowhere to be found(or should I say hidden). Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken lollipop, Chilli baby corn, chicken Manchurian, schezwan fish, veg hakka noodles and fried rice. All of the items were served quick in decent quantity. The taste too was pleasant and certainly of good quality. The lollipop and Manchurian stood out of these.

The staff is not attentive though or maybe they lack experience. Basics such as water and spoons needed to be asked repeatedly to be brought even after the food had arrived. They seemed to be more interested in the movie I think.

All-in-all nothing extraordinary but certainly satisfactory. You can treat your family and friends some tasty chinese without much pressure on your wallet.

Probably the only chinese restaurant in that area. Went yesterday with two of my friends to have an evening gossip session and some chinese. It may be unattractive from outside but the inside is nice and comfortable with tv screen to watch games. We ordered a plate of american chopseuy and fresh lime sodas. Chopseuy tasted good but the amount of chicken was less. Lime sodas were refreshing. I was amazed to find sandwich and burger combos on their menu. Will come back to try the pocket friendly combos.

I must say this is quite a good restaurant. A good place for students like myself to hang out, have lunch or go on a date. The ambience is fine, the rates are also fine but the food is quite good. One good thing about Golden Bowl that I must mention that it serves Halal chicken so, being a Muslim, I was impressed by this. The service is also quite good. To round it up, I would say that Golden Bowl is a good , not exceptional though, place to have an occasional lunch or dinner.

One word- OIL! This restaurant is located close to my place and probably has more oil than the Middle East! The decor is average and the taste is average too. Prices are competitive and honestly, I would have ordered in a lot more if they could manage to not coat a layer of oil on their food. Sigh! the story of a lot of Chinese food served in Kolkata :(

The only place in Park Circus area which provides good and quality Chinese food at a reasonable rate in good quantity. The ambiance of the restaurant is ok; service is also ok. A decent Chinese restaurant in the vicinity. Still, the restaurant has scope for improvement. One could try their Chicken Fried Rice, Szechwan Chicken and Chilly Chicken.

Small joint with no special ambience worth mentioning. Most people come here to get take aways or order deliveries. Food is basic fare Chinese. Good clean flavours. Large generous portions. Is what the place is known for. They occasionally tend to make the food a bit oily. But if mentioned in advance they cut back on the oil so beware of that. But definitely worth a place you can try. Mixed meifoon. Thai soup. Prawn in scezuan sauce r my favourites

I have eaten here quite a few times. Quantity of food, specially noodles, is good and prices are reasonable. But the gravy noodles should have a little more gravy.

I have ordered food from here many times. This place is located opposite krazy kabab. Its a decent restaurant. The quantity is very good. The price is slightly high. Shanghai chicken is good here. Chilli chicken could be a bit spicier and i like the thin noodles, even the fried rice is good.

Fried prawns were merely pakodas and rice was severely undercooked.

Golden Bowl is one of my very regularly visited restaurant. My friend and I, we always go there for their Crispy Chicken. That is a must order from us always. Other than that we love the Mixed Hakka Noodles and also the Szechwan Noodles. All the time that I have been here it is not mostly crowded. Personally I don't prefer crowded and noisy restaurants no matter how popular they are, so this place's calm attracts me. The pricing of food is appropriate. But the interior is nothing impressive, a little mundane I feel. Otherwise it's a pretty good place to go for lunch any day.

It is a small chinese hangout zone near the seven point crossing..ambience is ok ok..food is nothing out of the world, just the basic chinese dishes one expects at any such restaurant. Chicken, fish are the only options in non veg but the quantity and the quality of the food is very good and it comes at a pocket friendly price. The only advantage of the place is the super quick service with whatever u order. The bill comes in handwritten form!! Don't worry these places are worthy if u don't want to burn a hole in ur pocket at the end of the month.

I have been eating in this restaurant for some years now and the fact is that I haven't till date been fed up with their food on the menu and the taste of food and quantity is remarkable the same since my first visit I had made some years back , so that's a good thing about this place but there are a few drawbacks also as this place isnt lit up properly making it very dull in the entrance and also inside there is a bathroom which is not kept clean and it just disgusts me to go even to wash my hands , so otherwise food is great here just these things if once taken a bit seriously then this restaurant is going to get a good name in Kolkata .

My verdict - food is great

chicken manchow soup
veg manchow soup
egg chow mein 
 veg fried rice
 veg manchurian 
chilli chicken

All the items were nice on taste. I just felt they could have reduced the oil slightly and increased the quantity. Prices are quite reasonable and overall experience was satisfactory.

Food is good, however to eat in the reataurant is to bear a lot of din, as the patrons are noisy. Please note that i visited the restaurant on a holiday, so maybe that affected the amount of people there. Would recommend the gravy noodles, and would not recommend eating there, take away is a better option.

Out of the few Chinese joints which Park Circus has to offer I would say this one is the best considering its value for money. I was a regular here during my school and college days however I stopped going there I don't why so when I visited this place last month after a long long time and still found the place to be more or less the same in terms of the decor and all I was happy in fact so happy that I went there 2 more times after that. Now contrary to the popular belief this place is not that small, there are even smaller restaurants around, the interiors are okay and so is the lighting. Now lets come to the food and I have to mention that they are really good be it the quality or the taste or the portions which they serve its really good as simple as that. The items which I tried during my last 3 visits were the thai fish, hunan chicken and schechwan prawn in that order. The thai fish was a first for me and it didn't disappoint it was the waiter who recommended it to us and I was pleasantly surprised the fish was soft as it was supposed to be and was spicy enough for me, the schechwan prawn in its thick red gravy was also good but I didn't find it that spicy to be honest however the prawn pieces were big and juicy and went down well with the spicy fried rice now I don't know why they named it so because it wasn't spicy at all I just ordered it because I just wanted to order something new and "spicy fried rice" caught my fancy nevertheless it was okay and when it comes to the cost rest assured it wont burn a hole in your pocket because never once in those last 3 visits has my bill ever crossed Rs.500. So based on my recent visits I would give The Golden Bowl a thumbs up.

The place cannot be known for their ambience or interiors, one scary fact is that I have never seen it full , but in times of desperate measures and the lack of proper chinese in this area, this can be a quick fix. They serve the food really fast and the quantity is pretty decent for the pricing. The service is bad though and attracting the attention of the waiter seems to be a herculean effort.The chicken seemed fresh and juicy and there were no problems post consumption.

The food is ok in terms of taste and only try it if you run out of options or have a strong chinese craving.

Food 5/5 
The food is the focal point here, and the portion size are quite large, one can easily share a main dish and a side dish (fried rice/ noodles) between two. What also adds to the delight is the fact that the food is not over loaded with onion and cabbage......., if you order chicken you get chicken you get chicken

Service 4/5
The people are courteous and friendly, during rush time (20:00 hrs to 22:00 hrs) you would feel a little unattended due to the fact that they also do home delivery.

Overall 4.5/5
Well when it calls for an overall experience I would keep on going there as its pure "Paisa Vasool"

Located at 19B, Naseerudin Road, Kolkata at Park Circus area, Golden Bowl is an authentic Chinese restaurant in the heart of the famous 'Biriyani para' of Kolkata. It is located near my place, and I often visit this gastronomic enclave, which has always satisfied my taste buds with its delicious Chinese flavors. Besides a family dinner once in a month here, I often place a take away order whenever there is any occasion at our place. Moreover, Golden Bowl has become a must-dine-in place for my building friends and me at least one day during the Durga Pujas, and this has been happening since our teenage years, as they serve scrumptious dishes at reasonable prices. 
This restaurant is not a very spacious or big Chinese restaurant like many other restaurants located all across the city, but its calm and silent ambiance with the warm hospitality of the staff is so appealing that anyone will enjoy dining here in a peaceful environment after a hectic day. All the tables are neatly set up in that small area so that no one will feel clumsy and congested. 
Whenever I am here with my parents and brother, we generally start with Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and Vegetable Noodle Soup (because my mother doesn't have chicken or mutton). So, she either opts for vegetarian preparations or fish preparations. Drums of Heaven, Prawn Ball Fried, Chicken 69 and Chicken Salad are some of the starters from which we make our choices every time. For the main course, I always prefer Szechwan preparations whether it is noodles or rice, because truly speaking I have been to many Chinese restaurants, some of which are very popular but the Szechwan preparations served here are just yum! The chicken preparations are lip smacking here and I have tried almost all their chicken preparations, and each one is totally different, especially their Sliced Chicken with Pineapple. As I don't have fish, I can't give a personal review about this category, but whenever I have been here either with my family or friends, I have always heard them saying that the fish preparations here are too good, and they often request me to taste a bit. 
Last year during the Durga pujas, when I was there with my friends like every year, one from our group suggested trying something different and she placed an order for Chicken Hot & Sour Soup. This is the only item here which I won't suggest to anyone - ever! After tasting this soup, I felt like it was nothing but the gravy of the Chili Chicken! Apart from this preparation, this restaurant has always pleased me and every visit has made me want to return here again and again.
