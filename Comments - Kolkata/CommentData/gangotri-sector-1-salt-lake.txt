The food is nice and lives upto good standards. The sabji of chana paneer is very good and I had chana so good in long time that I just avoided the mistakes in the food. Nice food but can be made better. And proper marketing of the place is also needed for people to know about it.

If you wanna eat healthy food this place is the right place for you. They use so little oil or ghee in everything. Even their fried rice was not even fried.like it.

This vegetarian restaurant is located right opposite the BF clock Domino's outlet and Santa's Fantasea. It is always teeming with a regular crowd of vegetarian  office goers and college peeps. The food here is nothing to write home about . In fact , it is tad expensive given the taste and quality. The chola bhatura here tastes average , with a weird black looking chola that made me wonder what they put in it! Anyway , the place is super popular for dosas and veg meals , so if you want a plateful of healthy food , you might consider this place .

This is an old joint, no frills vegetarian place in Salt Lake.

I recommend this place for their dosa, plain, masala and open genie dosa. 
The pav bhaji is brilliant and the pav is not very greasy.
The service is fast. The food is tasty and fresh. They also provide good home delivery services. 

The food is value for money and perfect for breakfast and evening snacks. 
Do I recommend it? YES!
What should you order? DOSA

Worst. I didn't liked the food. The food had no taste and specially the chola bhatura was the worst. I don't understand how can they run such a restaurant with this kind of food. I heard it is one of the oldest in Salt Lake but I was totally dissappointed. The dosa was also not worth it. Although prices are on a higher side the taste is on the lowest side.

We also had a Schezwan Dosa. Yummy, Not recommended for Kids though. It was kinda Spicy.¬†

A decent and economical veg joint few meters from my place, near Swimming Pool area almost opposite Domino's and Mobile Store.They don't have an elaborate menu but again have much to satiate from your breakfast to meal needs. The thaali options and combos are really good in terms of taste, quality and quantity...just if it would have been a bit spicier. I have tried their dosas for breakfast and as I have ordered it for home delivery I can vouch for the packaging, which is really nice, though they charge you a minimal amount of Rs.5/- for that.

A decent vegetarian joint which is one of the most popular picks amongst the residents of Salt lake when it comes to breakfast. Being a frequent visitor I have tried a majority of the items that the menu offers. From the such , the cheese masala dosa, idly, kulhad chai, schezwan dosa and aloo paratha with aloo dum are my favourites. 
The dosa is ominously huge and two of those are enough for three people. These come with sambar, coconut and pudina chutney. 
They have a good spread but they need to work on the pace with which the orders are served .

I ordered Pav Bhaji via Zomato from here. I placed the order at 9am. It showed around 1hr for delivery. Around 10 when the order wasn't delivered yet, I informed Zomato and in turn they called up the restaurant. The restaurant informed the order was en route. The restaurant now called me up asking for directions. After waiting for half an hour I informed Zomato again. The response from the restaurant remained same, en route. Around 11 I got my ordered delivered. This doesn't stop here. Along with this order I was to get a complimentary dessert as I am a Zomato Treats member. I didn't get that. On informing Zomato they assured me of a callback from the restaurant. It never came. When Zomato contacted the restaurant they blatantly lied that they called but I didn't receive it. Further calls to the restaurant by me and Zomato went unanswered. I have ordered from Zomato a number of times but never faced such a scenario. A simple dish like Pav Bhaji takes 2hr to be prepared and then delivered, lying one after another about being out for delivery and then most importantly shamelessly accusing the customer. Tasteless food can still be accepted, but characterless people can't be. Neither am I happy with Zomato management. They too showed slack response. As of now the only thing that Zomato gave was assurance. Assurance against action against this restaurant, and cancellation of my Treat membership. I don't know of the first one but the second hasn't been carried out yet. Foodies choose wisely before ordering from here.

One of my favourite breakfast places in Saltlake is Gangotri. A good breakfast fuels your day and Gangotri's chole bathure does that to me. It's heavenly. This place has a perfect blend of Indian flavours. It's small but maintained and hygienic. There is nothing fancy about their food or ambience but fills your tummy in pocket friendly price. üòä

Pathetic and Rude Behavior from Restaurant. Order Rejected at First. When called, behaves rudely saying I have not provided address and phone number to Zomato hence they rejected. I am not a first time Zomato user and I regularly use the app for deliveries. My address n phone number is properly updated. The guy further added they tried calling Zomato repeatedly for my address but Zomato didn't respond. Such Lies..!! The guy insists I should place orders directly to them n NOT through Zomato. I have the entire conversation recorded and shared on Social Media tagging Zomato. Aditya from Zomato called and said it's a legal violation to the agreement and they are looking into it. All this happened at the early morning when I tried ordering breakfast. Such arrogant behavior is really shocking and not to be tolerated. One can listen the conversation on Facebook following the hash tag #Gangotri.

Extremely ordinary food, Lack of clean and hygienic eating environment, bad ambience,
Annoyingly poor service and unnecessary high price makes Gangotri an unimpressive place to eat out.
Visited this place on a number of occasions, tried out their Paper Masala Dosa and Dahi Vada, which are the only saving grace of Gangotri.
The Dosa is usually cooked properly, however it takes around 30-32 minutes to reach your table and thus tests your patience.

The other dishes are horrible, as from time to time I experimented with Pizza, Burger and Pasta, which all failed to match my level of expectations.

Probably the best Chola Bhatura and Kesar jalebis you can get in Salt Lake. There are special thanks also in case you are in the mood for something more substantial. It's been our favourite for ages...

Extremely ordinary food, Lack of clean and hygienic eating environment, bad ambience,
Annoyingly poor service and unnecessary high price makes Gangotri an unimpressive place to eat out.
Visited this place on a number of occasions, tried out their Paper Masala Dosa and Dahi Vada, which are the only saving grace of Gangotri.
The Dosa is usually cooked properly, however it takes around 30-32 minutes to reach your table and thus tests your patience.

The other dishes are horrible, as from time to time I experimented with Pizza, Burger and Pasta, which all failed to match my level of expectations.

Gangotri is located near the Baisakhi swimming pool, just opposite to Santa's Fantasea. Tried their ice creams, which are pretty good. The space for indoor accomodation isn't large. There are like four tables with no room for walking in between. Good for takeaways or small bites. The staff at the counter is courteous. Even after finishing our food, we sat there for a few minutes and nobody complained about it.

Gangotri is one of the oldest joints in Salt Lake . We have been visiting this place since our school days . The interior & decor has undergone complete change . The sitting area is small but is quite popular among locals for a friend or family get-together. We mainly visit or order for home delivery their Dosas . The Dosas are nicely cooked , crisp & the associated Sambar & dal are really good .The packing for home delivery is very impressive with Dosas retaining their crispiness despite the travelling time . At one time they almost had a monopoly business in Salt Lake , times have changed & Salt Lake now has many joints serving similar items but Gangotri still retains its charm .

Gangotri is the first place I think of
Pros -
1. Since I was a kid, My family used to order food for Festive Occasions from Gangotri! 
2. Laccha paratha or Idly/Dosa and cola float have been their highlight all these years..!
3. It's Home Delivery is within 30 minutes
4. Amazing food quality.
5. The food is extremely economical, compared to most restaurants around in Salt lake!
6. Eco lunch pack is custom made. They change the Sabzis daily if I am regular in ordering!
7. If I wanna go in for an early breakfast around 7 am. Gangotri is pretty much the only place with fresh Kachori Sabzi. For all the morning Walkers and School kids hurrying, Gangotri is perfect!
8. They put in a lot of extra "cheese" and "chocolate " free of cost if you tell them :)

This restaurant is located near Swimming pool in Salt lake area. It is a small air conditioned vegetarian joint. This place is very close to my heart because we used to spend a lot of time here during our school days. Tried lot of their items like Masala dosa, Chilli cheese toast, Badam milk shake, Chole Bhatura, Idly and last but not the least 'Expresso coffee'( used to be our favourite).
Food is good and the service is commendable. Prices are also reasonable.......

Well, I am quite surprised at myself ‚Äì since I knew nothing about this gem of a place although they have been in business for 25 odd years ‚Äì and me being an erstwhile Saltlake resident as well as an erstwhile CF Swimming pool member. As usual, I am thankful to the Zomato search engine for unveiling this place to me!

These guys are based near the CF block Swimming pool ‚Äì obviously, a prime location in Saltlake and a popular hang-out. Although, the place looks quite promising from the outside, but that‚Äôs not the case once you enter this place. Seating area is quite small and can accommodate only 12-14 people ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know how they handle weekend rush hours! Water is served in plastic glasses and for subsequent refills, a plastic bottle is available.

They serve varied beverages, ice creams, fast food, south indian, continental as well as north indian. We started off with their club kachori ‚Äì which was fine, but paper thin. Sabzi served was also fine. Next, we went for idly, which was soft and served with dry chutney, white narikel chutney as well as sambhar. This also was good, although, sambhar should have been piping hot. We also had masala dosa, which was good in size and masala content being good.

Moving on, samosa with chutney was sub-lime, superb aloo content, balanced masala content and also some peas - should have had scores of it! The cutlet was however, a major turn off and completing the same was quite tasking in itself.

Lastly, came the show-stopper ‚Äì their kulhad chai ‚Äì well it certainly proves that God exists ‚Äì need I say more ‚Äì no, I don‚Äôt think so.

Service is good and ambience is not good. They definitely require a whole lot of more publicity and advertisement. Prices are quite reasonable.

Overall, this place gets a recommendation from me.

Ordered for a grilled veg sandwich,Pau  bhaji,Idli , vada and jalebi for breakfast.All the items were freshly made and hot when delivered.
The grilled sandwich is a double layered one with cheese and veggies . Quite a heavy one for breakfast.The Pau bhaji was again very fresh,bhaji had a perfect sourness, and the pau was grilled with right amount of butter,not too greasy.The vada and idli both were fluffy and the sambhar served with it really tastes nice.The coconut chutney was a bit watery and lacked flavour.They serve another thick chutney made of coconut and curry leaves which was really tasty.The jalebi dissapointed me,firsltly the name is kesariya jalebi and each costs 15 rupees which is quite high compared to other stores,but there was not a pinch of kesar flavour in it.Though it was crispy and juicy and tasted good.

After reading the reviews, wasn't expecting much from this place. However, it turned out to be quite a surprise. Ordered in a masala dosa and Gangotri Special thali. Well, the order took more than an hour to come. That's a negative. Coming to the food, the masala dosa was good enough. The coconut chutney and the sambar was nice. It wasn't too sour as it usually is from most of the places. 
The thali had one kulcha, one lachcha paratha, pulao, Dal makahni, paneer butter, mixed veg, chole, dahi vada, papad, gulab jamun and achaar. The kulcha was soft and delicious. The lachcha paratha was more like a papad. Pulao was bland and lacked taste. Infact it was just steamed rice with a few bits of vegetables thrown in it. I liked the mixed veg, paneer and the dal makhani. The chole had too much masala in it. And it had that raw smell. The dahi vada didn't seem fresh. Loved the gulab jamun. It wasn't too sweet. Overall the meal was good enough. Good value for money.

This restaurant is near CAP Camp.  This is the worst restaurant anyone can go in Saltlake . They use 2 rs ingredients in their food . Ordered a cheesy garlic bread , they served the normal milk break available in the market with some butter and low quality cheese . There veg thali was even worse , street food served near city center is better than this . Had a worst dining experience with this restaurant . They should understand the concept of selling more to increase profit not by degrading quality .

Cons- half of the menu were not available when we went there so we had to choose within very few lists.It was radhaballavi with sabji,and masala dosa that we had chosen.A very clumpsy place also
PROS-  Food was very TASTY ,service was fast, taxes exclusive Quantity was also good.
The absurd thing about this place is they didnot include tax in the radhaballavis but included tax in dosa.the question remains unanswered.
Anyway it will be RECOMMENDED by every veggies

Tried a thali here recently., Parantha thali to be exact. Paranthas were good, pulao was OK, paneer butter masala was disappointing, dal makhani was very good, mix veg and Chole were okayish, and sweet and raita were delicious. Overall, pricing was on the higher side considering the quantity and quality of food they serve. The place is quite small and thus it automatically fails to be a family lunch/dinner spot. 
Can be a good hangout place coz they have items like coffee, pizzas, burgers, nachos and shakes. I would have given it 2.5 but an extra 0.5 for the hospitality. Waiters take good care of your needs. Might visit again as it's the closest to my workplace.

Well this particular friend of mine is very conservative , he is totally weird to be honest , he eats veg on Tuesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday its like almost every day he eats veg and to make it worse he forces his friends to eat veg too which is damn annoying , so after he requested me a hundred times to visit a veg restaurant I told him to take me to one.
He then took me here to Gangotri , ambience was okay not that good.
I went for Cheese Masala Dosa , Pau Bhaaji and Lemon Juice.
Cheese Masala Dosa was not good felt stale and cheese was bitter.
Pau Bhaaji was average and Lemon Juice was good.
Overall an average experience and I'm not going out with this guy ever again.

Much like Scoop, Gangotri happens to be an establishment located at Swimming Pool since long! I do now know the exact year this came up, but I am seeing Gangotri from early 2000, or may be even before. Reaching here, is pretty easy. You need to get down at Baisakhi Swimming Pool, and walk towards Dominos Pizza/Chowman. This restaurant will fall to your left.

As they say, it is hard to maintain the quality with time and this place has been a victim to the same. The Dosa and Sambhar they serve have a sour taste, the Chola Baturas ain't too good either. I, however do like their Sandwiches and Shakes. If you are in a mood for some coffee, you could visit this place as well! The pricing is a bit high compared to the quality of the food they serve.

The restaurant isn't that spacious. Furthermore, the huge glass table-tops makes it hard. The waiters are usually courteous but at times they ignore the customers. With so many other Vegetarian and South Indian offers nearby, this isn't usually at the top of my list.

Near baisakhi.... Sector 1. The place is OK types as many of them say..... Prices are pretty on the steeper side compared to what gautams and others in that vicinity has to offer. We generally went there for dosa and idlis and sometimes coffee, which is good. 

Place is little cramped as the table glass tops are awkwardly big. So the sitting place when full is kinda, difficult to navigate..... 
Staff is courteous.

It's a great choice of you are looking for good vegetarian food. Considering the ambience, the prices are slightly high but, the taste and the quality are very good. I would recommend the chola bhatura, vada and chocolate shake. Another good thing is that it opens at 7am so, those of you looking to catch an early breakfast could stop by for a quick munch here.

Located near the swimming pool in Salt Lake, this place provides a nice vegetarian option amid the so many non-vegetarian eateries. If one is heading from Ultadanga to Baisakhi, then take the right at the Baisakhi circle and when you reach the Corporation bank, this outlet is one of the three shops from the corner.

I have never dined-in here, it has been either a pick-up or home delivered affair. This place provides good breakfast options. They have a nice South Indian fare on offer with many variations of idlis, dosas, vadas and uttapams. They also have the set meals and other cuisine.

I have tried their South Indian fare and it is good. Just that they need to maintain constancy with the preparations. The dishes tend to vary in taste. The set meals are tasty and filling but somehow I would not recommend them. They are really greasy and somehow did not seem high on the quality front. They leave a thick layer of grease on the plate. Apart from this I have tasted the pasta once and it was okay.

Overall they provide good breakfast options. One can try the South Indian fare. The delivery time is moderate. The quantities served are good and prices are on the lower side. Just that they need to be a bit more conscious about quality.

Happy eating!!

It's a great choice of you are looking for good vegetarian food. Considering the ambience, the prices are slightly high but, the taste and the quality are very good. I would recommend the chola bhatura, vada and chocolate shake. Another good thing is that it opens at 7am so, those of you looking to catch an early breakfast could stop by for a quick munch here.

Located near the swimming pool in Salt Lake, this place provides a nice vegetarian option amid the so many non-vegetarian eateries. If one is heading from Ultadanga to Baisakhi, then take the right at the Baisakhi circle and when you reach the Corporation bank, this outlet is one of the three shops from the corner.

I have never dined-in here, it has been either a pick-up or home delivered affair. This place provides good breakfast options. They have a nice South Indian fare on offer with many variations of idlis, dosas, vadas and uttapams. They also have the set meals and other cuisine.

I have tried their South Indian fare and it is good. Just that they need to maintain constancy with the preparations. The dishes tend to vary in taste. The set meals are tasty and filling but somehow I would not recommend them. They are really greasy and somehow did not seem high on the quality front. They leave a thick layer of grease on the plate. Apart from this I have tasted the pasta once and it was okay.

Overall they provide good breakfast options. One can try the South Indian fare. The delivery time is moderate. The quantities served are good and prices are on the lower side. Just that they need to be a bit more conscious about quality.

Happy eating!!

This is my childhood Sunday breakfast shop! Ah I have fond memories here.... The food has degraded pathetically now. Any onion dosa would be a disaster here... It would be full of raw onions. The raw dosas are always raw. Their kachori in the morning is still edible though. I wish they could keep up their standard :(

Thought of cheating my regular cornflakes and oats breakfast for some South Indian and oily breakfast. Only thing I liked was club Kachori which was good. The onion masala dosa was very bad. I didn't expect crispness as I ordered to home but the dosa and all chutney are so sour must be left over from last night or God knows one couldn't take the 2nd bite. Service was pathetic too. So 1.5 for club Kachori rest all a big zero. Better to avoid.

I have always heard from people that for south indian food in salt lake visit gangotri. Tried this place three times and everytime i was disappointed because everytime they had put more salt either in dosa batter or the masala which made it difficult to eat.Chutney and sambhar which they server nowhere matches the south indian way both are very watery.
Apart from this have tried club kachori and chats they were tasty .

I tried Dosa and Idly here today and so far it was the best i had in kolkata, thats my personal opinion as people from different parts of country have diff taste for south india food. This was special for me because it was like the one I used to eat in Delhi or Agra. Full makkhan maar ke style. Tasty sambhar and nariyal chutney was just awesome. Next time When I'll think abt dosa/idly, this is the place for me

This is not a typical place to have a full course meal, like lunch or dinner. But Gangotri offers many varieties of cross cuisine snacks items. The place would be ideal for a quick catch up with your friend over a breakfast or the evening meal. The place is quite small, having seats for hardly 15 people one may not find a place in the evenings. I have been to this place this place mostly to have a small meal with tea. Their tea is good enough so as the food. I have tried Radha Ballavi and Puri with Alu dam, which were decent. Service is also Ok. Awaiting to try their South Indian foods. :)

Over all food and it's presentation was good. However, for a large group place is quite small. They can do with little expansion.

After the meal I was fully content . The dishes are reasonably priced and service is excellent.The ambience is also good .
I would suggest this place for a good simple veg meal that is healthy and value for money.

Been ordering from them since I moved to Salt Lake back in April, mostly because I don't have a kitchen and they're the only place in the neighbourhood that delivers breakfast. I've been a very regular customer, and the staff here have always been extremely rude, but still I persisted because I didn't have a choice. 

Today I wanted to order breakfast, but they refused to deliver unless the order went above a certain amount, even though they didn't have any items that I wanted, other than what I already ordered. I live literally round the corner from them too. I asked them if it wouldn't be possible to deliver with the existing order as I'm a regular customer, and I live so nearby. They refused, and when I said I wouldn't be ordering from them, the man literally said 'whatever' (apki marzi) and hung up.

Needless to say, they're not getting my money again.

great masala dosas, thali is also very much value for money but dont ever order polao and paneer dishes paneer was not fresh at all and the polao is just plain rice, so, this two things happened to be disastrous but the dosas here just blown me away.. and pls dont order dessert, its not quite you think of, but you have sufficient money, u can go for it. the dam alu and kaali daal and raita in the thali were just too good..
overall if you wanna hangout with friends and not in a mood to spend much and moreover if you are in a mood to have veg then this place no doubt is a great option.

Simply the worst food. We went there and ordered chola botora. They kept us waiting for more than 30 minutes. Then when they served us, chola was missing.
When we enquired, they told us that they where out of chola, so they served us with alu puri.But they told us that we would have to pay the price of chola botora(which was higher) since they had already made the bill.¬†

This is the first time i have seen something like this. I just want to tell everyone that if you have love for food, then dont go there.

I found this place is getting younger lately! This veg food joint has stood the test of time and today it has got equal craze and pull which it used to have years back, maybe with time it has only tried to improve itself. The interior looks contemporary and neat, the place may think of increasing some sitting capacity though. It has got its set of old loyal clients and it always keeps on adding to that list. Whenever I am at this place I try to have the Masala Dosa if not the Idlis or Vadas. Their Dosas are simple, light yet tasty. Team it up with some hot coffee or some Kwality Wall's ice-cream to finish off. A great place to have some quick ¬†veggie snacks on the go. Try it out! Cheers!

Dhosa and idly are the speciality.One can try different type of dhosas everytime.chats are also very good.nice place to have a quiet veggie affair with family. Coffee and teas are not that great.The veg Thali is a really nice option.Sufficient for a single person.

This place has been here since forever. And it has evolved ever since. This joint is not too big but has quite some tables, its an AC restaurant with swift service. Recently when my father craved to eat south Indian food I called Gangotri up and ordered a Sambar Vada, Idli and Chana Kulcha. It reached after an hour, the total was quite reasonable and cheap. I liked the way the food was packed. There were 3 kinds of chutney with a samabar, then salad and pickle along with the chana kulcha. 
The south Indian food here is anyways always very well made. The vada was nice and well fried and tasted quite good. The chutneys were a treat as well and the sambar surprisingly was still warm and tasted nice and tangy like it should. The kulchas unfortunately has become hard, its best served immediately so my bad. I expected the chana to be be better, I expected to be dry, but nonetheless it was grazy based and very spicy not that am complaining about that, tasted very well with the pickle and the salad. There were two kulchas served along with it.
This place opens up at 7am for breakfast as well. I would also recommended everyone to try their breakfast special club kachoris. They are just great for the sunday veg morning breakfasts.

It is just alright to have food here in case you are very hungry and need to eat some snacks. I do not like the ambience as such although I admit it has been a few years since I last visited thisplace. I had south indian food, namely masala dosa and I liked it. I did not enjoy the ambience at that point of time and I never really cared to go back but I guess it is alright if you want a quick bite!

Club kachori and kesar jelabi to start your day. Splendid Cheese dosa for snack, their legenday meals for lunch along with shakes or lassi, Mouth watering chats for eveing snack and chana batora and sambar vada for dinner. Gangotri serves all the Salt lake for almost two decades ( I still remember their opening in 1993/94). Wonderful home delivery, huge queue on sunday morning for kachori and jelabi, amazingly tasty veg food. I am a fan of Anand too (in CR Ave), I believe Gangotri is doing similar kind of service in and around salt lake. Great is only one word which absolutely does not fully describe their quality and service. My personal favourite.

Gangotri is another restaurant I share my neighbourhood with.This place has been renovated over time but it is not that impressive.The food prices are tolerable .The system of serving the food is little odd as you have to order the food at the counter with cash then waiter comes with your order.The food is good though specially pau bhaji, club kachori and raj kachori.The best tasting food there is the Paper plain cheese dosa.It is a must try for all foodie like me.

A decent place to eat sunday brinch from. the chhola bhatoora is decent and so is the club kachori. 

do not like sitting there and eating.. usually prefer parcels. the ambiance is slightly on the loud side. 

what i like the most on their menu is raj kachori. even the dahi wadas a re very soft and nice.  but if u parcel it, it may go soggy.. so best if it is eaten here. the food is fresh . the south indian is decent but i dont like the sambhar here. 

over a decent place. very pocket friendly .
