Oh the pizza's and wine üòç
This place is a pinch in your pocket but if you love pizza pasta and wine you wont bother when the bill comes in.. 
They have amazing staff really loving and considerate staff. They are helpful with the menu and quick with the serving. 
Pizza takes a little longer but it is worth all the wait while you sip on the exotic wine collection they have. I have been 100% satisfied with the food and everything

Courteous service and good food. Loved the prawns and the chocolate mousse. The mousse especially was well set and the perfect dark chocolate. I also adored the kafir lime and tequila cocktail. Would definitely recommend.

Again one of the bad experiences in somewhat overhyped restaurant housed in an upscale mall of Kolkata. 

I visited this joint for the 1st time anticipating that the restaurant will live up to the hype. 

We ordered a veg pizza, called Verdure 9" (since the menu had limited vegetarian options). It tasted less than ordinary, pizza hut or dominos can easily bulldoze such pizza from a "speciality Italian restaurant from NY" which is their tagline. After a wait for 20-25 minutes from the time of placing order, the pizza was actually slammed on the table by the waiter, who didn't even bother to mention anything close of hospitality. Paid Rs 649/- (including 10% of service charge and GST). 

Summary of my ratings below:

Ambience 4/5
Food quality 2/5
Value for money -ve
Service 1/5
Visiting again -ve
Recommend to others -ve (unless one has enough money to spend on worthless food)

We went to have lunch on the day of Durga Saptami.
The decorations were pretty elegant with all the wines and spirits displayed magnifitely.
The staff were professional and friendly.
We had items from their chef special menu but I can't recall their names at the moment.
For drinks we had kiwi Cran Mojito and Kafir lime Margarita which were excellent no doubt.
The food items were delicious but lacked in quantity somehow and I wasn't full totally.

So overall ratings are
Decor-5/5
Management-4.5/5
Food Quality-5/5
Value for Money-3/5

Located on the top floor of the Quest mall, Serafina is a high end restaurant which spells italian in terms of the decor and menu! We reached there around 4pm so couldn't go for the big Apple brunch as we had planned initially. So settled for the ala carte instead.
Order-- ordering the food was no easy job. In spite of being someone who eats out quite regularly, I found the menu a tad too complicated!
However, we settled for a chicken and mushroom pizza and the grilled chicken pillard. (For 2)
Food-- let me get this straight. The pizza here is amongst my top 5 pizzas EVER! It's huge and it's heavenly. The crust is neither too thin nor too thick and it tastes straight out of an Italian kitchen.
The grilled chicken pillard is another amazing dish both in look and taste. It's basically two huge chicken breasts stone grilled and served with veggies.
Pocket pinch-- this Is the part where it really hurt. A total of 2300 INR for two people and for two dishes! Talk about burning a hole in the pocket.
Overall-- recommended if you have no qualms in spending a lot of money in a special date!

Do you have black money? You have fear to be ceased by the Income Tax? Welcome to Serafina. 
The food was delicious of course (has to be), but overpriced- almost twice as expected. Quantity wasn't enough, sorry to say! The staffs were cordial and the decor was amazing. It got noisy as the night progressed. The extra 0.5 star is for the scooter outside.

Great food. We sat outside. Felt like we were sitting in some roadside cafe in Europe. Had tomato and chicken soup. Serafina chicken salad, chefs special seafood risotto and pizza with imported mozarella. We were too full in the end as this was supposed to be an evening meal. Quantity sufficient for two people. Food-great and authentic with imported and best ingredients as described. A tad on the expensive side but, to be expected. Ambience-fantastic. Service - well informed and prompt.

Located above the food court of Quest Mall, good Italian delicacy. Interior is quite simple though it gives a lavish look. The price you pay for such food is very high. So the value of money is less. Service was quick. We ordered and they served us withing 5-7 minutes. We had ordered the following items:
1. Crostini di verdure
2. Zuppa di pomodori con crema e basilico
3. Mexican Mojito 
4. Pinky paradise mojito
5. Ravioli 
6. Potato wedges with arrabiatta sauce and lemonade
They served us bread and butter as complimentary. 
Mojito were very refreshing. Food is delicious. Quantity and quality was good.

So I just returned from this place. To get it straight I was simply disappointed. I had extremely high expectations from this place. After today's visit I must say I seriously don't get what this hype is all about. We opted for the set meal that comes for 899 + tax. It has starter, soup, main course, pizza/pasta and dessert. I will start with what went wrong. So we were obviously asked whether we want regular water or bottled water. We said we want bottled water. Now by bottled water they have two options.
1. Your regular kinley
2. A bottle of imported mineral water.

Now they didnt tell us about it and straight up brought the imported mineral water and the waiter said , 'take this ma'am, it tastes good,its imported from Bhutan.'

Seriously? What do people mean by it tastes good. Water is supposed to taste like water. And guess what? It costs 249 bucks without tax.

For cocktail there was Cosmopolitan for me which was sweet like candy. It was disappointing.
The main course was super less in quantity. The only savng grace was the pizza which was palatable. For dessert I opted for chocolate mousse. They served it in a shot glass.It made me very angry.

Also they give an assortment of breads in a basket complimentary. The bread that they served us were cold and dry. They didn't give us butter with it while they did give butter to the table next to us.

Now coming to the bill, it came to 2649/-

They added 210 bucks as service charge apart from 400 bucks GST

When we told the waiter , what is the service charge for, his reply was - 'Pay if you CAN'
You should really be saying 'Pay if you WANT TO.'

I dont understand this restaurant. They wouldnt let us get away even if we paid one buck less but then they will slyly add 200 bucks service charge without even consulting thinking the customer will overlook. What kind of hospitality this is, is beyond me. Very disappointed with quantity of food and service.

Located opposite to yauatcha in quest mall above the food court this a very nice italian eatery.
We went for the big apple brunch on a sunday which came along with a pocket pinch of 999+gst.
The brunch menu is very tastefully designed which comes along with a glass of complimentary wine (white or red as per your choice)/breezers/mocktails.
We ordered almost everything from the menu.
1.)pancakes
2.)fresh fruit bowl
3.)sunny side up with minced chicken sausages 
4.)scrambled eggs with grilled chicken and mashed potatoes
5.) Boiled eggs served in shot glasses
For the soup we went for a cream of chicken soup.
For the starters we ordered fried calmari and chicken.
Here you have the independance to customise your own pizza and pastas. So happy choosing peepsüòÑ.
We were full by the time yhe desserts came we ordered all the dessert which are present on the buffet menu which included:-
1. Tiramisu
2. Pannacota cheese cake
3. Creme burle√®
4. Bread pudding.
Initially the service was slow, we were also early for the buffet but later the service picked up speed and really won hearts.
The suggestions and the behaviour of the waiters endears this place to you.
So, if u are looking to brunch sipping on wine and having authentic italian food this place should be on your list.
Special mention to their freshly baked breads that are served. Very soft freshly baked in the oven.

I went here a few days ago for a quick bite since my husband and I had just landed in kolkata. The salad we ordered was superb and I'm surely coming back for it. However what was disappointing was the drinks we ordered ... the red wine sangaria in ordered was very very unlike a red wine sangria, tasted more  like fruit juice and had too much fizz... I took that its probably how they make it here but I requested the gentleman assisting us to modify it as per my taste as I was really craving a good sangaria but t my surprise I was asked to try something else as they do not customise the drink .... on insisting he claimed to have modified it but it tasted just the same .... we had also ordered a cappuccino which I'm assuming should take the least time for perpetration but again I finished my sangaria we both ate the salad and yet the coffee was not there ... since we were In a hurry we asked them to cancel the coffee and get the bill but they again made us wait for 5-6 mins and got the coffee .... honestly we were in no mood to either drink it or argue about giving it back so choose to just gulp it and get going ... so besides the amazing salad, we weren't too impressed with this place !!

I don‚Äôt know what the hype is all about. The place seemed to lack warmth, from the intimidating d√©cor to the hovering concierge who seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. The print of the menu was too clustered making it difficult for us to decide what we wanted. After a few helpful suggestions, we decided on bruschetta, a mushroom ravioli, seafood spaghetti and a polenta chicken. Before all this, of course, we ordered the twisted orange mohito, which was really refreshing. The bruschetta was excellent, a perfect combination of tomatoes and feta on toasted bread, making for mouthwatering bites. The mushroom ravioli was very tasty as well. The seafood spaghetti was too rustic for us, the tomato sauce overpowered the entire dish, making us want to keep changing our palette after every two bites. The chicken in the polenta chicken was also dry and smelled like it had been refrigerated for too long before it had been tossed in butter, plus, the butter was salty enough, adding capers to it kind of made the salt overpowering. Having said that, the polenta was delicious, flavorful in every bite and very filling. I would go back just to taste the polenta again, not caring much for the chicken. We didn‚Äôt have any space left for dessert, and even if we did, I‚Äôm pretty sure we would want to have it elsewhere. Serafina was a one time experience and a mediocre one at that. If they change their menu, we might want to go back to try the same, but not until then.

One of the best place to have authentic Italian delicacy. Interior is quite simple through it gives a lavish look. Waiting staffs are very polite and know very well how to handle a fussy üò≠ guest like my brother.
Ordered capriosca, bloodymary, bruschetta and a classic üçï. The entire spread was mouthwatering however the pizza was outstanding in taste.

We went to Serafina to witness the launch of the Sunday Brunch with some of our fellow bloggers. 
The interiors are gorgeous and very nicely done. The decor gives the restaurant a very lavish outlook which it already is! 
Coming over to food!
For starters, we had the bruchetta and carrot & ginger soup. The soup was really good and creamy.
Then we tried the fruit salad and the regular veggy salad. Both were fresh and was prepared in front of us.
Next up was the thin crust pizza and we two varieties of it. Both were equally delicious and cheesy.
Then we tried the flat pasta in creamy red sauce, panne in cheese sauce and spaghetti in pesto sauce! We must, all of these were spectacular, our top pick being the one in creamy tomato sauce!
Next was risotto again in creamy tomato sauce with loads of exotic veggies. It was purely a heart winner! Perfectly cooked rice with flavours bursting our mouth!
Finally we moved over to desserts, where we tasted The Tiramisu, Cr√®me Brulee and Short cake. We would definitely choose Tiramisu our of all these! It was divine and triple amazing. It was the best Tiramisu we have ever had till date. 

Overall, Serafina is the perfect place to take your partner to and enjoy some delicious food along with some wine!

Food: Tried the serafina chicken salad and it was really good with the right amount of olive oil and salt and spices. Be sure to try the Long island iced tea cocktail they serve. 

Ambience: The interior is usually quiet and peaceful with light music playing in the background. The colors are mostly shades of white amd beige. Very calming and they light a small candle on your table which surely adds to the effect. 

Service: Staff is courteous and friendly and very well mannered. They are all in uniform.

Went there ¬†with my date due to my genuine love and enthusiasm in Italian cuisine. We ordered Calamari and Beef Salami as starters with Campari as the aperitif. The Calamari was crunchy and chewy but nothing was new in the salami. The Campari was ¬†unexpectedly bitter but worth trying Italian Aperitif for the first time. In the main course, the Pizza a pollo e funghi was thin crust as per Italian tradition. The Fillet Mignon ¬†reminded me of home cooked game Venison in the Netherlands, juicy and savoury. I thought Brunello would be a perfect match to wash it down but ordered Prosecco instead, The softness of the Venetian sparkling was a total bliss. In the end, The Tiramisu was the final satisfaction. We expected Creme brulee but changed to Panna Cota due to unavailability. The overall ¬†service was quick and the staff were courteous and attentive. The ambience was relatively dull for such a good restaurant but that cann't hide its gastronomical elegance.

Service:5/5
Service was quick. Excellent and attentive staff.Kept our request of serving us the desserts in a hurry.Kept our little table as mess free as possible.

Ambience:4.5/5
Our seat was right by the glass wall.The dimly lit interiors with the wine cellar behind, illuminated by the golden light feels pretty romantic.

Food:5/5 in quantity.NONE OF THE DISHES TWO OF US, ADULTS, COULD FINISH! (EXCEPT THE PIZZA AND DESSERTS THOUGH)
4.5/5 in taste.
They served us bread and butter, complimentary.
Then they started serving us what we ordered within about 10minutes!
Fried Calamari: really tasty,crunchy.A bit too crunchy for my taste but tasty nonetheless.Cooled down too soon and didn't seem as tasty then onwards.

Campari: tasted REALLY bitter and kinda disgusting,like tonic .I had to swish water in my mouth to remove the aftertaste.
Prosecco: Beautiful.A little sour,little bitter,little warm.MY first wine! And it was absolutely lovely.
Pina Colada: delicious! Sweet! Too much.couldnt finish...

Carpaccio Di filetto con salsa di tartufi Neri: cold cut,beef, moderately tasty.Tasted more potato than beef.
Beautiful presentation,though.
Pizza a pollo e funghi: thin crust, 12inches,crunchy crust,tasty tasty,though should have had more cheeese.
Filet mignon: tough outside,a little bitter,inside softer, Extremely delicious.A little troublesome cutting up.I WILL FOREVER REGRET NOT BEING ABLE TO FINISH THIS ONE.

Panna cotta: oh my god it's so tasty.Looks like a dollop of cream but..Oh my god.jiggly rich creamy smooth.Had few tiny green grains of something though, probably as their own twist to it.
Tiramisu: this one is a crowd favourite.I lovvved it...It was huuge.took two of us to finish one! Bitter,sweet,creamy tiramisu.If I'm not wrong,tiramisu is not all that creamy.Anyhow,it tasted like coffee,cake,cocoa,cream.All of them,are my favourites.
Expected to taste the mascarpone though..But got mostly that chocolaty bitterness.

Enjoyed our time here, thoroughly. Will come back for their filet mignon and the huge array of drinks to choose from!‚ò∫

Went there on 2nd July for Sunday brunch.  I'm not a quite foodie. But was there for almost 2 hourüò± and tried almost everything on the  buffet.I personally loved every single dishes except the bruschetta. It was not something outstanding. Pasta in pesto sauce, pizza, and mini sliders were exceptionally good. There tiramisu is to die for. They served authentic italian dishes. So it can be tasteless or taste bland for die hard Indian cuisine lover. This is my personal experience as my friend didn't like the food much. Only one drawback, all of their dessert contains egg. 
But overall a great experience for me. Will visit again.

Serafina is one of New York's popular Italian dining restaurants serving authentic Italian cuisine. Located conveniently in the luxury mall Quest in Kolkata, it's known to serve the best pizza in the city.

Ambiance has an air of sophistication, with the chandeliers, bar cabinet, brick-styled walls along with shades of deep red, maroon and pastel earthy tones imparting a touch of elegance to the classy interior.

Service and behavior of staff are extremely praiseworthy. The swiftness and decency of their service is to be noted.

Coming to the food, we ordered the Cappuccino de Fungi soup, that was accompanied with a basket of crisp bread loaves and slabs of creamy butter, and their Pizza Margherita.
The thin-crust pizza was fresh, delish and absolutely pristine authentic. Brimming with homemade fresh mozzarella cheese and topped with San Marzano tomatoes, fresh basil and olives, and coupled with the softness of the base, crunchiness of the crust, and sprinkles of oregano and chilli flakes, the pie was a masterpiece crafted to perfection and exuding the authenticity of an original Italian pizza.

Overall experience here was quite good and satisfactory. There's arrangement for dining outside the restaurant as well. The huge glass walls offer a view of the diners happily eating away outside and also glimpses of the 5th floor.
Serafina has become an internationally renowned phenomenon, and a major global dining destination.The outlet in Kolkata does justice to its name. For those fond of Italian food and for diehard pizza lovers like myself, it is a must try!

Had a lot of expectation from this place. Went for dinner but I am a bit disappointed. The service staffs are very cordial but if you make the mistake of asking for their suggestion you will be trapped as they will suggest you the most expensive dish in the menu and you might end up paying a bomb for something which you might not enjoy.Di Serafina is one such dish (suggested). The pizza is good though it will take hours to come to your table after you have ordered it. Carlsberg is the only beer which is available there though the menu boasts of other brands. I must confess the TIRAMISU is the best here. Restaurant experiance was good. But food can be better. Overall I had a pretty average time in here and a DAMN EXPENSIVE one!!

Its monsoon time and most of us will love to have pizza now.
A beautiful ambience,soothing lights and pretty sitting arrangements,this place is perfect for a nice date.
The food is certainly overpriced here but their pizzas are must try.

‚Ä¢We had a large 12" chicken pizza e pollo funghi.This is the best kind of thin crust pizza we ever had served fresh and hot from the oven.Large chunks of chicken,mushroom,tomatoes and mozarella cheese melting in the mouth is worth having.

‚Ä¢Twisted orange mojito-They suggested to try this mocktail and it was so refreshing and fresh.Mocktail options are less.But give this a try,all orange lovers.

They levy 30% tax and the bill came to be 1.2 k.
Service is prompt and staffs are well behaved.

Went there to meet my best friend after ages practically! My friend is fond of Italian cuisine so we agreed to try this joint! As we entered the hotel we were made to sit outside because we were only two! Then for food we ordered Mista verde, calamari and the Margherita V.I.P. Pizza! And for drinks we ordered fresh lime soda (sweet) The proportions are good for one person, Mista verde is basically a leafy salad ü•ó and would recommend it to pals who are on a diet! The pizza was amazing probably can say the best pizza üçï joint in the city of joy! Overall it was a nice experience! üòá

Service is slow. Waiters though courteous do not listen to you properly. We had gone for the brunch here, 3 of us, whether it is for starters or mains or dessert, he manged to miss one item or the other each time. Food though served hot was very basic. Expected it to be much better.

Perched in the top floor of Quest Mall, Kolkata, Serafina is an Italian Fine Dining restaurant that has already curved out a niche for itself and gained a reputation for serving the best Pizza and Tiramisu in the town for sometime now! Needless to say I was pretty excited when I was invited to be a part of their new menu launch. The new menu retains all the goodness of their previous offerings with a few tweaks here and there that elevates the dining experience a notch higher. The health conscious, the meat lover, the dessert dude‚Ä¶ well I can vouch no one is going home without a smile on their face J

If you go through my list of reviews, you will find that there are only a handful of outright negative ones. This is not a negative review per se, but one that reeks of definite disappointment.

There were four of us and we opted for their Sunday brunch, that includes a complimentary drink, a soup, quite a few appetizers, salads, 4 mains, pizzas, pastas and dessert. So a pretty big spread, you see. Unfortunately the service was a deal breaker. Almost no attention was paid, probably because we were the youngest amongst the guests (?) ; or may be it had something to do with the fact that we were casually dressed (?) and not looking ready enough to break into a red carpet appearance. But then again we were a group of junior doctors coming in a break from our hectic work schedule. Cannes ready, we were not. The delay between each item, despite empty tables and idle chatter, was palpable, especially as others around us got served. To make matters worse, the desserts apparently ran out in the end. So the 4 of us, each paying for an individual brunch received just one creme brulee. No, not one for each. But one for four. And then it ran out. We had to repeatedly call the attendees between each course and even then they were slow. And worse : disinterested.

Coming to the food, peppered between the mediocrity of the mains and the disaster that were the soups were some real highlights. The chicken arabiata , which is basically chunks of well cooked chicken tossed up in spices, deep fried and served with gravy was the highlight among the appetizers. The .pizzas were very good. And their famous Tiramisu was a melt in the mouth delight. As far as the mains are concerned, the Spaghetti squash was the standout. The flavors were delicate with the pine nuts adding a real zing to the proceeding. The rest unfortunately were strictly forgettable.¬†

At the end of the day, the food did not blow my mind but it wasn't bad either. There were a few really good dishes and hence the 3 out of 5. The service however left a lasting sour taste in my mouth which even their Tiramisu, as good as it is, failed to wash away.

This feels like a piece of Europe located on the top floor of the Quest Mall. Posh interiors, exquisite menu n excellent service definitely makes this one of the grade A restaurants in Kolkata. Though the cost is on the higher side bt the over all experience makes it worth it. There are 2 sections for seating - one outside n one inside. Usually it is crowded in the weekend so they might not be able to accommodate u inside bt u can get a place in the outer section. Also if u like to take pics with interesting subjects don't miss the yellow scooter placed outside the restaurant n it is meant for posing n clicking üòä

The pizzas in serafina is exactly how they make it in Italy.  Crisp and thin crusted.  Tried the mini sliders too. The children didn't fancy the berestas or the caramelized onions but I felt they added to the taste.  The Tiramisu was simple out of the world.  The exact mascapone cheese and the right hint of bitterness made this the best Tiramisu in the town.  Recommended.

The word 'Serafina' is the feminine form of 'Serafim' the six winged biblical angels surrounding and praising the throne of God
. The restaurant thus named is located in the 5th floor of Quest Mall and is dubbed as the most authentic Italian food center in town.
I attended their Big Apple Sunday Brunch on 21/05/2017 with two of my childhood friends. We had to wait a few minutes before we were greeted in. They start with one glass of complimentary drink that you can choose from a variety of options - beer/cocktails/mocktails etc. I settled for a refreshing glass of white wine. Next came Bruschetta (grilled breads with tomato toppings) and Veg Crostini (another Italian bread appetizer). Following assorted breads went well with Cream of Chicken Soup that we chose as our soup of the day. On a quick note, these Italian starters may taste a bit bland to the uninitiated foodie. For example we only started gorging our food once the Crispy Fried Calamari (culinary term for Squid in Mediterranean foods) and Arrabiata Spiced Chicken hit the floor ... oops .. I mean our plate! :p Both tasted yummy and crunchy and really tangoed well with our drinks. There are live counters for Omelettes and Salad where you can actually customize your own stuff but we were already enough engrossed in your food to leave our seats. So, we ordered for Mushroom-filled Masaala Omelette and Caesar Salad to be served at our table. I did not like the Omelette at all thought the Salad was okayish. Chicken Sliders with french fries were just out of this world. These sliders are basically mini Burgers that you cannot just stop eating. Grilled Chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes tasted decent as well. ¬†In the main course, we started with Pasta. From the several choices we were presented with, we opted for Spaghetti in White Cream with Chicken and Mushroom. Now this was a tactical blunder that I shall rue till my last breath! :'( This dish was so creamyyyyyyyy and deliciously so that once I was done with it I had no room anymore. The fact that 3 of us could not finish a medium sized thin crust pizza talks a volume about our misery. Mind you there was nothing wrong with the pizza .. in fact it is one of the best pizza I ever had .. the idea of thin crust being quite unique in itself. Being already filled to the brim we could only taste (and unfortunately not devour) the desserts. I loved their signature dessert - Tiramisu - a popular coffee-flavored Italian custard dessert, made of ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. It has this unique cheesy bitterness that blown my mind away. I tasted couple of spoons of other desserts - Panacotta and Br√ªl√©e - taste wise they were fantastic as well.
This was my first ever full course Italian meal and what better way to have it than a sumptuous buffet like this! Quest Mall having a filtered crowd in general the ambiance was also up to my taste. The staff was helpful and courteous in general. There was one minor misunderstanding that resulted in delay of service for a while but soon it was sorted out and the management apologized to us over and over for the same. The only invariable concern is the hole it burns to your pocket! ;)
Thanks Serafina for hosting a great food-centric reunion for our group!
P.S: Thanks

SERAFINA

Soups: 

1)Chicken Mushroom Capuccino: 
A sedate start to a great lunch. Creamy and  frothy as it was promised in the menu card, this soup spoke mushroom. Every gulp let the earthy flavour of the mushroom come out purely and play on your palate. Decorated beautifully with a cream ring on top, this soup definitely preserved its originality. 

2)Chicken Grana Padano: 
This soup was few of those dishes that did not have a special extra touch to it but yet successfully satisfied and fulfilled a clean kick off to a meal. The broth was creamy, buttery and smooth with little pieces of chicken and broccoli dunked inside. It was all about the smoothness of the broth that will leave you going gaga over it. 

Salads: 

1)Classic Caesar Salad: 
A nice Caesar salad, keeping up with crispiness and crunchiness throughout the plate with nice bit of parmesan shaving to add a creamy dimension to its crunchy texture. Had a few bite cubes of chicken that were soft and gooey. Worth having. 

2)Insalat Marinara: 
One of those trophy salads that you go on searching for. Crispy lettuce leaves teamed up with soft gooey croutons and few pieces of pickled squid and a small piece of fish.The seafood was cooked to perfection and the tangy touch that the pickle lent to it really uplifted this dish.

Must try Starters: 

1)Herb Grilled Chicken: 
This one showcases a fusion of two classic cuisines ‚Äï Italian and Thai. While the chicken was put on thin sticks and grilled to make them perfect skewers, the white sauce glaze and touch of parmesan brought back the taste from southern europe. Soft, gooey and absolutely satisfying.

 2)BBQ Pork Sausage: 
This dish had something that you will rarely find anywhere, at least in this city - perfectly grilled pork. Soft, gooey on the inside with a little bit of pull on the outside, the pork retained its texture and yet the skewers were melt in the mouth soft. Intermittently little pieces of pineapples were spaced between the pork on the skewer stick to give a nice break to the meat monotony 

Mains: 

1)Pollo Arabiatta: 
A generous piece of chicken, cooked well with a drenching of the classic arabiatta sauce. Served with mashed potatoes on the side. Had nothing of a wow factor to it but was good. 

2)Pollo Parmagiano: 
This was probably the only dish that let this amazing meal down. Two pieces of chicken deep fried and served up with pickled leaves. The chicken wasn't cooked well and the most irritating thing about it was the weird crunch on the outside. The crust outside is of something thats hard to decipher but destroys every bite with a feeling of a mouthful of sand in it. Not recommended. 

Pizza Agnello: 
Thin crust pizza,with a nice crunchy base covered up with a generous layer of parmesan and topped with chunks of lamb that were cooked to perfection. A classic Italian Pizza and worthy giving a try. 

Pasta Penne Alla Vodka: 
It was the definitely the trophy dish of the day. Classic penne pasta with house speciality tomato sauce, an abundance of parmesan and generous supplements of chicken cubes, this pasta is as good as it gets. We can definitely go to the extent of recommending this pasta as to be better than any other in town.

Desserts:

Lemongrass Creme brule: 
The thin caramelised sugar layer on top did not have the crack you would be expecting from a classic creme brule. But overall it was nice. The hint of lemongrass a nice touch to a classic dessert.

Gooey Brownie: 
There cannot be anything better than a perfectly baked brownie. And we definitely got that. It was the perfect amount of crunchy and soft and a delight in every bite.

We were served a complimentary bread basket having assorted freshly baked bread.

Sadly we didn't get to have their famous tiramisu, but there is always next time!

Serafina is an amazing experience that comes at a price. But it is absolutely worth it.

Cost for 2: Rs 2000

Offers: 6 course meal for 1 with complimentary drink (Wine/Sangria/Ice Tea) @ Rs799 + taxes

Located on the top floor of Quest mall, this was one restaurant which was in my list for long.
Food:
The place maintains a very high quality when it comes to the food and drink it serves. We ordered Calamari as appetizer. The sauce which they served was really tasty, though I believe the Calamari fry could have been a little better. At least when it comes to having tasted it at Chilli's. For drinks we ordered Lychee & Ginger Mojito and Sherley's Temple and both were prepared very well.
We had Chicken Breast Paillard and ¬†another chicken dishfrom their Chef's special menu. One thing worth mentioning is the portion size - which is really filling. I believe they are an expert in sauce preparation, as the sauces always tasted simply delicious.

Service:¬†
The service is a little slow and mismanaged. May be it was a sunday and the place was full, the attendants had a difficult time in maintaining pace. They served the bread basket but forgot to get the olive oil \ butter. We had to ask twice to get that.

Price:
The plates are priced a little on the higher side. The final bill exceeds expectation as they impose Service charge and service tax both beside VAT.

Eating in a fine dining restaurant can be either an exhilarating experience or an effort in futility. Fortunately, Serafina was an enjoyable experience. located in Quest mall, one can expect that the prices will be on the higher side. Unfortunately, Serafina is a little pricey but their quality of food and service justify the expenditure.

The decor is very minimal with the walls almost bare of decorations. Overtly decorated and in-your-face decor is an instant turn off for me. The staff were courteous and well informed about what they were serving. It is rare in Kolkata that the staff know the menu well and can describe the food for you. Kudos to Serafina for well trained staff.

As for the food, we ordered Non vegetarian Antipasti Misto for starters with Ginger and Lychee Mojito mocktail and a Manhattan cocktail. The mocktail was good. The Manhattan was just the right amount of bitter but instead of the traditional cherry, they garnish it with orange rind. The alcohol content was also decent.

The anitpasto misto was enough for two people and it can be quite filling. For our main course, we ordered grilled norwegian salmon with green peas mash and broccoli and braised beef with jacket potatoes and aragula. The salmon was cooked almost to perfection. the green peas mash was just right and not too soggy. ¬†the beef was medium rare as per my specification. the portion sizes are good and filling.

overall, the whole experience was pleasant and notwithstanding the pocket pinch, Serafina does carve out a comfortable place for themselves in the good restaurants pantheon.

Really great ambience and food. We had chicken salad, pasta, tiramisu and red wine. A great experience. Wine quality was really good. The tiramisu was the best I have ever tasted. The pasta and the salad both were very filling.

******************************************************
                         THE BIG APPLE BRUNCH
      ******************************************************

Serafina the acclaimed curator of fine quality pizzas and pasta offers the good people of the city a Sunday Brunch which is in a league of its own . The Big Apple Brunch as they say it , is an opportunity for the people to explore the different aspects of their menu starting from appetizer to desserts . With the inclusion of a complementary glass of wine it is their message to us to go there , lay back and have a wonderful time with your dear ones amidst some fine quality food that they will serve you on the table . 

Before going through some of the items I have tasted let.me start by telling you that i didn't plan to write this review . I went there for a whole lot of conversation and that's the reason why I could not sample taste all.the items that were in offer . The items that i ate and will review are handpicked by me amongst the others that were available in the brunch menu. And once again I apologise for the fact that I didn't take a pic of the Brunch menu , something I could have done easily . But I didn't so i will put this forward as a good thing for the readers by letting this be a surprise and letting them be anxious about what exactly will Serafina be offering . Following are the items i did taste and i have penned down a few words and ratings for each of them in order for you to have a clear idea as to whether you should go for the Brunch or not .

¬∞ COMPLEMENTARY DRINK  ( 5 / 5 ) :- They will be asking you to select a glass of either red or white wine . I went for a chilled , bubbly glass of white wine . The wine that was served was of the finest quality . I am not a wine expert but once I smelled the wine, I immediately got attracted to it . And after my first sip, it was the smoothness of the liquid that won me over . Use the wine as your refresher while going through the appetizers .

¬∞ APPETIZERS :- 

1. Cream of chicken soup ( 4 / 5 ) :- Impressive is the word that comes to my mind . The soup was creamy and you will.simply love the texture . The flavors are rich and reminiscent clearly of how the butter was sauted with onion and garlic before adding the chicken stock . I simply could not stop sipping while admiring it at the same time . A really good soup to begin your meal .

2. Crispy fried calamari with marinara sauce ( 2.5 / 5 ) :- Surprisingly , a really bad squid starter dish . Mostly because there were flaws in the preparation and execution . Squid needs to be deep fried or properly fried to avoid the smell. On this particular dish it wasn't .Moreover  it was not served fresh from the pan , rather my guess it was done at least 30 minutes earlier. Luckily the marinara sauce rendered it consumable . The sauce was mostly done with a base of squashed tomatoes and added herbs . It was really good and the squids were somewhat eatable after dipping in them . But I personally like squids to be crunchy and not chewy . So, it was not a good dish to me and I don't recommend it .

3. Arrabiata spiced chicken ( 5 / 5 ) :- And after a forgettable squid dish we were served the finest chicken starter that I had for a long time . Arrabiata is something you associate with pasta . So this was a surprise for me . But I was simply bowled over by the taste and texture . The chicken.pieces were similar to nuggets , deep fried and then covered in some dry spices .The dry spices seem to include pepper , oregano and herbs . It was an amazing combination and we absolutely loved it . The best chicken starter I have had for a while .

Apart from these , there were Crostinis and Bruschettas which usually go lovely with a soup . I didn't try them due to lack of time but i advise to try them too .

¬∞ SALADS  ( 5 / 5 ) :- Here in the Big Apple Brunch , you will be requested to go to the salad counter where you will be tempted to select amidst a whole lot of salad ingredients . You will select and instruct a chef who will then whip the ingredients and create a special salad customized by you and suited to your taste .I love veggies so i selected almost all of them . The ingredients include :- 

Fresh lettuce , iceberg lettuce , broccoli , mushrooms , spring onions , bell peppers , fresh corns , zucchini , grilled chicken slices , sausage pieces  and boiled eggs . To stir the salad there are almost 3 types of sauces namely pesto and mayonese . 

I choose all the ingredients from above and added pesto sauce to whip the salad up . Topped it off with some boiled egg and it was super yummy . The secret to pull off a good salad lies on the freshness of the ingredients . The salad here simply won us over and i really wonder if i would get to have a better salad anywhere else . A highly recommended thing to try from my side .

¬∞ BREAKFAST SECTION ( 4 / 5 )  :-  Once again there is a separate counter where you will get the finest assortment of in house breads which you can pick up and have . There is also a counter where OMELETES are made . Just like the salad this is also a customized omelete counter where you choose the ingredients and a chef cooks it up for you. I was craving for a masala omelete so once again I choose almost all the ingredients . And they were onions , coriender , mushroom , tomatoes , green pepper and last but seriously not the least cheese . And the masala cheese omelette was just perfect for my plate . Once again I will encourage you to try it .

-----------------------

¬∞ MAIN COURSE :- 

1. Mini sliders ( 4 / 5 ) :-  And these were really amazing . Mini burgers , pretty small in size but big in taste . Made with good quality buns and a super tasty chicken patty. The burger also had some fresh lettuce and tomato . And served with freshly fried french fries . A burgers soul is in the patty and in this case it was perfect . We absolutely loved it and we are sure you will as well . Highly recommended .

2. Grilled chicken ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Okay so this is not the best I have had but still it was a good dish . There is a breast of chicken sliced in about 4 pieces grilled properly and served on a bed of mashed potatoes with some mushroom sauce sprayed over it . The chicken was tender and the only overpowering element in the dish was the sauce for which I feel the dish lost its potential . The chicken had a smoky flavor which I really liked and I would suggest you to try it as well .

Along with these 2 there was also a risotto which unfortunately I could not try because of the time . But once again I will encourage you to try those as well .

¬∞ PASTA ( 4.5 / 5 )  :-  Now comes the part where their expertise was tested and how well did they perform . Once again you will be asked to choose the type of pasta and here we choose penne . Then you will be asked to choose from a selection of sauces namely white , pesto , red and mixed . I decided to go for mixed sauce with a combination of red and white sauce . For the veggies I selected bell peppers, zucchini  and others which I cannot recall now but you can from the list of items in the brunch menu . We also choose chicken and prawns . The pasta was simply excellent to be precise . Once again the main ingredient which is the sauce was spot on . Rich and cream , it was just the kind of flavorful sauce I would like with my pasta . A must try .

¬∞ PIZZA  ( 5 / 5 ) :-   It was 3:15 pm and only 45 minutes left on the clock for their kitchen to stop serving brunch items . So we were quite late but not late enough to order a pizza which we left to relish at the end . We went for a white sauce pizza with a cheesy topping and veggies and chicken . They took a lot of time to serve the pizza and finally when they did , we were mesmerized . It was the best pizza i have ever had and that is my humble opinion . Thinnest crust pizza with liquid cheese sizzling on top of a white sauce base . It was heaven for any pizza lover . I savoured every slice of the pizza and if it was not for the time , I would have ordered more . If you are not having a pizza from.Serafina then you are certainly missing out on something . They are proper craftsmen when it comes to pizza and pasta and their food reflects their mastery .

--------------------------

¬∞ DESSERTS :- It's feels so delightful when you have tiramisu , pannacota on menu. But to me the dessert section lacked sensation . It's not that they were up to the mark but i was expecting better . The main reason for this I feel is they way they are done . For brunching people the dessert are made in batches and kept . So obviously they are made in multiples and that's where the quality gets lost .

¬∞ Panacotta ( 3 / 5 ) :- Sweetened cream but not on the tender side . Loved the texture though and the sweetness but could have been made better .

¬∞ Lemongrass cream brulee ( 3 / 5 ) :- Good dessert but it's sweeter than expected . This amount of sweetness is not expected in a custard like dessert . Loved the burnt cream on top and my expectation is you won't be dissapointed that much .

¬∞ Tiramisu ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Okay I had very very high expectations especially from.the bloggers who had such high praises . But i was not that much impressed . Because of the texture of the dessert . It was way too frothy and soft to be a cheesecake . I was expecting a bit harder where I can bite the cake , here it was more like tasting the cream with coffee powder in it . But it is not expected to be this way . The cream was way too frothy for my liking . But still if you are not that crazy about tiramisu this is not bad for you . Just requesting them to make the desert more firm , maybe smaller but more richer . 

-------------------------

¬∞ VERDICT :- This is the kind of brunch you need to overload you Sunday with . Good quality food , amazing ambience and fine service . I have some points to reflect as to why you should have a go for the Sunday brunch at Serafina :- 

1. That laid back feeling over a glass of wine .
2. What a salad .
3. Finest pasta .
4. Even finer pizza .
5 . More than decent enough food .
 
One tip is to go early and enjoy each and every item . The brunch is from 11 am to 4 pm so make sure you reach early and savour everything they have to offer .

Hands down best Italian restaurant in Kolkata. Me and my wife are die hard fans of Italian cuisine. Ever since we moved to Kolkata, we were on a lookout for a good italian joint. With Serafina, our watch has ended (lol). 

The ravioli here was the best I ever had and they serve the best Tiramisu in Kolkata. Thin crusts pizzas are delectable. Overall, a fine place to enjoy an outing with friends and family.

A Sunday just went by. And another is yet to come. I have an awesome plan for all of you guys so that you can enjoy the Sunday affair at its best!. So, hello guys, welcome to The Food Art and Science ‚Äì the food blog by The Orange Epistles! Today I am going to take you through my experience of the Big Apple Sunday Brunch at Serafina, Kolkata. Serafina, New York‚Äôs famous Italian eatery, made Kolkatans quite lucky because Kolkata is one of the numerable eight cities which has a Serafina outlet. Quest Mall, Ballyugunge houses this Serafina outlet at the fifth floor of the mall.

Love this Italian restaurant. It's fine dining so the ambience is amazing. The food is also good. I love their mushroom risotto and their pasta. The pizza is too sweet. 

The Sunday brunch isn't that amazing.

There are two kinds of people: those who think that Sunday is the end of the week, and others who think it is the start. But both the clubs agree that Sundays are meant for waking up late and enjoying heavy lunches after a late, heavy breakfast. The routine is more or less the same in every household I know of: wake up at 9 am, gorge on a breakfast of luchi,¬†alur dom and jilipi at 11.30, start cooking Mangsher Jhol at 12, enjoy lunch at 2.30, and then enjoy a siesta. That‚Äôs how we get over the week‚Äôs exhaustion¬†and prepare ourselves to face our Monday blues. We need some rejuvenation to do on Sundays. And, if you‚Äôre not up for all the Sunday morning cooking, then opt for the Sunday Brunch at Serafina Kolkata, and enjoy a delightful Italian meal that you won‚Äôt forget in a long time.

Sundays are mostly filled with fun-filled activities, quality time with family and friends and yes, definitely delving deep into some gastronomical wonderland! For me, Sundays are incomplete if I am not spending it with some great food, a movie maybe and some quality time with my family. And yes, for a Bengali in general Sundays are bound to be filled in with loads of ‚Äòlyad‚Äô! Wondering what the heck is that? I am so sorry to know that, but anyway, I will let you know. ‚ÄòLyad‚Äô is a crucial part of Bengali life (and I am no exception), without it Bengalis might even lose their identity! It‚Äôs the beautiful art of fighting a world war in your head while actually doing nothing! It‚Äôs an amazing time independent process to relax your body and mind! Interesting, isn‚Äôt it? :) And a laid back, soul satisfying Sunday Brunch (with some wine, maybe!) is the fuel that a relaxed brain needs while fighting that hyperlapsed World War! Making any sense? Not much? Forget it, let‚Äôs concentrate on the fuel, I mean the Brunch I was talking about! :) Lately I tried out the Big Apple Sunday Brunch at Serafina (Kolkata) and yes, you guessed it right, I was left spellbound. It was the best collection of food and beverages I have tried at one shot in a really long time. Trust me, I will rate this brunch nothing less than 10 out of 10. Yes you read it right, it scores full marks in my books and yes, if you have been reading my blog posts or reviews, you must be knowing that I have never ever given full marks to any restaurant whether it be in Kolkata, Delhi or abroad (at least not in last 3 years or so)! Hence, that surely speaks volume about Serafina in general, and this Sunday brunch I am going to discuss today.

I went for the Big Apple Brunch (non-veg). It's the kind of brunch where you order food from a menu and the servers serve it on your table.

AMBIANCE/DECOR - a small place with a lovely decor. It gets crowded pretty quickly on a Sunday so make sure to get your reservations done!

STAFF/SERVICE: Courteous staff but delayed/slow service for the brunch.¬†

FOOD:¬†

Complementary drink - we ordered a Virgin Mojito and Red wine. The Mojito was good and refreshing.

Pancakes with honey were amazing.

Appetizers -
Bruschetta - good.¬†
Veg Crostini - amazing. Loved it.
Calamari basket - crispy and yum.
Spicy Chicken - very well spiced and so juicy.
Overall, the appetizers were pretty good!

Mains-
Risotto, spaghetti and the chicken breast was average. The mains require a bit of improvement.
I loved the mini slider. The French fries were so crispy and yummy!

Desserts-
Tiramisu - a specialty here and yes, it is heavenly!!
The panna cotta and creme brulee were good.
The pudding was average.

Live Counters-
I made my own pizza. I asked for a whole wheat base but they didn't have it so I went for the regular one instead. The quantity was great. They offered a huge pizza but my only complaint was that they did not put a good quantity of meat on top of the pizza. I went for chicken and prawn topping and there were like 3-5 strands of thinly sliced chicken and hardly 1 or 2 prawns in it.¬†
My fiance went for Make your Own Salad ¬†and Eggs made your way. He loved his first serving of omelet. The second serving was a little bit too salty.

Overall, amazing appetizers and desserts. They just need to work on the mains a little for the brunch. Also, very less options for meat lovers like my fiance. He was a little disappointed. The plus points are that they don't compromise on the quantity and the quality was pretty good.

Best Tiramisu of Calcutta üòä

Have been there couple of times, pretty good service and food.. Once, while asking for  food suggestions the server told me "our Tiramisu is best in Calcutta". I agree with him completely üòä

I can't stay away from good Italian food for too long. So when it came to picking a nice place for a solo lunch, Serafina it was. The place has both outdoor seating and nice wooden interiors - I chose the latter because I like a quiet corner to myself. I ordered a black truffle risotto and a glass of Two Oceans Pinotage. Complimentary bread soon followed - yay! On request, the server very kindly prepared a dip out of the olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table, and it went beautifully with the warm bread. My risotto arrived soon after - have to commend the swift service. It was served on a flat plate, for which I will have to insert a note of reserve - a risotto, I feel, is better enjoyed in a deep dish. It tasted really good, and was just the right amount for a not-top-heavy lunch - however, I would say that they could have given more of the truffles, which are what make the dish. A touch more flavour would be good as well, as I had to add lots of chilli flakes, but then I like everything really spicy so this could be a biased opinion. After that I had a single malt - they didn't have the Laprohaig 10 YO, which I wanted to try, but the Singleton of Glen was a great substitute. I would say that the best feature of this restaurant is the service - there was always a server within earshot and I was made to feel welcome throughout. The drinks list is extensive too. I do have some reservations about the food, but there's no denying that it's good quality stuff with top notch ingredients. 
Overall, a good experience! :)

Quality- up to the mark !

Serafina had been on my wishlist for long since its inception in the city. Serafina is always considered as the best Italian fine dining restaurant in Kolkata. The launch of Sunday brunch over here has made this place much popular than it used to be. I was planning to visit Serafina on a Sunday and try out the much hyped brunch when I received an invitation from First Idea PR to visit Serafina on the occassion of Sunday Brunch. Naturally, my excitement got doubled !

It was a Sunday afternoon and Serafina was bustling with people. I was able to realise the craze which people already have for their Sunday brunch. Luckily, a table was reserved for the bloggers meet. As we got seated, the items of the brunch started coming one by one. To be honest, it's quite difficult for one person to savour the entire brunch.

Before going to my experience, let me give some details on the inclusions of the brunch.

‚Ä¢ A complementary glass of wine/beer/sangria or mocktail.

‚Ä¢ An assorted bread basket where the breads are prepared in-house.

‚Ä¢ Soup of the day.
Must try - Cream of Chicken Soup.

‚Ä¢ Bruschetta and Veg Crostini.

‚Ä¢ Crispy Fried Calamari with Marinara Sauce

‚Ä¢ Arrabiata Spiced Chicken

‚Ä¢ Salad.
Make your own salad at the salad counter.

‚Ä¢ Omlet.
Choose your ingredients at the omlet counter and your omlet would be ready !

‚Ä¢ Chicken Sliders with French Fries.

‚Ä¢ Grilled Chicken with Veggies and Potato Mash.

‚Ä¢ Thin Crust Pizza.
Must try - White base pizza with calamari, shrimps and bacon.

‚Ä¢ Pasta.
Must try - Spaghetti in White Sauce with chicken, shrimps and bacon.

‚Ä¢ Tiramisu.

I'm sure you're surprised to know so many things served at the brunch but at the same time, you must wondering this to be pretty costly ! To prove you wrong, let me tell you that the brunch consisting of so much is priced at just 999 plus taxes per person, which makes it the most economical brunch in the city ! Except the drink, everything else on the menu is UNLIMITED.

Coming to my experience, the first thing that reached the table was a glass of wine followed by a bread basket. The cream of chicken soup, which came next, was subtle and flavourful. I specially loved the bruschetta that came with the soup for the juicy tomatoes. Among appetizers, the fried calamari is to die for. They were just perfect ! The chicken was good too. The omlet was thick and well done. The salad tasted amazing. The chicken sliders were too good. The juicy chicken fillet coated with caramelized onions tasted excellent.

I was almost full with the appetizers, but the delicious offerings in the main course helped me create some space in my stomach. The grilled chicken was perfectly done. A special mention goes to the smooth potato mash. Among thin crust pizzas, I had the Red base pizza with chicken and White base pizza with calamari, shrimps and bacon. The red base pizza was good but the white base pizza was the show stopper ! It was so damn delicious that all of us fell in love with it. Next were the pastas, from which we had Penne in Arrabiata sauce and Spaghetti in white sauce white shrimps, bacon and chicken. The penne was good but what turned out to be excellent was the spaghetti. The texture of the spaghetti was just perfect and the white sauce tasted brilliant.

For desserts, we had Tiramisu, Panacotta and Lemongrass Creme Brulee. Serafina is famous for their Tiramisu and I was lost in its flavour. The richness of coffee could be felt. The Panacotta and Creme Brulee were also loved by all of us !

Overall, everything on the brunch tasted out of the world. The brunch menu is wisely chosen and you get much more than what you pay for ! The quantity and quality of food is of top notch. The service and hospitality are commendable as well. I would just end with this note that if you haven't tried the brunch at Serafina, you're definitely missing a lot. So, plan your next Sunday at Serafina and try out the brunch !

Definitely good, somewhat great but not really worth the money. Starters were comparatively better than the main course. Try not choosing any of the chicken items, if you can go for sea food or other meat.

Three dishes were ordered , a starter of Prawn , a signature  pizza and a cheesy lemony pasta with shrimps. It was simply awesomeness. Polite staff and a chic decor. Just a little downer ... 5 medium size prawn starter costed 900/- . 
But rest of it was worth it. Please do stop by.

I visited this place long back so don't remember much. We had only tried two salads, I really liked it. The service was a little slow, they also were not very organized, because they misinformed us about certain items on the menu. I felt it was a little overrated and will definitely leave a hole in your pocket.

We visited this place on Sunday night (9-Apr-17). We had dinner and spent close to one and a half hours at the place. It's quite a small, packed restaurant for its price range. 
We tried penne mixed sauce pasta, grilled chicken and spinach ravioli. Food was simply delicious and service was quite good as well. Would go there again definitely for their amazing food. 
We ended our meal with a chocolate mousse which was heavenly and we loved the presentation too!

Serafina is located inside¬†Quest Mall, Kolkata on the top floor where Smoke House Delhi, Irish House and Bombay Brasserie are situated. I along with group of other bloggers were invited here by Atreya Paul to come and try out their Sunday Brunch. It is priced at 999 plus taxes and happens only on Sunday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. One can take a complimentary glass of Wine/Breezer/Beer/Sangria/Mocktail/Aerated Beverage from the menu.

Serafina, New York's famous Italian joint, is a place to fall in love with. Yes yes, it is here, in Kolkata, at quest mall and promises to be one of the best Italian dining experiences for you!
They have now introduced a very interesting brunch menu charged at 999+ taxes every Sunday to take your brunching experience to a whole new level. 
Recently, attended a bloggers meet and tried their brunch menu and trust me for the price, the experience is totally worth it!

The brunch begins with an assortment bread basket closed of buns, sticks, bread and butter.
Next up, the extremely delicious, Italian staple- bruschetta of tomatoes, garlic and basil on a toasted bread.
The crostinis taste divine with the medly of cheese, garlic, peppers and is a perfect start to your brunch.
Ask your server to pour a glass of sparkly (champagne) or wine as yu please.
Team it up with a make your own salad. I tried exotic veggies with pesto and olive oil.
One of the best soups I have had recently was here. The ginger carrot soup was aromatic, thin, delicious and worth licking the bowl off!
Next up was delicious pizza with tomato sauce base, cheese and peppers. 
Pizzas are thin, and honestly one of the best pizzas recently. Thin, with no sauce over bearing the taste, delicious cheese not oozing but seems to be part of the bread. That is the art of Italian pizza making!
The fettuccine in tomato and creme sauce is so divine that I am salivating just by wiring about it. 
Tomato risotto shows what serafina is capable off! Completely scoring with their expertise, they nailed the complicated dish with so much perfection. The chewy arborio, vegetables, tomato sauce and a hint of butter and cheese was just the best risotto ever.

End your meal with the famous serafina Tiramisu which Is just wow! Creme brulee also makes you drool. 

All this, at just 999 plus taxes is a steal. 
Overall had a wonderful brunching session and hope to be back soon.

Whenever you think tiramisu think Serafina. Thus place undoubtedly serves the best tiramisu in Kolkata.
Serafina has introduced "The Big Apple Brunch" for Sundays(11am-4pm).
Priced at 999( plus taxes) this is something one must not miss.
There is a wide array of breads presented at your table then you can choose either carrot &ginger soup or cream of chicken soup.
Among the appetizers there are
Bruchetta, veg Crostini(vegetarian)
Calamari with marinara sauce, arrabiata spiced chicken( non-veg)
I loved the freshness of the bruchetta and the spiced chicken but the marinara sauce was a bit bland.
The next is the salad which you can prepare on yr own and can choose from the leaves,dressings, veggies and meat. I made the salad with bacon, sliced chicken, egg, lemon and mint dressing and iceberg lettuce. For me it was the perfect salad.
Likewise for pasta also you can exercise your discretion.
Among the mains I totally loved the spaghetti squash and the mini sliders which was grilled chicken breast served with caramelized onion and French fries.
The pizzas were perfect thin crust ones.
Now the best part of the brunch are the desserts.
The tiramisu was divine and so was lemon grass cr√®me brulee.
A glass of wine goes with the brunch.
The brunch for me was a total value for money.

Serafina, the well known New York brand specialising in Italian cuisine opened doors in Kolkata, Quest Mall. They have an outdoor seating arrangements which tends to get stuffy because if the heat coming from the terrace! Their trademark yellow scooty, parked outside provides the perfect picture taking area! The chairs are comfortable. Their wood oven us fascinating to watch as the flames go from low to high and high to low! The brunch is on from 11 until 4 on Sundays! Priced at 999 plus taxes, it is the best deal possible! The serve white wines - Chardan and Sula. Making it a perfect couple, pizza and wine! We started with their "make your own salads." Followed with some sausage omelette. The pizza, pasta, bruschettas were all served on the table! The desserrs are to die for! Start with their " tiramisu" if you are still alive move on to their creme brulee and bread pudding!

The ambience is amazing. Especially if you want to take someone special :p. I would recommend all their pizzas especially with ham or Bacon topping. 
At the end its almost a ritual to top it off with their tiramisu. 1 can serve 4 . Although its pricey its totally worth it. Waiters are also very helpful.
Actual cost : 2 people about 2000 4 people 3800
And as the number of people increase average cost decreases. Pizza can serve 3.

Their beautiful decor, lip-smacking thin-crust pizzas and heavenly Tiramisus are what Serafina wins us over with every time! One of the most popular pizzas here is the Margherita V.I.P., it‚Äôs perfectly crunchy and cheesy.
Apart from the food, this place is sure to win not only your heart but also your mind and taste buds with it's top notch decor and elegance.
Sneaky peak - Reserve to get a 6 course lunch for Rs 699+tax.

Later we order one Petto Di Pollo grigliato and one  spaghetti funghi as a main course. The pepe nero was good but the spaghetti was not that good. The price is on higher side.

We walked out of Inox at Quest mall and we were particularly in a good mood after watching la la land. This had to be followed by a good meal. I dug out the deal apps and got to work. Found one for a three course meal at Serafina. Why not! 
The decor is very quaint and not over the top. Just the right lighting for the food, the right music at the right volume. This set the mood right. My husband had the non-veg combo and me, the veg one. Let me describe my palate experience first. The caprese salad was beautiful. I mean it looked good and tasted even better. The risotto was very well done too. The veges that needed the crunch had them and that which required softness had that likewise. The bites were just perfect. And the cherry on the cake, no pun intended, was the ricotta chocolate cake. Nothing short of the decadence to end the perfect meal. My husband had an equally satiating experience. His house chicken salad and spaghetti in pesto were perfect according to him. He had the same sweet nirvana as me. 
The service was exemplary. The fact that we were with a coupon didn't invite a drop in quality. The politeness, and the swiftness were pleasant to experience. The fact that my plate was cleared within 10 seconds of closing it, well some five stars miss this service etiquette by a huge mark. 

Overall, this is one good Italian restaurant and it should make up for the prices with the food and service. Will be back soon.

This is one of the high end restaurants of Kolkata. Located on the top floor of Quest, it has a soothing decor which is quite elegant. The staff is courteous and service is good.
We ordered a Lychee and Ginger Mojito and Cucumber Cooler which was refreshing. The pesto pasta tasted heavenly but the Margarita VIP disappointed us a bit. The Pana Cota was absolutely amazing. It contained too much tomato sauce for our taste.
The prices are exorbitant, though.

My experience at Serafina has been good in the past two visits but after a couple of disappointing visits earlier. 

The place is definitely over priced which is one of its biggest negative. 

There are a lot of choices available in the pastas, pizzas and risotto but not all of them taste nice but at the same time there are some dishes that absolutely taste amazing. 

Hope they are more consistent with the food quality in the future!

Went there for s family dinner and was not disappointed. The food was just amazing specially the chicken in pesto and cream and the baked bhetki though, the calamari and the ¬†bruschetta could have been better but was still very tasty. The main course chicken dishes were really nice too. But the highlight was the dessert for me which was the tiramisu and it was like a little bit of heaven on a plate! We were 5 people and the bill came to around 6000 bucks so, it is a bit expensive. But, if you're looking for an authentic Italian meal and want to go out for a nice lunch or dinner with family or want to impress someone on a date then this is the place to go.
            
P.s they have candles on each table to make your experience a little bit more wonderful.

Went to Serafina on a new year's eve dinner. Missed out on the morning brunch. The ambience is good enough at best. The staff is quite friendly and courteous. This is a place for authentic Italian recipes, maybe even one of the best in kolkata. Being our first time trying authentic Italian food, we were quite confused to make an order as all the dishes were in Italian. The staff helped us out in chosing the appropriate items. Now the quantity of food for me is not much considering the price of the items. But the quality is top notch which may make up for it. All in all it is a good place, it would have got a higher score if the quantity was more.

Dimly lit interiors, well stocked bar, spacious seating arrangements and courteous stuff - ticks off every thing for a fine dining doesn't it? Sounds clich√©? Well it's not. It's one of the most exquisite places within budget to dine out at.The outdoor seating arrangements gives the illusion of dining at some European cafe.

Coming to food we opted for the set meal which is available from Monday to Friday @ 699+ taxes (veg) and @ 799+ taxes( non veg).A 6 course platter priced generously with a complimentary glass of wine/Mocktail/sangria according to your choice. Starting with the soups we ordered Chicken grana padano and Chicken mushroom cappuccino with an assortment of breads. The soups were mildly flavored just as the perfect beginning of a meal should be. The bread basket contained 3 different types of freshly baked fluffy bread amazing to have along with the soups. From the salad section Chicken ceaser salad and Insalat marinara it was of which the latter tasted better. I have never been a fan of salads and neither do I opt for ordering any while dining ,( I'm a hardcore carnivore so anything with veggies doesn't apeal m much) and was more interested in skipping this section but my ever so veg loving partner insisted on having some. The second salads with seafoods was quite different. One spoonful and I did not require any coaxing to have it. My partner was all smiles by the time I cleaned the plate. Next were starters which turned out to be quite disappointing. Herbed grilled chicken was a wee bit chewy and lacked marination. BBQ pork sausage on the other hand tasted nice. Served in a kebab style with pineapples it was a dish I looked forward to devouring. But the quantity of pork was miserably low which I felt was a big letdown. Well the complimentary glass of red wine made up for everything actually. Silky smooth texture of the wine along with the starters - a divine experience altogether. Its a pity that even if I wanted to have more wine I couldn't because there were still 3 courses to be finished( most importantly there was a pizza coming which I wouldn't miss even for my life).The main course consisted of Pollo arrabiata and Pollo Parmigiano of which it's really hard to choose because both tasted okayish. Arrabiata consisted of two strips of chicken toasted beautifully and Parmigiano came with Baked chicken with mashed potato and other veggies on the side. Then comes the pizza. the most anticipated section of the meal. Pizza salsiccia and Four cheese pasta it was. The pizza contained 8 slices topped with generous amount of barbecued Chicken sausage. Sprinkle the oregano to make it even more tasty. It was of thin crust exactly as I like it. Not ultra thin so that it can break with the load of the topping but maintaining the perfect balance of taste and hardness. The pasta again tasted fabulous. A must try dish. As the name goes it was a very cheesy affair which chunks of chicken cooked to perfection. For desserts we had Lemongrass cream brulee( another must try) and chocolate mousse. Although being a chocoholic i will prefer the lemongrass cream brulee anyday over the chocolate mousse which was a bit bitterish in taste. Sadly the famous Tiramisu was not included in the set meal and i had to give it a miss.

¬†Bill came to be as low as around 2k which was a surprise. The service is a bit slow as most of the dishes require a lot of time to be prepared. But you will hardly realize how time will fly here once you are here. Will definitely go back for Sunday brunch sometime :)

The brunch was on my checklist for a while. And gladly so, because for the spread, ambience and service, it made for a perfect Sunday date. 

I like the fact that you can choose every bit of your salad, pasta and pizza from the menu because I hate the usual marinara sauce. The pesto and cream sauce made my day! I am a sucker for spaghetti squash, and the main course with squash and pine nuts did perfect justice to my craving. The fried calamari was really good too. But the winner of the entire brunch menu is the pannacotta-brilliant as an adjective does not do justice to it. Even after stuffing myself to the brim, I had two of these (yeah, greedy). The tiramisu has a strong coffee flavor, which I really liked. If one asks me about Italian cuisine in Kolkata, Serafina is going to be my first suggestion from now on.

My partner is very fond of Italian cuisine and when we were to celebrate our five years of togetherness we decided to opt for Serafina. Heard many praises about the big apple brunch, so we gave it a chance and our Sunday afternoon luncheon started with an exquisite scrambled egg with beacon. They have a separte egg counter and a salad counter included in their six course brunch menu where you can make your own salad and choose your own kinda egg! After preparing a yummy salad which my partner finished very enthusiastically (and he hates vegetables hence you can guess the salad was that much good) we ordered a chicken creme soup which was very bland but again we were made happy with fried calamari and chicken poppers. Calamaris were tangy and crispy. In the main course we had mini siders of chicken which I loved very much and one chicken breast recipe which was good too. Then we ordered pasta in white sauce with prawn and beacon and it was exquisite. The flat bread pizza on the other hand was not very special. As we were almost full we went on to the desert section and had their classic tiramisu and panacotta. Both of them were all right and we ended our course with bread and butter pudding which I liked a lot. The service was excellent and all the staffs were very cordial. Total affair was a bit costly and time taking as they were serving us preparing each dish then and then on request(though its a buffet spread nothing is made beforehand. I loved this approach actually). Overall a memorable day spent with fine dining indeed.

A high end restaurant on the 5th floor of Quest Mall.
Ambience is awesome. Decided to sit outside & may be due to that found the service a bit slow.
The mocktails Lychee & Ginger Mojito, Shirley Temple & Cool Blue were all excellent. The starters, I forget their names were fish balls, Arrabiata spiced small cubes of chicken with a dip & Perma ham wrapped chicken stuffed with mozzarella cheese & vodka sauce. Unfortunately ham was not available & found the chicken a bit too dry.
The main course was a chicken pizza, Con Pollo E Scarmozaa which was thin crust & tasted really good.
The Canneloni Di Pollo E Funghi was heavenly & a sea food risotto i.e. Risotto Frutti Di Pasce was not bad either.
The desserts Tiramisu was very good but Focaccia Alla Nutella was pure heaven. It was worth the wait.

Amazing place for a nice Sunday Brunch. 

The cream sauce of the pasta had a amazing flavour which lingers in your mouth for long.


The Pannacota was super with the right balance of flavour and sweetness.

Visited for our wedding anniversary, but it was an average experience. The service and food are OK but not upto the mark. The menu is  difficult for  guests to understand and neither the waiter can give a clear picture about th dish. Ambience is so dull. In fact Aftr knowing we r thr to celebrate our anniversary they didnt  even hv Courtesy to wish. Overall an average experience. But on the brighter side the only beam of hope is their Tiramisu and which is to die for..

New Italian favourite !!!
We went for a quick dinner on Sunday night. Ordered from the Chef's special menu. And OMG it was super special indeed !!! We ordered the Spaghetti with chicken in pesto sauce (I cannot spell out its name as per the menu) and Chicken Rollatini. Both were bang-on in terms of flavour. And the best part was its just enough to fill you up physically and keep wanting more mentally. That's the kind of food you want, trust meüòâ
I'm going back for dessert soon !!! üòã

I had opted for the Apple brunch. Since I was accompanied by a friend who is not a foodie, I missed out on the salad and pizza but the rest of the brunch was worth all the money. The chicken in cream soup, fried calamari and the tiramisu is to die for. Loved the ambience and the service... I only wish the panacotta and the tiramisu was of larger portions (especially tiramisu coz' it really tasted like heaven) üòç

Serafina, located on the 5th floor of Quest mall, has always been one of my favourite places to go celebrate special occasions (I've been going on my birthday for the last few years!). For someone who lives authentic Italian, it's a dream come true. We opted for the 6course set meal which is served Monday-Thursday 12 noon-3pm. It's 699 for veg and 799 for non veg plus taxes. For two people with tax, it amounted to around 2200 - a little on the steep side but worth it as we got to try 12 different dishes. The six courses are soup, salad, starter, main, pizza/pasta and dessert along with a drink. There are a few veg and non veg options to pick from for each course. We went for:
Soup - chicken mushroom soup (creamy, thick, hearty soup)
Clear chicken Parmesan soup (a little bland and unappetising)

Salad - classic chicken Caesar salad 
Seafood salad (mixing basa fish, squid and other seafood). Both the salads were refreshing but nothing  to rave about 

Starter- chicken served on skewers with a dipping sauce (chicken was slightly over cooked but the dipping sauce accompanying it was fabulous)
Crispy mushroom with cheese (one of my highlights of the day. Crispy mushroom pockets are every vegetarians dream!)

Main - chicken arabiatta with polenta (creamy polenta with juicy chicken and rich herbaceous tomato sauce - divine)
Pollo parmigiana (chicken with cheese served with rocket leaves - chicken was wel cooked and garnishing was fresh)

Pasta - penne ala vodka (yummm! Vodka pasta at its best!)
Pizza - thin crust pizza with chicken sausage (serafina is known for its pizza so you should definitely try a pizza out! They serve a full 8 slice pizza even as part of the set meal so it's well worth your money!)

Dessert - creamy light chocolate mousse 
Rich decadent chocolate brownie

Enjoyed my meal, particularly the latter half. I genuinely felt it was worth the cost as they did not hold back on either quality or quantity. Make your week day special by visiting this place!

Went to this place earlier this year. The ambience is very good. Behaviour of the staffs are very friendly. Coming to the food, we ordered Mini Slider - it was having two small burgers with salads and Rigatoni Alla Bolognese - that is a lamb pasta. Both were delicious in taste. For dessert we ordered Tiramisu - suggested by the staff and it tasted heavenly. Altogether it was an amazing experience.

Headed to Serafina for a well planned Sunday Brunch with friends, and my my it was totally worth every penny i spent there.¬†
Firstly, the menu was expansive and it gave us all that we wanted. Salad, Soup, Drink, Main course n desserts. The best part being it was fully table service. We just had to order and eat like a king.¬†
Coning to the food, Serafina did not disappoint us in any way. The food quality was as per its standard and we loved every part of it. Dishes worth special mention were Pesto Spaghetti Pasta, Sangria, Arrabiata Spiced Chicken and the ever famous Tiramisu. We all went gaga over tiramisu. Thank you Serafina for making our Sunday a memorable one.¬†
Would definitely recommend the Brunch for those who need a wholesome Serafina Experience.

Had visited the place again on 21st October. It was my daughter's birthday. We had ordered mushroom arabiatta,  garlic bread focaccia and bruschettas. The garlic bread and bruschettas were just average or in fact below average of what expected from Serafina. The mushroom arabiatta was just awesome. In drinks we ordered orange mojito which was ok. And in main course we ordered :-
Pizza margherita VIP - which was ok 
Pizza pesto - good
Spinach and cheese ravioli - just ok
Spaghetti aglio olio - not at all good

They had also presented us with a complementary cake for which I am thankful to them as it made my daughter's evening special. But the taste of the cake was not at all good with full of added colour and cream.

Went to this place on sunday evening,most of the seats indoor were reserved..we asked for a table indoors and was given a center table.the spacing between tables is so less that on the next 4 seater there was a family and they are almost on us creating lot of disturbance.the staff didn't give much heed to it and finally we settled outside..though the ambience is really good..the gaps between tables need to be taken care of otherwise no use of such good ambience..coming to food it was not at all worth for money..we ordered customized veg mix sauce pasta it didn't tasted that nice ..when we ask for improving it they changed it to a white sauce pasta.Pasta was not at all worth for money though we wanted a portion of red sauce..we ordered a mocktail n arbritta grilled chicken both of which are ok..Overall :-
Ambience-3.5
Food-3

A luxury dining restaurant on the top floor of Quest mall. The calm and posh ambience is perfect for a romantic candle-light dinner. The seating arrangement, illumination and decor might make you feel that you are seating in an Italian restaurant. They serve authentic Italian cuisine and quite a few exotic wines from some reputed vineyard around the world. In antipasti, we had ordered :
#Serafina chicken salad
#Arrabiata spiced chicken - tiny cubes of chicken tossed in arrabiata spice, served with dip
These two were accompanied by some fine imported red wines like :
#Golden sparrow - Sangiovese, Italy
#Two ocean - Pinotage, South Africa
In mains, we had :
#Rigatoni alla bolognese - Classical spaghetti in lamb bolognese sauce, cooked to perfection
#Grilled chicken aglio olio - Chicken grilled in some tangy sauce, served with portion of spaghetti cooked in garlic oil
The overall experience was nice. However, I'd like to give you a word of caution: don't depend much on the waiters advice to order a dish because they will mostly insist you dishes which are ridiculously over priced only and not mentioned there in the menu list. Also, the pocket pinch is too much here. Any non-veg main dish is priced around INR 700 - 900 AI, on an average. A glass (150 ml) of imported red wine will cost you around INR 900 AI. However, considering the ambience and quality of food, you can keep this place in your bucket list, for special dinner dates.

Looking for good Italian food in kolkata - serafina is the place for you! Chef's special Grilled chicken breast and rigatoni alla bolognese lived upto our expectation of taste and value for money. The waiter serving us was very friendly and helped us through the menu with all the hard-to-pronounce dishes. He even suggested us dishes for our next visit.
The friendly gestures, ambiance and tasty Italian treat makes serafina, a place you would like to visit again. Thank you

I had to go for dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday and serafina struck my mind and I would say it was a perfect choice.
Located in quest mall it opened around 1 year ago, it was my first visit. It has both outdoor and indoor seating arrangement but prefer to sit at the inside to get an American feeling. Lights were dim inside and we had a candlelight dinner with some slow music.
We ordered their classic D chopra salad and di serafina pizza with goat cheese. I do have a craving for thick pan crust but their thin crust was brilliant, very soft. Their pizza is more than enough for 2 persons and we were through. We ordered their signature tiramisu which is a must when u go there.
It had the perfect bitterness, too soft and equally fluffy. We had such a grand dessert may be for the first time. We finished it in less than a minute. We were provided with a complimentary cake also made especially by the chef for us. 
Ambience here is good staff are very helpful courteous polite but they always suggest higher priced items which may be more tastier but also hit your pocket very hard. It's the only negative for vegetarians where certain items could be a bit expensive and exceed your budget. Food is really authentic flavours are rich and pure. 
My verdict would be fantabulous dinner. Totally worth it.

I cannot describe Serafina without the words SIMPLY OUTSTANDING. My recent visit with my cousin sister gave me an opportunity to refer to her the Tarto fonero pizza. And she loved it like no other pizza; along with a Tiramisu which I feel is the best I've ever tasted, our day was made.
Kudos to the Chefs and the management staff of Serafina for such a memorable experience.

This restaurant is located in the 5th floor of Quest Mall. This was the only restaurant in Quest Mall which I was yet to try out so this was the default choice.

You have option of seating outside and inside. We opted for inside just to have a feel of the ambiance which was pretty good. They have a bar. The wall has been decorated with wine bottles and some classy chandeliers decorating the ceilings.

The staffs are suggestive, in fact they were suggestive to all the orders which we tried to place, even we were pretty sure of the order..;) and I am not complaining :P

Now coming to the food,

Assorted Sea Food (We ordered calamari but were suggested that we should go for the assorted sea food dish instead). This was pretty good...pieces and rings of sea food along with dips.

In pizza we ordered Alla Norcina (Tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms and spicy sausages) - thin crust pizza, taste wise also good.

Overall a nice experience...

Lovely, sunny decor and great food topped with amazing service. 

6 of us went for dinner last night. Though it was the first night of the Durga Pujas, we managed to get a table without any reservation. Ordered bruschetta, fried calamari and potato wedges in arabiatta style for starters. The bruschetta was loaded with fresh tomatoes and was crunchy and wholesome. The fried calamari was also great and the potatoes were beautiful. Just the right crunchiness outside and soft and juicy inside. For mains we had a pork and bacon pizza, a chicken and mushroom pizza and a pasta in white sauce. The pizzas are to die for. Thin crust 12 inches, juicy with cheese and lots of toppings. The pork and bacon pizza  was heavenly. Finished off the dinner with what I think is the best tiramisu in Kolkata. Fluffy, soft with the right amount of sweetness. Had to do a repeat of the tiramisu.

The service is great and the food is superlative. 

A bit costly but what the hell, its worth it. 

Must visit again.

The salad was 4/5 , grilled fillet mignon is 4.5/5  bhetki steak 5/5 and tiramisu is 10/5. Tiramisu was the best tiramisu I ever had. Bhetki steak was amazing , it was soft and juicy. Meat was very well grilled. All the items were impressive.  Wish to visit the place again.

This is a good place if you want to go for a date but the food is really overpriced and not worth it.  Candlelight,  dim light,  good wine and Sangria which was freshly made and didn't taste that good couldn't really make up for it. So for starters we ordered Di Sofia,  their version of Caesar Salad which was good and the waiter recommended herb fried chicken with Arrabbiata sauce. Neither the fried chicken was good nor the sauce.  The sauce looked like chicken curry and the fried chicken didn't even looked tempting.  For main course we ordered Pepperoni Pizza with arugula. We were waiting for the pizza and it wasn't a good sight to see.we could count the pieces of mozzarella.  We love pepperoni pizza but so less cheese that it made the pizza less tempting.  We called the chef and he suggested us to use Parmesan   and sprinkle on the pizza because he can't put more mozzarella and then put it back in the oven,  the pizza will be soggy. 
The decor and the ambience of the restaurant is pretty good but I wish the food was better.

So I went here reading the 'its known for' in the Zomato App! The description clearly mentions candles on the table,  decent decor and so on. I enter the restro with the expectation of having nice lunch date with my guy who flew from Mumbai. I asked the person standing outside the restro if I may have candles on the table and good music, to my surprise he made a horrible face and said 'maim, saary we dont provide such faacilities'. And I was like why do write stuff which aint true about you guys?! We moved out  gladly to a better, much better restro with better services offcourse! Shame on you guys. Shame!

Beautifully done restaurant on the 5th floor of quest mall. If one is looking for great Italian cuisine. This is the place to be. I had a memorable and a grand experience here. Nice place for a romantic meal if one van afford the sky High prices. But all is worth it. 
Coming to the food:
1. Char grilled cottage cheese steak- one will not believe the paneer can be so good. A veg steak is my least preference when dining out but this try was worth it. 
2. Ravioli gogronzo paprika- great presentation.....cooked to perfection.
3. Rissoto porcini- out of the world....
4. Orange twist mojito- refreshing
5. Chicken pasta....forgetting the name. Was WOW. 
6. Tiramisu was really nice

Overall a great experience and Arush had suggested and served us well. Would definitely visit again.

If you want a quite romantic candle light dinner with great Italian Cuisine then this is the place for you. Located in Quest Mall this place serves the best Italian food in Kolkata in my opinion. The prices are on a higher side but it sure makes it up with the taste of the food.¬†

We went there on a weekday evening . The ambiance of the place was superb. We were Seated in a cozy corner with candle light flickering between us two.(Talk About Romantic Environment)

Coming to the food we ordered one place grilled chicken breast and on place of spaghetti carbonara. Both the items the best we ever had. The staff were also very polite.

Overall rating.... great place for a romantic evening and great Italian food. ..... :)

It was beautifully presented with a delicious and even flavouring throughout. My friend had a Serafina Chicken Salad which tasted amazing, it had a creamy consistency and well as a beautiful hint of mintiness to it. The french fries we ordered were in ample amount. The staff was very friendly and helping. The quantity of food was fulfilling and palatable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in mood for a sophisticated Italian restaurant.

Ambience is good and soothing... food was ok..service is also good. Good place to hangout with family and friends. Pasta tasted good..menu variety is sufficient. More mocktails should be added. Over all good experience.

Yumm! It was indeed a mouthwatering Italian cuisine. A 6-course meal at just 799 (+taxes) is just unbelievable. The ambience was good, waiters well behaved and the food was worth the money. We started with mushroom cappuccino soup (non-veg), then came chicken Caesar salad followed by herbed chicken, stuffed chicken breast (the name I don't remember), four-cheese pasta(for me) & chicken barbecue pizza(for my husband) and last but not the least, the dessert, bread cream pudding. To the meal was added complimentary drinks. Overall the lunch was splendid.

Visited this fine dinning restaurant for a couple of times. It's a perfect place to try out the Italian delicacies for Sunday brunch. The rates are bit on the higher side but it's worth it in terms of taste and quantity. The thin crusted sea food pizza topped with white cheesy sauce is the best one What I like about this place about customizing the pizza which comes with its best taste. Don't forget to dig in to the dessert Tiramisu - best in the city.

GOOD THINGS HAPPEN OVER FINE ITALIAN CUISINE.
AS A PART OF ZOMATO AND KOLKATA FOODIES GROUP I GOT A CHANCE TO VISIT THIS RESTAURANT. 
The restaurant is very conveniently located on the 5th floor of the quest mall,near beck bagan. The ambience is very classy and the decoration is a combination of modern art and old esthetics, sitting arrangements are very cozy, some of them are high rise chairs suitable for friend groups and some are conventional type suitable for family dining, the place has a open kitchen just as you enter the restaurants, baking pizzas in the traditional stone oven. Next to it is display  their large fine wine collection. Overall the ambience and the decor will make one hungry. 
Food: since I visited the place as a part of the Zomato and Kolkata Foodie Group, selective menu was put in place for us. 
First came the vodka based cocktail. Made absolutely refreshing with dash of mint and lemon in it. 
Next came the mushroom soup, warm, hearty and has an aftertaste of chicken liver. Topped with fresh cream,the soup was very smooth and had perfect balance of all the spices. 
Couple of leafy veg and non veg salads were served, all had very nice dressings and was pairing perfectly with the soup. 
Next came the pizzas. The classic veg margarita with tomato based sauce and fresh mozzarella with dash of fresh basal leaf. Tasted absolutely wonderful. 
The next pizza with white creamy base topped with fresh parmesan cheese and chicken was an absolute wonder. As advised by the manager I tried the pizza with some extra virgin olive oil,and the taste go lifted to an another level. This place makes its pizza bases with the authentic double zero flour that is typically used in Italy. All the pizzas came in thin crust. They don't make thick crust.(THE MANAGER ALSO ADVISED US TO EAT THE PIZZA WITH OUR HANDS. SO LEAVE THE FANCY CUTLERY AND TRY TO EAT PIZZA WITH HAND IF YOU ARE VISITING THIS PLACE) 
After the pizza came the pastas.
This place makes its own fettuccini pasta.The fettuccini pasta with white sauce and chicken was marvellous,it was creamy nicely salty and had the taste of nice cheese taste. The penne pasta in red sauce was tangy and hot and had a perfect taste that suits the Indian taste buds. Penne pasta came with variety of sauces white and red, veg and non veg, and all tasted equally good. 
Coming to desserts, the classic italian dessert Pinacotta was served. With perfect sweetness and little sparkling of dried mint leaves the pinacotta tasted absolutely wonderful. Next came the Tiramisu. Lovely fluffy cream, cocoa 
powder, espresso dipped lady finger biscuits, the Tiramisu had a dominating flavour over the pinacotta. So if you are planning to have pinacotta and tiramisu at the same time, have the pinacotta first. 
The place played a nice host, with smiling staffs, knowledgeable floor and restaurant manager, this place is surely a Italian food paradise.

I was craving for ravioli for a couple of months and then decided to try out from the best in the city. So Saturday noon under the scorching sun me and my wife started towards Quest mall to lunch at Serafina. We made our reservation from the car and when we reached around 2.30 we were immediately taken to our seat. 
Ambience: nice, cozy and quiet. 
Service: prompt and well behaved. 
Food: we went for Ala carte. For starters we ordered mushroom cappuccino soup. It was straight like the dishes you get to see in the masterchef. The mushroom flavor was crying out loud in each spoon. For drinks I couldn't help but order a Long Island Ice
tea. Next came a cold chicken salad. It was super refreshing with the raisins giving a sweet punch in between. Then came the motive behind going there Ravioli with porcini mushrooms.  A dish full of cheese and 10 super delicate raviolis. It was a bliss to the mouth as soon I took a spoonful. The sauce and the ravioli both were amazing. There was also a plate of Fillet Mignon and it was cooked to perfection without going overboard. We were already content but the cherry on the top for this gastronomical extravaganza were the desserts. My favorite Tiramisu was top notch( not the best in the city though as I liked the one from Hyatt La Cucina better ) and Pannacotta.  It was the best Pannacotta I ever had and I had in very less places. 
Price: If you are going a la carte it'll burn a hole in your pocket. The tax almost amounts to a lunch in a midscale restaurant. However we knew what we were signing for. 
Recommendation: This is strongly recommended for Italian food lovers and to me this along with La Cucina are the two best Italian in the city of joy.

Real Joy in the city of joy.
This ¬†is a pure Italian restaurant ¬†which transforms you to Milan , Rome , Turin ¬†etc its not advised for people wishing to stay in India or South East Asia. ¬†The decor is superb with ¬†a touch of informality, we had our dinner at the outside area which was very spacious and relaxed.¬†

Drinks: Superb Drinks collection( Specialty Wines) ¬†and exotic cocktails / drinks.¬†

Food: was very delicate and undoubtedly the best Italian you can get in the city . ¬†I was lost in the warm n creamy Chicken Mushroom Cappuccino soup.. this was one of the best soup I had. then went nuts to the crunchy Serafina Chicken salad done with pine-nuts., which was amazing and very different for the normal salads. Pizzas and Pasta was also beyond compare and easily the best in the city. However the real stars was the PannaCotta and Tiramisu which was absolutely a true work of art and not food. I really dont have the words to explain how beautiful it was , One needs to just taste it once and find the truth.

Pricey Huh? Well all good and quality things comes at a price, however it did delivered on what it promised with perfection, When all the ingredients etc are imported from France/Italy along-with un-paralled service of the staff' we know there's a lil price to pay, however its very affordable. ¬† This place is totally value for money to which the Connoisseurs will agree.

Final words: a MUST VISIT and feel the HIGH.

Kolkata has never really had a fine-dining Italian restaurant, despite Kolkata being home to almost all popular global cuisines. Barring a few sporadic attempts by some and a string of over-priced pizzerias, Kolkatans really hadn't had a tryst with Italian fare. But that was before 2013. The Quest Mall at Park Circus opened up in 2013 and Kolkatans finally welcomed a classic gourmet fine-dining Italian restaurant, Serafina. Located on the 5th floor of Quest Mall, Serafina offers a truly gastronomic affair. I was invited to Serafina as part of the Zomato Foodie Meet-up in association with Kolkata Foodie's. I cannot thank Ms. Samridhi Sanghvi of Zomato and Mr. Shaunak Bagaria of Kolkata Foodie's enough 
for the gesture. 
I was one of the first guests to arrive at Serafina and was warmly welcomed by Ms. Sanghvi and the Serafina management. Now, Serafina represents a classic example of Italian and American swag. Warm interiors, subdued colours, yet understated elegance... there's even kind of an al fresco dining should you wish to sit outside and enjoy the views (well technically al fresco dining relates to outdoor sitting arrangements, and this isn't typical al fresco per se). Anyway, so now coming to the most important part, the food. The menu was carefully curated to reflect the best of Serafina. 
We started the gastronomic trail with "Single Malt Taliskar whiskey" and "Capriosca", a classic Ketel One Vodka based cocktail. Celebrity bartender Maxim was in the house to stir up the cocktails. The Talisker whiskey based cocktail was a tad bit sweet to my liking due to the use of cherry jam and I was happy with the Capriosca, a vodka Mojito without the mint.
The drinks were quickly followed by the soups. We had an option of Minestrone and Mushroom Cappuccino. The Mushroom cappuccino seemed to be the house favourite. It was a tasty mushroom broth simmered with cream; add a dash of pepper to that and you get something extraordinary. The soup was followed by a selection of four salads, all great in their own right. The Mista Verde is a garden fresh seasonal salad. D.Chopra stood out because of the delicious cherry tomatoes and the caramelised walnuts. The non-veg salads included Di Sofia, Serafina's version of the classic Caesar salad and Serafina chicken salad. I found the Serafina chicken salad more enticing, possibly because of the pesto dressing (something which is rarely used in salads, at least in this part of the globe) and the use of roasted nuts.
The salads were followed by the pizzas. The vegetarian option was Pizza Margherita with imported "fior di latte" mozzarella, sundried tomatoes and fresh basil. The amazingly thin crust pizza and the simple toppings made it a class act. However, it was a tad too tangy for me, but nothing that I cnt live with. The clear winner was the non-vegetarian Alla Norcina, a mushroom and sliced chicken pizza with an overdose of cheese. It was subtly spiced and amazingly thin and crunchy. Drizzle olive oil on our pizzas and you will be amazed that such a simple condiment can add an entirely new dimension to your pizza. 
The pizzas were followed by the pastas. Penne Primavera all Arrabbiata was the spicy vegetarian pasta with home-made spiced Arrabbiata and seasonal fresh veggies like broccoli, zucchini and peppers. The spiced Arrabbiata was a tad bit tangy to my liking. However, the non-vegetarian pasta was simply outstanding. Tagliolini Con Petti Di Pollo was a simple pasta of home-made fettuccini, tender chicken morsels, baby peas...all simmered in a thick white sauce with a dab of cream and cheese. My quest for a delicious pasta ends here. Add a dash of chilli flakes and condiments and you have the most comforting pasta in the world. 
The meal ended with two great desserts. The Panna Cotta was the first one to arrive at the table. A souffl√© (kind of) of fresh vanilla and cream. There was a hint of lemon grass which added a nice lemony zing to the dish. The Panna Cotta was sprinkled with dried mint  leaves and served with a strawberry and mixed fruit compote. However, take my word for it, the Panna Cotta tastes great on its own and you will be better off without the compote. The compote kind of kills the subtle lemony zing of the Panna Cotta. The last dish of the evening was the Tiramisu. They say "Save the best for the last" and the Tiramisu did full justice to the saying. It was simply outstanding, in fact it left all the foodies there craving for more. A simple recipe of sponge cake, ground coffee and cocoa powder...it was simply a slice of heaven on a plate. The Tiramisu was so amazingly good that I can revisit Serafina over and over again only to savour the Tiramisu.
Serafina offers the finest gourmet Italian cuisine that you can get in Kolkata. The Serafina management is great and the personal interaction with the customers takes the dining experience to an altogether different level. I must, in conclusion, thank Zomato and Kolkata Foodie's for the invite accorded to me. And to Serafina, "A presto"!!!!

Easily some of the best food that is available in Kolkata. I had a traditional pasta - Paglia and Fieno, and their specialty in the La Focaccia section. Both dishes were amazing. Also I loved the Lychee and Ginger Mojito and the Tiramisu. All the food was of a very high standard. My one complaint would be the pricing. Serafina is also easily one of the most expensive restaurants in Kolkata as well, it also adds a hefty 10 percent service charge. At the end of the day, if you are dining at Serafina you should be expecting to pay a premium price for premium food.

Dinner at Serafina on Friday was a superb experience. A very big thank you
to "Zomato" and "Kolkata Foodies" for the lovely invite. The food was outstanding and the so was the company. And spending hours with fellow foodies discussing our favourite topic 'food' along with amazing food, I couldn't have asked for more.

Serafina is an Italian speciality restaurant located on the 5 th floor of Quest Mall.

A special bartender, Maxim was in-house for the evening to tantalize our taste buds with the most unique cocktails.
The option for the base was between Talisker whisky and Ketel One vodka.

I chose the one with Talisker whisky, and I wanted my drink to be on the sweeter side . So I got a beautiful drink with cherry jam for sweetness. It was a wonderful concoction topped with loads of crushed ice and mint leaves.

Coming to the food. It was a double treat
First the eyes eat and then you actually eat. Superb presentation.

I started my meal with ;
Mushroom Cappuccino: We had an option between Minestrone Soup and Mushroom Cappuccino. This soup was a sheer delight for a mushroom fanatic like myself. It was mushroom goodness in every spoon. The addition of freshly crushed black pepper just made wonderful even better.

Then came the salads
There were 4 salad options Two Veg and two non veg.
The Vegetarian ones were:

The DK Chopra Salad : This salad is a must must try for vegetarians. It is absolutely delicious. I took three helpings and stopped as else I wouldnt have space for other courses.

The Mista Verde Salad: This salad was great in terms of colour and presentation as well as in terms of taste. Carrots, cherry tomatoes, salad leaves and a beautiful dressing.

The Non Vegetarian ones:

The Serafina salad : This salad was delicious for sure . I did have a few salad leaves off the side despite being vegetarian after hearing praises from my fellow foodies.

Di Sofia salad was the other non vegetarian option.

The main course followed.
Alla Norcino: A chicken and mushroom pizza

Margherita V.I.P. : A beautiful thin crust pizza with dollops of buffalo cheese and torn basil leaves over a bed of a delicious tomato sauce. It was really good.

Pasta Primavera di Arabiatta: The red sauce pasta with broccoli and zucchini pieces. The pasta was an example of the best 'al dente' pasta I've had.

Tagliolini Con petti di pollo ( was the original chicken version served) We vegetarians requested for the mushroom version of this one. Baby peas , broccoli and mushroom and the best white / cheeese sauce. The pasta ( they make their own pasta) was the ultimate.

Desserts:
Lemon grass Panna Cotta : After tasting we were supposed to guess the flavor. It was lemony but not sour. So it had to be lemon grass. They also used some lemon leaves. And it was served with a strawberry and lemon compote. Being a lemon dessert lover, I was thrilled.

The Tiramisu: In short if I have to describe the Tiramisu with one phrase it would be drool-worthy. It was melt in the mouth. And I gobbled it up, spoonful after spoonful. I haven't eaten something so heavenly I felt. I strongly recommend every one to try this once for sure. I'm sure no one can eat just one.

Serafina is bejewelled by a gorgeous wood fire oven , the flames visible from afar. And getting perfect hand tossed pizzas getting baked is a visual treat.

There is an extensive variety of wines to pair with the food. There is a brunch on every Sunday 12-4 pm. Heard loads about it. Hope to visit and try it soon.

For a while, we‚Äôve been on the lookout for quality Italian food in the city, and although there certainly isn‚Äôt a dearth of restaurants calling themselves ‚ÄòAuthentic Italian‚Äô, we were in for a huge surprise when we dined at Serafina, a cosy and tastefully done restaurant on the 5th Level of Quest Mall, Kolkata. If you‚Äôre looking for genuine, heartwarming Italian food, Serafina is where your search ends. Thanks to Zomato and Kolkata Foodies, we were invited as a group of guests for a special taste-off at Serafina and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food here is amazing...every mouthful is delicious!

We began the evening with cocktails. The ‚ÄòSingle Malt Talisker‚Äô is a heady cocktail of Single Malt Whiskey with a cherry base, jam and mint. The Capriosca is a vodka mojito without mint, which makes it stand out among the vodka mojitos in the present scene. Eventually, it was time to move on to the appetizers. We were served the Minestrone and the Mushroom Cappuccino. The Minestrone was smooth and the added vegetables made it all the more delicious. The texture of the Mushroom Capuccino was good and the added cream made it a delight!

In the salad course, we had a variety of choices. We had the Di Sofia, the Serafina Chicken Salad, the Di Chopra and the Mista Verde. The Di Sofia was our absolute favourite of all of them and the Di Chopra is a must-have for all the vegetarians out there.

For the main course, we were served Margharita V.I.P. and the Alla Norcina. We were told that all the pizzas are hand-rolled, which makes them all the more special. The sauce was creamy and delicious while the base was crisp and light. For pastas, we had a selection of Penne Primavera Arrabiatta and the Tagliolini Con Petti Di Pollo. The second was an instant fav. It was creamy and elting in the mouth..honestly, the best pasta we've had in a long while.

The dessert was the most anticipated course. We had the Panna Cotta and the Tiramisu. While the Panna Cotta was refreshing and cleansed our palates with its light lemongrass flavour, the Tiramisu was a smashout! It was decadent and a slice of heaven on a plate. This is the one dish that you should be on the lookout for! Another tidbit is that the Tiramisu is an eggless preparation, so its a must-have for all!
                                          ...

On the fifth floor of the Quest mall, this restaurant serves authentic Italian food. We went for the big Apple brunch menu. Here you can choose your own salad,pasta and pizza ingredients. Staffs are very courteous. Food was good except trimasu. I don't know why my trimasu was not upto the mark though people appreciate their trimasu the most.

Serafina is located on the fifth floor of Quest Mall,Ballygunge.I got an invitation¬† for the 'Zomato Foodie Meetup' from the Zomato team and 'Kolkata Foodies' and I cannot thank Samridhi of Zomato and Mr.Shaunak Bagaria 'Kolkata¬† foodies' enough for the grand experience that I had last night. I was the first guest at the venue and I was cordially welcomed by Samridhi and The Serafina team.Gradually other guests started to arrive and within twenty minutes we were all ready for the amazing night.It felt really good to¬† meet other foodies and I thank Zomato again for this.

We were greeted by 'Single Malt Talisker','Kettle One Vodka Mocktails' and 'aerated beverage'.I opted for the Coke .Bread baskets began to arrive along with butter cubes.We were asked to¬† choose one soup between 'Minestrone' and 'Mushroom Cappuccino'.All of us went for the 'Mushroom Cappuccino' which tasted a bit bland at first but with the addition of black pepper the taste increased manyfolds. I had the soup with the bread.The bread was fresh and went really well with the soup.

Coming to Salad,we had a few options such as 'Serafina Chicken Salad','Chicken Caesar Salad','D Chopra Salad' etc.All the salads were sinfully delicious and satisfied my taste buds.

For pizza we had two options-'Margherita V.I.P' and 'Alla Norcina'.The 'Margherita V.I.P' was a chicken pizza made on a cream base¬† with mozzarella chesse(if I am not wrong).The pizza tasted divine and on using extra virgin olive oil,oregano and chilli flakes,the taste increased exponentially.The best part was the thin,crunchy and tasty crust on the side.The 'Alla Norcina' pizza was another great pizza.It was made with imported Italian 'fior di latte' mozzarella,tomato sauce and fresh basil leaves.I never knew that a veg pizza can taste so good.I loved it.

Now coming to the Pasta we again had two options-'Penne Primavera All Arrabbiata' and 'Tagliolini Con Petti Di Pollo'.The 'Penne Primavera All Arrabbiata' was a veg pasta which was made with spicy tomato sauce with garden fresh vegetables such as broccoli etc and crushed red pepper.It tasted good but the tomato sauce felt a bit overpowering.The 'Tagliolini Con Petti Di Pollo' was the tastiest pasta and it was made with homemade chicken,baby peas and fresh cream.They even make their own pasta.

Lastly,it was time for desserts and we had two options again-'Panna Cotta' and 'Tiramisu'.The Panna Cotta was made with fresh vanilla along with lemon grass and lemon leaves.It was sprinkled with dried mint leaves.This was a delicious dish.The consistency of the panna cotta was perfect and we had had it two kinds of jam-mango and mixed fruit.However the star of the night was the 'Tiramisu'.It is the best dessert that I have ever tasted.It overshadowed the Panna Cotta.I will go back again and again for the Tiramisu.All in all,it was a great experience and I am looking forward to more foodie meetups.

The only restaurant In Kolkata where I could not finish my meal owing to quality of food. Expensive decor and warm people may invite people in but only the quality of food would keep them happy would bring them back. 
Ordered the soup of the day(veg, option suggested by the server) which was a bowl of tasteless orange fluid with veggies floating. Bland and almost borderline inedible! 
Then we thought we were courageous and was hopeful that our bad experience with the soup could be made up with the starter. We ordered Calamari. Batter fried calamari with a tomato sauce. The calamari was dripping in excess oil and was equally tasteless. The tomato sauce wasnt good enough to salvage the situation either. Bad experience!

Two weeks hence...
Food presides over most of the things in life, I opine but the realisation of a mistake made and the impact on it to the brand like this along with the most important thing, to make customers happy propelled me to add this bit to the review.
I had gone back to Serafina to give myself, the food and the lovely people there a second chance. And it was one of the rightest decisions taken by me. 
We tried the same soup and the same batter fried calamari along with a spicy chicken starter and the quality of food was exponentially better than last time. We even tried a spicy chicken starter, the special chicken salad, minced chicken pizza, Pasta Bolognese and the Tiramisu was the cherry on top. Every single preparation was made with utmost care and it reflected fabulously on the food.
Lastly (but not the least bit at all), the greetings and the care given to us by the management speaks volumes of its eagerness to make the customers happy which made a lot of difference. Thank you Serafina, for a wonderful experience! I hope you throve on, in your endeavour to make people happy with food!

What an amazing get together !! #kolkatafoodies #zomatomeetup

From the start to end, the experience was just mind blowing!! Yes, I'm talking about the Kolkata Foodies meet at Serafina with the Zomato team. All thanks to the warm invitation extended by Samridhi Of Zomato to us selected few which were fortunate enough to savour the delectable dishes presented in the most symptoms manner by the very friendly and courteous team of Serafina. 

We were greeted with smiles by one and all at the wonderful restaurant alongwith amazing Talisker single malt and kettle one vodka cocktails by celebrity bartender .....and bread baskets. From the Mushroom Cappuccino/minestrone , to the different types of veg and chicken salads, the delicious main course comprising of mouthwatering pizzas and pastas, all of it was awesome!! The cherry on the cake, however, was my ever favourite and sinfully divine Tiramisu, which won our hearts!! 

Loved every bit of it! The food quality and presentation today changed my perception about Serafina. I look forward to trying much more in this restaurant :)

Located on the 5th floor of Quest Mall, Kolkata, Serafina offers authentic Italian food. The d√©cor of the restaurant is top notch and completely enticing as well as beautiful ‚Äì a perfect place for fine dining. Had heard a lot about this place especially their Big Apple Brunch; so decided to give it a try with one of my friends on a Sunday afternoon.¬†

Firstly, let me tell you that the servicemen there are well trained, courteous and helpful. They greeted us well on entering which is significantly impressive. Now as for the Big Apple Brunch, it‚Äôs huge. Completely spellbound! - More so since they offer a complimentary drink with the Big Apple Brunch. We were offered a wide variety of drinks to choose from as a complimentary drink - be it a bottle of chilled Beer or a glass of mocktail. However, we preferred two glasses of Sangria which were served first and foremost and it felt really exotic. We were completely blown away by their gesture, courtesy and service by then. Surely there‚Äôs the saying ‚Äì ‚ÄúFirst impression is the last impression‚Äù.

So for starters we ordered a ‚ÄòPancake with whipped cream and honey‚Äô along with ‚ÄòFabulous scrambled eggs‚Äô, and ‚ÄòCream of Chicken Soup‚Äô. Now, as for the scrambled eggs one can ask the chef to prepare it the way they like ‚Äì all one‚Äôs got to say is the various combination of ingredients the scrambled eggs will consist of. My friend wanted the scrambled eggs to have lots cheese and cream while I liked it with cheese, coriander and chilli. Within 5-10 minutes the dishes arrived at our table and the aroma of the food just forced us to dive into it. The eggs, soup and pancake were soft, cooked perfectly and just melted in our mouth.

Next arrived the Appetizers which we had wished for ‚Äì Bruschetta, Calamari and Arrabiata spiced chicken. All were unique in their own place but it was the calamari that stood out among the appetizers. Wow! And it‚Äôs just the Appetizers that we have now completed. 

Subsequently, our main course arrived which consisted of Pollo Grigliato, Mini sliders, and pasta. Damn! Pollo Grigliato caught my attention more because of its presentation. It was simply supreme and it not only looked beautiful but tasted even better. The chicken with the sauce and mashed potatoes will definitely win one‚Äôs heart. The Mini sliders were basically burgers with French fries and tomato sauce but the pasta ‚Äì uff! Never had anywhere in Kolkata such awesome pasta. One can have their pasta prepared according to their choice of pasta, sauce, veggies and meat. I had Fettucini pasta in Pomodoro sauce with Broccoli, corn, bell peppers, sausages and bacon. Really worth it! But the main course was yet to be over as we had ordered for a pizza as well. By this time we were almost full and had already spent almost two hours enjoying the delicacies of authentic Italian cuisine at Serafina, Kolkata. 

Finally, arrived the desserts ‚Äì the ever lustrous and yummy Tiramisu. One must have the Tiramisu when at Serafina. The presentation, taste, the softness of the Tiramisu was just like the cherry on the cake. Would definitely revisit here sometime again especially for the Tiramisu and of course for the Big Apple Brunch.

The only concern one can have is the pocket pinch but then again it‚Äôs just worth it. Would recommend all to have a try here at least once. Great going Serafina, Kolkata! Keep it up! :)

The ambience is good, the staff is courteous and well trained. We ordered a Tiramisu which was excellent. However did not like the veg ravioli we ordered. We also ordered a white sauce based veg pasta which was bland. We visited this restaurant during the weekend and the waiting time for a table was around 5 min which is a huge plus.

Serafina is definitely a must visit for Italian food enthusiasts.  Good ambience, great food, prompt service. I went with my family and we enjoyed our lunch.  The Pink paradise mojito and Cinderella were refreshing. ...the fish fingers made to order were excellent with a fresh tartar and fries. The pizza with chicken mince and cheese topping was great ...but the Tiramisu was to die for. ..One has to go back again and again for the heavenly tiramisu. Though the pinch on the pocket hurt, but overall a good experience.

Had a great time tonight. Staff welcomed us warmly and we got a table right away. Ordered grilled chicken, Margherita VIP for main course; LIIT and Caprioska for drinks and of course our favourite Tiramisu for desserts. Food was a perfect 10/10. The Margherita was the best I've ever had. It's become one of our favourite places now.

This place can be better. I waiting staff is great, good service, ambience is a 7 out of 10 but these guys really need to expand their menu. Too few things to chose from. I had the Fillet Mignon, which was good, I would recommend it to others. But it would be nice if we had more choices. Nice selection of Wines and a good Bar. Over all an average place. But if it wants to survive it has to check it's prices (a tad too high) and it has to expand the menu.

Amazing ambience, superb collection of alcohol and the best Tiramisu in the city are the USPs of this place. Had grilled fish with mashed potato which was awesome. Sea food risotto was also ok, just that risottos aren't really my thing.. And the Tiramisu was worth a few drops of tears (it was that good). Give it a visit, of you have enough in your pockets!!

Zomato, please start introducing a zero star option. This place deserves nothing better than the same. Worthless food. Sunfeast pasta is better than the one served here. We chose the selection menu and not the regular A la Carte one. So I was wondering if that made a difference. The management seriously needs to look into the taste aspect for the exorbitantly priced food that it is offering. The lemongrass creme brulee was a respite and so was the panseared gnocchi with spinach sauce. Overall,  highly disappointed.

Zomato I think u should start introducing the zero star too cuz this restaurant is not even worth for 1 star. The quantity was very less even if the quantity was so less we expected atleast the taste would be fine but even that was not worth... So please try to avoid visiting this restaurant... Crappy place and waste of money...

Serafina keeps me happy, especially during those days when I want to eat good Italian food. Their Sunday brunch is quite extensive, with a Tiramisu to die for and great pizzas, fried calamari, and pastas.
                                                                ...

Very nice food. Tastes just like italian food which you will find in italy. Risotto and pasta was really good. Minestrone soup was also delicious. The pizzas were thin crusted (just like the ones in a real italian pizzeria). Also the tiramisu is absolutely delicious. MUST HAVE. It is a bit overpriced though.

I can comment only on the Big Apple Brunch here because that is what kept us occupied for nearly four hours. Between the three of us, at our table, we tried almost everything. The made to order omelettes and choose-your-own-ingredients salads were tasty. My friends loved the batter fried calamari and I enjoyed the harissa spice-rub coated chicken and the creamy soup. After that we were full but just kept eating because we couldn't pass up good Italian food. The risotto Primavera contained al dente vegetables and tasted a bit like khichdi...a bit too much tomato there probably. The pastas were delectable though it was the farfalle in cream sauce that gets my vote over the pesto fettucine. The pizza, we admit having gone overboard with the toppings, was not the best pizza I've had. But oh my God the desserts! I can't believe I'm saying this but I'd rate their Creme Caramel and their Pana Cotta higher than the Tiramisu....and this coming from a coffee lover. At bursting point we made room for seconds....that's how divine these were!

Nice place. Liked the calamari, lamb chops and pork ribs. Ambience is fine. However, our drinks were quite diluted, and only after complaining twice, they managed to get it somewhat right. Servers are polite. The experience was fine, nothing exceptionally memorable, but nothing very wrong either.

Thinking about serafina only one thing comes in mind that is their tiramisu, its lyk out of world, never had such tiramisuüíü before, best from the city as per my experience.

Now coming to the interiors so ya they do have good decor with dim lights inside, candle on the table, so to enjoy your best candle light date and to munch on with the yummiest italian cuisines, red bricked walls with decorative plates encrypted on it. Colourful and delightful, yellow lighted hanging lamp shades and perfect sofas and chairs to just sit and enjoy the meal. Not only the inside one their outside sitting which makes it more intresting, nd the yellow scooter outside gives a quirky look to it. Starffs are pretty courteous.

Loved it, will surely visit next time, visit this place and just have their tiramisu. For sure you'll even become a fan like me!!. Happy dining!.

I absolutely love this place. Great service, amazing food. I specially love the Margherita cheese pizza. It's one of the best pizzas I've ever had. For dessert I always go for the tiramisu and the vanilla pannacota. It might be a bit on the pricy side but I feel it's worth it. I'd definitely recommend this joint for maybe a date night or even otherwise.

The most upsetting experience at Serafina today . I was hosting my birthday lunch with a group of 12 girls.... n Serafina left no leaf unturned to ruin my day.. really not worth a single rupee paid in that place.. I ordered the set menu.. the food quality was exceedingly compromised to suit the price. Absolutely pathetic.

I had dinner here. I did not understand a single word on the menu card üòÑ, mostly envisaged via the descriptions and help from our waiter.All I can say is we had a pizza and something resembling a meat roll. Everything about the pizza was perfect, the meat roll was perfectly cooked and was extremely pleasing when you take a bite.The cost is on the upper side but the food is very enjoyable. If you decide to wash down the food with a little helping of white wine, the taste amplifies a bit.

I had been to Serafina during my last visit to Kolkata. Italian, being one of my favourite cusines, I just had to come here to try the food. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and it is by far one of the best Italian eateries in Kolkata. My family and I ordered the bruschetta, risotto and spaghetti and it was just right. Would visit this place again whenever I am in Kolkata.

My friend and I met for lunch here yesterday. We opted for the set 6 course meal offered during lunch time. The food was not too pleasing for us, unfortunately. The soup was bland and just so-so. The seafood salad was too salty. The calamari ordered for starters was greasy with a lot of oil in the plate and too salty as well. The pizza was a savior. The chicken main course was also just so-so. Enjoyed the creme brulee for dessert. I have heard of many positive reviews of this place. Would like to give it another try when we order from the actual menu instead of the pre fixed one. Their Sunday brunch too sounded interesting.

Delicious food and soothing ambience with attentive service. Tried it for the first time and liked all that we ordered - whether it was the Goat Cheese salad or the Gnocchi. Possibly the only reason it's not more packed is that the prices are on the higher side. Still, I'm glad to have discovered...

Do you know how old the concept of brunch is? Nearly 120 years! The word appeared in print for the first time in the US in 1896.¬†‚ÄúThe latest ‚Äòfad‚Äô is to issue invitations for a meal called ‚Äòbrunch‚Ä¶a repast at 11 o‚Äôclock a.m.,‚Äù a column in the New Oxford, an old Pennsylvania newspaper¬†explained. In India, the concept reached much much later and in Kolkata, I think it has been only a couple of years since restaurants and hotels introduced elaborate Sunday brunches. And one of the best in the city right now is The Big Apple Brunch at Serafina,¬†inspired by the¬†iconic New York style Sunday brunches.

So disappointed at the jumbo prawns. They were baby ones and being charged a arm and a leg for it. First it was hard and returned. Again it was baby prawns. Chef said that these baby prawns were jumbo for them. It seems he was using a magnifying glass to cook them. Why call them jumbo. You can see in the snap. 
Air conditioning was so poor that we had to shift locations and still we were sweating. AC just doesn't work.

One of the best places to get your Italian taste buds a treat.
The food,the place all good but it is way too costly,i mean the costing hilarious,u can get a 5star hotel dinner at that cost.
Here's hoping that the cost becomes a lil reasonable so that people can taste the awesome food without being forced to sell their car.

This was my review when I first visited this place but my second visit was a nightmare....
Although I ordered the fixed lunch menu....the food was a joke in terms of taste and quantity.
You pay 1000bucks for this shit.
Seriously disappointing....beware people whatever they say it is a lie.

I absolutely love a good Sunday Brunch and Serafina does a terrific one. They call it The Big Apple Brunch and I was there last Sunday and it turned out to be a wonderful meal. Ciroc was on board as the beverage partner and they had some delicious cocktails to go with the brunch Mango Martini , Watermelon Martini , Cucumber Caprioska were all excellent and summer delights. There was a Salad Bar where you could mix your own salad as well as a live egg counter where your choice of eggs were made fresh. There was a selection of Bruschetta , some delicious Calamari and Chicken , Pizzas , Chicken Sliders , Pastas and Dessert. I loved the Mango Martini which was excellent , the Calamari was perfectly done not rubbery and overcooked , ¬†the Pesto Pasta and the Fettuchini in Cheese Sauce were gorgeous and I am still dreaming of the Tiramisu. What was a bit of a let down was the Creme Brulee which I hope was a one off thing. Maxime Grivel the Diego Brand Ambassador was present and had designed the Ciroc Cocktail Menu and was there to interact with us which only added to an even greater experience. Highly recommended !

We went to Serafina to have the Big Apple Brunch. 

The first thing we experienced was the very friendly staff courtesy. We didn't have much idea about what to eat because it was the first time we were having food there. But the staff helped us in every step of the menu. 

Talking about the food. It was just excellent. 

Starting from the salad. We had an initial about what all to choose but again we got some help from the staff. Everything in the salad was very fresh and refreshing. 

Moving on to the starters. Mouthwatering is the right word. 

We had the bruschetta with Arrabiata Spiced Chicken and Calamari.

Arrabiata Spieced Chicken reminded me a little of the KFC popcorn chicken but it stops right there. This was much much better in terms of taste. 

This is the first time we had the Calamari. We ended up cleaning up a basket full of it.  So its self explanatory how good it was. And its so light on the appetite compared to chicken. 

Moving on...

We just had a bit of pasta as our appetite was slowing down. and waited for the main course to come. Which was, Pollo Grigliato. We were not in a hurry though. By the time the main course came , we finished our pasta and were ready for the main course

We finished the chicken in a few minutes and actually ordered another plate because it was delicious. The grilled chicken breast pieces were perfectly paired with the mashed potato. It was perfect.

And then came the desert...

We ordered the tiramisu which we knew about. And the staff said its the best here.

It was very tasty as usual. But the star attraction was our second desert.

The Pannacota. Oh it was so inviting...without even tasting it.

It was so beautiful to even look at. The taste was even better, and the best part is...as we had two deserts, they never made us feel we had too much sweet.
We could have had a few more but we stopped at two.

Must mention that we were so full, we skipped the Pizza. They said its one of their best to have at Serafina. But we planned to keep it for the next trip.  

Must say the brunch is worth a trip. And do come empty stomach. :-P

This restaurant is a branch of a NY based chain and is one of the few speciality Italian restaurants still surviving in Kolkata. It tries to create the feel of an European cafe with outdoor seating, despite being situated inside a shopping mall. I initially wanted to try a Pizza, but Pizzas were unavailable due to a problem with the oven. This was a bit of a turn off, coming from an Italian restaurant with a long list of Pizzas on their menu. Anyway, I then ordered the Belgian pork chops and Tiramisu. My initial feeling of disappointment was then assuaged as both the dishes turned out to be of the highest quality. The pork was soft and juicy and it went very well with the mashed potatoes, while the aubergine caviar added a nice creative twist to the dish. The tiramisu is one of the best on offer in Kolkata. The portions were generous. But mind it, this is one expensive place with prices almost at par with what we expect at five star properties. Hope this restaurant survives and offers me more opportunities to refresh my memories of some glorious time spent in Italy.

I and food blogger Indrajit Lahiri were invited by Serafina, to sample their Restaurant Week menu. Restaurant Week India was held from 22nd April till 1st May 2016. Twelve of Kolkata‚Äôs fine dining restaurants participated in it. In each of them a person could enjoy a set three-course menu with plenty of vegetarian or non-vegetarian options at a special price of Rs 900 plus taxes.

The restaurant has a classy d√©cor with wooden furniture and walls designed in a mix of brick theme and cream colour. We chose one of the two-seater tables lining the glass wall overlooking the outside. There is a neatly fenced dining area outside as well, with chairs and tables placed under canopies, simulating a European caf√© experience. 

We quenched our thirst with Twisted Orange Mojito recommended by the service staff. A herb-infused, refreshing fruit-based mocktail- ideal for the scorching weather now.

The set meal comprised of a starter, a main course dish and a dessert per person. As we were two, we ordered two different meals. 

I and Indrajit chose Calamari and Assortiti Crostini Platter respectively for the starters from the special Restaurant Week menu. The former was part of their regular menu and the latter was one of the two signature appetizers created for the event. The crisp, thin batter-fried Calamari (Squid preparation in Italian cuisine) went well with the spicy tomato dip which resembled Bengali homemade chicken curry.

The Assortiti Crostini Platter had four types of crostini (crisp baked bread with topping). I tried the one with ham and another with chicken. The ham was of top quality. The service staff said they were very particular about sourcing quality ingredients and use imported perma ham only. The creamy chicken mince mixed with a bit of mustard was yummy with oregano sprinkled by me on the top. Their regular menu has each of the four options separately.

I walked to the other side of the entrance as we were waiting for the main course. There is a large open kitchen and bar counter adjacent to each other there. For those who come to enjoy drinks, there are high chairs and tables.

In mains, I chose Lasagne al Forno despite being a veg dish (since I wanted pasta and didn‚Äôt like to go for spaghetti which was the only staple in non-veg) and he picked Belgium Grilled Pork Chops from the two signature options. The Lasagne was a pretty big portion for one person. This spicy dish was tasty with a crisp top and abundant veggies cooked with generous amount of cream and sauce between the pasta sheets. 

The Belgium Grilled Pork Chops floored us! We were given toothed knives to cut the meat off the rib bone (it takes some effort; mind it, which will increase as much as it is allowed to get cold). The perfectly cooked pork with the belly fat lining was brilliant with the sweet and tangy sauce. It went well with the equally well-made mashed potato (with a thick, tasty sauce) and broccoli served with it. We were almost full by now.

I had quickly picked tiramisu and Indrajit had chosen Gelati Sorbetti for the dessert. The service staff said tiramisu was their specialty. When we tasted it, we knew the claim was justified. The tiramisu with cheese cream dripping from the top gave the palate the expected flourish, created by the cream and the soaked coffee and liqueur. Serafina was noted among the best tiramisu places by us. The gelato-sorbet combo served in an almond shell was equally good. The gelato paired well with the refreshing sorbet which had the perfectly mushy consistency with concentrated fruit juice- perfect for the hot weather.

An epic meal after long! For Italian cuisine, Serafina is easily the go-to place in the premium segment.

I love the quality of food and the menu at Serafina... The truffle ravioli is to kill for as are the pork chops.. Their pizzas and salads are also interesting in variety... I specially love the salmon salad... The tiramisu is a winner as well...

I wish i could gv them 0 rating. Ordered for a thin crust chicken pizza with extra cheese n believe you me it was dry n awful the first time. We ordered another pizza n then the next one was almost dry n burnt. Called the manager n leave alone apologising they kept saying this is the way they serve. This is not the first time i ate here but this is the first time i needed to speak to the manager n trust me i felt as if it was my fault that the food was this bad.
Please don't waste your money going here just for the place coz the management n food is s**t

"Try our Tiramisu ,its the best in the city" ,never have more truer words been spoken.It truly is a beauty to look at and the hint of coffee as it melts in our mouth is a heavenly experience. Before that the Alla Norcina pizza with a glass of sparkling villa Callapiano is also something I would recommend. The only drawback is the pocket pinch. Maybe the management could give that a thought.

Last Saturday after watching FAN' I had my dinner plans at this place. Serafina is located on the 5th floor of the Quest Mall. This place serves awesome Italian cuisine. 
The ambience of this place was great. The restaurant really looked good from inside. This place fits perfect among one of those fine dining tags. The service providers seemed courteous and helpful.
We had ordered for the below food items:
‚Ä¢Veg Brushetta - This thing was quite disappointing since toasted breads were served with raw tomato toppings. That's all, it seemed like we had ordered for some raw chopped tomatoes. Because the Brushetta's I have had elsewhere is served in a quite different manner with a lot different ingredients.
‚Ä¢ Roasted Tomato Basil Soup - This soup was delicious with perfect flavour of basil in it.
‚Ä¢Cottage Cheese Steak with mushroom sauce - A chunk of paneer was served with some saut√©ed vegetables and mushroom sauce was poured over the steak. It tasted good enough. Though at times the paneer tasted quite bland.
‚Ä¢Grilled Chicken - This was tremendously yummy. The chicken was tender and juicy. The sauce poured over the chicken was great. Overall the grilled chicken won my heart. A must to order.
‚Ä¢ Pene Al Fungii in white sauce - The pasta was creamy and delicious. Though the quantity of the pasta was less. But the pasta tasted absolutely great.
‚Ä¢Red Wine Sangria - Awesome!! These people have got a huge variety of wine. Do try.

Overall my experience to this place was quite good. Italian cuisine lovers this place is for you. Though I found Serafina a little overpriced but once a while visiting such places are not a bad idea though.

Update from 26th July 2017 dinner:-

We were invited for a tasting session of the chef's special menu launched newly. This menu is designed taken into consideration the local preference and off course with a lot of fish and seafood. We were served a mushroom cappucino, which to me, was the showstopper of the day. It was perfectly seasoned and having that nice subtlety that is required. Pizza has always been one of their strong points and such was the case here. It was a nice thin crust chef's special pizza and was good. A braised vetki on a bed of mashed potato, frankly, can't go wrong and especially if the fish is a fresh catch. This dish is definitely recommended here. The Pannacotta which we tasted, was bit of a disappointment and I don't frankly recommend that.¬†

From 2016:-

                        We visited this place during the Restaurant Week India 2016 event and the experience is based on it.¬†

The decor was top-notch and there's in-house as well as outside seating there. We chose to sit inside. The standard condiments were served along with the refreshing fresh orange Mojito, which set the tune for the evening. 

¬†¬†
There was a special menu for the Restaurant week and we were supposed to choose one item per person from each of the 3 sections- starters, main course and dessert. For starters, we chose the Assorted Crostini Platter. It had 4 crostinis (sort of hard toasted bread) with Chorizo, chicken mince, a creamy prawn spread and ham (thankfully Parma) and cheese on almost all. It was pure bliss. Also, we had, upon suggestion, a basket of fried calamari with a spicy tomato based sauce. Frankly, after having the crostini platter, the calamari rings were a bit of a disappointment (not bad though). But by now, we understood one thing, the portion size here was going to be really huge, and we were not wrong. 

For main course, we saw in the menu, there was Belgian Pork Chops and one choice was made. For the other portion, we had homemade Lasagne with fresh vegetables. The separate steak knife was given and when the food arrived, we were literally stunned to see the Lasagne. It was a huge portion and can easily be divided among 2. Pork chop was great and the subtle smell of orange was there to add to the taste. ¬†

We were searching for which sdessert to choose, when the server insisted we chosethe Tiramisu. For the other portion, we chose Gileti Sorbetti (served in almond shell). But, once they arrived, we were repenting our choice. We should have ordered 2 portions of Tiramisu instead. The Sorbetti was good, in fact very good. But, the Tiramisu was probably the best that we had in Kolkata..... A huge sized piece of creamy heaven- that's tiramisu here for you. Definitely recommended. 

We were full. For 900/-+ Tax per person, this was definitely worth. even without it, I'll denitely come back. At least for the crostini and for the tiramisu.

Went for dinner after a movie. Very good decor and excellent food. But the waiters could sport a smile once in a while, that helps their cheeks and keeps the diner at ease. One thing stumps me though, the waiters lurk around to snatch away your plates as soon as one is done. Hang on guys, I know that's good to start preparing for the next in queue (if in queue?),  but that's not good manners. Give the diner some time to play back the flavours that has just been chewed down!

A lovely meal after a wonderful movie, extremely overpriced though. We chose to sit outside, and the ambiance was perfect for a heart to heart with a close friend. The staff were courteous and gave us some great suggestions from the menu. We had the fried calamari, the Alla Norcina pizza and the panna cotta for dessert. The pizza had a thin crust baked on a wooden fire and the toppings (chicken, cheese and mushrooms) blended perfectly with each other in taste and texture. The panna cotta (which is basically a vanilla mousse) was absolutely heavenly, and that is saying something for someone who does not believe in chocolate-less desserts.¬†
We were disappointed to miss the Tiramisu, which we were told is the best in town, but they were out of stock. Next time!
On our second visit, we tried a few new items. The Bruschetta, the ham wrapped watermelon and the Rigatoni ala bolognese (with home made lamb bolognese) among them. To be honest, I did not like any of these too much although they were mostly prepared well. The ham was delicious though and I would happily eat it by itself, I did not feel the watermelon complimented it much. The pasta was initially cooked with too much salt, but after we complained, they simply cooked it some more with a sweetener. I have had better Bruschetta too. 
The desserts however were absolutely heavenly. Finally had the Tiramisu and it is certainly the best that I have ever had. Creamy and completely melt in the mouth, it is a plateful of bliss. The chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream was also great, although the wafer it came in could have been crispier. All in all, a good meal.

At first impression, Serafina lures you in with its easy on the eyes d√©cor ‚Äì the ambiance was elegant without being overpowering, and we found our seats immediately on a Friday night. The next thing that struck me was the service and the politeness of the staff. Our food arrived on the table within an appropriate amount of time as well.

Coming to the food, we had ordered the bruschetta, mushroom soup, D Chopra salad, chicken pizza and two different varieties of Arabiata pasta. As for the food, all of us devoured the tomato-filled bruschetta that tasted fresh, simple and deftly prepared. I must say, there are few restaurants that succeed in serving the perfect bruschetta, and Serafina is definitely one of them. The mushroom soup, according to my friend, was heavenly in terms of taste.

As far as the main course goes, both the Arabiata pasta (that came in whole wheat variety as well, much to the delight of health enthusiasts) were delicious. My D Chopra salad, that consisted of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, pears, avocadoes and caramelized walnuts in a dressing of lemon vinaigrette, was not only beautifully served, but was also delightfully tasty. But the award for the best order of the night goes to the chicken pizza, which was the most perfect little arrangement of atoms and molecules that I have come across. It only consisted of generous amounts of cheese and chicken on a thin crust base, but it tasted like a million dollars. A definite must try!

The only issue with Serafina, however, is the price. For all the above items, the total bill came out to be around 4000 INR. However, for a place catalogued under ‚ÄòLuxury Dining‚Äô, this much is expected. 

Rating:

Food: 4.75/5

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 3.75/5

Value for money: 3.75/5

I think that this place is the finest dining restaurant in Quest. The menu makes no sense to a person who doesn't know any amount of Italian haha. But I had to figure it out from the ingredients underneath. We ordered 4 pizzas,calamari, mocktails and a glass of vodka. I dont remember what pizzas did we order but the ham on the pizza was not up to the mark. The moctails were brilliant and apart from the ham, the thin crust pizzas and calamari were succulent and delicious.¬†Taxes were high but that should not stop a person who lives to eat from spending a great amount of time here. Cheers!

Had visited this plc a month ago and to sum up in jst sentence- it is an expensive restaurant with not much variety of food. However the plc has a nice decor along with good service but the lack of options makes it difficult for the visitors to visit agn. On my visit we had ordered pollo grigliato which was jst okayish.. The grilled chicken breasts were tender and the creamy mashed potatoes were fine too.. We also opted for a pizza called imported Italian 'fior di latte' mozzarella, tomato and fresh basil and we had asked them to add sum chicken on it. The pizza however tasted horrible. I simply fail to understand how can a simple pizza turn out to be such a disaster! I personally feel tht thy shud mk a consumer friendly menu!

Lovely experience.

We had called up the restaurant before landing up, and they told us that reservation is not required we may just walk in. Good thing is that they serve till 11pm!

However, when we reached we got high stools which was a little uncomfortable to me but on requesting the manager ¬†arranged a better table.

APPETIZERS: For starters we ordered Mini Sliders, which comes with french fries and two portion small burgers. Extremely juicy¬†patty and well made bread. Much recommended.¬†

MAIN COURSE: We ordered the Petto di pollo¬†alla¬†milanese. Although the manager suggested Chicken breast paillard we went ahead with the former. Again stole the show with its thin crust coating with hammered chicken breast inside, served with salad. ¬†Portion size was sufficient¬†for two!
Next we ordered a pizza with mozzarella, mushroom and spicy chicken. Well made, melt in the mouth cream cheese!¬†

DESSERTS: Well we did not have much space for desserts but the manager recommended Tiramisu. Thank god we tried, we would have missed a delicacy.

DRINKS: We ordered beers and Kiwi cran mojito. ¬†Cocktail was really well made.

Worth a visit. We paid 4500, in total.

I had been to Serafina on my birthday. It is on the top floor of Quest Mall. The ambience is really nice. They have seating both inside and outside and i chose to sit outside. They have a yellow scooter outside which makes for a great selfie spot.
Coming to the food, i only had bruschetta and raspberry panna cotta as i went there in the evening. Thumbs up for the presentation. Loved the food, specially the dessert.
Will definitely go back for a full meal next time.

A long discussion on Sunday brunches in Kolkata led to a visit to Serafina. Located in Quest mall, the restaurant is tiny with a few tables for outside seating as well. The sangrias were amazing,  the  omelette was light and fluffy but they were slightly heavy handed with the sausages and the bruschetta was excellent. Next we'd ordered the risotto Primavera which was again amazing,  and a really interesting chicken mince pizza with mushrooms. Last but not the least the tiramisu was mind blowing. Best I've had in ages, we ended up ordering seconds, it was just that good. This place should really be a proper restaurant and not in a mall, it really takes away from the ambience, but overall, the food experience was impeccable!

Serafina is an amalgam of spectacular food and a classy ambience. The interiors are very posh and you are treated lavishly. We helped ourselves to mushroom soup, mozarella,mushroom,spicy chicken pizza with added bacon and ham and lastly to a heavenly delight, tiramisu. Needless to say, the tiramisu was the highlight of our feast...and true to their claim, it is the best in town. We couldn't get enough. The mushroom soup was light and savoury..but the pizza fell short of our expectations. The restaurant is undoubtedly going to burn a hole in your pocket. Service is very good though. I am coming back again for tiramisu cravings!!

The typical Italian bistro. But missing Italy outside its window. Great food, great service, nice menu, nice service. Has a good selection of wine and cocktails. If you ever go there try their lamb chops, one of my favorite. Also one can go for their pork chops too. Also they have a great menu of pizzas. So if you are a pizza lover definitely go there.

Well today is my birthday so me and my mom planned to stop by serafina and what an wonderful experience we had. Truly one of the best restaurants in Calcutta. Wonderful decor, gentle ambience,good music and very courteous staff (good bunch of blokes) but the main thing is the food and it did not disappoint one bit and the drinks were good as well. We ordered calamari,bhetki fish finger,ravioli with porcini mushrooms and gnocchi and everything was made to perfection. Crispy seafood and well made soft yet and melt in your mouth pasta. The only issue I had is we ordered 4 plates of food and 4 kinds of drinks and the bill 7k. That part was horrifying. Anywho don't regret one bit. I will be back for more, soon üòÉüòÑ

So we called for 1 tomato basil soup, 1 portion of expanded named potatoes which were basically wedges.. The appetizers were decent, but then again who can go wrong with soup and wedges. Mains included pizza and ravioli. Now the menu stated 'spicy chicken' as a topping. As an Indian, naturally I expected chunks of red chicken :p.. instead what I was served was ground chicken indistinguishable from the mozzarella which tasted like snot. And the explanation I received from my server was that it's called spicy chicken because the pizza had 'chilli flakes'.. The ravioli was quite ordinary. 
So after my experience with the mains I didn't have the audacity to order anything exotic for dessert... So I called for a basic chocolate cake with ice cream. Again can't go wrong can u. Felt 4.5k lighter and a lot wiser since I decided to never visit the place again.

one of the worst places that you can go in Kolkata !!!

Went on 15th for dinner and to my surprise just 1 table was occupied. the A/C was switched off. is that what you expect in a restaurant of this grade.

we ordered for focassia, Paprika potato and pasta in white sauce from the kids menu.

All of them were bad. to eat the focassia it was like you almost had to fight and put your full energy to take a bite. looked they had made it of recycled rubber or plastic.

Have rated this place 1. Hope zomato had a option of giving nevetive points.

This is one of the worst places I've ever been to.

Visited the place a days ago. The ambience is good. Well coming to food, they were quite delicious; not "wow" though. However the service was a bit slow. We ordered Mini Slider, and Rigatoni Alla Bolognese (lamb pasta I believe) for the main course. They were delicious though quantity were poor. For drinks ordered Passion Fruit Iced Tea and Twisted Orange Mojito. They were okay. I kind of felt that the orange Mojito tasted like lemon (though I can say for sure coz never tried that beverage before). Coming to dessert all I can say that the Tiramisu was simply "wow" and we really enjoyed it. Good rating especially for the Tiramisu.

Hi Mr. Manager ... if you do exist.

Checked into this place almost an hour ago with few friends. Had heard about this place from a friend, but sadly..that is all about it.

To start with - The Bruschetta...who gives such big slices on the bread!!

Secondly, we ordered a pizza, which was supposed to be finger licking good. Well, that was about it. We are still waoting for the pizza to be delivered to our table..and it has been 75 mins and counting.

On the better side.. the mushroom soup was awesome.

Next time you want the customers to wait this long, do mention the time between ordering and serving. 

Hopefully..now the Manager would actually visit our table.

A MUST NO NO. Well this was my 1st experience.

This is one of my favorite fancy places to eat out in the city. The food here is amazing, and they certainly know how to make some mind-blowing risotto. The meats, in dark, rich, caramelized glazings are every meat-lovers' dream come true. The desserts too are elegant, specially their signature tiramisu with the ample punch of coffee.

This is the perfect place for a dinner date. It might be a little pricey, but definitely worth every penny. 

And recently they have started the Big Apple Sunday Brunch at 999/-++ and it is every bit worth getting out of bed on a Sunday.

We tried the mushroom cappuccino soup which gives a very different taste from either of its name components. Next was a grilled chicken breast which comes with grilled tomatoes and zucchini. But my recommendation goes to the braised Kolkata bhetki with mashed potato on a bed of spinach. You can also try their rosemary grilled potatoes to cleanse the palette.

Finally mustered the courage, and saved some pocket money to go to this place, which is located on the top floor of the Quest Mall at Park Circus. Not a particularly delightful experience. Went for the Non-Veg Weekday Meal Course (roughly 2000 for two people, inclusive of taxes). We ordered the 'Chicken Ceasar' Salad, a Spagetti dish and the renowned 'Chicken ala Norsina' Pizza. While the salad was a good starter, the thin crust and well-cooked pizza was quite a delight. However, the quantities are quite meagre compared to the cost (if you're not going for the Set Meal Course). Lastly, the desserts were a little disappointing. The Panna Cotta tastes like a mint-flavoured cheesecake, which doesn't suit my taste, while the 'Il Tiramisu', supposedly their best dessert has a raw coffee flavour to it, which may strike as bitter in some bites. They also serve complimentary red or white wine with the meal.
Overall, didn't quite meet my expectations, but if you're dying for some New York restaurant experience, worth a try.

The BEST pizza I've ever had! The place is brilliant. The waiters are courteous and know their job well. It's expensive, but then we are talking about an international name. I've had the calamari fries (lip smacking) and then decided to try their famous pizza (mozzarella , chicken and mushroom) . It tasted like heaven! Along with the drinks , the bill came around to 4000 bucks... So a bit of a pocket pinch. But totally worth it.

My two personal favourites here are the Sangria and their most famous dessert Tiramisu. They have great Italian food to die for. A must visit.

Ordered Bruschetta, Penn√© Primavera all √°rabita, and Italian classic pizza with mozzarella, mushroom and chicken, along with a few mocktails. We were disappointed by the awful preparation and small portion sizes. There was hardly a fistful of pasta served, bruschetta was horrible, and pizza very average. And everything heavily priced.
Just the ambiance is good, and the staff looked apologetic - hence giving a generous rating. Not like they did anything about our concerns though.
Totally avoidable, this place - unless you feel like throwing away some money!

Its been on my wish list for a long time, finally visited Serafina on 29th Nov and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. The interior is very classy. The staffs are attentive and service is fast. We ordered Ravioli ai porcini and Pizza ala norcina in main course along with cosmopolitan & beer to wash it down. We thought of ordering one more main course after finishing off the first two, but we didn't even need to think of that as those two items were so filling. Cocktail was good. Finally to end the lunch on sweet note we ordered Tiramisu and it was oh so yummy. Highly recommended Ravioli ai porcini and Tiramisu. Rs.4000+ for two people will burn a hole in your pocket/purse but totally worth it. Will visit again.

Visited Serafina with fianc√© and his sister. It was peak rush hour, so we were seated outside. But that didn't hamper the service. We ordered Grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes in barbecue sauce and spaghetti with zucchini basil and butter. The food was cooked with the authenticity of its origin. The spaghetti was very well cooked with a slight tanginess' from the zucchini. The chicken was grilled perfectly and the composition of the barbecue sauce was excellent. All in all we had a good meal.

Short version: You can pretty much skip this place. Nice ambience, bad food.
Long version: Was searching for a nice place to have lunch in quest mall. The place had a nice ambience so we gave it a try.
Ordered Bruschetta, Penn√© Primavera all √°rabita, Italian classic pizza with mozzarella, mushroom and chicken; along with a few mocktails.
After a long wait for the food, we were disappointed by the awful preparations and small portion sizes. The little amount of pasta served, was without bread; so much for authenticity! The Bruschetta was a disgrace. Pizza was average. Giving a 2.0 just for the ambience.

I went to the restaurant back when its started. Don't exactly what I had (I had a white sauce pasta , which had shrimp in it). The sauce was to thin and lacked herbs. When I informed the staff about it, they were not even bothered. I am not coming to this restaurant again.

Serafina, is a complete package. If you're looking for good food, which fills your stomach and isn't tooo oily or spicy-Serafina is perfect for you. I've tasted a variety of Italian and Mediterranaen food throughot the City of Joy, but this, has been The Best! Being situated in a prime Location like The Quest Mall and being on the same floor as Irish House, the food joint gets its required limelight. THE FOOD, Good God,The food! I love to complain about the food i eat, but the lipsmacking food here,didnt give me an option to find any flaw at all. For the starters i had oredered A Veg Bruschetta for myself and a Non veg one for my friend. along with this some Garlic Potato wedges and a Creme of Mushroom Soup. They were all very appitizing, specially the creamy Mushroom soup. One quality i really liked about the waiters was that after every dish they served, they came by to ask whether we would like some seasonings ; and that, they literally Waited On you, just to make sure that they are there for you if you need anything! Thumbs up, for that!! before i could ask for some Mayonese Dip, they almost read my mind and placed the mocktail (?) dip on the center of the table. The Cheesy Non Veg Bruschetta was "very Satisfying", accoring to my friend. For the main course, i went cliche and ordered a Large Cheesy Pizza with some Olives, Sundried Tomatoes and Sweet Corn, spiced with some Oregano. It was simply bellissimo! the Red sause spegetti arabiata was also good and so was the white sause penne pasta. The Veg Lasagna could do with a fewer veggies though, considering the fact that it left me with a Carrot-y aftertaste. However, the Pizza made up for it leaving a taste of the Burro (butter) satisfying my taste buds. The Wine Menu seemed very appealing too. The 'Wine of the Day' was a Jacob's Creek-Chardonnay , which isnt my favourite really,but well, it worked well. The Wine Cellar look on one of the walls gave the restaurant a very Classic Italian look. A friend ordered a Strawberry Mojito, which wasnt on the Mocktail menu, but she said she got 'exactly what she was expecting!'. 
Finally, for desserts i was hoping to order a Foccacia Alla Nutella, but owing to time constrains (and i was told that it would take a good 20 mins of preperation), i ordered a Chocolate Mousse and (again, as i was told) "Calcutta's Best Tiramisu", which indeed lived up to its expectations. the coffee taste blended in mouth, perfect for a blissful end to a satisfying meal. 
However, it wasnt a PERFECT experience. The table where ni was seated had a direct, strong, tungsten light which fell on my head-owing to give me an unavoidable head ache. i wish they would decrese the strength of the light, and make it slightly tolerable. however, :) when i asked them to dim it, they very willingly did do so! :) lastly, one more avoidable mistake they made, was that the Veg Bruschetta had ICE COLD spiced tomatoes on it. i know that they werent suppose to be at a warm or room temperature, but maybe not straight-out-of-the-fridge cold! i had to wait for it to WARM UP a bit! :) but after that, it became perfect too! 
apart from these two avoidable unintentional mistakes, the place is one of the finest food joints in Calcutta, For sure! :)

Being one of my most favourite italian joints in kolkata, Serafina has never failed me.
Yes the pocket pinch is high but I still keep going back for the food.
The pizzas are amazing and i absolutely swear by the porcini ravioli. Highly recommended as an ideal place to go to for a date or even for a quiet dinner with family.

I got my chance to visit Serafina right after the Durga Pujas and was really looking forward to the same. When we arrived, we were offered the weekday lunch package which we opted for. For starters we had the 'Di Sofia' or the Chicken Caesar salad. While i liked the presentation and it being served the right way with croutons, but the dressing was way too much and made it drip and soggy and was a bit less on the chicken too. 
For our main course we were served the 'Tagliolini con Petti di Pollo' or the Chicken Pasta. It was really rich and delectable. Very creamy with chicken and mushroom in it and one of the finest white sauce pasta i had. Up next was 'Pizza Ala Norcina' which was a delight. I am a fan of wood burnt thin crust pizzas and its minced chicken and mushroom topping was amazing indeed. Just a small thing, even though individual dishes were great, the pizza and pasta tasted quite similar. As we deferred to the suggestions of the wait staff before the order they could have suggested us a good combination. However, as the dishes were amazing I will let that pass.
Last but not the least, desserts: 'Panacotta' and 'Tiramisu'. My friend loved the Panacotta so much i didn't get to properly taste it! The look on her face said that it was indeed amazing. As for the Tiramisu, the coffee flavoured dessert, they nailed it and what a way to wrap up a filling Italian lunch.
Ambiance is very warm and relaxed and the wait staff is courteous. Service was quick.

Other than yautcha this was the only joint in quest mall which I had yet to check in. So when my friends and I visited quest some time back, we decided to give this place a try. Well, I was really taken in with the ambience and the courteous staff. Coming to the food, they offer complimentary bread basket. We had ordered a pasta dish (which I have forgotten the name of, sorry for that) and chicken breast paillard. The food in themselves tasted really good, though I thought that the quantity could have been a bit more.

Well this was something! It was a pity that we had reached wee earlier than their evening hours, but we did have a splendid time.

The place is a resplendent one housed inside the premises of Quest Mall. It has an occidental sensation to itself which will unfailingly scheme to attract even the most notoriously inattentive passers by. I loved it, just!

We had a two course meal. So we ordered a nice, healthy and holistic salad made with greens, avocado, carrots etc. Next we ordered a potato dominant dish. The potatoes, sliced, we fried in olive and then transformed into something crunchy, spicey yet soft dish.

I place is lively. Yes the prices are a wee bit high given the fact that they most treat you to predominantly Italian cuisines.

But if you ask me, if and when you can, definitely make sure you explore this part of the world. Most likely you won't rue the decision

The fifth floor at quest mall is surely every foodies delight. it houses some of the best eateries in town with best experimental food, amazing service and a great ambience. We were at Irish house a couple of times and thought of checking this place.¬†

It was a Sunday evening when we decided to sit somewhere for dinner after the regular shopping stuff. staffs were courteous and will give you personalized attention. Very logical for the fact that they charge 10% Service charge on top of government taxes.. :D

Wine list is impressive but priced on a little higher side. other spirits are priced competitive. for the drinks i settled for Budweiser Beer and my Foodie friend had her regular diet coke. it was served chilled and repeats for the drinks were asked at appropriate times.¬†

we decided to skip the starters and ordered the pizza and a pasta for the main course. believe me folks, their thin crust pizzas were just amazing. undoubtedly the best pizza we ever had within kolkata. ( Dont remember the name tho. everything seems sooo complicated, and was a bit high) :D

pasta was average. might because of our expectation were high.. lol

P.s: Just in case menu looks fancy with no idea about what exactly they would be serving, Go by the servers recommendations. i personally liked all of it.

Had high expectations from this place but was extremely disappointed. The food is just not worth the high prices that they charge. Ordered Bruschetta which visually looked good but didn't taste at all good. There was just too much of raw tomatoes piled on the toasted bread. I've had much better elsewhere. The lasagne al forno was ok but not worth the high prices they charge.Once again I have to say I've had much better lasagne elsewhere. The lichee and ginger  mojito was refreshing as was the passion fruit ice tea. The service too was not up to the mark. Disappointed with the place.

We stopped at serafina on the way back from maddox for an early dinner but the portions served left a lot to be desired. Whether that was owing to our ravenous appetite  or not I m not sure but the braised chicken platter almost vanished before we could savour the taste. The chicken ravioli is a must try but I didn't care much for the pizzas. All in all like everything quest mall if you are looking for overhyped overpriced pretentious stuff it's the place for you

We had great expectations from serafina when we went as a large family gathering during pujo but left disappointed. .the average Italian fare which is not a patch on fire and ice ..serves over priced Italian fare by poorly trained staff who seem only interested inflating your bill ! The pasta lacks depth of flavour , the super expensive new Zealand lamb chops were under done and the prawns starters over fried ....the only redemption was the ginger lychee mock tail. ...for well travelled connoisseurs of Italian food ..serafina will leave with a bad taste in the mouth!

Wife asked me to take her to Quest Mall for shopping, location Lifestyle advised by
fashion designer daughter... Specifically, with brand names...

After 5 hours of shopping, wife said "I'm Thirsty"

I had a surprise in store for her.

I had heard of this Italian restaurant Serafina ...

Yauatcha(Chinese) will go some day later, Mexican?Italian?American HIGHLY OVER RATED, OVER CROWDED, OVER SNOBBISH & SNOOTY CHILLY'S
(have come out of Chilly's twice for long waiting period & out of turn table allotments) & Irish Pub, which I keep for stag parties were given a pass by & Kind of empty, relaxed & good ambiance Serafina was chosen...

It was my 29
th Wedding Anniversary after all...

It was a wise decision.

WHENEVER I GO OUT WITH WIFE Smartphone/Camera/Instagram is left at home, & pictures are WHATEVER SHE TAKES/PARTS WITH(Sorry NO FOODPORN) :P :xd

¬†Picture 1 Chef's special vanilla based dessert(complimentary when they realised that it was our anniversary) by Wife

Anniversary Dinner, Picture by Aloke Biswas Attendant

PS: This is worse half. Better half edited out by Better Half before WatsApp

Il Tiramisu is to die for...

Seriously Aloke & The staff are Sigma 6

Aloke took us to education on Italian Cuisine explaining in detail Mixing Balsamic Vinegar to Olive Oil

Explaining how Tiramisu is made, what went into Ravioli...

In the end there was an on the house dessert specially made for us by the Chef...''

The smile is a result of that...The service floored me''

It was Anniversary(They noticed from the feedback form my wife had filled)

That was quick job!!!

Service 5

Food, authenticity 5

Ambience 4.5

Staff 10/5(knowledgeable, courteous & assisting & educating)

Crowd Sparse

Hep Cool(to be seen) Factor 4(Good it is 4 here) compensated by great authentic Italian Cuisine

Over all 4.5

I Love French, Greek, Italian cuisine just for the reason that it brings out delicate flavor without it being suppressed by strong spices and extremely high amount of spice.

Now for the actual review.

We entered Serafina and were immediately attended by Maitre de Hote Aloke, asked for Water Plain or Mineral?

We chose normal.

Immediately I told Aloke We have NO CLUE ABOUT ITALIAN FOOD, and that he should guide us.

Drinks(just a starter 1 each)

I ordered for a Beer(Heineken & Morris were absent) Hence Budweiser. Rs. 250.00

Wife Ordered (lychie mojito) but on Aloke's tip chose Twisted Orange Mojito Rs. 175.00

(I took a sip of Mojito was awesome with mint & crushed ice) Wife's I'm Thirsty problem solved.

Salad

For Salad we ordered Melon Carpaccio(Musk Melon thinly sliced & placed on a plate with vanilla flavoured sugar syrup & Rocket leaves over it in the centre, seasoned with pure olive oil) Rs. 275.00

Main Course

Ravioli Ai Porcini(Ravioli filled with Porcini mushrooms & Spinach in Feta cheese) Tender flavor. Rs. 795.00

Tip from Aloke "Please do not add any chilli flakes or Oregano, just freshly ground black pepper"

Then brought complimentary bread, crisb toasted without oil.

In a small dish, added balsamic vinegar & virgin olive oil, then added some ground pepper, freshly ground & chilli flakes & asked us to dip bread in the Balsamic Vinaigrette & eat it. (Do any bistros do this education? Not to my knowledge)

While we were enjoying Ravioli & Bread alternating between soft flaavaoured Rivioli & pungent vinaigretted-bread combo, Aloke gave the next enlightenment.

Sir, you must try our Tiramisu, it is the best in Indiaa!!!

I raised one eyebrow & told Aloke "You're playing with fire, I shall send a decoy incognito Italian cuisine aficionado to rate it" Is'nt Tiramisu a Japanese or Korean Dish? What is it doing in an Italian Restaurant?

He did not scoff/bat an eyelid/laugh/or act like a bloated ego Maitre, but patiently explained, Sir, Tiramisu is an Italian Dessert, made of Vanilla flavoured Cream, sandwiched with sweetened Arabica Coffee The Coffee beans are authentic Arabica... Rs. 585

While we were enjoying Tiramisu(was yummmmmmmmmmmy) Aloke put the icing on the Cake. Sir, when you come next time, you must try our dessert, made out of Truffle.

Me: "Is'nt Truffle British? Comes in Bottle?"(Treacle)

Aloke: No Sir, Truffle is actually an underground fungus... It is pretty expensive. We import authentic Truffle, immediately shows me bottle...

How many maitre know their food & its ingredients this well? Not many at the most a handful in a metropolis of 13 million !!!

Meal was burrp...

Taste was delicate

The attendant was so knowledgeable that it was a pleasure talking to him.

Now the #pinchtopocket

Rs. 250+175+275+795+0+585=Rs. 2080

Taxes Sales Tax on Beer 27% Rs. 74.25

Service Charge 10% Rs. 208(This is the reason for great service at Serafina & Chai Break & Barista & The South Courtyard HENCE NO TIP WAS LEFT, donated Rs.10 towards Tata Cancer Hospital BY CARD!!!)

Service Tax @ 5.6% Rs. 128.13

VAT ON F&B @ 14.5% Rs. 291.89 (Total others Rs. 702.00

Total #PinchToPocket Rs. 2782(for 2 Rs 1391.00 per pax)

Money watcher stay at Food Court

OR Come on weekdays daytime they have affordable Rs. 699.00 Menu

PS: The Place has great stock of Authentic imported wine. Wine list is exhaustive, goes upto champagne. Some Rs 4000.00/Bottle.

Placed horizontaly in shelves, like it should be.

Observation: All guests looked fit & none were unusually obese(Meaning health conscious)

Food is healthy & nutritious. Olive oil is healthy.

Unlike outside in food court or other bistros. YES MY EYE DOES NOT ANY SUCH DETAIL...

Sorry this is lengthy, but hey , the guys made my anniversary a night to remember, as well as educated me the fine nuances of Italian Cuisine...

For which they deserved & earned this review

check my DP & #kolkatafoodietrail on instagram. I am not THAT ignoramus on food...

In childhood, home was full of Perry Mason, Louise L'Amour, Agatha Christie, Enid Blyton & Ian Fleming..

AND Women's Weekly

so knowledge about cooking , food & 'how to poison' was learnt at 10. And cooked my 1st breakfast at 11, Gajar Ka Halwa at 14 & Parippu Pradaman at 16....

I know my stuff.

Decent Italian ..... my place of choice in Calcutta ..... their risottos are very decent ..... by now i have tried almost all of them ..... one of my favourite pizzas is the one with parma ham on it. They make a decent margarita as well. Also the truffle pizza is quite a delight. They almost get most of the things right. The wine is served perfectly well ..... the temperature of the wines and the glasses maintained. The tiramisu is good too .... the only restaurant outside five stars that serve a good tiramisu. 

I never tire of going to this place.

I had my eyes on this place for quite some time and finally decided to give my b'day treat here. Situated on the 5th floor of quest mall this place is surely a winner when italian cuisine is concerned. Though it was just 3 of us, we made our reservations earlier and hence got seated immediately( although it was almost empty). The ambience of this place is nice, the ornamentation and decor was quite stylish though nothing extraordinary. The staff were courteous and friendly. The food was outstanding too. We went for the set meal which comprised of an appetizer,a main course and a dessert along with a complimentary glass of wine. The set meal also had a very interesting choice of food and we decided on the meal impromptu. For the appetizers we ordered 2 chicken ceaser salad which tasted very light and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The dish also comprised of crouttons which i personally enjoyed a lot. The soup ordered was also tasty having  hot n light feel to it and supplemented with ample amount of veggies, mainly zucchini,potato and carrots. For the main course we ordered two pizzas and a pasta(the names were a bit complicated to remeber). The non veg pizza was the showstealer. The thin crust with the perfect amount of crispiness and ample cheese and meat made the taste buds superhappy. The same feelings go for the pasta too. It was cooked beautifully with a delicious creamy texture and ample chicken. The only letdown was the veg pizza. We ordered it in the first place as it was considered a 'legend dish' of the place but neither of us enjoyed it. Though the crust of the pizza and the cheesy layer was good the rest of it was bland. For the dessert we had tiramisu and panacotta. The tiramisu was one of the best i ever tasted till date however the panacotta was a bit disappointing. It had a sour taste to it which i did not enjoy. However,apart from two little glitches everything about serafina was perfect. Another great pro of the place was their service which was exellent and very quick.Our meal came for 800 plus taxes for one,but it was justified considering the quality of the food. Really had a nice time and looking forward to visit the place again.

My friend decided to give her birthday treat in serafina so we made a reservation for lunch today. The place is neatly decorated and a cosy one too but not that huge in size. We wanted to try out their set meal which was a good option considering the fact that it includes 1 salad/soup, 1 main course, 1 desert and also a glass of complimentary red or white wine. As our group consisted of 3 we chose 2 chicken ceasar salad and 1 minestrone soup. The ceasar salad was really well prepared and the dressing was a balanced one as it was not overpowering the other ingredients and my friend liked the texture of the croutons which were amply given in the dish. The minestrone soup was quite refreshing in taste, it was light on stomach and had pieces of carrots,potato,zucchini in it. In main course we ordered the chicken fettuccine pasta, 1 veg pizza and 1 non veg pizza (sorry don't know the exact names). The non veg pizza and the pasta were outstanding which made me fall in love with both the dishes . The pasta had a perfect amount of creamy texture and was filled with mushrooms and the pizza was absolutely thin in crust with a slight crunch, ample cheese,mushrooms and meat. The disappointment was the veg pizza as It did not meet my expectation though in the menu it was written that it's a serafina legend. In dessert we took 2 tiramisu and 1 panacotta. The panacotta had a slight lemon flavour in it but was small in size and it made me sad cause it got over in a jiffy. The tiramisu was served in a good portion and was yum in taste. We were quite satisfied with the whole experience and most importantly the service was super fast and timed properly. I do agree that it is quite costly when compared to the portions of the dishes.

Overall experience was very good and the food was very well made. Could be a tad bit expensive but they carry the so called legacy of New York, so that's justified I guess. Good ambience, very good food and very good service. You can choose to sit inside or take the outside space like all other eateries in Quest. Not to forget, you get to click a snap on the yellow Vespa right outside the eatery :)

Wife asked me to take her to Quest Mall for shopping, location Lifestyle advised by
fashion designer daughter... Specifically, with brand names...

After 5 hours of shopping, wife said "I'm Thirsty"

I had a surprise in store for her.

I had heard of this Italian restaurant Serafina ...

Yauatcha(Chinese) will go some day later, Mexican?Italian?American HIGHLY OVER RATED, OVER CROWDED, OVER SNOBBISH & SNOOTY CHILLY'S
(have come out of Chilly's twice for long waiting period & out of turn table allotments) & Irish Pub, which I keep for stag parties were given a pass by & Kind of empty, relaxed & good ambiance Serafina was chosen...

It was my 29
th Wedding Anniversary after all...

It was a wise decision.

WHENEVER I GO OUT WITH WIFE Smartphone/Camera/Instagram is left at home, & pictures are WHATEVER SHE TAKES/PARTS WITH(Sorry NO FOODPORN) :P :xd

¬†Picture 1 Chef's special vanilla based dessert(complimentary when they realised that it was our anniversary) by Wife

Anniversary Dinner, Picture by Aloke Biswas Attendant

PS: This is worse half. Better half edited out by Better Half before WatsApp

Il Tiramisu is to die for...

Seriously Aloke & The staff are Sigma 6

Aloke took us to education on Italian Cuisine explaining in detail Mixing Balsamic Vinegar to Olive Oil

Explaining how Tiramisu is made, what went into Ravioli...

In the end there was an on the house dessert specially made for us by the Chef...''

The smile is a result of that...The service floored me''

It was Anniversary(They noticed from the feedback form my wife had filled)

That was quick job!!!

Service 5

Food, authenticity 5

Ambience 4.5

Staff 10/5(knowledgeable, courteous & assisting & educating)

Crowd Sparse

Hep Cool(to be seen) Factor 4(Good it is 4 here) compensated by great authentic Italian Cuisine

Over all 4.5

I Love French, Greek, Italian cuisine just for the reason that it brings out delicate flavor without it being suppressed by strong spices and extremely high amount of spice.

Now for the actual review.

We entered Serafina and were immediately attended by Maitre de Hote Aloke, asked for Water Plain or Mineral?

We chose normal.

Immediately I told Aloke We have NO CLUE ABOUT ITALIAN FOOD, and that he should guide us.

Drinks(just a starter 1 each)

I ordered for a Beer(Heineken & Morris were absent) Hence Budweiser. Rs. 250.00

Wife Ordered (lychie mojito) but on Aloke's tip chose Twisted Orange Mojito Rs. 175.00

(I took a sip of Mojito was awesome with mint & crushed ice) Wife's I'm Thirsty problem solved.

Salad

For Salad we ordered Melon Carpaccio(Musk Melon thinly sliced & placed on a plate with vanilla flavoured sugar syrup & Rocket leaves over it in the centre, seasoned with pure olive oil) Rs. 275.00

Main Course

Ravioli Ai Porcini(Ravioli filled with Porcini mushrooms & Spinach in Feta cheese) Tender flavor. Rs. 795.00

Tip from Aloke "Please do not add any chilli flakes or Oregano, just freshly ground black pepper"

Then brought complimentary bread, crisb toasted without oil.

In a small dish, added balsamic vinegar & virgin olive oil, then added some ground pepper, freshly ground & chilli flakes & asked us to dip bread in the Balsamic Vinaigrette & eat it. (Do any bistros do this education? Not to my knowledge)

While we were enjoying Ravioli & Bread alternating between soft flaavaoured Rivioli & pungent vinaigretted-bread combo, Aloke gave the next enlightenment.

Sir, you must try our Tiramisu, it is the best in Indiaa!!!

I raised one eyebrow & told Aloke "You're playing with fire, I shall send a decoy incognito Italian cuisine aficionado to rate it" Is'nt Tiramisu a Japanese or Korean Dish? What is it doing in an Italian Restaurant?

He did not scoff/bat an eyelid/laugh/or act like a bloated ego Maitre, but patiently explained, Sir, Tiramisu is an Italian Dessert, made of Vanilla flavoured Cream, sandwiched with sweetened Arabica Coffee The Coffee beans are authentic Arabica... Rs. 585

While we were enjoying Tiramisu(was yummmmmmmmmmmy) Aloke put the icing on the Cake. Sir, when you come next time, you must try our dessert, made out of Truffle.

Me: "Is'nt Truffle British? Comes in Bottle?"(Treacle)

Aloke: No Sir, Truffle is actually an underground fungus... It is pretty expensive. We import authentic Truffle, immediately shows me bottle...

How many maitre know their food & its ingredients this well? Not many at the most a handful in a metropolis of 13 million !!!

Meal was burrp...

Taste was delicate

The attendant was so knowledgeable that it was a pleasure talking to him.

Now the #pinchtopocket

Rs. 250+175+275+795+0+585=Rs. 2080

Taxes Sales Tax on Beer 27% Rs. 74.25

Service Charge 10% Rs. 208(This is the reason for great service at Serafina & Chai Break & Barista & The South Courtyard HENCE NO TIP WAS LEFT, donated Rs.10 towards Tata Cancer Hospital BY CARD!!!)

Service Tax @ 5.6% Rs. 128.13

VAT ON F&B @ 14.5% Rs. 291.89 (Total others Rs. 702.00

Total #PinchToPocket Rs. 2782(for 2 Rs 1391.00 per pax)

Money watcher stay at Food Court

OR Come on weekdays daytime they have affordable Rs. 699.00 Menu

PS: The Place has great stock of Authentic imported wine. Wine list is exhaustive, goes upto champagne. Some Rs 4000.00/Bottle.

Placed horizontaly in shelves, like it should be.

Observation: All guests looked fit & none were unusually obese(Meaning health conscious)

Food is healthy & nutritious. Olive oil is healthy.

Unlike outside in food court or other bistros. YES MY EYE DOES NOT ANY SUCH DETAIL...

Sorry this is lengthy, but hey , the guys made my anniversary a night to remember, as well as educated me the fine nuances of Italian Cuisine...

For which they deserved & earned this review

check my DP & #kolkatafoodietrail on instagram. I am not THAT ignoramus on food...

In childhood, home was full of Perry Mason, Louise L'Amour, Agatha Christie, Enid Blyton & Ian Fleming..

AND Women's Weekly

so knowledge about cooking , food & 'how to poison' was learnt at 10. And cooked my 1st breakfast at 11, Gajar Ka Halwa at 14 & Parippu Pradaman at 16....

Decent Italian ..... my place of choice in Calcutta ..... their risottos are very decent ..... by now i have tried almost all of them ..... one of my favourite pizzas is the one with parma ham on it. They make a decent margarita as well. Also the truffle pizza is quite a delight. They almost get most of the things right. The wine is served perfectly well ..... the temperature of the wines and the glasses maintained. The tiramisu is good too .... the only restaurant outside five stars that serve a good tiramisu. 

I never tire of going to this place.

I had my eyes on this place for quite some time and finally decided to give my b'day treat here. Situated on the 5th floor of quest mall this place is surely a winner when italian cuisine is concerned. Though it was just 3 of us, we made our reservations earlier and hence got seated immediately( although it was almost empty). The ambience of this place is nice, the ornamentation and decor was quite stylish though nothing extraordinary. The staff were courteous and friendly. The food was outstanding too. We went for the set meal which comprised of an appetizer,a main course and a dessert along with a complimentary glass of wine. The set meal also had a very interesting choice of food and we decided on the meal impromptu. For the appetizers we ordered 2 chicken ceaser salad which tasted very light and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The dish also comprised of crouttons which i personally enjoyed a lot. The soup ordered was also tasty having  hot n light feel to it and supplemented with ample amount of veggies, mainly zucchini,potato and carrots. For the main course we ordered two pizzas and a pasta(the names were a bit complicated to remeber). The non veg pizza was the showstealer. The thin crust with the perfect amount of crispiness and ample cheese and meat made the taste buds superhappy. The same feelings go for the pasta too. It was cooked beautifully with a delicious creamy texture and ample chicken. The only letdown was the veg pizza. We ordered it in the first place as it was considered a 'legend dish' of the place but neither of us enjoyed it. Though the crust of the pizza and the cheesy layer was good the rest of it was bland. For the dessert we had tiramisu and panacotta. The tiramisu was one of the best i ever tasted till date however the panacotta was a bit disappointing. It had a sour taste to it which i did not enjoy. However,apart from two little glitches everything about serafina was perfect. Another great pro of the place was their service which was exellent and very quick.Our meal came for 800 plus taxes for one,but it was justified considering the quality of the food. Really had a nice time and looking forward to visit the place again.

My friend decided to give her birthday treat in serafina so we made a reservation for lunch today. The place is neatly decorated and a cosy one too but not that huge in size. We wanted to try out their set meal which was a good option considering the fact that it includes 1 salad/soup, 1 main course, 1 desert and also a glass of complimentary red or white wine. As our group consisted of 3 we chose 2 chicken ceasar salad and 1 minestrone soup. The ceasar salad was really well prepared and the dressing was a balanced one as it was not overpowering the other ingredients and my friend liked the texture of the croutons which were amply given in the dish. The minestrone soup was quite refreshing in taste, it was light on stomach and had pieces of carrots,potato,zucchini in it. In main course we ordered the chicken fettuccine pasta, 1 veg pizza and 1 non veg pizza (sorry don't know the exact names). The non veg pizza and the pasta were outstanding which made me fall in love with both the dishes . The pasta had a perfect amount of creamy texture and was filled with mushrooms and the pizza was absolutely thin in crust with a slight crunch, ample cheese,mushrooms and meat. The disappointment was the veg pizza as It did not meet my expectation though in the menu it was written that it's a serafina legend. In dessert we took 2 tiramisu and 1 panacotta. The panacotta had a slight lemon flavour in it but was small in size and it made me sad cause it got over in a jiffy. The tiramisu was served in a good portion and was yum in taste. We were quite satisfied with the whole experience and most importantly the service was super fast and timed properly. I do agree that it is quite costly when compared to the portions of the dishes.

Overall experience was very good and the food was very well made. Could be a tad bit expensive but they carry the so called legacy of New York, so that's justified I guess. Good ambience, very good food and very good service. You can choose to sit inside or take the outside space like all other eateries in Quest. Not to forget, you get to click a snap on the yellow Vespa right outside the eatery :)

Amazing food and service. Have tried almost all food items.Plenty of vegetarian options. Have literally tried all the drinks (non alcoholic). The D'Chopra salad is to die for, the goats cheese salad is not so good (just because I personally don't like sweet salads with so much of cheese). The ravioli, risotto and pizza is amazing.Have come here 3 times in to days. Once for dinner twice for lunch. Little expensive but worth it. Nice tiramisu. All the moctails are splendid.

If you are looking for authentic italian fare and are not worried about spending more then this is the place to be. It has amazing food but is an expensive place. They have a set menu for lunch on weekends which ia pocket friendly. The dish that I loved the most was the porcini mushroom risotto. The portions here are a little small but the pizzas are amazing. A good place to dine out for special dates and celebrations. I would definitely go back.

One of the best Italian joints in the city, if not the best after La Cucina. You can easily rate the Italian as very authentic.

The soup of the day had a mocha flavor which was quite interesting. The Crostini was delectable.

The pasta selection is absolutely fantastic, we tried the Bolognese and the Limoncello. Both were prepared with full-some flavors.

The Pizza menu is varied and offers a wide choice, The ones with Rabiola cheese is a great dish.

To top it all finish off with the Tiramisu. They probably make the best one in the city!!!!

The staff is extremely courteous and service is of very good standard.

Lovely place with a very nice ambiance on the inside. The food is a extremely similar to proper Italian cuisine which might deter people since most are used to the indianized form. Their prosciutto is the best in Calcutta so far and their salads are very different and extremely fresh. Their prawns are also always very fresh and perfectly cooked in whatever dish. All in all. The closest to authentic Italian cuisine that you would find in Calcutta. The service is also very good. And the waiters are rather nice and courteous, and chef Anand knows exactly how I like my pizza, me being extremely fussy about things. The staff don't mind the fussiness which is very sweet of them. 
Also the tiramisu is out of this world!

Very good food, excellent ambience and par excellent service is the common feedback that we have received from our customers. And now, the moment somebody says Kolkata and Fine Dining in the same breath, our quick response is Serafina :-)

Had been to serafina yesterday. The ambience is nice, the waiters are courteous and the food excellent. We had ordered tomato soup, pasta in white sauce with prawn and lemon zest and a tomato, mozzarella, anchovy and caper pizza. Everything tasted wonderful, especially the pasta. The subtle hint of lemon zest, the perfectly cooked prawns and a dash of olive oil, made it absolutely outstanding. However the portions are bit smaller as compared to the price. Wonderful experience, would love to visit again.

Serafina is an Italian cum Continental resto serving a wide variety of pastas and pizzas. It offered a mixture of a some good tasty items and some not that good. We had some Bruschetas to start off with. It was nothing but toasted bread with jus some cold tomatoes on top of it. The complimentary bread basket was not that good as well with the breads being a little hard and there was no butter or dips to go along with it. The chillers were pretty good to have, especially the litchi drink. What we enjoyed the most was the thin crust classic Italian pizzas with very good bake of cheese and chicken alongwith some extra toppings of vegetables like bell pepper. A chicken side dish spicy fried chicken was good as well. Serafina can be tried out if you want to have some good fresh pizzas for lunch and are not too much concerned regarding the price.

True Fine fine Italian food in Kolkata 

Finally someone got their thin crust pizza right.  Today everyone is making a hand tossed pizza , but it's an art rather than just to serve. 

This place makes amazing pizzas. 
We were two people and could not finish one pasta and pizza. The quality of cheese used is good. 

The staff is very polite. Loves the whole experience. 

When this place was launched it was rumored the place is so expensive that one cannot fill their stomach 
But this is not true. The pocket pinch is not that high, if ordered properly.

After running away from the loud obnoxious music at Irish House, we ducked into Serafina for drinks. We ordered a bloody Mary and a ginger basil mojito. Very yummy indeed. We also ate a lovely thin crust margherita pizza with thinly sliced bacon. The only dark cloud over a great experience was the bill which went from 1300 to 1800 simply because of the taxes.

My first visit to Serafina ~ a special occasion ¬†being a dear friend's birthday, a friend who lives overseas and doesn't give us a chance to celebrate her birthday with her too often.¬†
In retrospect, Serafina was a great choice, with its laid back quiet coziness; muted conversations buzzing at some tables over lunch; pleasant wait staff who explained patiently, that Serafina meant 'wings of the angel' which had us proceed to roll the word on our tongues, in anticipation of the food that we were about to order!
Crisp fried prawns to start with, with a glass of house white, followed by Chopra Salad (???!!) ¬†- Lovely crisp greens in Lemon vinaigrette, with walnuts; ¬†& Sofia Salad - chicken strips in a Caesar salad;¬†
Main Courses were Tagliolini - luscious chicken & baby peas in a bit of cream; a delicious Spaghetti Al Pacino (heh heh!) - can't go wrong with red pepper & garlic - and Pizza Norcina - crisp, light, but a trifle boring!¬†
If you have a sweet tooth, then you must try their Tiramisu which was moist and light; the Panacotta was smooth & the cheesecake a little too strongly flavored with essence of mango

I would say, this place is worth a visit!

If you're planning to visit this place, do be sure that you're indeed in a mood to splurge. A decent Ristorante! Try the Ravioli Al Tartufo Nero and you won't be disappointed at all :) Do make it a point to note that this place takes its stuff seriously! Somewhat rare when you dine in Kolkata (sorry for sounding biased). The filet mignon was done to perfection and this is when you say "Hail Serafina"!! Go ahead, bring your folks who enjoy experimenting with cuisines and ensure you leave those at home who don't!

It was a first visit to Serafina. The ambience, the lightings are pretty good and gives you a luxurious treatment. The service is prompt. The staff sticks to the timeline.

However, it was the food that did not leave us with a heavenly or a fulfilling experience. Pretty ordinary and priced higher than the standards. Did not find the Ravioli too delicious. Though Italian, I suppose I could have it better someplace else. Recommend it for the ambience, but not for the food and its price.

I went to serafina last night with my husband with great excitement,but the place was smelling of non-vegetarian food badly. Being vegetarians we requested the waiter to spray a room freshner but he shifted us to a new table where the smell was equally prominent.We started our dinner by ordering a D.Chopra Salad,the ingredients of which sounded exotic,like leafy greens,caramalised walnuts,asparagus,cherry tomatoes,caramalised corns etc.. But when the salad was served all it had was "leafy greens"(lettuce) We couldnt spot a single piece of the exotic ingredients and even after requesting for a change in the salad we were served really below average salad that costed us 500 rs,too much to pay for lettuce and a stinking atmosphere!

Had been to this place on a friends bday and had to leave the place with an awful experience. The food was so bad that we had to leave in between and go to another restaurant. The bruschetta that we had ordered along with raviolli was simply frozen and diced tomatoes served on rusk, ya it was that bad. Even the waiters were not very courteous, so an absolute no when it comes to suggesting this place to anyone.

I have tasted better pizza here, than in Italy itself. The pizza is light, thin crusted, and very simple. The art of good pizza is when the crust is thin and topping is kept simple. We ordered two plain margherita with toppings of marinated chicken, bacon and prawn. The flavours were intact, the crust was thin and the topping was handled with care. Along with pizza came a chilly oil which was again a winner.For starters we got calamari and mushroom cappucino. The calamari was very palatable because of the anchovy sauce that was served with it. The mushroom cappucino was creamy and the consistency very much kept in mind. Lastly I tried out their signature dessert, Tiramisu. The cake layers were moist, and flavourful and the cream was consistent and light. The slice sufficed two people or even more. The lunch was not only fulfilling but also a worthy experience. It is worth spending so much money because not everyday do we get to eat such great food.

Serafina is an Italian eatery from New york. They serve authentic Italian Pizza, Pasta & other dishes.
The menu isn't very extensive with few options for vegetarians; however, what they offer, they make well.
A must try for anyone is the Goat's cheese salad. The pizza's were made to perfection as was the pasta we ordered.¬†
It is a bit expensive but then again what self proclaimed fine dining restaurant isn't. The one thing that they could improve on are the portion sizes. They don't do justice to the price even considering the fine dining tag attached.

All in all, a good choice for Italian food in Calcutta.

The place gives a very good feel when you enter.. On a Saturday afternoon the place was empty but still the service was pretty slow.. We ordered everything at one go still took about 50 mins for the main course to arrive..

Coming to the food. The soup was very good. The grilled veggie was also very well flavoured.. The main course which consisted of ravioli was ok but the primavera risotto was very bad.. There are many places in calcutta which serve much better risotto and for a way better price..

The ice tea was also very very bad even inspite of changing it once.

As it is said that you have to wait for the best things to come.. Everything was forgotten after having the tiramisu which was superb the best I have had..

The price is obviously high considering the service tax charge and VAT.

All in all love the dessert.

We went in for a late night dinner after having a drinks night out, we were the only ones in the place and got the undivided attention of all the staff. We ordered a Crespelle Di Sofia- Crepes, the dish just melted in my mouth, would rank it among the best food I have had. Next item was Chicken Breast Paillard which was a so ‚Äìso dish, normally would call it decent but was disappointed as my expectations were high after the Crespelle. 

One of the reasons we had gone to the place was because of the rave reviews about its Tiramisu and I was not disappointed. Hands down the best Tiramisu I have had in the world. It was so yum ended up having another, will make it a point to visit the place again just to have it.

As for the price‚Äôs it‚Äôs on the expensive side considering the quantity are small. Most of the dishes are about 600 bucks, so a three course meal will pinch you about 2k without alcohol.

This place truly gives out a quintessential Italian vibe, complete with European music and the Vespa displayed outside. As for the food and beverages, they have a wonderful stock European wine. Being a wine lover, discovering the Portugal Ros√® Wine was sheer bliss. We ordered French Fries, Chicken Arrabiata and Pizza Bianca. The pizza was lovely and the cheese absolutely smooth. For dessert we ordered Tiramisu and reached the seventh heaven. They undoubtedly make the best Tiramisu in town and it id an absolute must-try.
Pocket Pinch : A complete meal would cost you around 1500 INR without alcohol. Sadly, most of it goes away in taxes.  But this place is a value for money with the quality of food and the ambience. 
Their service is extremely efficient.

Serafina is an amazing restaurant for Italian food. The must tries are:Al Porcini which is a white sauce based pizza with porcini which is Italian mushroom and ravioli(any of them).It is a bit pricey but I personally feel that it's good for its price. I suggest making a reservation if you're going there especially on weekends.

We ordered:
Minestrone - top notch hearty soup
Simple tomato basil bruscheta - hearty tasting
Deepak chopra salad - absolutely loved it
Pizza with black olives having pits - really loved it

My second time there was a disappointment, the waiters were not helpful and misgudied, etc.. I made a big mistake, i should have sent the D.Chopra salad back, it was at room temperature. A big NO. That should be a chill salad which brings out its freshness. And yeah, i really hated that last christmas george michael and other dated ballads playing there.

Cons: the wait staff is useless, and cant explain the dish AT ALL and give wrong answers and misguide. The restaurant must do something about it. Like perhaps give a cleared written explanation of the dish so that customer is not dependent on wait staff for explanation. 

I'll cautiously try again. But the quality should match what I had the first time round.

I went there after some shopping at quest. Reached about 3:45pm and the waiters initially refused to allow seating inside as that area is closed after 4pm. Eventually they let us in. I ordered an appetizer, salad and pizza. I had read in all reviews about good service here but my experience was very average. Food was a big let down as the whole trip eventually comes down to it. The salad was the worst I had ever eaten. No balance of flavor,  the dressing was bad. I wish they had simply added olive oil and vinaigrette. ..as that would have been good. The appetizer was nothing great. The pizza was crisp and cheesy. But there was no visible chicken in my chicken pizza!  I will not return to this place. We have way better options available if u want to spend this much.

Finally visited serafina after hearing lots of mixed reviews. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. The orange mojito was very nice. The Caesar salad and tomato basil focaccia was average. But the pizzas and chicken slider were excellent. Though the portion of the slider was minuscule!! The pasta was also delightful.
Now really wanna try the tiramisu!

This is another member of Quest Mall's enviable collection of fine dining restaurants, and certainly one of the better Italian places in town. One thing I would recommend everyone orders is the thin crust pizza, which is the among the best I have had anywhere in the country. We ordered the pizza with prosciutto, parmesan cheese and egg and it was delicious. The prosciutto melts in your mouth and the cheese is just the right amount. A light delicious pizza that does not make you feel like this meal will be your last on this earth. The mains, while good, are not exceptional, especially considering the price. We had the tagliolini pasta and the filet mignon. Nothing wrong with either, pasta was in a creamy white sauce and not too heavy and the filet was tender and juicy. However, nothing you wouldn't get in a number of other restaurants. For dessert, we ordered the baked ricotta cheesecake, which while interesting, was a little too unlike cheesecake and too much like pudding for my taste.¬†

In conclusion, this is a place definitely worth checking out, if nothing else, for the truly exceptional pizza and the New York pizzeria ambience. The other dishes are also quite good, although you should be prepared to spend somewhere between 1.5 to 2 grand per head for a full meal.

Although I'm not that fond of Italian cuisine, I visited Serafina with one of my close friends sometime back. The best features about this place is its elegant interiors and the service but it stops there.

The food tasted average and charged way too high compared to other authentic Italian joints in town. That came to be the biggest turnoff about this place. If you have money to spend and looking for a nice place to sit, this might be the place you can visit. I'd recommend people to look for other options before settling in at Serafina.

Perfect place if you are in mood for some Italian. The truffle pizza is a must try. Other dishes are also well prepared and you can't go wrong with tiramisu. Overall the decor is not that appealing but you won't mind as the slow background music helps you focus on the food. This place is sure to leave some nice memories and a big whole in your wallet.

I would have given 5 for just the ambience. 
The food is very expensive and frankly speaking both the pastas we had ordered tasted pretty much the same.
Though the quantity is pretty good.
The appetiser "spiced chicken in arabiatta sauce" was pretty good. 
The tax they place on the bill is something more than the anticipated 10% and had me in a spot for a while.

a good place with good food but it comes with a huge price tag.
we tried only 3 items bruschetta , pesto pizza and tiramisu. the tiramisu was like a holy grail,  it was the best tirasmisu i ever had . pizza was also good,  but nothing great. the only disapponting about this place is there price tag. the service is also good, the staff always takes care if you need anything in between.

A friend and I visited this place for lunch. The ambience is extremely warm and welcoming with the not too bright yellow golden lights. A very clean and neat place. We just ordered for one dish because we were not too hungry. We ordered a pizza with tomato, fresh garden herbs, olives and parmigiano. The pizza tasted brilliant and was a treat to eat. The service was really good too. The price for the food is worth it. Definitely a must try!

Well, after much thinking we decided to try serafina, and we weren't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and efficient, they were willing to customize all our dishes, and the food was also great. The pasta, the risotto everything was delicious. I would love to visit again!

Was a bit vary before my visit to serafina but I must say, was extremely delighted by the food served !!

Located in quest, it's a bit pricey, pretty much on lines of corner courtyard etc. The decor is simple and nice. Seating area is well spaced out and comfortable. The staff service is decent and people are warm. The menu is pretty elaborate and gives you plenty of options.

Coming to food, tried the goat cheese salad which was okkayish but could be great if you customise the ingredients to your liking. Bruscetta was nice. But I was completely bowled over by the mains comprising of truffle pizza, ravioli al porcini, spaghetti alio olio. However found their penne primevera, leggerra pizza overly tangy for my taste. The tiramisu was exceptional and undoubtedly the best I have ever had. 

Overall, I loved my meal here and looking forward to try out their other dishes.

Stopped over for a quick dinner after a movie. 
Ordered a thin crust pepperoni, but apparently it was not part of the standard menu. Got a plain margherita pizza with five pieces of pepperoni stuck on top and got charged a nice 250 bucks for those five pieces on top of the exuberantly priced margherita.
Waiters need a bit of grooming and refining.
My table also got changed midway because a bigger group had arrived, seriously???
To sum it up, they need to pull up their socks if they want to stand a chance in front of the likes of chillis and yauatcha.

Serafina is one of the best Italian eateries in the city. The New York's famous chain serves one of a kind finest Italian food. I don't exactly remember the names. We had a dish of fried prawns, and a bow tie pasta with lamb. Both were superb. And for desserts, I had Tiramisu. Oh no! They serve the best Tiramisu in Kolkata. I still can't get over it. That's the best thing in Serafina. The decor is classy, elegant on one side and the yellow scooter kept outside adds a touch of quirkiness to it. The food is really good, staffs are pretty courteous. You will love it. Go there and surely have the Tiramisu. Happy Dining! :)

My first and only visit to this restaurant has been courtesy the restaurant itself, being invited to try out the delicacies they have on offer. Though a regular visitor at the Quest Mall, and having hard tried out almost every food outlet here, I had given Serafina the skip, partly put off by what is marked out as Rs 3000 as price for a meal for two. The good news is that it is not really that expensive, if you choose wisely. They also have reasonably priced fixed meals on offer for weekday lunches.

The entrance as well as the interiors are nothing terribly exciting. In fact the bland ceilings and the rather neutral surroundings help you focus on the food.

We had a huge variety on taste. Starters served were Carpacio Di Filetto Con Salsa Di Tartufi (thinly sliced filet mignon with truffle sauce and potato. Rather nice but difficult to pick up)
,¬†Bruschetta (not among my favourites),¬†Calamari (very nice, very crispy thoroughly enjoyed it, and asked for more :).

The came the Goat Cheese Salad, sweet to taste because it had apples, walnuts, honey. I loved the taste though some did not appreciate it quite that much.

We were served two pizzas. The Truffle Pizza (yummy... do not miss this one) and the Leggera Pizza (not even close to the former). The pizzas are wood-fired, adding to the taste. After them came a few varieties of pasta / rissoto, which I skipped, since I am not terribly fond of pastas.

The Bassa Al Pinot Grigo (grilled fish filet served on a bed of zucchini and leeks) was a real treat. I found the fish delicious, but its flavour did get somewhat lost in the rather strong flavour of the leeks. But worth a try nevertheless.¬†

The New Zealand Baby Lamp Chops (flavoured with rosemary and garlic) were a delight. Succulent, and done ever so nicely. Another must have.

Chicken Breast Pilliard was chciken breast hammered thin, grilled and served with arugular and tomato. Would have tasted great if were not almost full ten times over!!! I would have liked the chicken grilled from both sides perhaps.

Desser was Panna Cotta, light and delicious. Their speciality the Tiramisu was a real surprise. Honestly I have never been too fond of it, and this changed my mind completely. It was light and superbly done. None of the strong bitter flavours experienced elsewhere. A must try.

Ended with a cup of coffee and cream. A super lunch, spent well with good friends and good food, well curated by Serafina's excellent chef. Only later I realised we spent almost 4 hours!

Before I forget, yes were were also served drinks (I forget what I had, but one I clearly recall had an orange flavour to it. All good.

The service was initially lacking. The initial welcome at the entrance was not the warmest - I was the first to reach. Things changed for the better shortly. Also I found some of the staff not in tune to the fare the restaurant serves. The air-conditioning too kept going low on its own and we had to ask for it to be raised on more than one occasion.

I would be happy to recommend Serafina. Please do visit.

After months of convincing, I managed to drag a couple of friends to this restaurant. And what a treat it was. It is like nothing I have ever had before in India. Though the costs might run a little high, I would recommend this place to everyone. It truly is a New York style pizza place.

We had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which I felt was cooked well and the slight untidiness of the pasta showed that it was hand made, which I loved. We also had the gnocchi with cherry tomatoes. Though the gnocchi was not the best I have had, it was amazing. We also had the hand made Fettuccini in a tomato based sauce with cream. That was also quite good. However, what hit the ball out of the park for me, was the pizza. It looked like those large cartoon sized slices that droop at the end because they are so soft. Though professional, the food tasted very homely. A deadly combination not many places have mastered.

We had mocktails as well. All the mojitos were good and they were kind enough to get us something off the menu.

The service was fast and polite. Thumbs up to the staff as well.

Serafina boasts of great food with a good ambience, although the prices are higher end. Really loved the pizza I ordered -thin crust margherita with pickled olives and veggie toppings. That along with a portion of yummy french fries (a very sizeable portion, I must say) was more than enough for two. The cocktails are really good too. Didn't get a chance to try the desserts. Looking forward to the next time!

Serafina, located at quest mall is an icon in itself. As you walk into it you delve into a classy ambience and soothing environment. The dim lights add on to its elegance. Ok now talking about food we ordered zupa del griono as an appetiser, it's a soup which has tomatoes, olives, zucchini, potatoes, mushrooms and if you are a non- veg lover like me u can tell them to add chicken chunks to it.. And talking about pizzas here are cooked in African style, hand made dough made of pure flour and the pizzas here are made of thin crust. Even the toppings was well made. I will recommend to have pastas here than pizzas. As the pizzas will never fill your tummy. But nevertheless service was good and the lemonade was also a worth try.

Every since I heard that a wood stone oven has arrived in kolkata, I was very excited to try the pizzas that came out of it. However I wasn't entirely satisfied with the results. The pizzas were overly crisp, almost biscuit like n super crumbly. I've had wood stone oven made pizzas in London and the ones at Serafina are nothing like them. They weren't too bad though. 
The gnocchi and ravioli were very delicious. Perfectly cooked pasta with the perfect amount of sauce. They made up for the shortcomings of the pizza to a great extent.

This restaurant belongs to the mid to high range restaurants that have opened in the past year in Kolkata. If you want to splurge on European or Mediterranean food, you should check out this place. The Lamb Chop is to die for and one of the most expensive dishes on the menu. Their pastas are good, too (I had the Spaghetti Carbonara, which is a white sauce-based spaghetti offering with bacon). Each dish serves one person and the portions are filling. One must also try their desserts. The tiramisu specially is pretty good. The service is very good apart from the fact that the servers try to sell their menu a little too hard.

A lovely Bistro like setting... I recommend the outside seating... The food was amazing... Especially the chef's special menu... We tried the Arabita Spiced Chicken, Calamari with a homemade dip which marries tomato based salsa with Italian herb... For mains we tried Involtini Di Pollo... Chicken made in a roll stuffed with cheese and spinach, grilled to perfection... Served with a side of char grilled veggies and creamy mashed potatoes.... The dessert surpassed all expectations... The tiramisu is by far the best tiramisu in town... Panacotta with pure vanilla and the perfect creamy consistency were amazing... It is high priced for sure... But it is worth it.... Especially once in a while... ;)

April 2016:
This Instalment of serafina was with my bestie.... Having similar taste in food.... She is one of the people I love eating out with.... We ordered Calamari with their homemade tomato and basil sauce and Pizza Ala Norsica.... The pizza was a white one... One of my favourites.... With mozzarella cheese, mushroom and chicken ....it was simply heavenly... We wanted to have the tiramisu or the ricotta cheese cake... Alas they were not available... So we had one of my favourites again... The vanilla panacotta.... What can I say.... I died and went to food paradise!!!! For that extra dose of luxe.... We settled for the lovely Villa Calappiano... Simply divine sparkling vino....

For a posh restaurant we were made to wait for 45 minutes for our table inspite of making a booking. The food was very average.. Chicken was tasteless and just boiled.. The pizza sauce was sour and the gnocchi had the same sauce as the pizza. Not impressed at all! Especially for the kind of money you pay.. The food and service was a big disappointment!!! We had gone earlier and came away disappointed as well!

One word. Gorgeous. Italian can't be more authentic than this. The menu - detailed, comprehensive and illustrative. The service - amiable, yet poignant. The food - conservative, yet ecstatic. If you don't mind getting a little tipsy, you can ask for wine suggestion from the Ma√Ætre-d ( Sorry, will not use the word Waiter :P ). For people not that accustomed to the food of Paisans, Spaghetti Bolognese and Calamari is a good choice. Hadn't tried pizza, so Error-404 in it. Thumbs up - they give you a bowl of magic dust: Parmesan Cheese. Spread on your food and enjoy. Thumbs down - It will claim a chunk off your bank balance. Didn't try the desert, was low on cash. These are the points which makes you think that money really buys happiness. All in all, won't complain. :)

For the love of italian food, one must visit this restaurant.

What i like best is the excellence in the simple dishes. Tried the mushroom risotto and the Margherita VIP pizza. Both hit the perfect notes on the palette. Paired with a good white wine served at a correctly cool temperature was a delectable experience.

Chatted with the chef, was good to learn they know their mascarpone cheese (good from bad) and although i was full, i have earmarked the tiramisu as a must have next time i visit.

Good decor, good service, good italian food.

Quiet cool ambience on a hot Friday afternoon. Excellent service ( apart from the hard sell on the imported wine). Dishes ranged from good ( the thin crust pizza, prawn avocado arugula salad) to outstanding ( the tiramisu - looks huge but very light). A bit of overdose of the arugula leaves ( and not nearly enough prawns) on every dish, and the melon carpaccio not quite authentic ( no shaved Parmesan on top and too sweet a dressing). Overall a decent place for an above average Italian meal.

Well the 2 of us dropped by for dinner on a weekday to this italian eatery. Decor is chic and very spik n span. We got a cute lil table for us. Waiter was very courteous n explained all the dishes and their ingredients. Placed order for chicken breast paillard- it was a very diff dish, boneless chicken spread out on a plate and grilled 2 perfection. A dash of freshly ground pepper and olive oil kicked up the right flavours in dish. The waiters were agile and remembered 2 supply pepper with a dish. Next we ordered a special penne in alfredo sauce with chicken in place of pork. The penne was delicious and so creamy. To satiate our hunger, we ordered a simple pizza with chicken sausage and prawns toppings. Their pizza had a diff taste because of the cheese. Wrapped our dinner with waiter's recommendation of Tiramisu dessert and needless to say a bite of this tiramisu melted in my mouth. It was a very yummy dessert though making a hole in the pocket for a single dessert serve. All in all, it was a lovely experience. Ambience was nice and food was good too. Will come back again :)

Ambience: Above average. I liked their open kitchen for Pizzas. You can see the complete process of how handmade pizza doughs are made.

Food: Very limited menu but everything tastes great. We had Ravioli Al Porcini which had a great smell and a delicious taste. Never had a greater ravioli before. We also had their house special pizza with Truffle cheese and Truffle oil. It did not come with any toppings but it topped all the pizzas I have had. The taste of Truffle cheese was mouth watering. No doubt Truffle cheese is called a cheese to save for special occasions. Third we had Jumbo Shrimps Al Cognac which came with risotto and had a delicious gravy but could not meet the taste of the above two.

Service: Their service is great. I specially liked them giving suggestions for food. 

Value for Money: Although the place is costly but a worth try. You get to have a taste which is offered by none other. So if you are a foodie, the price would not matter. 

Overall: It was a great experience. Over the top taste of food. A must try Italian Restaurant.

I went there on Valentine's Day. To start with I was mesmerized with the ambiance, it's quite chic and the attendants were friendly.¬†Well, we went for the couple's lunch set-menu. It came with two 30 ml pegs of 12 year Chivas Regal. And the next episode was a history, and I don't like history. It was so forgettable that I cannot bear! The starters came good but with very little portion. The soup was a mere "Okay". The salads were good but again too little for two people. Then came the Margherita Pizza, they told us it was the best pizza in town, well, I have had better pizzas in Dominoes (And I hate Dominoes). The desert was a red velvet cake (with the theme of V-day in mind). It was also not up to the mark.¬†The bill was around 3200. And after the lunch was over I was still hungry and I'm not a fat man.¬†Terrible experience. Not recommending anyone!

Great food.¬† Goat cheese salad is quite excellent.¬† Pizza is as pizza should be; excellent dough.¬† Would be nice if there were more wine-by-the-glass options.

There's no quirky ambience, nothing that screams  "Italian". Setafina seems to be a no-nonsense-eat-and-go restaurant! 

Ordered a bruschetta to begin with. It was as if a mountain of tomatoes had descended upon the bread ! We almost had to dig through the tomatoes and find the bread. I don't think I've ever seen so much raw tomato on a plate in a restaurant! 

Then the Serafina chicken salad. Overloaded with dressing and everything else that was supposed to be on the salad. 

Ordered a spaghetti aglio olio with some modifications. The original recipe is pasta with garlic and chillies but they had added some peppers, olives and sundried tomatoes. The taste of the dish was surprisingly pretty good. 

Also ordered a Ravioli with Gorgonzola and Paprika. The dish was very unappetising looking when it arrived at the table. But one shouldn't judge a cheesy dish by its appearances! And with that I dug in! The Ravioli too was surprisingly pretty good. It was heavy as hell and I couldn't finish it all! 

The final thing we ordered was a ginger mojito. A good choice to wash all the cheese, oil and tomatoes down with ! 

The bill came to just a little under ‚Çπ3000

The food - 4/5
Ambience - kinda non-existent 
Value for money - 3.5/5 
Will I be returning in the near future - yes!

Walked in famished on a saturday afternoon at 3 and ordered.. I have just started.. With the bruschetta.. SO MUCH TAMATAR.. WHY?..I am serious, each pc of bread has 1 Bada tamatar equivalent.. Its overpowering.. But the chicken salad I just bit into.. Oh wow.. So nice..a little high on dressing, but very nice overall.. I have ordered for a "Bina Sauce wali Pasta" and my wife has ordered a ravioli.. Let's see how they turn out.. Do try the ginger mojito..especially if you have ordered a haavvy dish.. Aglio e olio is quite nice and the serving size is really good.. Thumbs up so far.. Good meal barring the bruschetta.. Would definitely return..

Yes a very good place with a nice ambience the decors goes very well with the theme, the staff is really helpful and polite the pizzas just blew my mind because of the thin crust, it was just amazing with the wine, the mocktails are also very nice if your tastebuds love the core Italian taste then this is the place for you! But the only thing is the food preparation takes time which can annoy you but if you've picked the right dish for you then it's worth the wait!

Serafina is one classical restaurant located again at the Heart of Kolkata. The food here can be described in two phrases "Lip smacking and Finger Licking Good". Specially the Pizza Margherita  with extra tinges of Mozzarella cheese. Also the hot and tangy pasta served here is  very tasty. Above all the Serafinas served here are just awesome. The Serafina with Tomato, Mozzarella, Egg and Garlic is my personal favourite. People seriously must try out Serafina here some time.

Excellent is the only word to describe this place. 
Whenever I feel like having Italian food this is the only place which comes to my mind! 

Love their pizzas especially the one called ala norcina which has a white sauce base instead of the plain and boring tomato sauce! Soft, crispy and completely melts in your mouth! I always make sure that I order their mashed potatoes as a side dish! Undoubtedly the best mash in town! 
Their desserts are the best I have had in Calcutta for sure! The chocolate mousse and the tiramisu are a must try! 
I love this place and can't wait to go back!

My expectations for Serafina were very high because of its reputation as a fine dining new york restaurant. At first glance the menu seemed impressive too as the pizzas mentioned several toppings such as aragula, buffalo mozzarella and truffle which are not normally available at italian restaurants around the city. But when were ordering we found out that the pizzas with these special toppings were not available. The waitor said this is a temporary issue but i found this issue in both my visits. Hence we ordered the regular dishes available. The dishes were tasty but i felt the pricing did not do justice to it. Other fine italian restaurants in the city offer the same quality of food and the same dishes at a more reasonable rate. I suggest that the restaurant should not keep such items in the menu if they cant serve them. Overall it was a very average food experience and did not match up to its hype.

I went to Serafina one fine evening with my wife and two-year old kid.. The positives first, the service levels here are second to none.. our waiter greeted us politely and even took our kid on a trip around the place when he started acting cranky. Not to mention, he also helped us choose from the menu.. Ah the menu,¬†this is where things get interesting.. We wanted to have an appetizer, preferably chicken.. the only option we got was the Serafina Chicken salad, which was good, no doubt, but having it as a starter felt a bit odd. The only other non-vegetarian appetizer (leaving aside fish, which I am not so fond of)¬†was the fried calamari, which my wife said NO to, since she almost puked when the waiter explained that it was basically a "fried baby octopus".. an apt description, but did not go down too well with my wife.. So, the salad it was.. Quantity was just ok for two people, and the taste was good, probably not worth the price.. then, we decided to have a pizza for main course..When we asked which Chicken pizza to go for, the reply came, "Sir, we have ONLY one Chicken pizza on the menu, Ala Norcina!" .. Ouch, that hurt, I said to myself. Just ONE option for chicken lovers?? Anyways, we were forced to order Ala Norcina and I said my holy prayers to God and wished that it would be worth the price they charge. Thankfully, the pizza was quite authentic in taste, made in thin crust style, with a nice strong cheesy flavor. Both me and my wife quite liked it. OK, so time for dessert now! The waiter asked us to order their Tiramisu and gave us a long speech (lasting about 1-2 mins) on why their Tiramisu is the best I would have ever had! OK, so we went for the Tiramisu, and yes, it was DELICIOUS, to say the least. Nice soothing¬†coffee aroma, utterly soft mascarpone cheese and a hint of chocolate.. they just hit the ball out of the park with this one. Very tasty and tempting.. difficult to have just one of these! Ok, so how was the overall experience? Mixed for sure. Chicken lovers, you are warned.. if you are ok with fish, shrimps and lamb, you can try out this place.. prices are definitely on the higher side due to their imported ingredients, but you can't argue with the taste and quality. Dinner for two (leaving aside my son who had to make do with a plate of French fries, which cost us Rs 200!) came to Rs 3,300.. yes, very expensive. But it's a nice place, and I'll probably visit again once they have added some more chicken dishes to their menu!

I had been to this place almost 5 months back. It was a farewell lunch for my wife, who was leaving the city for work. The thing about this place is that you need to know what to order. I didn't but thankfully my wife did. First we ordered Prosciutto E Bufaline and I think amazing would an understatement. You can simply feel the awesomeness of buffalo mozzarella. We followed it up with a Pizza, which was awesome too, but the real showstopper was the Panna Cotta. We ordered one, but could not resist the temptation of another.¬†

Serafina was an awesome overall experience. You can really feel the freshness of all the ingredients and that's what I loved about this place. The staff is friendly, but the ambiance needs some improvement.¬†

Waiting for my wife to be back, so that we can go there again and again.

what a disappointment! 

Their food was quite bad 
Pizza was dry.
My chicken pollo a-la  Milanese tasted just like breadcrumbs with the thinnest chicken breast possible. I had to borrow my friends fillet mignon sauce and 2 glasses of sangria to get this down my Damn throat. This isn't even a difficult dish to get right. Amplifying my disappointment. 
My friends medium done fillet mignon wasn't great either :(
Our calamari was so bad I almost wanted to go walk across to smoke house deli and have theirs! 
So other than the sangria nothing is working for them :(

Spent this Valentine's day here at serafina. With sky high prices and fine ambience, serafina made our day pretty good, if not exquisite! 
Started off with pegs of CHIVAS REGAL 12 years, we tried veg MINESTRONE SOUP, which was average to me.. but my partner disliked it.  D SOFIA SALAD was classic chicken caesar salad,  really loved by both of us.. the quantity was generous too. ARABIATTA SPICED CHICKEN in starters were like chicken cubes fried and spiced. i loved the tangy touch and must mention the chicken was super tender. 
The V.I.P MARGARITA PIZZA  was thin crust,  well baked, nothing extraordinary  ( i worship fire n ice for thin crust pizzas)
The next,  SPAGHETTI AGLIO OLIO AL PACINO was its best version i had.. though quantitatively on the lesser side, however its subtle taste made it up.
The special dessert of the day was a heart shaped cake, probably red velvet cake with cream cheese was a wonderful surprise. 
Though it being a little noisy on this special day,  the staff managed it quite efficiently.  Thank you serafina,  for making this day a special and memorable one!!  :)

I had high expectations from this place given the hype and the highly rated reviews but to be honest I was disappointed by the food. The service is good but the food served and the ambience is just average.! I'm being very modest by giving it a 3.5.
Little Italy serves the best Pizzas in Kolkata, I must say, none of the pizzerias beat that mark.!

I brought a group of 10 to serafina from California . We initially started at Bombay Brasserie but the waiters refused to open a little early and I'm so glad they did .

After a quick conversation with the chef at Serafina, explaining that my friends had not adjusted to time change yet, he agreed to open the house for us. 

The staff was kind, cordial and attentive and we took the chefs suggestion on starters, the special hand rolled ravioli and tiramisu for dessert. 

My guests are world travelers and have visited Itc, bombay brasserie , and many other restaurants since arriving but this was their favorite by far. They've already asked to come back at the next meal .... And one of the guests was italian !

This place is amazing! I was so proud to offer them something they truly enjoyed in terms of cuisine, atmosphere and service. 

Says wonders about the Serafina team and that they were willing to accommodate a 6pm dinner. 

Words cannot express my gratitude or pleasure of the evening . 

You guys rock!

One of the best pizzerias in town! After fire and ice, they serve the next best tasting pizzas here. The ingredients are authentic and imported directly - this shows in the taste and flavour. Ambience is great..like the European open restaurants. The service is great! If u have some appointment and wanna dine quick serafina is not the place. Service is great but slow. But then who wouldn't want some private time talking at a fine dining restaurant while waiting for the order?
Well I liked the pizzas we ordered but found that our friends add quite a bit of oil even in 'well done' pizzas! Guess I ll hafta tell them before hand. 'The' only place where you can decide how crispy you want your crust. Additional toppings aren't charged extra ... So if u do think u like a specific one in the menu but it misses out on your fav, you can get it in there!!
So fasten your seatbelts for the trip yo Italy!

Update as of 29-6-2015
Folks! Pls read my response to the management response down below! Yesterday I had a bad experience. The place is overcharging, that too with an additional cold shoulder from the waiters here. My rating reduces to 3.25! Goto Fire and Ice, believe me, WAYY better!

So one idle afternoon, I and my best friend decided to have some good food. So we were dillydallying whether to go to Yautcha or Irish house. When suddenly we saw this really cool and new diner opposite of Yautcha. The diner had real cool American eatery vibe with the tables outside and all. So we decided to enter. The restaurant was pretty empty and we got a real cosy table. My best friend was craving for meat. So we ordered two grilled fillet mignons. What came next was one of the most delightful culinary experience we had in recent times. The beef was cooked to top notch perfection. For once I saw a restaurant in Calcutta serving the dictionary definition of medium rare steak. The grilled vegetables were fantastic. The best part about the food was the huge basket of fries. 
Over all a very pleasant experience. Would love to visit again.

Started this year's Christmas fun with Italian cuisine fine dining at Serafina. Famous joint across the world known for their thin crust pizzas and pastas. While it was chili outside the ambiance inside the restaurant was warm and cozy. Located at 5th floor of Quest Mall the exterior was designed to give a feeling of outdoor seating restaurants in Europe. As you enter inside will have a welcome sight of live pizza baking counter.
The server explained us through the menu and informed that almost most of their ingredients been imported as they are particular about quality and taste. While going through the menu I immediately realized that options for non-veg is lesser compared to veg dishes. Finally settled with thin crust pizzas Alla Norcina and Formaggi D'italia. Also in pasta opted for Cannelloni Di Pollo E Funghi and Farfalle Al Limoncello. In desserts we finished with Il Tiramisu.

Alla Norcina: Thin crust pizza topped with mozzarella, mushrooms and spicy chicken chunks. Sprinkled with chili flakes and oregano.
Formaggi D'italia: Crust was delightfully thin and crispy topped with imported cheeses like fontina, mozzarella, parmigiano and gorgonzola. As per your taste can sprinkle few drops of olive oil on the top with chili flakes and oregano.
Cannelloni Di Pollo E Funghi: This is stuffed pasta from Chef's Special menu prepared with white creamy sauce. The wheat pasta prepared like roll and stuffed with chicken and mushroom.
Farfalle Al Limoncello: Bow tie shaped pasta cooked in white creamy sauce. Mixed with succulent baby shrimps, lemon zest and dash of lemon juice. The sauce was sinfully creamy was feeling like licking off the entire plate.
Il Tiramisu: Legendary North Italian dessert recipe and must to finish your meal on a sweeter note. Tagline says "Like Grandma used to make, maybe better".

Each and every dishes are recommended and must have. Best pizzas or pastas i ever had. Quantity of each portion is enough to two adults. Staff are very courteous. Bill amount came to INR 4829 with taxes but normal in case of fine dining where ingredients are imported. Reservation is must. Would request management to explore options to add more non-veg options in the menu.

The ambience is the only thing which dragged me in and the wish to try something new. Coming tk the food. Chicken ceasar salad is the most bland salad I have ever had. The pizza is the most lanky you will ever see. Although thin crust but it cannot stay straight for a single second it keeps on falling forcing people to eat it like a homemade roti. The pasta is another strict no no. 
I do not recommend the place to even my foe. Try quests food court it may surprise you but not shock.
P.S: The waiters had to be called 3-4 times till they finally decide to attend you at their will and the tips I paid for the food was Rs 2/-. Lastly it was a total nightmare.

It was my birthday and it was a surprise! My friend had planned everything beforehand and I was rather overjoyed!¬†
It started off as a normal dinner. I ordered a shrimp salad because I wasn't particularly hungry that night. My friend ordered a salad too. I took Sangria(white) and roasted potatoes to go with it.
I never thought that the salad would be so filling and we had to skip any heavy meal after that. I wasn't even up for dessert afterwards. So, I went ahead and asked for the check only to be surprised by a sudden 'Happy Birthday' tune and a surprise Tiramisu!¬†
I thought I'll just have a bite of it since I was so full. A couple of minutes later I realized that my hand was automatically reaching out for more bites and it was finished in no time. The mascarpone cheese was amazing. They said they import all the ingredients as they don't find it authentic enough here. And, it really reflected in their standard of food.
A special thanks for making my birthday so charming. And, keep up the good work!

Before starting the review, I would like to thank Serafina team to make my first marriage anniversary a memorable one. After lot of research and findings we chose this marvelous food destination. And we were blown away by the ambience, the food and the service. 
We ordered goat cheese salad and squid for starters and were advised to try basa by the staff. We really liked each of those items. 
The friendly yet humble nature of the team really made us feel special and I assume each of the good food lovers would feel the same way. Thank you and keep it up.

Again could try only a few things off the menu and I think I found the best bit.
Their cheese and garlic crostini really helped start the course which was an awesome 4 cheese pizza but my favorite of all was the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli in sage butter sauce. It was yum.
Gotta go for another round there in Calcutta next!

Would have rated 4.5 but rated 4 due to lack of non veg items , had to literally search for those few non veg items . I would prefer a bit more of them on menu card otherwise the food was good . We ordered a calamari for starter a preparation of fried squid and a goat cheese salad . While the calamari was good but would have liked a bit more goat cheese in the salad . In the main course we ordered a large 12" pizza alla norcina and I must say it's one of the best pizzas I have tasted and then we had penne pasta all arrabbiata which was also very tasty . Overall a very good place for Italian fine dining .

I decided to visit this place during my short trip to Kolkata recently. I was really impressed with the warm hospitality extended by the staff here. They were really courteous and prompt with the service.¬†

For starters we ordered for a cold bruschetta and gnocchi in red sauce- the red sauce and the taste of the tomatoes was really really good. This place just sets itself apart from others in Kolkata by using freshest of ingredients.¬†
We ordered for a pizza with pesto sauce and crepes with spinach and ricotta filling and red sauce. We did not realize that we ended up ordering all of the dishes in red sauce, but I had no regrets as I am a sucker when it comes to tomatoes and red sauce in Italian food.

The wine list was also very impressive and since they did not have JAcob's Creek in their list, I tried another Italian "Golden Sparrow" and the taste was just OK. For sweet endings we had Tiramisu- it is the best and the lightest and the freshest I have had till date- A MUST MUST HAVE when visiting this place!

I really hope they continue and maintain with same standards in terms of quality, service and addition of variety in their menu.¬†

A little expensive on the cost per head, but I would surely not think twice when I am craving GOOD ITALIAN FOOD!!

After seven long years my search for really good authentic Italian food came to an end after I walked in to "The Serafina" at the Quest Mall...... The Ambiance was lovely very much similar to my visit to Tuscanni, Italy almost seven years ago... The Staff was extremely polite and did give us an extremely warm yet professional ¬†welcome... But I have got to hand it over to the chef there.... I was totally unaware that I would be able to find "CALAMARI" or Squid here in Kolkata... ¬†Moreover the Pizza served to us by the choice of the Manager Mr. Somnath Banerjee was truly a delight.... Just after our starters we were served Bassa, Chicken breast and another one of my most favorite dishes "Australian Lamb Chops"...... Definitely a 10 on 10 scale score from my side..... KUDOS......

My wife & I visited this italian ristorante yesterday and we loved almost everything we tried. The arugula salad with goat cheese was a perfect start followed by a very well done pesto pizza with pine nuts on it. Since we did a half an half pizza, the other half was surprisingly rather average. The Penne pasta was just tangy enough and we literally over ate towards the last portion. Overall had a great and satisfying experience.

The ambience is good and the service too. The foods are quite satisfactory. They have a good collection of wine to go with the meals. What seemed to be the let down was the steep price. Definitely an over priced restaurant.

The menu hardly has non veg choices.... And the veg dishes were pretty ordinary and do not deserve the price..... Had heard a lot about the wine selection...but found it just about satisfactory

Been here with a lot of expectations was surely led down though apart from the pesto pizza and the desserts( which we tried all of) nothing else is even worth talking about...oh and not to mention it's severely overpriced

We decided to dine at Serafina last evening and it turned out to be a mixed bag. I heard so much of it that I entered the restaurant with very high hopes. For entr√©e  we ordered a portion of roasted potato with rosemary and a margherita  pizza. The potatoes were of the soft melt in mouth kind and quite flavourful. The pizza was however a let down and lacked the zing. I expected a better tasting wood fired pizza for sure.  For mains I ordered a Chicken Breast  Paillard which turned out pretty interesting. Hammered slice of Chicken Breast roasted in evoo  and served with a side of fresh tomato and arugula  salad. The salt was bit on the higher side though. The husband stuck to his usual penne  pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushroom which wasn't extraordinary either but priced at inr 795 felt too steep. Overall the service was good with the manager coming over to the table to enquire if everything was ok.

A total disappointment. Don't go by the pictures. The Grilled Steak was a rubber boat which they thankfully replaced with Mini Sliders . Still the Swiss cheese in it was a spoil sport. Ambiance nice. Not great of the resto's general standard.

We actually did not plan visiting serafina at the first place, we went to quest mall for Chilli's. But finding a huge waiting line in front of it, we decided to venture. This place was relatively less crowded. So me and my husband though of having an authentic italian dinner instead. First, the ambience of the restaurant is very good and cozy. Once upon entering you can smell the freshly baked pizza inside the oven. Anyways, we were directed towards our table by very courteous staff of the place. The service they offer can be exactly categorised under fine dining experience. They personally made sure that we understood each and every term the food item meant. Good for those who might not be familiar with food names in italian.
Anyways, a meal for two may cost somewhere over 2k, excluding alcoholic beverages. So if someone wants to take out his girlfriend on a special ial date or you want to surprise your wife on her birthday, this place is a top choice.

It was a sudden decision to go and have a Pizza. Staff very polite and nice.
Pizza was cold when served and I realized that they have Pizza Margherita ready and just put toppings on it.¬†
Had the Pizza been hot would had been lovely.¬†
The Parma ham was sliced very miserly on the Pizza. Would had been better had they charged a bit more and the Parma Ham would had been a bit more.

Serafina has refined Italian cuisine in Kolkata. The price you pay for the experience at Serafina is completely worth it. 
Wine list: You will be spoilt for choice with their wide range of imported wines. 

Service: The servers have good knowledge about which wine you should pair with your choice of dish. Very prompt and warm hospitality. 

Appetiser: Prosciutto ham on bruschetta. The quality of meat was excellent. Thin smoked slices of ham were placed on a bed of mozzarella and served on bruschetta (4 makes a portion) The olive oil and seasoning on the top made it even better. 

Entr√©e: Gluttons pick: Saffron risotto with jumbo prawns tossed in a cognac sauce, which is a #Mustorder! This was a cracker dish, divine in every bite, lovely balance of flavours between the cognac sauce and the cheesy risotto. Very smooth to the palate, the risotto had a beautiful silken retire to it. You would want to lick the sauce of the plate and still crave for more! 

The menu predominantly has vegetarian options to which you may ask to add bacon, chicken, ham or prawn. 
We also ordered for the Aglio Olio Spaghetti with bacon. A complete contrast from the previous dish in terms of flavour and texture. They also served a bowl of grated Parmesan on the side. The spaghetti came with generous helpings of bacon, lots of 'Aglio' and was made quite greasy with all the 'Olio' smothered over it. Exquisitely prepared, and very delicious, though it can begin to taste slightly monotonous after a couple of bites. I took the liberty of adding my own culinary touch to the dish by adding some more chilli olive oil, almost overturned the bowl of Parmesan and added some chilli flakes and oregano. The authentic Italian Aglio Olio was then ready to please my Indian palate. The meal was delectable and we didn't feel very heavy even after such a cheesy affair. 

Dessert: The Signature Tiramisu and Chocolate Mousse. 
The Tiramisu was pure decadence- a sin you would want to commit over and over again. The base was a sponge cake soaked in strong coffee, the aroma of which would drive a coffee lover momentarily insane. Creamy, soft textures and the concoction of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee make the Tiramisu an absolute delight. The Chocolate mousse was bitter-sweet, fluffy, light and chocolaty. However, very honestly, the Tiramisu was so overpowering, that only a diametrically opposite flavour like a raspberry sorbet or something would stand out. Ordering similar flavours with the Tiramisu is not recommended. 

Verdict: The experience at Serafina was one of the best culinary experiences for Italian I have had till date. In terms of service, quality of food and the money invested (though it's quite expensive), my meal at Serafina was completely worth it.  On a related note, Alto Vino (Mariott) is also good. And for a lower budget, Fire and Ice is a great option. 

Pocket Pinch: Rs 5000 for two (without alcohol)

Have been there twice so far. It was an overall enjoyable experience each time and I found the dishes mostly authentic. The arugula salad was crisp, fresh and delicious as was the parmesan. My main course the first time was spaghetti squash and I found that it was really delicious and original. Would like to suggest that they propose the grated parmesan with this dish as it enhances it completely. My second experience was the eggplant parmigiana and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. The strips of eggplant were breaded and fried which took away from the fresh vegetable-ness of this dish, plus the sauce was way too salty. Dessert was a great treat - we had the chocolate mousse and it was divine. Wine was good albeit pricey and the service was impeccable. Waiters were attentive and good natured without being in our faces as in some places where they seem to try too hard. Noise level was high as in many Kolkata restaurants - I wish people would give more attention to this aspect, as it can destroy the atmosphere of a relaxing meal.

Went to this place with friends on the Ashtami eve. Ordered Papardelle di Portofino, Ravioli Al Porcini and Baby pork chops. Food was good, although while ordering no one mentioned that they make Pasta "Al Dante" or stiff, as the Italians like it. We also were surprised to see that bread basket was not on the house, when asked they said it was on the house in their Mumbai branch .. but not in Kolkata. Service was friendly .. although waiting time was slightly high , but to charge Service Tax worth 10% was absolutely ridiculous. I had ordered a Ginger Lychee Mojito which I asked for a refill  and was excellent. So overall mixed feelings with a high pocket pinch ... but worth a second try.

@Serafina - I wouldn't want to go there a second time as though the food was very good the service was pathetic to say the least. We are a family of 4, and we ordered one pizza, one chicken dish and 2 of us ordered the Filet Mignon. The pizza and the chicken took about 20 minutes but it took 45 minutes for the steak to be served. Very disappointed with the service - should be better as they charge a 10% service charge

Wine & Dine @ Serafina
Finally Kolkata has got an authentic Italian den with some nice Super Tuscan wines.
We were a group of 6 and was lucky to get a nice cosy sofa seat to celebrate one of ours birthday.
The staff was very attentive and helpful in suggesting our dishes.
We found the soup was bit average but the Serafina chicken salad was too good with the right amount of pesto dressing. Bruscheta and pizzas was ok. 
Being a birthday evening we ordered a bottle of Brunello red wine to celebrate and went with the service staff recommendation to have New Zealand lamb chops. What a combination and thanks for the perfect suggestion from the wait staff.
The ambiance was very nice and now came the special moment of the dinner when we was presented a birthday cake with all the staff singing birthday song with a musical background was truly amazing.
Thank you Serafina for the excellent service and making our birthday so special and memorable.

Good pizza and pasta, I didn't like the mushroom ravioli. Passionfruit ice tea was very refreshing. Service was good but they seated us outside saying that inside was reserved but by the time we left their inside was still half empty. This practice is followed by all restaurants on this floor at Quest. Water was dripping from the AC vent in the ceiling. The complaint was ignored.

The much awaited visit finally happened today but after all the expectation I was highly disappointed with average food taste and below average service. The pizza was brought before the soup and appetiser and henceforth when the pizza was brought it as cold. 
Totally unexpected from a self proclaimed fine dining restaurant. 
The presentation was very average. The waiter wasn't very helful either. 
I would definitely not go again.

Right, so my review of one of two most anticipated restaurants of Calcutta comes a week after my visit with family. After a lot of deliberation I feel this is an honest review and rating.
To start of, let me bring down the expectations a little. When we arrived, we received a warm enough greeting but the seating was horrible. In spite of having the second name on the list and a reservation for 8, we were squeezed onto a moderate 6 seater (2 4+4 square tables) even though they had an 8 seat table joined and ready but the guest was yet to arrive. This wasnt the first name on the list as I recall it being for a group of 4.
Anyhow, on to the ordering process. The menu is simple and concise and the waiters were no help in suggesting good dishes. We were pretty much left to our own choices after we asked for explanation on the dishes and we were met with the questions being bounced from one waiter to another till someone knowing the information could speak up. Not off to a good start then. Food is served and as a family we are looking at it in great anticipation until we decide to ask them to serve the dishes to us... every dish at a time.
Now, fortunately the worst bit ended here. The food was as you would expect from any new or well branded Italian joint. It was authentic and nice. Not to be compared with other Italian staples like Fire n Ice as they are more southern Italian flavours and have wet sauces. The dishes here are more dry sauces and rich with cheeses.
The arrabiatta, pomodoro, pizzas, risotto were all very good and the best part was that the sauces and flavours were fresh. To add to that, the portions were generous and maybe 2 mains and an appetizer are enough for 2 people. That said, the prices and value for money were disappointing. To pay 1500 per person in an exclusive restaurant (but still one thats in a mall) with not so great seating in and outside and that too for a vegetarian meal with no alcohol is a little steep.
I wouldn't say that I have been completely put off by the experience as the decor and ambiance inside was nice with dark wood furniture, a classy bar counter and generous portions, but maybe another visit will be warranted after their service teething issues are sorted out.
Overall
Food: 3.5. Generous portions but nothing stellar for the price. In fact still expensive in totality. Also, the limited variety at the prices will need regular revisions as one may tend to get bored of seeing the same dishes.
Service: 3. Although courteous, the seating¬†fracas¬†and the lack of knowledge of the staff was disappointing. Additionally having to be told for each dish to be served was quite annoying.
Ambiance: 3.5 The decor indoors is very nice but the outdoor seating lacks a little distance. The passing visitors in the mall are too close for comfort if you are eating outside.
Value for Money: 3. The fact that the prices are rather high and we paid this on a meal for 6+2 little kids (5 yr olds) and that too on a vegetarian only meal coupled with the service snags gave it quite a beating.


¬†Still, I will be visiting again to give their non-vegetarian dishes a try.

Visited this newly opened joint today. Did not really meet upto my expectations mainly because the menu felt a bit restricted especially in the non veg options. The menu had a variety of pizzas no doubt but we were in no mood for one and wanted to try Italian food outside pizza. The serafina margarita was really good along with the shrimp and arugula salad. The tuna item in the starters was a bit too rare to our liking though it looked fabulous. We were disappointed to find out the non veg pasta section was too small, (though they had a long list of veg ones). There was no nonveg option for lasagne or ravioli. We ended up with pasta with mutton Bolognese which was decent. The basa item with avocado and brinjal was good as was the hammered chicken. The tiramisu however was heavenly and was perhaps the only dish worth a revisit. The pocket pinch is a tad too much, but acceptable. Just hope they increase the nonveg items in the menu so that we could visit again....

Since our first few choices for dinner were overbooked, we decided to go this restaurant and I was quite disappointed. ¬†

Our order was quite basic, Margherita pizza with basil and buffalo mozzarella and spaghetti again olio with a kiwi mojito and Mexican monitor for drinks. Being a busy Saturday day night, the staff wasn't very attentive and we had to call out more than twice each time for them to notice. The pasta was incredibly bland and we had to add a lot of seasoning to make it edible, the mojitos were quite weak in terms of alcohol as well. The only saving grace was the pizza with a generous sprinkling of cheese as well as a delicious, fragrant sauce, albeit a bit greasy. ¬†However at over Rs. 2000 (600 of which was tax) ¬†for mediocre portions and average food, I don't think I would be coming here anytime soon.

To cut a long review short - it is a good place with great food and service that needs to be worked upon.

Now to the long review -¬†
I went there a couple of days back with my family. Overall the food, ambience and place is very good. The food is close to authentic italian and prepared well. One word of caution the portions are fairly good sized and so be careful in the amount you order. I certainly hope they do not reduce the portions as it is at present well priced given the quantity. Lesser food would certainly make this overpriced.
Being a large group we ordered a number of items:
Soup of the day - Minestrone - very well seasoned and lovely. Not the overly spiced stuff you get in a lot of places.
D. Chopra Salad - really good mix of flavours and again a good portion. Was my second choice as the first the Goats Cheese salad was not available.
Focaccia Bread Basket - not much good. was hoping for nice thick focaccia but it was more like pizza dough slices.
Penne with arrabiata sauce - Excellent - the spice levels were perfect and the pasta cooked just al dente. maybe a tad over.
Margherita Pizza - we ordered the VIP version with imported italian "fior di latte" mozzarella and the flavours showed - maybe the premium buffalo mozzarella will be even better but it was not available. This is the margherita pizza to beat in Kolkata now.
Pizza with seasonal vegetables - excellent as well if you like mushrooms, olives etc. - prepared with fresh whole olives it converted me a no-olive person into eating them. wonderful pizza.
Vegetarian Lasagna - excellent, with lots of veggies, cheese, pasta and sauce. not overly cheesy nor too much tomato.
Asparagus Risotto - the best risotto in town hands down... great flavour of the rice, the wine and the cheese.
Gnocchi - wanted to try it but they could not prepare it on time for some reason.
Tiramisu - if you go to serafina make sure you keep some space for this. thats all I can say.

The food was great. The ambience quite nice. Misses were the haphazard food delivery. The soups first then the bread then salad along with penne. after that one pizza then risotto then another pizza then lasagna. It should have been served together and if they followed the "serve fresh" principle then we should have been told and we would have ordered accordingly. One item we ordered did not come and when we asked were told that it would take time. We just cancelled it then.¬†

What lets serafina down is the service (I hope management takes note of this). For their prices the staff has to be discreet but attentive and quick. I did not like the wait staff breathing down my neck when i was looking over the bill and making the payment. No service of the food to the different members. a plate is brought out and put on the table and thats it. If you are sharing the plates then you keep asking and ultimately just do it yourself. What I just did not like was the 10% service charge when the service was quite pedestrian.¬†

However all in all now that I've experienced it I would still go back as I liked the food enough to overcome the other shortcomings and give it a pretty decent rating of 4.0.

If you love Italian cuisine then Serafina is the place to be. One can get authentic Italian Pizzas and Pastas at this place. I would suggest everyone to try out the Di Fabio pizza which is served with mouth watering paper thin ham toppings. Though the price is a bit on the higher side but the Italian dining experience is worth the amount spent.

iv had the best italian food in Durban and nothing comes close to it at a fraction of the price.
i had high hopes for this place :-(

Serafina, a new Italian restaurant in Kolkata. Went there for lunch, seating outside is a great idea like street side restaurant in Europe. We ordered a pizza with mushroom chicken and white sauce, it was really nice and different and one home made pasta with pesto sauce, but the pasta was not satisfying for me because it was not boiled properly. 

They have big variety on pizzas but other items on the menu are little over-expensive. Overall experience is good but honestly next time will have only pizzas.

The mocktails were quite nice in taste and quantity and reasonably priced.

The new italian joint in kolkata , went there  for nice evening with the family , nice ambience.
 Does not have a very large seating inside but cozy enough, but to noisy on the weekends .
Ended up ordering al funghi pizza which was nice , a pink sauce homemade pasta called paglia & fieno which was okay ; ravioli ai porcin was very good and also the tiramisu is a must have not very sweet but just right .

Overall a good place to try out.

Lot of other stuff on the menu i wanted to try but the quantity of food is large. 

A little expensive on the pocket but okay for once a while.

Visited this outlet on their second day of opening.
My vegetarian fare - fettucine with basil....was average. Could have been better.
The non-veg food ordered by my friends was not upto the mark, and so we decided to try the dessert.
The Tiramisu was the best part of our ENTIRE meal, Must try it.
Expensive place for an average fare....

In every relationship there comes a time when you're bored or unsure of the same old places to eat. Now re-boot your mood at Serafina and make this a great day out! Serafina Kolkata offers its authentic Northern Italian fare, from appetizers and salads to pastas and pizzas all made with the freshest ingredients. Ambiance will give you a homely feeling with a well ‚Äì stocked bar and an open pizza station complete the look of the place. Absolutely delicious food, huge portions and excellent professional service from the friendly waiter. A little expensive but for quality and quantity worth every penny! Warm crunchy pizza and warm chilli and mutton pasta exquisite and dripping with cheese & butter, Parma Ham with Rocket and Parmesan Pizza, equal to the excellence I have sampled in Hayat. Serafina Kolkata serves over 24 varieties, ranging from classics, such as Marinara & Margherita to the very sophisticated, featuring rear ingredients such as Tartufo Nero, simply mind blowing. ¬†
Avocado & Shrimps ‚ÄòSan Pietro‚Äô was awesome, made with avocado and baby shrimps, arugula, grape tomatoes & cannellini beans in champagne mustard sauce, just heavenly. In pasta Penne Primavera all Arrabbiata made with spicy tomato sauce, fresh vegetables and crushed red pepper tasted good but my heart was carving for more. I tried 2 non veg pasta Rigatoni Alla Bolognese made with chopped mutton and Farfalle All Limon cello the unique bow tie pasta with baby shrimps, lemon zest and touch of cream. Farfalle All Limon cello was just heavenly, bow tie pasta with soft baby shrimps in cream tastes out of this world. I suggest you try that dish! I think this is a great place for friends to share a bottle of wine and order some things to share. With lively ambiance along with the wood fired pizza‚Äôs and handmade pasta‚Äôs will definitely tempt you to revisit this place.
I will love to end with famous quote: ‚ÄúThere is no love sincerer than the love of food‚Äù - George Bernard Shaw.
