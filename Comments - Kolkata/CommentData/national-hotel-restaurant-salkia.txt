This place is just near my house. I used to have food from here since my childhood, they had a great taste of food that time especially biryani and chicken chap. Now the taste of food has decreased biryani is not all upto mark, now I like only tengri kabab which is still the same.

It's a very old place..
I've used to come to this place since my childhood...

it has traditional type seating arrangements.. and introduced a family section also from a few years back..

they serves only Indian & Moglai Cuisine ...
the taste of foods was very good when I was much younger.. but now a days I did't get that flavor in the items.. but not that bad as well...

for the local residents.. it's a good place for having Indian Dishes..

An old restaurant. Have heard tales from my father saving up money to eat here once in a while.
Having food here from my childhood. Before the RD Mall opened in Liluah, it was the only standard restaurant around Salkia, Howrah serving quality Mughlai food. (Sabir had a very short lived presence of a few years in front of Sammelan park but closed due to dwindling customers). Recently they have increased the seating capacity and decorated the interiors. Their USP I feel is the Chicken Rezala and Rumali Roti. It was our fixed takeaway order whenever we returned home from Kolkata at night without having dinner. Their Biryani is on the better scale but lacks consistency. At times it's average but at certain times it's too good. I would suggest you to turn up early to get the best food. The chaap is too spicy. Overall one of the top Mughlai restaurants among the limited options in Howrah.
