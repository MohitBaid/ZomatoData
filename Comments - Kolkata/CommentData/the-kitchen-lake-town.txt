Newly opened restaurant in laketown just beside the clock tower. A very proper welcome was given by welcome drinks and papad which was very nice of them. We had ordered the forest mushroom soup which was very different and was something nice to try. Along with it coriander dim sum which had the authentic taste of it and the dimsums were so properly made.
The owner itself was greeting the guests which was a nice gesture. Food was good. Ambience was also good. Just that there was excessive lights. Keeping the ambience sover makes the customers comfortable. Hope the same service continues. All over a v nice place to visit. Must try. Hope to go again soon. All the best

This is a restaurant newly opened on 19th January.They have really spent a lot of money on their interiors and ambience. But the food quality and service is not at all upto the mark. I would really like this place to turn up to high standards very soon but right now I was highly disappointed.

One of the worst service experience ever seen that too on the day of grand opening what else people can expect from such resto where  people used to sit for 1 hours approx without serving on table really a local resto can bear huge expense on decor to be like 4 star but cannot served like them because what matters is the quality of staff you have .... 

Management really need to work on this to sustain in this competitive market ü§î

The ambience is quite good, I visited the place yesterday and co incidentally it was their inaugural day the reason for which we were offered with a welcome drink and a chocolate pan at the end....I think the staffs were extra polite and asked us several times about the service and food which is not necessary as it somewhere hampers the privacy...overall it's a must try for once at least !

The foods amazing at the given price. Waiters, are friendly. I loved the veg jhalfrezi, yellow dal tadka and the chocolate pan!
Even though the place boasts of fine dining, sadly you wont get that experience. Its more of an upscale restaurant at pocket friendly prices.
