One of the best places in Quest mall to grab a quick beverage. The place is spacious enough for the passerby crowd to grab a bite or a drink. Service is excellent, staff is very cordial. 
They make  an excellent fresh lime soda, hot chocolate isn't all too bad, I have had better. Never tried any food items. Will do that next time around. Recommended!

Nice good place for coffee and pastries. Very good qwality and cheap rates. Located at the basement of quest mall. And as they say a cup of coffee can do wonders.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs a good book and a cup of coffee that can help you get back again to your daily rat race. Of course these pieces of isolation and solace are very rare to acquire these days from any living object roaming around unless it an infant or your pet dog! So, I would like to share my favorite nook which I have discovered few days ago in a bustling mall. Confused? Don‚Äôt be, there is this place called Cafeccino which¬†is a cozy little coffee shop located at the basement of Quest Mall (Kolkata) absolutely isolated from the glitz and flutter of the busy Quest Mall. And if you are lucky enough and have some of your best buddies or close family members along with you then you are sure to love this place for its cold coffee, iced teas, sandwiches & delectable pastries. You really can‚Äôt miss this place if you are a coffee lover, that‚Äôs for sure. Also it might give you a bit of respite in between those hectic shopping sessions! It‚Äôs somewhat the perfect spot to sit with your favorite book or with your best buds while sipping the cuppa.
                                          ...

This is a cozy place situated next to Spencer's in quest mall. This place has reasonable prices and is good and is more private than the food court. I like the cakes here, they are fine but not amazing. The sizes of pastries are pretty big and my favourite amongst those is the chocolate pastry. They cold coffee was a bit watery and the hot chocolate was nice. Overall the place is average.

Had a great time time there. Irish cafe was superb but the cappuccino was not that strong. The sitting arrangements is not good and needs to be improved. The chocolate muffin was a let down. For a bill of 280 I would say it was not worth the money.

You will find Cafeccino on the basement of Quest mall. It is a small cozy place with 3-4 tables. The service is good, food is good (except the hot chocolate which tastes like bournvita) and the price is quite reasonable.

Do not miss ordering the Chocolate cup cake. It's delicious!

It was my first visit to this place. 
Experience is somehow mixed ... 

For the first time I tried something different in the coffee menu. A coffee not only orange flavoured but also you'll will find real orange in the coffee. Which was entirely new concept for me.
I loved the tests of that coffee. 

Their price is reasonable. It was only rs 130 for the larger cup. 

Do visit. 
It is just in front of starmark in quest mall.

The previous location of Cafeccino in the basement was better. This location is odd and looks a bit¬†disorganized¬†since it's right in front of the gate of Starmark and Spencer's baggage counter.

I LIKE THEIR: I love the Blueberry Cheese Pastry. I had it as my birthday cake and it's the best blueberry cheesecake I've had in town (but I was so disappointed just today, for the first time, when I packed 2 of them for home, which I always do, and figured the cream was sour and stale). The Dutch Truffle Pastry is awesome. Their lemons tarts (which was once the dessert of the month) came for ‚Çπ40 per two and it tasted really good. The Roasted Chicken Sandwich. They grill it for you and it tastes so awesome!

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: Chicken Tikka Sandwich. Full of onion and the sauce was sweet. Cold Coffee. Just not the way I prefer. Pineapple Pastry. Very regular and not the taste I expected. Lacked sweetness and felt like some sugar-free pastry. Black Forest Pastry. Hot chocolate was ok-ok!

When you are tired doing your monthly grocery shopping at the Spencers and ticked off all the items on the shopping list, head straight to the Cafeccino outlet at the basement itself to reward yourself. Their cappuccino is very good and a bit of a surprise. You would expect something like this from a s speciality coffee shop. A small outlet, they don't ave much seating but have enough for you to eat and drink. We tried their walnut brownie and a veg puff along with the coffee and all 3 items were good. The menu is reasonably priced compared to the other coffee shops at the mall and serve equally good stuff at a much lower price point. Good going!

Our usual Friday night-out sojourn took us to Quest this weekend. And as we were entering Starmark, the display counter of Cafeccino caught my eye. While I did manage to read the first few chapters of chitra divakaruni's new book, my mind was on that delightful display!
So what we brought back home were the blueberry cheesecake, a walnut brownie and a pineapple pastry.
My Sis, the cheesecake fiend/snob, of course declared that she wouldn't be sharing with anyone (so what's new?!).
The next morning, Ma declared the pineapple gateau heavenly.
My Sis declared the cheesecake 'probably the best in town'.
My hubby and I echo my Sis re the cheesecake - it was light and pillowy, melt in your mouth yum! And not overly sweet.
The Walnut Brownie, which I am back to devouring now that chocolate doesn't give me a migraine anymore (I think), was gooey solid chocolate with a brownie base. No complaints.
Sis and I have already planned our next visit, when we shall be sampling their cold coffee (Sis), and the savouries that Cafeccino has to offer.
Really looking forward.

I bought a blueberry cheesecake from the shop.. a three layered crust icing cake which I can drool over for life time.. at first I thought a piece of pastry so overpriced.. but after having few bites from it.. I totally felt it was worth it.. Blueberry cheesecake@INR 100. He also packed it in a beautiful box, with a candle and a small plastic knifes and few tissues with no extra cost. #lovedit

Located in basement of quest mall where Spencer's was. Small outlet which serves delicious coffee surprisingly at affordable price. Mostly crowded and we know why... so hardly you get seat to sit. Ambitious was really good. Service in reasonable time and hospitality was very nice. I really like their coffee specially cappuccino both hot and iced. They were very tasty and perfectly made. Their snacks and pastries were also very tasty and delicious. It's an must visit place because hardly you get such affordable coffee which also tastes delicious at expensive mall like quest. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

Cafeccino was on my list. Finally gave a visit to their place. A small cute joint just beside spencers and starmark. The staffs are very friendly. Their non-veg sandwiches were out so ordered walnut brownie and fanta. The service was prompt. The size of the brownie was okhay. When i had its first bite i was in heaven. Being a brownie lover i was totaly taken aback by the richness and softness of this brownie. O my god. It was a piece of sinfully delicious brownie. I loved it. Gonna have this browniw everytime i visit this place. On my next visit i will definately try sandwiches and double chocolate shake. 
A must try is the walnut brownieüòçüòçüòç.

Located on the ground floor of quest mall next to the entrace of starmark store. This is small coffee shop serving a range of drinks and eateries at a resonanle price when you think that its located in quest!! On weekends its quite full and its difficult to find seating space given that shoppers after expensive shopping look for reasonable food to eat and that too with quick service. The outlet is very nicely done and has a wide array of pastries, cakes, sandwiches, samosas, patties, tea, coffee and coolers. The staff is also courteous and the outlet delivers a bang for the buck. We had ordered a chicken tikka sandwich and cappacino. The sandwich was grilled and its filling was extremely tasty ( perfect mix of chicken, spices and onion/tomatoes). Absolutely juicy and delightful. The capaccino tasted good but could have been better. Their large cup is actually very large and can easily satisfy the caffeine craving of 2 people.

Cafeccino is located in the basement of Quest mall,near Spencers.It's basically a cafe shop along baked products. We ordered a blueberry cheese cake for one of my friend's birthday. It's mouthwatering,delicious and divine.They also used to serve tasty blackforest pastries. Coffees are enjoyable.

Had visited this cafe place last year which is situated inside quest mall near Spencer's entrance where you deposit your bags counter well exactly opposite is this cafe or rather I would say an open in house cafe .
My first encounter happened when I was with a couple of friends and we decided to check this place out so we went through the menu and there were a lot of pastries ,coffee, tea and other savouries options ,so without any delay we ordered these stuffs -

1) Two mocha coffee
2) One cappuchino coffee
3) One blue berry cheese cake
4) One pineapple pastry
5) chocolate muffin

Let's get into a quick briefing about all the listed above, so first taking about the muffins well it was soft ,dark and a bit dry I felt however just ok then moving on to the blueberry cake and pineapple pastry I would say the blue berry is pretty much more flavoured and it looks nice too but the pineapple pastry looks very filigree and more of vanilla than the pineapple was there in it .
Any finally the last two things which was coffee of course so first the cappuchino was there which tasted pretty ok even after mixing the side sugar for quite sometime however the good thing about this place was the Mocha coffee which is Mocha latte ,as it really had a strong aroma of coffee and was made like the perfect blend as you want it to be or expect it to be in other words .

Hence this place needs to improve little in food and drink factor other wise service is very good only thing is that they charge some great amount of cash for their offerings in comparison to other cafes as they are new in the business so I would prefer to have somewhere else paying a little more than coming here as not much of a difference is their in the rates and repute cafes in the city so the management needs to check that out soon for future progress.

A variety of sandwiches,puffs,pastries and coffee is available here. We had black forest pastry and chocolate  truffle,both were really good,with just the correct amount of sweetness. Definitely recommended. Must try.

A coffee deserves a crisp and chic review. Been to a lot of Cafeccino outlets in the airports. And all have one same problem. I generally try the "Mocha Latte" and have always seen that the coffee is a little too dilute. I dont understand what milk they use. One would feel that they mix a lot more water into the milk than required. For gods sake please stop concentrating on the profit margin and start looking into the coffee quality (message for the management). U guys dont charge anything less than other coffee shops. Time to give a boost to the coffee quality. Else m not recommending anyone.

1) Two mocha coffee
2) One cappuchino coffee
3) One blue berry cheese cake
4) One pineapple pastry
5) chocolate muffin

Let's get into a quick briefing about all the listed above, so first taking about the muffins well it was soft ,dark and a bit dry I felt however just ok then moving on to the blueberry cake and pineapple pastry I would say the blue berry is pretty much more flavoured and it looks nice too but the pineapple pastry looks very filigree and more of vanilla than the pineapple was there in it .
Any finally the last two things which was coffee of course so first the cappuchino was there which tasted pretty ok even after mixing the side sugar for quite sometime however the good thing about this place was the Mocha coffee which is Mocha latte ,as it really had a strong aroma of coffee and was made like the perfect blend as you want it to be or expect it to be in other words .

Hence this place needs to improve little in food and drink factor other wise service is very good only thing is that they charge some great amount of cash for their offerings in comparison to other cafes as they are new in the business so I would prefer to have somewhere else paying a little more than coming here as not much of a difference is their in the rates and repute cafes in the city so the management needs to check that out soon for future progress.

I think they have the best caramel coffee, as compared to Barista lavazza, CCD and Coffee bean&tea leaf in Kolkata. The roasted chicken sandwich is a delight too.

This is a small outlet in the basement of Quest Mall besides Spencer's and Starmark. The staff were courteous and helpful. The service too was good...efficient and swift. A variety of sandwiches,puffs,pastries and coffee is available here. We had black forest pastry and chocolate  truffle,both were really good,with just the correct amount of sweetness. Definitely recommended. Must try.

A coffee deserves a crisp and chic review. Been to a lot of Cafeccino outlets in the airports. And all have one same problem. I generally try the "Mocha Latte" and have always seen that the coffee is a little too dilute. I dont understand what milk they use. One would feel that they mix a lot more water into the milk than required. For gods sake please stop concentrating on the profit margin and start looking into the coffee quality (message for the management). U guys dont charge anything less than other coffee shops. Time to give a boost to the coffee quality. Else m not recommending anyone.

I had heard about the blueberry cheese pastry from a friend and since nothing else in the menu appealed to me,I had that only. Tasted perfect and is totally worth the price.¬†
Would like to try the beverages sometime.
And hope to see more items and more variety in the dessert menu. Muffins and cakes are there but too common.

This place is just too good for lovely fresh soft mouth watering pastries and snacks . I tired their black forest pastry and pineapple pastry . It was just heavenly. Super yummy. The cream was just so fresh and the cake melted in mouth. The size of the pastry also too good. It was quiet big .filling.. I would say worth paying here . Guys just drop in and have here once . I m sure you won't regret . I m sure gonna jump there again to have those pastries ..

Its a really cozy place to sit and have a chat, especially if you want to avoid the crowd and noise of the food court above.
There are a lot pastries and other eateries, but what I really liked was their green tea - without milk and sugar. I've had green tea before but never liked it as much as this.
The price is quite reasonable and service speedy. Must visit if you're looking forward to a calm and tranquil chat over coffee :D

Cafeccino isn't a place you'll notice easily when you visit Quest Mall. It's tucked away in a corner of the basement right outside the exit to Spencer's. It isn't as gallantly decorated as Q33, however the place is quite a hit to regular shoppers at Spencer's or Starmark.
The pastries are especially fulfilling. The blackforest cake and the blueberry cheesecake are awesome and big enough to be shared if you have the heart for it. The sandwiches are fresh and can be categorized as healthy food. The price isn't exorbitant, but it does fall towards the more expensive side. Although, this counter is cheaper than most you'd get at Quest. 
The dessert from Cafeccino is highly recommended. I'm told they even bake 2lb cakes if you order from beforehand.

I have passed this small corner coffee cafe everything I visit Spencer's or starmark and today I decided to grab a bite to eat and drink at cafeccino. It was okay. Not that great. We ordered coleslaw sandwich, lemon iced tea and brownie on ice. The sandwich was still tolerable, the drinks were average. The brownie on ice had this really bitter taste and no ice. I usually do not give bad reviews but in this is case the cafe's food and beverages were below average. I'm sure their other drinks might be good.

This place is located in the basement of the quest mall. They serve awesome cold coffee with fresh cream. The roasted chicken sandwich is really awesome and juicy. One of the best sandwiches I had. Their blackforest cake was really bad and I got a bit disappointed with this place. However, they have a pineapple pastey which is nice. One thing you do expect from a safe like this is them to add dalda to make the cream for the pastry. It's outrageous. I hope they use full fresh cream in the future.
The staff is friendly and helpful.

Location: Opposite Spencers, Basement, Quest Mall.

This is a small coffee shop which serves good quality food and can be a nice stop to re-energize amidst shopping.
Was visited after a shopping round at spencers and the first thing that caught my eyes were the delicious looking pastries and the orange-black colored seating arrangement for around twenty heads.

Coming straight to our order, the following was ordered:

- Cafe Latte
The latte was nothing exceptional, tasted decent. Could have been better. Add sugar as per your preference. :)

- Mocha Latte with an add-on of Caramel flavor
Amazing it was! Had the right balance of caramel and chocolate, balanced sweetness.
Recommended.

- Hawaiian Coleslaw Sandwich
Was nicely grilled and the filling of coleslaw was generous. But, the salt levels were too low.

- Dutch Truffle Pastry
Absolute Chocolate indulgence!! Have it heated or frozen, you'll love it!
Highly recommended.

About the STAFF, they lack common sense as well as training.
Since, the salt levels were low in the sandwich, requested for salt at the counter, to which the staff said it was unavailable and whether they could serve Mustard sauce instead. I was LIKE WHAT?! Mustard sauce is not a SUBSTITUTE to salt!
- Kindly, keep provisions for salt & pepper.
Thereafter, I asked them to serve the mustard sauce as I love it along with my sandwich which came in a PAPER CUP!! HOW IS A CUSTOMER SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT ALONG THE SANDWICH? Serve it in a dip bowl instead.
I put this point forward to the steward, who replied that since they were a takeaway counter, the dip bowl was unavailable. A complete turnoff. 
- Since your outlet has a seating arrangement, it would be kind enough if disposal dip bowls are kept.

About the SERVICE, was prompt.
PRICES were found to be reasonable.

Overall was an average experience.
- Would have given it a three and a half star rating with respect to food, but, thanks to the great conversation with the staff, deduction.

Review: Cafeccino 

Located in the basement, it is a cozy little coffee shop where one can stop by for a quite sip and bite. The offerings range from a selection of pastries, muffins etc to beverages, hot or cold. The portions are generous and the pricing reasonable, providing good value for money. The Chocolate Chip Muffins are perfectly soft and moist on the inside while crispy on the outside and surely one of the best served in town. It goes quite well with the cappuccino, which in turn is enjoyable. The Chicken Tikka Sandwich is a pleasing combination of spicy and tangy which makes it absolutely delicious, and a must have. The Blueberry Cheesecake is light, airy and has a pleasant aftertaste. The service is swift and the staff are courteous, making one feel like coming back again and again.

This cafe joint is located in basement 2 of quest mall just opposite spencers hyper. It is a moderately small outlet. Having around 3-4 tables, but it has got a artistic and lively decor. Offerings are pretty much the same as other cafes in the town offers ranging from iced coffee drinks like-cappuccino, frappe, mocha etc with your choice of toppings, iced tea of different flavor, hot coffees like- cafe latt√©, mocha, americano, cappuccino etc; hot chocolates, caramels etc. Then chilled offerings ranging from juices, shakes, sodas and smoothies. Different varieties of succumbing pastries, cheesecakes, muffins etc. So if you wanna catch a breathe while shopping your groceries in spencers then "Cafeeccino" is an ideal place to stop by and have your preferable beverage.

I and two of my friends went to meet at quest mall after a long time and we found out this caf√© joint at the basement. The awesome aroma of freshly ground coffee beans attracted us. We ordered hot cappuccino, iced cappuccino frap√® and chocolate pastry. I loved all of them and specially the pastry. The size of the pastry is pretty large and very soft,well decorated with chocolate flakes. Service is fast but the price of the coffee and other beverages is quite high compared to its quality whereas the price of cakes and pastries are reasonable. One visit will be sufficient.

The first time i happened onto this place was during a visit to starmark(quest mall, -1 level)...my stomach was making those all-too-familiar rumbling noises and spotting an inviting array of goods on display,i stepped in here..i ordered a muffin which was extremely fresh...it was soft and had an enticing aroma...and it did wonders wen i bit in...
i remember the cafe was pretty empty that one time,but ever since,iv always found it teeming....and i have been there quite a few times...
Decor wise,a few scattered orange chairs against a wooden backdrop..a small display...limited menu..not much really...it makes it difficult to pinpoint what actually draws everyone there...for me, it is like a peaceful nook amidst a bustling noisy mall...i can sit here for hours with a book,undisturbed...with my favorite hazelnut frappe of course...the coffee here is just the way i like it,strong but not overpowering,with subtle add on flavours...BLISS!!
On my next visits,iv tried their sandwiches...roasted chixken,hawaiian coleslaw,apinach corn...all r equally tasty and quantity wise great...they r very generous with the filling i must say...
I also adore their blueberry cheesecake...
 Moreover,prices are pretty reasonable compared to most other outlets in this "luxury" mall....
I would suggest u all try this quaint understated joint ..its totally worth it. 

P.S. i havent tried it myself,but my bro 
vouches for their dutch truffle pastry !!

The order was a chicken tikka sandwich, a mango shake, and a cold coffee shake with caramel flavor as add-on. The sandwich was definitely good and so were the shakeso. The bill read ‚Çπ480. A good place to fill yourself after a shopping spree, albeit at a steep price. The service is prompt but the staff forgot about my request for drinking water - not acceptable since the place hardly sees footfalls.

I havent actually visited the cafeccino located in ballygunge, but i did visit the one in the airport and the waiter told me that the food arrives everyday from their ballygunge outlet.
And since there is no zomato page for the airport joint i though of leaving my thoughts here.
The decor of the place was extremely well done and modern looking with a nice wooden floor and some quirky architecture so full marks to them on the ambience. 
The staff were polite and helpful but the food wasn't exactly something that i would keep coming back for, it ranged between average and good. I tried the roast chicken sandwich and a chicken shawarama roll, both were pretty ok and were quite fresh, i also had a cappucino which was pretty normal. Nothing much more to write about, prices were a little steep, but i think that is because of it being inside the airport and because of the airport taxes.
P.S: The new kolkata airport is super huge and super clean, its totally state of the art and cant be even compared to the airports in Iran and Kuwait, so good job (WB govt !)

After a filling lunch at the Quest Mall food court, my friend and I felt like some hot coffee. We noticed this attractive little joint tucked away on the lower floor near Spencer's. The confectioneries set out looked really appetising, but we were completely full and just ordered one cappuccino to share. They have bright red chairs to sit on, with pleasant music playing in the background. Our order came in a fairly large paper cup and looked quite nice. We took a sip, and then...then came the shock. The coffee was totally bland and tasted just like frothy milk with a bitter aftertaste! No amount of brown sugar could bring out even the slightest vestige of coffee flavour! We were quite annoyed and left most of the so-called cappuccino in the cup. 
This was really a disappointing experience for us. I suppose it's not a very fair review as I haven't tasted their bakery products and they did honestly look amazing. But after all, a coffee shop is supposed to serve good coffee first and foremost, and that didn't happen! Maybe it was a fluke, but it definitely lowered my opinion of them.
I will probably come back to sample the food, but I'll make sure to fix my caffeine craving elsewhere.

Just happened to stumble upon this sweet little joint last time when i visited spencers and was instantly craving a pineapple pastry . IT was moist and fresh. ( a rare for pineapple pastry these days ) . 

The other day had gone to spencers again and had not eaten breakfast, So I grabbed a roasted chicken sandwich and a black coffee and notices that the place was very nicely done up in shades of brown and the orange chairs added the necessary shot of color. 

coming to the coffee, it was nice and served well as far as the sandwich goes i liked the fact that no oil or butter had been used for grilling , I am cool with that but not sure many will like it . The sandwich was delicious and the portion size was decent . 

the person at the counter was pleasant and courteous. Will be  back again for more :) 

p.s. The muffins looks very inviting

Just happened to drop in for a cup of coffee when shopping at Quest. This outlet is just opposite the entry to Spencers, in the basement of Quest Mall.

The place comprises of a long counter with assorted pastries and savouries (limited range), and their coffee machine. In front there are about 4-6 tables with chairs. The staff are friendly and helpful. I found out it is part of a small chain, their other outlet being at Bombay airport.

We ordered for two coffees (they come in two sizes). Nice and well worth the money (about 60 rupees each) With that we ordered the recommended Dutch Chocolate Truffle pastry which was rather nice and their Aloo Chop (Bengali style, 2 for Rs 30). Nice once again and very reasonably priced. They also had Mochar Chop.

Entire meal came to about Rs 250. Not cheap, but not bad compared to some other Places. Also, another appreciable feature is the prices marked on the items and on the price list are inclusive of taxes.
