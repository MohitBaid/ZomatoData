Ok so as a road side food corner it's good. The food tastes good. The quality and quantity are satisfying. But the main problems are the behavior of the stuffs and the prices are too much for a food corner like this.

Had taken percel many times. Tried their gravy chow, rolls n rice items. Quality is ok type but quantity should better. Popular among local people. Easy to locate. As such seating arrangement is not there so basically it's a take away food joint.

Its food üç¥ is good very tasty üòã.
Even they provide lots of variety within no time, Just like a fast food centre should.
They stand out in fast food business and home delivery.
The only disadvantage is price is a little high .
Come-on who pays ‚Çπ40 for a chicken roll in Kolkata

5 mins away from my home. Recently ordered crispy chicken and babycorn. Both the dishes were absolute flop. It seems their secret ingredients are salt and oil. Rolls are the only face saver.

A takeaway joint basically. Rolls are okay, but too oily. Fish fry is genuinely good. The double egg double chicken roll is my favourite. Prompt service.

Food: 3/5
Price: ‚Çπ

Food quality is not dat good
Except rolls , which turned quite good. Fish fry is also good. Other than all this it is just a normal fast food centre.

Just 2-3 min walking distance from my place and we often ordered from them. Chicken roll, fish fry, chicken pakora are the best. Once I ordered crispy chilli baby corn bt its flop. Overall its very good

Location : Near Kayal Brothers Sweets,  Kankurgachi 

Ambiance : Just a Fast Food Outlet !! 

Food : This place opened up quite a while ago in our locality and hasn't put it's shutters down just yet :P !! 
             Anyway Jokes apart , ordered some Fish Diamond Frys and the Veg. Fried Rice for a quick evening meal. The Fish Fry was piping hot and so was the Rice even after taking it home, which was a good sign. The Fish Diamond Fry was very well done. Golden in colour and with a thick layer of "Bhetki" fish inside , it was quite divine. Quality spot on. The amount of the Veg. Fried Rice was also adequate. Simple and tasty although the oil content was a tad on the higher side. 

Pros : Price, Quality, Quantity, Prompt Service.
Cons: Not all the items stay available !! 

Cost for 2 : 250/-

Final Conclusion : Quite a good joint for Snacks and other low key items. Was highly satisfied with both my Dishes . Prices are Economical and Quality is nothing to complain about.
