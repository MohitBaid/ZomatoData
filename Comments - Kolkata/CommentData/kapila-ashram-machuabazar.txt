The legendary 108 years old well known sorbet and cake maker in north kolkata. The place is Much shabby but the food stuff is authentic and testy. But people who for many years of having this sorbet will agree that the test is not like before anymore though Their cake is highly demanding on Christmas and new year. Must try to come here to have the experience of the heritage and nostalgia of this place.
Ps: worth to buy raw Syrup bottles

The uniqueness of this place is they serve what they have prepared for that day, not what you want, but that doesn't matter because whatever they offer it's certainly delightful... the sherbet is kept chilled by putting it in earthen pots like old days, not adding ice which makes it better... For me it's the best in Kolkata...

One of the legendary sorbet makers in Kolkata, this shop has been there for the past 100 years! The essence used in making the sorbet is made in-house. The pineapple sorbet is a must try.

This is one of the legendary places of this city. Their menu is a bit weird. Sharbat, patties (veg and chicken) and fruit cake. Have never tried the patties and cakes, but have heard the fruit cake is quite famous. Also one day while drinking heard a gentleman placing an order for 50 pieces of patties. So, chances are high they will be good. Will be trying them on my next visit.

Coming to their most famous item, the gholer sharbat, you need to be bit lucky here. They don't make the sharbats as per order. So you won't be able to choose the flavours. Whatever is available at the time of your visit, you will have to order that. So you might end up with a glass, whose flavour you don't like.  If the flavour is your favourite you will definitely come back for more. They taste really good.

Avoid if you are a hygiene freak. If not, order a glass of sharbat when you are nearby.

A tradition well heard from my father and grand father which literally dragged me to this place. "100years at your service"- a place you wont even recognise to be a  sorbot outlet unless you have really heard about its heritage. I had the mango sorbot, it was pretty good though I was more impressed and interested watching the man making the sorbot with  the same old primitve method. A place worth visit not just to review but definitely to get the taste of "old calcutta".

"100 years at your service " is how the nameplate on top introduces the shop.

The sharbat shop has two parts – one serves hand churned dahi based drinks & the other serves syrup & water based drinks. Renowned sherbets are generally 3 kinds of drink – Kesar Malai, Rose Malai & Abar Khai (meaning ‘I want to have it again’). The syrups r made from fruits by these people & then mixed with water or soda b4 serving. They had about 10 types of sharbats in this section. This place is over 100 years old! and this is the only place in north Kolkata which can give the Paramount a tough competition when it comes to delicious and refreshing Sherbats!

Apart from that they sell fruit cake! The most surprising thing is the demand for cakes of this shop during Christmas. People literally stands in a queue and wait long for their turn. The fruit cakes are really delicious!

Just Awesome. Rs 30 for a glass is very reasonable. But they are not making the Chocolate Sherbat any more. I visit regularly. Paramount / Kapila - CCD will be soon out of business if these 2 opened franchises everywhere.

Thought of visiting this place for a long time.
Saw huge crowds and ques outside this small shop.
Finally, visited it. But i wasn't satisfied enough by the Kesar Malai. It was thin and not cool enough.
Still, its a very old shop and it was quite exciting to try it out.

I have came to know about this sherbet counter from Zomato. The photos of the shop didnot impressed me at all at first. But, being amazed by its superb rating, I planned to visit there. This is a very small, hard to notice shop, situated at the crossing of Kailash Bose Street and Bidhan Sarani, opposite Bombey Dyeing. The age of the shop is over 100 years. They serve traditional bangali style ghol sherbet. They still maintain the age old reciepe for it. They dont use fridge, instead, they use large ice cube in there stock "ghol" to keep them cool. And they prepare the sherbet freshly by mixing the "essence water" with "ghol" in a "lota". I was amazed by the taste of such simple preparation. The only downside is they offer only one varity each day, the varity changes everyday though. I bet that if the shopkeeper advertise themselves a bit, modernise the look of the shop and make the varities available everyday, they can surely bet 'Paramount' which is the at present best sherbet counter of kolkata

I have heard of this place for a thousand times since my childhood as my mom and dad used to come here when they were dating each other in college. This is a place older than 110 years serving varieties of shakes and sherbets. They remain closed during winters since the last week of November and opens on the day of Saraswati Pujo. As we went just two days after their summer opening, they only had the Kesar Malai. I had no other options than this. So we went for it. The malai was basically a Lassi, with added colours. The flavour was refreshing and it was dense yet smooth. They have a very unique method of making it using buckets and other oversized containers and equipments. As mentioned in other reviews, I am pretty sure that their Abar Khai is also very good, as pointed by the guy at the shop also. I deducted the points for not having only one options available but I hope to come here back again to try other varieties of this century old institutional sherbet centre. Don't come here for any lavish experience. Come here to experience the heritage and history of this place. Happy Dining! :)

One of the most terrible unhygienic places to exist ever. Although it has a 100year tag with it's name still the method of preparations are horrifying when you consider how important food safety & hygiene is in today's world.

The sherbet counter is located opposote the bombay dyeing store on bidhan sarani. The place is so small that you hardly notice its existence unless you are aware of its legendary presence . "100 years at your service " is how the nameplate on top introduces the shop. The interior of the shop basically looks like a dingy sooted kitchen. There is no seating available and one has to stand and drink. The only products available are kesar malai , rose malai , and abar khabo . Apart from that they sell fruit cake ! After waiting for about five minutes watching the kesar malai drink being made , I tasted the thick milky frothy drink priced at just rupees 30 ! The abar khabo drink is greenish in tinge and has the same base as the kesar malai but different flavour.

Undoubtedly the best place for sherbat in kolkata. Try out every possible flavour and you will love them. The item "ABAR KHAI" will really make you order another glass. But to me the most surprising thing was the demand for cakes of this shop during christmas. People literally stands in a que and wait long for their turn. The fruit cakes are really delicious!

This place is over 100 years old! and this is the only place in north Kolkata which can give the Paramount a tough competition when it comes to delicious and refreshing sherbats! If you could manage to discover this place (because it would take some serious effort to find this place believe me!!!).Its a very small,virtually unnoticeable stall! On our way to college street everytime we would try whatever flavour was available at that time.Yes they would prepare a particular flavour of sherbat on a day.So you have to be lucky enough to taste all the different flavours because it may happen that you may get to taste the same flavour on consecutive days of your visit.

The best place for sharbat in Kolkata. may be not too many people are aware of it, that's because their publicity is very less, the shop is quite little (though it is placed over there more than 100 years). The owner and his family drive the shop, placed in Srimani market, maniktala. but regarding taste of sharbat, no one can cross their benchmark right now in kolkata. i have tried malai sharbat of rose, keshar, mango, banana, lichi flavours over here. the taste and quantity are superb. u can try 2 or 3 glasses for a complete stomach. they also sell syrups indivisually to prepare in home. 
their only problem is everyday you cannot taste all the options. since they have very less head count, so one time they prepare maximun 2 to 3 types of sharbat. even considering this, i would say if someone hasn't visit it yet, he/she hasn't got the taste of heritage Kolkata...

The 3.5 rating for this old is gold sherbat parlour is just because of its sheer quality. The place carries a legacy of more than 100 years and its a favrt spot of old "city of joy". By its current looks it may not be impressive to some but it resembles part of North Calcutta which I personally like. But when comes to the sherbats Kapila Ashram is nothing short of quality n consistency. A strong competition to Paramount this oldie may not have that many variety but whatever they serve are at per. I had their kacha aam pudina sherbat and it was yummy n really tasty. Rest of their famous items are- rose syrup, green mango syrup, choco malai.

Why not more than 3.5- probably the place should be a bit rennovated and the list of sherbats a bit varied :) 

P.S: They have raw syrups bottled for sale that r worth to buy to have at home
