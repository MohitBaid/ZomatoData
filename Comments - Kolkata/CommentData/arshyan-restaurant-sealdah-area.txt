This restaurant serves very good food. I order food weekly twice fron last six months. The delivery is always on time. One must try delicious food from here. The food is quite reasonable where people can afford easily....ðŸ‘Œ

I request the restaurant authority to introduce most of the items that is mentioned in the menu card provided in Zomate. 
I give 5 star for this restaurant .... What about you ? ðŸ˜Š

It's a no beef restaurant at Rajabazar crossing, famous for all type kabab's & tandoor. Anyone can do dinner within budget-value for money. Sitting is not so great with family.

Though I have not visited Arshyan, which is at the four crossing of Rajabazar, but biryani with egg is now a days very rare and have enjoyed it.

The taste is good and "Laziz".
Hope Arshyan will continue the same with much tatse and continue with EGG ðŸ˜ƒ

At Rajabazar mostly you will find lots of Beef Biryani shops. Thankfully Arshyan located at Rajabazar crossing is one of the very few restaurant serving No Beef.

Its a very basic place with basic dining & sitting arrangements. I found no people having their dinner over here. Unfortunately I made the mistake to parcel my dinner from here.

Chicken Biryani (1.5/5): Just after opening the box I found the rice of questionable quality but it was rich on color. There was 2 small sized chicken pieces better to say more bones, half of an boiled egg, a big stale potato & lots of tamarind with seeds inside. Chicken pieces were pure joke with very less chicken stick to the bones, that also with no tasted at all. Potato was soft cooked but tangy to taste, seemed stale to me. With the half of an egg I also found two small gram flour fried balls with chillies inside & didn't understood actually what was it. Too much tamarind on the other hand compleatly removed the flavour of Biryani also ruined the taste of it. Taste wise it was hot, unnecessary spicy, bit oily & no pleasure to mouth. The quantity was below average to fill my tummy.

It has became a trend now to mess around with the name of Arsalan and open a new restaurant. As result there are many duplicate Arsalan spreading in the lanes of Kolkata. Where a plate of Chicken Biryani at Arsalan costs Rs.190 they serve it for Rs.130. There comes the final question...
Is it worth it?
I don't think so!
