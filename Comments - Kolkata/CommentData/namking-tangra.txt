A highly pocket friendly place,with comparison with Big Boss,Beijing.....like restaurants.
This backward area of China Town is kind of a nostalgic place.It is still a Chinese colony.
Restaurants here are their main source of income.
Coming to service and quality,they maintain an average,but again not so overwhelming.not extraordinary.
Good place for young guys and groups for a pocket friendly get together with drinks.
Drums of heaven and schezwan mixed rice is the best of the lot here.
Not the safest place to hangout with ladies.

Very spacious and laid back kind of place. Staff is good just little conservative while serving the complimentary Chaknas. Service is again lighting fast. Very pocket friendly. Only problem is that I can't take the gravy chowmeins unlike others.

REALLY SURPRISED AFTER READING ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS. CHEAPEST PLACE WITH BEST FOOD.

* Location : Chinatown, kolkata. But somehow difficult to find the place as the restaurant is not very well known. 

* Ambience : Not very catchy, not very decorated, but you would love the warmth of the staffs and very comfortable chairs n tables with large sofas. Very comfy ambience for ADDA TIME with friends (rating 7 on 10).

* Food :      1. Price of drinks are honestly cheapest. I ve tried many Chinatown bars, never I found this much cheap normal alcohol. Don't expect special cocktails or expensive scotch here cz this place is for ALCOHOL LOVERS IN CHEAPEST RATE. (rating 10 on 10)
                  2. Special Namking chicken is my hot favorite here, every time I go, I order it and every Chinese food lovers must take their signature item as a starter with or without alcohol. Awesome taste, lipsmacking,beautifully cooked. (rating 10 on 10)
                  3. Mixed Fried rice is a special mention for the big pieces of prawn. Prawn lovers will like it. The quantity and quality of the rice @ that cheaper rate is quite amazing. Very good taste, sufficient for a couple. (rating 8 on 10)
                 4. As I m very much sweet lover, so I prefer their Sweet n Sour chicken most of the time. The proportion of sweet and sour in that item is perfect,not too sweet,not too sour. And the veggies are fresh and well cooked. (rating 8 on 10l
                 5. Manchurian chicken is also worth mentioned. (rating 8 on 10)

* Price : I ve already mentioned that price is amazing compared to the quantity and quality of some Chinese items.

* Management : Every time I visit, I am thoroughly appreciated. The staffs are so cooperative with the new comers,guide them rightly what to take or what not. Its a family restaurant also. So, either you take alcohol or not,no matter,they will guide you professionally. (rating 9 on 10)

* Why recommended : 1. For cheapest alcohol in Chinatown. I recommend you to take bottles instead of pegs,bottles are cheaper.
             2. Very well cooked Chinese items, Especially Namking special chicken.

I really feel sorry for them who wrote negative reviews. My personal experience is very good every time.

My best experience in China town(tangra).  Excellent homely ambience as the owners take care of every thing. Well mannered and helpful staff. Every dish suggested by them was literally lip-smacking. Ample parking space is an added advantage. Only the sound of central AC is the minus point but ignorable. A must visit for every Chinese food lovers.

their drums of heaven is very good................. But we ordered chicken fried rice which was not at all good to taste for eating......... A smoked flavour was there.......... apart from their chicken fried rice rest of the items were very beautiful........ We also ordered chickenn manchurian .. chili fish........... which was good to taste....... Pocket friendly......... At a glance good restaurant  for family dine in and also for drinkers......
