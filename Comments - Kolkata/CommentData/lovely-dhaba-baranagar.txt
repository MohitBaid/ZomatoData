ordered 3times online through zomato..food is average and worth the price they charge.No tax is added.Chana masala was not properly made.Gravy chowmein was good and amount was in excess.but recently ordered biryani..which is not at all good.The essence or kewra water is applied in excess which made us unable to eat

Located on the way towards dakhineswar from dunlop, just before omkarnath temple. It offers a wide variety of dishes, mainly Chinese and mughlai. I have been there a lots of tym. Liked their Chinese dishes. The waiters are good but takes a little bit of time to serve. The interior is not so finely cleaned-the spoons are often spoiled. The taste is good but nothing special about it. I would say it is just an ordinary food centre and if you ever visit there do not put a great expectation for it. Ideal for little snacks from a roadside food stall.

Never got the delivery. Waited for 3 hours but the food never came. Worst place every to order from. Not recommended at all. Very bad on the resturants part, could have informed that the food wasn't going to come.
