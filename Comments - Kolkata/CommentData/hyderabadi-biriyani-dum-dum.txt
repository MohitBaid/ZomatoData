It is an extremely small joint with very less seats. The price is quite pocket friendly and service is fast. Tried chicken biryani which was way too oily and taste was okay. Wouldn't recommend the place.

An average eatery at Dum Dum .

No sitting arrangements, quick service.

Took hyderabadi chicken biriyani , quantity was good but quality was average, oily , aromatic . Could cater the need of local people , but people who goes Arsalan , Aminia etc would not like this for sure.

Pocket pinch is reasonable .

Very mediocre experience.

সম্পূর্ণ ভাবেই রাস্তার খাবার । নামেই হায়দ্রাবাদি বিরিয়ানি । আসলে কাউয়া বিরিয়ানি ব্যতীত আলাদা কিছু নয় । খাবার উপায় বাড়ি বসে । স্বাদ অতি সাধারণ , তেলযুক্ত ।

The biriyani is good and they recently added a lot of new things in there menu.The quantity of there food is good but they should have more places to sit inside.

Being a biriyani lover could not resist to check out this 'biriyani outlet' . Bad quality .The biriyani had the right aroma but not the taste .Don't waste ur pocket here .

They used to serve good biryani when they started but with time they have detoriated a lot. The biryani price is moderate. It could do with a better sized piece also.

It's located in between hanuman mandir and Ghosh para. The biryani is very different from our Kolkata biryani but I didn't like it very much,but it's okay. But still if you want to try something different, go there once.

This place used to be a cake shop then it turned into a biriyani shop. It had been many days since I had hydrebadi biriyani so I decided to give this place a go and it dis not dissapoint. The taste was different. They gave raita and chutney with their biriyani which I liked eating with the rice. It even had 2 pieces of chicken though not big.
After a few days the shop closed its shutters but a couple of days back it reopened to sell a variety of items starting from biriyani to Chinese dishes but the quality of the biriyani had degraded a lot. It did not taste like it used to. Sad!
