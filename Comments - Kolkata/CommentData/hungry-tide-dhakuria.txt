A tiny outlet situated in the lanes of Selimpur, having seating arrangements for 10-15 people. I have always opted for take away. I ordered:

1. Bacon wrapped chicken: six tender pieces of chicken wrapped with bacon and served with cheese dip.

2. Chicken and mushroom appasionata: rice cooked with butter along with capsicum and served with cheese sauce

3. Chilli pork: this is the best chilli pork I have ever had. It is perfectly cooked and tastes great.

All the dishes are amazing. I hope they come up with a bigger space and also put up an air conditioner otherwise it becomes extremely difficult during summer. This is the only reason I am deducting .5 .
Service is pretty quick. Highly recommended place.

Affordable and cozy.

A garage-turned-restaurant, this one lacks air conditioning, but that wasn't much of an issue as we visited in December.

One thing that impressed me is that they don't compromise with quality. The pork pieces were fresh and succulent and well cooked.

We ordered the baked ham and chicken and the Malbari pork. Very different dishes, but both were pretty good on their own.
The baked ham and pork was well baked and had just the right amount of cheese on top. The meat was evenly spread and every spoonful had a sufficient balance between the pork and the cheese.
The Malbari pork was not surprisingly, very spicy. Served with three parathas (made from atta, not maida) and a sweet homemade chutney, the heat from the curry perfectly complemented the taste of the chutney.

The cooking felt surprisingly "homemade", for some reason that I don't fully understand. But that was a plus for me.

The space is a little cramped and the seating could be made a bit more comfortable, but overall, we liked the food.

Ordered club sandwich from Swiggy. Not sure from which outlet it was delivered. But believe me the worst sandwich it was at such high rate. It was cold and the breads were so hard. Instead of French fries provided 1 small packet of lays.

Not to be recommend ever!!

Went there during Durga Puja with friends, wasn't disappointed. The location is very convenient. Must try the bacon wrapped prawns with cheese dip. It's absolutely amazing! My friends had combos and the lady who took our order suggested me to try the carbonara. The carbonara was super cheesy and I guess it had bacon in it. Great quantity, great quality, amazing taste! A big thumbs up to this place! Will definitely visit again!

3. Their mutton Shepherd's Pie is love.  Give it a try.
4. They have started making Crab cakes.  It is served with some spicy mayonnaise.  It is okayish. 
They have a loads of other baked items which is hard to find in other places.  Try them and i am sure you wont regret it.  Always homely feelings with super yum food

Tasty chinese food at pocket friendly price. It is one of the favorite home delivery options. We ordered combo-veg chowmin and garlic chicken, and a chilli chicken. The delivery was quick despite the rainy weather. The garlic chicken was delicious. Chowmin tasted good too. All the Food items were hot and tasty. They were also non-oily and MSG free. Quantities were less though .

The rice dishes are simply excellent, and the meat platter is fit for a king. There is great vatiety, and although some of the dishes might be a little expensive, they are certainly worth it. For those seeking affordable food, their rice/noodles combo offers are cheap, tasty, and have enough food for one person.

Ravenous stream!

That's what they call it here though in different words. And we felt the same too. Thus, this time chose to fulfill our Hungry stomach with the given Tide of the restaurant. 

Day was Saptami. (And that's how we count during Pujo, these days we don't follow the calendar). We had a plan to visit the pandals near Jodhpur Park, and after the plan was executed, we went for the near by place to dine in. They don't have a proper restaurant kind of ambience. They have a big tent including proper sitting arrangements, at first it will seem like that you might have come for some marriage ceremony. Nevertheless, their food are marvellous. As all were peckish, so we enacted quick for Bacon wrapped chicken, which was proper heaven; and Mongolian crunchy chilli pork, which didn't last for long as all were famished. And for main course our choices were: Ham, Bacon and Chicken club sandwich, which can make you full by the one piece of it. Though they provide two big pieces with chips. However, other choices were mixed grill from continental main course, which was bit humongous but you will like it; other were Mutton hamburger steak, chicken steak with mushroom sauce and egg chicken fried rice. All were appetizing in taste. And it fetched very friendly price, just 350 each.

Therefore, I would suggest you this place if you are looking for continental or something different in taste.

Hungry Tide was in the wishlist for long, based on the review in zomato. This outlet is pretty small, but we opted for a home delivery. So, basically this review is totally based on the taste of the food. We mainly ordered some continental dish , the look and presentation has a quite big role in any kind of food, and even more for continental. So, it was not there obviously, as it was a home delivery.

So, let's quickly jumped to the food and experience we had.

‚úì Lemon Coriander Chicken Soup : it's quite good. Proper portion of chicken pieces. Would not say that was mind-blowing but pretty good.

‚úì Baked Fish and Prawn : this was owsum. One of the excellent dish they offer. prawn and bhetki fish with cheese baked and it tasted just heavenly.

‚úì Paella : this is a Spanish dish. A complete dish I would say. Where you have the mix of rice with other ingredients. And we took the mix of Chicken sausage, Chicken, prawn. The quantity is more than sufficient for two. And it is excellent one.

‚úì Chicken in BBQ sauce : Six pieces of chicken server with boiled vegetables and sauce. It was a bit oily. But I loved the taste. It was very nice.

‚úì Grilled Fish with choice of sauce : the served the bhetki , with books vegetables and fries. And we took the lemon butter sauce. Honestly speaking we did not able to taste the whole thing properly, as for the home delivery- the did not mixed the sauce with the fish.  Seperately thing were nice- but I felt it would taste even better to have it in their outlet even.

All that cost 1340 for 3 heads.

This review is on the home delivery food. I wish to visit their outlet once for sure, to taste it with little more perfection.

Note: The pictures is of the home delivery food. So, you may find difficult to understand the dishes.

Very small outlet. No AC, a low lying roof with only small fixed fans on the walls to cool you off.With the kind of weather here in Kolkata it definitely gets tough especially when you are planning to chill out with friends.But believe me this place even though has a few shortcomings yet it doesnt score bad as much as the food is concerned.I just love their combos and probably i have tried all there dishes and yes they all are good and are definitely worth a try. Do give it a try coz im sure you will come back again.

This place offers good food in an affordable price. I personally prefer the all-meat sandwich which comes with various extra add-on sauces of which spicy mayo is to die for. Also, they serve amazing pork dishes, can't select a favorite. Since the Dhakuria outlet is quite small, takeaways or online orders are preferably convenient. Great place to treat friends, less price great food. 
In picture: Too lazy to go out, Swiggy provides excellent service and my sandwich with spicy mayo and cheese sauce arrives in 30 minutes. ‚ô•Ô∏è

The food from the dhakuria joint is a blessing for all lovers of continental and chinese cusine..Been ordering for years and this place consistently delivers some tasty food..Try their deep fried rice(request them for your choice of ingredients, which they usually accept), it is unique and tasty. Their chinese offering is also authentic and tasty. I have tried their mamabari mutton which is also quiet a treat. Their combo meals are also value for money and good to eat. Their staff,who take orders over phone are very accommodating and usually accept any special request. Hoping to order soon again.

Few days ago we went to hungry tide to have some continental food for the 1st time, and were waiting for the foods to get into our stomach. The restaurant or quick bites allow us to sit with only handful of 6-8 people, as it is quite small. We ordered mixed grill and chicken stroganoff, and were pretty eager to taste the food.. The service was quite prompt without wasting any time they served chicken stroganoff 1st and then the mixed grill. The chicken dish of chicken stroganoff was very delicious and a hatke taste which we loved but the herb rice with it was not that good, my g.f found it smelly. Coming to the mixed grill, which comprises of mutton,chicken, bacon, ham, sausages with fried egg and hash brown, was looking beautifully plated, but i had only chicken,few bites of bacon, fried egg and part of mutton & hash brown, as we were having continental for the 1st time, so we didn't find it tasty at all only the food which we know was eaten by us, it was a horrible incident, i was kind of vomitting at that time after having and seeing so much of meat, so most of the food got wasted as we only had the chicken stroganoff. Last but not the least the restro authority was also very helpful, and they insisted us to take the food by parcel, but we were so sick at that time that we didn't want to carry that luggage. After that incident i made up my mind that we will not have continental main course from next time onwards, as we are not habituated with this kind of food stuff.

'Hungry Tide' has been quiet popular for a while in Kolkata for their delicious chineae food items. After a movie with friends we came here on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed at all.

'Hungry Tide' is located in an alley just oppositr to the HDFC bank in Dhakuria. The restauarant was a small one,with provisions for the seating of 10-12 people. 

We ordered three 'Schezwan Chicken,egg fried rice' and one 'Schezwan Pork,egg fried rice combos'.The food came within seven minutes. The schezwan chicken and fried rice combo was delicious.It was filling as well. My friemd rated the 'Schezwan pork' highly as well.

The staff was well-behaved and amiable.I will definitely visit again.

If you don't want to cook at home and want to eat home made rice sprinkled with left over mushrooms and uncooked chicken then Hungry Tide is the place for you. Not only will they fulfill all the above requirements but also give it a fancy name like 'Chicken and mushroom RISOTTO'. Google says 
"Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked in a broth to a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, wine, and onion."
But just eliminate the cream and cheese or broth part and Hungry Tide has most low grade risotto for you. A place that has been one of my favourites has totally lost my trust now with the most pathetic dish I have ever tasted.
Hungry Ride's Risotto = uncooked chicken + stale mushroom + some rice 
Third grade, low quality, extreme disappointment and total waste of money. Disgusting is a small word for this dish.
Dear Hungry Tide why don't Google before naming a dish, might save your respect a little.

I mean I've to stop trusting zomato and it's rating. Horrible experience. I saw the reviews and decided to give a visit to this place. I saw the menu chart over here on zomato and I was jumping. My favourite stuff on the menu. But oh well when I reached here half drenched few hours ago. I was literally hungry. Ordered for sandwich which was really good. But the mixed fried rice and the hunan Chicken was disastrous. So was the crispy babycorns. I had to pack it and bring it home. My mother just had it and yelled at me for wasting money. 

Don't get easily fooled by zomato ratings. Zomato sucks!

Hungry Tide located very close to my residence is a great option when you want to order in. Good value for money and portion size and delivery times are quick as I am located very close by. I have tried the Chinese staples. We ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles , Chilli Chicken and Golden Fried Prawns. The prawns did not excite me and I would not reorder but the Chilli Chicken and Hakka Noodles were quite nice , typical Kolkata Chinese. However the dish that has become a firm favorite in our home is the Malabari Pork which is served with 3 homemade Paratha's and some Chutney. We have ordered it repeatedly in the last few months and it never fails to satisfy us both in terms of quality and taste. If you like Pork then this is a dish worth trying but incase you don't they also have a mutton version which you can check out. The Mixed Grill and Continental dishes are also on my wishlist and I hope to try them out soon.

How this restaurant has such a high rating, beats me. The price is low, yes, but, the value for money is even lower.

Chicken Staganoff was under seasoned, bland and tasteless.

Meifoon seemed like it was cooked on a lazy Sunday afternoon, albeit, very generous with the salt. Whatever salt was less in the Stroganoff was well set off with the meifoon.

The chinese chicken dishes was slightly better than the other two disastrous items, but, I'll just give them 1/5, while the rest deserved 0.5/5.

Let me iterate, i am being generous in my review. The food was that bad. 

I did get a management response, however, who offered to deliver the dishes, again. If they are willing to act upon the customer dissatisfaction, and improve, I'll corporate. And, i give a higher rating because of that.

Maybe, I'll give this place another shot someday.

We ordered from this place via a food delivery website. We had ordered the prawn mixed hakka chow and teriyaki fish. The items were well prepared. The prices are very reasonable too. Looking forward to try the other dishes on their menu.

I have been to this amazing place twice. It is a takeaway with few seating arrangements but is a most sought after destination for foodies. ¬†The menu boasts of a beautiful blend of exotic and known fast food with a twist! This quirky yet yummy 'Pork Sekwa' was advised to me by this humble gentleman at the counter on first visit. A cold salad, this pork dish was awesome and one of the craziest food which i had in recent times.
Today on my second visit, I digged into this 'Baked Ham and Chicken'. Its a fabulous and tummy filling dish!¬†
It is a fairly busy takeaway with hospitable staff. However I would request the place to expand the seating arrangement if possible.

Not a very good experience. Had gone there with my partner last year and we ordered a ham and bacon fried rice with teriyaki chicken.
They had told us that the chicken dish would have eight pieces of chicken but what they got us was a dish made of shredded chicken. After we sent it back they hurriedly made another batch but this one was too salty. The rice was pretty oily too. I guess it was just a bad day maybe.

We've been a regular here, because of the kind of variety and quality of food. Even though it might not be such a great place to sit and have your meal, it's ideal for home deliveries, which they do at nominal prices. The people are really friendly and you can trust them to choose a delirious platter for you, even if you don't make much of their elaborate menu. Their stir fries and bakes are a must. We tried the Paella, Meifoon, with Pork Stir Fry, Coriander Fish an Chicken in Black Bean sauce, all or which was perfect for a group or five. The place is a budget steal, and a must try.

I tried the mixed meifoon fried rice with pork in oyster sauce.
The quantity was for two persons and the quality was also nice specially the rice.
Though the pork side dish was very good but it was a bit dry.

Ordered malbari pork from swiggy got some chicken dish instead, on another previous occasion i ordered a Shepherd's pie, size was too small and i was charged 20rs extra for container but food was packed in foil container no plastic container
Update- Manager personally called me back and assured me to send the two mentioned dishes again free of cost, very happy with the service!! He could have just offered a monetary refund but he went the extra step and offered to send a full dish again. It is very rare nowadays for food joints to rectify their mistakes, really appreciate the effort :)

Nothing not to love about Hungry Tide! Delicious,very cost-effective food. Club sandwiches are wonderful. So are some of their starters like drums of heaven, bacon wrapped prawns,golden fried chicken. Their pastas and risottos are average, but their diffried dishes(especially the pork ones) are outstanding. So is their paella-full-bodied and flavoursome. The green chilli chicken and Mongolian pork are worth a try. Their rice and gravy noodles are also tasty. They make a mean shepherd's pie as well. This place stands out for making amazing food, and providing exceptionally prompt service.

Hungry tide of the popular name among Teenagers for its delicious quick bite item. They has three brunches and all of them were only Take Away option. But few days ago when I came to know from one of my Foody friend that they had some little sitting arrangement at Dhakuria brunch, I hardly resist myself from taking a foodventure at this restaurant.

Location ‚Äì It is 5min walk from Jadavpur PS Bus stand towards Dhakuria. It actually located inside a small lane which is situated just opposite of Dominos‚Äô and besides of UBI Dhakuria Brunch. Easy to find.

Ambiance and Decoration ‚Äì When I first saw the restaurant I was quiet surprised to see that how they converted a garage into a restaurant. Love the concept. There is only two tables are there for Dine In and few chairs are there only for sitting. No such decorations are there but the restaurant is well maintained and you will get a homely feelings! Like it.

Stuffs and Management ‚Äì After taking a table, the person at the cash counter the menu card, which is really big in size, hahaha. He is very polite and very suggestive also. The lady, I guess she is one of owner of this restaurant is also friendly and co-operative. We asked to her about many things while we were having our food and she answered our each question with a big smile. That is where you get the homely touch. Brilliant.

Food ‚Äì It really takes a long time for us to decide what should we order. But after taking some help of Zomato, we ordered Golden Fried Chicken with Cheese Dip, Paella, Baked Fish with Prawn.

Golden Fried Chicken ‚Äì We ordered this one as an appetizer. There was nothing mentioned how many chicken will be there! But when the dish come to our table, we were kinda surprised to see that there were 10pieces good sized chicken pieces are there. Outer crust of the chicken were fried deeply and chispy in nature. The outer texture of the Chicken was so delicious that your mouth will fill in water in just one look. Cheese dip which is provided with it, is super tasty. It is so yummy that it let you liking your finger. Perfect partner with the chicken. Super recommended.

Paella ‚Äì Paella is mainly a Spanish dish and it was first time for me to try any Spanish dish, so was very curious about it. There are few variants available and we choose Chicken Sausage, Chicken, Prawn variant. The dish comes along with a chantney, which tastes little rough to me. But the rice is cooked in perfect way. Lots of capsicum and onions were there. The rice was cooked in a tangy sauce so a permanent tangy flavor always consist there. Big sized prawn, fine cut sausage and chicken pieces make the rice really a good one. The amount is enough for two persons. . Try this one, if you like the tangy flavored food.

Baked Fish with Prawn ‚Äì We ordered this one with help of some reviews on Zomato. The dish came in a Aluminum foil container. From a quick look,, the dish not seems too much special till you dip your spoon into it. The container was full of White sauce, Cheese and mayonnaise. The upper level is well baked and it tastes really good. Little crunchy upper crust and the molten cheese when enter in your mouth, it will melt automatically. Many big sized prawn pieces were there along with cutting fish pieces. Super duper. I wish I get this dish during rainy days. Believe me, it is just awesome..

With all the food mentioned above it cost only 930INR. No extra vat or Tax added. In conclusion it is undoubtly I can say that Hungry Tide is really a hidden gems for South Kolkata. I wish that, they open one of their brunch at North Kolkata. Great quality food @ affordable price without thinking about budget, I guess it is enough for a restaurant, to make it more popular than any other. I definitely come to this restaurant again and again.

This is a average to good eatery located in the by lane opposite to the Jodhpur Park post office. They have three outlets in the city. The taste varies hugely from one another. The one at Dhakuria is mainly a take away joint with seating arrangements for 6-8 people. It offers wide range of cuisines like Indian,Chinese , sandwiches and many more. But the continental and Italian section according to me is their USP. The dishes they offer against the prices charged makes them stand out from the crowd of take away joints. Chicken Stroganoff, Chicken Alfredo,Fish and Chips are notable ones. The chicken spicy mayo sandwich,chicken momo and egg chicken meinfoon are my favorites and i often get them parceled. If you are around Dhakuria or stay nearby I would suggest that you can definitely give it a try  and I suppose you wont regret it.

This has become one of my favourite stops of late. The size of the place, with only 5-6 chairs and 5 or 6 seats more can really be deceptive for the amazing continental food they serve. I have visited it on some occasions now, and have even got food delivered, and I have been rarely disappointed.

The signboard two alleys before Tandoor Park indicates the entrance to the place. One thing I probably should mention is how well versed the person at the desk is with the menu, and to some extent, even the preparation of the dishes. He will suggest you the best, and even tell you which particular ingredient might be a problem for you. That definitely gives a heads up!

They really have a lot of continental, indian and chinese dishes included in their long list of items. I have mostly tried the continental and so will review based on that only. 

Their Bacon Wrapped Chicken is an absolute delight with the dip served and is definitely recommended. 

Next comes the Chicken in Barbeque Sauce. This is another amazing dish and along with boiled vegetables and french fries, it's another dish for the chicken lovers.

I have tried their Chicken Stroganoff, and Chicken Parmigiana. The former is okayish, but I found the accompanying rice tasteless and the chicken a bit bland, even though it had generous quantities of both chicken and mushroom. The Parmigiana didn't suit my taste at all, since the cheese odour was too strong and the chicken too dry. I can't really complain since I had been warned about it before ordering!

Their home delivery service is pretty quick as well. They delivered my Chicken Tetrazzini and Ham, Bacon and spicy mayo Chicken Club Sandwich before time infact. The Tetrazzini was hot, but again I felt it was too creamy- to the extent if it forming large colloids. The sandwich fillings were great, but the bread wasn't grilled properly and I would appreciate it if they used better quality breads.

The best part about the place is undoubtedly the fact that the prices are tax inclusive. I am yet to come across a place that serves such good continental food at these prices. So, definitely recommended!!

We ordered noodles with garlic fish which was delicious. We also had herbed rice with chicken Stroganoff. It was a white sauce juicy dish with lots of mushrooms.
Overall nice experience and good servicehope they expand their dining space a bit.

The place is small but the food was AWESOME. We ordered Golden fried Chicken with cheese dip as starter. It costs Rs 260. It looked like Beguni. :D Taste was  great. Then we ordered Baked fish with prawns which costs Rs 320. This dish was awesome. If you love cheese you must must try this. And in main course we ordered a spanish dish Paella (Chicken sausage, chicken, prawns) which was served hot and it was a little bit spicy. Taste was different but liked it.

The food's so awesome I can't even begin to describe it. I took takeaway today and the packaging was great and so was the quantity. I ordered a butter garlic fish, broccoli and pork and mixed meifoon noodles. Everything was perfect and couldn't find a thing to complain about regarding the taste and quality of the food. The restaurant itself though isn't in the best shape and isn't very well maintained; there's not much seating space either. The owner was a little preoccupied and could be nicer to the guests. However, would definitely recommend for takeaway.

I went to this place yesterday evening.I visited the Hindustan park outlet before few times.The interiors,tables were done in bright yellow.They have sitting arrangements but very limited.
Tried the veg chow and chilli pork combo.The portion is more than enough given that it's a combo.The noodles was well cooked and had good seasoning on it.It wasn't oily.
Chilli pork was too good.The meat used was of premium quality and the meat:fat ratio was perfect.Pork was so tender that it was melting in the mouth.The sauce it was cooked it was so good..it wasn't typical spicy ones we get commonly.The sauce was sticky,spicy and sweet..such good flavours in it.

I deducted points solely for the serious space cramp.Otherwise food here is top notch.

I went to this place last week. I had Chi Ham Cheese squares, it was quite good. I liked it most! Then I tried ¬†Crevettes a la creme, this was white sauce with tiger prawns. This dish serves three. But the white sauce was not well mixed as lumps were found. But the taste wont disappoint you. Lastly I ordered Cantonese chow mein. It was also nice, and tasty. I wish this place could have more sitting arrangements.

Two of us visited The Hungry Tide a few days ago. Since the very limited seating space was occupied, we were asked to wait for around fifteen minutes. We went to run an errand, returned around fifteen minutes later and were immediately seated. While the tables were clean and there were enough condiments, it was clear that this place was more suitable as a takeaway point.

The menu has a wide range of main dishes. We ordered two variants of the Thai Green Curry (one with fish and the other vegetarian). We were served huge portions of the curry with an equally generous helping of rice. The curry was fairly spicy but very tasty, and the fish pieces were large and well-cooked. At the end, a lady who appeared to be one of the owners (and who also cooked the food)¬† kindly offered us a complimentary dessert - not from the menu, but some gajar ka halwa that she'd just finished making. It was a nice touch.

We liked the food there and would certainly go back again, and would welcome an increase in their seating space.

We are visiting Kolkata and my Mother in law told us about this little place with good food reviews...so since we were in the area we decided to take the kids and go sample some of the fare for lunch...we were three adults and two kids.  
When I said little...it really is little...two tables and some stools.  I think it is mainly a take out place...
Food was good...tasty....serving size large.  

We ordered two Shepard's pies , one baked fish , a spaghetti carbonara and a plate of golden fried prawns. .
Each dish was good.  Loads of white sauce, but tasty...
Prices are a bit steep if you sit there and eat ...in a garage....but other wise the food is tasty...

I recommend you try them out...order in though...they encourage it as well.

Hungry Tide has become a popular name among the foodies specially hovering over South Kolkata for the obvious reason of great food quality they serve. Have dropped in to their Dhakuria outlet for couple of times and every time their food ensures to satiate us fully. It's basically a takeaway with only 2 tables, so nothing much to mention about ambience and decor. Food is undoubtedly the show stealer here. At this place one can come across Pork Sekwa- a Sikkimese salad like cuisine with minced pork pieces garnished with mustard sauce and lemon which with it's tangy flavor is sure to take one's taste bud with pleasant surprise! The 3 tier sandwiches with bacon and ham is also good. The grilled chicken and drums of heaven are well prepared dishes with sufficient quantity which will also give a bang to your bucks. 
Overall quiet a recommended food joint. Considering a bigger sitting arrangement must be a foremost priority of the patrons.

My review is for their Home Delivery fare. Their standard of cooking is superb. Each of the dish order was cooked just right. Their fare tastes great and the portions are more than wholesome. For what they bill, they provide great value for money. The best part is, there are no hike ups on the menu amount in the final bill (by way of assorted taxes). The size of the (Jodhpur Park) outlet belies the actual quality of their fare, which could well give the more established, high brow restaurants a run for their money. Highly recommended.

Its a small joint. Can not accommodate more dan 10 people. Have had ordered , tetrazini chicken small,and risotto chickenMushroom. Both dishes were ok. Tetrazini could have had some more cheese in stead of white sauce. For the price they were decent. Will like to visit again to try some other preparations.

So this is our regular go-to takeaway place, what with its plethora of dishes and on-point delivery service. The food is super delish, never has it failed us on even a single occasion!!! Our special favourites are the Hong Kong Chicken Fried Rice, the Crispy Chilli Honey Chicken and the Chicken Lollipop. There isn't a hygiene issue, as we have known them take as much care while cooking as is rare in most of the other places. Again, you get such good food at so reasonable a price, no sky high taxes. Thus all in all, if you live anywhere around Dhakuria, and feel too lazy to actually go out to eat, give this place a try! Bet it'll have your taste buds all very pleased. Plus, it also helps that the man behind the business is very nice and amicable, and perks up every special (say, on your birthday!) with a free chinese salad or two! Thumbs up for that. More prosperity to you people!

Who knew this place will serve one of the best momos is town ? Well this was an unplanned evening as most of my food explorations are . A little eatery neat Jodhpur park . It has two tables and no AC . We had to wait for sometime as the place was full but it was indeed worth it .

Chicken steamed momo : the momos were juicy and oh so delicious ! They were quite big in size . One plate has 8 momos which costs 120 bucks . It's served with a spicy and tangy chutney. I'd want to suggest the management to start serving soup along with the momos. Without soup having momos is a incomplete for me .

Ham , bacon and chicken club sandwich with spicy mayo : This is perfection grilled between there slices of bread . Absolutely loved it !  A layer of fried egg enhances the taste over all . The spicy mayo stole the show . It was so yummy and filling. Highly recommended .

Spaghetti bolognese with chicken : perfect balance of tanginess and creaminess with minced chicken. Spaghetti is my favorite kind of pasta and there are hardly any joints which are affordable yet serve good quality spaghetti preps. Thumbs up to this prep !

Chicken in barbeque sauce with fries and boiled veg : yum yum and yum ! Chunks of soft chicken tossed in caramelized onion and barbecue sauce . The meat melted in my mouth . The fries and veg were good as well . 

Why 1 star less ? Because I think it's tad bit over priced since they don't even have proper seating space or AC. Other than that food was delicious .

Value for money 3/5 
Management and presentation : 4/5 
Food : 4/5 

Happy eating !!!

We had opted for their home delivery. The person taking the order was nice. Service was prompt. We had ordered for dry chilli chicken and dry chilli pork. The essence of both were same. The quantity was good and tasted perfect with just the right amount of spiciness.

Been here multiple times, have tried Kung Pao pork, ham sandwich, chicken noodles. The pork dish was one of the best I have ever had. Noodles was slightly oily for my liking, but good nonetheless. The sandwich was excellent as well... The place is good for takeaway, not sit and dine.

A small continental outlet that serves really good food. The staff are very hospitable too. It can unfortunately accommodate only 5-8 people at max and I really hope they expand real soon. 
:) 
I have tried almost everything here. Baked fish, ham and bacon club sandwich, risotto, chilli pork, fish and chips, my list of favorites goes on. 
Would definitely recommend it to first timers.

Excellent! Today was my first order to them through Zomato. We took 2 dishes of grilled fish with choice of sauce. Very reasonable price and very simple service. Simple packaging but very intelligently designed. Above all, the food was of excellent quality and very clearly it aas cooked and served with utmost care and dedication. In one word - a simple package of nice surprise! Definitely would like to explore more and would recommend to all foodies.

Just because of a small seating space and pretty uncomfortable during summers you guys missed the .5! 
Nevertheless, the best best club sandwiches and chinese available here. I have had limited Chinese dishes here but even then I am going gaga over it!! 

I ordered a ham bacon and chicken club sandwich with spicy mayo served with fries. Man, was it filling. I went without dinner that night. 
Crispy bacon. Perfect ham. Soft shredded chicken and an outstanding spiced mayonnaise. 
Amazing! 

Also, I have had their paella, and must say that it has an amazing mix of flavours not over powering any of the others. 

Please please open up a larger joint, with an air conditioner. Otherwise you guys have the heart of all foodies. 

You can always take away your orders (basically it is a take away joint) so please do that !! 
Otherwise you are missing on a lot lot of good food.
Cheers.

Just been there today evening. Me n my closest friend were hungry like hell and so we headed to hungry tide. 
We ordered ham, bacon and chicken club sandwich and spaghetti carbonara, milkshake(black current), hot coffee.......
1. The portion was sufficient enough for two of us.
2. The spaghetti tasted perfect with bacon n white sause.....real yum. Aunty suggested a pepper sauce with it which made it even better.
3. Sandwich was tasty and full of flavours.....the mayo in it was awesomely tasty....but it is toasted not grilled. May be it would have better if it was grilled.
3. Milkshake was quite tasty, smooth n perfectly sugared. Coffee, wellthe coffee was average. 
But most of everything it gave us a real homely feeling. Aunty asked us "khabar ta thik ache?"and "pet bhoreche?".......... Hope to be there soon again.

While this is a very small place but the food is surprisingly very good.  The green chilly pork is my favourite and other dishes are well prepared too.  If you are like me and like pork you should definitely visit this place and try it.

Tucked in a narrow lane in dhakuria ( located in the lane next to the lane beside tandoor park) , this outlet was in my bucket list for so many days and I finally succeeded visiting this place on saptami evening , and yes was very much surprised as well as glad to find this place almost empty . We ordered chicken hawaiian salad , shepherd ' s pie , and fresh lime soda . While the food they serve is no doubt great one thing they should introduce is a range of mocktails or soft drinks . The shepherds pie was nice and filling . I am looking forward to visit the place again to try other food items mentioned in their menu and also recommending everyone to give this place a try üòä

A pathetic joint with an over-the-top irritating server..
I went there with my friends during durga puja. They didnt have any proper seating arrangement. We had to adjust ourselves to a backyard where plastic chairs and tables were laid out a la pandal bhog eating style.
The menu surely looked interesting with a plethora of different cuisines. We ordered golden fried prawns, garlic cheese bread, parathas with malabari pork & chicken fried rice with sichuan fish
The food came after almost 30 mins considering there was nobody else in that place.
The prawns were more oil and less prawns and also the size of each prawn was smaller than expected
The bread was more a toast @60 bucks which is a instant mood-downer üëéüëé
The combo came with veg fried rice & sichuan fish. I got it replaced immediately
The parathas were soggy and the pork was undercooked...!! A big NO...!!! üëéüëé

Moreover, i would have considered it as the puja rush but the attitude of the main server was something which is intolerable in the hospitality field.. First of all he mocked us for using zomato, saying its one of the finest restaurants in kolkata..
Only a fool will call it a "restaurant" considering their unprofessionalism..!!!
Secondly, he started explaining the dishes to us in english as if we neither knew english nor we've ever eaten continental before..

I was waiting for my chance.. & as soon as i got it, i made him understand his actual worth albeit the mishaps he has done with the food quality and serving errors...
Well, considering the fact that it has average reviews of more than 4 and it has bases setup in 2 more locations, such behaviour is a strict NO...!!!

MANAGEMENT PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THIS THING IF YOU WANT SATISFYING AND LOYAL CUSTOMERS THE NEXT TIME AROUND

Note : I am NOT visiting this place again & will also recommend others to do the same

Ordered for Cantonese prawn noodles as take away. What I was served was really a great disappointment..! The gravy was just boiled starch water, there were hardly any prawns n the veggies were not sufficient in quantity! Taste was not at all good, gravy seemed like salty water! Not at all happy with my first experience.

When you're out with your friends on a Sunday evening and you decide to dine and you're near this location, this is the place to dine in. Or you can be crazy enough to walk a considerable distance to enjoy the food that's served here.  The 21st century's all about appearances and people judge a book by it's cover. But I'd suggest don't walk away after seeing this joint.  Do enter as it could be one of your best experiences. The food's awesome, so is the host. You will love everything on the menu and even it's pocket friendly. Vegans be aware as the options may be limited but you'll love it.  If you're near this place, do walk in. And I mean it. Do walk in and have a new experience as overrated places can be visited anytime....

This review is for the taratala outlet of hungry tide which is newly opened, located exactly at James long sarani. So, it is currently not available in zomato. I ordered chicken club sandwich. It was good and freshly made and different from authentic chicken sandwich. It was also cheap. Staffs were very polite.

I stay just out of your delivery zone and if I ever write a book like the 3 mistakes of my life ,this would be one.. amazing lip smacking taste with pocket friendly prices this restaurant should be on every persons wish list.  

P.S:  please expand your business to all parts of Kolkata guys... U would be millionaires and millions would be happy.

Comfort food means Ham Bacon and Chicken Club  Sandwich with Spicy Mayo @ Hungry Tide Dhakuria. This small joint located in the lane opposite Selimpur Arambags... Never fails to surprise me.. I have many favourites... The club sandwich being my SOULMATE . üíñ

Priced at Rs 150, this sandwich served with potato chips has generous amount of mayonnaise.. chicken.. soft yummily cooked bacon and fried egg. It's enough to serve as dinner for one adult.

Team it up with Cheese Ham Square [ Only if you like an overdose of cheese ]

Don't let the small size of the eatery fool you, it cooks up a mean green chilli pork and an all mix fried rice which will appeal to your taste buds for sure. Have tried the the continental courses as well from its vide array, all being extremely delicious. The prices are quite affordable and quite a value for money.

This small place is located in one of the many alleys that branch out from the Gariahat Road. A little difficult to spot,as it is not standing tall on the main road,it might as well go unnoticed. The best landmark would be the Domino's Pizza of Jodhpur Park. The road exactly opposite to this pizza store leads you to Hungry Tide. The place is mainly aimed at catering to the takeaway orders. There are only 2 tables with 1 table having 4 chairs and the other having 3 chairs. Though the location or the ambience might give you many things to complain about,but when the food arrives it will definitely compel you to think otherwise. The food here is that good. We had ordered Drums of Heaven and Chicken Club Sandwich. The Drums of Heaven were the best drumsticks I have ever had. They are even better than what Hatari serves. 8 pieces were beautifully complemented on a plate with impressive decorations with vegetables. The drumsticks had a spicy and smokey taste which was very appreciable. The Sandwich was a double-decker sandwich. This was suggested to us by the waiter and our listening to him paid off. There is a choice for the mayo which you will be asked for when you place your order. We tried the plain mayo and it blended absolutely with the sandwich. The sandwich was heavy too with roasted egg,vegetables and chicken pieces making up for its heaviness. The prices might seem a bit on the higher side but the food served here is worth it. They have a variety of items and it might seem to be a paradise for continental lovers. I strongly recommend everyone to visit this place. I would surely go to this place again.

Wonderful! Yes that's how my review would start! The non ac clumsy atmosphere(It is mainly meant for take aways) may disappoint but once the food ordered arrives all that disappointment just disappears!
One of the best garnishing is done here in the entire city! One just loves the look of the platter, let alone tasting it! Coming to food- we ordered
1. drums of heaven (INR 200)-Comprises of 8 chicken leg pieces.Hands down the best I have ever tried!Superb garnishing and the taste was just to die for.Crispy outer covering and juicy chicken inside...I am falling short of words to describe the taste in words!
2.chicken club sandwich (INR 110)- We took this at the staff's recommendation and weren't disappointed at all.It's a double decker sandwich which is a 3 bread sandwich that is served as a meal,that is ,with potato chips. The upper layer consists of fried egg,onion and tomato while the lower layer has a concoction of chicken and mayo.There are choices of mayo-spicy chicken and the plain mayo.We opted for the plain mayo.The sandwich tasted great and was heavy! Definitely served as a meal!
I am surely going to frequent this place and would strongly recommend it to everyone!

Hungry Tide is one restaurant I can never say no to whenever asked.
Situated in the lane opposite Bata- Selimpur, this place is a students delight. The place is quite small with 2 tables and no AC but don't get put away by its appearance.
They have an elaborate menu and you'll be spoilt for choices. Quantity served is more than enough.

We ordered the below items and the observations follow:

Prawn Cocktail-It seems to be extremely less in quantity when home delivered and is best to have in the outlet because of the nature of the dish.However,even in the outlet,I will personally avoid it as it's not worth.

Fish and Chips-The best of the lot as the dish was marinated with some green elements(not sure what) but tasted pretty good.The fish fillet was soft and the dip was decent.

Drums of Heaven-Decent in taste but could have been better in terms of the softness and marination.

Tucked away in a little alley in Dhakuria this little eatery has surprised me a lot with its extensive menu and such good food! I had tried the chicken wrapped in bacon, 2 lamb dishes and mixed fried rice. The flavour that each dish had was mind-blowing! The owner too is very sweet and accomodating. I will visit it again soon!

So one fine day we ordered Bacon wrapped chicken with cheesy dip, sweet chilly pork served along with Thai rice and the Shepherd's pie. The staff were very polite and courteous and we received our order within ten minutes. 
So coming to the food the bacon wrapped chicken with cheesy dip was soo delectable and yummy. The Thai rice had a wonderful combination of sweet and sour. The sweet chilly pork was equally tasty. However I personally did not enjoy the shepherd's pie with mashed potatoes and minced lamb pieces. 
Overall it was good and the prices are also affordable.

Heard a lot bout this place n finally me n a friend of mine decided to go there for lunch. The place is very easy to locate. Its more like a tiny eatery than a proper restaurant with around 3tables max. But don't let the appearance fool you! The food is amazingly delicious n the quantity will surely challenge your appetite for sure.. we specifically went there to try pork for the first time n ordered teriyaki pork with a rice dish.. it was heavenly! The place is quite hygienic n pocket friendly.. if ur super hungry n seriously craving some good food.. this is d place u should visit!

Hungry Tide is one such restaurant you would love to visit each and every time you are asked for. You would go to this place only and only because of its food.The place gives you some great variety of food in a very reasonable price.
Location:
This outlet is located in the UBI Building in Dhakuria or just in the opposite lane to Domino's. There are sign boards which will help you to reach the place.

Ambience:
Nothing as such. The place is garage where 3 tables and few chairs are placed. The place doesn't have an AC which is very important in this summer.

Service:
Its fine. The owner was friendly and a decent person to chat with The food we ordered was on the table within few minutes and we didnt had to wait much.

Food:
Food is what makes you forget everything else about this place. Its the taste which will really make you happy and neglect the other things. So these were the things we ordered for the day:

#Pork and Bacon DiffFried Rice : This is the preparation we didn't like. As they tried to make it different, they flopped with it. The rice was not fried well and it didn't taste well too. The bacon and pork chunks could have been lil more.

#Pork Sichuan : Well, this turned out to be excellent. Lil sweet as honey is used in this preparation lil tangy with cashews all over. The pork and bacons were soft and it tasted really good.

#Chicken Steak With Mushroom Sauce: The steak had won my heart for the evening. The preparation was "wow". Bread, veggies, French fries and Chicken Steak was all they gave. The chicken chunk was quite big and the flavour was coming really well. Wanna go for this again.

#Chicken Sriracha : Another dish with sweet and sour taste. The preparation is done with tamarind sauce, tomato sauce and brown sugar. The chicken pieces tasted good and was not dry from inside, which I liked.

Last Words:
So, this place is a very good option to try out some thai and continental dishes in a very reasonable price.The quality of food is excellent and it wont disappoint you for sure. Always a go to option.

4/5 for its food (excluding the ambience)

We ordered risotto with bacon and ham...well cooked rice with cheese and butter and capsicum tasted a bit bland for a spicy tongue of mine..but to pamper my taste buds Malbari pork was ready...awesome gravy with juicy pork fibres served with parathas..fresh lime soda was majestic as well..and hawaiian chicken salad..with pineapples...worth a try..

I have not been to their Gariahat outlet but have been to this Dhakuria outlet and it has been a sheer disappointment both times..Their food is overpriced and not at all up to the mark. Their pastas are simple homemade pastas.. nothing exceptional about it. Their Garlic bread is simple bread toasted with amul garlic butter with so much Garlic that you would need mouthwash after that.. Their stir fries' quantity is too less which they serve with a big amount of rice. Their fried rice is also not good.. I am sure that I am never going back here again!!!

The jumbo chicken ham bacon club sandwitch was what i ordered. Trust me it cant be eaten all at once. Its so heavy and huge. The chicken, the bacon ,everything was well cooked and the spicy mayo was just as much required. The sandwitch is so filling and yummy. Apart from this there was a chicken pasta in white sauce i forgot the name of the sauce though. The pasta i had to share with my sister. Quantity is very good here and price is worthful.. i loved this place and would visit again surely.

While walking from Jadavpur P.S to golpark, I found this place just opposite to Dominos dhakuria. Its a small eatery with just 2 tables and its Non-AC. Being hungry, I went in and ordered a chicken club sandwich with spicy mayo. It took 10mins for my club sandwich to reach me but it was good in quantity & contained eggs, tomato, onion, mayo & minced chicken mixed together. It was served along with the usual chips. Overall I liked the sandwich & will try some bigger stuff like pastas & baked items.

I had first been to the counter of Hungry Tide at hindusthan park. Lately, I revisited the outlet near Dhakuria. Its in a lane opposite to the Selimpur Bata. Located in a tiny garage, decked white and yellow , two tables of four.
I love their club sandwiches. Specially the ham bacon chicken egg jumbo sandwich filled with cheese and mayo. Its huge and very tasty. I also love their gravy chowneins. Sp. Pork ones. They also serve continental dishes , the owner herself cooks and serves these. Great taste at very reasonable price.

Hungry tide is one among those places which attracts a huge portion of the student crowd because of the cheap pricing of the dishes. It was long in my wishlist but due to lack of seating space, I didn't want to visit the outlet near Hindustan park. But when my fellow foodie suggested me the Dhakuria outlet, which has seating, I instantly made up my mind to visit this place.

This outlet is also a takeaway like the other one. But fortunately there is a seating for four people. We were there on a Sunday evening and luckily it was empty. The menu is very diverse. Since we were into the mains, we ordered paella with bacon, sausage and roast pork and baked fish with prawns, with a fresh lime soda.

First came the paella. This is the national dish of Spain. The quantity was enormous and is enough for two. The rice had a tangy yet spicy flavour. It was loaded with huge portions of roast pork, sausage, bacon, tomatoes, capsicum, onions, etc. The ingredients were very fresh and juicy. A side dip was provided, with a coconut base, which complemented the rice well. I was very impressed with this dish.

Baked fish with prawns was also a good dish. The fish was well cooked. Even the prawns were succulent and juicy. The white sauce was rich in cheese!

The fresh lime soda was too sweet for my liking.

Our bill was just 700 bucks which was worth the food which we had. This place serves some great sandwiches too! Will be having them in my next visit!

Well, what do I say? I happened to visit this really pocket-size eatery today evening and I were frankly shaken up with this particular branch! The food was okay! We had ordered bacon wrapped prawns in cheese dip, baked fish with prawns and chicken parmigiana (basically grilled chicken served with mashed potato), out of which only the baked fish with prawn was genuinely outstanding! The rest were just edible. Honestly, the bacon was too salty to be ignored. Also it was slightly overcooked. Service was more or less good. I hope the signature dishes are at least good enough. And I personally felt that the bacon wrapped prawn would have synced better with mayonnaise or a rich orange tartar dip instead of the cheese dip! And it is ideal for take away! You could go and pay a visit though, provided it's winter!

Ordered Thai green prawn curry, chicken steak with mushroom sauce, baked fish with lemon butter sauce, chicken lemon coriander soup during the last month. I have to say that they have improved a lot since the last time we ordered from them, back when that review below was written. Thai prawn curry came with rice. There was six pieces of jumbo prawns and vegetables in hot green curry. It was hot, it was tasty, it was a perfect pick me up during fever. Chicken steak came with garlic bread, French fries and boiled vegetables. Quantity was good; good enough to feed me for two meals. Baked fish also came with fries and boiled vegetables, with the sauce in a separate container. Lemon coriander soup was awfully tasty and they give a big container full of it. This place has now become one of our preferred ones. From 2.5 to 4.0. Hat's off to them!

Ordered Shepherd's pie, and pork and egg rice noodles. Shepherd's pie was, to be frank, nothing like a good old fashioned Shepherd's pie. It was a disaster! Do not go for it, ever, unless they learns to improve it. And you need a magnifying glass to find the eggs and pork in the extremely dry rice noodles.

There is a wide range of items to choose from and most of them are pretty different from what we regularly get in restaurants. The Baked Fish/Chicken is especially delicious. It's a privilege to have such a reasonably priced and quality restaurant in our vicinity..

Not very difficult to spot, they have got a hoarding leading to the lane just behind ubi. It's a small place with just two tables but don't judge a book by its cover. Trust me it was an absolute delight to dine there. 
Don't expect posh interiors or anything out of the box but they do best what they are supposed to do. Yes the food. Its OUTSTANDING. For starters we chose the bacon wrapped chicken with cheese dip. It was a treat for the eyes and definitely for the palate. Succulent pieces of chicken wrapped in bacon, cooked to perfection. It took some time for the delicacies to arrive but we didn't mind waiting a bit. And now the main course. Shepherd's pie and mixed grill it was. Really good quantity wise and delectable as well. Mixed grill was a plethora of items and we loved it. To wash it all down we ordered a fresh lime soda to go along with this meaty affair. Yes I am definitely coming back to try their other items.

Food is what matters not decor or interior. Hungry Tide proves that again. The outlet is very well located at Dhakuria. From look, its not much. Just 2 tables and a counter at the bottom of an apartment. But the food speaks for them. And so does the warm welcome.

We picked up Veg Paella, Chicken Tetrazzini, Sheppard's pie and Chicken Parmigiana. Every dish was fabulous. Well cooked or baked. The price is perfect and the amount is gracious. 

I am looking forward to the next visit. Might even plan to sit down and try oven fresh at their outlet. They are famous for Continental dishes but from their menu they seem to have some interesting chinese too.

Overall they are worth a 4 for their food.

Hungry tide was on my wish list for quite sometime. Finally yesterday I managed to drop in there dhakuria outlet to satiate my after shopping hunger pangs.

Location: Pretty close to main road the outlet is located on the ground floor of a building
Only two sets of table laid out, and we managed to get one.
Food: The sandwiches are good stuffing and seasonings just right...
I had a bit of high expectation for chicken steak that was a disappointment. The piece of steak was hard and chewy,not very enjoyable.
The texture was strange. Though the saut√©ed veggies,fries,bread rolls and mushroom sauce were good, the chicken could have been a lot better.
What I liked is the feedback was taken positively by the person at the counter.
Price: Ok, not very cheap though.

Overall: Shall be back for more.

Hingry Tide is a small and unassuming restaurant that surprises with its food. Their choice of various oriental and continental cuisines, treatment of food and respect for ingredients brings out great food. They offer various proteins including chicken, fish, pork and lamb and they do not disappoint. It would be better if they can introduce duck since oriental cuisine is incomplete without duck. Obviously, being light on pocket also doesnt hurt. Only criticism or rather advise would be if they had a proper dining area.

"Drums of Heaven" stands out to be the perfect dish in Starters. The mixed noodles without pork was quite a good one along with delicious green chilli chicken. Overall the quantity and quality of food was really commendable. I am not going to mark anything with ambience since it's a small food joint as you can't expect anything special  with seating capacity and all.
Price wise it's really pocket friendly. I would go with 4/5 stars.

I had heard about this small food joint which primarily functioned on a delivery model as they didn't have a proper dine-in arrangement. However later we realised that this place does not deliver to New alipore. We decided to pick up the food directly from their outlet to give it a shot as we heard really good reviews about this place. They have 2 outlets in total. One is in gariahat and this was the other one in Dhakuria which is very close to Jodhpur Park. We ordered a chicken tetrazzini and Pepper Pork with Thai Fried Rice. Both the dishes were nice. I wouldn't say they were the best but they were good. Their quantity is good too. Also this place is quite pocket friendly comparatively. All in all a good place to order from if it delivers to your neighbourhood.

The rating is for the food only. This is undoubtedly one joint of south kolkata that is going to make you go back to them, just for the only one reason and that is food. The quality and taste of all the items in the menu is mind blowing. I dont think fine dine  restaurants have such an elaborate menu or not. Parking is a problem. So home delivery seems to be a better option. But overall food rocks.

My personal favourite is the sandwich with bacon mayo chicken. The sandwiches are filling and not that expensive.

Hungry Tide has a really ambitious menu. But I'd say that's all that there is. I like how they use good produce and meat and the cooking style is nice too but somehow it doesn't cut it for me. The food is very ordinary compared to the fancy names on the menu.
Recommended: chicken bacon wrap and the cheese sauce is pretty tasteful or the baked fish.
Thumbs up : Hospitable atmosphere .

Again without Zomato, I would never know they existed but boy o boy the deliver some awesome food. My personal favourite is the green chilly chicken; which also is their signature dish. Its a bit hot so people who have issue with spicy food you are missing out on something special. Also they have some cool pork dishes which I have ordered and loved. My personal favourite is the chilly pork. They are by far the best and cheapest pork who deliver at your doorstep in the area.
Their delivery is really good and they don't charge anything extra for packaging and delivery.

I have also heard about the continental dishes here which I am waiting to try and will update this review after that. Also I plan to go and dine there once to get the feel of the place. Until then , for the amazing food and great delivery experience I give it 4/5.

Had heard so much about this place that a friend and I thanked our stars as we found a table for ourselves immediately, with no hustle-bustle queue behind us. It would have been easy to have missed it had we not been looking for it! 

We ordered a Potato and Pineapple salad, and a chicken steak with mushroom sauce to go with two fruit coolers. Needless to say, they tasted like comfort. While the overly health conscious might want to take another pick for their daily fill of salad, anybody else will love the sweetness of potato and how the acidity of the pineapple so wonderfully complements it. The steak was done right and the sauce was scrumptious. The coolers weren't extraordinary - could have made do without them.

Considering the quantity and quality of the food we treated ourselves to, the bill wasn't all too hefty on our pockets. A must-visit for those who keep hearing about it but just can't get themselves to do it. üòÑ

Located in one of the by-lanes of Dhakuria, Hungry Tide is a teeny weeny restaurant that can accommodate barely 8 people. It's tiny and it's not airconditioned. But don't let that stop you from giving this food joint a shot.
They have an elaborate menu. You'll literally be spoilt for choices.
We had Drums of heaven, Bacon paella, Shepherd's pie, Chinese combo with garlicky pork and fresh lime soda.  Every item tasted extremely good. Considering the price of each item the quantity is humongous. A single portion of the paella can literally serve two.
I'd strongly recommend this place to anyone who's willing to try out good food at low prices. Hungry Tide is by far the best restaurant in Dhakuria. Looking forward to be here again!

The steak was sadly a cutlet. This was after an hour of agonising wait as to whether they deliver to Santoshpur. Everything else was satisfactory.

Come here if you want food that is delicious, smells great, looks appetizing and served with a smile.¬† 
Presentation :- The bright yellow colour interior is really eye catching and makes you happy.. like those small Italian joints of Sanorita's in Rome! 
Food:- The continental is really good and quite beutyfully done.. and they don't comprise on quality nor quantity..The best in South Kolkata! People and Service:- Mr.Sunil the Owner is a great personality and really friendly and helpful... He can really tell you what exactly you would like to eat if you are confused.. and it is also a place for bikers to be coz Sunil being a rider and his KTM bikes are quite a talk among his valued customers.. 
Over all I would say a perfect place for youngsters to hang around and there is always home delivery for Uncle and aunties..
Loved the over all experience...... olla!

One of my favorite pork serving joints in the city. The ham and cheese squares, bacon wrapped chicken, baked ham and chicken, risotto, paella, ¬†the pork preparations and the diffried rice have always satisfy me to the fullest every time I visit this place.
The friendly service and pocket friendly menu draws me in, in the hungry afternoons. I wish they start up again with the baked pork with vegetables which was ¬†all cheesy and sumptuous.

Been here several times. A delight for pork lovers. Never had any veg or chicken dish here but trued out a diverse range of pork delicacies. A friendly and homely joint with very small sitting arrangement.¬†The only dish in their menu which i personally disliked is the sweet & sour pork.And yes,don't go for the combos.The price may be very alluring but the dishes are worth every extra penny spent.

Try their delicious bacon wrapped chicken, ham and cheese squares, risotto and chilly pork. 
Cheers!!

A small joint mainly targeting take aways and home delivery orders....they have just two tables for those who want an eat out.
None the less the food is very very good....and you get a homely atmosphere with friendly laid back people in charge of the place. No hurries..no worries. The cost is very reasonable considering the quality of food they serve. Good experience. A word for all the review writers and foodies on Zomato....what you can expect, the price and the delicacies to order have been spot on...So thank you.
We ordered Mushroom Risotto, Chicken 65, crispy chilly babycorn and Mixed Grill...all the dishes were very good to taste. I am certainly going back there for a casual dining...another positive for me at least is that it is a five minute walk from my place....üòú.

This restaurant (the second of the two outlets) is a classic david vs. goliath in today's booming restaurant business. Having established themselves out of a converted garage they have quickly built up a following with their outstanding food.
What I love about the menu is it's sensibility. It's got a great variety, whether it be continental, oriental, even Indian and also suits almost every kind of eater. Whether a quick bite, an appetizer, a value-for-money combo or an all out meal, the options are all delicious.
You can rely on the friendly advice of the proprietor if you want to or go with your gut :-) because its hard to go wrong.
Although they have limited seating in the premises, it would be recommended more as a take-away or a home-delivery joint.

I didn't actually visit the place but I had ordered food a few times from here, and suffice to say, it is excellent. From the bacon wrapped prawns to the chilli mushrooms to their assortment of chowmein, this restaurant satiates our impromptu plans like no other. And did I mention that it is pocket friendly as well?

This place is a blessing to all food lovers. I've visited a variety of restaurants around the city but none I feel is as brilliant compared to Hungry Tide. It's a small joint near Selimpur which is quite easy to miss actually. It's basically a takeaway as it has only two tables and not much space to dine. Now let that not get you down. I can honestly state without exaggeration that this place serves the best Chinese food in the city. Each and every dish they make is cooked finely and with perfection. The proportions are quite large and so is their presentation. They have the yummiest pork in town. The Mongolian Crunchy Pork is as amazing as it gets. Their meifoon is another marvel. And the place is quite reasonable when it comes to price. I'm not gonna name dishes coz all the Chinese dishes that I've tasted here were just perfect and I've tasted almost all of them. They make a killer Spaghetti Carbonara and Spaghetti Bolognese. But the other continental dishes aren't as brilliant as they rest of the food here. I'll be frank about this. You won't know how good this place is until you eat here.

I think given the price,the quantity,the range of items and the fact that the taste is moderately good,this place is pretty good for college-goers like us. Also for munching something at home while binge-watching since they have the home-delivery facility too.

The only time I've been there I've found the food to be quite moderate. Not as great as I've heard. I would like to try the bacon wrapped chicken and the pork,soon.
Last time we had chicken appasionata. Taste was quite good but nothing as exotic as I had expected it to be.
The baked fish was good,but not the best I've had.
Quantity is very good and more than justifies the price.
Not really a fancy place to sit,chat and eat. Take-aways and home-deliveries are preferable.

The first thing comes to your mind when u enter this place is "Small" . It ends as soon as u enter it with barely having seats fr 8 ppl in total in that. They serve more or less good food but very pricy in comparison to its space, decor and for all the other features of it (didnt notice any though).

Located opposite to Jodhpur Park Domino's, it's a small place that serves amazing Club Sandwiches.. Bacon, Ham and Mayo.. At the right levels.
The place is too small for dine-in. But if one's craving for bacon and Ham.. This should be his affordable and delighting destination.

The other items in the menu aren't bad, but I wouldn't choose the place for them.

One of the finest food joint for Continental Foods in South Kolkata, this outlet of Hungry Tide deserves a 4.5 star for its food quality. Though it can arrange 10 persons at a time since it's a speciality take away restaurant, the option of home delivery is a good addition. Some of the worth mentioning dishes are Ham Sandwich, Chicken Mixed Grill, Chicken Stroganoff! The list could be long and ‚Çπ500 is enough to fill the stomach of U and ur friend. 
P.S. No taxation but No Air Conditioners also.

Ordered twice in a week...tht says a lot. I'm pretty impressed wid d online ordering n delivery service. D most important thing...dey don't charge for delivery nor packing. (I stay in lake gardens)also no xtra taxes.I tried d Spicy mayo chicken sandwich,made perfect wid a fried egg...my fav. Also d Chicken n mushroom diffried rice was really good. Chicken momo was quite filling,bt i missed d soup as dey don't serve any soup.d momo chutney is nt a chutney...bt a plain chilli n tomato sauce(nt a fan of it). The misses....teriyaki chicken (8pieces for 160)...d sauce was too sweet nd d coating was too thick. Nxt...Fish n chips...2 good quality fish fillet...only it tasted like bengali fish fry wid mustard nd all....nt at all like Fish n chips should be.better change d nme 2 fish fry thn. Didn't enjoy d taste.
Anyways....will keep trying other dishes...more bcoz delivery is free nd min order Rs350 is nt much.
A suggestion....spicy chicken mayo sandwich comes wid a fried egg at 110. Bt d Egg sandwich at 100 also comes wid only 1 egg....why will any1 pay d same for it.please provide 2 eggs.please...
20.11.15
I'm editing my review to 4.5 bcoz it has d best home delivery service until now. No extra cost for packaging or delivery...which is gr8. Min. Order Rs.300 nd delivers within 30mins.....nd to top it all....both quantity nd taste aren't compromised. This is my go2 place for home delivery. Please try dis place atleast once. 
25.11.15
Ordered chicken carbonara...Chicken in Barbeque sauce nd Chicken in black bean sauce. I'm sorry but I didn't like a single dish. Chicken in barbeque sauce....really??? It was boneless chicken in burnt onion gravy..in a pool of oil...no hint of barbeque sauce...why name it then?
Nxt up....Chicken Carbonara....too much of white sauce...lacked seasoning....no one cooks good pasta here.
Lastly, chicken in black bean sauce....recommended by many on zomato....tried for the 1st tym. But guess wht? Its chicken coated in cornflour nd tossed with onion,capsicum nd soya sauce....thts it....Black bean sauce...wht the hell is that thn??? I'm wondering....took my rating to 3.5 frm 4.5 today.

I absolutely love Hungry Tide. They are my go-to place for quick deliveries and they do not believe in small portions which is always a plus. A no-fuss food joint that focuses on delivering consistently superior, good quality food, Hungry Tide is the underdog restaurant of South Kolkata.¬†

I recommend the Thai Basil Fried Rice with Hot Garlic Pork. Although pretty much anything on their menu is good to go.

When they came they were a relief for the foodies taste bud... But 2day when i went back aftr a few months... I find drastic change... I ordered for a bacon risotto and spaghetti  carbonara.. The carbonara dint hv salt... And was missing proper quantity of bacon.... Risotto was nuthn bt frired rice in form of lumps with bits of pieces of cheese here n there.. And the worst part is... After calling the restaurant  they sed they cudn do nethn untill 2morrow.... I mean they expect me to keep the food till the next day for a replacement...or for a matter of fact a plain n simple complaint...obnoxious owner..!!
Tooo unhappy with food n the lack of courtesy... Completely disheartened.

This is a little bigger version of the Hungry Tide at Gariahat. They have proper sitting arrangements, but for around eight people. Their food is really good. It's the same, but they have a broader variety in the menu. I like the same dishes as that of Gariahat. And also, the chicken chettinad, hoisin lamb and green chilli chicken. This too is highly recommended. A very nice place. Happy Dining! :)

Hungry Tide is a quaint little place located close to dakshinapan market,and has earned a name for itself for the superior and tasty foods they are serving..though this place is mainly known for their european and american cuisines they also serve some preety tasty chinese and indian cuisines..what I liked about this place is that coming out of the conventional spreads you will find in most of the restaurants they actually prepare some not so famous and mainstream dishes..SInce this place is quite small..it is preferred for a take-away and they provide free home-delivery service as well..
We decided to try a few of their signature dishes:
Bacon wrapped Prawns: A light brownish texture..charred on the outside..loved the smoky flavour..though the cheese dip served was a bit too heavy on our palate..
Shepherd's Pie: Loved the upper crust,it was crisp,brown,light,the flavour of the egg was distinct..the mutton was minced and cooked nicely..
Green Chilli Chicken: Actually it tasted better than expected..loved the pungent flavour of chillies..also the smell of coriander paste highlighted the dish..
Malbari Mutton: Small boneless chunks of mutton..flavours of coconut and curry leaves and a bit of sourness made the dish a tasty affair..served with complementary parathas was well..
Butter Garlic Fish: This lacks the flavours..way too bland..lacks the seasoning..
Other recommended dishes are Pasta,Paella and their grilled items..
Overall our total cheque comes to just 1500/-for six of us..Highly Recommended..

I went to this place with my friends..
7 of us went to the dhakuria branch.. Sitting is an issue.. But the food was just mind blowing!!!

I had the best Hawaiian chicken salad there.. Which made me order twice more after my first visit.. The mayo they used was homemade and was heaven to the taste bud
The chicken lollipop was also amazing...should try both the dishes 
All other dishes ordered were also great just that the Chinese combo that we ordered was very average .. 

I will suggest to go and have some awesome continental!! 
Just a suggestion to the management: 
Please expand the restaurant coz it's quite difficult since small to accomodate a big group which make us rethink to visit the place when we r in a big group!! Although love the food there...

If you are here for a quick lunch , do try their combos , they are awesome to taste just like the other foods and serve a sumptuous portion that come at a fairly less than reasonable price..do enjoy eating..

It's a pretty decent place and I've ordered before but today they decided to charge on delivery despite agreeing that it's free within a two km radius - the establishment being at Dhakuria and my home being in Lake Gardens, which is barely a km. If I can spend a few hundred rupees, I can surely afford the extra fifty but the fact that they wanted to con me out of that meagre an amount is very disappointing. They lost a customer us all I can say.

Hungry Tide is a very good place and quite affordable, especially for college goers like us who find it really easy to drop in and have a really good meal. The place is small and cozy and does not have a huge fancy decor but makes up for it with their menu. I love their Tetrazinni and other baked items. The service is very homely and if you are hungry it will more than make up for your empty stomach. :)

Have been a regular since this outlet opened - we order food at least once in a week if not more. So by now I've tasted quite a few dishes, such as Hunan Chicken, Chilli Pork, Spaghetti Bolognese, Sticky Pork (with cashew and broccoli), various kinds of noodles, rice and club-sandwiches, Hot & Sweet Pork, Pepper Pork, Chilli Chicken, Green Chilli Chicken, Chicken Parmigiana, Sweet & Sour Fish, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Tetrazzini, Baked Fish (with prawn), Crevettes a la Creme, Mongolian Lamb and many more. 

Out of the plethora of dishes, Chilli Pork and Spaghetti Bolognese are my all-time favourite which I'd certainly recommend to all pork and mutton eaters. Sticky Pork and Hunan fish also I'd recommend. Their gravy chow is something that one should try out. The various combos available are pretty economical as well.

The best thing about this place is that it suits a student‚Äôs pocket very well. Good food which is out of the ordinary, at a reasonable price and good quantity. Lastly, it would be nice to see an increase in the size of the seating capacity of the restaurant. The ambiance is very warm and welcoming; the people behind the counter also help us choose what to order with what at times. Service is quite speedy. 

Do visit if you haven‚Äôt already, I can assure you that there will be something or the other that‚Äôll get you addicted!!

I happened to have lunch over here in one of my friends birthday.
The place is worth trying.
We ordered chilli pork , Garlic Chicken, Honey chicken and gravy noodles.
Service was quite good.
Food was awesome!
The chilli pork and the honey chicken were my favourite! The food was served within no time.
The best thing about this place is its quite within the budget for all foodies out there.
Highly recommended for students too!
Cheers!

Otherwise a good joint, Hungry Tide is now showing signs of deterioration. They are messing up orders as I have received Hunan chicken instead of honey chicken and so on. The quality of the prawn they serve is not good at all. It's chewy and tastes bad. They also fail to understand what the customer exactly wants. We ordered for a prawn dish WITHOUT chili and they gave us a preparation with chili. When we called them to replace the dish they said they'd call back with confirmation but did nothing about it. Very disappointed with them of late.

Hungry Tide, one of the newer restaurants to join the continental bandwagon in Kolkata certainly made me quite content with the quality and quantity of the foods and service they provided. Kind of an impulsive visit it was, we sure dint had much of high hopes from the tiny outlet that was kinda a garage space modified into a restaurant but they sure made change my opinions the time I was leaving the place.

Ambiance - As mentioned earlier also, not a lavish , sprawling space for fine dining, very much casual dining type with spunky colours like yellow, orange dominating the walls with light plastic furnishings.

Food - We ordered
1. Mixed Rice - Elaborate. in one word. Huge quantity with generous portions of egg,chicken,prawn and pork. Try sharing a plate if you really dont have a shark's appetite. Quite tasty and cooked in a bit different style from the traditional fried rices we get in Kolkata.
2. Mixed Chow - The noodly counterpart of the rice.. I somehow liked the noodles more than the rice.
3. Pork Vindaloo - It was the dish of the day and we ordered though it was a bit odd combination alright :P anyways, it had almost 8-10 pieces of pork, well cooked, soft but the gravy wasnt quite upto the mark. I had better pork Vindaloos.

Service - quite freindly and polite, waiting time wasnt much long, approx 15 mins.¬†

I was just chatting with them earlier and they told that they just completed 1 year and honestly i kinda forgot that t the end of the meal, but they gave us a bowl of gulabjamuns as a gesture for their return gift for their birthday, which was really good and appreciable.¬†

They have a very varied menu and we were just too full after what we had so wasnt able to try anything else but I am surely looking forward to visit this place again to try some other of their foods. Overall a nice experience. Cheers!!

I never went to hungry tide but heard about it a lot. Yesterday i thought of giving it a try. The dhakuria outlet is very near to my place, and i ordered some of their items for home delivery. Bacon and ham rice, mixed rice and chicken chettinad. The quality of rice and pork was really good. Bacon and ham rice was way too tasty. Chicken chettinad was a good try even. Home delivery was pretty fast,hardly 30 mins. Hence i can suggest this place, for some really nice food, and it's cheap too.

a few months back i had my first tryst with hungry tide when i opted for home delivery! we had a hot and sour soup which was exttremely tangy and well flavored along with a combo of hakka noodles and chilli chicken. the person who took our order over the phone was horrible and ill-informed but the food was quite yum, the quantity was great, the price was easy on the pocket.

tryst no.2- as its located very near my place i went on xmas day to pick some dinner up. the tiny garage was not very appealing but the gentleman and lady there were brisk, nice and professional! i took home chicken with broccoli and a rice which my parents loved!

tryst no. 3- today i called them up once more for home delivery *i cannot lug myself out on a lazy free sunday to chomp on spicy food in a garage however good it might be :P* and my order was taken smoothly, edited nicely when i called back a couple of minutes later to redeem my mistake and the food is here :D i am writing this review as i much on my citrus chilli pork with rice which is scrumptious and sip my hot and flavorful lemon coriander chicken soup <3 at just 380 bucks getting this deal is beyond imagination..and ohh the food is packed so very well <3 loving it!

It's new year's eve and any place around is either booked or has a line. 
I had heard about Hungry Tide and surfed through their impressive menu on  Zomato and I thought I would give it a try.  It was a treat to my parents so it had to be better than good.
And that it was.
We ordered a chicken and ham appasionata which was delectable and perfect.
And a chicken and pepper stir fry which balanced the flavours really well.
And a hot garlic baby corn and mushroom. Which had the right amount of heat and was delicious.
When even big restaurants fail on such hectic days, Hungry Tide delivered and well. Both quality and quantity was brilliant. 
And the food- sumptuous.

Not exactly a car park friendly location..but not too much trouble either. Ordered a chicken risotto and a mongolian crunchy chili pork. The risotto was very nice and sufficient for a single person. I have never had an authentic risotto so I wouldn't be the one vouching for the continentality of the preparation, but I liked it. It had cheese without being cheesy (now THIS is cheesy). A smart sprinkling of black pepper and a nice amount of good chicken. This isn't the chicken one finds in the sub 80 rupee chicken chowmeins. These actually were good moist chicken chunks.¬†

The chili pork was very nice too, although it was a bit too sweet for my taste. The sweet bell peppers used actually were fresh. The pork was very nicely cooked and wasn't hard even though it had a little less fat than what I usually like.¬†

The ambience is kindof cosy although I am not really sure if it is to everyone's liking.

I liked the place and would definitely be going back

This review is for the Selimpur branch of Hungry Tide , the front office of which operates out of a garage (?). Just beside the alley for "Nan Ping" on Gariahat Road (South). It specializes on take away food (continental + Chinese).
But , without any qualms , they serve out very very tasty continental and chinese dishes.

Chicken and Spicy Mayo Club Sandwich , Chicken Carbonara Pasta , Minced Mutton Shepherd Pie and Specially Chicken Tetrazzini remains my favs from the Continental menu. The white cream , the quality 
of meat , the baking are of very high quality.
You can order the Tetrazzini in two different sizes and price as well ! !

Interestingly they serve good quality chinese food as well. Sweet n Sour Chicken , Kung Pao Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice are my favorites.
For such quality food at such a reasonable price , it is a definite 4 from me.

Made a visit to this small eatery on the occasion of my friend's birthday today. The place is really very small, only 2 table to sit 8 people. Best as a takeaway if its the rush hours or you are a large group. We were just two people and were able to get a seat as it was empty at around 9 pm.¬†

Our order: bacon wrapped chicken, spaghetti bolognese, prawn mixed gravy chowmein and two green apple coolers. The order took around 15 minutes too come and I must say, the portions are real good.¬†

The quality of the food is good too and the staff( actually two people) are nice and did suggest us with the coolers. The bacon was finely made and tasted good with the chicken. The bolognese was good but not a 100% Italian; tastes good though. The chowmein was of equal standards as found in other Chinese eateries. ¬†

Loved the coolers. The taste was perfect and a soothing drink.¬†

Will surely try out other items here soon.

So I had heard about this place from my friends a week ago and decided to drop by when I was in the neighbourhood with a friend. We were scared we would miss it in the lanes of Selimpur, but they provided helpful signs from the main road which led us to the place easily enough.
Now, a heads up to those who do not know what to expect here. It's a small shop, with two tables seating four each. The majority of their business seems to be take-out, so do not expect a very restaurant-y ambience. That being said, the staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcome from the start, with their polite ways and their eager recommendations.¬†
We ordered Kung Pao Pork and Bacon-wrapped Prawn. The pork was good, with a liberal amount of sauces which complemented the taste of the meat nicely.
The Bacon-wrapped Prawn was divine, the bacon smoky, the prawns juicy and the cheese dip they served it with creamy and salty, a perfect combination of flavours. I highly recommend it to anyone going there.
It was a nice experience, and I am definitely going back in the future.

A terribly failed plan, sultry weather with rain, enormous hunger and a budget crunch forced us to land up at The Hungry Tide in Dhakuria a few weeks back. At first sight, the place looked like it was actually down with yellow fever due to the colour scheme. They‚Äôd certainly hoped to bring in a lot of sunshine and warmth for their diners, but too much of it was downright off-putting in a way.  Anyhow, we sat down and ordered for a small Shepherd‚Äôs Pie and Bacon and Chicken Appasionata, which we were served after 20 minutes.

The Appasionata, not the piano sonata composed by Beethoven, but buttery fried rice was very filling to say the least. Loaded with bell peppers, bits of chicken and the sharp flavor of smoked and salted bacon, tasted pretty good. The milky cheese sauce that came with the dish enhanced its flavor by a notch. Next up was my most coveted item. Being my first tryst with a shepherd‚Äôs pie, expectations were quite high for this classic British dish. The one served here came in a medium sized foil pack and had three distinct layers; a slightly burnt and extremely thin layer of baked cheese, a considerate amount of smoothly mashed potato and the bottommost layer of minced mutton in an oily curry. It tasted really simple and maintained a huge gap from my expectations. Maybe we could blame the Appasionata that had already killed our hunger, my presumption about the pie, or simply the lack of life in it.

The prices are neither high, nor low. We hope the woman managing the shop was delighted to be paid in the handful of small change, fished out of the corner of our wallets.

This is just after you cross dhakuria bridge, towards jadavpur. Its a very small shop, mainly based on home delivery, but you can still sit and eat, max 8 people.
The risotto is especially the best. The roasted chilli pork is too good. As snacks one can explore the sandwiches, very filling and different. 5.0 is less for this joint.

Mutton was missing from the mixed grill and the chicken in it was roasted, not grilled.  Quite forgettable. The prawn tetrazzine was, however, quite good.  The delivery was late by an hour and customers are not told about delivery charges in advance, about which they are firmly unapologetic.

I will give you 10 on 5 if you increase the quantity may be in double. I had been there once and had Hawaian salad. I must say the taste was really good but I was way too disappointed to see the quantity. 200 Bucks for a small cup of salad!!! I better make it at home with 1/3rd of its cost. The place is way too costly. 
My request to the management, I know you are doing a splendid job, and i would like to order from you again, only if you take care of the quantity. Wish to try the other stuffs as well.
Cheers!!!

After reading all your reviews on zomato, i finally arrived at Hungry Tide yesterday with my friends. We were basically in search of a non ac restaurant because one of my friends had fever. I had this impression in my mind that a non ac food joint, other than a cafe or a pub, cannot be that great. But this stereotype kind of impression of mine was totally changed once i went there. The place is very clean, though it is a garage turned into a eating place. There is just 2 tables since this place is mainly for take away. we were there on a summer day at 4ish, and the place was empty.
We ordered Chicken Carbonara, Chicken Honey and Soy, veg fried rice and a Mixed Grill. The carbonara was a cheesy one instead of the eggy one that I thought before ordering. Though i liked its taste, it was a bit dry, may be Though it was good to taste, but it lacked the smokey flavor that is expected in a grill.
But hungry Tide was definitely a great experience and i would love to go there again to try their other specialty. And one suggestion, if u are going for a sit and eat thing, try to go before 5. because after that the place becomes crowded by college goers and it will be hard for u to find a seat.

True to its counterpart at Hindustan Park, this outlet is a delight. The menu seemed a bit different from the one in Hindustan Park, missing some of my favourite items. from sandwiches to pastas to chinese stir fires i love it all. the club sandwiches are scrumptious and filling at the same time. the submarines are basically hot dog buns with fillings...but the filling combinations are bang on!!! love that spinach parmesan spread!! the chinese staples are very flavorful and I am a sucker for the chilli pork...tangy spicy chunky pork....heavenly!! Among the baked products I liked the Chicken Mushroom Tetrazini, Baked Chicken and Ham, Spaghetti Carbonara. But the must try is the Grilled Fish with bacon mushroom sauce!!! flaky fish with insaleny tasty sauce. Cant miss it!!
I am yet to try the Indian Dishes and something they call Diffried Rice. But going by other elements I am hoping they will be as good. 
I love this place. Not just for the food but for the people as well. So polite and so helpful. Hungry Tide proves that good food is great when in company of the right people.

Hungry Tide is quite a blessing given the kind of dishes it serves and at a minimal price that does not hurt the pocket. My orders, twice from the place has been home delivery. Thus I shall reserve my comments about the ambience. 
Service - On our first delivery from HT, we were informed of the amount of time that will be required for the order to reach. It was on the election day and though a wait of 1.5 hours is absymal, I give it to them for informing me beforehand. On delivery, the guy apologised about being late, which was definitely nice considering they had already informed. We had ordered for risotto but was served something quite unlike it. I called them back to inform about the fiasco when the guy on the call said, "Madam, the chef says he has given the requisite amount of cheese for a risotto, think you are talking about something else." Me - "I very well know what a risotto is like. Shall upload a pic of the dish you delivered on Zomato and please decide if your chef knows well enough." So please refer to the picture with this review and figure the same out yourself. 
During the second time order, I was first narrated a delivery charge of 40 INR and later on rectified by another call as 80 INR. The latter being the right price, I had thought I was duped the first time but all was in place with the second call. Therefore I just hope and wish they correct this entire service scenario where people are arrogant and misinformed.

Food - Over both orders, I have tried the ham, bacon and spicy mayo club sandwich, mutton bolognaise, bacon risotto and fish and chips. Food for the price it is served at and the quantity delivered is impeccable. The sandwich is thick, tasty, spicy, full of ham, bacon and chicken, complementing the chips beautifully. Ask for the sandwich to be grilled and you are in for a ball. The bolognaise was as good as the one I love at Don Giovanni's. It is not comparable, I know, but it was that good. I trust only DG with bolognaise but glad to have found a lesser expensive counterpart to satiate myself. The risotto, which was not a risotto, while being something else, tasted very good. I simply gulped it though dry because of the lack of cheese. But seriously the winner was the fish and chips. Two decent fillets of real bhetki fried to perfection, served with spicy tartar sauce and fries. And yes, for 200 rupees. You possibly cannot miss ordering this!

Hungry tide definitely fills the crests of hunger beautifully! :)

We order takeout from here quite often. The food is decent, prices a bit on the higher side for some items, reasonable for others. I liked their chilly pork and hakka noodles the most. The pastas are nice but a little too sweet for my taste and the spaghetti too thick. I have also tried the baked fish which was okayish and the jacket potatoes which were awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for home delievered good quality food. The gariahat branch has a wider menu though.

This new branch is very conveniently located for us and i visited twice with my partner.
The setup is simple, no fancy dining ambiance; but the food is fetching.
The menu has new items, which delighted us.
We have had Citrus chili pork and cashew on our first visit a month back. It was nice. Meat cooked well,  flavors spot on.
The second time we went back couple of weeks later, we had Malbari pork with parathas. The pork tasted amazing. Never had pork Indian style and really liked it. It came with three non-greasy parathas  and some tomato chutney.
The food is really good here, new dishes with a bit of twist. Price is a pinch on the higher side, though no VAT which is a big relief these days. The quantity is also sufficient for two.
Overall, a very satisfactory experience.Appreciate the food they are catering.Has made its way to our regular eating options :)

Even though its a little too expensive for the quantity the ham and cheese squares are fantastic.

The only improvement that could happen is getting their zone air conditioned.
But what's the fun of having chilly pork if it doesn't make you sweat?

Haven't tried much of their menu, which has some key differences from the Purna Das road branch. The Malbari Pork and parathas was fantastic. Good quality pork, thick gravy that wasn't spilling over in oil or dalda. Parathas were foil wrapped and still hot when i received them.  The tangy pork with lime was as good as the one served at the original. . The stir-fried chicken was tasty and free of corn-flowery guck. Will try more off the new menu soon . esp. the laksa and baked dishes!

A small little place mainly for bites and takeaways. Pricey .And quantity is less.Pork quality is good .Had a sand witch also. Served in a hotdog bread rather like a sub. But not good.Need to try other dishes.Reason being the man behind the counter.Too polite and decent.May be he's the owner.Need to go back soon.Hope they improve.
