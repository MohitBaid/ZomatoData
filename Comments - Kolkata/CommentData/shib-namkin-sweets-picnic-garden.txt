Got a sweet packet from this shop. It's tough to find due to its size and clumsy look. 

The sweets here are just above average. 
Some are good some are really bad and you might get a stale one! So, for bigger purchases from small sweet shops, trying one is a golden rule! 

Pantua was harder inside with a soft red coating. 
Laddu was okay. 
The White sweet was average
Khasta Kachori was decent.

Shib Namkin & Sweets is a small confectionary  located at Picnic Garden, Kolkata.

Service is good and staff is really nice.

Tried Samosa here, which was very tasty along with the chutney served.

I liked their norom paak sondesh too.

Pocket pinch is low, which is a good thing.

Hidden treasure of this area. Tried a few sweets here. Each of them turned out to be fantastic. Sweets range from Rs.5 - Rs.10. Their Samosa is said to be very good. But when I arrived Samoa wasn't warm so I didn't try it. Try this stall for any kind of Sweets all are good.

The place where one can get garma garam kachori and samosa ...the quality of kachori available are good...after having the samosa my first comment was bhai aur ek plate lagao... they are 3 different types of chutneys also ..Prices are not so high..

You will get very good food here..especially the kachori and the aloo matar which they give in the morning..the   attitude of the shop owner is the thing which i like the most which reflects in all the foods he makes..
