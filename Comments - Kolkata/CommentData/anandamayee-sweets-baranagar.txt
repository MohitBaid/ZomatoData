Very nice and exhaustive collection of sweets. Definitely the choose one for the people living nearby. Quality and price and both optimal. During Bengali festivals like poila boishakh, jamai shoshti, bhai fota, this place seems to overcrowded with people. Have maintained their goodwill since many years. Mishti Doi, Rosogolla, Kacha Golla and Nolen Gur sandesh are among the must tries.

After getting my first salary, I bought a packet of "Moharani" and took away to my home. You can also try out the Rabri amd baked rosogollahs..

Old and famous! This is what this store is.

Providing quality sweets for years, keeping the good old stuff the same while at the same time, changing and adapting as per times. This is done by offering the old traditional sweets just how they have always been and introducing new items to the menu to satiate the needs of the new crowd.

Perhaps the reason why this store is famous And doing so well is not it's best in the class sweets but due to the uncle selling the sweets and running the show. He's very talkative and entertaining, the whole world is his friend and that's the love in his heart which makes all his sweets so lovely.

Amazing quality sweets along with excellent home-like service is the key to this place's success...

Anandamayee Sweets, is a biggie in and around Baranagar. Delicious, soft and mouthwatering 'mistanna' is a trademark item of here. You can also get Aam-Doi, Stuffed Kochuri, Dhokla and different sorts of chocolacious mishti.
Located on the B.T.Road so that your eyes can never miss it and, if you are somewhere near to this area ( Bus Stoppage : Ananya ) , Please, take a box of mishti with you to your home. Don't miss it. (Rated 4.5 based on the fact it is the best in this part of Kolkata.)

Located at Ananya cinema stop this is a well known sweet shop in baranagar. Most of us in the locality know the owner well and we are all served with utmost care in the shop.
Very special sweets are available here like mango dohi, baked rossogolla s, aam sandesh and various chocolate sweets. They also have packed rajbhogs and rasmalais. Rabri is excellent here.all sweets are pure ghee ones as evident from.the laddo. Savouries like basket chat, dhokla, stuffed kachori also available.
The only con is price is on the higher side and a little pocket pinching.

Those who have cravings for sweets must try their hands out at Anandamayee Sweets at Ananya Bus stop at Baranagar. Every sweets are worth trying for. During summer season, sweets made from Aam(Mango) should not be missed out. Baked rosogolla is another feature. Sweets made of chocolate will leave stomach more than satisfied.

My visit to the second sweet shop for the afternoon today. After seeing some good rating and positive reviews i decided to visit this place which was very near from me. It is located inside the dunlop market region, most closely to the Sonali Cinema hall at Dunlop. Very famous at this area & they have got so much to offer you.
Went inside and seen some quite a variety and new forms of sweets.
Stomach was quite filled up so just tried three of them from the many. Shop is quite small, Run by one staff who was quite talkative and friendly.
Tried the Darbes which was made of bundo, small in size, very tasty indeed and soft as well. Secondly i had the Milk cake which was nice too. Less in sweet and perfect. Lastly tried my Favourite Gulab Jamun thou a smaller one but that didnt disappoint me as well. 
The rating they have got is what they deserve according to me. Want to thanks the former reviewers for some true feedbacks.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experiece to this place.

My go to place in the locality for sweets. I love their gulab jamuns , laddoos specially. I have almost tasted all of the sweets and I used to religiously devour their radhaballavis every week. Paneer chops are also fabulous here. The make many special sweets like baked rasgolla , aam . You also get lassis here. One of the best Sweet shops in Baranagar. They could improve on their snacks line up a bit though.

The best sweet shop in Baranagar area. They offer a large variety of sweets. Their malai chomchom and mango dahi is exceptionally good. They also offer quiet good snacks and kachori all the day. They experiment with sweets and always they are successful in that. Price is little high but they never compromise with quality.

Hands down one of the best sweet shop in and around Baranagar to Dunlop locality ! Every ocassion in our house is not complete without sweets from this particular outlet ! The thing that is worth mentioning is the variety of sweets they serve you! Each time we go there we are spoilt for choice! Their Am doi or Mango curd is of exquisite variety. I even once had a green sweet from there which looked like "Potol" with kheer er pur or stuffed with Kheer , which was just heavenly ! The staff is quite courteous and the shop itself is very well maintained with A.C interiors! All in all a hub for all the mishti lovers of the a fore mentioned area! Highly recommended!

Anandamayee Sweets is a place which gives true Ananda(Happiness) to Mishti(Sweet) Lovers :P

*Location - It is located at Ananya Bus Stop,B.T. Road. A nice location I must say. And pretty close to my residence.

*Brief - My Ma is very fond of the sweets here, I have been tasting their sweet items since my childhood and they have been really awesome.

*Ambience/Decor - Its a pretty well maintained shop with a separate cash counter as well. They are also having AC :P
The people running the shop are courteous and well behaved.

*Specialities - Their specilaties are the Sandesh and Rash Malais. Just marvellous is one word to describe the "sweets". Also they have a special variety of Doi(Curd) known as "Aam Doi"(mango curd) which is one of its kind in Kolkata. They have also introduced Keshariya Kulfi which is worth mentioning :)

A very much recommended place for Mishti lovers :)
Enjoy :)

i love their gur sandesh ,talsash though it may be a little high priced yet the sweets are itself so tasty that the cost doesnt matter...their kaju barfi is one of my favourite..i have tried their rasomalai which is one of a kind...their son papri is made of pure ghee and it is too good...i love their rabri which is made so perfectly that one cant resist their desire from having more of it...
they even serve kachori and tarkari and jalebis which are as tasty as their other sweets..if u have love for sweets do try anandamayee then u will never be dissapointed coz the price u pay for such sweets are worth it...:D
