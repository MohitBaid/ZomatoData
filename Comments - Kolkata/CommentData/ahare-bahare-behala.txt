Pocket friendly. Initially I had a doubt but later I found the taste is freaking good. Little suggestion - please cook it less spicy(I mean less chilli) so that kids could equally enjoy the food together. Otherwise the dal jhuri alu bhaja, egg kosha is simply mouth watering.

Good packaging. Food is great. Fresh and well prepared. Bit spicy but it's ok. Will recommend. The fish preparations are really nice. You can expect fresh meals. I have never found stinking smell as mentioned above. A good corner to try your appetite. I have ordered more than ten times and  am really satisfied. Will look forward for more inclusions in their menu. A must try.

in Radhaballavi + Alu Kabli we got 2 pcs Radhaballavi and Alu Kabli (300 ml) 

review;
in Veg Thali (Aam Dal) Veg Pakoras was worse the other one more type sabji was stale smelling other than that all was okish!
in Karaisutir Kachuri + Cholar Daal the Karaisutir Kachuris were made of atta which made it worse the Cholar Daal was stale smelling and it was too too much spicy literally my mouth was burning
in Radhaballavi + Alu Kabli same as the above the Radhaballavis were made of atta and Alu Kabli was okish but again it was spicy

we also mentioned not to make food spicy but... had a lot of expectations from Ahare Bahare but......

after having such food we all were feeling uneasy.....

PS the packaging was good but it made us to sweat while opening the seals...

Nice food quantity.  Packaging is good.  The quality is beautiful.  Someone will find the bengali dishes quite Spicy and Oily but i believe the bengali or indian foods are very much incomplete without oil and spice. Have tried their Hash er Dim Crab Polao till date.  Will definitely try out more.  And will add reviews.
