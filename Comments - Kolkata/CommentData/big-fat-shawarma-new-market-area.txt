Located opposite to Scoop, and beside Tea Junction. Had chicken shawarma roll and sandwich. The sandwiches hardly had any chicken ,it was only filled with lots of capsicum and onions.  The roll was better compared to the sandwich.

A shararma roll, not something you find as a street food in Kolkata. Had my first experience with shawarma rolled up in a tortilla.

Ordered a cheesy panner shawarma, was delighted with cheese and mostly mayo filled in it. Panner peices was tasty, though wanted more in it. It looses a rating point with the fact that it was microwaved at-last and served and not hot from the stand.
The tortilla had too much flour that came in my hand though.
Would definitely try the burger and sandwiches too on further visits.

The Big Fat Shawarma , just located in the lane opposite Shreeram Arcade and beside the City Mart in Esplande is a newly opened counter. Someone who has got bored eating momos or pizzas or KFC's chicken  or South Indian food whenever you r in Esplande then this is the right place for you. This wraps filled with chicken and mayonnaise will give you an oomph to your taste buds and certainly this will be something new if you haven't tasted shawarma rolls before. There's a lot of variety available like the Classic Chicken Shawarma, Mayo Chicken Shawarma, Cheese Chicken Shawarma and so on. This is even cheaper compared to what you can find in other places. The average prize for a single wrap is around 90-100. They also have veg recipes and Burgers as well. So this puja season whenever you're visiting Esplanade for shopping , Lok for this store and enjoy the delicious wraps.

It's a small shop located among the other food joints in a narrow lane in new market. Tried their mayo chicken shawarma. It tasted good and the size was big.

After a long stroll at esplanade.. I found this place serving swawarma. 
I am a huge fan of Lebanese food, but seeing the reviews I was quite unsure of visiting it. 
However I went and ordered chicken mayo swawarma. 
No less than a perfect roll, except that chicken were cube shaped and not shredded. 
Costed me 95 only. 
And taste was amazing.

A small road ride food joint. It's in the lane beside the new empire, Esplanade. The service was very slow, waited for about 40 mins to have our chicken salad. The concept of shawarma doesn't fit at all. Don't expect like other shawarma's. The price is low and space of improvement is more.

The only Shawarma Kiosk in New Market area located just beside Scoop which can be found close to City Mart.

A small roadside stall so there is nothing to go in details . I ordered a plate of Chicken Shawarma Salad and it was prepared in the worst possible way . After trying out almost every Shawarma centres in Kolkata , it was Big Fat Shawarama who introduced me to a whole new type of dish which they call "Shawarma" .

Here they won't be serving you the salad withoutâ€‹ pita bread . When asked about this their answer was check the picture in the menu , we sont serve pita bread . How pathetic an answer can be .

Secondly the shawarma chicken was sliced in diced pieces which is absolutely not how you should be slicing for a shawarma . 

Tomato slices , lettuce and etc were hard to find and mayonnaise was slightly used . 

I would suggest everyone to save your money and get something else . Maybe the amount is low but you can get better items in that lane and you wont be disappointed . 

Thank You .

One of the worst shawarmas I have ever tasted. It was dry, the chicken was tough, the pita bread too tasted stale. Would never recommend anyone to have food here of all places.

No, I didn't like the Shawarma that I ordered. It was mayo chicken Shawarma. Price was 90 bucks, I found it quite high. It was not even filling. I would rather have a chicken roll from a road side shop and be done with it.

This is a nice small stall besides Tea Junction near New Market Area. We had ordered Mayo chicken Shawarma and Chicken shawarma Salad. The Salad was toasty and the Shawarma roll was good and spicy. They have few sitting arrangement outside and the service is quick and prompt. An excellent place for a quick break.

It is located in the new market area besides tea junction. It is a small kiosk with few seatings on the outside.We ordered cheesy chicken shawarma and spicy chicken shawarma. The flavour was nice and tasted good. The spicy chicken was literally spicy. The service was prompt. This can be considered as an amazing place at affordable price to have quick bites.
