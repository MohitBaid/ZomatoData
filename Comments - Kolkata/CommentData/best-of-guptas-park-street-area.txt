Quite economical joint...Courteous Staffs and decently spacious.... Food is quite satisfactory...They need to work on the service speed as the food takes a few score of minutes to arrive on the table...Overall, worth giving a try....

Just a 2 minutes walk from the Park Street Music world junction, this place is a must visit for people looking for drinks and tasty kebabs at reasonable prices. I loved their Tangri Kebab preparation . Even the fried rice was much above average. They have 2 separate sections, so the ambience is good enough and its less crowded compared to its counterparts. The waiters are quite friendly too. So Overall- surely worth a visit!

If you are looking for a place to sit after work with a drink with some good munchies & like-minded colleagues-turned-buddies, and and want to avoid the fuss of those over-hyped Park St joints yet being close to Park St, then this place is highly recommended.

Stewards are cordial. 

Place is neatly done, and soooo peaceful. 

As a Vegetarian, I prefer their Aloo Chat, Mushroom Sauté & Stuffed Tandoori Aloo.

My friends speak highly of their Garlic Chicken. Chicken Tangri Kebab looks juicy with optimal tenderness.

Price point-wise you should find this place if not economic, a preferred one near Park St for its peaceful ambience.

This is one of those fuss free places with a dull ambience and not so good food. Everything is pretty average out there but not so bad either. The stuff they serve is easy on your pockets though!

One of those places that is quite okay but doesn't pull you back for more. The place is quite neat,with pocket friendly prices and well prepared Mughlai cuisines. However, with so many legendary places to eat in the New market area, this places fails to catch your attention, if you are not a regular here. The service is pretty okay and they have a few specialties depending upon the chef, but if you are not one of those regulars here, this place might fail to catch your attention.

One of our all tym favourite restaurant!! Cant dcd whr to go and this is one such plc which pops up immediately !! This is one such restaurant where we not only gt the bestest indian  food but also an excellent chinese cuisine! It serves one of the bestest naan and the bestest chicken hunan, chicken chilli, chicken reshmi masala, chicken bharta.. And the list goes on.. Although i prsnlly didnt lyk the paneer tikka as it was jst too bland.. The rest of the items u cn go on ordering without any hesitance.. The fried rice are grtt too.. It has one of the finest rice.. I personally dont lyk much of the ambience but it delivers an excellent pocket friendly food. The staff is frndly and ready to help u anytym !! Highly recommended !!

This place doesn't make you want to come back and visit it again. Its not bad, but it isn't good either. The dishes are not overpriced, nor does the food taste bad. But it is very dull and I believe that fine dining is not only about how the food tastes. How the restaurant involves your senses, how it helps you make great memories and how nostalgic it makes you feel, are very important parameters for judging a restaurant. For example, eating something as simple as Gol Bari's "kosha mangsho" with parathas, while crusing on the Ganges on a dingy near Princep Ghat would make one feel that his life is awesome. For me, its very simple. A restaurant that fails to add a zing in my mood, is simply not worth going to.

veg sweet corn soup: nice
veg fried rice: Simple and nice with loads of peas
veg noodles: simple and nice
veg manchurian: soft balls of veg without much flour, again a good one

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this place existed on Zomato. A particular division of our company used to have its office in that neighborhood and I used to drop in to Gupta's on a frequent basis for a couple of drinks and starters. Many a times we have ended up having dinner. Its bang on Mirza Ghalib Street and is difficult to miss.
The service is efficient and quick and the staff were quite courteous, not just to us regulars but even to customers who would occasionally have a drink too many. My favourites were the Fish Baroda and Fish Fingers, both of which came in more than generous portions and were equally delicious. I have had some of the kebabs here which were decent but not worth the price. The mutton seekh kebabs and barra kebabs are two names that come to mind instantly. Only regret that I have with regards to this place is that I have never tried the brain dishes. If I merely even uttered the word 'brain' people would freak out. And since no one was willing to share I would not dare to order because I am a small eater and it would be a shame to waste brain masala. Someday I hope I can try it there as brain masala is available in a handful no. of places in Kolkata. Overall a decent place for the price that they charge.

This is one of our favorite family restaurant when it comes to North Indian food. Whenever we have relatives or friends visiting us from outside Kolkata/India, we take them to this restaurant. 
It is not a very hype restaurant, but it serves the best food. Ambiance is ok, I like the background music that they play (Usually instrumental of English songs)

We dont need the menu card when we go there because we are so familiar with the place. 
Drink (non-alcoholic)- Pineapple Blossom. Must try!
Starters: Fish Baroda (Fried fish, topple with cheese and white sauce, and baked) Out of this world. Check out the pictures.
              Mutton Bara Kebab
              Brain Pakoda (I simple love it)  :)
Main Course: Mutton Rogan Josh
                      Reshmi Butter masala
                      Special brain masala
                      Peas Pulao
                      Kabuli Naan (if you like sweet naans with dry fruits and nuts)
The veg items like Paneer butter masala and aloo gobhi are good.
Desserts: Tutti Frooti Ice-cream

The bill will come between 2000-2400- The above is for 5-6 people.A meal for one would cost around 400-450 (look at the variety and the number of dishes). Its pretty reasonable compare to other restaurants in Park Street.
