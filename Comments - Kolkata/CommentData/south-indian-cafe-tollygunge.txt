I ordered onion uttapam here which was a little sour....else the qaulity seemed nice....coconut and tomatoe chutney are good, sambhar is average.....try it out if the ambience doesn't matter to you...

Located at Mudiali area, Tollygunge , serves South Indian snacks at a reasonable price.

Service is prompt.

Tried Aloo vada, which was crispy and tasty.

Overall a satisfying experience.

South Indian Cafe is a take away joint which serves South Indian dishes at an affordable price. 

It is located in Tollygunge near Mudiali 

Ambience is shabby but service is prompt.

Tried Aloo vada & dahi vada. Aloo vada was crispy and was yummy. Dahi Vara was very tasty and chatpata.

Overall a nice place.

Ordered aloo vada and Masala dosa from this outlet on the 1st day of 2017. The dishes were reasonable priced. The aloo vada has a crisp outer coverage unlike those soggy ones. The special attraction for me was the extra tomato red chutney served. The marsala dosa was equally tasty with sufficient filling of the potato curry. All in all a satisfying food experience.

Tried their masala Dosa via delivery. The food was pretty average! The sambhar n chutney were okay and somehow the Dosa wasn't tasting too well. Possible that the delivery made it very soggy. But overall the food experience was quite average. Finally saw the place one day and was not happy with the open kitchen. It is almost a roadside eatery. Regretted ordering from here ( looked very unhygienic) 

Giving this a miss!

I have visited this place many times, as it is near my house. Good South Indian food is available here at cheap prices. Though you won't find the cooking very hygienic. That being a big minus point for a restaurant which is situated on the road. Speciality here is Butter Masala Dosa. Not a bad place though if you are a foodie.

Quantity of cheese wasn't satisfactory.
I tried through swiggy home delivery.
Delivery was fast.
Pocket friendly.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

This place is near to my house so i get a chance to visit it once in a month atleast.
So today I ordered for 2 plates of dahi vada.
Unfortunately only one plate was left. I had to have one only!
taste- 8/10
ambience- 4/10
cost - very very cheap.
It needs a good decoration.
MAy b a bit of variety in sounth indian foods.
The place is too small to have seating availability!
I will recommend the place only if you are too hungry and have only 50-60 rs in your pocket.

Nice place to grab some south food if you passing by mudiali area. prices are quite cheap  Downpoint you have to stand and eat with your food resting on a rack

I get discounts from this shop as the owner had taken the plot on rent from my uncle…dahi vadas are too good…even the uttapams and dosas are good enough for a meal

Sub standard food. Not worth the while. Roadside vendors deliver better quality
