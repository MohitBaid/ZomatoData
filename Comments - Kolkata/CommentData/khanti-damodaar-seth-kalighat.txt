This place just before this year's Durga Puja. Yellow Pulao, Macher matha diye dal, Mutton Kasha, Ilish bhapa, Golda Chingri were the items that I tried at this place. Food was tasty and well cooked. The Ilish was perfect! The mutton could have been a tad tender. There is a good balance in flavour. One who is looking for a good Bengali meal should try this place.Â 

P.S. - The entrance & waiting area is well decorated and guests are given a warm welcome.
