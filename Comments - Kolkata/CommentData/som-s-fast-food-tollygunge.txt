One of the few fast food counters in my own locality which caters to our appetite.Its a small joint but a pleasant one.The staff is cordial and food is tasty.However the menu is normally constricted like most other similar joints,still a bliss for the ones in vicinity.
Happy eatingðŸ˜Š

Im really surprised to see Som's Fast Food listed in Zomato and with that it also feels good that, that Zomato not only lists big hotels and restaurants but also local fast food shops and sweets shops. It is one of the fast food shop of my locality. Initially when it was opened 2-3 years back everything was so good and well maintained. The staff.s, cook and food quality used to be very good and tatsy initially. I use to frequently have momo, chicken chowmein, moghlai paratha from there and my favourite was chicken lollipop. They use to make awesome chicken lollipop. But later on with time passing by, with lack of proper maintenance and management, everything has been degraded. The shops looks so shaby and unclean now a days. The old staffs and good cooks are not there anymore. Â All the items mentioned in the menu card is also not available anymore everytime. I also dont find my favourite chicken lollipop available many a times.
