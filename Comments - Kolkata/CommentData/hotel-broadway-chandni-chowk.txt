Very sophisticated and a vintage bar cum restaurant in the Central Kolkata area. Liked the ambiance a lot. Food quality and the service are very good as well. From price perspective also it's quite reasonable. Would love to visit again for sure.

The dirt cheap price tags, quaint broadway finish arrangement, chandeliers and a bunch of weary patrons -- this is Broadway for you. Unlike any coming of the age bars, Broadway preserves its old-world charm with finesse. The wooden furtinure, dimly lit lamps, the uniformed bar tenders, all reek of the days of yore. It's ideal for a cozy hangout sessions with your ftiends and colleagues. Apart from the booze, the food menu is quite surprising. Try Chicken Kiev Cutlet and Fish Fingers for starters.

One of the oldest and a heritage pub of Kolkata. The day one feels of running out of money.. 'the place' one must visit then. The drinks you will get here at the cheapest rates. And on top food is amazing too. Chicken Satay and Topsey fry is my top favorite dish in this restaurant... Every time i have walked in... Have never missed to order these food items... you will get 1500 ml draught beer just for 500 bucks... Crowd is decent... This place is on must visit list for all travellers... Have seen numerours foreigners enjoying their drinks here... This is really a great place to hang out, when Mr. N. Singh is not there. He abuses his customers, Don't know how to behave. Allen m really sorry, he behavior for last two days has ruined my entire good experiences. Travellers i will say, if only You wanna get harrashed by Mr. Singh.. thn visit this place and good luck.

Perfect place for weekend hangout with friends, when your budget is little short ;)
Popular for draught beer tower. Food is okay and ambiance is normal.
This is a place in G.C.Avenue where as far as I know, the great Uttam Kumar used to drink. Now this is renovated, but you can feel that nostalgia when you will look around

Ideal place to relax with a glass of wine or pint of beer in a cozy , old schooled, low light ambience dining hall and to delve in the serious philosophical postulate that why in the earth after paying the meagre restaurant bills at the end of every month you run low on fund! (the place is damn cheap). The service staffs are co operating and gentle. Food is good with reasonable price . Conveniently located close to Chandni Metro Station this is a paradise for home bound working population of Chandni-Dalhousie area!!

Only flipside is they don't serve any complimentary with the drinks and you have to purchase peanuts or bhujia separately... grrr.. :-)

The ambience gives you a taste of an old Calcutta pub. Food is good enough and alcohol is kinda cheap. Overall a good place to visit if you plan to get drunk and also take in somewhat delicious food. But service should be better!

This place is exactly situated at the opposite of chandni chowk metro. 

This place has a old world charm . If you have drink chill and munch in mind , come to this place. Specially if you like the old school look and feel the dim lights. And am in love with it !  

We have been there only for the alcohol purpose ! so cant give a review on their culinary items! But if I have to choose from OLY PUB or BROADWAY anyday I will go for BROADWAY ! Leaving aside the emotional attachment with beef steak from OLY ! 😂 

ULLASH !

One of the best bar in the area.
The waiters are a bit slow in service and also not polite , but still its the best, good food , nice drinks options , they serve draught beer also.
You might get difficulty in getting place in weekdays evening.
The dim light , old fashioned interiors , simple wooden table add a difference to this place.

So many years of Pub hopping, and how this place had escaped me is a mystery.. Takes you back to the Old Classic Calcutta. Carefully maintained over the years, the high ceilings, big glass windows have not changed. The walls have been painted and air conditioning have been added to smartly attract the new age clients who need basic amenities. The service personnel wearing uniforms so typical to old cal restaurants and clubs, are well behaved and will make you feel special. Coming to the f & b, I had decided to go for the simple chicken cutlet being the first time to the place and some draught beer. The food was hot and beer was fresh..Had a great couple of hours just enjoying the new age ambience in this old world romance. I also liked the lighting which was warm and perfectly lit, not too bright or dreary ..Will definitely go back to this place.

Square wooden tables, classical windows, high ceilings, dimly lit interiors, safari suit attired stewards and everything in a rewind! Broadway greets you in a style such as this. Old Calcutta at it's best. Introduced to me last year by my school friends, this iconic address at Chadni Chowk is now close to my heart. A pub. Rather, a bar stuck in a beautiful time warp. A place where thousands of stories unfold, a place where hearts are broken, a place where honest tears are shed, a place where relationships are mended and a place where alcoholic confessions are made. An addictive charm that just grows on you with time. 

I never imagined I could have my old monk with bread toast (with a pinch of sugar on it). That's Broadway for you! With respect to food, there is nothing great to write back home. But their masala peanuts, egg sandwich and chicken jhalfarezi is worth a try. Not recommended for meals, this place serves you with reasonably priced domestic alcohol.

With newer bunch of age group of flocking in, Broadway has introduced set menus and specials for the day.Beer towers and pitchers have also been introduced along with becoming air conditioned, which makes it little pacey than before. But I would still love to believe the place has a magic.

To trippy nights. To Calcutta. To Broadway.

Broadway is one of the most pocket friendly AC watering holes in Kolkata. Located at the heart of Chandni Chowk, Ganesh Avenue, this Bar cum Restaurant is one comfort cocoon, after a hard day's work. It exudes an old British era charm, but will surprise you with its new age beer tower. The food has become more tasty, after their recent revamp. Whether you love to have rice and dim er jhol with your Beer, or you love the traditional kebab and whisky- they have it all. Their Mutton and Chicken kebabs are amazing. Fish is at times a disappointment. But over all, Broadway will keep your heart and pocket oh-so-tipsy and happy. Happy Drinking!
                    

P.S. Did I mention that you can also eat Butter Toast with your favourite liquor, yeah they serve that too. They are just champions of comfort drinking.

See it's not always about the highly sophisticated nature of the place or the high quality of service. You might even get cursed if you don't give a good tip. But this is a place we go over and over again. You can speak your heart out as loud as you want. Cheap drinks and 'chaaknas' (Masala Peanut) . Everyone is happy and busy in their on conversation. Meet up with old friends and have a good time here ,that's it!

Not very difficult to locate, this bar cum restro is situated in chandni chowk. 

Ambience : not very lavishly decorated, large seatings with dim lights. Worn out walls and old furnitures. More of 'old school' types. Peaceful. (:

Drinks : costs less here than I can think of any other place. Old Monk Large is for 85 ;) 

Food : tried their dry chilly chicken, French fries for starters. Mixed fried rice and schezwan lamb for main course. Good taste and Nicely cooked. 

Hospitality : Warm and friendly people here. They even went ahead and prepared us badam chaat on request. :P

To sum it up.. Pocket friendly price and cozy ambience.

As i was staying in Hotel Broadway i went to the Restaurant.
6 of us landed their at Dinner time.
The Broadway Hotel : A Vintage Place,with Decent Crowd,Tasty Food,Dim Lights and Reasonable Bar.
No Air Conditioners,No TV,No Loud Music,No Fancy Stuffs.But a peaceful and ancient place where you can have your drink and food with your near and dear ones peacefully.
We odered,
Dry Chilli Chicken, Chicken Masala, Chicken Dopiaza and Butter Chappati.
One of the best Chilli Chicken i have ever tried.
Butter Chappati was soft.
Chicken Masala was pretty good.
So satisfied with the food.
Really fresh ingredients and well composed flavours with an attention to detail and comfort.
Everything is cheap here and was touched by the service.
Overall a must visit for a person seeking a true Calcutta Experience.
Will definitely visit this place again.

Broadway is one of the quality and reasonable Bars in Kolkata. My personal favourite, this place has an outstanding ambience ( no Air Conditioner, but you don't need it). The drinks are reasonable and the staffs are nice. They don't serve complimentary snacks with drinks, now thats a negative part. My personal favourite delicacy here is the "Dry Chilli Chicken". A wonderful place to booze.

We went as a party of five and while four decided to drink, I decided to devote myself to the food section. 

I ordered a chicken stew, chicken pakodas and some of their special fried chicken.

The stew was pleasant, very nice for someone like me who was recovering from a fever. Very bland and soupy.

The pakodas were nice and crispy on the outside, with a maida/besan batter and soft and moist on the inside. We all gobbled it up with the onion slices that was served with it. 

Finally the Fried Chicken was something out of this place. It was delectable!!

The place has a very vintage feel and of course the staff was very polite and courteous, getting the work done chop chop chop!

Overall I must say that there is great value for money spent here.

Being a first timer to write a feedback on zomato, credit definitely goes to zomato itself. As it gave me a new destination for hangout in kol. This  place definitely one of the best places if you are looking for some boozing time but want to go easy on pocket. The environment overall quite nice along with the service and decent crowd. Gives you a feeling of old kolkata. We ordered for two bottle beer, dry chili chicken (awesome taste) and potato fries which had cost us Rs. 530 only whereas the same we got almost at Rs. 900 in some of the over hyped Bars in kolkata. Highly recommended.

When u go through that narrow glass door, u don't just go into a restaurant. You step inside a time bubble which is a few decades into the past, when this city was called Calcutta. It's lighting makes u feel u r in an old yellowed photograph. It lacks maintenance, as it happens with old places, but the food is cheap, tasty and the service quick. Definitely recommended.

Personalities like Mahanayak Uttam Kumar used to visit here for drinks.Really loved the vintage old Kolkata look to it.Takes you back to colonial times.It may not be air-conditioned..but the crowd is very decent.Its absolutely safe for girls.Its a good place to grab few drinks and have long session of adda with friends.We had whiskeys and beers here couple of times.Prices are dirt cheap.We also had some munchies along side like finger chips,onion pakora,dry chilli chicken.All of them were pretty good.The finger chips they serve are potato wedges seasoned with some masala which is a welcome change from the regular packaged French fries.
Will visit them soon.

Hotel Broadway is quintessential Calcutta. Drop in on a winter's afternoon and you can experience it yourself. With the light streaming in through the large windows the restaurant inspires you to take things easy, read a book or write to a friend. And then comes the simple yet soul satisfying food. Life seems pretty good here. Don't miss out on the special fried chicken, aloo paratha and chicken masala.

Broadway is a place where one can have the taste of old city bar . It is a rare place to drink in the middle of the town at such affordable prices. Foods are not upto the mark. My rating is only basis of its drinks and it's touch of old city fashion with .

Went here with a big group of friends this Panchami. The old world charm of the place was quite enjoyable.
One of my friends had an unpleasant experience with the ordering though. He asked for aloo paratha and the server retorted quite rudely to him. He had to settle for buttered toast 😐
Coming to the other food items, the chicken sandwich was good, but nothing great. The paneer bhurji was also okayish. The alcohol being served was value for money.
But, the dish that will stay with me is the chilly chicken. It was one of the best I have had, period.
All in all a nice experience.

Visited this restaurant today with couple of my friends , good place to hangout and drink some booze.. Very boring and vintage kind of ambience with dim lighting . They didn't had any proper food so we ordered dry chilli chicken with booze which was surprisingly good ..

A cheap watering hole with a retro worn out look, this is an old establishment which has retained a steady bunch of loyal customers through out the years. The drinks are pretty cheap, and that makes up for the ordinary quality of the food/snacks. The absence of air conditioning is a big let off, though the ventilation is better than in other non-ac restaurants. There waiters are OK, though the glasses for serving the drinks could be much better. Recommend only for economical drinking sessions.

Cheap booze, an interesting ambience, tasty food and incredibly friendly staff makes this place a amazing option for those seeking drink and grub on a budget. The fact that it's located just opposite a metro station(Chadni Chowk Gate No. 6) makes it very easy to access. Overall a must visit for a person seeking a true Calcutta experience.
            

Recommended Food - ChilI Chicken, Chicken Cutlet

Tired of drinking in and around our college campus, me and my Boyfriend are constantly on the lookout for cheap beer and good cafés to hangout and eat finger food from. We love sitting over glasses of beer and talk about idontknowwhat.

Broadway, is one such perfect hangout for us.
Sick of OlyPub we made Braodway our adda lately, because of its Carlsberg@150 and well, cheap finger food.

I know the place lacks air conditioning but what the hell, it isn't so hot indoors owing to the Victorian Architecture it has. It's got this regal feel to it, and add to that the classy intellectual old men gathering in it to sip some ethanol ! Also, this place doesn't have the occasional drunk lecher who makes women uncomfortable by staring at them.

All said and done, this is a really cool place to sit and chat and sip cold beer. Cheers !

I have been to Broadway or as formally say, Hotel Broadway on many occasions with friends. This place is not properly a family getaway but if we want to have drinks at a calm and quite place, so this is it. Their foods are also good. The ambience of this place is really good. It is said that this is the oldest pub of Kolkata. I would recommend this place to everyone, who loves their liquor in peace.

I came in for lunch, and was thoroughly satisfied and impressed with the food. Yes I said food, no drinks were ordered and no bar snacks were consumed. Even though it's known for its bar, Broadway Hotel (not Hotel Broadway) serves some very good, clean and amazingly priced food. 
Try the rice, dal, saag paneer and chicken cutlet or fried fish. A real home style meal is what you'll get. Really fresh ingredients and well composed flavours with an attention to detail and comfort. I highly recommend the dining room at the Broadway for an authentic Calcutta experience.

Located in chandni chowk opposite mission cafe and the metro rail outlet, this is one of the oldest bars in the city and still has got the old touch and feel to it

Not very clean and decorative but its is okay to pay a visit and have a drink and snack wid friends,

Food wise its average but where it scores is its cost and pocket pinch which seems quite comfortable for people at the end of the month.

One of the oldest bars in town, having a very dim lighting. It was cool enough on a summer night without having an AC, so thumbs up for that. The food is fine, I had the chili paneer it was nice. A nice place to hangout, also with a tight budget. 

The catering staff was however disappointing. Will definitely visit again!

This is not one of those fancy places that you would come with a date. The ambience has nothing appealing in it. The service is friendly but nothing special. But what makes this place a steal is the prices. At this quality, I can assure that there are few places with just price and such good food. Although I haven't tasted everything here. The fried chicken is good. The best part, though was the delicious chilly chicken that made me return to this place for two more times. Dit people like me who love spicy food, and are okay to find in an okayish environment this is a must try dish here.
Even the alcohol is cheap. For example, I haven't got 60ml of old monk for ₹75 anywhere else.
The place is really good. Only issue is that they can improve the environment by renovating. Adding air conditioners, and keeping the place cleaner can go a long way.

Have to give this place a 5 out of 5 for nostalgic reasons as well as for the management who have been able to hold on to the leashes of maintaining quality on a constant basis. The decor transports you back to old calcutta .. While you sip on some fine whiskey or chug down your cold beer . Also don't forget to munch on some of their side dishes or mains. The food tastes great it's a simple no frills menu . I personally like to sink my teeth in the special chilly chicken , the chicken kiev, the jhal freizi and the masala peanuts . It's total easy on your pockets too. The staff is very friendly some times a little slow because they  still maintain the easy going colonial pace. Most of the regulars are very ancient .. mostly government employees and have their marked places to sit down every evening. This I suppose was a watering hole for the hard working clerks under the raj who would come in for quick drink and bite after a hard days work. Waiting to visit this place again and having an adda session with my friends over some beer and some quintessential booze food.

Sink in the old time sofas, stretch your legs, sip through your favourite beer...indulge munching some great side dishes...and just meditate through the good time you are having at the moment !!! 

That's "Broadway" for me !!!

Pocket friendly price tag, quick service, quality food...& neo-liberal colonial solace...would you hesitate to rate the place below "5-Bud" ??? You may, but I call you a 'lost soul' then buddy... 🤓

Being a Vegetarian- I can recommend the Veg- Cutlet (2pcs in a plate) a must try...this I am stating after having tried the same item at many of the biggies & not so famous joints as well...

The Green Salad was refreshingly fresh...

French Fries were 'sensuously' crispy... 🍻

Visiting these kind of places makes you think - "Life is short...and who cares for a re-birth !!! "

Wouldn't have known about this place but for a senior who recommended it for cheap booze.
Stepping in, it felt like we had stepped back in time and were back in old Calcutta. No fancy, flashy gimmicks here. The place has a really nice old-world charm, with nice sofas, low tables and pretty dim lighting. Booze is basically dirt-cheap if you compare it to other watering holes. Coming to the food, really liked the fish fingers. BEWARE: No complimentary snacks served here.
The waiters are pretty ancient, dressed in old, faded uniforms, but are quite courteous. Service was a bit slow, but not a deal-breaker. Would definitely visit again for a pint with close friends...
                    

UPDATE:
This place has now become a regular "thhek" for us. They have recently upgraded the menu as well as the facilities; you can now enjoy chilled draught beer and partake of a whole new Chinese food section. Prices have increased just a tiny bit. Kudos to the management who have succeeded in retaining the ambience of the place even after so long in business.

Visited this Bar cum Restro many a times in the past and every time it pleases me with its cool ambience. You get good hard drinks in a cheaper price. The most unique thing is that they serve cucumber and carrot as a complimentary side dish with the hard drinks. But now I think they do not serve that anymore. Coming to that of food, I have tasted the most common ubiquitous dish which is Chilli Chicken and believe me it does taste very palatable. All in all its a very pocket friendly bar cum restro and I would go with 3.5 stars!

It's not always easy to compliment friends, nor is it in this case. My friend works there. Therefore I must say that it sucks. But I can't. It's location is the business district reminds one of how Calcutta also used to be. You'd leave from Presidency college, cross the road go over to coffee house, (FYI :below which we have a book shop) leave after you've seen and said which you wanted and head over to Broadway for a drink. This is how I imagine college life scores of years ago. Thankfully this place still exists and it's run with loving care. Before I forget they make food too! Not to be missed! Next time you go there include me in your plans! Went there for lunch recently, it's cool inside while it's not outside.

Every time I visit Broadway its like a time travel..Its really hard to imagine for those who haven't visited this bar thjat still an old world british pub like this still exists in the city..Its located just opposite to Chandi Metro in an age old Hotel and the decor reminds you of Victorian Kolkata (Calcutta sounds better).. The decor, the ambiance is quite soothing and you feel a different charm here..Though the interior isn't anything flashy and more importantly even in this age we don't find an a.c. working most of the time still this place has a character of its own..Its only when you feel the vibes you will start to adore this bar..The service is pretty smooth..the waiters are well informed,suggests exactly what u need with your booze..Coming to the food they basically serves finger food like Dry Chilli Chicken, Masala Peanut, Fish Masala or Fish Finger.. The alcohol is really cheap here and to top it they don't charge any extra vat ..Overall a highly recommended for those still searching for a moment of laziness amidst the clamours of the fast paced life..

The only thing I regret is that I found out about this place too late. Stepping foot into Broadway makes you feel like you just travelled through a portal to a quieter, gentler, higher-ceilinged Kolkata than the one you're used to. The service staff listens to your order and always recommends what they think you should try - they don't walk around with a dismissive attitude (which I've faced waiters doing at all the other supposed 'cult' bars or restaurants in the city). The bar has been full the two times I've gone, but somehow never noisy. The finger food is brilliant - a plate of French fries and a Carlsberg Strong can make a surprisingly efficient meal. Also recommend the Fish Fingers. Just one teeny tiny recommendation for the management - tomato ketchup instead of pumpkin sauce and gin on the menu please. 
Otherwise, beautiful place I'm going to keep frequenting, and if you haven't started yet, you should too.

One of the older watering holes in the city conveniently located bang in heart of the city a stones throw from the Metro Station. If your idea of a bar is Someplace Else then please dont visit but if you like Olypub then chances are you will like Broadway. I am not much of a drinker but my friends visit often for a few drinks before we head to Eau Chew for dinner. Booze is cheap and the atmosphere very ordinary. The fish fingers and chilly chicken are decent as are the chicken cutlet and chicken sandwich.

A very nice and cosy place with good ambience and far from noise.. Hopped in at a sunday afternoon with my cousins. Good service from the waiters. The bar is of a very good standard, all that are mentioned in the menu are available. Suitable for girls as well. Gives a feeling of that old calcutta bar consisting of a big surrounding, old fashioned furnitures, and soft lighting that allows the perfect mood to settle in.. Very reasonable prices compared to other places within that area. A must visit for those who like to have a peg or two in a cosy environment..

First things first, if it were not for Zomato we would have never come to know of this place neatly tucked in on the corner of G.C.Avenue and Central avenue crossing.

First impression : Coffee house only a bit cleaner and serving alcohol.

Food : Well cooked. Tasty. And most importantly its homely. Only thing missing on the menu might be Butter Chicken. I mean when you say you serve only North Indian...you cannot run a resto without Butter chicken or tikka masala. Overall 3.5/5

Service : Good. Cheerful waiters. But just like all places with a heritage, the waiters are rude enough to linger around your table for tips. This has got to stop!! Overall 2/5.

Price : The menu looked cheap. But the final bill was little on the higher side. Overall : 3.5/5

So, all in all a nice place to have a few drinks with nice munchies.

I had dropped in at this place one afternoon for lunch with a bottle of beer since had gone to Chandni area for some work.

A very old hotel - I just liked the ambience -   it was absolutely different: Huge ceiling height at least 2 and a half times of our modern ceiling heights ! From the ceiling  iron rods are hung at the end of which is attached ceiling fans ! The place is pretty big and at least 15 such fans are hung ! 

It felt as if I was in college street coffe house - just that the beer mug replaced the coffee mug !!

I had a Budweiser and asked the staff what should I have if I wanted to have very little oil. He suggested Chicken stew and so I ordered -

Chicken stew was really yummy - a big chicken leg , vegetables . The stew was well prepared 

Do drop in if you want to have a beer at a place which will take you 30 - 40 years back !

Ambience - 4.5

In today's "pub culture" of glitz and glamour and show offs, Hotel Broadway still carries out with its age old charm. The big fans hanging off the ceiling, the old tables and chairs, the staffs clad in uniform (of course not tees and jeans) bear the sign of colonial Kolkata, oops Calcutta !!! The place is always buzzing with the office goers thanks to its location being just a few minutes from Esplanade and Dalhousie, the vintage "office para". of Kolkata. And why not? Where can you get  60 ml Blender's Pride for Rs. 100 (that too, the price has been hiked quite recently, otherwise it was Rs. 90 just a few days back). Equally cheap are the other brands too. Haven't dared much to experiment with the food, usually try to stick to Chicken Pakora and Chilli Chicken, which are decent. If you prefer drinks over food, this is THE place. They don't provide any complementary food, which they did earlier (that was quite unique - fresh dices of cucumber.... gone are those days... getting nostalgic, sigh !!!). The service is also pretty good. 

I wish they start providing the complementary cucumbers once again....

If you wish to have cheap booze at a convenient location, this is the place to be. Dining area is big and price of booze is dead low, even lower than oly. Their dry chili fish, chicken jhal farezi, dry chili chicken are very good. Old colonial Calcutta like ambience, not a fancy pub.  Only drawback is no AC and no free snacks with booze.

I think it's the cheapest bar in the whole city of joy of it's kind.. ordered two beers, tuborg strong ( @ rs. 120) & carlsberg elephant strong ( @ rs. 150).. Unbelievable  naa...!!! But it's true.. the food menu was also very reasonable... ordered chicken masala ( @ rs.130 ) and chapaati ( @ rs. 9 each )... And the these were pretty good.. May be the reason behind this cheap menu is this is a non-ac bar ( I guess )...
Most importantly the crowd were good, You can easily identify the people come here holds good status.. Generally A cheap bar remains full with cheap crowd &  it makes the bar unique among all.. 
The ambiance was also very good, the sitting arrangement was quite impressive and the dim lights was making the environment more cozy...... Overall a nice experience and would love to visit the place again and again..

CONS : This is a non-ac bar, So you've to leave your luxury out of the door before entering. In the summer time it's really very difficult to booze up in a non-ac bar, the sealing fans are not enough..
                They do not provide ( or may be providing ) the free snacks with the drink.. :-(

So my friend and I decided to hop in to this place one random rainy afternoon. Ranting about how much we hate the world and bla bla bla 
So we spotting this place from right across chandni metro. It is one of the first pubs in kolkata, as soon as you walk in you will be blessed to see the whole vintage ambience around you. 
And also the place ain't that packed up. So it's a great deal if you have to rant n drink as the same time. 
So moving on .. We got the menu and then I fell of the chair and go admitted to the hospital :O ask me why ? 
Vodka 60 ml Smirnoff was only ₹55 I died .. 
No trust me I died ! We ordered vodka and beer to start of with 
Then we were hungry and we wanted food , I went through the menu it provided a fair choice of things .. I ordered chilly fish and chilly chicken 
So the chilly fish was intolerable I literally had a bite and kept telling my friend .. "What am I eating ? This is disgusting " 
And the chilly chicken was okayish. 
So In conclusion ! 
NEVER go and eat there ! Simply just drink. You go there and drink as much as you want to. But please for the love of god DO NOT eat the fish!!!!!

a great place to hang around with friends. once you go here you will feel you have arrived at coffee house and they have started selling liquor there! such is the ambiance. it's an old building and interior decor is quite ethnic which i liked. the stuff is helpful and mostly they are very old at this place serving customers. liquor price is cheap and food is good. fish finger, chilli chicken, chicken cutlet were good. they serves cucumber along with liquor which is actually quite a healthy practice :)

Okay, so first off - if you are a woman then you might want to bring a man or two in here in case you want to drink. I was refused service a few years back when I went here with three other women and ordered beer. After that, I did not risk the deal and always came here with at least a couple of men in tow. However, in the numerous occasions I have sat down here, I have not really seen women drink solo (ie without men). Also, there are a few things that totally makes up for this. First off, the price of booze. In this area where you would be ending up going to Chung Wah for bad food and heavily priced booze, this is a great and much cheaper alternative. Second, they make a very good chicken sandwich, which remains a favorite. Also, they make great fish finger, which is, in one word, YUM.

I went to this place when I working at the High Court. Its nearby just two blocks from Wellington Street. It is one of those watering holes, which still has the regulars coming.  remember a certain Punjabi Gentleman, who came, sat at his usual table (which he has been occupying for god knows how long), , the waiter brought the usual two pegs with a packet of Kaju. Filled both pegs to the brim. He finished both, one after the other, waived his hand across his exotic beard, in satisfaction, and left with his helmet. No nonsense. The crowd is composed of regular drinkers (note: No Drunkards). The washrooms are clean, the service is good. Try the Fish Finger. Its Fish and Chips. I mean it looks like a lot at fist. Then you discover that half of it is potatoes. On a tight budget. Recommended place. No air conditioning. Booze is very reasonably priced, and so is the food. I mean a 60ml Blenders for 80bucks. In Chandni. Right next to the Metro. What more can you ask for. Drink your fill, walk with the stuttered steps and board the Metro. And the leather back Chairs. They are pleasure to sit on !

I didn't try sitting "at the bar". I bet its Daily Passengers only. They keep the pollution out with two sets of doors ! The crowd is a healthy mix of regular office goers and kids like myself who cant afford any more. Beware - you might just find your Dad over here with some friends :p 

An establishment for the Bangali Bhodrolok, who want to have two pegs everyday after work (and who blamed them for that), wife would kill you if you did that at home, and yet you cant afford it at the the nearby Mathan (another good Bar, right next to the opening of Dacres Lane on Wellington Street), so there it is - old Broadway ! Must visit - to take in the smoky, alcohol filled aroma of the city.

To begin with I must admit that this is a perfect place for tipplers who harbor a soft corner for the golden old colonial ambiance .............. though the place is frequented by senior citizens, young fellows can also have a taste of Kolkata of the earlier times .................... Drinks apart, I loved their fish fingers, veg pakodas and the chicken fry ............. the classic ambiance makes up for the lack of AC ..............

simply  great  value for  money  for tipplers .  ambiance is  average  .  nothing  great  to write home about.  my first  5 stars on  zomato  .  100  pipers  here would  cost  you rs  150 /  60 ml  peg ,  probably the cheapest in  kolkata  .  great  old world 18th  century  charm  about  the place.  we had  4  100  pipers esch  i.e 8 100 pipers  plus  1  chilli chicken  ( boneless Rs  104  )  &  2 chicken  sandwich  (  rs  89  X  2  =  rs  178  )  ,  & yes  3  sodas  (  rs 16  X 3  = 48  )    +  1 peanuts ( rs  24 )   the total bill came at  rs  1200  +  178  + 104  +  48 + 24 =  1554 +  VAT  &  service  tax  =  rs  1602 which  was  a pleasant surprise  .  overall  a great find for tipplers .  just  one thing  to note , since  this place is  located  in  the busy  office area  , try  to go  there before  6  PM  .  or else  you  may  find  it  hard  to get  a  place . Best  of  luck  .  this place  for  STAGS  only ,  don't  take  any female relatives  with  you  .

Have you ever gone through your father's or grand father's university books? You'll have same feeling once you enter through their sleek door. You will get a real old Kolkata feel. Best place to spend your evening with friends, food & alcohol.
Cheap drink & food. Do try their Ala Kiev Chicken Cutlet or their Fried Chicken.

Old fashioned, beautiful and exceptionally good service. Food is exceptional, and still holds the olde world charm. It is one of the few places in Kolkata that holds a colonial glory and is quite cheap compared to other places nearby.here all sandwich items are superb,esply Sweet Corn sandwich is special item here.
