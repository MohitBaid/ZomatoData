This latest addition to the heart of the city is a haven for students who are always on a shoestring budget. I've taken parcels from here a few times. Haven't been let down even once. I love the chicken wings they prepare in BBQ sauce. 
I suggest fast food lovers to check this out.
The reason I gave a 4.5 instead of a 5 is because I'm waiting for a few seats inside this lovely place!

Nice little place. Good for take out, because sitting capacity is very little. Menu is also limited, but the food is really good. And the pricing is truly affordable.

Good food...  They serve fried chicken with their home made BBQ sauce... Which is awesome... The burgers are innovative and does not include the regular patty... A must visit for pocket friendly appetite
