It is located Just beside the Kamdhenu. This eatery mainly have Bengali and Chinese cuisine. I tried their Chinese.They have a take away counter and a restaurant. But the restaurant is non-a.c so it's better to go for the first option. This joint is very budget friendly. I like rolls,chana masala, tadka and mutton tikkia. Very fast service.Well qunatity and quality according to their price level.

Its at Baghajatin more. Aside auto stand connecting ranikuthi to baghajatin. Beside the kamdhenu sweet shop.
It's just an average restaurant. No such decoration. The food is mainly Bengali nd Chinese. Haven't tasted Bengali, but Chinese items were just average sort of, not that much tasty or anything unique. Feeds ur hunger well. Budget friendly prices.
