If you want booze which will go light for you pocket....this might be the one you are looking for..pretty easy to locate down as it is just beside the lane connecting em byepass with topsia.Local bus stop is china mandir.

Staffs are polite..but a bit slow as i think they are from the family who runs the business.As i said booze is cheaper,u can get a bottle and drink in your own rhythm..smoking allowed on the tables...Dont expect very delicious foods,they are very average..But   if you want to have ok ok food and booze together at pocket friendly price...you can go there..Atmosphere is favourable for ladies.

My favourite place in Tangra. Try the pan fried noodles mixed and try chilli chicken. Less crowded and good to take family along. Service is slow but the food makes up for it.

This is one of my favourite restaurants. I have  been its patron since last ten years and I don't regret being one. Sufficient parking place and smiling proprietors and staff, excellent food, dirt cheap price - it provides everything. We usually take peanut chat with drinks which the proprietress herself prepares it and it is delicious. Of the food, I love chilly chicken and hot garlic prawn the best. You can spend hours here, talking away to your friends, and nobody will disturb.

I am going to remain it's patron forever.

This restaurant provides many conveniences - ample car parking, in-your-seat smoking, a full bar and extremely pocket-friendly food. This is a killer combo for those looking to hang out with friends. Located behind Fung Fa (near Science City). The restaurant may not look much from outside, but the food is just as good as any other restaurant in the Tangra area. We arrived one morning before the opening time but the owner was kind enough to let us park our car and usher us in. Once seated, we ordered Beer (Tuborg, KF Strong), Chilly Chicken (Dry), Thai Fish and Drums of Heaven. 

Chilly chicken (Dry) was out of the world. Crispy and crunchy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside with the perfect amount of sauce and spice. Full plate quantity was good for 4 people - maybe 3 if you are big eaters. It probably is their best dish. The Thai fish wasn't too good - we've had better. The Drums of Heaven was more like Chicken Pakora - 7 pieces in a full dish but failed to impress. We also packed an order of Chilly Chicken and Chicken Fried rice and they turned out to be another great combo. 

All in all, we were sold on the convenience provided. A very affordable joint mostly for drinks/smoking with your colleagues/friends and cheap but good food!
