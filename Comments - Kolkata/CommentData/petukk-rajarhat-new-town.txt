Petukk is responsible for my love for Bengali food. I am a die hard fan of their chicken and mutton combos that are served with pulao/paratha. Every single non veg combo is just delicious. They have also added a Chinese section now a days. Though I haven't tried all the items from their Chinese section yet but the chili chicken is delicious. I have tried their schezwan paneer rice and I felt it was really spicy for my taste, however the chili chicken is a hit. My personal favourite is pulao with chicken rezala, one of the bengali items that very few places know how to prepare properly. Generally they serve rezala with paratha, once I asked them to send me pulao with rezala instead of paratha and they were kind enough to send me pulao even when only paratha was served with rezala. Overall, if you have a love for Bengali food, their chicken and mutton combos are hard to miss.

Cons- Very few as petukk has to be one of my favourites but they have increased their prices over time which I am okay with however, they have reduced the quantity of pulao. Only suggestion, if you are increasing prices then don't reduce the quantity of food.

Ordered for home delivery after reading the reviews.
I ordered murg methi malai and basanti pulao.
Delivery was on time. Good packaging. Taste was also nice
Basanti pulao was lil sweet, small grains of rice fried in ghee and lil cashew and raisin.
Murg Methi malai was very rich and the gravy was very thick, basically you can say no gravy but the taste was nice
The combo cannot suffice the hunger of two person, also single person with normal appetite couldn't finish it.

We ordered from here for a house party...n it was absolutely value for money with the quality n quantity of food they serve. The food was fingerlicious. For starter we ordered kaffir lime scented chicken fingers n smoked chicken, both were good but chicken fingers was amazing with a very distinct lime flavor. Main course we ordered kochi patha kosha , changezi chicken, murg methi malai with basanti pulao. Mutton were very soft n well prepared , there chicken preparations r really unique which we hardly find here. Overall had a very good experience. Looking forward to savour there other delicacies as well.

Delivery was within the stipulated time.  Quantity-wise it's a good value for money. But the food could have tasted better.

Totally disappointed today.. Ordered mutton & paratha combo from this joint on the basis of previous experience.. It was a horrible experience altogether. First of all they promised to provide laccha paratha but in the end what they provided was a "OILY MAIDA ROTI".. The mutton pieces were also not up to the mark not sure how come they term this mutton as "KOCHI PATHA"....Wont recommend this to anyone going forward..

Can't classify perfectly since I was served a delivery. Still I am trying based on it ;)

Pros:
Food recipe as recommended. It was not rich at all as I had wished.
Very reasonable rates.
Packaging appreciated. Delivery as well.

Cons:
Maybe, the Schewan Chicken gravy could have been a bit thicker. Else , it was alright.

It was definitely a good choice at 8:30 in the night.
You can definitely try it once, guys.

It was the first time that I ordered food from "Petukk". The food packaging was nice. The delivery service was really slow from Swiggy & Zomato, may be due to the Durga Puja.

My orders: -
Date: - 25/09/17
Murgh Methi Malai with Paratha (3 Pcs) Combo (Via Swiggy) ‚Äì The parathas were soft, less oily. The Murgh Methi Malai was too sweet and oily and didn't have much gravy to it. The 4 proper size chicken pieces were moist but slightly hard. [3/5]

Date: - 27/09/17
Awadhi Chicken with Basanti Pulao Combo (Via Zomato) ‚Äì The Pulao rice coated with yellow colour was dry, had neither raisins nor cashews. The sweetness was slightly on the higher side. The quantity was good enough for one person. The Awadhi Chicken was fresh; well- cooked and had good quality chicken pieces. It was oily and had little gravy. [3/5]

Overall Verdict- Good.

Zero rating, worst quality, extremely spicy food. I called the restaurant just after having second spoon. They don't read comments which you mentioned while ordering food. And at phone they said sorry. I told Rice was half cooked. Noodles were so sticky... And the person from restaurant said it was not, they serve like this. Next time I will never order from here and never recommend anyone to get food from this restaurant. WISH I COULD UPLOAD PIC FROM MY TRASH BOX...

Came to know about this online kitchen from a friend of mine in Bangalore.We ordered food from the "Petukk" for the first time in this Durga Puja and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well packaged although it was Puja time and rush hour for them. The delivery service was really quick. I loved their Kochi patha kosha with basmati rice. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly order from "Petukk" whenever we visit Kolkata.

I ordered chicken methi malai n parantha combo with an add on of basanti pulao, parantha was OK, chicken didn't have much gravy and basanti pulao was extremely sweet, which was making hard to eat it so had to throw it. I admit that basanti pulao are sweet generally but too much sweetness can also ruin a dish. Delivery person was very courteous which I really appreciate it. But you guys need to work on your food.

We ordered food from this joint during Durga Puja ,so I cannot comment on the ambience. Hence the rating is completely based on the quality and quantity of food.

We ordered a chicken combo with extra polao.

The quantity of food was great but quality could have been improved a lot . The chicken was average but the polao rice couldn't even meet the average level.

The first time I ordered from here was just to check whether they are really that good with all the hype and ratings. But they did justify with both the quality n quantity they serve. The Indian cuisine is really awesome with very different kind of flavor n taste which we hardly find in Kolkata. There Chinese is also good with different kind of sauce in which they toss the noodle n rice. Specially the hot n sour soya sauce which has a very distinct flavor. Keep up the good work Petukk.

Order type: Home delivery.
Item: 1 murgi methi malai and basanti pulao combo, 1 chicken Hakka noodles and schezwan chicken combo and 1chilli chicken.
Price: ‚Çπ642.40/-
Staff and service: We got delivery on time.
Description: We were searching for a good restaurant for our saturday dinner on zomato. Saw this restaurant on near by tab on zomato and due to it's high rating and good reviews we decided to order food from this joint. We ordered 1 dry chilli chicken for our starter, 1 methi malai chicken and basanti pulao combo and 1 schezwan chicken and chilli garlic chicken combo via zomato. After a few minutes of placing the order we got a call from the restaurant that due to some technical fault of zomato we had online ordering menu like that. But in real they do not provide any mix combo of veg noodles and chicken dish. So we changed our order from chilli garlic noodles to stir fried chicken Hakka noodles. The food arrived on time. But the food was not up to the mark of our expectations. My sister did a review about this on zomato. On the next day (today) the owner of the restaurant called my sister and asked about the faults in food. After that they delivered us 1 chicken chilli garlic noodles and 1 chilli chicken as complimentary. Their customer service program is good and efficient.
Food description:
1. Chilli chicken: (9/9/2017) We ordered for dry chilli chicken but by mistake they gave us chilli chicken in gravy.
2. Schezwan chicken: (9/9/2017) It was medium spicy. It had yellow bell peper in it.
3. Chicken Hakka noodles: (9/9/2017) Basic stir fried noodles with carrot, chicken and other few items in it.
4. Basonti polau: (9/9/2017) Plain small grain rice in yellow colour coated in ghee. Not much raisins and casew nuts we found in that polau.
5. Murgi methi malai: (9/9/2017) Chicken in a very thick gravy. It contained 1 leg piece and 3 big pieces of chicken. Taste of this was pretty good.
6. Chilli chicken (dry): (10/9/2017) Big pieces of boneless chicken topped with chopped garlic and chopped spring onions along with some sauces.
7. Chicken chilli garlic noodles: (10/9/2017) Noodles with chopped garlic and chopped green chillies fries with some sauces. It was definitely better than the chicken Hakka noodles.

After going through the reviews I Decided to give it a try. I ordered online through zomato, their murg methi malai and basanti pulao combo. The delivery was super fast. ¬†Now coming to the food The murgh methi malai was appetizing, really liked it. The sweetness in Basanti pulao was a bit extra though, the pocket pinch was 250 along with a extra pulao meal. ¬†Overall a good experience.

Type: Home delivery
Price: 643 INR Including tax

Description: got inspired by the rating and order a couple of items (basanti polao- methi murg combo , veg noodles combo and dry chilli chicken). And the decision was enough to ruin our saturday dinner. First of all I had ordered a noodles combo containing hot garlic sauce noodles and schezwan chicken. Within 5min i got a call from the joint that due to software fault of zomato, i was able to place the order. But it's not the correct combo. Hence I had to change it to chicken halka noodles and schezwan chicken. Deducting 0.5 for this. Then many other surprises were waiting for us after receiving the order. The packaging quality is ok, can't say good as methi chicken was coming out of the box. Started with the starter item. And then we got the second shock of the night. Dry chilli chicken had a thick layer of gravy and it was completely tasteless. Regarding main course - Road side joints serve better noodles than it. Chicken schezwan was average. Basanti pulao contained only raisins, found only 1 cashew nut in it. Methi chicken was better than others. Will never recommend this to anyone. Wasted my money successfully by wasting this food.

There north indian cuisine like murg methi malai, baked chicken masala, chicken makhanwala etc are sure to tantalize your taste buds. Recently they have started with there Chinese section , I have tasted a few of the item's on the list which are really good. Will surely indulge into the others soon.

Ordered couple of times and finally decided to write a review and give my rating. Food is indeed value for money. Very pocket friendly. Taste is also just like home made food. Delivery is also fast. Just one thing I didn't like is they give less gravy compared to the portion of rice/paratha, although they give good amount to of chicken/mutton pieces for each portion. Hence overall experience is good and gets a 4.5 rating .

Just had an office lunch from Petuk. We ordered it through ZOmato. First and foremost is their packaging. Just way too good. None of the product's oil came out from the packet which usually happen with Combo. We ordered combos like butter paneer + paratha, awadi chicken+ polao, butter chicken + paratha, murg methi + paratha.¬†We ordered it through ZOmato. First and foremost is their packaging.

Food: Pulao was quite good, sweet content was balanced, quantity wise very satisfactory; and Awadhi Chicken was perfect, chicken pieces were tender, soft, 4 perfect pieces, not so oily gravy was the thing I liked the most. 
Packaging: Microwave safe boxes, bag, tissue papers, fine! 
Salad: Complementary salad was the only thing I didn't liked, onion pieces were not good, so was the green chilli. 
Delivery: It was quick, considering the distance between the outlet and my place, I am more than satisfied, it took less than 40 min.

Conclusion: MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH PETUKK WAS VERY GOOD, THE DEAL WAS VALUE FOR MONEY, QUANTITY & QUALITY OF FOOD AND OVERALL SERVICES ARE NO DOUBT PERFECT! 

Keep it up Team Petukk...

Ordered Kochi Patha Kosha and basanti pulao using Swiggy ! The mutton did taste good, and the quantity was plenty! So no complains on either quantity or quality ! The basanti pulao was average , didn't taste good neither bad! But here issues with the quantity ! On an average decent pocket friendly meals !

It was our Friend's bday . She ordered from Petukk. Initially we were a little apprehensive as it is a new food joint.. However we were completely overwhelmed with the quality of the food. Quantity wise it is pretty much satisfying as well. The Kochi pathar jhol is a must-eat. The mutton was so soft and tender .The basanti pulao was equally good.  Missed out on the dessert though this time. Definitely looking forward to order again. So if you're based near it and have a party at office or at home, positively give it a try..

We had heard about this food joint a lot and finally got a chance to order food from here yesterday. The quantity is very very good and can easily suffice anyone. Out of all the food we had ordered I specially loved the basanti pulao and awadhi chicken. The chicken was very tender and literally melted in the mouth. The next thing that I liked was the packing. The food reached us dot on time as we had expected. +1 for the mouthwatering smell. Surely a recommendation for anyone who wants good food in a pocket friendly budget.

The place is very good for quick food. They served parathas or pulao with any one of veg, chicken or mutton dish. Enough quantity to make you please. Their service is very fast also. Quality is one of the things that should be higher. But none the less it is very good to have a quick petpujo. One of the major flaw in this point, i.e there is no place for sit and eat. You have to carry out your meal. But overall good place for eat but no hangout.

Ordered for the first time from Petukk last weekend. I must say the name is appealing and straightaway identifiable for food-lovers like me :) ..... I ordered 2 combos - fried rice with awadhi chicken ... and basanti polao with kochi pathar jhol ....

i must say the polao and kochi pathar jhol combo was great .... fried rice was good too but as personally i have a weakness for polao so i'm rating polao higher than the fried rice in satisfaction quotient :)¬† ..... For the chicken item, the chicken pieces were quite soft and succelent I must say ...¬† i liked the gravy of kochi pathar jhol more than that of awadhi chicken though ....

Prices acc to me are quite ok ..considering the fact that they are providing both the main course as well as a side item in a combo .... delivery time is quite less compared to what is infact mentioned in zomato .... and above all the politeness and behaviour of the people running the business are actually the iceing on the cake ....

Quantity is a tricky part here .... 1 combo might just suffice for an average person ...but for big foodies like me, one might not be enough :) ......

Overall i would certainly try out again from Petukk ..try some other dishes maybe ... my suggestion would be if they can upload the pics of the dishes they serve along with the names , then it would be helpful for us to understand while ordering (some pics are already uploaded mostly by users but without names though) ....

Petukk is really putting its mouth where the money is. Considering the quality and quantity of food and the excellent packaging, they are ridiculously cheap. I had the Awadhi Chicken and Basanti pulao combo. The quantity was sufficient for 2 people. At just Rs 200, that was a steal. The food was piping hot and smelled and tasted great.  Hope they keep up the quality.

Another online order, cause this time i was being bored at home alone. So the options seemed cool to me and the prices reasonable so thought of giving it a try. Now wish should not have done. I ordered a combo of basanti pulao and awadhi chicken. Wanted to order desert but options weren't available. Food arrived in good 40 minutes. Packaging was perfect. Chicken had good amounts and portions. Gravy tasted just ok. Chicken was well cooked. However I couldn't eat the rice. Might have had 2/3 spoons. It was just sweet no taste to it at all. I literally regretted ordering from this joint. Food was very bland. A strict no no for future.

Well, perhaps never in my life I have felt such a strong urge to write a review of a place. This review is not about how awesome food they serve (which they manage to do every single time) or how great the food is in quality or quantity. This is about the ridiculous and awestriking graciousness of the management.
Being a VERY frequent customer of them, I placed an order for a Awadhi Chicken combo after a long day at work. But when the food arrives, I couldn't find the delicious and aromatic yellow pulaao box in the package. Instead there were two boxes of chicken, neatly packed, with their monstrous quantity. A total win-win for me, yeah. But I promptly called them up and requested them to take it back while giving me my beloved pulao.
AND. OH. MY. They are ridiculously kind. The person came all the way back to my door just to deliver TWO boxes of pulao while completely refusing to take back the chicken! Who on earth does that? Ever?
What else can I say? Wish you a HUGE success, Petukk. And Thank you!

Ordered some food to my workplace in kestopur. The order reached me after an hour which was a total downer.
Being a vegetarian, I ordered paneer with pulao and dal makhani with fried rice. Both the variants of rice were good. I loved the saffron infused yellow pulao with a mild sweet flavour. I am quite a novice in bengali cuisine and the food, but the taste of this food wasn't typically north indian. It had a touch of bengaliana with mild spices and greater aroma.
The containers were sturdy, packaging was great.
The food was good but the delivery experience miffed me a little.

The first and foremost thing I would like to say is their delivery service is top notch.. My food was delivered within 15 minutes.. Damn good for a restaurant which only delivers..

I ordered basanti Pulao n kochi pathar Kosha.. 

Cost 250 and 20 Rs delivery charge.. 

The quantity is suitable for only one. 

So in quantity to price ratio, it is high priced.. 

The quality was however a good question to answer. 
The packaging was good and when I opened the packaging it was hot and the aroma was purely divine.

Is that enough to conclude it is good food? Probably not. 

I have tasted better basanti Pulao than this in kolkata and but the mutton was prepared nice. 

The cons in the chicken were
Pieces were very small. 
Only pieces with bones, I hardly found any meat. 
Moreover in 1 or 2 piece I found a stale smell. 

That is not good. 

I think I will give them another chance.

Ordered stir fried chicken with mixed sauce. The rice tasted awesome and essentially home-made. The chicken was very hard though,seemed like it had been cooked or heated multiple times. The gravy was very good,though very oily. Will definitely try again. If management is reading this, please take care of serving serving fresh/soft meat.

Recently was on a trip to kolkata, when my friend referred to Petukk. I was just blown away with the presentation and the ease of ordering and delivery. The food , beyond doubt was awesome. Almost 30 different dishes every week is a foodie's delight! I liked the Basanti pulao+ keema mutter. additionally I had ordered Kosha Mutton. Man! The dishes were awesome.. Full Paisa vasool. Keep it up Guys...
