It is hard to locate a pocket friendly eatery in park street area..but this one serves the purpose.I bumped into this place today.. N guess what its pretty cool.. Its quite small if u r with big group of friends but then seing the prices its manageable if u cn opt for takeaway.Food quality is fine n the staff are polite.

A small eatery serving variety of dishes like momos,noodles, pizza,etc. Definitely a pocket friendly eatery serving good food. Non-veg pizza had generous amounts of shredded chicken pieces and sausages and tasted delicious! Coffee rolls with vanilla ice-cream was good too. üòä

Foods are tasty and very much pocket friendly. I have ordered chicken Margharita pizza. It tastes good and was served nicely. Decoration is nice but the place is too small. Only 8-9 people can sit there.

Firstly it is located in Ripon Street in Park Street area. It is a bit small only for 6. 

The food is ,above average ,need to work on preparations. I tried crispy chilli baby corn and Pasta it was good but not great. Price is the best plus point of this fast food joint.

I would suggest to increase the size as well as improve the taste of foodüëçüèΩ

A small well decorated eatery which is very pocket friendly , serves good quality and quantity of food and that too quickly. If you're in a rush and want a quick bite this is a perfect place. I personally tried the noodles ,chilli chicken combo with coke and liked it. keep up the good work

Just loved it. Heard about it many times and finally arrived. Although it was not a planned visit honestly speaking not at all disappointed and this place can give competition to any big names present in Park Street in terms of the taste of food.

The main attraction is TASTE OF FOOD... Really nice and also very pocket friendly..
Although it's not spacious as only 4 people can sit there but very good for takeaway and if you are planning to go with 3-4 persons then it's right place.

We ordered Chicken Thai Soup, Wings on fire, chicken momo, Chicken gravy noodles and all were really tasty.

I have tried the chicken and pineapple pizza, the hawaiian salad, the double decker non-veg club sandwich, the hakka mein foon as well as the pan fried noodles, the crispy chilli baby corn, the oreo blast and the gondhoraj lime cool in a span of a week. All of them were the best I've ever had, no exaggeration. Thanks for making my short stay in kolkata worth it!

They opened this one recently . Maybe on 6th September of this year. Visited recently. Overwhelmed with their behaviour. And about the food; it was mind blowing. Both the owners were chef üë®‚Äçüç≥. That‚Äôs why dishes are very much innovative and mouth watering. Try their signature dish wings on fire. It‚Äôs one of the best . And definitely try the gondhoraaj lime cooler. One thing would like to mention; only 4 ppl can seat at one time. Parcel option is also available.

This is going to be my very first review on Zomato.And I am going to keep it long

Location - Near park street arsalan(Ripon st.)
Visited this place on Sunday evening.A small eatery with good music playing with a seating capacity of 5-6 people.

The food quality and quantity both are outstanding.
The hosts are very friendly are extremely courteous.

The things we ordered-

1. Cheesy pasta non-veg - The pasta was very delicious.The amount of cheese was perfect neither too less nor too much.

2. Chicken tikka pizza - One of the finest pizzas I had.All the ingredients were perfect.Very tasty indeed.

3. Wings on fire - This is the best of all.Saying anything about this dish is saying less.This one‚Äôs a must try for all.

We were immensely full as the quantity is highly satisfactory.And the price is also very moderate.Service was also quick
This place is a go go for all foodies who love food and also who wish to eat out their heart‚Äôs content.

To specify , couples who wish to go for small food  dates this is apt for them.
And for students too who like to Eat more Save more.

I have chanced upon this food joint while I was in Park Street for some work. Must say I am super impressed by their food offerings!

They are positioned to offer value for money, so all the lip smacking food comes at a pocket friendly price! 

The portions are enormous and one portion of most offerings can serve two people to the full. 

The menu isn‚Äôt exotic but each dish (that I have tried, must say I have tried many!) has a subtle twist that causes a blast on your taste buds! 

It is a small joint but is buzzing alive with pleasing music, and if you‚Äôre the only person sitting there, the owners (a lovely young couple) will come and have a nice chat with you! They enquire about your choice of food and make suggestions as to what you may like, and what comes out of the kitchen then, is ready to tease your olfactory senses crazy!! 

Few things that you HAVE to try : 
Wings on Fire (your life is a lie if you haven‚Äôt tried this!! Nothing like what you have tasted anywhere!!) 
BBQ chicken wrap (Completely tasty tummy filler)
Eaterniaa Special Burger (Sheer quality of this beats any burger you‚Äôve e er tried) 
Eaterniaa favourite sausages (who can ever go wrong with this one)
Chilli Chicken Roll (another lips smacking iteration)
Chicken Tikka Pizza (Dominos, come learn something!!) 

I personally think what made this quick snacking experience so amazing for me is the personal touch these guys provided while I was there, not only with the sinfully tasty food but also with the light hearted chats, their attentive hearing of my taste preference, and mostly for  starting a place that gives such a nice comfy vibe, a place where I recommend everyone one to go, laze around, chill and feel food fuzzy! 

Go now!!

Awesome food - excellent taste, presentation and portions too. We had their chicken wings, pizza and pasta... all of which were fantastic. The ambience is very cheerful and warm, as is the service. Owned, managed and run by a couple of great young chefs, Eaterniaa is the perfect blend of great food, atmosphere and personalised service. And if you don't want to wait when the restaurant is full, just order a takeaway / delivery.
