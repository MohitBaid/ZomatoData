This is a restaurant I stumbled across in sheer hunger and was pleasantly surprised by the food. A small food joint near Girish Park metro which impressed me with what I opted to have, namely the chillin garlic pepper chicken, the chicken hakka chowmein and the schezwan chicken. The flavours were pretty decent with ample proportions.

I have been a resident of Girish Park all my life but still missed this place till now. But it is a place that scores high on reliability & delivering decent food at a decent price. The place is located within a 3 to 4 minutes walk from the Girish Park crossing and falls on your left if you head towards Kankurgachi.

I had ordered a Mixed Hakka Chow & a Shredded Chicken in Chilli Garlic Sauce. The chowmien was loaded with chicken, egg & prawn & tasted very good. If you are hungry much, this will make very happy. The chicken dish did not taste that good but the quantity was very generous. It was also from the special menu. My belief is that had I ordered a side dish from their regular menu, it would have been much better as the cooks are more familiar with it. The service was nice.

Chhota Ellaichi is one of those little places that might not be outright special but will save your hungry soul in times of need. Will definitely return here.

Food was good.  Didnt try much of these, though Pan fried momo was yum. They suffice you in Quantity. Slightly overpriced. Took 175 plus gst for Pan fried chicken momo. I even tried Mojito from threir Limited list. Not upto the expectations. Staff was courteous but shortage of much space held them on top of us.  Overall an average score to serve you. Hope this helps. :)) Cheers!

Famous for their Chinese food items especially the gravy chow and mughlai kebabs and tandoori ..you will be attracted each time if you visit it once ...but the worst part is the dining table ..where they serve you with their greetings and food ...tiny and congested ...but you can face the required quality food when hou visit it ..

The staff have no manners to behave, today while India Sri Lanka match which was going on TV in Mute we just played a video on Facebook for which their staff came and asked to turn off the volume and for a small video of hardly 2 minutes they turn on the volume. It's such a unprofessionalism that should not me maintained in a place where we go for value services.

Very underrated place with nothing but great food. The only non veg serving place in Girish Park. Must try Yakhni Pulao whose rice is cooked with mutton stock. Sounds gross but taste is another level. Kebabs are amazing too. You don't have another choice to go in Girish Park.

Its a small restaurant near the Girish Park-vivekananda rd Xing. I wish they had more space. We ordered chicken kalimirch kabab and their specialty Yakhni Pulao. Its mutton pulao really, with nicely cooked mutton cubes. I kinda liked the dish...reminded me of something similar made by mom. The kalimirch kebab was ordinary and the sweet lime soda was a disappointment. Visit to taste the pulao. Its good.

This is one of the latest eateries on the block, located on Vivekananda Road close to the Girish Park Metro Station. The seating arrangement is small and cozy and the service is quite good. They serve both Indian and Chinese food, but this time we went for the Indian fares. We tried the fish finger as a starter. Six pieces of solid fish cooked in the usual coating and served with both mustard as well as tartar sauce and french fries on the side. It was slightly hot mainly due to the green chillies in the batter, but still bearable. In the main course we ordered one peas polao and one yakhni polao. These two rice dishes were more than enough for the six of us. The peas polao, with its gentle fragrance of ghee was amazing. But the yakhni polao stole the show for us non veg lovers. It consisted of rice cooked in mutton stock and served with boneless mutton cubes. Tastes a lot like mutton biryani but without the rose water smell that many people detest. It was absolutely out of this world. We had the chicken reshmi butter masala with the rice and thay too was delicious with its thick rich gravy and solid chicken pieces. The prices were extremely pocket friendly and the meal filled both tummy and soul.
Special mention: These guys keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in the tables which is a thoughtful gesture as it is often difficult to get up and go to the wash basin in the cramped space, especially if you are a large party.

Located near Girish Park Metro, this small restaurant offered us food and refuge during our pandal hopping spree. Even with all the rush, the food was superb. We ordered Mixed Noodles, Chicken Hot Garlic, Schezwan Paneer for main course. All of them were good, and quantity ok. But the showstealer was the Nawabi Kebab which was their speciality with tender chicken pieces and cheese toppings. We ordered mayo to go with the kebab on a frnd's suggestion and even the mayo had a unique taste to it. Must try their Spaghetti and the Nawabi Kebab

The USP of this restaurant has to be its moderate pricing of items. Considering the pricing I definitely liked tasting the food they served. Some of their dishes are just awesome like chicken chaap, kebabs and on the veg front paneer delicacies. But it falls short on a number of other aspects. First the dim and dull interiors dont appeal much to you. But then you realise that most of their food are either parcelled or packed away. So its a nice place to order some selective items from if you are having a party but definitely a big no if you want to go for a nice dinner outside.

This place is located inside a narrow lane on Vivekananda Riad, and is a popular joint for takeaways in the neighbourhood . The place has a separate takeaway counter , where you can view the kitchen , and the cooking right in front of your eyes. The restaurant is adjacent to the takeaway counter , and is air conditioned . The chicken gravy chow we ordered home was served in    two separate bowls , one containing the noodles , and the other had the thick gravy to be served on top . The gravy noodles tasted good .The Schezuan Chicken tasted average , and the chilli fish had a slightly pungent smell of fish which perhaps could have been avoided . Overall the food was good and is a good option for those  Chinese cravings !!

Ive been going to Chhota Elaichi for the past one year now, its an great outlet for chinese and Indian fooding. Ive eaten at the restaurant, Ive eaten rolls outside the place almost daily for 3 months and Ive also ordered for Home Delivery many times when my friends or relatives have come around.

Recently, I ordered for Home Delivery which was Veg Pulao, Paneer Tikka, Aloo Dum and Chilli Baby corn and I loved every single bite of that food though for the first time I didnt like the Panner Tikka as it was just 4 slices of panner and very little fruits. It was nothing as shown online or on the menu. The food was great, I loved the babycorn and so whoever orders for food from Chhota Elaichi we order it and trust me we order every week atleast once.Â 

I trusted Chhota Elaichi this time like always as my friends were staying home and none of them appreciated the 4 sq slices of panner for 100rupees and it just didnt feel worth it!

Located  in between  Girish Park metro station and Vivekananda road. Since it is located near of my house, I have had taken home delivery for multiple times. They didn't charge you huge but the food is really tasty. Moreover, they didn't charge any tax. 

Dishes must try-- Reshmi kabab,hariyali  kabab, tandoori, Hakka noodles, chicken side dishes & in Chinese starters crispy chicken, chicken lollipop & chicken wings. 

I never had my food by seating in the restaurant, so I can't comment on service or ambience. Though the place is very small. 

All of the above dishes prices  are so reasonable & quality & quantity are so good that you will come for second time for sure if you are living in neighbourhood.

Ambience and Staff: It is a relatively small joint with 16 seating capacity. But the ambiance is Cozy and the staffs are really attentive & courteous.

Food: The Foods are just Awesome & quantity is also good. I would suggest some signature dish of the joint which are really delicious eg. Stuff Tengri Kabab, Mutton Shikari Kabab, Crunchy Chicken, Achrya Gosht, Fried Fish with Tarter sauce to name a few.

Its really tough to write because while writing i started salivating.. Feeling HUNGRY...!!!!!

Location and Description: "Chota Ellaichi" the name has no link to the Ellaichi, the place actually a restaurant. The Restaurant is somewhere in a hidden location but can be seen easily, i could say my Adda point for few years. Just near the Girish Park crossing left to Vivekanand way 1st left turn. A match winner resto at that place with no competition.

Ambience and Staff: This place is not that big but yes it is good place for a small restaurants with few colorful table and chairs with full A.c. It was empty in the afternoon so the staff attended us quickly and was polite.

Food: The Biriyani here is very delicious with One Chicken and a big potato and a piece of egg as usual, thou a bit short in quantity but the flavors were really well cooked. The Chicken piece was average. The biriyani at the end dosen't left me disappointed. They also provide with other Chinese Cuisines with some good options.

QNQ & Prices: This place needs to improve a bit in quality and quantity. Prices are not too high may fit according to your budget.

Conclusion: The kitchen should be improved. They also provide Rolls etc can be taken from the outside just near the gate. The place is very good to have a resto but they are unable to capitalize with it.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Talking about chhota elaichi, only 3 things come to my mind; the bad interiors, uninterested staff with the poor service & BAD FOOD. Sampled the Paneer Butter Masala with Laccha Paratha & I must say, I've never had any worse than this! The portions are small too. All in all, just give this place a skip.

Interior : Poor
Food quality : Poor
Service : ok 
Not at all satisfied! For rolls this is good, but for chinese food, I must say it's not worthy to spend money here.

There ia no doubt about the quality of food. But the joint is really small and the staffs are not groomed properly. Tried almost all the items here. Best is the momo and rolls of all variety. I have sat and had ordered for home delivery as well. The minimum amount for home delivery is 300 even if its next door. Well, its not a very good restaurant to ask so much.

A proper non vegetarian restro in girish park is what is solely unexpected. It is just near the girish park crossing towards vivekananda road. there is a parcel corner where rolls are served. And the mutton roll that they make is amazing. Coming to the restro, it is an exceptionally good restaurant but the space is limited. 16 seater. It tends to be less crowded, so getting a place is not always a prolem. It is the nearest place to my locality where you get amazing spaghetti bolognese. So all my regards to them for making this possible. The other recommended item on their menu is the amazing panfried crispy chicken. It is cripsy , tasty and is made with an amazing sauce. Then of course there is the amazing hakka noodles and chilli chicken dry which is too cliched and amazingly prepared by them. Another dish is the chicken in plum sauce. A must try. I do not know about how well they prepare their mughlai dishes as I always find it easier to relate myself to chinese food. I am surely visiting this again and again.

Visited last week . A sudden crave in stomach drew me to chhota ellaichi as I was loittering in and around girish park. thought of reviving the old charm of my all time favourite chicken in plum sauce when I suddenly noticed they have a special summer menu. I could not resist myself when I saw the list. It read aam porar shorbot on the top. I immediately ordered for it. I was super elated to see fish in the menu. I thought to myself. Finally north kolkata's palate is changing. Without a shadow of doubt it had to be panfried stuffed bhetki. It took quite some time for them to serve. My hunger was just about to die when my aam porar shorbot arrived. The aam porar shorbot was done real well. Every thing was amazing, the only complain being instead of sugar syrup they used sugar cubes and I had to literally nibble off the sugar cubes. The fish arrived soon. Looked amazing and when I had my first bite I was taken aback. It was pomfret and it did not smell. The more I dug into it the more cheese trippled off and stuffed mushrooms jutted out and together with the pomfret , it was heavenly. And the best part they do not charge the service tax. So eat and enjoy is the moral of the story. am definitely recommending this summer special menu to try out their summer special menu . I bet you will not be disappointed. @

Very small food joint, preferable for take away. If you live nearby, can go for home delivery.
Really recommend the Chicken Steamed Momo, its yummy!! Have also tried their spaghetti, garlic fish and some chicken starters. Those were pretty great too. Although, the hakka noodles could have been better. Once, the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was quite tasty, but extremely oily.
Overall, quality is good and worth the price. The food experience is always quite satisfactory here.

Excellent food and very good client treatment. Hariali Kebab, Reshmi Kebab, Tikka Kebab are among their masterpieces. Place may be small but still different from the average. They even arrange candle light dinner on special occasions. Recently tried Chicken Sikh Kebab Mashala, I'm sure one shouldn't miss it for anything. Marvelous preparation. Thanks to them

No problem to find the place thanks to google maps. But the place was very small. In fact there was to basin for hand wash. The worst thing is they shows the old black n white song on the TV. But the food was good though. The polao cooked in mutton stock was good n also the chicken bharta.

I had ordered a pan-fried momo, bt d taste was OK bt was not appropriate and authentic Chinese flavour. When u pay 130rs for a plate of momo, u atleast expect the condiments to b good enough, the chili sauce tasted like one which the road side chowmein walas serve. 
Quantity was good.

Since i studied in Nopany, Girish park was my adda. All of my friends have visited here with me and since there is a stand for rolls outside the restaurant, we always had a roll whenever we craved for it. Its a small restaurant, reasonably priced and food is good for that price. I always order chilli crispy babycorn.
