The restaurant was not known to any of us..we discovered this restaurant when we did not find a place at Noir.The restaurant need to be more active when they make so yummy food.The best part is that they take very personalised care and keeps on asking of how we are enjoying..
Wish my friends could accompany me.However they don't have liquor service..but they have good options in mocktails..wish them luck and people should respect their attempts..

The ambience and menu isn't very inspiring but I was left pleasantly surprised by the food. The corn and broccoli fritters arrived looking depressed but tasted quite alright, though oily. The tomato basil pasta arrived looking fantastic and tasted just so. A very satisfying pasta and hence, a satisfying meal overall.

It was overall a decent experience for me as the place was amazing but there were no one there other than me and my friends and the restaurant staffs. Located at the 3rd floor of Golden Tulip Hotel, Salt lake, the food was okish and hospitality was fine.¬†

PS- Not really a worthy recommendation!

Well ,this was a random discovery during Puja days.I was looking for a place that serves pasta at 3 in the morning near sector 5 post pub hopping.The rating is based completely on their food and the service.This place is a part of Hotel Golden Tulip near City centre 1.The restaurant is on the first floor and has extrely nice decor ,very subtle and tidy.We seated ourselves on the couch and ordered for a Chicken mushroom pasta with no veggies except mushroom and a coffee for my friend.The server was extremely warm nice gentleman who said the pasta might take a while as they will prepare it fresh.About 20minutes later the  white creamy bowl of goodness arrived in front of me.As I took a spoonful ,i tasted everything to perfection.Chunks of chicken and loads of mushroom with a white creamy sauce.The coffee was complementary and they even offered my friend a second serving of coffee.Such impressive service is so rare nowadays.

Food was very good except the desserts.The cakes were pathetic.Please look into the dessert section as starters n dessert r the two things which everyone look forward to.The starter counters were empty as they were serving the freshly prepared ones.Though the motive was good but they were too slow to satisfy the customers.Overall its a good place with warm reception from the staff.

Anti-Pasti is the 24√ó7 multicuisine restaurant of the 4-star hotel Golden Tulip located at Salt Lake, not far from City Centre 1, and close to the other 4-star property De Sovrani.
Ambiance is calm and relaxing, while the decor exudes an air of elegance and sophistication, decked with flower vases, comfy sofas, purple cushions, chandeliers and a huge glass window with a gorgeous view.
We visited it for breakfast on the morning of Chaturthi. We opted for Chole Bhature, and Cheese Dosa with a cup of deliciously made Cappuccino under the South Indian Traditional fare. One can also choose between the variety of dosas in the menu like rava dosa or onion dosa, or even go for idli or uttapam.
The white chutney accompanying my choice of crispy dosa stuffed with soft cheese was absolutely lip-smacking; had some really good South Indian chutney after quite a long time. One doesn't really get an authentic Southern taste everywhere, and being very critical about food I was totally wowed by its taste and freshness, not to mention the samber and the other orange chutney. The chole bhature too was appetising, while the perfectly hot coffee was absolutely pleasing to the taste buds and senses.
Anyone looking for good food should definitely check out Anti-Pasti. Totally recommended. üëç

Anti Pasti is a multi-cuisine 24*7 restaurant of the Hotel Golden Tulip. This is their best restaurant among the other 4 restaurants. A wonderfully decorated place with a traditional touch and enough seating arrangements for about 30-40 people. Big glass areas and awesome ambiance make this place a must go for each and everyone.Anti Pasti at The Golden Tulip is celebrating this Durga Puja with the People of Kolkata by launching its Puja Special Buffet menu named as ‚ÄúBangalir Bhuribhoj‚Äù . The menu will be ever ending and with many forgotten delicacies of East and West Bengal. The puja Special Buffet will be available from 26th Sep (Sasthi) till 30th Sep (Dashami)¬† and the timing will be 12pm-3:30pm (lunch) and 7:30pm-11pm (Dinner) and Price will be 899/- per head. You will also get other multi-cuisine delicacies throughout the day. Me along with the members of #TeamPanchPhoron was invited by the Golden Tulip for this event. The buffet spread was huge and they have different menus for each day.

The best preparation was the fish starter, it was hot and soft, very pleasing to the tongue. The desserts were very good. The waiters were very polite and helpful. Moreover, the ambience of the restaurant was very pleasing. A good place to dine out, withyour friends, family and if course the special one.

Now comes to food part.Very honestly say the sizzler is awesome."Monsoon kebeb on sizzler"festival is going on over there.I have ordered for a chelo kebab and zaitoni paneer tikka.The quality was very good.

Mocktail was outstanding.They served me hawaiian kiwi blizz. Presentation was really good.

Restaurant decor was very good.Due to the friendship day special baloons decoration was mindblowing.

We went on 6th August 2017 (friendship day) for lunch. The place was almost vacant to our surprise. Then we were told that the place is booked entirely for dinner. Anyway the staff who greeted us to the staff who served us were all really courteous and eager to make our dining experience comfortable.
We ordered:
Virgin Mojito
Chicken manchow soup
Chicken sweet corn soup
Paneer tikka
Murg lasooni kebab
Mushroom dumplings
Crispy fried fish
Chicken kaali mirch
Cheese garlic naan
Hot gulab jamun
Coconut ice cream
Tutty fruity ice cream

All the items were lip smacking and very fresh. Special mention to their murg lasooni kebab and cheese garlic naan. The virgin mojito too was the best I ever had.
Will definitely visit again because they have a food festival going on- "kebab on sizzler special".

No wonder that Golden Tulip is a 4 star property ; from the jacuzzi and hookah parlor on the top floor to housing ¬†one of the restaurants with finest ambience on the third floor, everything portrays sophistication and elegance. Anti Pasti being a fine dining restaurant has surely carved out a niche for itself in the hearts of the people owing to its royal decor, exemplary hospitality and ¬†finger-licking food. ¬†Kebabs and sizzlers both are enough to make a person go weak at the knees, well guess what Antipasti brings a combination of both in a monsoon special menu to satiate your hunger. Kebabs from the grill are presented on a sizzler so you get to inhale the smoky while gorging on the kebabs. They do have a number of kebabs on the platter, pairing a mocktail with which can turn it into a heavenly experience altogether.Team Panchphoron was invited for the launch of newly incorporated items. Read on to find out the details

this review is not anticipated at all, rather I'll say go and grab the monsoon special Sizzler Menu.

get the address from here and experience this monsoon with all new kebabs platters in form of sizzler.

Me along with my foodie friends visited this place to taste this kebabs on sizzlers platters.
                    

We were offered to taste 6 types of sizzler platters along with mocktails. Each and every dish was a rockstar.
                    

My favorite was chello...Though that was fully my personal choice. I'll suggest you please go and grab the platters. But order different dish so that you can taste each dish a bit.

And if you want to experience Jacuzzi and hookah you can visit the top floor too.

Great ambience!
The guy playing the guitar was awesome. The live music, very polite service and ofcourse the lights üòç
The food was average. The mocktails weren't good enough. The starters stole the show. But the most disappointing was the main course. The chicken side dish was good but the shock was the quantity of rice. It came in a really small bowl üòõ trust me when I really small. 
But this was compensated by the really warm service provided my the waiters and managers.

You might have noticed Sonnet and De Sovrani near city center.. However it's at the same location behind Tantuja bhawan on the 4th floor of Hotel Golden Tulip. They do have a mouth watering ala carte menu.. however we opted for the buffet during our visit. Veg and non veg starters were served at our table along with the welcome drink.. chicken starter and corn fritters were well tossed in sauce with paneer and fish as well. All were well cooked and leaves a flavour on your tastebuds. Chicken and corn soup and tomato soups were very simple yet tasty. Fish being a little behind in comparison with the rest. Mocktails were in variety with watermelon, orange and fanta. Main course variation and dessert types were quite less, as informed they are on set menu requested by the guests. Main course spread has pea pulao, daal tadka, parathas, paneer, corn mushroom curry alongwith non veg sides of chicken and fish too. Quality and standard were at par for all of them. Desserts were limited with only gulab jamun and malpua.. gulab jamun were very tender soft and delicate.. however malpua tasted a little sour. Vanilla ice cream with age old authentic combination of chocolate sauce. Staffs were very good. They served each of their guests with equal importance and requested feedback after each serving. Took care of the toddler with an arrangement of high chair. There was a casual live music.. a guy was singing with a guiter on the tunes of all romantic and sufi melodies along with few bengali and english tracks as well. Only single unisex washroom, needs a bit more cleaniness and the main door repairment. Sitting arrangement is with adequate leg space, not more than that. Overall, a suggested visit for a good experience with a warm welcome and must try ala carte items on the menu card.

To Anti pasti..Need to go ahead a few little steps to cover up the drawbacks.. and stay high in competition. Rated 1 point extra only for good service. Sarathi Sanyal

Located in The Golden Tulip Hotel in Salt Lake Sector 1 , I had been to this restaurant for work and as it was an early morning meeting, I decided to meet my client over breakfast. 

They have an all inclusive breakfast menu for 500 bucks. Can you believe it?? With a great spread of food and made to order dishes like Dosa, variety of Eggs and Sausages along with the usual breakfast spread , it is a steal any given day. 

I love the ambience of the restaurant , the decor is very airy and comfortable and it has very good staff who are extremely polite and courteous. 

The fact it is a 24√ó7 place makes it a must go to during all night outs and early morning breakfast Cravings. Loved the place will surely be there ASAP.

Keep up the good work.

Place               : Anti Pasti

Location            : Golden Tulip Hotel, Saltlake

Cuisine             : Chinese, North Indian, Continental

Anti Pasti  is located at the third floor of the Golden Tulip Hotel  is known for its simple, healthy and delicious all-day food menu. 

Firstly, the ambiance is absolutely beautiful. The seating arrangement is such that it ensures privacy, 
 as compared to many other restaurants with a similar concept. The buffet indoors is laid out beautifully, 
 like how you‚Äôd see at a restaurant in a 5-star hotel. The service is remarkable. The staff is extremely courteous and well mannered. ¬† They know the dishes being served quite well. They‚Äôre always on their toes to make sure that guests are served with food constantly and adequately. ¬† Even the chefs behind the buffet counter are always alert so as to cater to the needs of the guests. ¬†The food is of course more delightful and delectable than anything else. Their new set sizzlers menu is amazing. I had the following dishes: ¬†

Vegetarian sizzlers :

1. Galouti kebab

2. Chello kebab

3. Subz Seekh kebab

4. Rosemary Baked paneer tikka

5. Zaitooni Paneer tikka

6. Imliwale Bharwan aloo

Non-vegetarian:

1. Chello Kebab with Mutton seekh kebab and chicken pahari kebab

2. Murgh Chapli Kebab

3. Murgh Methi kebab

4. Amritsar Mahi tikka

5. Joshila Tangri Kebab

6. Tandoori Jalpori

This is definitely one of the best places in Saltlake Sector 1 with the lovely terrace.

Excellent food and prompt service makes this a good choice to spend time with the friends and family on the sunny afternoons.  All in all, I had a fantabulous experience and I‚Äôd even say you‚Äôre really missing something if you haven‚Äôt visited Anti Pasti , Golden Tulip Hotel . I thoroughly enjoyed my meal in the lovely ambiance and feel provided by this place . Their innovative food and drinks makes it a unique place in its own.  Recommended to all fellow foodies.  Many Many thanks to Rajdeep Bhattacharya, the management , and the owner for inviting us .

Located near City Centre. Went there on the 1st of January, so happy to see a place with very soft music and less rush. Extremely hospitable staff, super yummy food.Tandoori Aloo- a must tryOrdered a Paneer Tikka- without Onion Garlic that was served with onion garnishing by mistake. It was compensated and served fresh on the house.Prices are affordable and not too pricey. Each and every dish served on the table was delectable.¬†We were 6 people and it only costed us 2k.

This restaurant is located in the 4 star hotel The Golden Tulip just behind sonnet near cc1. 
The ambience out here  is beautiful. It looks grand....with touch of orchids....high ceiling... beautiful chandeliers .....big frames. 

The food here is average. 
# lemon coriander chicken soup- very oily, lacked flavour
#fish fingers- just about ok
#chicken pahari kebab- coating wss good but chicken was very hard and not marinated well
# chicken risotto- okayish

The food being average....they gain their points on the staff. Captain bulti was very good. She took
Special  care and made us meet the chef for the kebab being hard. The chef made a special mustard kebab for us on his own which was a great gesture. 
Even captain Avik took good care. We were also given complimentary fresh lime which was a great gesture but again it was fiven to us with the soup which is a hot item. Could have been given later. 

Overall good place....very courteous staff...need little extra training. But great experience.

The restaurant will not be serving a-la-carte during the Puja days.

 During Durga Puja the management has also organized special sarodiya d√©cor, some surprising activities like dandiya, live Bengali music. Isn't it a great-to-go thing?

I am sure it is. Moreover, the Anti pasti is 24x7 Multicuisine restaurant. However, for the Puja days (Shashti to Nabami) the buffet will be available at 12:30 pm to 4 pm (lunch) and 7:30 pm to 1 am (dinner). I think that's quite a big time window. People can enjoy the lavish lunch or dinner after lots of pandal hopping and hanging out with friends and family.

Enjoy people! Love and hugs

Went to dis place 2day in d aftrnun!                                  Location: Near to CC1! Comin to d restaurant it is a 4 star property which has recently been constructed.It is on the third floor of the hotel named Golden Tulip.           Ambiance: As one can expect in a 4 star,high ceilings with beautiful lights,for the Durga puja festival  beautiful decorations have been made.                                                         Food: First we were offered wid d appetiser i.e roasted papad with 2 welcome drinks which were awesome, thereby we were served with chicken manchow soup which was good,now coming  to the starter it was dry Schezwan chicken which was again very tasty,then we were served with chicken in BBQ sauce served with a chutney which was excellent.i would suggest that one should definitely  try it at least ones,moving to the staples it was Burnt ginger fried rice which was good but could have been better & Chili garlic noodles which was good but was little oily!Next 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream was served.Lastly d restaurant Manager who alone takes +1 of d rating on account of his politeness,was one of d very nice person I met till date.He gave a tutti fruity 4 rm his side!

Visited the restaurant yesterday with family. Comparatively a new place with nice interiors. This was the first visit to the place so I was a bit tentative as to what to expect. But as we entered we were quite impressed with the service n courteousness of staff led by the manager himself. Coming to food, We ordered chicken sweet corn soup which was good. Then we went for a few starters like tandoori aloo, schezwan chicken, grilled paneer n fish fry, all of which were well cooked n yummy. The mocktails served by the restaurant complemented well with the starters.  Coming to the main course, as usual not much of appetite was left. We still ordered a bowl of steamed rice, yellow dal, butter chicken n sorshe fish and a mix veg curry. The fish n chicken preparations were again very good. Didn't like the mix veg much though. could the meal end without some nice deserts. Noooo wayyyy. The manager suggested that we go for the tuti fruity n choco brownie with ice cream.    Trust me if the ratings are high, then the deserts were the clincher. Overall a very nice experience. Shall definitely look forward to visiting the place again.

Went of Buffet which available only for Saturday and Sunday. Expectations were high but the food was not at all warm which depressed us at first place
Now if we talk about starters they served Chicken Nuggets and something of fish..fish was like kept since morning and nuggets after ordering 2 plates then fresh stock came which was good.
Main Course - only lasagne was good
Desert - Too monotonous Gulam Jamun and ice cream there is nothing special in this.
I strongly recommend not to visit this for Buffet.
Can't comment about Ala carte

This restaurant has an amazing decor and ambience. I must say that the staff is very courteous. Always ready to help. The service is good. The food was good too. I really liked the cheese naan. Black dal, american corn pepper salt, stuffed tandoori aloo is a must try. Tomato basil soup was not that warm but the taste was good. Also, the food quantity is good. All in all I had a good experience. :)

This is a multicusine restaurant of the Tulip Hotel. To start off nice ambience. Huge ceilings, well lit up and nice d√©cor. Coming to the food, we had the manchow soup, tomato basil soup, minestrone soup and the asparagus soup. Soups were good, but the asparagus could have been better. The American salt and pepper and the bharwan aaloo were yum. For main course we had an assortment of breads. A point of complaint is with the lasagna which had The taste of elaichi. The standout ones were the masala kulcha and the jeera Parantha. In the vegetables section loved the paneer labrador but the subz handi could have been better.
They gave us tuity fruity as a complimentary dessert.
All in all, it was a good place.

In an effort to do much better for the restaurant, this morning's breakfast in kolkata has been self explanatory with the spread's lay. Keep it up guys, and honestly you need to pull up your socks on paranthas. 

All in all, great experience.

This is one of the few places that one can find with a combination of Great Ambiance, Outstanding dishes and a welcoming staff. Also not to forget the dedicated Restaurant Manager Mr. Sanjoy Kumar who will always be welcoming no matter what time it may be. The breakfast buffet is one of its kind with every kind of dish one would imagine including a variety of drinks and a wide variety of curds - something i never expected. The staff tries its best to carter to our every need.¬†

Ambiance:¬†
The restaurant is spacious and has a very nice outside view. The interiors are very well done and taken care of. The place also has a very nice aroma to it.

Food:
I went for lunch and had a few starters recommended by our very own Mr. Sanjoy. Both the veg and non-veg starters were exceptional and the cranberry cooler being the cherry on top of them.
For the next day morning breakfast buffet i ate a lot :P because of the exceptional variety. These included Vada chutney, Toast Omelette, Chicken Kentucky, Veg Cutlet, Poori Dum Aloo, French Toast. If my stomach was not full i might have just continued. There was more than 40 different varieties of foods and drinks all of them looking very good.¬†

Staff:
The best people are working here. Everytime u cross them they will greet you no matter how many time they might have already done it. Their pleasant 'Namaste' is very welcoming. Hats off to the people and the manager.

The last thing i would like to say is that the restaurant manager has a very good taste in food and recommends excellent stuff. Better not to miss the opportunity and regret later so be sure to ask him for great recommendations.

Had an opportunity to visit the 24/7 multi cuisine restaurant at Hotel Golden Tulip for the first time. Located at a stones throw from City center 1 this place should be able to capture a good crowd in the coming days. With an array of multi cultural dishes and various innovative mock tails the restaurant is a good option to try out for a family or corporate lunch and dinner.
We were offered quite a few types of mock tails of which Fruit de la passion was the best.
As the name says... This drink is a concoction of passion fruit with a strawberry Base. The aroma of the drink is very refreshing and is a must try item. I quite liked the concept of the mock tail Black Sea. It is prepared keeping diabetic patients in mind. The blueberry flavour along with the fizz gives this drink a quirky taste.
Among the starters the ones worth mentioning are chicken grilled sandwich, mutton chelo kabab, pomfret in schezuan sauce, prawn in hot garlic sauce. All of these items have a uniqueness of their own. The presentation of the items were equally good. I think a little effort should be put on the quality of the fish. The fish taptan can be enhanced in both its taste and quality. Grilled tiger prawns were the yummiest among the starters. The succulent prawns will just melt in your mouth.

The veg kolhapuri was nice and according to me it will go well with a roti or naan. The murga butter masala was at par with any other restaurant serving the same item. The navratan pulao was something new and innovative. It was more like the Persi biryani with lots of fruits and dry fruits. It can be eaten without any side dish also. The sweetness of the pomegranate, Apple and pear along with the crunchiness of the cashews are a treat. The mutton adraki was the undefeated winner among all the items served.

Lastly we were served the sizzling Brownie in chocolate sauce. It came in quite a good quantity and the dessert kind of refreshed our mouth after the food tasting session.

The decor and ambience of the restaurant is grand and elegant. The touch of orchids here and there enhanced the look and feel of the restaurant. The grand scheme of long tables and chairs gave the restaurant a magnificent feel. The chandeliers are added attractions. The staff was prompt and efficient in servicing. I felt that the signage with the name of the restaurant is too small and it can be worked upon. Overall a very good experience and the best part is the timing of the restaurant. It's open all day. So if you are hungry and looking for a decent place to eat at the wee hours then you can drop in here for sure.

Lastly we were served the sizzling Brownie in chocolate sauce. It came in quite a good quantity and the dessert kind of refreshed our mouth after the food tasting session.

The decor and ambience of the restaurant is grand and elegant. The touch of orchids here and there enhanced the look and feel of the restaurant. The grand scheme of long tables and chairs gave the restaurant a magnificent feel. The chandeliers are added attractions. The staff was prompt and efficient in servicing. I felt that the signage with the name of the restaurant is too small and it can be worked upon. Overall a very good experience and the best part is the timing of the restaurant. It's open all day. So if you are hungry and looking for a decent place to eat at the wee hours then you can drop in here for sure.

I'm back again here in this favourite restaurant of mine. The thing i like the most over here and would like to mention again is their unmatchable hospitality.

One special mention I would like to make is of Sanjoy Nath  ,the restaurant manager.

He is a very pleasant person with a ever smiling and welcoming nature and he is also a very commited /devoted staff of this hotel .

A must visit and best for hangout buddies and groups.

The Golden Tulip Hotel has been doing really well since its grand opening in May, 2016. It is the newest 4-star hotel on the Salt Lake block and in the city. It is a part of The Louvre Hotels Group, which is one of the largest international hotel chains.

The location is convenient, being at just about 5 minutes walking distance from the City Centre-1 which practically is the heart of Salt Lake. Their restaurant, Anti Pasti, is open 24 hours for both in-house and outside guests. The d√©cor is elegant with well-spaced out seating arrangements. The dim lighting is adaptive to the soothing tone set in the ambience. Their chandeliers and crystal lights are very beautiful.

The service was fluent and the staff is friendly.

So folks that was about it from Anti Pasti at Golden Tulip Hotel.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

I was invited to the grand inauguration event of Golden Tulip Hotel at Saltlake Sector-1, Kolkata (near City Centre 1). The event was at their restaurant area Anti Pasti, with vegetarian food offerings from their kitchen. Golden Tulip is a mid-scale 4 Star Business hotel, it is a part of Louvre Hotels Group. The Louvre Hotels Group has over 1100 hotels in over 47 Countries with 6 brands. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs 8th Largest Hotel Chain. We came to know that Anti Pasti is open 24 hours for both in house guest and outside patrons. The restaurant offers wide choice of buffet breakfast and multiple options of Cuisines for lunch and dinner. On the occasion of the inauguration there was buffet snacks offered. This was the opportunity to taste the culinary skills and flavors of Golden Tulip. Though the fare offered here was vegetarian, it was a good enough spread for evening snacks.

Visited: 20/07/2016 19:30 Hrs - Dinner - Family - 18 seatsA relatively new place in salt lake, but catching up fast with help of word of mouth. The outlook of the hotel, lobby, entrance of restaurant is quite appealing.Taste - 4/5 - A refreshing new welcome for people in the area. The food tastes nice.
Ambience - 3.5/5 - Basic ambiance with a calm environment, probably because of low footfall.
Service - 4.5/5 - Staff is extremely courteous and listens to your requests with all heart.
value for money - 4.5/5 :)

Overall - 4.25 / 5

We had the oriental fare at this restaurant.
We ordered sweet corn soup, chicken lollypop, fried rice , stir fried vegetables and chicken with bbq sauce. They served a complimentary welcome drink which was Mango with basil juice.
The food was tasty. The ambience was nice. The staff was really courteous. They also served rasgullas for dessert.

First thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is it's splendid ambiance! It is just wow!

Next comes food - We had Indian lunch and i can't complain about the quality of any of the items that we had. They all tasted super. We had nun, dal makhani, chicken tikka and veg fried rice and all of them were fantastic! I would have to say that the chicken tikka was a little too oily and spicy, but no compromise on taste and quality! 

The staff there were more friendly than most of the restaurants i visited and they constantly kept a check of our glasses, refilling them with water even before we asked. That was quite nice. 
They also offered us to have one more glass of soft drink as we were about to leave which shocked me as that had never happened before!

Finally I would like to conclude by saying "This is a must go restaurant"

Visited this newly opened restaurant in Salt lake last weekend. Had a pleasant experience with variety and quality of the food; as for the service the individual attentions they give is exemplary. This could be because its newly opened, but i do hope the same kind of attention continues once the footfall increases. We tried the Indian fare which was very good. Would visit again to try other cuisine.

Update:
Tried continental and Chinese, loved both. Brownie with ice cream was amazing both presentation wise and taste. The hospitality of the new manager Sonjay Nath was wonderful. He is a connoisseur himself and his recommendations were delectably bang on. Quite an asset for the hotel industry and for foodies like us. Keep it up.

Update:

Third time lucky as they say.. Loved the entire experience once again.. The food almost like home away from home. The manager Sonjay Nath never ceases to surprise us with his culinary delights and suggestions. :)
