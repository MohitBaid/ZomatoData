Bad place, cheaters, lied about their promos. A place one should NOT go, absolutely unreliable owner and operations. More so, they don't even be honest

Tried Chicken kabab.  Delicious meal.  Had a great time.  Gonna revisit this place. The kababs taste the best in the area.  Everyone should try it.

Amazing place. Ordered for chilly chicken and fried rice, It was very nicely made and all the ingredients were very fresh. Amazing staff and a very customer centric owner.
