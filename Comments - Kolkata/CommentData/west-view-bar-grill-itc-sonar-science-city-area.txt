A #ONENOONSTAND with #AUTHENTICITALIANCUISINE.. 

Yes, it was indeed one of those rare afternoons when i literally felt like i made out with my #Italianlunch.. Well, the only person to blame for that eclectic experience would be #masterchef #GrecoVittorio who made it impossible for me to NOT FALL IN üíò with his irresistible delicacies.. Take a thousand bows chef for making this lunch a #loveaffair with #ItalianCuisine that will linger on my taste buds for eternity.. 

The foreplay started with authentic Italian üçû served alongwith ZUPPA D FUNGHI E TARTUFI ( #MUSHROOMNTRUFFLESOUP ) - it was yummy to the core with delicious mushroom & truffle served in a thick broth - a perfect start to any foodlicious love story. The foreplay gives way to a passionate climax with this mindblowing RISOTTO AI FRUTTI DI MARE ( #SEAFOODRISOTTO or Italian rice dish with seafood ) - oh man!! hands down, the best risotto you can ever have on planet üåé probably - intensely creamy and laced with all kinds of exotic seafood including seashells, üêô, prawns and what not - a perfect foreplay leading to a passionate climax now with STINCO D'AGNELO BRASATO AL VINO ( #BRAISEDJAIPURLAMBSHANKINREDWINE ) - the most tender mutton one can ever have anywhere which unbelievably melts the moment you take a bite - the exotic veggies served alongside compliments the dish perfectly adding to the overall taste and leaves your tastebuds longing for more. Yes, last but certainly not the least - it's time for that ultimate foodgasm (oops - i mean the dessert) with the help of #HAZELNUTPANACOTTA - it is that epic point of the meal when you feel like you have reached the zenith of excitement and your tastebuds go wild with all that hazelnut & chocolate melting on your tongue.. Just the look of that beautiful dessert will make you go crazy - no words to describe that ultimate high..

Really, you are still reading - come on - what are you waiting for??

Its Tuesday and as we all prepare ourselves for the dreaded Mid-Week crisis, an invitation at ITC Hotels' signature Italian brand - Ottimo was just what was needed to uplift our spirits. Joined by my team mates Anamitra, Suprotim and Ananya from Calcutta Instagrammers, we arrive at the venue for an authentic Italian 4 course lunch. What happened next just can't be explained in words as we were simply blown away by Chef Vittorio and his dishes. Thank You Arundhati di for having us over and giving us a 'never to forget' experience.

Hailing from the South of Italy, Italian Master Chef Vittorio Greco
embraced the fine art of cooking over 25 years ago during the summer of
1983 in Tuscany‚Äôs island of Elba. After a diploma in culinary science, his

inclined towards traditional Italian cuisine. A member of the Italian
worldwide Chefs Association, his culinary philosophy rests in retaining the

My Recommendations :

1. MUSHROOMS  & TRUFFLE SOUP - Looks simple but tastes amazing.
 
2. SEAFOOD RISOTTO - Rice served with Oyster, Prawn and Octopus this dish is a Killer.

Good ambience live music great staff and good food , this sums up this joint if you prefer continental grills.

We started with the ceaser sales and poached duck pears. Salad was good but the duck was okayish(xpected better).

For the main course we opted for the non veg platter and boy of boy this was a treat statting from fish prawn white meat all the way up to 
Steak. All items were fresh and delicately grilled .
I will have to mention the prawn and the salmon though the chicken was a bit stiff.

For desert we had tiramisu and it sadly we couldn't finish it after the platter üòîüòî

Oh almost forgot a live band adds to the ambience !

All in all a great dining exp !

The food here was absolutely perfect! I would recommend the Duck Confit salad, which was a delight. It was fresh, with melt-in-your-mouth shredded duck, and perfectly poached pears. The quail egg on top was a classy touch, and dressed up the dish a lot more than the balsamic vinegar reduction.
Next, we tried the milk-fed poached tenderloin, which was extremely subtle. The tuna mayonnaise it was dressed with was extremely creamy, and had no "fishy" taste. 
Finally, we ordered a mixed grill platter which had chicken, prawn, and tenderloin. This may not look or sound like much, but the food was extremely filling.
The staff was absolutely amazing, extremely courteous, and very professional. The ambience was beautiful, with the whole place dressed up in subtle yellow lights. Everything was quiet with piped music. You definitely get the exclusive, 5-star experience here! If you're thinking of a special date night, I would 100% reccomend this as the place to go. @

ITC Sonar Hotel, one of the luxury collection hotels. It has luxury lobby as I walked in to the lobby. I was there on last year Christmas'eve. 

It was great experience to spend our Christmas'eve dinner in West View Bar & Grill. We took the package that they offered was 5-course meal.
 I love the taste of different dishes from the amouse bouche to the dessert. It was just overwhelming.¬†
The service is very attentive even though we were the only couples that night for the Christmas'eve dinner. ¬†
Thank you very much for the Christmas carol and Santa Claus. It was very lovely from the ITC Sonar team.

Visited this fine dinning restaurant of ITC during the Italian festival week¬† - a great experience to norture my palette with Italian flavour. Though my palette experienced lot of Italian cuisines during my visit to Italy starting from its most northern part - Milan, Vennice, Pisa, Florence to Rome, but it was just restricted to pizza and pasta. On their recommendation I tried one of the main course Pork dish - Pork belly slowly cooked in gravy and served with potaoe wedges and veggies. Food was just out of the world and on the top of that i have the opportunity to meet Chef Vittorio Greco from Southern Italy who came¬† down to my table - its really an honor for me. A memorable evening very well spent indulging in italian cuisines along with live band music.

Update from #15YearsOfITCSonar dinner on 8th August:-

As part of their 15 years celebration, ITC Sonar has launched a 4 course set meal at 1599/- in all their specialty outlets and I was invited for their food tasting session in West View. Of all the dishes, the grilled betki was brilliant and so was the coffee laden Tiramisu. Overall, at this price point, for an experience at one of the poshest fine dining grills in town, it's definitely recommended .....¬†

Lat update:-

                        We were invited to ITC Sonar for an interactive session with the chef and menu tasting event in their West View Bar and grill. Frankly, I was impressed with Chef Greco. neither because his profile is extremely interesting, nor because, he is he had headed the michelin stared restaurants- but for the very simple reason that he made us feel at home- instantly. Just like our senior family member, he asked for our preference and seemed very happy to learn that we all are non-veg and non-allergic to any thing. And the surprising journey started. After the bread basket, the first course was FILLETO DI POLLO O ALLE ERBE E LIMONE CON SALSA TONNATA E PANE AL SESAMO. Again, I am not firing and this is the name of the dish. Basically, it‚Äôs diced chicken breast with tuna sauce and sesame seeds flavored crispy bread. More than the 3-D presentation, the taste was a combination of tangy yet non-spicy (maybe I am unable to express it). A definitely recommended dish from my side.

I was thinking this to be the surprise element, but when the soup came, WHAT was my first comment‚Ä¶.. ZUPPA DI CARCIOFI CON GORGONZOLA E CIOCCOLATO FONDENTE. Basically, Creamy artichoke soup with gorgonzola and dark chocolate. Chocolate in a hot soup ????? And it was not that bad. Definitely not the showstopper (or my palate is not adventurous enough yet), but great

Being a bong, the next dish was the showstopper. I had tasted this is the Italian consulate dinner as well, but it‚Äôs made to be served as an pre-plated a la carte dish. The poached fish braised with celery, capers and olives in a thyme in the white wine scented broth. Unlike me, those who love to taste the original taste of fish, this is pure orgasm. Definitely recommended.

As they say in Hindi, ‚ÄúUP mein aaye aur dhol nahi bajaye ???‚Äù, likewise, No dessert in an Italian meal ? Bahut na insafi hain. And, we were served the Tiramisu. Light and subtle- just the way it was supposed to be

And, at least apart from having some terrific meals, I now know few Italian dishes and how they should taste, thanks to the event.

Italian food has somehow in due course of time been able to capture a special place in our hearts and in our tummies. Some of the main reasons that cater to its success on the Indian palette are the hearty flavours, the wide variety of proteins used to create the dishes and most importantly the fantastic techniques involved in the cooking process.

A formal invitation by Arundhuti at West View Bar and Grill ensured not only great food by the Chef Vittorio but also great mocktails from Matthew and impeccably hospitable service by Sayani.
The food was beyond perfect, from the perfect balance of the lamb ravioli with the citrus jus to the burst of new flavors of the gazpacho with dark chocolate, it was beyond satisfying. Upon the end of the meal, I could safely say that the Tiramisu was the best I had ever, outside Italy.

A little overpriced, but then if I'm having alcohol at a 5 star hotel, should I be complaining about that? I think not. Sausages we ordered with the drinks were top class and so is their service. The ambience in such places is one of the priorities and they pass with flying colours.

Recommended mostly for those who would prefer a drink or two, since more than that is just not affordable by middle class people like us. Don't like very much as the ambience gets pretty dark and shady in the evening.
Food is okayish. Focuses mainly on tandoori and BBQ items. Not a must visit definitely.

This is the only restaurant in ITC which serves u proper grilled and non veg extravaganza which is not very yummy for the Indians. This is just my feeling coz I din like the taste much. Very authentic continental and sea food which I personally don't like. Shot expensive with amazing interiors and service.

The limited menu and the ambience makes this truly a grill restaurant unlike many who are branded as a grill and then end up with dal and noodles on the menu .

The food is fresh, made to order and grilled to perfection. 

They do have a band playing there on most nights which is quite good if u a little away from them but things tend to get loud if u sitting may where near them. 

I did see a private dining room in the corner for a larger groups. Which I think is a great idea as they do tend to get noisy and spoil the meal experience of others.

A definite must visit !!!

In contrast to its counterpart at ITC Mayura at Delhi called "West View: The Grill Room", the¬† restaurant at ITC Sonar is named "West View Bar & Grill".¬† As a consequence, the attention has shifted more to the "Bar" part from the "Grill" part. I have nothing against bars per se, but my experience says that when such a thing happens, the food quality tends to go down and that is what has happened here. I am not saying the duck that I had was bad, but it was not of a very high standard which one expects from an expensive fine dining restaurant. Also some of their more exotic imported cuts were not available which is a big turn off for me. When you are such a big name expensive place, you got to make sure that the items listed on the menu are available on demand. Overall a decent place, but may not be worth it if you a mainly interested in the "grill" part.

Was there tonight for a fine dining experience. If you r steak lover, well u r heading to the right place. We had ordered seafood paella (it actually is a spanish dish garnished with rice, baby octopus, prawns,lobsters & some bong fishes as well), tenderloin steak & tiramisu(with chocolate trifle & coffee beans) with red wine. Well, being fond of neither seafood nor steaks, I can rate the food well within average as I didn't find it lipsmackin' for self. However one might like it as per varying choice. They also have grill buffet which costs around 2300 bucks & it has mostly seafoods & a few chicken items.

After sitting for 10 minutes to write this review, i realize writing about 5 star restaurants is not easy. I mean what can one say about the ambience, decor, interiors etc. They are all obviously top of the line. 
ITC Sonar offers 4-5 speciality restaurants catering to different cuisines. West View excels in grilled food and their stocked bar.  Since we were staying at ITC, we decided to try the 2-3 restaurants and started here.
Ordering drinks took no time, a long island ice tea and hoegaarden. For starters we decided to go with Tiger prawn cocktail. The Liit was wonderfully mixed giving a very smooth taste. The prawn cocktail though decent in quantity and presentation, tasted a bit bland. No particular flavor to give the taste a punch. It was like eating salad with prawns in it. 
Unfortunately my friend got an allergy from the prawns ( no fault of the restaurant here) ending our eating spree abruptly. We contacted the hotel staff who helped us to procure anti allergies. 
Overall it was a decent experience, and not something spectacular to remember by.

We were gifted a 3 course meal at West View and were kicked about it. What I associate the ambience here with - power suits :) As soon as were seated, we presented our voucher. Immediately there was some confusion around it. They were perfectly polite about sorting it out but we were uneasy and bothered the whole time, and it took a long time. This process needs to be reworked. I get where they are coming from but it does not work for the guest. With that out of the way, let's move on.

It has been a while so please forgive the partial details I provide. Our maitre d' helpfully suggested a couple of wines. I am a wine tyro, all I know is that it was a cabernet and I didn't exactly love it. No fan of salads and the bitter lettuce ruined the other fun components of pine nuts and cherry tomatoes. For first course, I chose a grilled camembert dish, fully expecting it not to be for the faint hearted. I turned out to be right. The hunk of molten cheese was delicious of course! But there was too much of it. My own doing but I was guilt ridden by the end of it. The grill section understandably holds no excitement for vegetarians. While my companion savored the meats, all of which were beautifully done, I tasted the bland vegetables and saved my appetite. Main course was a home-cooked style spaghetti. It was lovely. The simple flavors, the drizzle of olive oil, the strength to the pasta and the very correct portion size all made for a huge win. For dessert, I went with my mandatory tiramisu and it was one of the best I have ever had. The presentation was amateurish but on flavor, it scored. The triple chocolate mousse, on the other hand, was disappointing.

Overall, some things worked, some things did not but this was indeed a special experience.

After sitting for 10 minutes to write this review, i realize writing about 5 star restaurants is not easy. I mean what can one say about the ambience, decor, interiors etc. They are all obviously top of the line. 
ITC Sonar offers 4-5 speciality restaurants catering to different cuisines. West View excels in grilled food and their stocked bar.  Since we were staying at ITC, we decided to try the 2-3 restaurants and started here.
Ordering drinks took no time, a long island ice tea and hoegaarden. For starters we decided to go with Tiger prawn cocktail. The Liit was wonderfully mixed giving a very smooth taste. The prawn cocktail though decent in quantity and presentation, tasted a bit bland. No particular flavor to give the taste a punch. It was like eating salad with prawns in it. 
Unfortunately my friend got an allergy from the prawns ( no fault of the restaurant here) ending our eating spree abruptly. We contacted the hotel staff who helped us to procure anti allergies. 
Overall it was a decent experience, and not something spectacular to remember by.

We were gifted a 3 course meal at West View and were kicked about it. What I associate the ambience here with - power suits :) As soon as were seated, we presented our voucher. Immediately there was some confusion around it. They were perfectly polite about sorting it out but we were uneasy and bothered the whole time, and it took a long time. This process needs to be reworked. I get where they are coming from but it does not work for the guest. With that out of the way, let's move on.

It has been a while so please forgive the partial details I provide. Our maitre d' helpfully suggested a couple of wines. I am a wine tyro, all I know is that it was a cabernet and I didn't exactly love it. No fan of salads and the bitter lettuce ruined the other fun components of pine nuts and cherry tomatoes. For first course, I chose a grilled camembert dish, fully expecting it not to be for the faint hearted. I turned out to be right. The hunk of molten cheese was delicious of course! But there was too much of it. My own doing but I was guilt ridden by the end of it. The grill section understandably holds no excitement for vegetarians. While my companion savored the meats, all of which were beautifully done, I tasted the bland vegetables and saved my appetite. Main course was a home-cooked style spaghetti. It was lovely. The simple flavors, the drizzle of olive oil, the strength to the pasta and the very correct portion size all made for a huge win. For dessert, I went with my mandatory tiramisu and it was one of the best I have ever had. The presentation was amateurish but on flavor, it scored. The triple chocolate mousse, on the other hand, was disappointing.

Overall, some things worked, some things did not but this was indeed a special experience.

Nice interior arrangements and style. Not very flamboyant but quite compact in space. Food preparation is quite nice with very succulent cod fish in the menu. Good ambience with well mannered attendance to customers makes this place upto the standard of restaurants in ITC Sonar Bangla. Magnificent Tiramisu served here. So far the best after Spaghetti Kitchen of Elgin road, forum mall. The main course choices are a bit less diverse and not very good for a heavy lunch.

It is a must for grill and sea food lovers
Baby octopus in lemon garlic sauce is too good and so are the deserts!!

The grill room of ITC lives up to their name with their delectable cuts of meat and the cooking which makes them fall of the bone.
We tried the poached beckti and pan-seared duck, both of which were excellent (though the gherkin risotto did not pair well with the duck). 
The standout dish of the day was Ossobucco beef shank. Excellent in taste and quality of meat, even the marrow in the hole was soft and delicious. Must-try. 
We also tried a grilled Camembert as starter, which was great too.

Between Zomato and the West View Bar and grille,the grille came much earlier.So do not know whether to call this a review or reminiscence.Kolkatas best steaks used to be served at the now defunct Blue Fox,By the Way at Taj Bengal and the Calcutta and the Bengal Clubs.Some say the Olypub Chateau de Briand is good,maybe sometime in the past but not the last 10 years definitely.Mocambo and Peter Cat do not serve authentic steaks.There was a place called Steam some years back on B.C.Road but it's become a car showroom now.
It is with this historical perspective that one has to view the West View.Probably the only place in Kolkata today which serves Steaks and Grilled meat the way they are supposed to be served.The cuts are supreme,the flavour intact,the sauces on the side and the lava stone on which they serve the meat both novel and utilitarian since you can yourself prepare your steak the way you want it.
Some months back they also served a mean Fois Gras but believe it is banned now.
I love their live band as also their personalised service.They remember me by name and cater to my whims.I love the place.
It is pricey but what the heck?This is a place you go for occasions unless you are staying at the hotel and at the risk of sounding elitist,I shall say that the fruits of ones hard work has to be well spent.Amen....

Fantastic place. Lovely ambience, service and food. They have options of alacarte and there is also a course menu as per choice which can contain a soup, grills and desert. I opted for the course menu and had a filling meal. Food palate is european with clean mild taste, more natural than spicy. Overall a great place to spend a quiet evening. Has my thumbs up

Ranjan rocks this place...surely my second home when it comes to this watering hole...he has the best mixes in town...

The new entrants are not that savvy, so do ask for Ranjan and enjoy his award winning turnouts

The is awesome and well decorated. Hospitality should be good as its in ITC SONAR. I am actually not a fan of continental but this place has made me have it and complimented it. One should once go to it and he will drive in again for sure.

Without a doubt, the bestest steak in town! Remember how you see steaks on TV and they say it's a perfectly juicy piece of meat? That's exactly what you get here. If you're more of a seafood person (like me) the Seafood paella is unspeakably good. Grills and cold cuts are aplenty. Sit at the bar and enjoy your single malts or take the wine glasses to your tables. If your pockets are loaded, don't miss this place.

This place was our favorite when Chef Partho and chef Suniti were there. It never got it right after that.
I was a regular here but now don't visit due to the poor quality and taste of food.

If you are a meat lover and like your grills and cols-cuts there is no finer place to dine at than the West View Bar & Grill. Yes its very expensive so do keep that in mind but if you can afford it its a fantastic gastronomical experience. It has a fabulous selection of Cheese , Cold Cuts, Roasts and Grills on offer. Its quite an experience to watch your selection being prepared on the Rock Grill which is a preheated lava stone and gives one the opportunity to be a part of the preparation of ones meal.
The Live Seafood Grill is fantastic with the freshest of produce from the world on offer. The superb Bratwurst Sausages I sampled here are undoubtedly the best I have had in the city and their Sea Food Paella is in a class of its own.  For the dessert selection , there are puddings,crepes, gateaux and mousses on offer and they are just the best way to finish a brilliant meal. Fantastic Cocktails and the finest of wines, cognacs and high-end malts are available.. The Grill takes the gourmet straight to Cloud 9 !

If you are a steak lover, this is the place to be. I have to admit, the times I have come here, I have always opted for steak (and they do have a number of great options) and I have NEVER been disappointed. On my last visit, asked them for a medium rare,  and they did the most perfect one - red and juicy on the inside with the perfect char on the outside. Overall, if you want to indulge, this is the place to be!

Have money to spend and want to explore world cuisine head over to West View Bar and Grill. Dynamic menu and wide selection of grills. The lava rock grills and the foie gras are must trys. Wide ranging choice of wines to complement the food. However, the dessert selection was a little disappointing.

By far the most disappointing restaurant experience I have ever had. The service here is just the worst you'll find in Calcutta. Its a shame that they cant even put on a smile. The food here is like fodder. And if you are vegetarian I dnt think you'll like the fact the unavoidable smell of beef on the grill.

Horrible food considering it's a 5 star hotel's restaurant. The buffet selection left much to be desired, and the food was well below average. I do not think it's worth the high price.

I love to dine at West View Bar & grill being a continental food lover. Perfect for an elegant and romantic evening with your significant other.Food is delicious. The desserts were also amazing. Loved their mud pie. Best part of the evening was the live music. Enjoying good food with live beautiful songs of the 80s and 90s is certainly worth trying.The singer also sang a song by the Carpenters on our special request. Overall,a magnificent dining experience.Can't wait to try West View in ITC Maurya. :)Recommended to all foodies.¬†
Life is a beautiful journey..Live it well..

I would go back here again and again,not simply for the food, but for the live music playing in the evenings. Where else could you go listen to the cello while biting into some lovely food?!

This is one of those places where you must go and lose yourself-DONT keep track of time. Just sink into your seat and wait for the delicious food to arrive.

Since I don't eat red meat,I wouldn't be able to recommend their grilled meat preparations( they have quite a few) but I was very satisfied with their grilled fish. What I like is their beautifully fresh ingredients. They do have good variety and the staff recommend good stuff. 

I liked their chocolate based desserts. 

Amiable staff,lovely decor. :)

I like it ! But friends any meal here is going to cost a fortune and you better not put a stop watch on your dinner time. Seat and enjoy. 

The menu reads well.  A wide selection of grills promises big lumps of serious meat and fish; on order comes your fresh salad and soup of your choice.  Caesar and chopped salads are a step above average ‚Äì well-dressed and full of flavor. Nothing here looks over elaborate. The place of course, is a curse and a blessing. It's a blessing because this is the stuff we really want to eat. The curse - its atrociously priced. 

Deserts disappointment. When I first started going there is was interesting, now it's lame. They seriously should spice it up. 

Back to the main course - it has endless options of raw meats and wide selection for seafood - beef, lamb cuts, prawns ( large), chicken cuts, ducks breast, bratwurst sausage, pork sausage etc. They also offer some interesting cocktails, top dollar wines, cognacs and single malts - sure to keep ya in high spirits, but you will wish they were cheap at half the price ;D 

There is a live band and that along with the attentive service sets them aside and makes it a top of the must visit list. 

Food for thought - go there if ya have money to burn - know what I mean... If you do, you won't regret though... 

Happy dining!
