Good food. Great quantity. Affordable prices. Discount as a college student (doesn't help much though).
This sums up the place.
A nice one if you crave some good Chinese with a great appetite.

Great food at very affordable prices.... must try for momos n Chinese. Home & office delivery is also done by them through zomato order or by calling them directly. Their quantity is massive and taste finger licking good. I have tried their Indian, Tibetan and Chinese dishes which all were good.

Recently I had ordered crispy chicken legs(2pcs) and mixed chowmein(the day earlier).I often order the former dish from swiggy since its my favourite.To my greatest disappointment I found out that the mayonese dip which they serve regularly  was missing that day.I inquired of the matter to the staff present and to be honest he was very rude.Since it was quite late the food served was also not of the expected quality.Thoroughly disappointed of the behaviour as well as food!(No complaints for the chowmein though)

You want quick roadside food, you can stop by. Rolls and chowmein are more opted, but you can opt for rotis and some side dish as well.

Not much place to sit but food is okay.

Located in my vicinity this takeaway has saved us the trouble of cooking on several occasions. I've tried most of their dishes. They serve delicious food. From Egg chicken roll to Laccha Paratha, from Chicken Noodles to Mixed Fried Rice and from Chilli Chicken to Chicken Reshmi Kebab I love them all. The Chicken Lollipop here is my favorite.
We often get their food home delivered with a very less additional delivery charge. We also once happened to pre-order them food for 40 people for one of our house parties. They delivered the food absolutely in time and the guests loved it.

Today we ordered of "veg noodles" and "veg fried rice" from "Food Plaza". This restaurant located in beleghata. The taste of the "veg fried rice" was ok type not upto the mark and the taste of the"veg noodles" was not at all good,it disappointed me a lot coz noodles was very dry and smelly along with gravy i didn't get that taste which i thought. Quantity of the noodles and fried rice was good. As it was home delivery we got the food on time. After submitting the review i directly got the call from the restaurant and they listen everything and they arranged for the same menu free of cost, it's really a nice gesture and this time noodles was good.

Tried ordering from Zomato for the first time. The experience wasn't that good. I was notified that my parcel would reach me by 7.45 and it reached at 8.05 pm. Point deducted there.
Coming to my order, I had ordered for a Vanilla Ice cream, a Lime Soda and a Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce. The vanilla ice cream was done by 4 spoonfuls. It was so less compared to the price. The chocolate sauce one tasted like burnt chocolate and the quantity was less again. The two cherries on top didn't do much to justify the price. The lime soda was kinda good. It was refreshing but it had a bit more masala to it. I really can't recommend this place to anybody.

Ordered for the first time. The good thing is I got a call immediately from Food Plaza. I requested for non spicy food and thus he said Mutton Afghani which I ordered is actually spicy. The guy was polite and suggested I should opt for Mutton Dopiaza instead if non spicy food is preferred. We decided to follow his suggestion and since I made a pre payment the guy said he will be sending a fruit salad to match the price difference.
Mushroom Bharta was fantastic. I had home made rotis which went absolutely well with it. Chilli Chicken dry was as expected. Mutton Dopiaza tasted good but had the usual Mutton smell dominating the dish which is somewhat erm... unpleasant. Fruit salad was excellent. Overall .. satisfactory. Will recommend to all. :)

Just for fun guys, guess what dish it is from the picture. 

That is supposed to be chicken "kasha". I am not expecting anything authentic but atleast something similar. The dish served was just like a chinese gravy with bone chicken pieces. Onion pieces and small tomatoes were the only thing in the gravy.   Really poor experience.

Well, more than 25 years of residence at Phoolbagan – still, I was not aware of this place – which is situated not far away – in Beliaghata! 

Today, I ordered their Punjabi Aloo Dum as well as Paneer Butter Masala for home delivery – which was delivered in less than an hour (they charge a few bucks extra for home delivery – mind it!). Packing was fine, so was the quantity as well as quality of the fodder. Food presentation was also great – especially the Punjabi Aloo dum and even the Punjabi dhabas would have envied the same.

What really was lacking - the most important aspect – TASTE! Aloo dum seemed devoid of any spices or salt. Same with Paneer. The niggard coriander pieces over the aloo dum did compensate to some extent – but definitely not the whole of it – and we had a difficult time completing our meal. We somehow got through with the help of some condiments arranged at home!

May be it was a bad day – both for me as well as them – otherwise, Zomato reviews for this place establish it as a fine restaurant. Hope I get a better main course the next time I order from them.

This little food joint is close to my college and so I am a regular visitor to this place.  It is an AC restaurant and the food is cheap and tasty. Though it is a little clumsy inside, it is clean and hygienic to have food here. The waiters are well mannered. Huge quantity of food is served. Even half a plate of rice or noodle should suffice two people. It is that great.

I have mostly tried chinese food from this place. Chicken Lollipop is my favourite here. Mixed Fried Rice is again a good option while ordering.
They have plenty of options in their menu. Only been disappointed with their veg items.

The name itself suggests about the temptation it offers, especially for those tired, hungry college students who are returning home after a hectic day. 
The restaurant offers a variety of food items, starting from the tender tandoori roti to the spicy chicken curry, that will add relief to your growling stomach and soothe the taste buds of your tongue. The price range is quite moderate and suitable for each and every working class, which only adds to the many positive points of this restaurant. Common food items like rolls and noodles are prepared with care and ingredients in the correct proportion. 
Being a new restaurant, one of its most important disadvantages is its location, since it's not exactly located on the main road but one has to walk a few meters down a side-lane. Another factor is the limited space availability of the restaurant.
But if you want to taste a few good bites, then note down the address! :)
