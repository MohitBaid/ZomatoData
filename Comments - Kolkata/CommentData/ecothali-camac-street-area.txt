Ordered once. The food was never delivered. Do not have the courage to order again. Such is the quality of service that the delivery personnel did not even contact me asking for any directions or any assistance. Now i doubt whether this place actually exists or not.
 Not recommended at all.

We placed an order for  70 veg thalis for a training programme at our organization... We were a bit sceptical while ordering d food as reviews of late delivery was a big concern... But then they promised to deliver on tym and they were dot on tym... 

Cuming to the veg thali... 

Well presented... They had given jeera rice, mix veg, salad, papad, dal fry.... Added to dat there was a spoon, salt, toothpick, tissue and pickle all in a separate plastic sachet....

Food quality was good hence we decided to place d order for the next day too. 
Definitely recommended

Very unprofessional place ,I called up to place my order and they said to back up my order with a message .No delivery was done and they said that no msg was received common courtesy should have prevailed and a call back should have been done if they didn't receive the msg .I called up 4 times from 1pm onwards and they kept saying we will call back .sad and disappointed that this is the way customers are treated .

Completely waste of time this is. They deliver food after 2:30 hours minimum. Their service is the most pathetic and the calls are handled by rude people who barely know how to speak. It's name should be CheapoThali. I ordered food at 12:08 PM and it got delivered at 2:20 PM. This isn't the first time they are treating customers like this. It's their habit now.

Didn't have a pleasant experience. Ordered for veg thali this noon. But the packaging didn't contain any spoon or napkin. They gave me large amount of potato curry with 3 potatoes. But very small amount of aloo kabli. It was a veg thali but didn't have paneer.

Great food and outstanding customer service.  Quantity is sufficient for one person if you want to stay in shape without compromise on taste, definitely rare combination.

Will  tell my friends and family to try Eco Thali..

It's month end so my wallet is a bit cranky, but paet ko kya farak padta hai, usko toh khana mangta hai... So me and my friends were looking online for cheap and hyeginic lunch, then one of us came across Eco Thali... The menu wasn't so hard on the pocket, ₹ 65 for a full veg thali and ₹ 80 for non veg. We ordered both for a try and guess what, it surprised us!
The food was at my doorstep instantly (20mins), 
The packaging was something new and pleasure to eye, inside a printed cardboard wrapper was the thali presented well in a use and throw thal, air tightly sealed with no spillage and came with condiments and a good quality spoon. Well coming to the taste and quality , surprisingly it tasted so good we loved the side dishes, the rice was a good quality well cooked, with 2 chapatis and salad and fine quantity of papad, the daal was very nice, thick and tasted so good, the paneer really tasted so good and the chicken stew was well and thoroughly cooked and yumm , it was hard to believe that the thali came so cheap and tasted so good, I'm highly impressed by Eco Thali and it's so good for hostelers , office goers a thorough whole meal which is tasty and is easy on pocket. Im gonna redial eco thalis number soon!

Food served hot. Amazing quality. Quantity is ideally enough for lunch. Great packing. @just Rs.80 a chicken meal delivered at home is just unimaginable.  Apart from Rice/rotis and three items, the pack included salad, salt, pickle, mouth freshener, tooth pick and a paper napkin..Wah

The service was delayed, the food was terribly prepared (esp Dal which had way too much garlic) and the quantity sucked. The Rotis were way too small; the amount of rice can easily be reduced by a little and the roti size/quantity increased. 
For ₹65 - the meal is a steal. But quantity and quality need to be really upped (tried it just for kicks). @Urban Rasoi is much better (slightly higher price point.

A very pocket friendly place with good quantity food but food  quality is not that good , food tasted average, bland. 
Service was quick , with nice staffs.
They must increase the price to enhance the food quality.
Good for office going people and students , who don't bring tiffin from home.

We ordered a Veg Thali, being economical was the only good thing about it. The food was Very Bad ... Pathetic taste, low quality preparation and overdose of Garlic in all vegetables. Will never recommend the thali atleast!

I really liked the veg meal of Ecothali. 
It was very nicely packed and came with a complimentary packet containing napkin, spoon, achar, passpass and salt. I really had difficulty in unpacking the dish and it kinda got spilled in the process. Would really recommend to lessen the use of plastic. 

The food was overall pretty good and economical for 65 bucks. It has 2 rotis, a lumpsome amount of rice, alur dom (potato curry), shahi paneer, dal and papad. Really a nice experience. Great homemade food for corporate people.

The BEST office lunch delivery service in town; No two ways about it. The quality of food is second to none, and so is the overall experience of ordering, delivery and packaging. The fact that their menus are different everyday makes it exciting to order everyday :) They've thought of the user experience through and through and overall it screams Value!

The food is absolutely sumptuous with an affordable price.  The hygiene level is well maintained and the quality too. While spending our peak lunch time in a worked up place,the food delivered is so hassel free and makes me feel at home with its taste and quality. The delivery time is taken care of as well. I would surely suggest every office goer to place an order right away and enjoy the home made meal.

We ordered a veg and nonveg thali to try it out. Delivery was efficient and the food arrived hot and well presented in a modern box with a spoon, hand sanitiser, mouth freshener, salt, chutney etc. The both the thalis were tasty and filling for lunch. Check out their website, it's great and has a great menu. The prices are lower than other thalis in restaurants. I look forward to ordering again.
