Had ordered dry chilly chicken and chicken fried rice as we could not find any other open eateries serving Chinese nearby. And boy oh boy, how badly we regretted our decision. The fried rice was weird and tasted SO bad, the chicken pieces were equally bad. Not justified the high pricing.

Ordered "fish fry" from here at my cousin's place. Simple and tasty food is what comes to my mind. No complains about the food but some of the photos added here is fake as all my expert foodies will surely notice!

Delicious & cheap food. Love their Chinese. Whenever I'm busy with work or there's a house party I order from them. Very reliable delivery service.

Great food at a very affordable price. Prompt and efficient home delivery. I tried chilli chicken and hakka chowmien and both were really great, especially at the prices they're offered. Hard to beat at this price.

Update: opted for home delivery for the 2nd consecutive day. Tried a variety of stuff, everything tasted really well. Especially the chicken kababs were amazing. Quantity of food was more than adequate, as well. I found it to be quite a bit more than another nearby restaurant which I used to order food from prior to the existence of this one.

If you want food at a good quality and at a cheaper rate. This is the best place to get in. Must try chicken kabab and crispy chicken! Chinese is also fab here.
People who want great ambiance. This is not the place for you. But if you love only food. Please visit.
