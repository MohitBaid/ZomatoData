This is a gem in Shakuntala Park. The starters and momos are really good. Have ordered variety of dishes on multiple visits. Their menu has been changed and rates have increased which is not included in Zomato. 
Recommended!

Ambiance is quite good.Not a really spacious outlet yet it's good for a hangout.We visited there on Teachers Day.
We have ordered chicken hakka noodles and dry chilli chicken.Yes it took sometimes ,as they were cooking it.
We just loved the food.It tastes great.

This was our first visit to this little Chinese eating houses and trust me its truly cosy and we were satisfied with the food as well as the ambience.

We ordered -

‚Ä¢Chicken Pan Fried Momo for Starters and they were quite well prepared. Perfect blend of spices that would surely rejuvenate your taste buds. It contains 6 pieces.

Next for the main course we had -

‚Ä¢Veg Schezwan fried rice which was an authentic one as well.

‚Ä¢Accompanying that we ordered Hot Garlic Chicken which was too good not much spicy but moderate and well prepared

‚Ä¢Also had Mixed American Chopsuey which was very tasty.Lots of chicken lots of shrimps and lots of veggies overall a big thumbs up üëç 

And the best part is that the prices are all inclusive of GST so don't have to worry about extra tax.And just to give an extra information,our total bill came up to ‚Çπ535 quite cheap!! Do give it a try.

I have been here quite a few times let's check out pros and cons.

Pros - Wide variety of dishes.
- Significantly less waiting time.
- Considerable Price.
- No GST
- Staffs and waiters are well mannered.
- Quite beautiful place and ambient

Cons - Most of the chicken dishes tastes similar. (I could be wrong, haven't tried all)
- Some dishes are quite spicy and oily. ( Traditionally they aren't much)
- Limited seating 4-5 tables.
Altogether it's pretty much recommended place to dine.
Happy Eating.

today for lunch we ordered 2 Mixed Fried Rice and 1 Drunken Chicken Gravy through swiggy!

review;
Mixed Fried Rice was ok! it was full of chicken, egg, prawns but there were prawn shells and also it was having stone powder in bengali we say kich kich :/
Drunken Chicken Gravy (8 Pcs) was ok but the chickens were harder also the gravy was less.. 

in total it was an average experience..

PS they take GST....

So they had a wierd rule of not taking card on orders below rs 300. So you can't take a quick bite if you don't have cash. Which is disappointing.  So I'm giving all my rating for the food quality.

After that we had went there several times and had momos, fried rice, baby corn, desserts, many side dish and starters. It is quite affordable  with no extra charge.

This Restaurant is sure to give you a First Treat Delight thus making you fall into its Customer Loyalty Trap..!!!!
¬†I have been ordering food at my place from this restaurant since quite a long time. But, after a few experiences I encountered since the last 2 Orders, i m myself startled and have decided to QUIT Ordering from this Restaurant. 
1st Order : Had ordered for 2 Plates of Mixed fried Rice along with Hong Kong Fish. all these 3 came in 3 Separate Boxes which was Good bt , The Mixed Fried Rice was Terrible..!!!! ¬† Quantity of each packet of Mixed Fried Rice was like Half Plate and the pieces of chicken,egg, prawn made me feel that i m eating left overs..!!!! 
2nd Order : Had ordered for 2 Plate Fried Prawn in 5 Spice Sauce . And, they decided to club it in ONE BOX thus reducing the amount of gravy thus making me feel super sure that the working staff here is so intelligent to even recognise the¬† needs of mine and who do i want to fetch the order for. To be precise, i had ordered one of the plate¬† for my neighbour as she was ill and wanted to eat from a good restaurant. 
Even, a Hugh Amount of Arrogance was seen from the Fellow Managerial Staff of the restaurant when i had called him up to state my grievance and had asked for a replacement

And, in the very phase of Digitization and Demonetization in the whole of nation, this restaurant still cannot keep up the pace of getting digitized and feels no shame to grab on the hard queued cash recieved by the public who just wants to enjoy good food, as it neither favours PayTm or POS service .

This place truly have become one of my favourite Chinese joint in Kolkata. If they were placed in easily accessible location they could have been city's favourite too...
Almost tried everything from their menu, and each of the items has its delightful uniqueness. The quality of food they serve that too without making a big hole in your pocket is the best thing. Though they have reduced their serving amount a bit recently.
My pick from their menu will be mixed dan dan noodles, chicken three pepper ginger fried rice, chicken preparations in oyster sauce, lemon butter and honey chilli sauce, fried prawns in five spice.

This placed opened in the pujas in 2014 and I was maybe among the first customers to the restaurant.. Though there was a puja rush, they didn't falter in service or quality which is quite commendable.
After passing of few days, this place became the hot favourite for me and my friends in the locality due to their good quality Chinese food in quite a reasonable price.. But after a few days I gradually started degrading in quality and taste and once I remember I had to throw away a whole dish of fish because it was undercooked and also tasted revolting.. So we avoided the place for some time.
But for the past 4-5 months they have redeemed themselves and again are serving food of great quality and good taste.

The little negatives I would say are the quality of prawn they give and their very odd concept of giving not so good food in their home delivery.

Some of the must try dishes are: US Corn Pepper Salt, Seafood Siu Mai, Gravy Chowmein, Mushroom Pepper Salt, Chicken Kung Pao, Chicken in White Wine sauce..

Easy to locate as it is located on the main road near chowrasta muchipara, just a few steps before the LIC training office.
Ambience is good plus the service is quick too. The place is not too big but its well maintained. Clean and well decorated, decoration is not hi fi but its good.
Main attraction is their menu. Awesomely elabortaed menu. Specializes in dishes like wantons, noodles ,oyster fish etc etc. Dishes are so tasty, loved it. Chicken wanton soup was wow.
Prices are good and pocket friendly.
Only disappointment is that they don't have a washroom in their restaurant, only a wash basin outside to wash your hands.

This place is a wonder. At the first sight, you won't believe that this place can serve the quality of the food it serves. We had chicken in oyster sauce, mixed Dan Dan Noodles and Mixed Noodles. The food quality was good and sufficient for three of us. The only thing that bugged me a little bit was the time they took to serve the food. Highly recommended place, the hole in the pocket was also low compared to the quality of the food.

A small joint with capacity 25 to 30 people to sit, serves Chinese dishes cannot throw a wonder. That was the feeling I had when I saw this place first time.¬†
I was wrong; I sensed that I might be wrong the moment I saw the menu card, it had all the known famous Chinese stuff and more, it was long, 6 pages (IIRC).

We ordered Lat Mi Kai and Yongchow Fried Rice with Pan Fried Momo. To our surprise everything was so well made that I felt this place is best in the locality

I even went a step further and said with kind of value for money it is serving it may be better than Hatari. 

Then I thought again about Hatari and kind of raw material and portions they use I feel it is short of Hatari's standard. But the very fact that I considered

this over Hatari for a short period of time it is evident enough that they are on the right track.

Where they can improve? Use good portions of chicken in side and starter dishes. The wheat dough does not make a good Chilli Chicken but takes the experience

away from the customer. So if you are a food lover and have a bit less money but you want the best for your bucks in Biren Roy Road (west), go for this joint.

I am going 3.5 star out of 5 for simply then best Chinese experience in the locality.

Nice little restaurant here in Sakuntala Park and it really serves good food.
I had ordered takeaway of Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and Chilli Chicken. The rice was nice and well cooked with the right amount of flavour. It was filling as well and the portions of prawn, egg and chicken were quite good. The chilli chicken could have been made better according to me and needs a bit more supervision while cooking. The Manchurian dish was much better and all in all it made for a lovely dinner.
Quick meal, cheap price, good taste - place to go if you are in this side of the city.

I am a very finicky person and you could say a very choosy eater when it comes to eating outside or ordering from anywhere else. Okay so here;s the thing. I had my mother's memorial service this Sunday and I had around 15 people over for lunch. On Saturday while taking a walk down (late i was in deciding the menu) my area, i stumbled across CHILLI GARLIC. The staff was very courteous and welcoming, and I asked them for a leaflet, so i could go home and order for the next days menu. My friend and I sat and decided the menu-

Veg Garlic noodles, Chicken dipped in manchurian, Cottage cheese in manchurian, Confetti veg fried rice. I told them I needed the items delivered by 12 noon the next day- to my surprise it was on time (very rare with home deliveries in Behala).

The memorial service was a hit and so was the lunch, everyone had their full and guess what, each box was neatly wrapped with condiments, extra sauces and more to make anyone happy- we had two boxers of rice left over, coz of the huge amount they serve (value for money), which we warmed and had for the night.

This noon, i felt a little lazy to cook, so I ordered chicken chiili garlic noodles from them, and it was delivered in 10 minutes

MY FINAL WORD- CHILLI GARLIC, YOU HAVE ME AS A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR LIFE <3 keep up the good work folks!

I have dined here and also ordered for a home delivery..chinese dishes at a very pocket friendly price. I have tried 40% of the dishes and no complains so far. A fine family restaurant with a friendly ambiance.

If u want to have a good Tibetan food then try chicken pan fried Momo,its fantabulous no doubt about that and if u love to have Chinese then go for all types of noodles especially the chicken Hakka noodles for starter all are very crispy and tasty and to be specific try chicken drums in heaven ....the place is in a bit remote region but  in one word its awesome .........üòãüòãüòã

Me and my mom's favourite hangout! We visit this place as often as we can.. Cozy ambience immediately lifts the mood! The food is served in plenty and a dinner for two costs merely 300 bucks! Excellent management by the owner who is a lady and no one can beat the chinese taste! With a little push this nice, small restaurant can go a long way!

I found its leaflet with the news paper a few days back. So thought of visiting the place as its close to where i stay. I was there last week with a friend of mine and found it to be a good place. A plus for me as you all know about the love i have for small eat houses. Its a place with a capacity of 20 people. It serves Chinese foods and thus we ordered Chicken Drumsticks (Drums of heaven) and the mixed american chopsuey . It wasn't something extraordinary but was good in taste and was also good in amount which made me take a parcel of Diced Fish in choice of sauces which had a few selection of sauces and i chose szechwan sauce.
Over all a good place and the staffs were friendly as well and quick.
Pocket Pinch - 500 for two inc. taxes.¬†
They don't accept card so don't forget to carry cash or else you need to run to the close by ATM as i did :)

What more can I ask for!!! Delicious food at your doorstep. A perfect treat for my taste buds. Very reasonably priced. Very tasty food. My favourite was Diced Chicken in Lemon Butter sauce. Also Veg Stir Fry and 3 Pepper Fried Rice is worth trying for those who prefer less spicy dishes. Variety of choice for sauces. I have also tasted Steamed Fish in Honey Mustard Sauce. I would definitely recommend.

Ordered food to be delivered at home from this place. They said it won't take more than half hour but the food arrived after 50 mins. The momo was delicious. Chilli garlic noodles served in great quantity and tasty too. The chilli paneer was a disappointment since it was sweet.

Chilli garlic gives you decent chinese cuisine at affordable rates. You can always go there for a quick bite, or a sumptuous dinner. 
They have a variety of dishes all which gives you a break from same old chinese ones. 
The staff is very courteous and will serve you with a smile, though be very careful to mention which part of your order would you like to be served first. 
Didn't like the dessert sectipn. Need more variety.
Overall a 4.5 from my side.

Today we have arranged a small birthday party of my son here (obviously after getting n number of +ve reviews). The overall experience is just AWESOEME!!!!  They have arranged the space so intelligently that we never felt that space is overcrowded.  Tables and chairs were arranged perfectly.

Menu was

‚Ä¢	Chicken Sweet Corn Soup

‚Ä¢	Pan fried Fish

‚Ä¢	Crisply baby corn

‚Ä¢	Fried Rice

‚Ä¢	Mixed Veg. Butter Garlic

‚Ä¢	 Diced Chicken Sweet N Sour Sauce

‚Ä¢	Dar Saan With Vanilla Ice-Cream

All the items were very good specially Soup, Pan Fried Fish and Chicken Sweet n Sour and obviously darsaan. Most amazing thing they served all the food hot for more than 2 hours (Hot means direct from oven!). The cost is very much moderate.

The thing which I must mention over here is the attitude of the staffs. Starting from ever smiling owners to serving staffs everyone is very much cooperative.  Their team effort is really commendable. They took care of every mundane things. 

Really a very good places for small get together.

Today morning at around 11 am, me and brother were feeling super hungry and didnt want to have regular home food. We wanted to try something new and we totally love Chinese. So, we decided to try 2 dishes from this resto just to be on safe side considering we live in Sarsuna housing which is not such a happening place so we were wondering whether the food is going to be good or not.

We ordered Chicken American Chopsuey after reading Nilanjana's review and Veg steamed momos. The momos melted in our mouths like butter. They are really superb. And the American Chhopsuey is really awesome and very light on the stomach. They really dont use artificial colours or heavy ingredients that make you sick. They were simply delicious. We ordered at 11:30 am and in 20 mins the items reached us( Okay we live 5 mins away).

The surprising part is we loved the food so much that we again ordered 2 dishes today at 3 pm. And again they delivered the order in 15 mins. This time we ordered Veg hakka noodles and Chicken chowmein. My my you wont believe the Chicken Chowmein had a delicious white gravy to go with. Its simply delicious and you guys should really try it out. 

Sorry couldnt post any pictures. My brother and me just ate up the whole thing because it was looking utterly delicious.

I would rate it a 10/5 if I could.. Kudos to Chilli Garlic guys!!!

Review edit: New menu, new prices. Great improvements.

Chicken Celery Supreme- Lovely. Mild, full of flavour, light garlic aroma. Beautiful chicken strips. No extra veggies or celery strips.

Broccoli and Baby Corn in Oyster sauce- This was quit the revelation. Veggies tossed in a sweet and sour oyster sauce. Not too overwhelming.

Steamed Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce- Personally didn't like this. The combination of the mustard with fish is very Bangali and didn't go well with my fried rice. Also, there were too many chillies and the combo of chilli and mustard was too overwhelming.
Tried out the Veg. American Chopsuey, Egg Noodles, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Egg Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken, Sweet and Sour Vegetables and last but not the least, Momos.

The Chopsuey was juicy, delicious and ¬†tasty. The flavour was just awesome, with an especial fragrance of pineapple slices. The crispy chilli baby corn was just delicious. Crispy on the outside, these little babies were quite the revelation.
The Garlic Chicken is one of a kind. Very mild yet very fragrant and full of flavour, the gravy is something I crave for. The chicken pieces are big and soft, with oozing gravy.
The Pan Fried Veg momos are simply delicious, what with their sauce made of garlic bits, Worc sauce drizzled on top. The size is decent, and the filling too. The chicken steamed Momo was a disappointment, though. The chicken filling was not up to the mark.
Their menu boasts of a number of items, at really good prices.
Can't wait to try them all.
Tried out their Chicken Satay and Veg Satay, and was a little disappointed with the chicken one. The veg one was neat, with chunks of vegetables and paneer fried in batter and dripping with chilli garlic oil and sauces. The chicken one was the same in taste but the chicken pieces were below par. They were chewy and tasted bland. Just bland. It was probably an off-day, but I hope I don't get it the next time.The Veg.American Chopsuey has noodles only enough for one person. The gravy with it is awesome, with very less amount of cabbage strips.
