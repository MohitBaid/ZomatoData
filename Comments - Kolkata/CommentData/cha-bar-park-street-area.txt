This place is on the second floor of the Oxford bookstore
The perfect setting to enjoy a book while you refresh yourself.
I ordered a lemon ice tea, it costed 95 bucks but it tasted amazing
Hoping to go back soon.

The food is largely mediocre. They do have quite a few options when it comes to tea. Opens early, sits on top of the Oxford bookstore and is usually quiet enough for a conversation, not to mention the nostalgic pull for many in the city.

One of the best cafe in Kolkata situated above the Oxford book store. Books &  beverages are the main attraction of this place. It was a lovely experience for me &  surely visit this place soon.

Location : It's located right on the first floor of the age old institutional bookstore of Calcutta i . e. Oxford.
Food : So I went here with an aunt of mine to browse and buy a few books from Oxford and our terrible hunger made us end up here. The items that were ordered were Organic Cha, Chocolate Milkshake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (optional) and Celery Chicken Iceberg Club Sandwich.

Organic Cha - was nothing but as we all know masala chai but my aunt said it was pretty good.

Chocolate Milkshake - was unquestionably delicious!! I found this milkshake better than Keventers. It was the right amount of chocolate and milk. It was very chocolaty, creamy and the vanilla ice cream added extra creamy texture to it. I must say out of a few places in the city where you get good milkshakes this has to be one.

Celery chicken iceberg sandwich - Now coming to the sandwich I was very skeptical about the quantity at first. I thought it won't satiate the monstrous hunger of two people. But hey was I wrong!! The sandwich served was actually enough for the two of us. My aunt just loved it. It had celery, poched egg, grilled chicken, mayonnaise and crunchy iceberg lettuce. This sandwich is a star. It came garnished with a handful of french fries and ketchup.

Ambience : How can you expect Oxford to have a sub standard ambience ? It was filled with nerds and bibliophile and people either chatting with their acquaintances or working in their laptop. In short , I liked it . And yes it's pocket friendly too. I had all of this within 400 INR.
This quaint, little cafe has beautifully done interiors with some eye catching quotes and quirky wall arts. I really like the cat on the wall and the blue aquarium.
So, if you haven't yet visited this place you're missing out a lot. Just go to Oxford ( if you happen to be a book lover like me or even if you're not) and grab a bite from Cha Bar's exclusive menu. Adios .

One of the best cafes to be at , right inside a bookstore , cha bar has always been a place to talk and read over coffee. Their menu is an endless list of beverages , mainly tea and they serve food and desserts as well. We had the black currant ice tea and lime and lemon ice tea. The black currant ice tea was really good , it‚Äôs flavour dominating the entire drink. And like and lemon did not taste at all like lime or lemon. It tasted of an overbrewed tea. Hence it did not taste good. The fish and chips and chili cheese toasts are good here. They have a cozy ambience and it‚Äôs lovely to spend time here.

Cha bar is first of it's kind as an urban contemporary cafe, created as an integral part of the iconic Oxford bookstore in Park Street. 

The Cha Bar provides the book lovers with the opportunity of leafing through the pages of their favourite book, over a cup of tea or coffee. 

We ordered Mango milkshakes which were really good, the non veg platter which was okayish and the fish n chips which was also pretty decent. Service was slow. But the ambience was something one would definitely love.

A must visit for all the bibliophiles out there. 

So,
Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4.5/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5

One of the best place for an evening adda with a cup of tea or a tall glass of milkshake! Ambience is unique and lavish. Service totally disappointed me! The items presented on the menu card are partially available. This was a big negativity. My partner and I were unable to eat the things we wanted cause it wasn't available. So, we need to switch it to other options. Management should give this a prior look! Quality of food is very good. It's pocket friendly as well. I would say it is even a place where you can relax after a tiring day with a cup of tea and nibbles with your buddies.

One of my favorite cafes in the city, this is situated above the Oxford Bookstore. It serves some of the best sandwiches and coolers in town. And there's a myriad of flavored coffee and tea to choose from. You should try the classic Hot Chocolate, the dark Kenyan coffee and the milkshakes. My personal favorite is the chicken sandwich with honey mustard sauce.

One of the best places in the town to sit, read and have a sip of coffee or munch over something else. This place have got pretty good ambience, located inside the Oxford Bookstore. Talking about the food, you'll get good quality food here, starting from pizza to parantha rolls, plus a huge huge range of tea. Honestly speaking, still can't get over the masala chai I had there last time. But, the prices are a bit too high, definitely not a place a college student can go regularly to. Lastly, service isn't that impressive, you have to wait for a while to get your food, beverages are being served quickly. If you are a 'chai' lover, you need to check this place out, as the name suggests itself.

The fish and chips is really amazing! I personally loved the flavor of Earl grey. The tea tastes so refreshing! Had my office been located in Park Street, I would have surely made it a point to visit this bar quite often!

What a fall of standard during festive season!!!!!
Presently sitting at cha bar, ordered for a plate 9g Caesars salad, supposed to be served with garlic toast. Salad served sans toast. On asking, gentleman said can provide plain toast. Half an hour over, but no toast yet!!!!
More surprises, the menu mentions a cup of Darjeeling first flush is INR 80. While ordering, we have been informed that these two days, i.e. 24th & 25th December, unofficially the tea rates have been increased to INR 100. 
CHA BAR is has become worse than roadside tea stall or what?????

Well this place turned out to be a major disappointment. Although conveniently located and a good place to spend time with a book or catch up with old friends,but the beverages and the food are best to be avoided. The CCD and Barista just down the road are far better place to shell out your money.
I happened to meet an old friend over a cuppa here a few days back. I ordered the good old Cold coffee with ice cream and my friend ordered Organic Darjeeling tea (after consulting with the waiter). Both were too bland and we had to wait till eternity for our order to arrive. To top that when we asked the waiter to pour the tea,he failed to understand and didn't even bother to pay us any heed further.
Really a bad place to visit. I'll never go again and suggest you same. 
Nothing too fascinating about the decor or ambiance either.

On a Saturday afternoon, me and 3 others went here for a snack after office. Famished, the 4 of us decided to have certain menu items.¬†
As soon as we started ordering, the waiter interrupts and informs that those items are not available currently. We look for other options and yet again, not available.¬†

3 out of 4 sandwiches they have were unavailable , so we switched to pasta. Out of two pastas we ordered, one was served early (wayyy early). And the other took another 30 minutes to cook . So i had to sit there like a fool while others HAD TO¬† start as the food almost ended up being cold. (a lot of awkward waiting was going on here).

The sandwich was not fulfilling , so we ordered another one (that took another 20 minutes).

Don't even get me started on the beverages. We had pre planned to order filter coffee since one of our friends suggested it. Guess what? not available currently. Also none of the warm coffee beverages were available.¬†

The usual masala chai (which is priced 35 on the menu )upon being ordered, we were informed that a cup will cost 100 because only organic tea leaves are available in the kitchen.¬†

Pasta alfredo is supposed to be creamy white. It was orangeish- red in colour and full of salt. I did not complain because I was hungry and after flagging down the waiter 500 times and him ignoring us, i had given up. We did not get additional napkins upon asking, neither did we get water to drink.¬†

We had to flag the waiter down for the bill twice (plus all the times we wanted basically anything). Honestly¬†I expected much better but lesson learnt, never going back there again.

Books and hot beverages make the best couple; and something like this one can experience here. Cha bar cafe is located right inside the Oxford store; the smell of new books and something to munch on with that. Ah ! What an experience.

They have many options in hot beverages, so pick any one and I am sure one will not get disappointed. Visited twice, so was not able to taste too many things. Loved their quiche and fish and chips. Long time have not visited, look forward to visit soon.

Best of luck Team Cha Bar !!

There's nothing quite like reading your favorite book with a lovely aroma of coffee in the air. Located at the first floor of the historic Oxford book store, this stylish coffee shop is where you should be headed if you love to sip your favorite brew while browsing a rich collection of books.

The cafe inside the iconic book store gives people an opportunity to spend more time over a cup of tea , coffee and books. Recenly visited the place and they had a special Halloween theme and their Halloween menu will also be there for a week. As the name suggests, the place has a number of beverages from tea , hot chocolate, mocktails and coffee.  They have a food menu as well. The food is priced fine but the taxes are a bit on the higher side. Wish their taxes were little lesser. The ambience is great though. Only wished they served the pasta in a better way

Nothing special about this place except the decor and ambience.
But then spending a boatload ( they charged service tax even including GST) for that is not really acceptable.
Food quality was bad with the crust of the pizza being as hard as a biscuit.
I wont recommend to visit unless you want to explore the Oxford book store under it.

Location: Beside THE PARK on Park Street.

Unfortunately ham and cheese sandwich wasn't available so i went for a ham cheese n jalapeno sandwich suggested by the friendly staff there. Honestly, i was not disappointed. One plate of sandwich is too much for a single person but as i went there alone i didn't waste even a tiny piece of it. The tea was refreshing and given in a very fancy matter. Overall loved the experience.

It was supposed to be a rest stop on the way to home after a whole day's shopping but it turned out something else when I entered with my boyfriend in the oxford cha bar which is situated just at the  opposite  Street of  Flurrys at park Street...The location is very easy to find and the place is actually a bookstore and a cafe which is like the most gorgeous and attractive combination there can be. 
So coming to the interior part the place is big and well-lit and decorated  and the ground floor was the book store And the first floor was open- walled and there was the cafe.the walls were decorated nicely with pictures of famous people related to Bengali personalities like satyajit ray and many more... There were shelves with cute Mason jars on those... A good sitar composition was playing in the background.everything  was complementing each other very harmoniously... Now the food part which is absolutely fantastic.we ordered lemon iced tea and iced tea with orange gests and a plate of barbequed chicken sausages. As a fan of lemon iced tea i can surely say the quality was good,and the quantity too.(the glass was bigüòä) sausages were well cooked and tangy sweet and soury taste was too good,the meat was tender and not chewy‚ò∫Ô∏è(because I always find them chewy in other placesüò¢) and the service was fast...one drawback was that the sitting Arrangement was small .they should give the cafe a little bit more place compared to the book store.A place worth revisiting . if you want to fold your legs comfortably and want to  have a date with your favourite person and book on a rainy day/a hot summer day/a cold winter evening,this is the place for you

This place is located inside the Oxford book store at Park Street.I fell in love with this place.They have a particular seating arrangement where you can sit and have a great view of the whole book store downstairs.
Now coming to the food.Ordered the Fish and Chips which is served with French fries and a bowl of tartar sauce (which can be refilled).The fish inside is simply soft white and flaky and melts in mouth.The crispy sesame sprinkled outside and soft tasty fish inside makes it a dish worth reordering.
The chicken pasta in cream sauce which came in the sauce pan itself in which it has been cooked and served with a side of toasted bread is simply sinfully yum! It consists of chunky chicken and penne pasta bubbling away in a white creamy sauce.(Don't forget to ask for a spoon because you need to scoop up the yummy sauce)!
Happy Eating guys!

Went there on an evening to have flavoured tea, because it's one of the rare places in the city which serves variety of flavoured tea's. Got a table, chose a tea for me, but it took quite long for the steward to come for the order, probably because it's under-staffed. On ordering the tea, he refused and said it wasn't available, good enough. I chose another flavoured tea, reply came that wasn't available as well, this continued for the third time as well, so tis time i asked him what was available, he answered none of the tea's were available as they were out of stock. Well, ironical is their name Cha Bar, and you don't get tea. Wow. Lastly had to order cappuccino, which was fine enough. But that irony killed everything.

Got to know about this outlet from the app itself, visit  was sudden. Away from usual swag of 'cafes' in city, this outlet was quite different. Surroundings were quite peaceful. Best place to hangout with friends or for business meetings. We ordered :- 

1. Basil Pesto Pasta :- With two pieces of short bread and penne pasta in mixed sauce,  taste was quite good. Taste seems like somebody in home has made it. Quite tempting to eat. Pasta was provided in pan.

2. Veg Hindustan Burger :-   First of all, presentation of this food was fabulous. Burger with french fries and salad was quite delicious and presenting the same in food cart was amazing concept.   

3. Green Japanese Matcha Shake :- Good and worth trying. 

4. Cold coffee with Ice cream :- Had much better. Bit of disappointment.

5. Chocolate Truffle with Ice cream :- Cake was very chocolatey . Very good accompanied with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.

6.Blueberry Muffin :- Another dessert ordered and this also didn't disappointed us at all.

Overall, experience was good. Staff are good and helpful.

They have cultural preparations for tea. I tried South African Rooibos üòä. It tastes best with honey but I like it best with just hot water. It has an enchanting citrus flavour & a hint of vanilla. It was arousing & singular like Nelson Mandela's biography " Long Walk To Freedom".

Tried the mint tea ice crush and barbequed chicken sausages. Food was great and the drink was refreshing and cool.
Enjoyed the visit and will definitely visit again. The staff is friendly and quick. Located above Oxford bookstore, the Cha Bar gives off the vibe of a cosy library. Worth a visit!

I went there along with my friend after a tiring session of book shopping. The top floor of Oxford bookstore is the ideal place for people to while away hours talking about books or anything else. I had a pleasant experience. I ordered Americano coffee and my friend ordered latte. Americano, though a bit strong for my taste, was enjoyable. The prices, given the place and the ambience, are absolutely reasonable.

Being a hardcore chai-addict this is the best place for me to be...i can spend hours here with a book sipping the wide variety of chais they offer....from cardamom , jusmine, cinammone , organic chinese tea....to few other names that are mostly unheard...if you are a chai lover its a must visit.they also offer breakfast, overall a nice cosy place that warms you up with the worlds most popular beverage.

Favourite place for ADDA, in the heart of the city. Got to know via Zomato.
Great crowd, nice music, ambience is the USP. No questions asked on food, it's good all along.
. Comfortable seating arrangements. 
It's a place you can't afford to miss!! 
We ordered walnut cookies, Cha Bar Special Thandai, Lemon infused Ice Tea, Smoky Chicken with Mustard Sandwiches, barbeque sausages, pasta with chicken in white sauce, and the amount without tax was a lil above 500. Will come back for more. #recommended_hugely

We needed a nice comfy place to chit chat, a quiet one with good snacks and not too much punishing for our pockets and we came across this one. This is above the Oxford book store .
Beautiful innovative decor, quiet prompt service and has a small library of its own which mainly has inspirational stories. This will be a favourite place for tea lovers and book lovers. 
 We ordered their special thandai and one lemon iced tea and cookies. Thandai and iced tea were great and perfect with all the right proportional ratios. We further order one chicken and cream cheese pasta which was awesome, not too heavy not to light. And also had a barbecue sausage and smoked Chicken sandwich with mustard sauce. The barbecue sauce could have been better and those two were ok.  
Food : 3.5+
Service and decor : 5 
Will definitely recommend

This place is located jointly with the Oxford book store and at first I mistook this place as a reading area of the bookstore.But basically it acts as the same,you can order a cup of coffee and spend some quality time and by some I mean even 3-4 hours reading books or chatting with your friends.

Coming to the service it is basically just order and receive your food,nothing great.We ordered for some cappuccino and affogato.I like the fact that they provide the sugar seperately because sugar preferences for coffee is different for different person,but being a place specialising in tea and coffee,not providing brown sugar with coffee was a big negative for me.I ordered the affogato which was perfect for me,strong dark Espresso with a bit of vanilla ice cream.The pricing is cheap both for the food and drinks.

The experience was quite ordinary for us but seeing a chaotic situation of another regular customer of this place it was quite evident that the management is not much considerate about customer's feedback.

Cha Bar is my go to place for tea and snacks whenever I am in the Park Street Area. Their large collection of teas is always an attraction and they serve really delicious snacks as well. Pick up a book, order some food and time will fly by. And have I mentioned that the ambiance is really comforting? It is also an ideal place for a nice quiet date. Head to Cha Bar today to have a great time.

A cafe inside a bookstore! That too an Oxford Bookstore. 
Ordered Barbecued Chicken Sausages, Chicken and cream sauce pasta and Ice cream with chocolate truffle. 
Service is a bit slow, but I was engrossed with my friends and realised that later. 
The Chocolate truffle was too good. 
But the pasta was not that much good. 
Food-4/5.
Ambience-5/5.
Service-3.5/5.

Sad that this place has changed a lot...It got enhanced externally, more places to sit, for casual parlance...but the service is degrading day by day.
The tea provided here are awesome but most of the food items are not available. I found a group sitting next to me asked to vacate the tables as other guests waiting...This is not quite becoming as the difference between a restaurant and cha bar lies in that only that people frequent here for chitchat, not just to have food
Staffs were much better previously and the place actually exuded the essence of Park Street whereas now they are ill-accented people lacking refinement

LATEST VISIT REVIEW 

One of the most dishonest place in the business right now. Once I frequented this establishment but today was after a long time. To see the familiar faces gone and new faces be ignorant of giving service to the customers just disheartened me. 

They are charging 10% Service Charge apart from the 5% GST, which they try to justify by saying that it is written in the menu. That is dishonesty at its lowest. And not only that, they took the price of two Organic Tea (Rs 100 each) instead of the actual order, which was two Masala Tea ( Rs 35 each). They rely heavily on the forgetfulness and trusting nature of the customers. Our eyes did catch the SERVICE CHARGE but somehow missed the duping of Rs 130 through this dishonest way. 

Management, reply to this and not with some regurgitating bullshit but an actual answer. I do have the receipt and I have written a complaint too under the name of A.Roy. 




#Previous thought#

For all those who enjoy a calm and quiet atmosphere with soft music playing on the background while sipping down some iced tea, this is the heaven. Situated in the Oxford bookstore and moonlighting at times as a place for poetry readings, this place has garnered quite the buzz lately and deservedly so. Be it a reprieve amidst the scoring summer with an ice cold mint tea ice crush or having oolong tea during the winter, Cha Bar is the name on the tip of the tongue for people who are visiting this vicinity.

Last we went there, I ordered a Lime and Lemon Zest Iced Tea(the picture might be of the peach or something else...I can't remember since I've been here a few times and have had all the variations of iced tea to keep track of which one is which, but trust me, mint is the best one...just after the mint iced tea crush), Non-Veg assortment platter or the platter with Seekh Kebab and Fish n Chips(no mistake can be done here..It's that good). The kebabs were succulent and although not as good as actual kebab joints can offer, this is one that doesn't disappoint. It was decent. But the Fish n chips, although a bit costly, is impeccable here.

The decor here is a real treat to the eyes and with a setting suitable for some light reading or even a romantic date, one won't even understand how the time flows by.

A neat place inside Oxford Book Shop on Park Street. This is cozy informal kind of tea house on the mezzanine floor of the book store. The decor and ambience is awesome, with elements of tradition and modernity meshing together seamlessly. There are a wide variety of teas available, in fact one is spoilt for choice, it also becomes a little difficult to choose, which one to have. I think I'll go back again and again to sip on the different teas available here!!üòÇ
They serve the tea with all the paraphernalia, the teapot, sugar pot, tea cup and strainer...old school. Nice touch. Some snacks, nibbles and sandwiches are there to be had with the tea.Also there are teacakes and pastries. One can sit here read a book and have a cuppa or just relax and sip a cup.
Friendly servers, great ambience and reasonably priced. Solace to visit again and again.

"Cha Bar" is the only cafe which has gotten a 5.0 rating from me. That speaks volumes about the kind of food and service that I have gotten from this cafe. This cafe is located in the first floor of Oxford book store and this has increased the attractiveness of the cafe to a large extent.

I have already been here two times. On my last visit, I went for one "mango milkshake" first . It was great . It was not too strong but mild and delicious.

Up next,I went for "Fish and Chips" . This "Fish and Chips" can easily be regarded as the best one in Calcutta. The fish was filled with fish fillet and went well with the mayonnaise. It was delicious and filling.

Finally, I went for "Chicken pasta in cream sauce". This pasta is the best ever. The cubed chicken pieces in the pasta were well marinated and created magic with the cream sauce. It was beyond amazing.

The staff was well-behaved and amiable and I will definitely go here again.

Cha bar has a wonderful ambiance, the fact that it is right above Oxford book store makes it even better. Cha bar boasts of variety of tea and coffee though all of them aren't available always.
My personal  favourite is the cha bar blend and masala cha. They even have an array of snacks to offer. I always go for the basket of fries and chilli chicken wrap. They even have different pastries but it's not always fresh.
You can drop in here if your in the area, you won't have a bad experience.

I have been here quite a few times. Its a great place to have a long chat with flavoured aromatic teas and delicious snacks. The decor is mindboggling and very unique which is the major attraction for the visitors. It is a comfortable place yet classy. Service is pretty good. Prices are affordable and food is worth the money. I have had their 'fish n chips' which was mouth watering. I love the plating and the antique containers in which they serve food and beverages. The chocolate truffle is my personal favourite. Apart from these, grilled sandwiches, muffins and all kinds of tea are the must haves. This place can never disappoint u for sure. Must visit at least once.

I was so excited when I entered Cha Bar....but when i saw flies all over and such poor maintenance half of my excitement went away... finally I ordered one Veg Pesto Pasta I can't believe someone could even make such a pasta, it was awful. I complained about the taste and asked for a replacement the waiter was so rude instead of accepting their fault they were like you have to pay for it. I even ordered for "organic masala tea" and that was pathetic. I paid for not having anything! Worst Experience till date. I personally would not recommend anyone to visit this place.

Spend hours over passion fruit ice tea, blue berry muffin, pasta with cream and chicken, sausages, organic masala tea, chocolate milk shake (my most favorite) and fries... These are our favourites. The staff is really polite and courteous. They literally remember our favourites!

I come here to have desserts and cha after I have lunch somewhere in Park street. There is huge variety but not all of them are good. In desserts, the chocolate truffle cake and the blueberry muffin are the best. They source it from Flurys or Park,so quality is assured. The nice chilled out ambience works.

Worst! Went there today to chill out with a friend. They took a.lot of time to order. The waiter was very much rude and arrogant. We ordered lemon ice tea with honey and chicken sausages. Ice tea was worst and the sausages seemed to be stale. In addition there was this rude behaviour by the waiter. Never shall I visit there and I would never recommend it to my acquaintances.

Housed inside the Oxford Bookstore, this is the perfect place to nestle up with a cup of the golden brew, while flipping through your new book. And the walls are lovely, with tea-trivia strewn around. I am particularly fond of their Chilli-Chicken Wrap and the Cheese Chilli Toast. I love Cha Bar for its walls, its location and for the smell of new books in the air.

P.S. It‚Äôs a pity that books cannot be taken to the tables of the Cha Bar unless one has purchased it.

Second visit:
I ordered a 80rs Hot Chocolate. The description said it would be dense and creamy. Even a roadside stall sells better quality beverage. Moreover they take service charge 10% n then GST.
It just changed my impression about the place.
They didn't even have the decency to apologise or make amends after we complained.
First visit:
The ambience of this well spaced cafe just above the Oxford bookstore is ideal for a nice tea/coffee with a friend or some alone time with your favourite book.
They have lots of options for tea and coffee and there is a display of desserts and savoury at the counter.
We had a
Vanilla tea, which I liked cuz it was tea n it was vanilla.
A cold coffee, creamy enough.
And a rich chocolate truffle pastry.
The last time we visited.

Calm, peaceful place if you wana nibble while going through the bestseller books. Located on the first floor of Oxford bookstore in park street. Dint expect that there would be anything more then finger foods and chai, but surprisingly there is a good amount of food. I am a hard core foodie, so I dont believe in just a coffee and conversations. So I had to eat more then read or talk. Out of all the things mentioned in the menu we had green apple soda, pink lemonade, white sauce pasta, french fries and fried fish, non veg finger food. Everything was decent except fish fry which was amazingly soft inside and extremely hard outside. Oh and probably people just wana drink tea and read at such places, the table were small too for my likes. So dont land up ordering more then what fits your table. üòÇ

Though these days oxford's selection of books is not what it was once... But the cha bar remains the same.... I have spent lazy afternoons, frantic evenings here mulling over which books to buy while sipping a cuppa from their extensive collection of tea... Never really tasted their coffee.... My favourite remains the Darjeeling first flush. But yesterday I went with a friend and being one of the hottest days we decided to sip iced tea instead.... The peach ice tea was so much better then the normal lemon iced tea that I had!!! Mine was much too sweet for my taste.... However the mahogany bench overlooking the hallowed hall of OBS and engaging company compensated amply!!!

I have been in Oxford Bookstore many times but was never hungry before and didn't try cha bar.
Having some free time and being hungry, i visited today.
Ordered Darjeeling Green Tea and a Celery, Chicken and Iceberg Club.
Service is slow, but I was engrossed in my book and realised that later.
The sandwich was tasty and filling.
The tea was flavour full. 
Will be trying more of them next time I visit.

This place can be called the modern version of the legendary Coffee House of Kolkata. It is a great place to read your book peacefully, to chat with your friends, to just sit alone and sip your tea. The variety of teas that they offer is wide-ranging, from masala chai to oolong tea to cold teas. If you are a coffee person then there are some options for you too but I will suggest you to go for tea. The food is average, the muffins and pastries are not something to look out for. I really liked the cardamom masala chai and the raspberry cold tea.

The decor is very stylish, urbane and thoughtful. The view of the bookstore from atop, the wall graffiti, the mixed smell of a hot masala chai and the newly bought books made me enjoy the place a lot.

I have visited this place almost 2 times now, and I must say that this is the cosiest place I have been to. Moreover this place gives me a good feeling as well, including the Oxford Rizzato Music, and the nice ambience. The employees give the feeling of bouncers, and they do look tough, as if they all are gymming a lot. One person nearly got scared due to this. The food (veg stuff only fro me pls) is okay, and the only thing I liked was the chilli cheese toast, which was priced at 109+taxes. It came to around 150 for one toast, which made me think if I need to earn even higher (way higher) to afford a toast, cause the tax was around 30%. I give it 4.0 rating.

We visited the famous Cha Bar in Park Street today late evening for chai and snacks. This was my first visit here apart from the oxford store visits to buy books which I have done a lot many times.
What shocks me here is that after all good food, ambiance and service, we were given a bill amount where we were charged service tax twice (namely service charge 10% and service tax 6%) and VAT 14.5%. And all of these did not have a registered fifteen digit code of service Tax number printed on the bill. We were worried and scared to pay the bill as there were no registered Tax number printed. When asked, they went back and changed the bill and gave us a food discount of 10% on the same bill. We still did not pay the bill as it is illegal and the waiter went away to make another fresh bill. After waiting for fifteen more minutes we went up to the cash counter as it was geting late and oxford bookstore was closing already. We met the manager there who spoke to us in a very rude manner and denied to accept any such rule of providing us proper proofs of charging service tax along with service charge and a VAT. After a discussion of half and hour more he called up somebody ( probably the owner of the place) who asked him to provide us the correct bill. Then the Manager gave us another bill where the service tax registered number was mentioned. We realised he has removed the 10% service charge that he was charging us in the initial bills. Ashamed and embarrased he did not speak to us properly, not even apologised and directly left the place before us. We wasted our one hour discussing these matters with all the staff there and it is so tragic that none of them seemed to be aware of providing the correct bills to the consumers. (Pictures of both my bills are attached)
As per rule 4A of Service Tax rules 1994, it is mandatory to mention the registration number in the invoice copy to be able to be viewed by the person paying the service tax.
Many restaurants are misusing the fact that service taxes are unavoidable and has to be paid but what we do not know is that, it is an optional thing and we can deny to pay it.
Many restaurants may tell you that they have applied for it and waiting for the number but you should always ask for the proof for that.
Kindly be more aware of such situations and check your bill for the correct registration number when you visit here.

Good for sitting and chilling out with friends. We had lemon ginger tea, another milk tea and one hot chocolate. Tea was served in a kettle and more than enough for two persons though they give one cup for one tea.
Hot chocolate was good but not outstanding. It was very sweet according to my taste buds. 
Ambience and service were nice.

Need some peace? Trust me this is the best place for you then! Had been eyeing this place for a long time and finally got time today evening to visit this lovely place. Ordered one spiced cappuchino and enjoyed it alone in peace without pressurizing my pocket. Just 65 bucks including all taxes. After having my coffee and some peaceful time came back again an hour later with my friend as he wanted to visit this place again. He orderd on thadai and cookies and i went for cappuchino (coffee addiction) 0.5 deducted for higher tax charge. They charge 30.5% tax which is higher than normal tax charges. But peace comes with a price nowadays üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Must visit. Beverages are really low priced. Best place to find time for yourself. Must visit. Recommended!

Not so much of a place that promises delicacies worth returning. But the things that I loved about this place stems from its situation over the bookstore I fell in love with. You could choose one particular text to accompany you while you sip gently in your coffee. Library-cum-caf√©, so why do you wanna know more? Just grab yourself a good book to go along and dabble into the beverages.

The ambience of this place is one of a kind. Situated over the Oxford bookstore, it is the perfect cafe for a book-worm to sit and have a long adda session.
    Cha Bar lives up to it's name by being the place with the most extensive variety of tea that I have visited till date. Being a caffeine addict I stuck to my cup of Americano, while my friend ordered the Kashmiri Kahwah ,recommended by the staff. It was served beautifully accompanied by almond and honey and a strong aroma of tea and spices hit us as soon as we opened the kettle. It tasted as good as it smelled.
     We  also had fish and chips. The fish was soft and juicy and the chips were crisp and well-made.

Been here quite a lot of times.
I love the ambience and since its located right on the floor above oxford, it acts as a real feel good factor for me.
Now coming to the food.

1) Fish and chips : It is surely one of the best fish and chips i have tried. And one of my all time favorites.
Its served with a usual tartar sauce and is perfectly done. Quantity is share-able.
2) Ice teas : They have a variety of falavoured iced teas. Like peach, passion fruit, lime and lemon zest, strawberry. And most of them taste really good.
3) Non veg platter : This one is simple yet quite filling. Consists of a variety of chicken sausages and sandwiches. 
4) Hot chocolate : Not the best, but its good enough for satisfying your sudden bursts of craving for hot chocolate.

The variety of teas this place offers is amazing. Being a tea lover, it's a pleasure to visit this place. The interior and decor is beautiful! An amazing place to spend some quality time either alone, or with a close one. The ambience that this place offers is much better than the food. The teas are amazing, the food not so much. Order an ice tea or any tea and spend some quaint time at this place. My personal favorite is the Mint Ice Tea -  It is really refreshing and unlike a lot of places, they don't sweeten it, so the mint flavor is intact.

Had heard a lot about this place. Ambience was good, with Oxford university book store down stairs. Also the interior. 
It's my first visit to Cha Bar. And I ordered Masala Chai, Iced coffee and chocolate cupcakes. 
Going with the name I expected some awesome flavour in the masala chai to give a good kick. But to my disappointment. it turned out to be less kadak!! Same goes to the iced coffee. Too watery. I changed both to get something better. But didn't made much difference in the second preparation too. 

I liked the cup cake. They cut it, and added hot chocolate sauce into it. 
But not a right place for me to have some kicking Chai !!

A much frequented place in my years of youth. Many a quick date has convened here :)¬†

The hot chocolate was a poorer version of drinking chocolate. But I loved the red berries chai, the mixed fruit ice tea and masala chai. It‚Äôs clear where the expertise lies :) Our chosen snacks ‚Äì bun maska & bun tikki were most satisfying. The chocolate truffle ‚Äì the reason I came here in the first place after nearly a decade ‚Äì still packs a mean punch. It‚Äôs just the most crumbly, warm, delicious chocolate cake I‚Äôve ever had. That‚Äôs one knockout recipe, given its consistency over the years and locations. The poor service can leave you frustrated but good luck resisting the food & beverages. Pure nostalgia for me.

Went to this cafe twice. It is inside the Oxford bookstore, so, bookworms, a very good choice for you. You can have a coffee after reading a book, or have a chat over coffee. The ambience... well, to a book lover like me, the smell and the sight of books all around is enough. And there is some awesome witty decor, with some really fun facts.

Let's get to the food.
First time, we had a Spiced Cappuccino and a Lime and lemon zest iced tea.
Suggestions about the idea of the Spiced Cappuccino‚Äï Don't. Horrible idea. Tea is not coffee. Cardamom may go well with tea, but NOT with coffee.
The line and lemon zest was AWESOME! Personally,I am a big fan of iced tea, and am disappointed repeatedly because I get 'lemonade' instead of iced tea. This was one of the most perfect iced tea I've ever had. You get the sour taste in your mouth at first‚Äï the lemony "zest", and then, it slowly fades and the flavour of the tea remains in your mouth. And it is some really, really good flavoured tea.
Edit after another time- Order at your own risk, for there is a chance of messing it up badly‚Äï by which it was turned into an ultra sour lemonade. (Want the taste? Squeeze two limes in cold water, and voila!)

The second time, we ordered Americano, Affogato, Iced caffe latte and fish and chips.
The Americano is very strong here. And the coffee is of top grade. You get the perfect kick that you are supposed to get from an Americano.
The Affogato, for those who don't know, is a scoop of vanilla ice cream in coffee. The ice cream slowly melts, imparting the flavour in coffee. And you enjoy the flavour of vanilla in coffee. It was my first time trying it, and I was blown away by the taste.
They serve the Iced caffe latte in a very tall glass, about a foot long. And it is THE best cold coffee I've tasted.
The Fish and Chips was recommended by the staff. And boy! We didn't regret accepting the suggestion. A crusty exterior with a soft juicy interior of fresh fish, it was awesome. And there was such a huge quantity! The fries were also well made.

The cafe offers a good platter at a very cheap ra
te. You will be surprised at the quantity you get at such a rate. And the coffee is one of the best in Kolkata.
Bookworms, go to the store, enjoy a book and a cup of coffee. Coffee lovers, if you don't enjoy reading, visit here just for the coffee. It is a must visit for all, to enjoy the food and have a good chat.

What a pleasant discovery this has been. Cha Bar is a beautiful cafe located in the Oxford store at Park Street. It's so convenient to just pick up a book and head out to the cafe area, drink your favorite cuppa tea/coffee while reading your favorite book! And what a great ambience! They have a huge variety of tea choices- by far the most I've come across. I would've given this place a 5/5 but none of the coffee products were available at the cafe on this particular day and also the service was really slow!

This is a cute little space for hanging out with a couple of friends or for taking a perfect break. It is present just above the Oxford Book Store at parkstreet area. 
The wall decorations and the smell of books all round is really pleasant for the ones who are book lovers. Here you get to taste varities of tea. Though there is even options for coffee, mocktails or shakes. 
Veg or Non-veg all types of foods are available here . Though options vary from sandwiches to sausages or pizzas. It's more or less like a small cafe.
It is really very cheap yet a beautiful cafe. We took one line soda, one blue lagoon and a plate of chicken sausage...and the total bill was Rs 326 only inclusive of tax. 
Hence you can try out once here if you think your pocket money is less yet you want to taste parkstreet flavour üòú

Located just above the OXFORD Book store, there is this pleasant tea place the CHA BAR. You need to pass through the Oxford Book Store to visit this place.
A complete treat for book lovers, there's books all around you. A quite place perfect for official meetings or for speaking  your heart out to your best friend. The place is also perfect for lone visits, I am sure none will get bored even when visiting without any company. 
Coming to the food, I didn't try much. I has a cup of hot chocolate, and it tasted good like at any other normal place, nothing special about it. The serving the very basic in a transparent glass cup with a stainless spoon, nothing fancy about it.
If someone's looking for good food, there are other better places in Park Street area, but if a book lover is looking for a place to spend time, this is a perfect place for them.

Note: The time of serving is a bit on the slower side thou n yeah, doesn't have a proper washroom.

Located at the buzzing spot of Park Street. Right above the oxford bookstore is cha bar. I had much expectation from this famous cafeteria. 
The ambiance is really nice and catchy. The books, the small articles such as a teapot,paintings etc.add up to a different notion. You can grab a book and read it while you wait for your cup of coffee or a cupcake. 
Coming to the food, the food is really a turn down. First of all the items weren't available, whatever we were asking weren't available. So had to order something else. We ordered a classic tea chicken English club sandwich, chilli garlic toast and cappuccino. We waited for around 30 minutes and the staffs were pretty arrogant and ignorant too. Never mind they must not be getting paid enough I guess!  The plates were unclean, it had stains. The sandwich was average in taste. Then the toast was really bad! It hardly had any cheese on it, the cheese was just grated and topped with some chilli flakes and that was their cheese chilly toast. The breads were so hard that they seemed to be stale. The coffee? The cappuccino was made of 3/4 of water and only 1/4 of milk. It was so bland in taste. 
I'll never go back there and not let my friends go there even.poor experience. The 0.5 extra is given for the ambiance. 
Thanks.

I had always wanted to visit this place every time I visit Oxford Bookstores in Park Street. Finally I did. I love the decor of this place. It's very cute, cozy and you can actually read a book, apart from the usual "eat,drink,chat" which is their tagline. The food was really good. We ordered the following things:
1) Masala Chai (milk tea infused with spices.)
2) Blueberry muffin (This was itself very delicious. The muffin was served warm and it went perfectly with the tea. Next time I might pack a few muffins to carry back home. It's highly recommended.)
3) Chocolate Truffle Cake (A chocolate pastry with its layers slightly separated and over those layers delicious chocolate sauce was poured. I would've preferred it a bit warm too.)

However, there were a couple of things that went wrong. Firstly, I went to visit Cha bar at 10.15 am because I read on Zomato that the place opens at 9.30. But it was still closed for at least for another 1 hour and I had to wait outside the bookstore for it to open. Secondly, the service was really slow. When I went in, me and my friend were the only people at the Cha bar but still the food was served at least 40 mins after placing the order. We were really hungry and it was morning but we ended up having a brunch and not a breakfast. Slow service really put us off. We are definitely gonna visit the "bar" soon hoping for a far better service as is expected of them. 

Oxford bookstore is one of my favourite places in the city. Wouldn't want that to change. #bookworm

Stopped over for good old Darjeeling tea here but was hugely disappointed. Ordered two Makaibari and one Queen's choice and all three were equally bland and lifeless and had zero aroma. It was standard road side tea boiled in hot water for which they were charging RS. 80/- + taxes per cup? I regularly have Makaibari tea and fully know how great the flavor and aroma is. I have been to cha bar many times before over the years but what happened today was unthinkable. I did ask at the counter but got zero response. These people are masquerading as tea connoisseurs but flinching off people big time. I really felt cheated.

Nothing, really. Love this place. With Satyajit Ray's picture on the wall and Oxford's magic this place is truly a book lover's den. The service is quite fast and they have a lot of options in the cupcakes and a hell lot of versatile Teas flavours! Just one suggestion, skip their coffee. They aren't quite good with that.

On top of oxford book store, reachable over a staircase at the back of the book store. Nice and simple with pleasantly slow service, customets are left to fend for themselves. The well trained underarms of one waiter makes you think that he soends more time training than actually carrying drinks or food to tables. In case you need to read the first pages of a new book certainly the perfect place. Some quiet, a dead cheap drink, you will probably hit page 25 before it ever arrives.. nice decorative pueces thought the place is a bit soulless due to its odd long and thin shape.

Best place for a hangout or meetup with your friends over a cup of coffee. I frequently use to visit this place for having a business meeting with someone. Price is very reasonable. My heart wants to give a rating of 5 but this cafe needs to bring more varieties in their menu. Perfect place, perfect spot in the heart of City of Joy! Must visit if you are willing to have some important chitchat with your colleagues over a cup of coffee!

Now my heart wants to give this place more rate than I have given but my last 2 visits to this place does not let me give anything more than this. I am visiting this place since 1998 , since my alliance francaise days. I have often finished an entire book here in a few sittings, met friends ... Chatted over one cup of tea for hours. I simply loved the name 'cha bar' . This time when I visited the place I had to politely request several times to get the table cleaned after the previous occupants had left. Well , given the rush I did not have a choice but sit there as I did not want to lose the place. I still love the Darjeeling there. I almost gave up hope on the snack , and was about to leave when it finally reached my table. I am not sure what is wrong with the city or the people , why does everything take its sweet time and will & does not respect other's time.

Have been looking forward to visit this place from quite some time now, and I finally got the opportunity yesterday to spend a sorted Christmas Eve with a bunch of friends.
The location, the season of festivity, the ambience, the food and soothing light music... Cha bar has tucked in a special place inside my heart :)
My experience was very good, will be looking forward to visit again.

Really like the concept of having tea while reading a book. The name is very catchy and so was the ambience. While a soft music is being playing in the background, one can enjoy both the book and food. I went in with my friends today and we were very delighted at the variety of teas available here. The service was very slow but overall it was an amazing experience. The food was delicious.

I have never had such bad cold coffee in my life.. I think with this kind of bad food, I am scarred for life! I don't know which was worse, the sandwich, the sausage, or the cold coffee! And most of the items on the menu card won't be available.. seriously the breads in the sandwich were stale and what not! Never coming back!!

This place was a saviour for me when I found myself alone for an evening in the city. Went hunting for places I wouldn't be looked down upon for sitting alone, and there it was, humbly inviting me upstairs. There's an Oxford bookstore as well so all you need to do is take the smell of your favourite tea as well the books. The staff is very courteous and the ambience is pleasant. Had a chamomile tea and an apple-raisin muffin. And both were delightful.

This place is one of D hidden gems in town. If someone wants to read books while having tea. I must say this place provides the best ambience. Awesome concept. Cha bar is located on the 1st floor of oxford. For a book lover this place is like heaven. We had masala tea along with chocolate muffin cake.Ambience wise 100 out of 10. Service was quick. The closing time, written in zomato is 9.30 but that store cum cafe close at 9 p.m.

As a book lover, this is one of my favorite place in Kolkata. I can spent here lots of time with a book and a cup of coffee. The cha bar menu is awsm and favorable for tea lovers for their variations from all over India. The food quality is awsm and price is low. Ambience and interior is remarkable.

Located in Park Street and inside Oxford bookstore, you would expect it to be elite or something, but it isn't that extravagant and unreachable a place really. Just a quiet corner to have a peaceful conversation with friends, or revel in your own personal bubble with a book in hand, Cha Bar is the perfect place. Nothing beats the feeling of reading a book with a steaming cup of coffee or tea of thousand varieties, and Cha Bar provides just that. There are also options like sandwiches, pastries, truffles, fries, milkshakes, pastas, burgers, toasties, and sherbets to choose from, all ranging from 60 to 120 bucks, plus taxes. Another budget friendly place, Cha Bar is great for experimenting with tea, with the added option of flipping through some pages, with friends or by yourself, in a beautiful atmosphere, without putting a hole in your pocket.

The only problem with this place is that it pretends to be too good. ¬†And why shouldn't it be, it is present at a pompous location as well. Located on the 1st floor of the highly prestigious Oxford Bookstore, it shells out good (but nothing out of the ordinary) dishes. The decor is fantastic, and it amalgamates the "eat while you sit, and sit while you read" sentiment very well. There are a lot of quirky design elements and showcases adorned with teapots.¬†

Coming to the food: we ordered Fish & Chips, Smoked Chicken and Mustard Sandwich, Chocolate Chip Muffins, two teas: an Irish and an English one, and a Non Veg Platter. ¬†
The Fish and Chips were just average. The fish did not have that fresh smell. The chips were good, but the white sauce that came with it (Tartare?) destroyed the palate with its unpleasant combination. The non veg platter was good, but the quantity was a bit less. The teas tasted good, and they gave generous quantities of the brew. The muffins were a bad deal. They looked juicy, but were blander than a Mio Amore chocolate cake. I've never had such bad muffins. I liked the sandwich though, it smelled just right and was savoury enough for me to want more.¬†

This place would have deserved a 3.5/5 rating, but there were two flies constantly buzzing around the food, and while we were eating, two more joined in to increase the chaos. Flies aren't a deal breaker, but they just impart a unhygienic look to the place, which it's not.

I edited the review from a 3.5/5 to a 3/5 rating because the establishment is supposed to have wi-fi as mentioned by Zomato, but it didn't. Either don't spread misinformation or start offering WiFi.

Had gone here with a couple of friends having heard it's reputation as a place serving authentic British food. The ambience is decent but the hygiene is not, there too many flies were buzzing around our place and it got plain irritating at times.

As for the food, the fish and chips were pretty good but I found nothing special in either the chicken grilled sandwich or the Earl Grey Tea. Overall, a decent place but not one that I would like to come again.

A really lovely place to sit and relax. It's hidden inside a book store which adds to the charm of the place. The menu is quite elaborate with numerous variations of tea and coffee. The food menu, on the other hand is short and simple. We had Espresso, Fruit Tea Cake and a Blueberry Muffin. Nothing to complain about. Though the service is a bit slow. Easy on the pocket too. It's a must visit for a book-lover.

Oxford Bookstore, Park Street has a very special space in my heart. It was the first bookstore I visited where I can actually browse through the collection and read few pages of a book before deciding whether to buy it. When we were young the luxury of doing so was only available with the second hand book shops. Later I also used to buy diaries and handmade paper notebooks from them. When, around 2000, they introduced the Cha Bar inside the bookstore, it became yet another reason to visit the place. So, when I got an invitation from them to attend Flavothon, a bloggers meet to try out their newly launched menu, it was a great moment for me.
                                                                ...

The sandwiches are good. The coffee is decent. All in all, it is a great place to hang out in.

Cha bar is just above oxford book store . It serves quite a few different variety of tea. And the taste of the beverages are really good. You can go to cha bar pick up a book from oxford sit there and read for hours sipping you Darjeeling tea. If you love your own company go there to enjoy with yourself and a good read.

Cha bar is one of the signature places in park street area. I went there on a Sunday evening. It is actually a bookstore of Oxford and on the first floor there is a cafeteria that offers snacks kind of food.
Cha bar is an ideal place to chit-chat with friends without any hassle. You can just munch on foods, sip tea and keep on taking. The ambience of the place is very undisturbed and peaceful. 

We ordered: cold coffee with ice cream,  cold coffee, non-vegetarian snack platter, wok tossed chicken sausages, fish and chips.

Cold coffee was awesome in taste and the quantity was huge at such a cheap price!! This cold coffee really impressed me a lot!
In non vegetarian snack platter there were three kinds of fries. Crunchy and tasty.. loved it. 
Chicken sausages tossed in sauce was decent in taste.
Fish and chips were 3 pieces of deep fried, crispy fish fillets with potato wedges and mayonnaise. It really was the winner of that evening. 

We enjoyed our food so much. That was a perfect sunday evening we spent at cha bar. The price of the food was also very reasonable. They do charge extra taxes. This place is very well maintained and decorated with books, coffee mugs, musical instruments. A great place for book lovers, and also for those who are in search of a calm, soothing and quiet place to spend quality time with loved ones, friends or maybe with themselves...........

Location-oxford book store,Kolkata.

This place is a small cafeteria at the 1st floor of the oxford book store.As the name suggests"Cha bar"it mainly deals in tea and we were stunned after seeing the variety of tea they serve.Along side they also serve other beverages,Snacks and dessert.They have quite  large seating capicity and also had a separate place (sort of library) to read books in the cafeteria.

Service-The service at this place was quite laggard but the staff was too cooperative and maintains the place very well.

Ambiance-The ambiance was the plus point of this cafeteria.It was extremely calm and soothing and the place has been exactly decorated in accordance with its name.Some music will always be played at the place at a very low volume which goes very well with the place.

Food-The food was quite good.But one thing that disappointed us was that they had extreme variety of tea in menu but when we ordered we saw that most of them were unavailable.We had-
1:Masala chai
2:Pudina chutney and cheese sandwhich
3:Apple pie

If anybody wanted to combine their preference of books with decent tea and sandwiches Cha Bar is probably one of the best of option in Kolkata. Located in the heart of the city and that too under the umbrella of Oxford bookstore I have visited the place several times before and quite liked their previous offerings. Last week I have re-visited Cha Bar to taste offerings from ¬†their new menu and ended on having Smoked chicken and Mustard Sandwich, Chili Chicken Wrap, Barbequed¬†Chicken Sausages, Bun Kebab and Bun Omelette, Chili cheese¬†toast and club sandwich ¬†along with the iced tea . As we were part of a group, we ended on the "sharing is caring" mode. Coming to the food offered, I found both Smoked chicken and Mustard Sandwich, Chili Chicken Wrap good though the later¬†can opt for a name change (it was not having the typical flavor of chili chicken but there was no compromise on taste). ¬†Barbequed Chicken Sausages were decent and Bun Kebab and Bun Omelette were basically Chicken and Egg Burger respectively and taste good.

Looking at there great rating on zomato and huge advertisement ¬†outside the oxford book store so entered this place. Was handed with a menu card which never ends with the beverage drink and last 4 pages for eateries. On ordering got to know many of the tea are not available and only selected one is present apart from this when ordered order bun maska got to know they have only tit bits, sandwich ,pasta and no bakary or other items present. Fine so ended ordering masala chai and sandwich . After 15 minutes of wait came to know bread is not available so just had tea. which again i had to wait for 15 min .No books are allowed to read unless you buy them . Overall worst experience ¬† .

My friend and I decided to drop in here after lunch. A good decision I tell you. Everything here is very nice- The ambience, the staff and the food. We ordered a Lemon Ice Tea  , Lemonade and  a choco chip muffin. The choco chip muffin was light and fluffy with lots of yummy chocolate chips in it. The lemonade was nice and chilled , but I have tasted better versions. The lemon ice tea too was good. The muffin was big and the drinks  came in nice tall glasses. The bill, including Service Tax, VAT and Service Charge came to 274 Rs. which is decent. 

Try it for the wonderful atmosphere and the smell of tea and good books üëç

Ten on ten if you ask me about the ambiance.
Perfect location.
Perfect seating arrangement.
You will always find a fresh flower on your table.
The smell of new books and good food will certainly make your day.
The lighting is perfect, bright.
The music, the volume is just perfect and you will for sure find one of your favorite songs in their playlist.
This is the place that I used to visit when I would be upset, instantly uplifts your mood.
They have a long list of teas in their menu, but sadly I am not a tea lover so haven't tried any yet.
I love the muffins and cookies. The smell is enough to bring that wide smile on my face.
The price is alright taking into consideration the ambiance and the service.
You can sit there for hours reading books without any disturbance and have your favorite food.

A must try if you are in Kolkata and haven't been to this place yet.

Went to this place last sunday to spend some 'me' time with my book and some good food. 

The ambience is perfect! I love the decor and it's really appealing! The ingenious designing is bright and uplifting. 
Coming to the food, I had tried out quite a few things, after all I spent around 5 hours sitting there and reading my book.

Pink Lemonade - this was a very refreshing drink and a perfect way to start a long meal and a book reading journey. The lemon and had a perfect balance of sweetness and sourness.

Fish n Chips - This was the main dish for which I had planned this outing apart from the book reading. The fish was cooked to perfection and more over the potato wedges were absolutely delicious! I love the potatoes more than the fish! (And that is same something considering that I love fish from the bottom of my heart) Moreover the pricing of the dish is highly reasonable and no wonder it is highly acclaimed by most of the people in their reviews.

Raspberry Iced Tea- This was another cracking drink. The taste was somewhat similar to the Pink Lemonade but that didn't bother me as it was amazing! 

Chicken and Asparagus Quiche- This was an okay dish. The pastry was soggy but the filling was good. As a whole it was just fine and not something I'd remember. 

Ham and Cheese Sandwich - This was a good sandwich! The bread was well grilled. However I somehow couldn't taste the filling as all I could find in my mouth was bread! I could see the filling but couldn't taste it! Still I liked the sandwich and that's what matters. 

Chocolate Truffle Pastry - This was a perfect ending to a filling meal! I loved the pastry to bits and pieces! It was full of chocolate and it was warm and melting in my mouth! Absolutely loved it! 

The staff is quite courteous and the service is decently paced. No complaints in that department! 

As a whole, I had a lovely experience and it was a Sunday well spent! 

The place is recommended to all who would like to just sit down and relax with a good book for a day!! 

Happy Dining!!

But the strawberry shake was insipid.
One suggestion, why not allow readers to read books which are unbilled up here?
This might even encourage non readers to start reading and be such a good news to the readers and Oxford lovers.

Location : First floor of Oxford bookstore, right beside The Park.

Take a book from the shelves, climb up the stairs, take a seat, sit back and relax. The laid back ambience of cha bar is what really attracted me.

Nice clean white walls, accessorised with rustic mugs, black prints and different artefacts!

Food ordered:

‚Ä¢ Fish and chips : This dish is a cross between the British Fish & chips and the Bengali fish fry. The fish was sooo flavourful and the coating crispy. The fish was kept marinating in a marinade and was breaded and fried in front of me. It was so fresh and flavourful. The fries were crispy and generous portion of mayo was served. 
4 pieces of fish with fries and mayo - ‚Çπ130

‚Ä¢ Hot chocolate : This drink could've been a bit better. It tasted like bourn vita albeit a little diluter. Price-‚Çπ60

Definitely a must visit. Picket pinch is very low and they charge a meagre tax!

Located inside Oxford Bookstore in Park Street, Cha Bar is an appropriate place for book lovers where one can enjoy reading while sipping some really good flavored teas.  It is quite spacious and the d√©cor is classy. I have always preferred tea over coffee and this place do have some good variety. I like their Herbal Tea, Fruit Melange and Ayurvedic Tea. I always end up ordering among these light flavored teas. With them the Chicken Tikka Slaw Rolls and Chicken Doner Kebab Wrap goes well. Quantity they serve is good. Sandwiches are also palatable but I would recommend Roast Chicken and Mayo Sandwich.  The service is slow but still this place is special for cha & boi lovers.

The Oxford cha bar of Calcutta felt much better than delhi. It's spacious and the ambiance is amazing. 

While the book store is at the ground floor and the cafe is at first, you can sit with a cup of tea and look around. It's blissful.

A book launch was happening near by while I ordered a milk shake and some fish and chips. The menu looked same to that of delhi so there wasn't much scope to explore in it further. Hence, the regular. 

Being honest, one should hardly care about the food and just come here to absorb the feeling of being a bookstore in an old charming city of Calcutta where you sit and observe yellow taxis outside the gate and people rushing to their destinations.

Given that the place is inside a bookstore it's ambience is without doubt excellent. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered a non veg pasta. The good part is nothing is too pricey here, yet the quantity is almost good enough for two people. The staff are also well mannered and that's all very nice. However, the food I found very oily and had to leave a ¬†certain amount as leftover because it was totally immersed in oil towards the end. Still, considering the taste, quantity and price it's all forgivable.A 3.5 from me. Cheers

O it's a wonderful place to sit and chat n enjoy your favourite cup.
The d√©cor is so simple , unique and charming.
Coming to the food.... well.... it lives up to its name.
If you are a 'cha' lover you would adore this place.
We tried 3 different types and all were good.
The sandwich was good n so was the blueberry muffin.
I simply loved this place.

Surrounded by books and fragrant with tea, cha bar is a great place to relax with a cup of tea and your newly bought book. The tea here is excellent and you are spoilt with endless choices. Organic to decaf, herbal to fruit infusion, gunpowder to Chinese. After reading through the elaborate menu I settled for the all time favourite Darjeeling Gold, an afternoon tea which is consumed without milk or sugar. Take your time and ask for advice to choose the tea best suited for the mood. The decor is predominantly black N white with some colour thrown in(see pics). There are interesting tea trivia on walls which make for a great read

The food is simple yet tasty, the perfect accompaniments with the tea. I loved their chicken asparagus quiche, their sandwiches and grand ma's cakes. The non fussy, simple cakes which make your tea taste even better.

The aroma of good tea and the smell of books are both intoxicating and this landmark bookstore dishes out both with equal ease.

Nothing could be more addictive than the combination of a good book and a good cup of coffee. Cha bar is that destination. Situated on the first floor of Oxford Book Store; a warm and delightful hangout for the bibliophiles. Nice and simple decor that reflects the glory of literature. They offer you a very good range of tea and coffee, to choose from, along with delicious mocktails and smoothies. The sandwiches are good. The tea cakes and the pastries are nice as well. The cookies however are quite a lot down. Most of the times they are bland and not so crisp. Cha Bar used to offer English breakfast, which I really, really miss. It would be nice to see them re introduce it in their menu.

Food: Just after lunch so couldnt indulge in the delicious fare laid out. I settled for a raspberry flavoured ice tea while my friend asked for a jasmine tea. Both were powerful, mildly scented and beautiful. I intend to get back and try all the different kinds of tea the place has to offer.

This place is definitely one of the famous cafes of park street and is frequented by book lovers or park street hoppers, etc. The decor is minimalistic but serene. Staff are okish. They have a myriad of choices when it comes to teas, but when ever i go i give it a lot of thought and finally end up ordering their masala teas. They are quite fabulous. I also like their sandwiches.

A recent visit to cha bar was while waiting for a friend at Park Street. A friend and I went inside and took our seats. Loved the ambience and service. My friend liked his chai hindustani and I settled down with a okayish earl Grey tea. We called for a roast chicken sandwich was decent enough. The raisin muffin we ended our meal with was hard which spoilt the taste. Would revisit soon ;)

Situated inside Oxford Bookstore in Park Street, Cha Bar has an impeccably bookish atmosphere perfect for bookworms as well as tea lovers. They offer a variety of wonderful teas and one would be spoilt for choices from a varied selection. Went there with a close friend and over the much popular British fish-and-chips - served with a white dip and lemon wedges - and Affogato coffee we spent a great time over chitchat and small talks. Needless to say both coffee and snacks were awesome. I've even tried their Darjeeling Gold tea and masala chai and both emanate the refreshing taste of freshly-brewed tea. Like Cafe Coffee Day, Cha Bar is a great warm place to have some light conversation with a special someone, engage in addas with a group of friends, organise a workshop or a talk or even chill out alone with a book and a cuppa tea. When one's tired of browsing books in the downstairs bookshop one can always climb up the wooden stairs to the tea bar. Their tea kettle decor is also worth mentioning.

I was in Kolkata a week back for the world t20 final on sunday and i reached on saturday itself to explore the food scene here. I have been to Cha bar before but in Delhi. This concept of a book store cum tea/coffee shop i quite admire. To start with the ambience , it is quite spacious and the location was just 1 km from my hotel, so it was quite convinient to reach there. 
On the ground floor is the bookstore and on the upper level is the seating and there are a variety of books on the upper level which you can read and sipping into your tea or coffee along with a number of snacks to eat. It has a great ambience and nobody would mind sitting there an extra hour if he has time.
At first i ordered the assam tea and ham& cheese sandwhich. Both were good but nothing extraordinary. After having my sandwich and reading my book for some time i decided to drink something i have never tried, so going through the menu i stuck at tea named russian caravan which is influenced by russian traders who drank this tea at night in their caravan by simmering the tea and has a smoky flavour to it. It was quite wonderful and strong and i loved it . I also tried fish and chips which were excellent and were made out of betki fish which is generally used in the bengal region. 
The staff was quite helpful and when they learnt i am not from kolkata they become even more courteous and were very happily serving.

A lovely coffee shop tucked away on top of Oxford Bookstore. Simply loved the ambiance. Great for hanging out alone or with friends or family. The Roast Chicken and Mayo Sandwich is a must try. It's huge and filling. The muffins are also amazing! I would love to visit the place again and again and again...

Revised after 2 years: this time we ordered the Bun Kebab. The bun kebab burger was filling and delicious. But I was really disappointed with the fact that big insects were flying around and sitting on our food. It's a complete nuisance. I'm never going back there ever again if they can't do proper pest control. Plus they don't serve you free water plus charge you service charge on top of service tax.

Changing my rating from 5 to 3 after 2nd visit.

Cha Bar is this lovely Paradise-like place located right above Oxford Bookstore in Park Street. Easy to locate. This place allows you to take books from Oxford upstairs and flip through their pages while sipping your hot cha.

Cha Bar food is average. There's nothing exciting about them. What IS exciting though, is their interior. You can see shelves with uncountable books when you look down. Trivia etched on their walls about cha, people talking in hushed voices and crisp sounds of pages turning all adds up to their ambience.

However, it must be pointed and stressed upon that Cha Bar has a horrible staff. They alone have managed to ruin my experience at Cha Bar for more than two or three times. They are rude. The person on register certainly needs to brush up on his manners. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the service there is S-L-O-W. Waiters are seen to chat around, laugh, crack jokes among themselves in stead of doing what they are supposed to do.

Cha Bar would have definitely gotten a three from me if it weren't for their staff.

Basically the top floor of the vintage oxford book store in park street. 
The aroma of cha and books creates an eccentric aura. 
This place is a modern rendition of the kolkata adda with cha. 
We crashed in after a very happening and tiring day. 
The menu constituted of vast array of cha choices I took the nilgiri cha. It was full of flavor. 
The decor emphasized on the legacy of cha and it was pocket friendly. 
We had a hearty adda even after we settled the bill and they din seem to mind. 
If you want to have a typical lazy kolkata adda and happen to be in park street this place can be a very good option.

I like this concept of bookstore caf√©s where you can pick up your favourite books and browse through them while enjoying your favourite Cuppa. I find it very relaxing and cathartic to just stop for a while, sip my Coffee and browse through my literary books in a pleasant environment like the one offered by Cha Bar. Honestly I don't come here for the food and I'm sure nobody does, so my review is based more on the experience part of it than on the food. The place is beautifully done up with different knick knacks on the wall, complete with bookshelves and posters. The place gives out a great vibe and serves good enough food as well. I usually order the iced latte with a truffle pastry or muffin.

It's quiet, uncluttered, and gives you the option to sit for hours with a book you can pick from the Oxford Bookstore. It's one of my favourite coffee shops in Kolkata.

Cha Bar is one of those few cafes in Kolkata that is situated inside a bookstore. Hence it makes for a good place to enjoy some tea or coffee over your favourite book, or even as a quite and peaceful hangout zone for meeting up with friends. The decor is bright and the graphiti on the walls are quite quirky, and the touch of white and brown all around adds a level of sophistication. 

Their cappuccino is quite good. I have heard good things about their Cha Bar Blend, so if you are a tea person, you can give it a try. They have only one variety of cold coffee which is the Iced Caffe Latte, and it is very average. One big disappointment of this place is that 90% of the food items printed on their menu is never available. No matter how many times I go there, the only savouries available are the ones that are displayed behind their glass counter. So dont be fooled by their food menu, as the actual options are quite limited. Nevertheless, their wraps and quiches are quite good. I have had their Chicken Tikka Wrap, and the Chicken and Asparagus Quiche, both of which are quite tasty. I have heard from my friends that their Chocolate Truffle Pastries are good, but I am yet to try out one for myself.

The biggest pro of this place is their prices, which are quite pocket friendly. One cup of Cappuccino costs Rs. 60 + taxes, which is quite cheap indeed.

Books are Man's best friend. And reading a books goes hands in gloves with a hot beverage. And the king of hot beverages is Tea. So the concept of tea and books is just great. Located just above the Oxford Book Store, Cha Bar offers you an amazing & cosy decor and ambience. You will find different interesting factoids about tea all over the place. I got a Darjeeling Tea and an apple crumb pie. The Darjeeling tea was infused to perfection and the pie was very delicious. It was a nice experience going. 

P.S.: Zomato site of Cha Bar says it opens at 9.30am, but it actually opens at 11am on the rife. Its not updated yet.

I was here a few months back. And it was not the greatest of experiences for me. But that is unsurprising given that am not even a chai aficionado let alone a connoisseur. 

But as far as providing a place to sit and chill in goes, this is a really good choice. Surrounded by books, you can pick one and keep reading or work on your laptop at your leisure.

One of the prime reasons why I go here is that it is well surrounded with books. Being an avid reader, cafes in bookstores have always fascinated me. Ambience is the hands down winner when we talk about Cha Bar. It is a place where you can spend 2-3 hours of your leisure time and keep having the snacks they serve.
I won't say that their menu is extraordinary but whatever they serve is pretty decent. Rates are cheap. Ab evening meal with coffee would cost you around 200-300. Chicken quiche may not be perfect but can be tasted with coffee. Rolls and sandwiches are good enough to fill your stomach. I still have to try their fish and chips combo, heard it is quite value for  money.
Beverages: Good variety of teas, that's why the name! ;) Filter coffee is okayish. Chocolate shake can be improvised further. 
Lastly the staff, very courteous and polite. No issues on the service front. Cheers :)

We are always in search of new places and new experiences for more food. After visiting this place we are more than gluttonous about Cha Bar. The place is really sweet and cosy above the Oxford Book store in Park Street beside The Park Hotel. Want to grab a book and enjoy a warm cup of special Darjeeling Tea? This place is perfect.

It was Christmas morning and we wanted to have our breakfast in a light manner. Cha Bar was our choice. The place is really cute above the book store with part wooden stairs and part steel stairs.
‚Ä¢
A very simple place to enjoy tea or coffee along with a book.
‚Ä¢
Talking about the food we ordered some  warm and exquisite Nilgiri Tea. It was too good and refreshing after a long morning walk in Maidan.
‚Ä¢
We ordered Roasted Chicken & Mayo Sandwich along with some freshly fried French Fries. Simple yet delicious. Our breakfast was done in a perfect manner.

Cha Bar won our hearts with its simplicity and pocket-friendly prices. I've decided to return back to this lovely place with a book in my hand and relax with a cup of tea or coffee for hours.

I love to visit this place to just sit amidst so many books and enjoy the charming ambiance.¬†
The Darjeeling first flush, the blueberry muffin and the Chicken and asparagus quiche are a must try when you choose to visit.

This place should be Kolkata's treasure, nothing less.
Cold evenings and a sore throat brought me here. 
Its such a change from the caf√©s dotting every corner, so tranquil, one could simply get a book of his /her choice and simply get lost here for hours. For not the bibliophile, its still a great place to chat for hours.
Service is leisurely but absolutely effeminate and kind, politely suggesting pairings, and milk additions, plus teas perfect for the mood. Don't hesitate to ask for their opinions, worth it!
I chose Darjeeling Second Flush for me, and Kashmiri Kahwa for her (they politely suggested to drink it sans milk--but she insisted) and a Tomato and Cheese Sandwich and a Chicken and Asparagus Quiche to much on.
My tea was bang on perfect, steeped just to the intensity I love. I reordered a cup of it.
Her kahwa was spicy, hot, creamy and soothing....perfect, she said. 
The tomato and cheese sandwich was very cheesy, buttery and had fresh juicy slices of tomatoes in it, toasted to a well golden brown.
The Quiche was very well made: Flaky warm pastry encasing a moist, generous filling of chicken. A bit bland, but easily fixed with a dollop of ketchup. 
Bill for three cups of tea and the munchies came to ‚Çπ445. Very value for money,  plus superb service and the books...I'll definately be returning very soon. :)

A sore throat and a cold winter evening always seems to get better and warmer when you have a cup of spicy Kashmiri Kawa in your hands and your friend's company. Time seemed to fly by as we sat in those chairs and gave adda munching on our cheese grilled sandwiches and ¬†sipping on our teas. She had ordered a steaming cup of Darjeeling Second Flush. She said she loved it but my Kawa was light, delicately flavored with spices. I loved it because it soothed my sore throat and as for the sandwich,it was yummy enough for me (I am not a cheese person). As for the Chicken and Asparagus Quiche, I loved it. It melted in my mouth perfectly but unfortunately it wasn't served to us with Cheese Sauce and Salad. That was a huge turn off.

P.S- The service was REALLY SLOW
P.P.S- I am someone who always eats at clean places.So it wa really upsetting when I noticed flies flying around and trying to sit on our food and cups.

Excellent cafe inside oxford book store at park street. Its tough not to like this place. Menu is elaborate for tea lovers. Tired of walking in park street, or just need a quite place. Skip CCD/Barista next time you are there, and Cha Bar won't disappoint you.

Undoubtedly the place is great, peaceful and relaxing with a cool and comfortable atmosphere. But I don't know how come my bill for just 2 cup of coffee worth Rs 60 each & a sandwich worth Rs 100 becomes Rs 340. Either the service tax is too high or else there is some error on their part. I am quite disappointed. Also the sandwich was not upto the mark.

Sometimes, we need to spend some time in solitude, so as to indulge in affording some time to ourselves to nurture our thoughts. Be it alone or be it with your closest buddies with whom you can share your thoughts and vice versa, a visit to "Cha bar" is what you deserve.
Located at Park Street, upstairs of Oxford book store, this place is something that allows you to get absorbed in its peaceful ambience, and helps you to nurture your thoughts. If you are passionate about reading books, this place is sure to delight you with its peaceful charm and mellifluous ambience.
So while walking down Park Street, if all of a sudden it starts raining heavily, and you are right in front of Oxford, dont think twice to walk in at "Cha Bar".
Trust me friends, having a cup of tea in solitude, followed by a few yummilicious bites while looking at the view of rain from the glass window of "Cha bar" or while reading a book seating on the bench in reading zone is surely a memory deserves to be reserved as a prized possession in heart.
A place you should visit mandatorily.

Cozy and classy outlet. Perfect for a weekend catch up. You get to bring up books from the Oxford Bookstore downstairs, to read up while you munch and chat.
The mixed fruit iced tea and the lemonade were refreshing. A must-visit for teenagers and college students.

Having stayed out of the city for quite a while, I headed back to this place with a tentative mind but was pleasantly surprised at their makeover.
Firstly, it was great to see that the place was maintained well (the last time I visited, their AC wasn't working), their interiors completely redone and the menu, thankfully, as extensive as before.
Being a hardcore tea lover, this is one of the few places that serve exquisite tea and caters to a very niche crowd.
It was great to find the place teeming with people from diverse backgrounds which only reaffirmed its appeal.
We started off with a classic darjeeling gold which was very flavourful and had the intrinsic nature of darjeeling tea. I had asked for a fruity variant and decided on the South African Roiboos which was mind blowing. It had subtle flavours of cinnamon and berries that gave a very refreshing and smooth texture to the tea.
We had ordered an Apple and Raisin Muffin to go along with the tea which was fluffy with a perfectly done crust. The taste blended very well with the tea.
Although pretty full, we decided to try their purple rose tea which again blew our mind with the slight sweet and fruity flavour. 
The Chicken and Asparagus Quiche was fresh and well done.
Every item that I had at this place exceeded my expectations. To top it off, the opportunity to pick up your favourite books and read them at leisure, makes this place an even more enchanting option for book lovers like myself.
I highly recommend this place for tea and book lovers :)

Okay, I know this is supposedly a favourite place to hang out, but I was kind of disappointed. Today my friend and I went to check this place out. And this is what we thought of it...
The location couldn't have been better. Inside the Oxford Book store is an amazing place to be. You take a book and enjoy a warm tea, coffee or some quick snacks -aah, heaven! Also the walls had these cute facts written about tea all over the world, really nice. So full marks for location and ambience!

The sheer variety of teas will leave you amazed! I myself am a very safe person, so I didn't dare to experiment on my very first visit, lest I should be disappointed. So I went with the Cha Bar Blend and my friend ordered a tiger hill with gunpowder variant. I loved my tea - it's a typical masaledaar tea with milk and sugar to taste. The best part was it came in a cute glass holder which I absolutely adored. Hers came in a normal mug, without milk and the taste was simpler in nature.¬†

Then we tried to order some chicken and asparagus and another oven baked chicken lasagna but this is where Cha Bar disappointed us. There were a very limited number of food items available - only the ones those were displayed in the showcase. You don't expect this from an elegant place like Cha Bar. Anyway, disappointed and hungry, we ordered for a plate of chicken nuggets, which basically turned out to be the ready-to-fry chicken nuggets which you get in the market - 10 pieces, with ketchup and mayo on the side.¬†

The chicken nuggets could not satiate our appetite, rather made it worse. But we were so unimpressed with the food stock of Cha Bar that we didn't order anything else here and went out and had some roadside food.¬†So all in all - lovely location, great concept of reading books and sipping on warm tea, varieties of tea available, maybe improve on your food stocks a bit.

Only memories.
Yes ,

A place where i find peace as well as good snacks.

Because coffee and books are just made for each other ?

Cha bar is my favourite.
When in Kolkata, cha bar is a must visit place to chill your mind ,
to read good books and to have the best tea ever .

The best thing about cha bar is their tea glasses. Glasses like local tea vendors with steel handle structured as monkey.


I love to spend hours here ,

Also i love their latte , chai and chicken nuggets. 

Legendary indeed  :)

Been here for the 1st time, any one can fall in love with the ambiance.. Like being within Oxford bookstore has its perks.
Well decorated, cosy place..
Let's come to the part with which a foodie will be mostly concerned, the food.
We ordered mocha, cottage cheese sandwiches, chicken kebabs.
Well I was not satisfied at all!
The mocha was horrible tasted more like bournvita. 
Sandwiches were okish though I didn't like mustard with cottage cheese still.
Kebabs, were dry, tasted okish, served with kasundi ... But tasted more like those ready to eat kebabs ...
Prices mostly on the higher end..
Service is decent.
Well I won't go there again, if not for the ambiance..

This place is delightful - lovely ambience, books all around - what more can you ask for? You can read while you sip your tea; or just come for chit-chat over coffee, while you take in the aroma of loads and loads of books surrounding you! Plus, the teas are awesome (and fairly priced) - tried cappuccino and jasmine tea - really well prepared. Feel-good factor. Totally recommended :)

Any book lover in the city would have had visited the Oxford Bookstore which is situated in Park Street. And what can be better than a cup of tea while reading a book, right? Cha Bar is located on the first floor of the Oxford Bookstore and has one of the best collection of teas in the city. I have visited the bookstore many a times but never had the chance of trying the teas or the food in Cha Bar. So when I was invited by blogger Indrajit Lahiri for this event, I was pretty excited. 

The first thing that would strike your eyes as soon as you enter the place is the brilliant decor and the ambience. The wall art provides you with interesting tea trivia and many exciting design elements. Such an unique way to enlighten us with the brilliant facts! As we were having a chat among ourselves, Mr. Nitin Warikoo, (Head Cha Bar and Business Development) joined us and shared with us many facts about Cha Bar.¬†
If you go through the menu, you will come across more than 150 kind of teas, but thankfully, they selected a few special teas for us and that made our decisions easier. I, being not so experimental with tea, opted for a simple Masala Cha which I was told is amazing. After having the first sip, I agree to the fact that it was brilliant with the perfect amount of spices. An interesting item on the menu was the Bollywood Mix Masala Cha. On being asked about its specialty, Nitin told us that this has a bit subtle taste with slightly lower degree of spices and it is served in the kettles painted by Pakistani truck artists. 

There are many other types of teas which include some Ayurvedic and herbal teas and a wide range of green teas. You also have the option of trying the local teas from various parts of the world like the Kashmiri Kahwa or the Bhutanese Noon Cha. One interesting thing is that all these teas are served in the traditional ways and that enhances your experience to completely another level. If you are a fan of green tea, you might try the Arabic Spice tea which is basically green tea infused with some spices. The Moroccan Mint tea is yet another good pick in the list. Nitin also recommended to have Panchdhatu which is infused with five different Ayurvedic herbs that relate to the five different elements in the Human Body.
For us Indians, tea pairs the best with some sort of savory items. Cha Bar offers you an amazing variety of sandwiches to go along with your tea. Though there are a lot of options to try from, you must surely have the Roast Chicken and Mayo Sandwich which had a generous amount of Mayo to please your taste buds. I also loved the Squished Egg and Kasundi Mustard Sandwich as you know that the pairing of eggs with the flavor of mustard is just perfect. If you are looking for vegetarian options, you may try the Cheese and Tomato Grilled Sandwich.
The latest entrant in the menu of Cha Bar is the Fish and Chips, which is highly recommended by Nitin. What can be better than a thick fillet of basa, thinly coated and fried to perfection, paired with some crunchy french fries and Mayo? Sounds delicious, right? It was frankly the best fish and chips I tried in the city and I would love to go back for more.¬†
As Nitin said, there are some teas which go really well with desserts and so, you might try out the different muffins and pastries available there. 

This is the perfect place to spend some lone time, with a book and a cup of tea or you may also come here and meet over an Adda. Your pick! For students like us who search for budget cafes and restaurants, this is truly an ideal place.

Went in here to try out their teas and desserts. Was craving for a blueberry muffin and ordered it along with a chocolate pastry. Ordered a cappuccino and a creme caramel tea. The muffin was a disaster, all greenish and tasteless. The chocolate pastry was too sweet. But I must say, the tea was pretty good, so was the coffee. I would say this place is strictly for readers who want some alone time.

Cha bar spreads out in the first floor of the Oxford book store. The set up is very appealing and definitely one of its kind. The moment you go up the staircase you see a casual seating arrangement. Yesterday I had time before my tuition and decided to drop in. The seats were occupied when we went in so after waiting for about 10 minutes we got a place to sit. The seats overlooked the ground floor so you could see people browsing the books and few got a book to read while sipping on various teas. 
The decoration is very kitschy and casual. The posts on the wall make for an amazing read while waiting for your order. The cute kettles, various bottled forma of pasts, mugs etc make the decor unique. 

Coming to the food, we had ordered raspberry iced tea and to go with it we wanted jalape√±o fritters,rosemary roast chicken with glass noodles or fish and chips. Unfortunately,none of it was available. Finally we ordered fries. They took a long time to serve the fries and taste wasn't too good. It was soft and salt was less. 
For service what I'd say is its one of the slowest I've encountered in a long time. Their menu is amazing and so is their decor and ambience probably that's why it has so many customers. But despite this I'd like to go back and try other items off their menu.

I was curious about this place inside the Oxford Bookstore at Park Street for a long time but never happened to be here. So when Indrajit, a blogger friend, said they were launching a new menu and asked whether I would be interested to join as they would like to meet some bloggers in this regard, I had no reason to think over it.

So we met up at this Sunday afternoon last month. 

This is a spacious L-shaped caf√© on the mezzanine floor overlooking the bookstore, tastefully decorated with innovative wall art which has a lot of tea trivia. There are stools and chairs (two and four-seater) to sit, and wooden seats attached to the wall. It is a nice place for a relaxed chat with friends/ colleagues/ business contacts. One can carry a book from the shelves and read it here over tea and snacks.

The menu is dominated by a wide range of tea, as expected, including Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiri. The Darjeeling and Assam varieties come from their (Apeejay group‚Äôs) own tea estates. The menu covers practically all conceivable varieties of tea over thirteen pages, including organic, decaf, herbal, green, fruit fusion, Ayurvedic, Chinese teas and an uncommon Indian variety like oolong tea which has a small production).

A special one page menu was made for our meet and presented to each one of us, comprising seventeen handpicked varieties of tea, some veg and non-veg snacks, cakes and muffins.

We ordered Bollywood Mix Masala Tea, Arabic Spice tea, Fish n Chips, Roast Chicken & Mayo Sandwich, Squished Egg and Kasundi Mustard sandwich and Cheese & Tomato Sandwich. I ordered an iced tea as I wasn‚Äôt feeling like having a hot beverage. The waiter was smartly dressed in their black t-shirt and white brimless cap.

The food comes from The Park, which is in the Apeejay group that owns Oxford Bookstore. I loved the Roast Chicken & Mayo Sandwich. The chicken was tender and the mayo was generous. At Rs 110, it‚Äôs not expensive given the quality. I am fond of the chicken and egg sandwich at Just Baked which has mustard in it. Mustard, mixed with boiled egg in the right measure, can bring out a different taste of the bland egg. The Squished Egg and Kasundi Mustard sandwich was good too, though I felt it could be better if the egg was cut into tiny pieces.

Enter the Fish n Chips, piping hot. Succulent, flaky fish encased in a thin crust. It was delicious and worth the claim, I felt. Two longer and one short piece of fried fish with tartar sauce and finger chips at just Rs 130 is a killer deal! They use basa fish as for them it is easy to get a consistent quality compared to bekti.

A word on Bollywood Mix Masala Tea- it is your regular masala tea served in a kettle decorated with Pakistani-style truck art of Hindi filmstars. If you like the kettle, you can even buy one off the shelves near the counter. The tea is poured in glass (as it is with cutting chai of Mumbai). 

As I understood, they offer tea and good food at a reasonably cheaper price than comparable joints so that it compliments the bookstore experience well. The tea starts at just Rs 34! It should also appeal to those who want to come here just for good food. The value seekers may like this place more than Flury‚Äôs and Au Bon Pain which are good but definitely overpriced. Cha Bar is also very particular about how a beverage or a food item is served and love to innovate on it.

Would like to come back especially for the Fish n Chips.

For a long, long time, I was practically fed up with Park St. No, not with the foodscape, but mostly with the tea lounge/ cafe scenario. Either there were places like CCD, Flury‚Äôs- which are good, but definitely overpriced and mostly comprising of varieties of coffee- definitely somewhere depriving the city tea lovers. Now this time, when I was invited to Cha Bar (inside Oxford book store, park hotel premises) along with Kolkata Food Bloggers, I was surprised, as well as excited.

How to go and when to go:

This place is impossible to miss. Oxford Bookstore is in the park hotel premises, on the main road and Cha Bar is on its first floor. Its in operation from 11 AM till 9 PM, hence one need not hurry.

And the scenario inside:

When we entered the premises, as we have for numerous times, the place is a book lover‚Äôs paradise. An entire floor covering books and only books. The first floor, on the other hand, is dedicated to tea and food to go with. When one enters from the first time, the interior will stun him for sure. The walls are done in red and white and is designed with lots of interesting graffiti concerning the tea-tasting culture‚Ä¶.

Apart from at least 40 varieties , maybe even more, of tea (Cha bar menu), they make a good variety of sandwiches and they‚Äôve recently launched the famed fish and chips (only @130/-). The tea varieties are priced mostly within the price range of 60 -120/- and sandwiches (two thick slices with chips and dip) and priced around 120/-.

¬†
Sandwiches were great and fish and chips was really, really thinly coated (as it should be) and consisted of a pretty thick basa fillet. I am not such an authority to comment about tea, as I‚Äôm frankly not a tea-connoisseur, but the menu line-up seemed to interest my fellow tea-enthusiasts much.¬†

All in all, its a nice experience and if one goes there, the pocket pinch for two, should not be more than 200/- per head‚Ä¶. And the best part, they let you sit and enjoy the ambiance for long (basically they don‚Äôt kick you out once the meal is finished). So, what better than to relax on a autumn afternoon sipping a cup of finely prepared tea and letting the busy world pass by. I would suggest, go for it, as I am becoming a regular there‚Ä¶..

A really really nice place to go to, if you want to catch up with an old friend or for a date that involves a lot of good conversation. A perfect place to sit and talk and even better place to sit and read. The array of teas available are really impressive ! We ordered A Moroccan mint tea, Earl Grey, An Iced Coffee Latte, Kebab Platter, Blueberry Muffins and Black Forest Cake. The teas were simply amazing and the amount of tea for the price doesn't hurt your pocket. The Iced coffee Latte, priced at just a mere eighty rupees is so much better and more in quantity than what most Cafe chains have to offer. The Muffin and the the Cake too were really nice, with the muffin smelling like it was freshly baked and even a bit warm ! The kebabs were disappointing though. They were like the ready to fry type and the kashundi dip accompanying it just doesn't fit. All in all, a really good place to spend hours surrounded by books and bibliophiles and having a heart to heart conversation away from the din outside. This place though is not for people who are going there specifically to eat. This is more like a reader's paradise and a perfect spot for adda.

It's a mediocre place. Just too mediocre with absolutely no special features. The place is nicely organized and decked above the Oxford book house, park street. So if you go there regarding any book issues, you can sit and relax for a while. But just going there in order to have snacks is absolutely not worthwhile.

This quintessential tea caf√© inside Oxford Bookstore has been a popular choice for those who love the city‚Äôs adda culture. With smartly designed graphics brightening up pristine white walls and wooden flooring. Cha Bar strikes a beautiful balance between quirky and classic.¬†

If the screaming and smoking of "adda-baj" people of Indian Coffee house disgust you then this is the perfect place for you to relax & chat sipping on a revitalizing cup of tea! First we ordered Mint ice tea (which was so refreshing) &¬†blue berry muffins along with chicken nuggets (which my friend took). Then comes the main part - "Fried fish and chips" which was oh-so-yummy!! Lip smacking good!! Along with these came a few more rounds of blueberry & black current ice tea! A perfect elixir to quench your thirst and relax listening to the soothing music playing in the background. You might even start humming your favorite tune while turning a leaf over from your favorite novel..!!!¬†

I only wish if this place would have been nearby to my locality...it would have been a real pleasure relaxing and watching the world go by!

Nice and cosy place to spend quality time. Book and knowledge lovers will love this small "cha bar" . Off course there are lots of cafes in the city but this one is very special as its the only cafe that houses inside a book shop. This combination is unparalleled by others. 
Tea's - a tea lovers paradise as it offers a lot of different varieties including the famed 'silver needle'. The prices are very reasonable. On the snacks front there is just limited fare on offer üòä.

This place is ideal for people looking to get refreshed and have a nice 'adda'.

It was a delightful return to a place I have often spent hours in, seeking refuge from the hectic schedules of life. The Cha Bar at the Oxford Bookstore has reinvented itself with a whole new menu that will entice the taste buds of the book lovers and foodies alike. The various kinds of teas, sandwiches and savouries available offer a challenge to be matched upto. I would recommend the Egg mustard sandwich and the Arabic spice tea definitely. Quite a spread had been laid out for us menu tasters but we could manage a few. 
A special mention of the decor must be made here. Also of the attentive staff. The Cha Bar has a lot to offer for anyone who wishes to find himself a few hours with food for thought and for the palate.

Oxford Book Store for me is a bibliophile's haven.I simply love this place.It has a very international feel to it because in foreign countries you usually come across such quaint places where you can sit with a book for hours.There are no waiters harassing you with the bill or a rowdy bunch of people getting on your nerves.

Plus the Cha Bar Cafe is splendid.Top marks to the Ham and Cheese Sandwich,the Caffe Latte( a personal favourite) and the Blueberry Muffins.The Moroccan Mint Tea is divine.

The staff is great and they are very helpful.Its a wonderful place to shut out the world and spend quality time by yourself or a special first date.It really is my most favourite hangout in Kolkata.

I love coming bck to this place for the amazing ambience. The Cha Bar is the cafe area of the Oxford Bookstore in Park street, and one can have an assured good time reading his favourite author while sipping Teas and coffees. I happened to visit the place a couple of days back to buy few books with my friend and ended up chit chatting at the Cha Bar. We ordered 2 plates of Fish and Chips and Chicken Nuggets alongwith Green Tea and Cappuccino. All were good. Had a great time after ages.

Calcutta badly needs more places like this.
Go to any other country and there are plenty of places to choose from when friends decide to hangout and chat for a long time. all we have here are some hundred caf√© s but none of them but this perfectly suits me. The ambience, the atmosphere and the serenity, coupled with an exotic tea, is just perfect here to talk your hearts out to a dear friend, and even just relax with a book. It is informal and comfortable, so much so that I like to go all the way to this place even though there are several CCDs and Barista s that fall on my way to Cha Bar.

Excellent ambience..amazing.. with light melodious music playing and books allover.. if you are a bookworm.. its heaven for you.. books, tea, snack and music... too perfect .. but the only problem is the availablity of food.. we thought of ordering sausages.. it wasnt available..many food items werent there and teas too.. the ones on display were mostly available and milkshakes and ice teas.. we had fish and chips too.. which was a very good bargain @130 only. Overall its a very cool place to hangout .

One of the best places to just sit and enjoy your cup of tea with a quite ambience. . I have visited this place many  a times n every time I visit the place their service remain the same.. its good.. clean.. well maintained... pocket friendly. . Unique crockery and cutlery on display as well as on the tables.. overall a nice place to spend your afternoon rather than roaming around during the hot humid days in kolkata.

If you are a bookworm you will go ga ga over this place. It is situated inside the oxford bookstore so grab a cuppa and indulge in reading classics or new releases. Now coming to the food part- we ordered flavoured lemon tea,hot chocolate and fish n chips. Lemon tea was okayish. Fish and chips was yumm. But i didn't like the hot chocolate much, bournvita tastes better than that!
Well, i loved the ambience and it's surely a heaven for book lovers like me.

Well it's quaint little place inside the Oxford book store.  It used to be a much smaller place... But had grown in size over the years.  The tea is actually nice and is a good place to sit and catch up with friends.  The savouries are usually sourced from other places with a mark up.  
For me the ambience is a great attraction.... Have a cup while going through a few of the books you have chosen is quite a stress buster.. Parking in park Street is the only problem

Cha Bar - An average place to have 'Cha'¬†
=====
Location +Intro: Located above the oxford book store, Park Street. I was walking by this area with one of my friend and suddenly out of nowhere, it struck my mind to visit Cha bar. It was on my wishlist since a very long time. I personally came and sat on the top near the counter with my friend. I thought it to be a self service outlet because since 10 minutes nobody came to attend. When i went to the counter, the staff sent another staff to take orders. I found it a bit weird. Nevertheless, nicely made menu card with loads of tea's and coffee's to drink and less of food to munch. I somehow decided to order some ice tea for me and my friend as we weren't in the mood to eat something.¬†

This review is solely for the purpose of hospitality and wrong charging of my bill. Please take notice Cha Bar.¬†
=====
What i ordered:

1) Passion Fruit Ice Tea - It was nice. However, it was excessively sweeter.

2) Peace Ice tea - My old favorite is still my favorite. Made perfectly. #musttry.
=====
Meal for two: 200-400
=====
Pros:
1) Ambience is nice.
2) Prime Location.
3) Prices are kept very reasonable.
4) Menu is nicely designed.

Cons:
1) Staffs weren't even serving us water when we entered and sat there for quite sometime. This is not at all acceptable. I personally went to the counter to give up my order then thinking it to be a pay and eat concept.¬†
2) The bill we got had a mineral water punched in it. Secondly, we had received two bills for the same amount unnecessarily. The staff literally forced us to accept the bill and pay just the amount excluding the mineral water. I mean what is this? How can this negligence be caused on the part of the Staff? Management take notice.¬†
3) Feedback form thrown on the table with the bill without any Pen and not even taken notice of. It is not actually a formality which you are doing. We are customers and we do take notice.¬†
4) The staffs weren't courteous at all.¬†
=====
Conclusion: I am really unhappy with the service. I shall not visit again. Had really huge expectations from this place but somehow left being disappointed. The good part about the place is you can sit and talk for long. :)¬†
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

I've been to this place for like 5 times and it never fails to impress. Going with a friend for chit chat or just sitting with a book with some delicious varieties of beverages and muffins.. This place has it all!! The soft music gives it a calm and soothing effect. Great place to go and spend time with someone special :-)

For some reason I had overlooked this lovely place despite being a regular visitor at the book store. But after spending time there and sipping the varieties of tea with muffins, I fell in love with the place which is no less than a good book. Just like a good book, she has her chapters well written with teas from across the globe and served with right amount of sugar. The Cha Bar could be the ideal destination for bookworms and the right place for people who want to indulge in a good conversation. Besides the tea, the peaceful ambiance with attracting decor are the things that make Cha Bar stand out from the rest.

A classic place when it comes to sipping different variants of teas in Calcutta under a single roof.

Location. Well connected
Ambiance. Pretty cool
Crowd. Intellectuals and good
Food. We took two different variant of teas. Plenty to choose from the hot teas and less from the cold teas, but a great experience.
Service. I think service is a bit sloppy, the staff are polite but quite laid-back. They have an attitude of "you can try us, if you don't, we're hardly bothered".
Value for Money. Definitely yes

For some reason I had been delaying my read. Maybe cos it was the Classic Literature book which is often very boring. I walked into this place to look for some inspiration & Bam! I read most of it in a couple of hours. I coupled my read with a cup of Darjeeling Tea & a Roast Chicken & Mayo Sandwich which was grilled to perfection. The tea lacked some flavor though. Regardless, if you are looking for some alone time with Heathcliff.
This is it.

This is design exotica.Brilliant idea this connecting a tea bar to a legendary book store.Easy,since the Appejay Paul's are basically from tea.Earlier they used to see cans of tea from different gardens,now they serve it from an awesome array of choice.
The sandwich was ok and the Darjeeling we ordered was brewed in a hurry.I feel for a niche store like this,they need better serving personnel with a little more finesse than ones who are in a hurry to shut shop.
Otherwise this is a one of a kind tea house on Park Street

Went to this place a couple of times. It's a cafe above Oxford, a small place to chill out with friends. I loved the interiors of this place. Now coming to the food, the snacks available here are not worth the price, but the drinks are good and you can surely try them out.
We had ordered raspberry iced tea, blackcurrant iced tea,mint iced tea, hot chocolate,and strawberry milkshake. And a black forrest pastry. The raspberry iced tea is a must have in summer. The chilled drink is refreshing and jazzy. It kind of refreshes your system entirely. The blackcurrant iced tea is a bit tangy. The mint iced tea was really minty flavoured, it had the taste of chloromint! The hot chocolate and the strawberry milkshake is a complete No-No. The hot chocolate tasted like complan in chocolate flavour and strawberry milkshake had no taste and flavour and was a complete waste of money.
So if you every go there order the raspberry iced tea and you would be good to go.

Amongst all those restaurants and outlets at Park Street, this place stands out like a pro. With a heartwarming ambience, eye catching graffiti on the walls, eclectic choices for cha (tea), it sits above the Oxford book store and is as close as it gets to be called a heaven for readers. It's pretty spacious too and one can simply sit and read for hours there. I went with two of my friends there and besides being befuddled while choosing a tea, we had a great time.

Books, Caffeine, A good Sandwich and Peace - Pretty much sums up this gem of a place right in the middle of ever-chaotic Park Street. Decent and tasty food, immense options for beverages to cater to everyone's taste and the privilege to space out for a while and take a break! In an over-crowded city of CCD's, i sincerely wish there were more places like Cha Bar which exceeds expectations whether it comes to food, service, ambience or value for money! Must Try!

This place is a home to hundreds of varities of tea and thousands of books!

5 star for the ambience and the beautiful walls. You can go there and spend hours reading a book or chatting with friends. While they mainly serve pastries, muffins to eat they have dedicated 90% of their menu to different types of tea. So if you fancy a cup of rum tea or vanilla tea or chocolate tea this is the place to visit. Service quality is decent and the place isn't much expensive as well. Definitely worth a try.

Sitting quietly at the top of the Oxford bookstore, this almost inconspicuous little cafe had managed to evade my eyes over my three visits to the store. However, I finally had the opportunity to grab a bite today. Doesn't boast much on space but the items sure do pack a punch! Went there with my gf...ordered a truffle pastry, black forest pastry and an afogatto(certain items we desired were unavailable). Firstly, the truffle is as sinful as it gets and at just 60 bucks it's definitely worth a try. Black forest was as usual and the coffee had a perfect smooth texture that blends with your palate.
Will definitely visit again...hopefully to get a chance to try out some of the other items we had in mind.
P.S: See f u ppl can expand into other franchises...cheers!:-)

It's a cosy little cafe just above the oxford bookstore. Cool decor with ample amount of seating. U can hangout wt friends or sit by urself with a book. The chocolate truffle cake is total heaven for the taste buds and a must have always! Extremely soft and chocolatey!! Looking at the menu u can see so many variety of beverages and especially tea... I would recommend even non-tea lovers to come here and have some of the brews available... And yeah they serve coffee and other drinks too :D. The tea sometimes comes in small cute kettles with ample tea in it to fill at least 2.5 cups... Service was alright.. Have a gala time here whenever I go :-)

The menu has a lot to offer and let me warn you, some are only for serious tea lovers. Else would definitely recommend green mint ice tea crush and the tea fruit cake is a must. Books or a good company you will enjoy the place either ways.

Lovely, neat and classy cafe surrounded by books.....this is all a book-lover needs, especially on a rainy afternoon....Cha-bar has been a favourite of mine, ever since I visited it for the first time, a few years back. Cool place for intellectual discussions, and deep conversations. Nobody bothers you there, even if you sit for hours, chatting over coffee. This place reminds me of a similar cafe (which doesn't exist anymore), I had visited long back, at Starmark, Lord Sinha Road. Apt for romance as well as serious chats. Visited this place on Christmas eve last year, and loved the decor.

The Cha Bar!
Right on top of the Oxford Bookstore at Park Street in Calcutta, Cha Bar is located at the most accessible area of Calcutta. Cabs, Metro, Auto or just plain legs can bring you here pretty easily. :) I can vividly remember me coming here for the first time. Wouldn‚Äôt spill the beans though! ;)
Since then, I‚Äôve been a constant avid guest of theirs so much so that my friends & I had become good pals with the people working at that place. 

I‚Äôll just mention that this is just a great great GREAT place to meet fiends, read, sip away any drink, bite on any mini-eatery, just have your office work done, have any official-unofficial meeting, date or just a small moment all by yourself.

Few things worth trying are: the infamous Masala Chai (absolutely love the way they serve), Chinese Oolong, Earl Grey, Darjeeling Tea, Yellow- Tea-Peach & Pineapple Margarita (OMG ‚Äì awesome), Cha Bar Special Thandai (uhhh‚Ä¶yum!!!), Corn & Spinach Quiche, Chicken & Asparagus Quiche, Blueberry Muffin & Apple Crumble.
Long list, right? But definitely worth it‚Ä¶you take my word people!

Yesterday I was there with ‚Äúahem ahem‚Äù & we both had just teas; we already had dinner planned with a friend so we didn‚Äôt have the luxury of eating something there. A Darjeeling for the ‚Äúahem ahem‚Äù & a Masala Tea for me.
As usual, the teas were uhh-mazing. This place never disappoints me. NEVER!
I felt that my Masala Tea had a little less of the masala¬† this time, However I noticed that the glass was a bit bigger this time with more quantity.
Usually I expect my Cha Bar Masala Tea to be having a bit of a ‚Äòtadka‚Äô type taste which typically hits me in my throat. I add 2-3 sachets of Sugar & I‚Äôm good to drink! .

Nonetheless, I love the ambiance and the calm setting and the mood. This place just lifts me up!
This place is like a mini get-away from the huge hullabaloo of the outside.

So, that‚Äôs that!
Unfortunately, the people have all changed with just one person remaining the same at the counter, who possibly makes the drink & food, I suppose.
Still, the staff is very very friendly. I totally admire their patience & their smiling faces even after a really long day!

I‚Äôm pretty sure that a lot many people have already been here but I had to review Cha Bar.
I‚Äôve got loads of memories etched to this place. :)

You should definitely go if you are an ardent lover of tea & some mini tit-bits! :)
You‚Äôll certainly love it! & again, take my word! :)
Ciao.

Its Park Street, its Oxford Book Store. What more can you really ask for.Let me come to the food later, or probably not even talk about it.¬†
The place is too good to get out of it. Books, books everywhere... Its Oxford... The British feeling... wooden racks, green benches... Makes you feel you are back to school..those libraries.To add to everything, the food is definitely good. The Menu itself takes about quarter of an hour to read. I never knew they could be so many variants of tea.The cafe lets you sit for hours and talk to your beloved, or friends or colleagues over a cup of 'cha'.

It is located inside the Oxford bookstore, where the tea house is more popular than the books. The positives first - a pretty decent selection of tea's are available as should be the case, from the regular tea to masala chai, to the hills of Darjeeling and adding flavours along the way. There is also some snacks you can nibble on.  Ate the brownie there and it was well made.

Now for negatives and there is just one - the service. They really intend to keep you waiting there. I don't know if this is intended or its just them. Very laid back service. Good for those who can brush off a book in that kind of time and the tea is just incidental. For others not so much the case. 

All in all a decent place to meet with friends and get some tea.

Breakfast of 26th January, 2015 spent in this tiny eatery situated right within Oxford on the Park Street. I love this place to hang out as they dont have a lot of crowd often, and when they have a crowd, be sure that some awesome author is in town and is right there.¬†
My standard order is a double espresso and a Ginger Chicken Tikka Wrap. The people here have good coffee, pretty scrumptious wrap and a vast collection of coffee table books. Its a good place to spend some alone time. Next time, I m gonna try the smoothies.

Love reading while sipping your cuppa ? Then this is the place to be. Located in the heart of park street, inside the Oxford book store, this is a favourite joint of mine, for sipping that special cup of tea while browsing through the latest wimpy kid book ! The tea menu here will leave you spoilt for choice, and I make it a point to try out a new one each time. Purple rose and the herbal masala chai being my favourite, and for coffee lovers there's always the cappucino. 
And nothing better than a warm apple crumble, or a chicken Mayo sandwich to go with it. 
Recently they have introduced breakfast menus, but that is not quite up to the mark at present, considering what is being served in other joints in the city at present.

When we entered the place it was totally empty and the only one staff who was almost invisible was showing no interest to attend us. Our experience was not good at all. We ordered our espresso and chicken-asparagus quiches. Both were horrible, specially the chicken quiches was pathetic. Raw chicken smell was coming out of it... I would avoid this place certainly from next time. This place has no standard as a cafe, only the Oxford bookstore along with it can help this place to survive. My rating would be 2.8 overall... That's it

This is the only, yes one and only 'book cafe' in Calcutta. For the kind of person i am, i love to read and want calm ambience, this place caters to my needs in ways more than one. They have nice wooden furniture with portraits
 of some famous personalities interspersed lazily on the wall. You'll find the most diverse diaspora of teas here, of course the name says 'cha bar'; what am i saying right? But its worth mentioning. The best thing about this place is that the waiter never bother you regardless of what your order or how long you sit there, simply while away your time reading, writing or having a deep conversation if you've got company. All in all, this place is for the intellect and sober minded.

When we entered the place it was totally empty and the only one staff who was almost invisible was showing no interest to attend us. Our experience was not good at all. We ordered our espresso and chicken-asparagus quiches. Both were horrible, specially the chicken quiches was pathetic. Raw chicken smell was coming out of it... I would avoid this place certainly from next time. This place has no standard as a cafe, only the Oxford bookstore along with it can help this place to survive. My rating would be 2.8 overall... That's it

A good place to hangout. Nice  & calm place as its inside the library. As per location the price is really cheap. If you want to spend 500Rs for 2 here then I can ensure you that you will have stomach which will be more than full. Friendly staffs good service. You can seat as long as you want but yeah off course you have to order something :P. Will visit again

this little place is just above the oxford bookstore...... went their with a bunch of friends for spending some quality time. most of us opted for the truffle cake and 2 of us for the blueberry muffin!the place was not so little as we expected it! it has some warm decor n soothing ambience. moreover one can stay there as long as he wants. the servings came pretty late but we were least bothered as we friends were having a gala time.¬†¬†the truffle cake stole our hearts. it was hot inside chocolate oozing out from every layer! it was heaven to the taste buds! ^_^¬†the blueberry muffin ,unlike in most of the other places, had a rich and tangy blueberry syrup filled core. another yum....¬†loved the whole experience

This coffee shop, for the past couple of years, has become one of my favorite places to spend some quality time, be it alone, or with friends.

Cha bar is located inside the Oxford Bookstore in the Park Hotel arcade. I love reading and this place gives me an opportunity to add something extra to my reading experience.

The atmosphere, as is expected in a bookstore, is pretty quiet.¬†

The menu offers as many varieties of tea as you can possibly imagine. (It is a different issue that I personally prefer coffee over tea). But the other items like coffees and juices and snacks are also great.

Overall, if you want a slightly different kind of a coffee-shop experince, you must give cha-bar a try.

Cha Bar was an impromptu plan - and we got really unlucky, because they had run out of food mentioned on the menu! It was my first time at Cha Bar and given the options on the menu, I thought it wouldn't be that bad, besides being located so centrally! But, they had very few items left on their menu (hardly 5-6 snacks) and the ones that were there, didn't seem fresh at all! I strongly advise against the corn spinach quiche - it tastes real bad and nothing like a quiche at all. Also, they are highly short-staffed and the food logistics seemed really, really bad.¬†

The only upside was the coffee and their various combinations in hot beverages. I would recommend other better cafes in and around Park Street - let Cha Bar be among your last options.

i was quite excited when my partner took me here..perfect setup to browse through books, have a good conversation and fill yourself with food... but to my dismay, after we spent some good 15 minutes discussing the menu and placed the order, we found that they are not yet serving the food..and mind you,i was hungry. So we settled down for tea and muffins. They do have a wide choice of tea and be careful while choosing..my partner's darjeeling was good but my sikkim was just average.
I do hope they start serving the food items soon.. or else it should atleast be mentioned.Really hated it as zomato menu has misguided us.

A great tea bar in a great book store in a great location. Situated in Oxford book store , one of the finest book store in Kolkata , you can enjoy books and fine tea. It is slightly costly. Sometimes when there is music in the background, books, music and tea makes a deadly combination. ambiance is superb.Prices are slightly higher.

This place is the best when you want to kill time, have a chit-chat session which you want to last longer than usual, when you want to read a book and need a quiet place serving you snacks and tea, when you want to retrospect or introspect on anything in life. This is a regular hangout place for our dates! I will fall short of words just because I attach some special feelings to this place. Not going into all that let me give you a picturesque description of what you should expect.
The place is pocket-friendly unlike CCDs and Baristas. This place is quieter unlike CCDs and Baristas. This place has an unique ambiance unlike CCDs and Baristas.
I recommend, You should order Teas when visiting if you not just-a-coffee-lover. They have the most varied collection of menu just on Teas you will ever find anywhere else. Know about your Tea, you are about to have with their little details given with each in the menu. If not a tea person, it's a miss though, order your lattes and iced coffees at your will. (all beverages are top-class here). Then order, their Blue berry muffins or the choco-chip ones to fill your mouth with flavor and taste. Their Quiches are good to taste, their truffles are a delight. And if you are really hungry then you have their sandwiches and wraps to bite in and be happy.
You will love their decor if specially you are a bookworm. And am sure, you would like to visit Cha bar more than you ever would like to visit the regular CCDs and Baristas.

What's there not to like about a cafe on top of a book store? 
Perhaps the whole coffee shop+bookshop+good music combo makes this place perfect.
I usually visit Cha Bar whenever I'm waiting for friends at Park Street (who are VERY punctual).
The sandwiches are good. So is the apple pie. I love the lemonades to go along with my savories. 
Overall, its the perfect joint to catch up with some solitude.

The best combination in the world. Coffee and Books.. Situated atop the oxford book store, the cha bar gives u the perfect opportunity to dive into books along with good snacks and drinks. The cold coffee is nice and love the chicken nuggets as well. Do try the chicken quiche. The masala chai is good and is served in the small cutting chai cup as served in Mumbai, but with a twist. Have been there close to 10times and havent been disappointed..

Gorgeous location,great set up, cool ambience. Nothing can beat this. As for food I was disappointed with the dry unsubstantial Ham and cheese. It really tasted bad.
On the other hand a Yellow Tea with Pineapple and peach, was a delight. It was bursting with flavour and had something in it, that really made me happy!  I would recommend this if you are looking for a fun drink instead of a serious beverage. 
Cha bar is definitely a better place to meet people for a general chat. or just be by yourself than the often overcrowded coffee chains in the street. 
The service was prompt but they need to mellow down a bit on the whole approach of it. 

Nice place,

What better place to have your cup of tea than your local book store! A city obsessed with its masala chai courtesy balwant, sharmas and tea junctions, this place is a wonderful break from the routine. Sit down, sip on your fruit flavored tea or just go for some Assamese tea. You won't be disappointed.
P.S. Remember to take someone interesting to have a conversation with
If not, what the heck, who doesn't love books anyway

This is the best tea bar in the city. The best. I would love any one to come up with a better place. 

It has more than 100 varieties of tea at least. Every time I go there, I order an old favorite of mine or a new one. Each tea has a small description. You drink the tea, you savour the tea, you smell the tea, you feel glad such a place exists. 

I have known 'cha bar' from the time it was a 2 table place. They kept expanding the place. Now, almost 75% of the top floor of the iconic Oxford Bookstore at Park Street is the Cha Bar. 

One should never come here with 30 minutes to spare. The service is slow. There are a couple of waiters and some times you even have to call them for menu or to order an item. One should go here with an hour to two hours to spare. 

The place also has some very good sandwiches and muffins. There are other food items too like burgers and samosas. This place is exactly like a tea place in India should be - great tea, minimum but good food options for a quick bite and some nice desert to go with the tea. 

The prices are very reasonable, too. Plus, you can see people going through books in the books shop below. 

The seating isn't the greatest - you have chairs and not sofas and the like. I don't care. I absolutely LOVE the place. I keep going here once every couple of weeks or so when I am in the city. This is the place I go the most in the city. As long as they serve great tea, this will be my favourite tea spot in the city.

Me and my friend was planning to celebrate ‚ÄòRabindra Jayanti‚Äô in our own style. We finally decided to visit ‚ÄòCha Bar‚Äô on this occasion as its perfect combination of food & books. We were thinking to try fruit cake & ice cream combination but the guy behind the counter suggested ‚ÄòChocolate Truffle‚Äô & ‚ÄòBlack Current Truffle‚Äô. I ordered ‚ÄòHot Chocolate Truffle‚Äô & ‚ÄòBlack Current Truffle‚Äô along with ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô, ‚ÄòIced Mint Tea‚Äô & ‚ÄòLemonade Soda‚Äô.  First I tried Hot Chocolate Truffle with Vanilla Ice Cream, OMG ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just melted in my mouth. What a great flavour! It didn't over power each other and it wasn't too sweet. Black Current Truffle and Vanilla Ice Cream combo was also too good. But Hot Chocolate Truffle wins my heart. So we ended up getting that flavour along with the sweet vanilla ice cream and chocolate truffle. Everything was so good! Just loved the consistency, taste and the flavours.

Cha bar is a petite cafe located on the first floor of the oxford bookstore.The place is heaven for a foodie cum booklover.As you enter the bookstore you feel like youre in paradise.Stacks and stacks of books and stationaries!wow!And as you walk up the stairs to the first floor of the bookstore,cha bar welcomes you.The cafe is designed in an L shaped manner but there is ample seating, some overlooking the busy bookstore below.The chairs here look amazing but are a little uncomfortable.The place has been beautifully done  in tones of black and white, wooden flooring and looks very nice.The display is usually well stocked with pastries and other saviouries.The people behind the counter know what they are doing and are good at it :) There is a plethora of "chai" options and you are truly spoilt for choice.The sandwiches here are pretty good and so are the pastries.The chocolate truffle pastry is a perfect melt in your mouth and the apple pie is good too. 
It is usually quiet here and if you want a good book to read and want to grab a quick snack,step in here, for chai bar dosent disappoint.

The best place for quality tea and unlimited adda is not worth visiting anymore. Seems the management is not at all bothered.The service awful. They keep you waiting.....for taking orders serving the food or to bring the bill.If you have ample time then its the place for you. Now the food .The chicken asparagus quiche was stale,not fresh. Only the sandwiches are good and fresh.And tea off course. The Darjeeling second flush and Makaibari had no difference at all. Dolly's is a small place but its much better,homely and really good. Need to compare..And what tea Chai Bar serves seems to be Typhoo..This brand is not good to be polite. The place has deteriorated . Sad.

I would surely recommend the CHA BAR.

Cha Bar is my almost regular place in Calcutta.
Yes, I can never get bored of this place. EVER.

The smell of books, potpourri, the cards, the buzz, the hot coffee aroma wafting in the air and the light music score in the background gives you the best establishment in town : Oxford Bookstore.
Oxford Bookstore gives you another beautiful relaxing cafe : Cha Bar

With over 150 and more flavours of tea in stock, Cha Bar is a place to unwind over hot bru with friends or maybe lazily spend an afternoon with a book and coffee/tea by your side.
And the best part ? They do not bother you with anything.

I have tried quite a few stuff from their menu and hence here's my favourites :

Chicken and Mayo sandwich
Hand and Cheese sandwich
Assortment basket of fries
Chicken nuggets
Iced teas
Hot chocolate

This time, for a change I ordered their combo deal which provided me a sandwich of my choice, fries and a drink.
I chose to go with ham and cheese sandwich because I loved them last time.
Fries and hot chocolate to go alongside.

I was served four thick slices of ham and cheese sandwich which might seem edible at first, but then it is actually a lot of meat into the system so I ate two of them and packed the rest for later. The fries have a nice crunchy texture and has salt and pepper sprinkled on them.
Pleasure! :D

And lastly, I was not much expectant of the hot chocolate but it turned out to be pretty good. I  absolutely loved it.
I am generally not fond of combos, but this one took my heart.

Looking forward to more of combos, yaaay!
Will be back pretty soon.

Cheers! :D

Cha Bar has MANY fond memories and today as I again visited the place, I could recall every single one.
Cha Bar has always been my favourite hangout spot in Kolkata because I've been here innumerable times, chatted with friends over sips of cha, and snackers.
I heartily thank my mother for introducing me to Oxford Bookstore.
Sit with a book and a first darjeeling flush, and no one will bother to disturb you.
This is the typical feeling that I get every time I am here.
Here everyone is at their own pace and you can sit for long hours with a book or chat away merrily with your friends. The staff is amiable and do not shoo away people.
Ask for suggestions and they help. (Especially for their HUGE array of tea)

Today, I went for a small work discussion and ordered :

Chocolate Milkshake
Ham and cheese sandwich

The chocolate milkshake was nice and frothy and thankfully was not very cold. I liked it.
A discovery that I made today was the ham and cheese sandwich.I am a sucker for chicken and mayo but today, for a change I decided to order ham and I think I should have taken this decision long time back.
The ham and cheese was blended and trapped under two flat brown breads which were grilled to perfection.
Spot on.

Coming back in a week or two.
Cheers! :)



----- 22 Nov, 2013 -----

I have become a regular here. I at times wander around to Oxford to kill time among books and that is how I land up at Cha Bar.
Today, went there with friends because we had some work. Ended up gossiping there :P

We ordered the chicken and mayo sandwich and chicken nuggets.
Before, the chicken nuggets were served with ketchup, this time I saw it was served with kashundi.
And, it tasted really good :D

The chicken and mayo sandwich as usual was good. And, it always tastes better with the ketchup.

Cha Bar is a paradise for bookies like me and yes foodies too who love to read and eat. And, repeat the same :D

Cha Bar is a respite from the  gibberish world outside ANYDAY and EVERYDAY.

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! : )

After two days of incessant rain, I finally went out today to my favourite place :)

My friend was waiting over a cup of hot cappuccino in this chilly weather. However, I chose to remain loyal to my iced lemon tea and chicken nuggets.

The waiter had by mistake brought lemonade for me but after correction, very politely took it back and brought the desired drink for me. It tasted so chilly and so refreshing. I always prefer my tea chilled.

The chicken nuggets were well fried and crispy.  Very nice indeed. And the tangy  sauce tasted nice with the nuggets.
:)

Over all, a good experience.

Cheers!

Okay so I am writing about one of my favourite place in town. How I love this place :')
Cha Bar is located on the first floor of Oxford Book Store which is a gem of a gem!
The huge windows let you access the sight of the outer doldrums while you sit placidly inside enjoying a hot cuppa with a lovely novel.
It is best enjoyed during the rains :')
Staff is very friendly and offers suggestions too incase you're confused with the wide range of teas that they have.
Cha Bar is undoubtedly a book lover's paradise. Imagine the excitement of sipping hot tea with some fries and reading "Revolution Highway" or maybe "Emma" 
SO, I again visited this store today out of the love I have for it and as usual found myself swooning over books.

And I finally manage to order a Chicken and Mayo Sandwich, a Chicken and Asparagus Quiche and an Iced Lemon Tea.
The  latter was the best of the lot today. It was cool, refreshing and beating down on the already beating sun outside.

The chicken and mayo sandwich was good, with the sourness of the mayonise on the higher side, but the ketchup was the neutralizer. So, it was more or less fine. I liked it.

The biggest let down was the quiche. It was rather bland and dry and coarse and I cudnt even cut it properly with the knife. It looked delicious but I didnt know it would be this bad.
Knew that looks can be deceptive, however.  :(

But yes, that would definitely not stop me from going in there.
I totally LOVE Cha Bar.

Cheers! :)



----- 19 Feb, 2013 -----

Amazing refreshers..books..finger food. What else do u require? Kind of a second home for me. A lovely place to eat or sip and get engrossed in books or maybe a small chat with pals.

Ummm..the chicken and mayo sandwich is so very tummy filling! :)
Quantity is good enough. I also like the mint crush ice, the passion fruit tea and the mixed fruit tea.
They have a lovely ambience and you can spend hours and hours amongst books..lemonades n sandwiches without being bugged by the turbulent and dinning world outside :)
 A hot favourite of mine! ^_^

The Cha- Bar is a tea and accompaniment light snacks atop the Oxford Book store. The book store is a draw in itself and the delectable Tea Room adds to the attraction. They serve the best of tea available in the city and the Darjeeling varieties are mind blowing. The golden champagne hued Darjeeling in a rich porcelain cup is a sight in itself and the ambiance is just right. The staff are pretty attentive and caring and have an eye for detail and remembers your preferences if you are a near- regular. The menu card is very appropriate as it tells one a lot about the different teas and their specialities and characteristics. A good place to unwind with a book/magazine of choice and favourite tea for company.

Perfect place to chill out with your friends with a cuppa coffee, I.e. If you are not a book worm. Tell you what its just situated in the upper floor of oxford bookstore. Food is tad costly though and there better cafes that this that can offer the same thing cheaper.

I am a book lover, and I have often loitered around Cha Bar while browsing through books and looking for something to drink while I make up my mind about the purchases I would be making. That means, sitting there for a couple of hours with a cup of tea on the side. Although I am a coffee lover, I have opted for tea here more than often. 

The last visit was a couple of weeks back when I ordered a cup of cappuccino followed by a cup of ginger tea. The nice server took my order and brought each item to me within 10 minutes of placing the order each time. The cappuccino was not very strong, but tasted okay. They served my compatriot a sandwich - which he claimed was tasty. The tea came afterwards, and it was hot and smelling strongly of ginger, which I liked. Our bill was under 300/- for these three things, so we were pretty much happy with the food, if not overwhelmed.

Anyone who loves books in this city would probably have had visited this iconic bookstore on Park Street right beside the park hotel. Their little cafe has been there at least since 2003 or even further before that time. 

As the name suggests this is a tea-cafe more than anything else. At one point this was the most preferred place for anyone who did not want to burn a hole in their pocket.  The prices are still quite moderate and this is definitely a tea lover's haven. Now we all have our own preferences , be it any type of food item and I am sure there are many a people who like their tea milky , sweet and strong and then there are  those who prefer the mild taste of tea liquor  perhaps with just about a spoonful of milk or some other flavour this is a wonderful place. This cafe caters to both tastes with their wide variety of offerings. 

There is masala chai for the Indian at heart and the Darjeeling tea for the true tea-snob and the herbal tea for the health conscious or the organic tea for the environmentalist and the range of flavoured tea for the adventurous tea drinkers and then there are iced teas to cool anyone on a hot day. 

What sets it apart is the fact that they use freshly brewed tea instead of the tea-bags that most cafe's use and for any tea-lover the thought of tea-bags is a horror.  The tea is brewed perfectly. For the adventurous drinkers they have a wide range of tea with different flavours. 

Three chatty friends decided to catch up on hours of gossip while sipping on their respective iced teas, which all of them found perfectly brewed with the flavor of the tea along with the mild hint of the additional flavour. Two of us opted for the lime and lime zest flavour which was delciious. Our peachy friend liked her peach iced tea as well. 

On our numerous visits before I have usually stuck to their Darjeeling tea since I am a strict Darjeeling tea connoisseur and the tea seemed quite nice if not the best.  

In the Bengali language we usually have a cousin word called 'ta' (accompaniment with tea)  for the word 'cha' (meaning tea) and unfortunately the variety of accompaniments offered by this place is limited and what makes is worse is the unavailability of many items. Even from the section of desserts, the only available ones were the truffle slices and black forest slices. They had a few tea-cakes and their freshly baked aroma was tempting indeed. 

If not for anything else I would definitely recommend this place for its perfectly brewed tea. 

We noticed waffles being served on the table adjacent to ours but from the looks we felt it was too dry and over-cooked. 

This tiny little place tucked up in a quiet little bookstore done up in white is a lovely place to catch up with friends or to simply purchase a book and read it as long as one wants. 

P.S. They have these decorative colourful kettles with pictures on them which nicely jazzes up the place .

I always relate cha bar to dates rather than food! and that's mainly because I have had many memorable dates here but can hardly remember anything about the dishes/beverages they served. for me, the only reason I visit this place over barista out there is for the books and the quaint green benches on the side. the rest is pretty much forgettable.

Cha Bar is the heaven for tea lovers like me!!!!!!!

The city of Kolkata loves tea but one cannot generally get a tea other than the routine assam or darjeeling tea or the fruity flavours of typhoo tea. This small cafe located on the first floor of the Oxford Bookstore gives you such a wide variety of tea, that cannot be found elsewhere.

Reading pleasure through the wide collection of oxford over some amazing varieties of tea or coffee is a lethal combination for many. Sadly, i do not possess the divine reading habits, yet i love this place. The seats are big and comfortable.The music is really good with some very nice instrumentals  or pop numbers from justin timberlake playing most of the time. 

There is a very long menu of the various teas. it is one of the rare place in the city where you could get a kashmiri kawa. My favourite tea would be the ceylon tea served with fresh tea leaves and the aroma of the tea would instantly catch a big hold of you. Iced cafe latte is a basic simple cold coffee with ice cubes without any fuss. The eating options are limited and a bit overpriced. Paneer kathi roll or spinach quiche are decent to go along but not so spectacular. Warm apple cake with vanilla is good.

Pros:
1) Huge variety of tea, unlike anywhere else
2) NIce and comfortable place especially the seats
3) Great music

Cons:
1) Limited eating options at a bit high prices

Cha Bar is not just about tea nor just about sipping while you read but a complete and great cafe in itself !!!!!!!

My favourite place to sit back and relax over a cuppa whenever I am in Park Street area. A really nice departure from the CCDs and Baristas. Can't remember the number of times I have been there over the last couple of months. Amazing varieties of tea, cosy ambience, friendly waiters. And if you are a book lover, this place is a heaven for you, as you take in the smell of newly printed pages of a book while sipping your cha. This place is great on the finger food options too. I would wholeheartedly recommend the dessert teas, especially the chocolate hazelnut and the creme caramel, besides the regular earl greys and masala chais. If you like an overbearing taste of clove in your tea, be sure to go for the 'truck drivers ki 100 mile wali chai'. The sandwiches are tasty and filling. I have tried the roast chicken and mayo and the ham and cheese ones. The chicken nuggets are the ready-to-fry packaged variety. The chicken and asparagus quiche bursting with the filling and melts in your mouth. To end the meal, I prefer their chocolate chip muffins, served warm and yummy. And all these while you run through the pages of the next book you are contemplating buying, or while you are leisurely reading through the first chapter of the one you just bought. A place I would surely go back to again and again.

Located inside the Oxford Book Store, this was once a cyber-cafe but now it's only a cafe though you can use your own device here if you're not into books. A calm & relaxed place to spend time on your own or with friends, it's expensive though.

Went to Cha Bar yesterday. Single, with friends, with family I think this is one of the places one should visit in Kolkata. Fabulous is the word... You usually dont get such a wide selection of teas anywhere under one roof.. I wish i could sip each one of them...In a phase of economy where we have suddenly turned to a coffee loving nation Cha Bar is heavens for tea lovers. Food is fabulous. Perfectly flavoured ingredients make my taste buds tickle. In short had a enjoyable eve.

The idea of a cosy cafe nestled in a bookstore in park street serving tea, cakes, sandwich is splendid. To be able to go through books with a friend,sipping their ice tea along with it makes up a marvelous afternoon. You can spend hours here reading books and having a nice conversation over a cup of tea. 
The downside - its expensive. You might want to leave the store and visit the numerous eateries in park street if you're hungry.

Cha Bar, in my opinion represents everything that is wrong with the city. It is pretentious, prices are expensive and leaves you with a "I have just been cheated" rage after you finish your tea.

It is the only place where you feel sleepy AFTER drinking tea. The brews are weak, watery and you feel unsatisfied. 

Cell phone reception is erratic. So, if you are waiting for someone's phone call, keep on waiting..

This place combines two of my most favorite things .... books and food : ) With winter coming nothing beats a warm cup of their "first flush" Darjeeling tea (without milk please) or the "orange" fruit tea washed down with a ham and cheese sandwich or a plate of bhajjia pakoras while pouring over a few books ..... my idea of heaven ! In the summers I would recommend the Lemon and Lime Zest Iced Tea which is crisp and refreshing or the Mint Iced Tea.

This is my to-go place when i am low. 
THE best selection of tea in the city. i am wondering why nobody rated it yet. 
the hibuscus tea remains my favorite and i love their iced teas too. the staff in warm and does not pester u to leave, and the ambiance is simply adorable. 

i can spend hours here and simply never get bored. 

perfect place for a lazy afternoon tea.
