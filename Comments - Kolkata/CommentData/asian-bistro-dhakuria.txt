just few metres away from my house... no seating and only take away or delivery..really good stuff... gotta stick to the Chinese stuff only! garlic chicken has become my favorite..for the aroma and rich garlicy texture... I've never been a big fan of spelling errors in menu but i don't mind their errors, as long as the dishes taste the way they do!!

Had no idea that Selimpur had such a nice eatery.Pass this counter daily while going to and returning from work. It was just yesterday that we decided to order from here.Have to say was absolutely taken aback by the food. Excellent taste. Ordered Hakka Chow, Hot Garlic Chicken, Dry Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken and Gravy Chicken Chow. Each tasted exceptional. We were all taken aback by the quality of the food, the taste and surprisingly at such reasonable prices. Must try for all. I can vouch for the fact that this is one of the best take away joints in this locality.

Asian bristo is located near selimpur,dhakuria. Staright down the selimpur pally pujo. Recently opened fast food joint with good food and service. 

Home delivery takes a little time. Quantity and quality of food goes well with the price.

In the begining they used to make pastas which was worth the price and quality. But now they have stopped

Some of the must try is their chilli fish,manchurian chicken and hakka noodles.

This place is very near to my house and it is a takeout that is perfect for fairly regular eating out. The low price guarantees an absolutely wonderful taste. The Chinese especially is pretty good. Some of my favourites include the fried rice, chilli chicken, Hong Kong chicken, fish fry.

Seating maybe in a mess but the food is fantastic. Must tries at first day visit crystal chicken, the soya roll, and the pan fried momo. Value for money. You will love the Hong Kong chicken, chicken in oyster sauce, the orange chicken and of course the kung pao chicken. It's all the same with a twist, that will make frequent this place. Photo s coming soon.
