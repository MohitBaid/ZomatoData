It's a wonderful concept and just a call away from delivering some of the most delicious as well  beautifully designed cakes i have seen in recent times.

Great place....i love the fruit cakes....perfect with your morning tea..Healthy and pocket friendly...

I like the home delivery concept...With festivals coming up...all you need to do is take your phone place the order and you have it at your place next day.
