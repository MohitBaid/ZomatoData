Bhojohori Manna is famous for its bengali cuisines. We went there for a family dinner on 1st jan. The food was delicious but service was very poor. The tables were not clean. We ordered mini thali, dhania chicken and mutton dakbangla. Not a single dessert item was available yesterday ( except mishti doi which was there with the thali ).

Food was pretty good but probably the rash behaviour of the staffs resulted into poor ratings. We went for a Saturday lunch and was pretty disappointed at first as the waiter was discouraging us by saying many of the items in the menu were unavailable. Half heartedly we started with foul cutlet and Bhetki roll. Both the starters were tasty, especially the Bhetki roll had delicious filling. Next we opted for the maxi thali which contained : rice, shukto, Moog daal, jhuri aloo bhaja, chanar kofta curry, one small bowl of polao, chutney, papad, Mishti doi and pithe. Alongside that we ordered one mutton duckbangla. We wanted to had one fish item but every dish contains one piece of fish which felt unnecessary expensive. The amount of offering of this thali was sufficient for two of us after the starter. The chanar kofta was extremely tasty, a nice surprise indeed. The mutton gravy was very tasty also. At the end we had one rabdi also which is a favourite of partner. Pocket pinch was moderate for the meal.

This was my second visit to this place. Was really disappointed. We odered kofta , pulao, rice and Chicken dak bungalow. The koftas were good, but there wasn't any gravy. The quantity of the pulao and rice were really very less and Chicken felt like yesterday cooked.
The staffs are good but confused.
The decorum is nice. But food not worth the money.

The Dish which you want is fortunate get.Any dish you want there is not available.I don't like that . As in Diamond Plaza ,multiplex the restaurant should be more careful about availability of dishes.There are high service tax and Including vat they want more tips.Inspite of all this I ordered Bangali polao and all .That was average good.The Bengali theme in plate I love in all these.

Don't know why BM is underrated, but after having two of its dishes namely Katla Kalia and Mutton Egg Dakbanglow , my opinion about BM has been in the positive side, as BM never compromises with the quality and quantity of its dishes. Both the dishes were yummy and fresh. Am definitely bookmarking BM for ordering above mentioned dishes next time. Kudos BM and keep up the good work. ‚úåüëåüëçüëåüëå

Was here on the eve of Doshomi this year. As usual found the place crowded. Had to wait for 45mins to get a seat for us. But that 45mins didnt go in vain as we could relish the authentic bengali cuisine. The prices of the dishes were average. The seating area was bit small and crowded.

Not being a resident of Kolkata, i wanted to cherish some authentic bengali food. So, i was here. I would like to specially recommend the kobiraji and the bhapa ilish. The Bhapa Ilish was boneless and something that made me lick my fingers and i mean literally. Amazing dish and i would specially recommend this to be tried for a non bengali and non kolkata based folks.

I used to be a fan of Bhojohori Manna until I visited this outlet in Diamond Plaza. The quantity of food is less for the price and they don't really taste that good.I'm not sure if this is the case with the other outlets too but my earlier experience with the other branches were great.

I have been here for lunch during Puja 2017. Ambience is average. Staff behaviour was good.

As far as the food is concern; bheti kobiraji was awesome but the salad served with it was poor. Chanar dalna was average and the quantity of gravy was extremely low. A person can't even have one roti with it. Mutton kosha's taste was good however the quality of mutton was worse. I can't even chew that. Alu bhaja could have been better with curry pata and peanuts. Rice quality was also not upto the mark.

Not at all value for money. Not recommended.

Had a craving for authentic Bengali cuisine for some days and landed up in bhojohori manna, tried and tested and total value for money. I had tried the other outlets but it was my first at Diamond City‚Äã. Was totally and utterly disappointed. Most of the dishes were unavailable and those that were, came to the table after ages, as the service speed was pathetic. The taste was okay. However the behavior of the waiters was not quite up to the mark. Would not recommend this outlet. If you want to try this restaurant out, better go to sector five or gariahat.

This place is a disgrace for Bhojohori Manna. There are many other places where you can try Bengali food if you're here as a tourist. Places like Oh! Calcutta, Machaan, 6th Ballygaunge Place wouldn't let you down. 

This bhojohori manna will make you compromise with both quality and quantity.

Worst experience. I didnt understood on what basis you charged 525 (excluding gst) for rice with dal and sabzi, that too undercooked and tasteless. which am sure wouldn't have took you more than 50rs to 70rs to make the full meal. Very disappointed after paying a big amount of bill. You deserve minus rating, doesnt even worth 1.

"Is it really a branch of Bhojohori manna!!" that was my first reaction when I got my lunch served here.
Since I started using zomato, I always read review of the restaurant befor visiting but on that day after watching a movie in PVR Diamond plaza me and my friend were very hungry so we visited this one situated just opposite to PVR without reading any review. 
It was indeed a bad decision.
Price of the dishes was comparatively higher ( May be due to Durga pujo season, I don't know.) Quantity was low.
PANCHMESALI TORKARI: though it contained huge amount of oil, vegetables like cauliflower, and pumpkin were undercooked. Quantity was less.

PARSHE MACH: I did not like the taste. 

DHOKAR DALNA: Disappointing.

In spite of poor quality and less quantity price is high.
Not recommended.

Bhojohori Manna. Servs you the worst food exprience in kolkata. With 525/- + gst, you get 2 very big scoop of rice, but only few teaspoon of dal, half a small bowl of cauliflower vegetable. And the chanar dalna( bengali cottage cheese) is more maida than milk solids. 800/- +gst gives you unchewable mutton and chutni ( refer picture) they will give you enough rice only, but nothing on the side dish to savour it.

Food that cost between 50 to 100 inr are served at 100 % more the markup with bad taste and really small portion that keeps you hungry.

Pathetic is the only word which comes to my mind. Food quality and service both are poor. Worst ever experience in a bhojohori manna branch. The staff were in no mood of serving or take order. They seemed like dead people walking around. I have visited the other branches too but never had such horrible experience. It was a total waste of time and money. I would like to recommend people not to visit this branch.

I have been to their another outlet and they were good to me as well as i liked the food. After i heard about this branch i visited with decent expectations but they left me with awful experience.

Food 6 out of 10 ( as a bengali i will go to a bengali resturent expecting food which i don't eat at home or if i eat so it should be better than what i eat regularly. Ordered basanti polau and 2/3 veg and nonveg sides. The foor was cold from the first spoon)

Serviece 0 out of 10 (now comes the worst part. I don't know the guys were experienced or not but they are moving around in front of you all the time for no reason. Orderd two polaos which was given into one bowl. How more unprofessional you can be?)

Ambience 6 out of 10 (it was decent when it comes to decor or the tables. Nothing to catch your eye but not bad as well.)

In a competitive market, you got to at least serve what your menu offers. Most of the items weren't available. From what was, we had black pepper chicken kabab, polao, chhanar dalna, mutton kosha and rabri. The taste was good, but not better than 6 Ballygunj Place (a la carte) or Sholo Ana Bangali. The only redeeming quality was that they accept Sodexo. I would probably visit again, if I don't have cash and I want to pay with Sodexo.

Ordered some items directly from restaurant. Prawn kabiraji cutlet was a disaster at high price. Quantity of one vegetable was very low. Mutton kosha undercooked, not tasty. Even steamed rice was not good. Very disappointed after paying a big bill amount. I have eaten numerous times at their other joints in sector 5, gariahat, ruby industrial estate,hazra but then all food were good and some were very good. This joint should stop doing business, they are continuously misguiding people who love to eat.l shall never contact them in future.

Utterly disgusting restaurant! Wanted to order Mutton Dak bungalow, Boneless Mutton Korma & Pabda curry to be delivered at our home. Initially they said Mutton Korma is not available so we were compelled to order Mutton Dak bungalow only. After few minutes we got a call saying, even that was not available so we had to change it to Mutton Kosha. 
Now coming to the taste- it had nothing but chilli, chilli & only chilli!! No flavour at all. Felt like throwing it up. And the quantity was not sufficient for even one person. And the Pabda curry was priced at Rs. 165 for one fish (thats bit too expensive given the standard of the restaurant).
I seriously wish Zomato had an option of negative rating because this restaurant doesn't even deserve rating 1.

First of all, 80% of the items in the menu were not available. We ordered 1 posto bora, 2 bangali pulao, 1 chicken dakbangla & 1 mutton dakbangla. The quantity of 2 pulao equals to 1 pulao serving, which is very disappointing. When we ordered for 1 more pulao they said pulao was no longer available. The size of posta bora was too tiny for the price. Moreover, they served only 2 pieces.  It tasted gross. It was such a nice waste of money. The taste of the pulao, chicken & mutton were good, but I am highly disappointed with the quantity served. The ambience was nice. Service was okay. Not visiting here again. üëé

Being a non bengali food lover, I was a bit sceptical about visiting this place but to my utter delight the place was really amazing. We ordered Rice, Cholar Dal, Alu bhaja, Ilish Mach, Chitol Peti, Chicken Jhol and Mishti Doi. And the fish pieces were humongous in size and equally delicious as said by my father and uncle aunty, who really relished it. Chicken was tender and the Mishti doi was really flavourful. 
The service was really quick, the servers really pleasant and continuously ready to help serve the food, pull chairs and are polite and smiling.
I will recommend this place to everyone, who wants to spend a nice relaxing time with their family.

If you are looking for a good bengali food for lunch or dinner, this is one of the fine options that you should consider.

Sunday it was. Had a plan for family lunch. Entered Bhojohori Manna, Diamond Plaza. And then‚Ä¶ TADAAA !!

Okay without wasting time let‚Äôs pen it.

Ambience: When you enter the restaurant after ordering the food and even after posting check-in over Facebook, if you have time you look around and then the ‚Äòambience‚Äô comes in place. It‚Äôs so so actually. Considering other outlets, it‚Äôs okay! No issue with AC; no issue with sitting arrangements either, at least when we visited.¬† For Ambience- 3*/5 .

Food: I am a vegetarian. Don‚Äôt get shocked please. We ordered Veg Thali mini which (generally) consists of ‚ÄòLuchis,Rice/Polao, Aalu bhaja, Chanar dalna, Alur dom, Cholar Dal, Chatni, Papad Misti doi‚Äô. Now this is usual one but when we visited they informed that they were running out of Luchi (like seriously?). No worries! They servered Rice instead of Luchi and Polao (White ghee-Rice with cashews and raisins) was there too. For non-veg members we ordered ‚ÄòMutton Duck Banglo‚Äô and one item of ‚ÄòVetki‚Äô. We asked for Mocha with Chingri ‚Äì They said ‚Äúno‚Äù. We asked for ‚ÄòJumbo Hilsa‚Äô ‚Äì They said ‚Äúno‚Äù. Now it was that moment when someone usual say ‚Äòjoh bhi hain wohi le‚Äôaao aap‚Äô. None of us were able to have that ‚ÄòChanar Dalna‚Äô as it was a bit sour! ‚ÄòCholar Dal‚Äô and ‚ÄòChatni‚Äô was really delicious. They will serve you ‚ÄòMisti doi‚Äô too.
Now here comes another key point! If you are lucky enough you might be severed ‚ÄòMisti doi‚Äô with extra added ‚Äòhair‚Äô! Cool nah? But when informed (reported) then they stated: ‚ÄòNo, you aren‚Äôt today‚Äôs lucky customer. We will change the ‚ÄòMisti doi with extra added hair‚Äô.
That broke our heart and we didn‚Äôt wish to continue the lunch anymore.
For Food: Taste: 3*/5. Quantity: 4*/5.

Price: Considering the item names it was fine but considering the quantity and quality it doesn‚Äôt deserve that hike! It was around 1850+ for 4 including GST. 

Wrapping up: Service was good if I don‚Äôt consider ‚ÄòMisti doi with extra added hair‚Äô. Check in the restaurant one but in other outlets.¬† I visited other outlets and they were much better! BTW they didn‚Äôt even serve basic anise or paan-masala!

For me it‚Äôs: 1.8*/5 considering food (taste and quantity), ambience, service etc.

Most of the dishes are not available. Whatever is available they r super sweet which does not suit the tastebuds. And you have to wait for a hour or more after reserving a table but what got me mad is that even though if a table is empty for 3 or 4 person's to sit & outside if a family of 3 or say 4 person r waiting they are not letting in.

To begin with this outlet is located in diamond plaza , nagerbazar .Decor is standard in line with ¬†their other branches thou congested . Now ¬†food part ....i had ordered for mini thali , chanar kofta and lotey macher galouti but sadly they said they are unable to serve ¬†these ¬†as they are out of these item and also the food is not prepared in this outlet but they receive it from their main branch . Hence i ordered ¬†mutton chop, bhetki kobiraji, rice, postor bora, mutton dakbunglow and morolar chocchori . Bhetki kabiraji was amazing to taste ( could have actually eaten another it was that tasty .....too filing ). Mutton chop ( nice keema filing , not piled with potato ) , posto bora and dak bunglow was as usual good but nothing extra ordinary .But morola mach was bad both the taste and the quantity. But will definitely visit again as i am from this area and hope they have all the items in menu :) .

Come to the food... Half of the things were unavailable... paneer kofta was too hard to break... And service was like no one were willing to serve us... They were watching women's world cup...

I have ordered a few items from this restaurant m first they called me to say one particular item was not available. I changed it. When the food was delivered the changed item was not also delivered. When i called them they first tried to deny, then said they would send the missed item shortly. After sometime they called and said this item was not available and said they'd deliver it next say morning. This was a harassment at 10 in the night. And it's very unprofessional behaviour from the restaurant. Recommend all to think twice before ordering from this restaurant in future.

Eating at Bhojohori Manna comes with some expectations. When I had dined at another outlet of this restaurant in the year 2007 or so , I was thrilled by the quality of food. Sadly it has deteriorated over the years. When the outlet at Diamond Plaza opened its door to the public, I went with high expectations. It was January I suppose. Had lots of expectations but they weren't fulfilled. The fish roll was small compared to the price nor was the stuffing sufficient. The Mutton Kosha was too simple in taste lacking the flavour it is supposed to have and above all the meat was undercooked. The Basanti pulao wasn't anywhere near what its supposed to be visually but tasted fine. The jumbo prawn malai curry was very good. The size of the prawn was perfect and the taste of the gravy was up to the expectations. Thank God I had ordered it else the experience would have been all the more bitter. Decor is good. 2/5
Expecting lot of improvement in the future.

Being a die hard fan of Bengali Cuisine, Bhojohari Manna has always been one of my favourite places to savour my taste buds. But for the Diamond Plaza outlet that's where it stops.
1stly half the items on the menu list weren't available.  Not only overpriced(a fact we overlook), but like the downside to any experience, the service n food! Yuck!!
The chicken was bland. Chutney (my fav item)had me  heartbroken. Was served water or chutney?? Still in a fix..one staff was however helpful. The ambiance was well jut ok..
So my advice.. If u really want to enjoy bengali food visit their Saltlake or Gariahat outlet..but stay far away from the Diamond Plaza one..
To sum up it was culiniraly insipid.

I rate other outlet of Bhajohari Manna more than 7 but for this I'll give less. The quantity served was less. Ordered 3 plates & they put it in a single bowl & said this is the quantity. Quality of Rice/Dal is also not good enough compare to others though they claimed they prepare it in a single kitchen for all outlates. Service is average.

Mutton dakbangla with egg, pure home made preparation, with less amount of oil. Its yumm when you have this with steamed rice.. 
Mochar ghonto is another lovely item with silver coconut sprinkled on it..

I've tried the ballygunge and salt lake ones long before but this time it's a disappointment. The quantity is extremely less and costly too!!
And taste is so different these days here. 
Very disappointed. And most importantly the tables are so small.

The interior is really beautiful and gives you the right feel while satisfying your craving for some authentic bengali food indulgence.
Visited this place to order for some take away.
I had to wait for approximately 40 minutes to get my order ready.I ordered for a fish gravy and Chingri Malai Curry. The bill was around Rs 550.
Both the dishes were average in taste.
The price of the dishes is too much compared to the quality.

We ordered mutton dakbungalow, Bengali pulao and laccha paratha. The taste of all three combined together was not much to my satisfaction compared to what I have had in the other outlets of this restaurant. To say the least, if you visit Daimond Plaza, perhaps this is the best place for trying out Bengali cuisine‚Äã.

"Bhojohori Manna"
A very well known place for the taste of Bengali Food!
Although this outlet is a new one but the dishes served here will not let u downüëçüèº
Well,this outlet is located on the top floor of the mall Diamond Plaza which is in the north side of the city.
On 4th of this month I went to this place with a hungry tummy though it was Sunday n the reatau was crowded but we easily got a table for two.
I must say the place is very clean n stuff was courteousüôÇ
Coming to food finally wch was the best partüòÄ
I crave for hilsa,I definitely had tht it tasted awesome.Our order was Steemed rice,Jhuri Aloo bhaja,Cholar Dal,Hilsa shorshe begun r jhol,Chicken Dak Bungalow(their specialty).We didn't have any dessert cause we were already tummy tightüòÄ
As it is nearby to my house now will definitely come over again.
Thank you.

I have been to the other branches of the restaurant and this particular branch does not hold a candle to the others. Rather it is putting a sham on the name and quality that the restaurant franchise holds.
I went to this place few months back, almost 70% of the food in the menu is not available, I planned to eat dab Chingri which is my favourite in this restaurant on other branches but is was not available. I ordered Vasmati Polau and Boneless Mutton Korma, While the food was ok, but oily. I was shocked at the difference in quantity in comparison to other branches. We were served food like someone has taken half off the plate. Putting that aside, the reason for which I am providing a negative review is the fish which is supposed to be damn good in this outlet. I ordered Vetki Kalia [all other fish items were unavailable], They served a below poor quality fish with watery soup like curry. It was not edible. When I complained about the fish, the staff said they cook it like this only. Later I ordered the famous Nolen gurer Ice Cream which is my favourite. The 2 rating is for the Ice cream. Anyways Never again. I would rather suggest people to visit Kasturi Restaurant just opposite of diamond plaza which is literally 10 times better than this restaurant.

Poorest of all the Bhojohori Manna outlets I have visited.
Extra oily food which tasted a little stale as well. The Basmati Pulao which we had ordered was unnecessarily sticky. The ghee/butter/oil used was way too much. Fish provided did not taste well at all.

Staff was too lousy and incompetent. 

Expectations were pretty high, but we were hugely let down.

In case you are planning to visit Bhojohori Manna, pick another outlet.

Went for lunch today. Food quality ranged from pretty average to awful. The rice served was not even close to fine grade and there was no option for another variety even if you are willing to pay extra for that. The Vetki fish was served straight from cold storage and I could not have it beyond one bite as the fish was already rotten. Complained this to the server and received a clod shoulder in response. The servers did not know how to serve, their fingers and hands were getting drenched with daal, rice, curry while serving. Not going back there even if the food is offered for free .

Went there a few days back.. Horrible experience. Very very bad management. The food neither carries some special taste nor it has the authentic bengali taste. It can be good for them who are tasting the bengali food for the first time, but not for those people who are used to bengali cuisine. Now coming to the management, they were forcefully increasing the queue. We went in 2 pax. So we had to wait until a two persons table gets vacant. As we were determined that we would taste their food, we waited there for such a long time. Both for management as well as food, this restro is absolutely not recommended. We had to stand for 1 hour and after that they allowed shared tables.

Bhojohori manna is a name I can trust upon when I crave for authentic Bengali food and when they open their outlet near my home (diamond plaza, nagerbazar) ,all I need is an excuse to visit d outlet. So today finally I went there for d lunch.it was hot summer day and I did not want to upset my stomach by offering d whole menu .so I stick to d pretty basics: gondhoraj ghol, bketki roll,basanti pulao, jumbo chingri Malai curry , illish paturi, mutton kasha ,chatni, papad, Misti doi and rajbhog. They served us really big prawns with d tastiest gravy I hv tasted in a Bengali restaurant. The ilish paturi ,though disappointed me. D size and taste of d ilish was not up to d mark .other food items r really delicious.the service was excellent and I can't wait to try their other items from the menu.

1)Pathetic menu, no food choices since none was available.. had to choose something (since I'm a vegetarian).. What I had was pathetic again.. Every penny spent was spent for nothing.. Gross.. 
2) Service of a chai stall on a Monday morning is better than this very very reputed and most favoured Restaurant chain.. Staffs lacked decency, they lacked a sense of hospitality.. The management was invisible to me to complain.. Very very disappointed..

Nutshell: Spend your money wisely by not visiting Bhojohari Manna!! Every penny is worth a thousand Dollars.. Value It!

In the year 2017, am i missing something? Is the word "Vegetarian food" obsolete? Or am i to believe that if a restaurant claims to serve both vegetarian and non vegetarian food, it's secretly saying "No, we'll only serve non veg"?
People went in this restaurant with joy and hope in their heart knowing they'll soon taste some good-ol' vegetarian cuisine. But what they didn't know was that, on this day, all they'll taste is 'Dissapointnent'. All their happiness and eagerness to eat some good vegetarian food to alleviate their hunger came crashing down. Sadness was palpable in that restaurant. Everyone knew something sinister had just happened. I sure would love to give a dictionary to them so that they can differentiate between Veg and Non veg.
In summary, there were no Vegetarian food in this establishment. Even though there was supposed to be.

So these guys probably like the sound of a dishe's name and decide to include it in their menu, is it? Next, the quality, o my god, such outrageously filthy food?? Taste? At your own risk, friend. This restaurant must be booked under section 420 of the IPC. Disgusting.

If a menu includes both veg and Non veg cuisine, the customer would naturally expect to have the independence of choosing anything that comes under the menu. Having ordered veg, we had to choose between options of just three dishes amongst some variety present in the menu. Never expected such poor service from a restaurant we once celebrated,cherished having in town. Sad !

We visited this place on a weekend lunch with family.  It is not the 1st time though. I have visited other branches in past.  I specifically like their postor bora,  mutton duckbunglow,  nolen gurer ice cream.  The pulao is also good.  I enjoyed their chitol peti as well. This time the chingri malaikari seemed distinctly bland and tasteless. Being a bengali myself,  i am too sensitive about bengali cuisine.  So i will always say things could have been better,  keeping in mind the price they charge on a dish.  It was a bill of 3k for 5 of us.

They served food in thermocal plates which is not expected from a 5 star Restraurant. They served two medium sized prawns, under cooked mutton kosha ,one piece Hilsa and very less ppl pulao. In desert they served one spoon chutney and one rassogolla... Service was pathetic and they never repeated any item even claiming thalis are unlimited.
Trust me it's not worth visiting. Very sad

What a shame! Today we visited here and the waiting time was unknown. I asked a person who was available from management about the estimated waiting time. He said how should he know and this completely depends upon the people who are eating inside!! After 3 hours of waiting they started offering shared table. I waited with my family for 3 hours 10 mins , and then we were too hungry that we had to leave the branch and we ate somewhere else. All though they were not offering A la carte only thalis...I didn't like the overall experience. I called the branch for 7 times before going but no one picked up the call. I like Bhojohori manna but today's experience changed my mind.

They didnt give us any spoon..not even one with which we would serve the dishes for ourselves..on asking for one the waiter just picked up one spoon from a table next to us with the customer still on the table...he dint even bother to enquire whether the customer has even used that spoon nd handed it over to me..had to wait 20mins fr the food to arrive another 15 mins only fr the bill..i am really suprised by this kind of worthless staff..
Coming to the food...we orderd basanti pulao mutton kosa nd jumbo prawn malai curry..costing us 807rs..the food was perfctly cookd..tasted brilliant.. The only reason i may go bck to the restaurant is the food.. im highly disappointed with the waiters..the place is small bt nicely decorated

Instead of serving thala wise they mix up all together that surely reduce the quantity altogether. Which is the total mess. Some dishes are not upto the mark with other outlets.  Though the behaviour of staff are very polite,  but I am not happy with the food quantity and serving style.

A small outlet and very small portions of food. The size of the bowl of mutton kosha almost got me crying. The miniature baked rosogolla wouldn't be harmful to a diabetic even. As they say in Bengali "pet patla loker jonno thik ache". Also, none of the dishes were extraordinary in taste. The place is not expensive though. However for true foodies this place is a one time visit. The other Bhojohori Manna outlets are no doubt much better than this one.

I am a BIG FAN of this restaurant, but last night what I experienced was horrible & irritating too, waited long outside for a parcel of "Mutton dakbanglo". When i opened it not a single piece of Mutton was intact it was kind of shreded pieces, Gravy quality was also  Like any street food center (mutton kosha) .. I mean really u just can't serve any one anything because it's your last order !!! If you can't provide a quality food please don't take orders.... We just pay the extra penny for your "quality" nothing else. I really have to give a second thought whether to visit again or not

I though then may be some rush was there so this unpleasant experience I have faced. So I went their again on a normal day as it has a good brand name. On 2nd day I faced more bad experience . They took around 50 minutes to serve the starter only & whenever I have asked to the waiters about it then they just misbehaved with me. It is very disappointing that a restaurant with a good brand name just spoiling the customers special dine out experiences

Bhojohori Manna newly opened in diamond plaza mall(5th floor) which is very near to my home.Reaturant decoration is very nice,looks like you will be in some typical traditional home.

Now comes to the purpose of coming here which is for having good food.But i am very much disappointed by food.I have ordered vetki rongpuri fry and kandahari kabab.For vetki preparation fish is fresh but i didnt find the proper justification of the recepie name.And kandahari kabab is like typical mutton kabab,same like previous one recepie-improper justification of name.Even mutton is not fully boiled.

Service also very poor.They are engaged in giving parcel orders.

Rate for the recepie is high as per they provided food such as for example vetki rongpuri fry,which is typically fish fry.

Rating:
Resturant ambience - 7/10
Service - 3/10

Price as per recepie- 3/10

Food quality-2/10(very poor)

Note :- If you no work to do,you can go there for onetime.Otherwise PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE....

Heard about bhojohori manna for a long time but couldn't fathom to go there coz most of the outlets are far away from my home but since the opening of this branch inside this mall almost a walking distance calls for rejoice indeed 

Now for decoration it was neat clean and looked fresh 
The food we ordered 

Veg thalis consist or 
Rice
Pulao
Dal 
Chhanar dalna
Alu bhaja
Shukto
And side item of mutton dakbunglow
With chutney,papad,rajbhog and mishti doi for dessert 

Making it a complete package of meal

And the staffs were efficient and the soo was food which had got a new fan of their food indeed

And we would love to visit again and try other meals as well

Bhojohori Manna is a legend in Bengal. Needa no introduction or review. However this outlet is a relatively small one and  is located just beside the pvr complex in diamond plaza mall itself...gets crowded... So service becomes a serious issue during peak time.... Otherwise... Neat tidy and very good.

It's located beside PVR and the place is quite specious as compared to other branches of this restaurant. Taste wise foods are too good but the problem is quantity is very less as compared to price. They served 3 pieces of mutton which were quite small in mutton dakbangla also the egg was missing in the dish. But took the full 210rs for that. Most of the items from the menu was not available which was really annoying. Hopefully they will improve their service in future. Would like to visit this place another time just because of the food which was really tasty.

Went today with my family for lunch.There was a small line outside.we had to wait for 15 minutes.That was not at all a problem for us but when we entered,it was really really disappointing 90% of items was not available for lunch.So we had to order simple things like-rice,dal,alu and macher dimer bora,chicken daak-banglow,chatni and papad. 2 months ago we went to the Puri outlet.The service was flawless and fabulous the food was yummy.
This particular joint should have opened with proper planning not before that.Food was okay.Hope to see better service soon.

The quantity was very less considering the price chart. Most of the items were not available. The place was strangely vacant in a Sunday evening, then also they goofed up our order. We were served a chicken dish instead of mutton. Later we were actually thankful that we were served chicken as the mutton pices from another dish (mutton korma) was old and almost spoiled and smelling. The polao was sticky however the taste was good. Same goes for the Chhanar Dalna. Service was alright. I am never going to visit the place again and won't recommend.

Why so low rate? Well food quality is not bad but very less in quantity. But the worst part of this joint is the pathetic service. I was forced to starve because of this. Firstly the items mentioned in the menu most of it are not available. You will get only one chicken item from all 12 one mutton from all 10. They are clueless as well about the availability. At first u will be asked to wait to check the availability then no one will come, after repeated follow up a person will show you the kindness to mention that. So after struggling for 30 minutes, I was able to place my order. Then was waiting for another 20 minutes finally the food arrived but so less in amount I have to order some more. But alas even a roti will take more than 40 minutes. It was already 10 pm and can someone wait so much? Even if I go to a grocery shop and after buying raw materials start cooking it will take less than that. Even for the billing I was waiting for more than 20 minutes. So the end result is half eaten, after spending almost 2 hours. It doesn't end there you also will be asked to adjust the seat with new customers as they are waiting. I could finish it within an hour but If this is the turn around time obviously a long que of customers will be there.

Located beside pvr theatres,above the food court level!!! 
This just not a restaurant but a name when it comes to bengali cuisine in kolkata but I just they could maintain their standards when I first saw the advertisement about this restaurant I don't know why but I presumes it won't be that great as I've tried the star theatre branch quite a few times where I've seen them getting deteriorated,day by day.

Coming to the decor it's good,nothing exceptional but as there name suggests it has the touch of the authenticity of bengal,moreover one can expect a splash of white!!! 

Some of the waiters were welcoming whereas the other's were arrogant,they don't follow the instructions well!!!! 
Now about the kitchen,which is a negative thing as you can hear everything they are talking about while sitting there quite loud,and crack jokes among them which isn't wrong but one can clearly hear all these and as customer one won't like to have an ambience like this whole dining out!!!!  
Now the most important part that is the serving time and the quality of the food,they are quite delayed as we had to wait for quite a lot of time,now the taste which was very average though the presentation was better,we had fish kabiraji which was not something to go gaga about as we have many other and famous traditional outlets where one can get better kabiraji's so when it comes about the competition they lag far behind,along with that we had bhetki fish roll which was so soury which i guess was because of the fish as it wasn't fresh I guess when we said about that they replied as it's the recipe,so we didn't argue nor did we eat it and they serve raw carrot cucumber and onion which tastes and looks like they peel and cut them before quite a few hours so we couldn't eat that too as it wasn't fresh at all!!!

Still one of the waiter was well behaved with a big smile,that made us feel the place is still warm!!!

Its located on the topfloor of diamond plaza mall next to pvr. Its nicely decorated and very spacious compared to the other bhojohori manna outlets. 
We opted for fish fry and chicken cutlet. Both the items were very tasty and nicely presented. 
The service was quite slow , but that could be becoz we were there around 7.30 pm and they were getting ready for dinner service. 
Overall a good experience but its a bit on the expensive side.
