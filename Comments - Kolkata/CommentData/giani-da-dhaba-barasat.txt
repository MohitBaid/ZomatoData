If you realy want to eat in proper dhaba then plz visit atleast once . Must try mutton tarka ,mutton masala and tandoori chicken . Tandoori ruti also good .
Great taste .some extra butter and spice are in all food like accuurate punjabi taste.
Food 9/10
Too much pocket friendly.
Sarvice also good but not ac and other facilities like washroom only cash option etc.

So far one of the best Dhaba in Kolkata..! Dishes are too tasty and delicious. I had ordered Mixed Veg Rice which came with so much quantity of paneer pieces in it that you don't need to order any other veg side dishes!! Chicken Butter Masala and Mutton Kasha was out of the world. Awesome gravy and plentiful servings. Service is quick and very less wait time... Only cash payment is allowed as far as I know. Early morning tea is also tasty and piping hot...! I just love being here.
