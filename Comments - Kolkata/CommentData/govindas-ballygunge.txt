The best vegetarian place that too Jain vegetarian. They serve authentic North Indian and Chinese food in the Indiansed version. Their Paneer is fantastic and the freshness of the food gives a flavour which cannot be avoided without a praise. The place is maintained by Iscon temple management which is why the food has been kept at the highest standards. Also the prices are very very reasonable without a shred of doubt and I think it's a must try for every vegetarian food lover. Though for a ambience perspective and a bit of management part of the staff personnel, I would recommend better control so that it remains the best.

Been here several times with my pure vegetarian friends. 
The best thing to order here is the dragon paneer and crispy chilli baby corn according to me. 
We usually order the paneer Tikka masala, mix veg and kashmiri aloo dum with butter Nan.
The restaurant is a heaven for vegetarians as it does not compromise with the quality. 
The interior is well decorated and it is spacious. 
Would recommend to people searching for pure vegetarian restaurants.

Govinda's is a lovely Vegetarian Restaurant. They follow a no onion no garlic policy and still churn out very wholesome flavourful food. My usual picks are Cheese Naan , Paneer Butter Masala , Channa Masala and Masala Papad. Their Dal Makhani is also pretty good. From the Chinese section I have only tried the Crispy Chilly Baby Corn and American Corn Pepper Salt which were quite nice. The Dosa's are also a good snack option. Good value for money is an added plus.

I wss here last weekend as i was craving for veggie delicacies. I admit they serve purest form of vegetarian food(no onion and no garlic). I had tandoori platter in starters and it was so good. This is the first vegetarian restaurant that made me fall in love with their Hyderabadi biryani. Paneer butter masala was so smooth that as soon as you will take the first bite it will melt in your mouth. Though i didn't like the dal fry because they mixed chana dal with arher dal. It was a delightful experience. You will find Lord Krishna portraits all around the restaurant. It was a good experience staff was very friendly. I will definitely go back for sure. Hare RAMA Hare KRISHNA.

I don’t know how they manage to deliver wrong items whenever I order for home delivery. This is the 2nd time. Today I’ve ordered veg noodles and veg munchurian for my parents and they’ve sent veg fried rice. I called them up and informed them. They are asking me to manage the situation. This is ridiculous.

Have been regular in this restaurant during lunch time.. Usual order is Thali priced at Rs. 140/- (taxes extra). They give one portion of daal, one potato & vegetable based curry, one protein based portion usually like chickpeas or they can even give you mixed vegetable if you ask for it.. Apart from that you get rice, fulka with some ghee applied on it, half papad, kheer, salad, pickle.. Except for papad, kheer and salad, all items are unlimited, but I usually take 4 fulkas, one small bowl of rice and two helpings of all vegetables/daal.. However I do not take the pickle, as according to Ayurved one should not have sour/spicy pickle with milk/milk items (like sweetened milk, kheer, rabri, etc.) and in fact you should try to avoid eating pickles if your lunch/dinner contains sweet items.. This is particularly more important to keep in mind if pickles contain mustard paste/mustard oil, as mustard reacts very badly with milk/milk items/sweet items..

Have also tried Chinese items here, but I order only one dish in one visit as the serving is quite large.. The taste of even those are very good and they use generous amounts of pure pepper, which makes the dish really tasty.. Havent tried their North Indian dishes as the servings are beyond my capability to finish and I am strongly against wasting/throwing food..

All items are pure saatvik, does not cause bloating or acidity and does not contain onion/garlic.. Really feel blessed after eating here.. One thing you can be assured of is that all raw materials are carefully purchased, are very fresh and pure and the food preparation is always fresh without fail..

Service is a little issue here as most of the time the entire restaurant is full and manpower is limited.. So during lunch time you might get delayed services to some extent.. The motto of the restaurant is to provide top quality food at reasonable prices..

Ambience wise it is good, but recently it is undergoing major renovation work so currently the restaurant has been shifted to the hall.. The walls are adorned with beautiful paintings and the color tone of light in the restaurant is soothing yellow.. The ceiling is adorned with beautiful chandeliers..

Basically the restaurant is not a fancy restaurant with menu cards containing jazzed up dish names.. So don't go there if you want fancy food or place or time or you have too much money to waste/show off.. This place is only for those who are wise enough about taste and want top quality food with best ingredients available, prepared in the best possible manner ceteris paribus..

Tip to the Restaurant : Please do not give sour/spicy pickles in lunch.. Instead you can give sweet chutneys like plum chutney/jaggery chutney with raisins, etc. If you want to give pickles, try giving sweet pickles like sweet mango pickle/ sweet pineapple pickle/ sweet lotus stem (kamal kakdi), etc

Not many places serve Jain food with good quality and great range... I will not say the taste of rest of the foods apart from Indian is great enough... But obviously it's make a lots of easier choices for the people who are veg.  Quick service and good Indian Thali makes your supper a good one... Try

Ordered food at a friend's place. We ordered in bulk as there were many people. There was veg chowmein rice veg biriyani hyderabadi biryani manchurian and cheese malai kofta. 
Chinese was good. 
But the malai kofta was terrible. Some dishes were overspiced. 
However overall. As a veg restaurant. It is pretty good.

I have visited this place many times. It serves pure Jain food. And being a Bengali who loves non-veg food to the core, I can confidently say that if u dine at this place, you'll not at all miss non veg cuisine. This place is a wonder house for pure veg food.

I've tried a variety of their dishes including Tandoori roti, masala kulcha, paneer dishes, kofta, a variety of dal, mixed vegetables. We've also tried their Chinese cuisine which includes lip smacking momos, fried rice, chowmein. All of these are so good that you'll want to go there again and again.
Personally I liked their Chinese cuisine more.

Two dishes that I didn't like are white gravy mixed vegetable and vanilla Ice cream with gulab jamun .

Just beside the eatery they've a sweet shop from where we can get a wide assortment of sweets. A must try definitely.

The ambience is very peaceful and the staff are very courteous.

Regardless of your cuisine preference, this place is a must visit.

As a vegetarian and especially if you don't want to eat onion and garlic,  I think Govinda's is the best place to visit. The ambiance is great, food is delicious and it's hygienic. The only drawback is that the serving takes more time as compared to other restaurants I feel?  And maybe if they could update their menu with more options then it would be great. Do visit Govinda's with your friends and family!

We had lunch at the Ballygunge outlet on 20/07/2017, the food we ordered was tasty and good. Then we carried home some kesar rajbhog and baked cham cham. We were utterly disappointed at the quality of the sweets, the baked cham cham was something else but not cham cham and the rajbhog were stale and smelly. We did not expect such inferior quality products from your Organisation.

Govinda's is a veg restaurant near my place accessible from both ballygunge circular road and gurusaday road. I've been here many times. I love triple fried rice which is combination of fried rice, manchurian and fried crispy noodles. Thali is also good.. Filling and lots of varieties. Almost all the vegetables are nice but some are sweet like shahid paneer so plz ask before asking. My fav are Kashmir loo dum, matar paneer and paneer butter masala. They also serve pastries which were nice and soft. Very crowded on weekends and have to wait for our turn. You also get jain food here.. A good place for all vegetarians out there.

A restaurant which serves not just veg food but rather prasad or offered food. Wow it only makes it special.
We ordered paneer tikka which was superbly done with just perfect grilling. Generous in quantity.
The other was crispy babycorn in which I felt if had a tad more sauce which diminished the crunchy nataure of babycorn though the taste of sauce was good but still I found it average.
In main course we ordered kashmiri dum aloo, soya keema, biryani, butter naan and mixed raita.
Veg biryani was superb, just perfect with smoky flavour as well.
Soya keema was amazing, its a unique dish and very tasty option for pure veg people.
The next came kashmiri dum aloo, which was superbly done in a rich gravy.
The raita was the worst of all dishes, it was sour and way too sweet to be likened with the biryani.
One special mention of naan. Slightly sweet and crunchy, it was just beautiful. 
Service of this place is way too slow. The biggest drawback is that you have to wait a lot, plus dont expect very attentive or VIP service at this place, but so nice prasaad it makes up for it.
Overall a perfect place for family get together.

Pizzas are a disappointment, or maybe they have a different style, more Italian than others. Indian food is 10/10. Kofta, Paneer dishes, Naans, Babycorn, Masala Papads, all very well made and served.

Excellent Indian food- This place is part of ISKCON and serves excellent Indian food albeit at high prices. 
The thali here is an excellent choice if you want to save some money as it gives a full meal. They also offer Chinese and South Indian which is average. One negative is that they don't accept cards for amounts less than 300/- which is absurd.

😋😋Govinda's Is The Bestest Place For Us And For Our Friends As Well. We Used To Go There Regularly From 7:00pm Onwards And We Used To Have Veg Thali @ Rs. 60/- But Now Their Thali's Are So Expesive That We Can't Afford To Go And Eat There Any More. Because Now The Veg Thali's Prices Are Rs. 140/- And Govinda's Special Thali Is Rs. 265/- So So Expensive With Tax + Vat. But Does Not Matter To Us Because To On 9th January 2017 On A Lovely Monday Evening My Dad Visited This Place For The 65th Time And Bought For Me Son Papri From Govinda's. Thank you Govinda's And My Daddy For Making My Day Very Fabulous.😄😄

We mostly stuck to south Indian food. The cheese masala and mysore masala dosas were disappointing. Barely any cheese in the former and a green chutney spread inside the latter - both huge missteps. They were also served nearly cold. The vada was just not crisp enough. Gobi manchurian was overdone in all ways - too spicy, tangy. The sweet lassi and the sweets from the adjoining sweet shop were the saving grace. Poor, harried service. We were pretty much forced to share a table for no good reason. A huge letdown of expectations carried from awesome experiences at other Iskcon restaurants.

I tried 11 items, all were superb! I kept on licking my fingers. :D I will recommend this place to any of friends. Veg is not boring, come on try Cheese Malai Kofta, Chopsuey and the Biriyani section! You are gonna love it. Sorry I ate all the food so couldn't take photo. Waiters were quite friendly and suggestive and sitting arrangements were really decent. PS- This Biriyani was not Pulao!

Order anything be it Indian or Chinese (yes they cook excellent chinese without onion and garlic) you will not be dissapointed. Their Veg Biryani is just wow. Do try an interesting chinese dish that they make, Triple Fried Rice.  They have two outlets- one in Gurusaday Road near Mainland China and the other near Minto Park.

I had the Dhania dosa. Taste wise it was better than most Dhania dosas that I've had. The portions served were sufficient. The staff is cordial, and it's a nice value for money place to be with your family.

Was losing out on dinner time so ended up in Govinda's.

Looking at the ambience, I thought it was attached to a temple. My bad. Was wrong. The ambience was kind of homely and old.

The food we ordered - Dum Aloo, Dal Makhani, Butter Naan and Paneer. All the three dishes equally bad. I have had food that tasted good without onions and garlic.  But the food we had here literally tasted bad.

Have nothing else to say.

The eater has a sweet shop and a restaurant serving wide spread of all veg foods starting from indian, chineese and continental. The foods are mouth watering bid any veg food with onions and garlic . I would recommend every veg lover to try out their North indian platter, Veg Biriyani and Aloor dum.

A perfect destination for any vegan. The food is pure veg devoid of onion n garlic. Yet there is no compromise in taste. We had here the following:
Veg pulao: the aromatic rice with boiled veggies n paneer gives the perfect taste of Indian pulao.
Mixed veg: the spices blends with the vegetables and provides a unique taste to ur taste buds.
Paneer makhanwala: the rich gravy and the buttery smooth paneer melts in ur mouth once u have it. Goes great with lachha paratha n butter naan.

Overall, the ambience n food is over to mould the customers really well with their mouthwatering taste of Indian dishes n that too veg!

Govinda's which is an offering of ISKCON  provides the best veg food probably in the entire city. I really don't know how they make such great food with neither onion nor garlic. They serve a variety of cuisines and each of them is fantastic in its own right. Even the quantity is massive for the minimal amount that they charge. All this with people to take extreme care of one's needs. Govinda's is undoubtedly the best veg restaurant.

If you are looking for Pure Veg Food and that too devoid of Onion and Garlic,Govinda's is a right choice.Though I ordered Veg Thali via Zomato,I found it hot and freshly prepared.Though lil bit pricey(wont say much @ Rs.300) and not that kinda variation like Rajdhani's,if you like to go for traditional Veg Food like Dal Makhani,Panner Butter Masala,Mixed veg,Payesh,Kulcha etc. and a handsome quantity(one max thali can easily be shared by two though its aimed for single consumption),Iscon operated Govinda's stands out of the crowd.

Maintained by isckon group....a purely vegetarian restaurant that does not even serve onion or garlic. Inspite of that the food is yummy and tasty. Be it dal makhani....paneer butter masala...mix veg...kofta. All are good. Food is not oily....portions are appropriate. Starters like paneer tikka are also mouth watering. 
The negative is that the tables are too close to one other ....place stays crowded. Ambience is OK. 
They can improve on the quality of their soups. Rest all is fine.

I was in doubt after I discovered the location of the place.It is very difficult to trace  the place,since the restaurant is inside the Iskcon house with no signboards outside.Secondly,we had to wait for a long time to get seats.The ambience is  average  and very congested seating arrangement.The place is ideal for pure vegetarians.The food is undoubtedly very delicious.They cook their food in pure ghee with no garlic or onions.We tried Tomato Dhania Shorba,which was a very yummy and  light flavored. Paneer Achari Tikka,which tasted no less than the tikka served in non veg restaurants.Malai Kofta was just mouth melting.The kofta was soft and the gravy was thick,creamy and sweet.Gobi Matar was too oily,but tasted good.Peas Pulao and Masala Kulcha were average.
Nice pure vegetarian food experience.

Govinda’s is not the go to restaurant unless there is a need to eat pure veg food that to sans onion and garlic.  Actually,this is the real USP of this place that draws crowd and makes this a very popular and ‘hatke’ choice.
 They also have a sweets shop which serves great mithais and also have a good variety of eggless pastries and cakes.


From the restaurant menu, my recommendations are: The lemon coriander soup- Its light, tasty and served in the right quantity. Masala Kulcha is another stellar dish that can be had as a complete meal. You could combine it with a Kashmiri aloo dum. The corn palak is also worth a try. The main dishes (and there are quite a few- the place serves every thing from north indian to indian chinese to indian continental!) are tasty but more often than not are oily and rich. This may be to compensate for non-usage of onion and garlic but ends up making the food a bit “banquet food” like. The south indian items of idli, dosa and vada are quite nice and prepared fresh

There is one type of food that the restaurant does not serve and is a real opportunity. This is the temple style satvik food and it’s indeed surprising that this is not even served. It can really be the primary cuisine of the place.

A very popular veg friendly joint. This outlet is bigger than the minto park outlet. The place is divided between a restaurant area and a sweets area. There is a lawn too for parties and an iskon gift shop. The menu is elaborate including north Indian, south Indian,chaats and Chinese. The food is good here. I like the paneer tikka and kebab platter which is wholesome. The Chinese is good too. Red pepper Paneer is my favorite with fried rice. 
Their thali is perfect yo sample north Indian food and is very filling.
It is surprising that they don't use any onion n garlic n still manage to offer such amazing food!
The staff here is kind of rude and service is slow.
The sweets section has assorted pastries and Indian sweets and their kachagolla and mango sandesh are amazing!
Overall a very good family joint.

If you are a veggie and being in Kolkata not visited Govinda's then do prioritise it today. This an outlet governed by the Iskon authorities . This joint serves food which can not only compete with the best non vegeterian eateries of the city in terms of quality, quantity and taste but it will also make the omnivores revisit them.
Serving from a limited basket Govinda offers primarily indian and chinese cuisine right from starters to main course. Being in hurry i decided to take parcel which included hakka noodles, biriyani, chana masala, paneer tikka butter masala and corn paneer. The bread basket consisted of pudina paratha, lacha paratha and masala kulcha. The quantity was huge and taste was superb. The paneer tikka butter masala, biriyani and pudina paratha stands out . 
In an era where cafes and concept cuisines are trending the places like Govinda's will always be favourite of Kolkatans.

Coming to food...it ws okay.. V had ordered regular babycorn in starters...

Triple schezwan in Chinese which was good in taste..

In desert we had ordered soda float...to my surprise it came simply plain with no flavour.. I had coke float on previous occasions so I thought it would be similar but alas it ws not..

They can server ppl bttr if they have proper planning and management.. Sunday is going to be house full day but they were least prepared for it..

Many items on menu were not available or not sure they dint wanted to serve because of long queue ;)

This place is good for veg customers as they cam have level of comfort that it is only vegetarian restaurant. although there is lots of Menu choice, preparation is also good taste wise but staff does not seem to be trained and organised. They have lots of confusion. time taken is much. They are not aware in what order to serve. to us they brought dinner items first and the soft drinks much later so we have to cancel the soft drink order. They served food for one person first instead of serving the amin course menu at a time when you are in the group. The dal they served was leaking out from all sides of utensil. We ordered Tandoori Roti but we found that maida was mixed while preparing so it was more a naan then Roti since roti is made of Aata only and no maida is mixed in to it. we found most of the serving staff with wooden face I think they can surly improve the things with little efforts.

Located inside the Iscon society, Govinda's is one of the famous restaurants in Kolkata particularly for their Thali.

The special thali comes with Stuffed kulcha, butter naan, Paneer gravy, Mix veg curry, dal makhni, raitha, peas pulao and rasgolla. The food tasted amazing and all the dishes were cooked with care. 
Thali costs 300 and is well worth the money. Service however can be better.

The starters of corn and paneer are real appetizers. Plus-point is that you get chinese,north indian & south indian cuisines under the same roof. The sweets & bakery section is worth drooling over ;)

As far as an authentically good vegetarian restaurant is concerned, this place will unwaveringly fulfil all your criteria! The sober interior and the courteous staffs only add to the brownie points! Here at Govinda's it's a matter of huge loss if one has ever left without tasting the Beigan ka bharta, the Malai kofta, the soya bean chilly and the Navaratan Pulao! An astoundingly serene environment, nothing fancy, reasonable price and excellent food quality! If you ask me, this should be every vegetarian's delight! Most importantly, it supposedly comes with the widest range of vegetarian dishes you will ever know!

A restaurant run by Iscon society which is purely vegetarian and most probably their food is without onion and garlic. The Ballygunge outlet is very popular and very crowded most of the times,especially on holidays. Their food is quite tasty and they have reasonable variety. But the service is not up to the mark,it needs a lot of improvement. They also have a Mithai shop which has both Indian and western desserts. They are quite good and reasonably priced.

I will always remember this place, as this was not only near my school but this where I always visit to revive my taste buds. 

Paneer Makhanwala,
Kadai paner, 
Nargis Kofta 

These are some of my favourites. The essence because of the use of home made butter and ghee gives a taste like no other. 

With these dishes I prefer plain roti or butter naan. If you are into rice don't miss to try the kolhapuri rice and the kashmiri pulao. The blend of fruits and vegetables really makes this dishes special. 

As for the ambience this restuarent is well maintained with a sense of serenity and peace that may give you a overwhelming feeling.

Beside domino's ballygunge, this is a fine "pure veg restaurant" (so pure veg that they dont even use onions and garlic). I have tried mix veg, veg handi, malai kofta and paneer tikka butter masala and i find all dishes quite good but the malai kofta is a bit extra sweet and rich. The paneer dishes are recommended.

A nice option for vegetarian food lovers.There are a plethora of veg restaurants in Kolkata who serve onion and garlic in vegetarian food.Thanks to Govinda's for not making that mistake.

I had the good fortune of visiting their confectionary unit (a couple of times) as well as restaurant (once).Both are located just adjacent to each other.In fact,the entry to the restaurant is through the confectionary outlet.

To talk about the confectionary unit,the items are really tasteful and use premium quality material.They serve mithai items as well as pastries,and namkeens and snacks as well. There is also a small table with seating arrangement (a total of about 5-6 persons can sit) in case someone just wants to relax.

As far as the fine-dining restaurant is concerned,we went there for a Sunday Special Breakfast Buffet.We were spoilt for choice with items like Fruit Juice,Bread-Butter(with sugar/pepper),Milk/Cornflakes,Kachori,Hot jalebi (just tastes fabulous!),Masala Dhosa,Idli and what not (sorry I do not remember all the items at this moment as I went there almost 2 months back!!) . We were delighted to know that such a good vegetarian breakfast option exists in the city.

I find some comments here that this place serves only vegetarian food and some people have given less rating because of that.

But we have to understand that this is run by ISKCON who by their philosophy stresses on vegetarian food. So they cannot simply serve non-veg items in their own restaurant.

On the whole, a nice offering in the vegetarian food platter of Kolkata.

Horrific service, horrific wait staff, horrific behaviour, horrific misbehaviour when asked to explain a dish. I want to slap all of these people I see working there.

Pros: Great food even if oily (when it opened it wasnt but on public demand they changed the food to oily)

The disservice is so bad that the good food is not enough for me to go back

The sweet shop on the other hand, good sweets with good service. Great chhena pais, and laddus. Even the parwal ki mithai is quite good.

Located near Ballygunje phari, diagonally opposite to Mainland china. Govinda's is a complete vegetarian restaurant. There is enough seating space and the restaurant is very clean.

It being a part of Iskcon operated restaurant chain, prepares food with no onion and garlic. Most of the food tastes delicious with decent portions of food. A place wherein modernity meets tradition.

For the starters, my personal favourites are the Crispy chilli baby corn and Paneer tikka. Crispy chilli baby corn as the name suggests is crisp yo the right amount and Paneer tikka has large portions of Paneer and veggies.
For the mains, for me it is Kadhai paneer, Dal makhani or Dal tadka, cheese naans or masala kulchas, jeera rice and masala papad.

Also, not to forget the Chinese cuisine - Hakka noodles with manchurian and momos with soup tasted beyond words could describe.

Fresh lime soda and aam panna in beverages - just right in taste!

However, service can be slow at peak hours, so can the wait. But wait is worth the food.

Happy eating!

I visited this place quite sometime back ...but writing the review today( sorry fr the late entry fellas).

We went there on a sunday aftrnoon. The ambience was nice. Now i am a hardcore nonveg so going to govindas wont be my first choice. But still nonetheless it was my first time there and i njoyed it.

We wre 4 people and we ordered crispi fried babycorn and paneer tikka first . It was ok. Then over the main course we order peas pulao ,navratan korma, dal makhani, kadai paneer and mixed veg .. The taste was nothing out of the ordinary ..the mixed veg was kinda nice though but the dal makhani was yum..rich and creamy..

The price was very reasonable..excellent place for vegetarians but i dnt think govindas would b a nonvegetarian's first choice ....

If someone is a veggie and wants to have a decent hygienic meal then govinda's is THE place. we ordered an Indian thali and each item was delicious with the right amount of spice and salt. A special mention of their dhoklas which are chunky and melt in your mouth... Keep up the good work..hare Krishna!!

The waiter have attitude as if they serving us for free and doing a charity on us. I being and outsider and staying in a P.G. only tolerate their attitude because of the quality and home made like food they serve in Thali, Otherwise i would have never visited this place again after my first visit.

It's paradise if you are a pure vegetarian and even more so if you are looking for food preparations without onion garlic. And trust me you won't believe all the food is made without those. The menu is elaborate, food is delicious and you can also have sweets or pastries from the attached sweet-shop, plus visit the temple above. The service is good too though its usually very over-crowded so you may not get any service at all. But then again, you can't blame them for being that good!

But i was highly disappointed by the Veg Biriyani. I must say a blunder from the chef.

Recent Review in 2017
==============
Lot of changes I observed regarding the restaurant compared to 2 years back.
What has improved a lot is the hospitality of the staffs but food quality has degraded a lot.
The same special thali quality wise have been degraded. The sabjees , dal, roti and rice tatsed very ordinary and the baby corn which we ordered separately were burnt and tasted bitter in soya sauce. Will rethink to revisit this place in future. (new rating 3.0/5.0)

Earlier Review in 2015 (rating 3.5/5)
==============
                        I had their special thali - they took rs 20 as parceling charge , so total cost of the plate came around 320.What they gave were as follows :1. Kulcha 1 pc- it was neatly wrapped in foil and was very tender when I had it after 3 hours of parceling the food.2. Butter naan 1 pc- equally good.3. Paneer in some white gravy - The paneer pieces were very tiny but taste was good.4. Mixed veg - carrot, beans, cauliflower , paneer and peas were present  and I did not leave a small portion of that--so yummy.5. 1 Roasted Papad.6. 1 Big rassogolla.7. Boondi raita.8. Jeera rice - quantity is very less for rice-lovers.9. 2 pieces of cucumber-10. Dal makhani - which was good but not excellent like other items. Then why 3.5? simply because I felt the food is over-priced. For quality its 5/5 no doubt, quantity wise I would say would suffice 2 if an additional rice item is ordered. Staffs are bit rude and the place is so crowded  that they wont give you much attention and nor they remember to pick your orders neatly.

Again back to this place coz I personally love its pure veg cuisine.
For the starters Crispy Chilly Babycorn was perfectly cooked & its flavours & crispyness was perfectly placed together.
Then for main course Hakka noodles was a bit let down as its knows for its Chinese dishes also but it was "plain dead " no taste no flavours .
BUT the manchurian along with it was a great match and balanced the taste of my tastebuds and it was really good to go then. 
& Sweet lime soda was good fizzed up properly.. and well balanced...
I love this place came here along with @minie & @pooh teddy

I've stayed in the area for quite sometime and have visited this amazing place many times. I simply loved their preparations and the dedication of the people working there's shows in it. Each and every item is worth a try starting from food to sweets. I wouldn't talk about the prices being high cause for a vegetarian, it's heaven and I being a non-vegetarian would vouch for this joint any day.

It's a must visit place for every vegetarian in town. Hope to visit soon.

“Great Food, Average Experience”

The rating above is strictly about the food served at Govinda's Kolkata, part of the ISKCON operated restaurant chain. You obviously expect a minimum level of food quality when you visit a Govinda's outlet.

About the average experience. The layout and interiors are 'disoriented'. You have to ask your way to the restaurant, and the sections within the restaurant are strangely done, to say the least. We were ushered in to the inner section with sofa-type seating, but preferred the chair-table setting in the outer section to the somewhat claustrophobic inner section.

We were late for lunch but we checked with the staff before ordering our Thalis. A Thali in our experience is the quickest choice at any restaurant; not at Govinda's. But no one warned us, and we waited and waited and waited. We were hungry hence we kept asking about our thalis. One of the staff members curtly told us that Thalis do take 20 minutes.....why were we not told this before/while ordering.

With no place nearby and a flight to catch, we had no option but to wait. We tried some sweets from the Govinda's sweet shop next door, and they were out of this world. Ras Malai, Rossogulla and Rajbhog, all were yum. And the prices were 1/3rd of Mumbai.

The sweets made the wait bearable, and the remaining good was done by the Thali when it arrived. Simple, homely food served fresh and hot. The ingredients evidenced quality by the aroma of the dishes. Every item on the menu was delicious, with the fragrant rice and dal taking the cake. All this, unlimited, for Rs. 150. I hope our Rajdhanis, Golden Stars, Samrats and others take notice. I did not mention Thackers at Marine Drive as my next review is about them.

In summary, divine food with a not so divine setting and staff. ISKCON management can do much better than this - they can replicate best practices from other Govinda's outlets.

Well, I visited this place twice! The food here is prepared without onions and garlic, but tgat is not the problem here! The menu has large varieties of dishes ranging from Indian to Chinese and Italian cuisine. The ambience as ok but the food was delicious. Service is good, staff is friendly, and its not too expensive!
Thali is recommend!
Also have fresh lime soda after the meal!
Happy Eating!

A perfect place for pure veggies...the ambience goes well with the mood one generally has going there... Govindas is an eating outlet of the Iscon Temple...
The staff is very courteous...and the food is just wow...it is utterly butterly delicious...be it north indian or chinese (south indian also available)... The regular visitors often opt for "Thali"... which includes normal dal, chawal, roti, papad, sweets n many more...

Govinda's is one of the very few places in the city that serves Jain food without asking for it, so a regular visit with parents.  Food is good,  the staff is well trained and the restaurant is well equipped to deal with a large number of customers.

If you want to experience pure vegetarian cuisines this is the place you should look for.  When I say pure vegetarian means pure coz its a restaurant controlled by the Iscon Authorities and Priests.  And they do not call food here you have to say Prashad . 

The Ambience and The Decor is very Beautiful and the soft music that plays on the background gives you a very nice feeling . The quality of the staffs are excellent food served is very quick . Any dish you order will be great because the preparation is totally in a traditional way and as this is an Iscon based restaurant they do not give salt here on their dishes but somehow it tastes excellent . You should definitely come here and the Vegans this is the one and only legit restaurant . Must order Sweets after lunch their sweets are aw

If you are a vegetarian, this place is a must-go. Situated next to Iskon mandir,Camac street, this place also has a sweet parlour attached to it which has this amazing collection of shondesh and rabri. Didn't get a place to sit when I went there for the first time and hence opted for "take away". But would love to visit there again !

Being a veggie it was always my treasure hunt for a pure vegeterian resturant where i can get the dishes w/o onion garlic. And the govida's is the pearl in the shell. Was there yesterday and the ambiance was all debotional. Staffs were very helpful and the food was awesome.also no delay in serving time. And you will amazed by seeing the menu and varities they have.

Very good eatery for people who like to eat at veg-only restaurants. I ordered the special thali. Wasn't disppointed. Good taste and decent portions. One thali without second helpings is enough for two!

I visited this place upon prolonged insistence from my best friend. And i was happily surprised. The food was of great quality and very tasty. I had the thali..one thali was more than enough for both of us. Our thali had dal makhani, two yummy sabji , fried rice , roti among other things.

Most importatnly,  Its a vegetarian place, but infact till date the best veg food i've ever had. The food is amazing specially the masala kulchas and the pineapple raita.
The staff is very cordial and the ambience is good.
Its a must try out for all veg lovers and the its not at all an expensive place.
Non veg eaters should also try ;)

Located inside the ISKCON HOUSE of Gurusaday road in Ballygunge. Perhaps only one of its kinds in the heart of Kolkata preparing variety of vegetarian flares without any use of onion or garlic.
Just at the point of its entrance, the sweets & snacks outlet of "Govinda's" is situated;it sales a variety of sweets and savories ranging from- milk cake, kalakand, rasmalai, chamcham, peda, kesar rasmalai etc; snacks and savories like-samosa, kachori, veg cutlet/chop etc;. Now as we walk past the sweet shop towards the restaurant area; we get to see a mesmerizing statue of deities (radha&Krishna), then a mocktain/juice counter situated on your left hand side, then comes the reception; which stays quite cluttered because the "take away" orders are received here in the reception itself. Then after further walking from there, we get to enter the proper restaurant area, where the sitting arrangements are made for dine in. It is quite neatly and efficiently decorated, being a part of ISCKON, its decor has a touch of devotion and spirituality with photos and deities of lord Krishna exhibited all around the place. The ambience had a touch of elegence.
The staffs are very courteous and efficient.
As we already know, they serve completely vegetarian dishes and that too without onion and garlic. But when you go through their menu, its vast and variety of offerings ranging from North Indian, Chinese, Italian, American(fast food), South Indian etc would definitely surprise you. 
All those dishes which we never thought could be prepared without onion and garlic even in our dreams are served here with zero onion and garlic with sheer PERFECTION.
I got the opportunity to try out their north Indian offerings till now, and I can confidently say that it tasted unbelievably succumbing and tantalizing and much better than of other restaurants who prepare the same dishes with adding onion and garlic.
Be it the "paneer butter masala" which has a smooth creamy texture and the paneer just melting in your mouth-- ahh!! Its simply heaven.
Then the "butter naan" soft as cotton and stuffed with mouth watering flavor.
Their innovative "nutrela(soya chunks) reshmi tikka" is also damn succulent and a huge example of culinary innovation.
"Daal Makhani" served over here really justifies its name i.e. "Makhani", cause its so damn smooth and punched with mouth watering and aromatic spices, which gives your taste buds a real treat.
Other dishes like- malai kofta, palak pander, methi aloo, kashmiri pulao, navaratan korma, nargisi kofta etc; are tremendously succulent too.
They also serve a wide variety of chinese dishes like - veg Manchurian, chilli babycorn, chow mein, fried rice etc; though I didn't try them out yet but hopefully it would not fail to stand up to the expectation.
Overall a treasure trove for the vegetarians in town as well as for foodies like us, who appreciates and loves gulping a quality preparation any time of the day.

A horrible disgusting and unhygienic experience!! 

After hearing a lot about this place from friends I decided to pick this place for a lunch meeting with friends whom I was meeting after a long time. So it happens that we all ordered and the food took a while to come to the table,  they gave us the wrong number of glasses and plates at the start of the service and it became evident for me that the service is going to be sloppy. I decided to live with it and was looking forward to the food. The food came in instalments and when it all finally arrived at the table we were famished by then. Just to let you all reading this know that none of us in the group were actually vegetarian but we decided on this place given its reputation of serving good food. So we had just started eating and my friend discovers a few dead ants in her noodles!! 
I am a hotelier by profession and can completely understand that things like this happen at times. It's sometimes inevitable and I was still okay till this point of time. We called the server and pointed out the problem. And what he did was just surprising, he looked at the plate turned around as if nothing had happened and walked away. I waited for a while and called another server and told him the same. He just took the bowl of noodles and started walking when I called him and asked if if he could take the plate away as well,  he just let out a grunt and took it away. Now we are waiting for another 10 mins nothing happens and I was hungry so I stated eating from a friend's plate and a server comes and tells me sir since it's a thali you cannot share it. This is when I completely lost it. I still decided on not creating a scene as I was meeting these friends after a long time and didn't want to spoil the mood. After a while a server comes to us and says we will re do the noodles and bring it back. I had lost my appetite by then and asked the person not to bring the noodles back.  We finally asked for the check and decided to leave and guess what these people had the audacity to bill me for the noodles that had ants in it and was sent back after taking two spoons of. I decided not to say a word we settled the check and left. I will never go back to this place again and will not recommend any one to this place ever. See I undestand that there can be an ant in the food in a commercial kitchen no matter how careful you are mistakes can happen I have worked in one myself. But when you know that you have served insects on a plate to people the least you can do is to be a little apologetic about it and to make up for it and not tell me that I cannot share food and if the staff is not even trained to do that at least have the courtesy to not bill me for what I have not eaten.

Authentic veg food ..and delicious at that. Usually when my family members have any religious restrictions etc i always prefer to bring them here. 

The stuffed kashmiri aloo dum and the paneer are really good and then the deserts are also very very good. Coupled with that the place is conveniently located and has its own parking which is a  big plus point. 

But beware...its always crowded!

Govinda's - A perfect Veggie Friendly Eatery!!
======
Intro: I was in the office in Gurusaday Road and one of the staff in charge did a take away for me from Govinda's. I have been hearing about Govinda's from many of my vegetarian friends and somehow gave it a try on 14.02.2015. The food which i ate comprised of the corporate meal. 
======
Corporate Meal included:

1) Dal with Rice - It complemented each other. It was hygienic and tasted really good. Not with too much of spices and not too much bland.
2) Paneer Butter Masala - I loved it. Paneer and Capsicum tossed in creamy gravy. It was mouth melting.
3) Aloo in Thin Gravy - It was a bit spicy and tasted average
4) 4 Roti - The roti's were homely as per the corporate lunch. 
5) 2 pieces Masala Papad. 
6) Pais - I personally did not try it. My friend tried it and gave a good review about it. 
======
Pros:
1) Pure Veg
2) Good quality food.
3) Good taste.
4) Good Packaging. 
======
Summary: 
Food quality 4.2/5
Food taste 4.3/5
Hygiene 4.1/5
Food quantity 4.2/5
======
Conclusion: I personally did not visit this so i really can't quote the meal price. 2 people can eat up the whole meal as it was too much.  
======
Note: Unbiased review based on my eating experience.
======
Recently was in Govinda's Side. They have different sections for sweets, mocktails/ice cream and Dining. Pictures have been attached.

Well, honestly speaking I was not impressed to hear my family members choosing a complete vegetarian joint as our dinner destination. When we arrived at the venue, it was jam packed and we had to wait nearly 1 hour for our turn (quite unexpected since I always believed Kolkata to be a full course Non Veg city). Well after a patient wait of 1 hour we finally got a chance to sit. 

While the others were busy struggling with the menu, I decided to go ahead with peas pulao, one of my all time favorites (primarily used by myself as a currency of measurement of food quality in veg restaurants) and accompanied with dal fry. After a short wait of 15 mins, the food arrived and as soon I tasted the first scoop of dal fry + pulao I knew the 1 hour wait was worthy. All the remaining dishes that we tried rated somewhere between 3.8 - 4.2 as per above scale.

The ambiance of this place is not like great (may be 3.5/5) but when you have good food, it makes up for it. The service was good and prompt, appreciate the restaurant's effort in joining 2 tables so that we could all sit together even in that very busy weekend evening.

Been to Govinda once with a group of 15 people. First of all staff was not very helpful and did not join the tables for all of us to sit together, so we had to split and sit in groups of 5. Food is ok and very bland. Service is quite poor. Only good for people with no onion and no garlic because they have very few options in the city.

The starters and Chinese is the best. You wont realize that amazing Chinese is made without onions and garlic. The staff is pleasant and smiling. Highly recommended. Hare Krishna!!

Located on Gurusaday Road , opposite to Mainland China , its heaven for veggie people . Tried the Indian thali and Special thali on diffferent occasions and would definately suggest the Special thali. How could they make food so good without onion and garlic ?? Also once went there at 4 pm to find out that they dont serve anything other than South Indian food at those odd hours.  Tried the Govinda's Special Dosa which I found quite amusing . Great place for Shudh Niramish folks.

Have been here twice. The ambience is OK. I am a vegetarian so I prefer going to veg joints and so this one was an obvious choice. Now coming to food part it is freshly prepared and very hygenic and non fussy. I prefer the pre set north Indian thali. The dosas are also good very crisp. I also tried there khichdi once which I liked but my wife didn't I think one should give it a try. But despite being a vegetarian I miss onions with the food and the food seems incomplete to my taste buds.further their savouries and sweets are very nice and surely appeal to your taste buds.one can also buy freshly baked breads.

I'm a hard core meat lover. But the food here is to die for!
Their thalis are awesome! Especially on those days when they serve paneer (Thursdays and Saturdays I think). Other than that their Navarathan Pulao and Paneer Butter Masala are also amazing. The Paneer is so soft and tender! It literally melt in your mouth!
I personally do not like their Dal Makhani or their Chinese Items, but that may just be because I'm just not fond of vegetarian Chinese.

If you're a vegetarian or willing to try some good vegetarian food, you've gotta visit this place. 

Prices are okayish. A proper meal for 2 would cost around 500-600 bucks.

Govinda's at Ballygunge Road is near the Kolkata Int'l Airport and provides a wide range of veg dishes that caters to every taste. The ambience is beautiful and the staff is friendly. Getting a seat at dinner time might be difficult, so make sure to call before hand and book a table. The food is sumptuous and the menu is reasonably priced if you take into account the seating and the place. If you're in Kolkata and need a place to eat delicious veg dishes, Govinda's is the place to be.

A welcome surprise for a strictly non veg person like me...dat authentic veg dishes can be so tasteful...we ordered for crispy chilli babycorn, kashmiri pulaw,paneer reshmi butter masala and cheese nan...superb in taste...yummylicious I should say...the portions were adequate for two and great value for money. The stewards too are courteous and quite efficient. A must visit for those who aspire to have veg dishes without onion and garlic.

Ok first thing you got to realize that the food here is strict veg means to the level of No onion and No Garlic... 

i was very skeptical of going into this place but went with a friend of mine from office... i am a vegetarian but the concept of no onion no garlic is like dude how ccan the food taste good without it.... well this place shocked me out of my wits...

i tried the soup and the momo which was like amazing and the stuffing of the momo was up to the mark and beyond....  the taste was great... 


other than that i tried the north indian (slightly) on a different occasion and i was surprised that the dal and the paneer also taste pretty good and above average...

this place is a vegetarian paradise... as everything is that only... it might not be just about amazing but it is pretty good and enjoyable for a change....

If you like veg , this is a nice place. Just opposite to Gothe Institute , it is a nice and cozy place. All their veg items taste good, and quantity and quality of the food you will appreciate. It is quite within the reach of my pocket as well. Do not miss their freshly prepared pastries and sweets. I specially like the Hot Golabjamun and " Gajarer halua". The background chantings will make your mind calm and you will find peace in yourself in the hustles and bustles of the busy roads around.

On weekends,  you might have to wait in a que, cz the restaurant serves on "first come first serve" policy. Nevertheless, it's worth giving the time..

When it comes to vegetarian I always prefer to go to Rajdhani at Manisquare, however there's this one off occasion where Rajdhani restaurant was being remodelled and I remembered about this restaurant Govinda's being referred by the friend earlier. I also had Casa Kitchen on mind, but having never tried either of them I expected Govinda's to be less of a risk. So I drove all the way there for our afternoon lunch, but the overall experience was a major turn off. The Soup was too sweet! The Crispy chilly Corn preparation's flavour was absolutely destroyed with unnecessary ingredients. The Butter Roti was average. Then there was this dish with three types of curries, it was also average. We had also ordered one Navratna Pulao which along with the curry dish we couldnt finish hence we asked for it to be parceled. Later at night when we warmed the Pulao and the Curry dish we found that its not fresh, its undoubted stale from previous day or the day before. I am quite a bit of a foodie, I go around the city trying out food in places varying from luxurious hotels like Hyatt to simple road side stalls in Sealdah (under the flyover), I put a lot of value on the freshness of the preparation and its outcome in terms of flavour with a certain extent of cleanliness and am not a guy who would go about and complain very easily, and I hardly ever leave a feedback, but this is one of those off hand experiences you just cannot forget and I feel responsible to warn others before visiting this place.

Briefing out the things we had:
1) dal makhni- purely authentic and delicious!
2) some paneer sabzi: it had pineapples too! The combinational sabzi just rocked our taste buds
3) corn saag: its a thing of perfection! Sinfully delicious! Must try!!
Aaam panna and sweet lime was in beverages! Just right in taste!
The main thing is.. None of their dishes..has onion in it yet the taste is so good..that I can munch different things here ..the whole day!

Overall a 4.5 as the ambiance was not much pleasing !

Vegetarians visiting Kolkata complain that there are not many vegetarian eating places. Govinda's is one of the best vegetarian eating places in Kolkata with pocket friendly prices. A nice family restaurant with great ambiance and with very courteous and helpful staff. Great place to visit for Vaishnav families. A place where modernity meets tradition.

Since 1999, I am a visitor to Govinda Restaurant, whenever I have some guest at home. The obvious reason is I am single here. The food quality is never compromised since years. The price hike is also not a deal for foodies like us. But today evening my experience in the restaurant is very bitter and unforgettable. Me and my friend from Asansol entered the restaurant at about  2030 Hrs. The waiter handed over us one token bearing No.9 and  made us waiting in the all. One hour passed and we observed people after us came and occupied the tables. I enquired with the boy, why you have made us waiting like this since one hour?  He  took a lame excuse for searching us and not finding, where as both of us were sitting in the hall through out. Again said to wait for 2 minutes. After complaining in the counter he called us after another 10 minutes.  While taking our dinner he gave us least attention since we had contacted the manager near the exit point. For tissue paper, chapati and drinking water we shouted and got it. This is ridiculous for both of us. I was talking too high of this food point to my friend. Instead, I had to cut a sorry figure before him. I don't want any reply or redressal. But, I request you to bestow your personal attention/intervention for improvement of services around the table.

An all veg restaurant with great food and serene atmosphere. I have had food ere a few times and liked it every time. I love their thali and I especially adore their Tandoori Roti and Dal Makhani. It does not pinch my pocket and every time I go there I am humbled by looking at the people who devote their lives to the service of Krishna. Brownie points to the managers for hosting a brilliant sweet shop just outside the restaurant. Do not visit Govinda if you are calorie conscious becuase the pain of not being able to eat the sweets is not worth it. A very good affair indeed!

I am fan of ISKCON style vegetarian food. I tried this place after someone recommended it to me in Mayapur, and it did not let me down. It is a pure veg joint, which is a plus for pure vegetarians, who feel jittery to order veg food at a non-veg joint. Anyway, so point being there is feel of purity to the entire place and even after being a thoroughbred non-veg bengali, I quite liked the experience here. The Indian fare is pretty decent. I recommend the Tomato Shorba, Masala Kulcha, Hyderabadi Mix Dal, Tawa Tamancha, Chana Masala, Kadhai Paneer. Also do not skip the raitas and salads. The south indian dishes are also up to the mark, did not try the chinese though.
The other joint near camac street is good too. They have a confectionery which is damn good. Try their banana cake!

Visiting this place since 4 yrs. They have hiked prices blindly in a kiddish way. Staff is not at all educated. Very late service nowadays.HaVe to ask for water also number of times. It's better to dine at a park street restaurant rather than paying them so much without having onion n garlic food. Food quality n quantity r deteriorating.

This review is particularly for the cake / sweet shop that is situated on both the Ballygunge Circular Road as well as the Gurusaday Road entrances to Govindas. The former is bigger, and has more variety, including breads etc.

While the products are not the best, you can be reasonably assured they are cleanly made with decent quality ingredients. The prices are very reasonable too. I have tried the breads and found them reasonably well done.The sweets are good. I particularly like the chhanar payesh and the rasamalai (both similar), which a plastic cup-ful will set you back by a reasonable Rs 20. They have a variety of sandeshes, barfis and the like. The chhana bhaja too is nice, as is the very light plain soft sandesh.

The place is reasonably well kept. Clean and cool.

Today called Govinda's gurusaday road outlet for home delivery, they have 5 km range of free home delivery of minimum order of 500 rs which is very good.. placing the order over phone was smooth, food arrived after 1 hour..Now coming to the food, ordered dal khichdi, masala kulchas, hyderabadi mix veg, nargis kofta and kashmiri alu dum.. khichdi was very good, infact best of the lot, spicy, full of veggies, very tasty.. masala kulchas were small and flat, not like punjabi kulchas but still good..hyderabadi mix veg- we didnot like it, its totally different from the mix veg with yellow gravy we found everywhere, it had green gravy and mildly spiced and had taste and aroma of raw vegetables so didnot like it..nargis kofta had 2 big pieces of kofta made of Channa(unripened curd cheese) and the gravy was tangy.. kashmiri alu dum was red in colour, sweet in taste , it was good.. apart from hyderabadi veg other items were good in taste but The main health concern here is that to make such thick and rich gravy they had to use lots and lots of cashew and almond paste and lots of ghee(since they dont use onion garlic), though veg items are always more healthy than non-veg but this type of veg food which govindas prepare are not so healthy so its better to have this kind of food once in a while, not frequently....

With so many non-vegetarian options available in the city, a 'purely vegetarian' restaurant barely catches the fancy of a habitual meat consumer. But there are times, when you make exceptions for certain reasons. Obviously, I do not intend to go into the reasons! What I will say though is, choosing Govinda's for such occasions is not in the least a bad idea, both pocket-wise and tummy-wise!
I had tried this place out once before, and it did leave a tasty impression. Almost 4 years later, my opinion remains the same.
One of these days, I ordered a special thali which comprises a nan, a masala kulccha, peas pulao, dal makhani, a paneer preparation (possibly shahi paneer), mixed vegetables, raita, papad, salad and even a rasgulla. To this I added two more masala kulcchas and voila it made for a very tasty and rather filling dinner for 3 adults (oh well, none of us 'hogged' though). The Kulcchas and paneer, in particular, were very good. There was also a bowl of tomato sorba (they call it cream of tomato soup, but it really was sorba) which, I gather was pretty good as well (I skipped it). 
Can't comment on the Chinese and South Indian sections. But the North Indian menu is quite diverse and going by the items of the special thali, they can't possibly be disappointing. And I got the food home delivered. Must say they are rather prompt. I vaguely remember the interiors from my first visit. It was small and simple. Things must have changed now though.

We have started looking for vegetarian joints since my mom converted to vegetarianism. This is one place for good pure vegetarian food. We always order for the special thali, and have never had any issue to complain. However, if you have small to medium appetite , I would recommend you to order one thali for two people. For the devotional kind, the store outside is a must  check for good incense sticks.

Pure Veg food with loads of pure ghee, sans garlic/onion. That's their USP.This is the place I visit with my shuddh shakahari friends.Located near Ballygunge Phari almost opp Mainland China, its not difficult to spot.

Love the Paneer Platter which has large portions of tandoori paneer. Tandoori potatoes are good too.
Veg Kolhapuri is very spicy and fresh. Peeli dal or Dal Tadka are always a hit. Lime Soda and masala papad on the side.
There are Chinese and South Indian dishes available, but I always stick to the north Indian. It is very tasty.

Srevice can be slow at peak hours, so can the wait. Try to get in at 7:30 for a hassle free dinner even on weekdays.

We were very thrilled to see a pure vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata! We had ordered a Mysore Masala Dosa, Khichdi and a dish called Gravy Noodles. My wife tells me that the Khichdi was very tasty! I ate the Mysore Masala Dosa and even though it didn't look or taste like a traditional Mysore Dosa, it was good. The Gravy Noodles was a disaster. My daughter tells me that it is the worst noodles that she has ever had!

In addition, I think the service is very  bad. You have to keep attracting their attention to serve you.

I have visited this place about twice and was really impressed :) 
I love non vegetarian and cannot bear being deprived of garlic and onion in my food. So I was not very enthusiastic about this joint at all !  But this place well, did not convert me or something but yes I sure did not miss garlic and onion and non vegetarian. I have had the Dosa's, Naan, Amritsaari Aloo, Matar Paneer, Lemon Spinach Coriander Soup ( Really tasty ! ) and the likes and have not once been disappointed ! They are all very tasty. 
The service is swift but the decor is very well religious :P ( That is the only way I can describe it) I know it's only expected because its a part of Iskon. 
All in all a lovely experience :) The food makes up for anything this place lacks :)

Govinda's.....is the abode of Vegetarian food !!!! I have been visiting this place for a year now .... and all I can say is .... it has changed my perception towards vegetarian food !!! Starting with momos .... to Szechwan rice...YOU ASK IT,THEY HAVE IT !!!! 

For starter,a must have item in the order is their CRISPY CHILLI BABYCORN .I have had this dish in a number of places,but this one stands out !!! The sauce is simply mouth watering !!!! Momos are good ... the best you can have in a vegetarian offering !!!

The Govinda Special Hakka Noodles is my grandma's favourite ... with cashews and 'kishmish'-es...........its a delight !!!! The same goes for their Sczchwan rice !!!! If you want to get a continental flavor out of something try the Mix veg. with white sauce !!!! Its yummylicious !!!! Their paneer dishes are equally good and mouth watering !!!

Last ,but not the least ,is their Thalis !!! Variety and taste finds a perfect blend here...although it is impossible for one person to finish a Thali !!! This place is The Lord's own abode....and the service is warm and fast !!! 

I am giving this place a 4.5 stars !!! A Must visit place it is !!!!1

I have been to Govinda's many times in the past few years. Their main attraction for me is the car parking facility available inside and also the fact that I am a vegetarian. The parking part needs to be improved in the sense that when the lawns are booked for weddings and parties, the restaurant guest is left to fend for herself. Some alternative arrangement should be made at this time. 

The variety of items available is mind-boggling and the breakfast service as well as home delivery are added attractions, started recently. But many of the dishes are really spicy and hot, which is not expected from a temple-based restaurant. We go with the feeling that we are eating Lord Krishna's bhog, so we expect homely and less spicy food. Although the waiters are accommodative and on request, provide dishes which are less spicy.

Thali meals are not available at the new restaurant at Albert Road, the management may please make a note and try to  add these to the menu as these are special attractions. The sweets, cakes and bread are excellent and so are most of the savouries. Earlier, it could be said that the restaurant was reasonably priced but now that taxes are being added on to the bill, it pinches the pocket a bit.

All said and done, I would recommend this restaurant to my relatives, friends and colleagues as a family restaurant which encourages vegetarianism and I am sure the management will look into the improvements I have suggested.

Hare Krishna!

While the products are not the best, you can be reasonably assured they are cleanly made with decent quality ingredients. The prices are very reasonable too. I have tried the breads and found them reasonably well done.

The savouries are not too bad. The corn puff in particular was interesting. Perhaps too much flour, but decent and about half the price charged at Cakes! The pizza (price has risen quite fast of late) is on a ready base, but contains goodies like olives and actually does not taste bad. Please do not expect a gourmet pizza. The veg spring rolls weren't bad, nor were the dhoklas, chops of various kinds.

The sweets are good. I particularly like the chhanar payesh and the rasamalai (both similar), which a plastic cup-ful will set you back by a reasonable Rs 20. They have a variety of sandeshes, barfis and the like. The chhana bhaja too is nice, as is the very light plain soft sandesh.

Give it a try. The Gurusaday Rd entrance has parking inside. Do remember this is a pure vegetarian place..... no onion or garlic either.



----- 20 May, 2013 -----

Walked in to Govinda's the other day, to kill some time while my daughter and wife had gone for a haircut. Started off on a bad note. I parked inside and was about to visit the ATM across the road when a man seated near the gate asked me why I parked and walked out. When I mentioned I wanted to visited the ATM to withdraw money to eat he said to park outside and an argument ensued. The point is if I had known him to be a guard (he did not look like one), I would have told him.

After getting the money I ordered a dhaniya masala dosa and a fresh lime soda. The FLS was like always, kind of flat and way below the standards they had some years back. The dosa was a disappointment It took long to come (which that day was not a problem as I had time to kill). It tasted sour / salty... I cannot describe the taste but I do not like it. The masala was nothing great nor was the accompanying chutney. 100 bucks is better spent elsewhere!

I ended my meal with a small bowl of rasmalai. It was rather nice (though a bit too sweet) and at 15 rupees, pretty good value. I ordered another one.

The adjacent sweet / snacks counter serves some rather nice stuff... well at least at very decent prices. I recall the corn puffs to be good.



----- 22 Mar, 2013 -----

Being an avid non-vegetarian Govinda would not have been in my places visited unless it had been so close to home.

I must say they do a good job with their food. Quality is one thing you cannot find fault with, since almost everything (vegetables, paneer etc) is home grown or home made. Servings are decent. Food looks clean and healthy. Even though there is no onion and garlic, you hardly miss them.

They have an extensive menu or south and north Indian food, both snacks and meals. The dosas etc look good. I have had the chana bhaturas which were slightly better than average. The north Indian veg preparations are decent, as are the rotis and naans. I find some of the items a tad sweet though.

They have decent thalis, but these are fixed in quantity. They used to be good value before a recent increase in price.

Usually am disappointed with the fresh lime soda as it more often than not turns out flat and I have to ask for a replacement.

They have an adjacent confectionary that serves puffs, pastries, sweets, bread, etc. Some of these are pretty decent and good value. I remember the corn puff and gajar ka halwa in particular.

The place is reasonably well kept. Clean and cool. Service is definitely not up to the mark. The staff are inattentive and rather unprofessional at most times.

I came across your menu on Zomato today. I am a strict vegetarian and do not eat onions and garlic, and so, have never been able to eat Chinese food as I please. Imagine my delight when I saw all the Chinese dishes listed on the Govinda menu, all prepared without onions and garlic !!! I also went through all the comments that have been posted on Zomato and it is clear that Govinda has a very special place in the hearts of all the pure vegetarians. 

I am a resident of Kochi in Kerala but I have many relatives in Kolkata and visit the city every year. Needless to say, I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit to Kolkata and to dining at Govinda.

Krishnaya Namaha.

I am giving this joint a 1 star rating only because Zomato doesn't offer the option of giving a lesser rating. Inspite of being a vegetarian, I found the initial words on the menu shocking, in which non vegetarians were painted as heartless murderers. Though they appear to be the Crusaders for Animal Rights, Govindas capitalises on the sentiments of conservative Hindu and Jain vegetarians, and there in lies my main problem, their omission of onion and garlic from the menu. People should realize that though this restaurant portrays itself as the "Epitome of Religious Serenity" , they basically run a business and just want big bucks. Because of their "inability" to use Garlic and Onion, they use kaju as the base for their side dishes making the food so very rich, it hurts after you eat. So basically, by saving you from the 'sin' of eating animal flesh, they're also ruining your heart by substituting kaju for onions and garlic. Add that to the fact that the waiters don't care and that the service is slower than a wounded sloth, this place is not worth the time and money of the 'unreligious' .

One of my favourite places considering pure vegeterian options with pocket friendly prices. 

a nice family restaurant serving with very courteous staff. one of the specials is the menu. Having its links with ISKCON , and based on Hinduism the menu has been well presented. Though it is impossible to maintain in a eatery all what is supposed to be achieved. 

Nevertheless nice food, nice ambience, an all time favourite pocket friendly family place.

i usually avoid vegetarian restaurants but since it was navratri and i was with family i had to scout for a good vegetarian restaurant! i did ask for a few suggestions from friends but ultimately zeroed in on govinda's - primarily for these reasons - location, ISKCON tag, price and zomato rating! post the experience i am a fan of vegetarian food which i promote - though myself a non-vegan! we had reached at around 7 PM (the time when it opens for dinner) and there was already a long line of people at the gates by the time we left in an hour! we were 6 of us but there was not one 6-seater! the restaurant's decor was unique - including huge wall hangings of the ISKCON movement! the menu was simple and neatly laid-out and the attendants courteous in serving! we ordered items including a kebab platter, chili baby-corn, veg thali, hakka noodles, naan, kashmiri alu-dum and veg biryani! the serving time was one of the quickest and the best part - the food tasted awesome! i would have rated this place an absolute 5 had they accepted cards and had 6-seaters but these are minor glitches! a restaurant must serve good food and must have good attendants and this place scores highly there! the taste of every item was subtle and the after-taste smooth! the hakka noodles specially had a fabulous smoky taste! the veg thali was awesome with the assortments of vegetables, kulcha, pulao, yogurt, kheer, papad and pickles! every kolkatan - vegan or non-vegan, must visit this restaurant for sure! i will definitely for sure!

A soothing place, divine connect, courteous staff, good vegetarian food w/o onion & garlic, very pocket friendly prices....what else one wants! The posh location of the restaurant all the more makes it a favourite or sorts. If your are going alone or two people, An Indian Thali is a recommended option as it will suit both the stomach and the pocket, moreover one can try varieties in that. Some 'A la carte' dishes to order as per my suggestion would be:
Malai Kofta, Paneer Kadhai, Paneer Butter Masala, Lahori Aloo Jeera, Kashmiri Aludum (a must try), Pindi Chana Masala, Dal Makhani, Pineapple Raita (All Main Course)
Pudina Paratha, Kashmiri Nan, Kashmiri Pulao (Roti/Rice)
Cost for 4 will be around Rs. 800-900 (all incl)

P.S. I have not tried items during snacks timings nor have I tried their Chinese. So cannot comment on them. Please go early during weekend Lunch or Dinner to avoid long waiting.

If you are a cultural Indian and you have vrat(eating vegetarian foods)  and you are just bored of eating food of home and you want to eat delicious non veg but you don't want to break your family's heart but still you want to eat some supreme quality veg food .Well there is a place called govinda where you can get all the delicious foods with reasonable prices and they make Chinese,south Indian foods etc and they don't even use onion and garlic and make India's best veg foods. My only suggestion is that they should expand their dining area.

Just the place you would like to visit if you are a vegetarian as no onions and garlic is used in the dishes. Govinda's restaurant is not only an amazing family restaurant but also has two sweets shop and is famous for its variety of sweets and snacks. The paan like sweet (i cant remember the exact name) and the corn chop were very tasty that I had. Also the Govinda Special Thali is quite famous but difficult to finish for a single person though. The quantity of the thali is too much and many wont be able to finish the whole thali. The Govinda special thali has to offer a paneer dish, a sabji dish, dal makhani, rice, two naans, two kulchas, two papads, raita and curd (don't know if missing anything) just at Rs. 240. Pricing wise the restaurant is budget friendly.

The only con would be that one may struggle to get a table on Sundays or any special occasions as the space of the restaurant is somewhat less and requires expansion. They can easily use up unused space outside and could introduce open air dinning.

To summarize, the pros of the restaurant would be :
- Very good food with excellent quantity
- Budget friendly
- Fast serving times
- Has two sweet and snack shops

cons of the restaurant :
- Lack of space
- More effective utilization of space required

If you are a veggie there can not be a better place than this. Though the ambience is simple but the food is just amazing. Not only the indian food is good but even the Chinese is just amazing. The maharaja thali is a luxury . Two people can share the thali. I liked the American choupsey and the dosa. The kulchas and nan were just outstanding.

I did enjoy all the various stuff too....

Also a total bill of 600/- with 5 people (all were stuffed to their limits) was beyond my imagination and I must say it was a total paisa vasool...

All in all a great and memorable experience for me.

Every vegetarian's delight - this is a nice joint which is always crowded. The Hyderabadi Mix veg turned out to be quite different from the usual fare that you get elsewhere. Dal Makhani was also pretty good. Even the run of the mill Alu Dum was very well made. 
While the Pudina paratha was pretty good what I would really recommend are the Pepper Cheese Kulcha & Missi Roti. Instead of going for the standard Roti Naan you must try the variety of breads which are served here.

They have a variety of Lassis which we tried - Khus, Rose & Plain - these were more or less par for the course - nothing outstanding, still worth a try!

Overall experience was very good! Would recommend it to all vegetarians!

I was in the mood for light lite around 4 when just finished a business meeting. My eyes struck the small outlet of Govinda's serving sweets & snacks. So walked in out of curiosity. And I was in for the pleasant surprise! Normal savoury of today @ yesterday's prices! And they tasted sooooo goooood! Since all the items were so delicious, so not naming any one item in particular.

But there was another surprise in store. When i was presented the bill, it was mentioning the amount as "Donation"! Ahem...Ahem.. I wonder whether I can claim my food bills of Govinda's in my Income Tax Returns... Food for thought, Guys!

its a franchise of the iskcon group and i felt its very innovative way to propagate indian culture beyond india,since this chain is operating at many places abroad.the one in gurusaday road is just opp the mainland china restaurant and is an ideal place to go for "swattik" veg food.dont apprehend a litany,although the interior and the uniformed waiters exude religion.masala dosa chana batura,lassi are very well made here.we used to frequent the place every two months or so and blather about as we ate.
there is also a sweet shop outside,where you will find quite a few uncommons.

if you are like me and love good veg food, and would not want to spend the earth for it, this is the place to go.I have had a number of very decent meals here, especially their cheese kulcha which is good, and their chana masala. Also, check out their thalis and their weekday specials which keep on changing. I personally am a fan of their confectionery as well, where they serve up a number of eggless desserts. 

Although I must say, the Chinese is not to my liking, I do like their dosas, especially the dhaniya masala dosa and Rawa dosa. Do try these here. The staff is super-polite and quite fast. Although they have raised prices recently, I still dont mind paying because of the quality of the food.

The special thali is a divine experience.I can't help but go there time and again to give in to my 'sattvic cravings' . The bakery section is good too, especially the vegetable chop and the swiss rolls deserve special mention.


P.S. They don't serve the Indian dishes from 3 PM TO 7 pm and the chinese + south indian fare minus garlic and onion is well worth avoiding. And make sure you share the SPECIAL DOSA with 3 more people.

Govinda's located in Ballygunge just took me by surprise on my first visit there sometime back. Since then it has earned a fan in me as it makes amazingly tasty food without the use of onion and garlic which is really surprising. It is a heaven for people who are strict vegetarians. 
I have had the Indian Thali on both occasions i have paid a visit here. The thali dosent have a huge no. of items but whatever is there on the plate is good. The Chola was awesome, the mix veg was also very good. They serve you till you are full. There's also dessert to top off the meal on a sweet note.
The interiors are good and so is the crowd. There's ample parking space inside the premises. The pricing is very moderate for the quality and freshness of the food. Plus they serve different items on different days of the week.
A very pleasant experience, I would give 4 stars for Govinda's.

Govinda's.. Owned and run by ISKON, it is a great place for Vegetarians. It serves food without Onion and Garlic and therefore caters to a large Gujrati and Jain crowd. But getting all the flavours right without adding onion and garlic is the thing I like Govida's most for. Amazing food especially the Thali and the starters.. and its so very reasonable which is a huge plus point for I guess, everyone?
Four stars from me, if only the decors were a bit better it would have been a five ;)
