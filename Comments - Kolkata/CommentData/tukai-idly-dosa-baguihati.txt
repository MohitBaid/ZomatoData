You must try the special dosa of here. I usually tried the masala, plain dosa, bada, idly evrything and all are  really good. But if u try the special dosa with adding paneer once , you will forget about all the branded dosa stalls in Kolkata. They can't match with the price and quality of here. Kolkata street food rocks.

Well if it has to be breakfast than South Indian cuisine is one of the best choice. This is a small place in baguihati more, which serves hot idlis, vadas, dosa's, uttapams, pav bhaji, dahi vadas etc, basically fast food. Well as I was starving I ordered idlis and vadas which was quickly packed with ample amount of coconut Chutney and hot piping sambhar. The idlis were fresh so was the vadas crisp. A wonderful early morning breakfast to fill up your tummy. Well and the best thing about this restaurant is opens early morning 7 AM and shuts down at 11 PM. So make the best use of this locket friendly place.

U may call it a roadside stall, but its more than that. May not be the best dosa in town, but best on VIP road sure. Uttapam is ok types.  Idli, vada is good, cheese dosa is the option here. They need to work on Hygiene part. All in all great dosa place within rs50/-

Most probably the oldest dhosa counter at Baguiati. They have created milestone  in this area. Visited here so many times. Dhosa, rajkachri etc. Quantity and quality is good. Utrhapam is good in taste.

I visited this place last month and have been visiting frequently since then. Its a decent place for trying South Indian cuisine. They have a small place in backyard where you can sit comfortably and enjoy the food. Taste not the best but better than average. Overall package value for money and time. Two wheeler can be parked nearby.

I did not know the name of the shop properly until I found it on Zomato. For me it was the dosa r dokan at Banguiati more to be very honest. One day when noticed the name and searched was surprised to see them enlisted here. Wow.. That impressed me ...

Located just beside the Banguiati rickshaw stand at the VIP road more.

They are very good with their South Indian dishes more than anything coz I tried that only for multiple times. Live kitchen with a sitting area at the back of the small shop just behind the rickshaw stand. I must admit that they make very tasty food compare to the price.
I mostly go for home delivery and love their dosas. Also the sambar bada ,idly is equally nice. Please try to maintain the standard.

Surely one of the best and most popular south indian corner in the baguihati area..the quality:price ratio is very good..i.e. you will get great food at low price..not a shiny shop but prepares delicious dishes.

If you only consider the taste and price of the dhosa and idly they serve, I can say it is a 4/5 point worthy restaurant. More or less weekly once or twice I drop in at this place while returning from office. The butter masala dosa and the idly is really awesome. Spcially the chutney they put along with it is definitely very mouthgasmic. But they don't have a proper seating arrangement, only a few stools are kept beside the ricksaw stand so that definitely doesn't give you a good impression for sure. However, if you keep aside this part and take the dosa packed  to your home - its really nice.
