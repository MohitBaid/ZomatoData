I used to visit it a lot in my school days. It's lost it charm now a days. Very shabby look. Not at all good ambience. Coming on to food, there were so many varieties. Food was good though with a reasonable pocket pinch.
I loved the pulao which was filled with cashew and raisin.   Chicken bharta was also good. Esp the food rates were very reasonable compared to quality.

I used to visit here a lot. During my college days I came to this place for lunch many a time. They make good food. 
The place looks dirty and unhealthy. But its common in roadside food stalls. This place is food store for many people who depends on it regularly.
Foods are cheap and quite tasty according to its price.
Chicken curry is well made and good, but their fish curry and rice is more popular and also good in taste.

This Gupta Hotel is located on Kesab Chandra Sen Street beside Sai Baba Mandir & opposite to Jadab Chandra Das Sweet shop. This basic roadside hotel doesn't seems so healthy & hygienic from inside but maybe something is in their foods.

Tried their Chana Masala & Roti for dinner. Surprisingly the food came to be very good. Chana Masala was well cooked, gravy was lite but tasty. Little oily but felt very good in mouth. Their roti was soft & fits well with their Chana Masala.

Gupta Hotel may seem very ugly dirty option from inside & outside but their pocket friendly foods are quite good than someone expects. Looking for basic dinner, take away from here is the best option.

It is a very simple and ordinary hotel . And The only thing they are good at is the Egg tarka . They really don't know how to make Dal Fry or Paneer . So overall it is average.
