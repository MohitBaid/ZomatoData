Well... There was a time when NiteSaviour used to be NightSaviour and they really used to save the nights of those who enjoy a late night meal...

I ordered a Nitesaviour special biriyani...

Quantity: much less than any other place with these price range

Quality: what is wrong with these people? I've never ever tasted a SALTY biriyani in my life

Delivery charge: Rs. 40 (too much) 

Delivery speed: I'll say it was ok... 

Was it hot? No... 

NightSaviour has dropped their quality of serving food drastically over the period of one year... 

I've been a regular customer of nearly 1.5 years... And now they have disappointed me so much that now i advice everyone to avoid this place..

Worst delivery service. I ordered food at 12. It came after around 120 minutes and the restaurant kept asking me to wait for a few minutes for several times. They deliver cold food. They don't have any time limit to serve your food. At late night it actually doesn't solve but increase your problems. You don't get food in your hand in time. Even when you say you've got exams.  Neither you can go to sleep nor you have anything to eat. I highly recommend to NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.

Ordered food on 19th Dec 2017 @ 2:36AM consisting of:
2 Cheese Chicken Pizza
2 Oreo Shake
1 Cheese Ball
1 Chocklate Shake (Complementary)
Delivery time was 70Minutes.
Order ID: 1494520539
Basis the order deliver time the restaurant was supposed to deliver at 3:46AM.
However they failed to deliver.
Complained about the same since it was repeat mistake from restaurant hence they offered the ordered food along with refund.
What i actually got nothing neither food nor Refund.
Restaurant and Zomato both played the fraud game with me.

The food was overall good. I ordered a combo of chicken burger, cheese chicken sandwich, nuggets and a 600ml coke. I ordered for french fries though but due to unavailability of french fries they gave nuggets and they took my concern before that which I appreciate. The price was also reasonable for the combo. Delivery was on time. Coming to the food quality i liked the cheese chicken sandwich very much, but the burger was not up to the mark. I think they can improve it further. Looking forward to it.

So today I decided to order pizza for dinner from a different restaurant instead of the regular favourite pizza hut and dominoes. I ordered Night Saviour Special Veg Pizza.It was good I mean they give generous amount of chesse and moderate amount of veggies and the pizza is of regular size. But what I disliked was the pizza base which was hard and overcooked and it felt a little dry.If only the base and the base sauce spread quality was improved it could have been great, all in all the taste was good.

Ordered for one chicken lasagne and a chocolate milkshake (complimentary with zomato membership). chicken cubes were over cooked for my taste, however when contacted the restaurant, they got a exchange for the veg version of it, which I loved. loads of veggies and just the right amount of cheese(for cheese lovers :) )Â 
so,
veg lasagne- 4/5
chocolate milkshake- 5/5
will definitely try there other items sometime.

Ordered chicken cheese pizza, french fries and Chocolate shake at night. Was really disappointed by the delivery.

French fries were chew and not at all crispy. It lacked salt and on top of that, I received them cold. It was just a horror to eat it. Only thing positive was the quantity.

I thought the pizza would be better but I was totally wrong. First of all, they didn't supply any seasoning or chilly flakes. How is one supposed to eat pizza without those. On top of that, the pizza base was overcooked. Even the chicken toppings were pretty less. It felt like eating biscuits with sauce and cheese and toppings. Not at all worth the price they charge. When I wrote to them on WhatsApp regarding this pizza issue, all they replied was "no sir" .

Chocolate shake was so so, best of the lot. It felt more like drinking Chocolate ice cream. Wish it was more cold. Warm shake just killed the mood.

Overall, I feel they should really improve their standard of food they provide and try to deliver the dishes warm.
Delivery was within the estimated time so no complains regarding that.

Nightsaviour is a true saviour of the night! I never have dinner before 2am at night and this amazing joint is the only restaurant open till 4am (there might be others but this is affordable and offers yummy food!)
Rates- pretty cheap (is why you may doubt food quality but please don't they are great!)
Service- great!!!
Complimentary zomato treat- an amazing chocolate shake!
Food quality and quantity- too good for their price!!
I ordered their non-veg lasagna and chef's special non-veg pizza (I had once ordered theirs mixed sauce non-veg pasta too and that was fresh as hell and amazing too!) And the quality taste and packaging of the food totally surprised me!!! They also give you a whole lotta napkins spoons oregano chilli flakes and other necessary condiments or essentials that you could need with the dish you order!
A great joint to fill your tummy late at night and at early dawn with no pinch in the pocket at all!

We ordered french fries, chocolate brownie, coke and chicken cheesy pizza late at night. The pizza was too tasty along with the brownie the price is also reasonable but the only issue was their late delivery. And they forgot our coke inspite of including it in our bill. Except this we were quite happy and satisfied with the food, quality, quantity and the worth for our money.
I would surely order again because I loved Ur food but have to work on your servicing skills.
P.s : never miss out on their brownieð

My order: Non-Veg Night Saviour Special Pizza + Choco Shake (complimentary).

Time of order: 11:45pm
Order delivered at: 12:35pm

Was it hot? Well if Dominos is 7/10 for hotness, this one is 5!

Was it tasty?If Dominos is 8/10 and Pizza Hut is 7/10 this one is 6/10

Pizza: Chicken, cheese, Olives, Corn was sufficient! If you love tomato paste on your pizza, this one aint having that! I dont love that! Crust was too hard to chew, otherwise well baked!

Shake: Normal Chocolate Shake. Skimmed milk. Just the way you would normally get locally.

They get 4 because of the price. â¹200 is what they charge. Modiji and Mamata Di shares â¹30! Total â¹230 for everything, including the delivery.

Can't even imagine what happened that night.We've ordered a sum total of 600 rupees and thanks to these saviours they've agreed to deliver near M.G Road and promised to deliver in 2 hours. We ordered @2am midnight and till 3:45 they've dispatched our food(as per their confirmation). Its been nearly 5am morning and they've not came till location. Delivery man's cell phone was also switched off. When they delivered in location, we saw that there was no pizza in it(which was main among all of them) and when i've complained for it they started yelling that 'you please contact our branch' or 'it must be there my delivery boy can't make any mistakes'.
It was an horrible first experience and not at all interested in second experience.
Otherwise, food qualify was okay and they've delivered in such a distance so 2 stars for that.
Never have such an experience in home delivery restraunts bt you guys please make sure that this won't happen again with anyone.

Thank youð

Yesterday i had ordered the night saviour special biryani and also the complimentary chocolate shake(only with zomato treats membership) .
First the delivery was 10-15 minutes delayed and they had messed up the packing as the top portion of the choco shake had spilled in the plastic pack, thankfully the biryani was sealed and it was only dripping the shake bottle/container,salad and spoon,napkin , i was very dissapointed as when i took out the choco shake the my hands as well as the dining table also got affected.
THE taste of the shake itself was ok to rate a 4 star, but the spill was a major fact.
I was hoping that the biryani could elevate my mood but it was only average for me, the rice needs more flavour, the mutton was also ok, a part of the aloo/potato was bad and i had to dump 1/4th of it , otherwise it would have been ok but it was not for that item for me which should be a restaurant special. All in all an average order for me.

So the other day, being extremely hungry and having tried many of the stuff near kasba decided to go for this place, after a quick glance through zomato.
Interestingly, the place remains open up until the wee hours of the morning, this being one of the few to cater to the hunger pangs of the whimsical.

Having said that I placed an order for the special non veg pizza which was delicious to say the least...I really loved that..
The chicken club sandwich didn't carry the quintessential omelette and extremely quesy with its white sauce. After a while it becomes monotonous.

The service was quick.. Though I feel they bed to work upon the food based on the two items I had ordered.

They have the worst service you'll ever find. We ordered a pizza and got the delivery after 3 hours,that too a cold tasteless one. So if you're thinking of ordering from this place,please don't. They better name theirselves 'Nightspoiler' instead of 'Nightsaviour'. That Would be more appropriate.

Ordered one cheese chicken burger,one chicken mayo sandwich and one cheese chicken pizza from this place today.

Sandwich-- It was a big one...had generous chunks of chicken stuffed between the breads. Tasted very good and was quite filling too... You can try it for sure.

Burger-- Yeah patty seemed overfried maybe..but it was quite tasty man...Yes the lettuce leaves or whatever leaves they used looked stale no doubt...
Better keep a check on it

Happened with me twice in a row that I ordered food in the night and staying not even 5-10mins away they did not deliver nor bother to inform at all. Hence when I placed the order they go about saying 30mins, 40mins and all that Jazz. Don't order from this place if you are really hungry, you might stay hungry all night but they won't care neither will they serve you. The food the first time I ate was good. Change the ways you'll serve people and don't be liars or keep people waiting. Can really take strict action against you guys as I have all kinds of proofs. I really like the food for a midnight snack but you guys just made things worse with this happening to me.

I had a sudden craze for pizza. So I ordered a chicken cheese pizza. 
The quality and the generous amount of cheese was quite great. It had small chunks of chicken which was perfect. The pizza is although a small size(4 slices)
Great place to order when there is a bit budget constrain.

Ordered here from today. First of all , I heard that their brownie is good. But it wasn't. The brownie was dry and there had been less use of chocolate in it. Their cheese pizza , although had a generous amount of cheese and even cheese spread , lacked the tomato sauce base in quantity and quality. I also ordered a red sauce pasta but they gave me a white sauce pasta. The pasta was oily but had flavour in it. The prices are cheap and the only perk is that the food is available at late hours of the night.

Ordered 1 chicken cheese pizza and 1 cheese garlic bread and 1 egg burger.

Pros:
* delivery was on time. 
*the chicken cheese pizza was good and  huge no. Of chicken pieces were there.

Cons:
*only 3pc of garlic bread were there and it was too cheesy for my taste.
*the lettuce/ cabbage piece was rotten.so I had to throw it away. But the taste was average. 

### the cost is too much according to me (total Bill amount was Rs 332 for only these 3 items).

Pathetic service, got my food delivered after 2.5 hours and the food was all cold. The delivery boy didn't know the way and I had to call him hundred times to tell him the directions. The owner does not respond to the call and even when I tried to ask zomato support they mentioned that the restaurant is unresponsive. Never ordering anything again from here. I wish no one does.

They are a little heavy handed with the mayonnaise, but normally that's not an issue for starving people in the middle of the night. The sandwiches are heavenly, especially the Club sandwiches. Pizza have a sweetish taste at times, but if you instruct them to make it spicy it does the trick. The lasagna portion is very small, and made with toouch cheese and very little chicken. But it tastes good if you consider the time.Pastas are very basic, and it would do you good to expect nothing extravagant. 

None of the food is bad. And the service is polite and prompt. So don't go hungry tonight. ;)

I just had double layered chicken burger and french fries. The delivery was before time and that's why you got all the rating. But the quality was below par. Both the layers of chicken were definitely taken out of the fridge and fried hard. Â The french fries were too much salted as if those were dipped into a salt puree before frying. Usually burgers should have a juicy flavor and fries should be soft enough. The chicken-ish flavor was missing as the chicken inside the burger was heavily coated and didn't at all tasted anything. Totally dissatisfied as I think they first need to learn about burgers and fries.

Review update: The first time ordered the lettuce didnt appear to be fresh but I decided to give another chance. And this time I received a completely stale piece of lettuce which completely ruined the taste of burger. I had to throw it and Zomato didnt help either. Hence, I would'nt suggest ordering from here. Downgrading the rating to 2
________________________________________________________________________

                        Nightsaviour - Is it really a saviour or just one of the many other night delivery guys? Are they good enough for their tagline of "Order, eat, repeat" or is it like "order, eat, be disappointed"?Â 
Well, since they are a night delivery place, the first and most important thing is how is the delivery service. And I believe they are perfect with that. The food is generally delivered in 40-45 minutes if it's a small order and 60 minutes if its a big one. Also, the food is delivered warm, not hot, which is acceptable. So, overall score that I will give them is 4/5

Talking about the food itself, it would categorise it in the lower end of mediocre. I ordered a veg cheeseburger and a small cheese pizza (Margherita). The burger had two big issues, one being that there was just too much mayonnaise which was overshadowing the taste of cheese and the patty. I literally had to wipe it off because it was too strong. And, the second issue was with the lettuce, which looked old and soiled. The patty was done well and I enjoyed it's taste and crispiness. Even the bun was grilled well. So, I gave the burger 3 stars but they definitely need to improve a lot of things and I might not order a similar burger again. The pizza, on the other hand, was of standard size, tasted good, it wasn't hot but warm enough that the cheese remained soft. So 4 stars there.

Finally, to talk about the price, that's where they lost major points and I downgraded them to a 3 instead of 3.5. Their, pizza costs Rs. 120 for small and Rs. 210 for medium. With delivery charges it becomes Rs. 140 and Rs. 230 respectively. This is actually costlier than that of domino's at Rs. 119 and Rs. 230 which was a shocker for me. Even the veg cheese burger which I accept is marginally bigger than McVeggie burger of McDonald's was Rs. 105 without delivery cost against the Rs. 80 at McDonald's, inclusive of taxes. So, looking at that it really bothered me. It's indeed not that pocket friendly as people may think. And hence the rating.Â 

Final Verdict, I might only order from the place may be once in a while or in case of lack of options

It was a sports night so had to stay awake till 2.30 a.m and got hungry. Bookmarked Nightsaviour from a long time. Now decided it's time to order them. Opened Zomato app, booked One Chicken Cheese Pizza and a Chicken Lasagna. Delivery time was 45-50 minutes. Both items tasted delicious. Pizza was good size and lasagna was stuffed with chicken. Will definitely order again.

I ordered a chicken burger, fries and coke.. The delivery time was given as 1 hour, but finally got delivered after 2 hours..
The guy who brought my order was too rude, as if it was my mistake he was an hour late, apart from he didn't have the cold drink..
The food was cold, the bun had become soggy, and the fries were cold and oily and soggy as well..
A very pathetic experience, I must say..
So pathetic that I've had to write this review in the middle of the night.

I have just started ordering food from this place very recently, and I must say I am extremely impressed by the promptness, service and food quality and quantity. I don't usually give reviews but I just had to do so today cause each order I have placed with these guys have never been below a 5 star rating. Today I ordered for a chicken lasagna and it was mind blowing. the amount of flavour and cheese was just apt. By far the best lasagna I have ever eaten in KOLKATA. Will definitely recommend this place to all near and dear. PS. Please do open your momo and parantha section as soon as possible so much more orders to place. :). Can"t Wait!

The food was not at all upto the mark. Tell ur delivery boy to not have gutkhas while he is on duty. It was disgusting to see that the water bottles , the food packets were having chunks of gutkhas. And when the delivery guy find out , he just simply wiped those with tissues and he was not at all bothered. Being a hotelier I would say the experience was embarrassing.

The packaging was perfect and food was piping hot.  I was bowled over by how the owner himself made sure that it was perfect.  Me myself being in the hospitality industry could never imagine or had a thought of what he did.  With such strong determination I am sure you would go a long way Abhishek. And BTW the food tasted delicious.  Best of luck

As just a standalone restaurant I would rate it a 2.8/5
But if I give more weightage to its late night delivery and competition it gets a 3.8/5
Ordered a whole lot of food... Here's the review. Read the concise ver. if you're just looking for a place to fulfill your late night cravings
The extensive review is for the foodies but in a language any layman can understand

Concise ver. : great late night delivery and food is good if compared with other late night joints (be it quality quantity or price)

For the foodies: I ordered
Chk. white sauce pasta;Â Chk. macaroni;Â Cheese chk. garlic bread;Â 3 cheese pizza;Â Brownie
1) Chk. macaroni and white sauce pasta (penne) have the same sauce... alfredo / white sauce.. the sauce was very floury while the pasta was overcooked; way too much sauce as compared to the pasta. Flavourful nonetheless, also I received it while it was still hot.
2)cheese chk. garlic bread ... was very hard and cold ... felt a bit sweet at parts which gave it a confusing flavour... wouldn't know why they added sugar in a garlic bread... cheese was good and the quantity is substantial.
3) 3 cheese pizza... again had a sweet taste which was confusing for my palate... cooked well with Â a generous helping of cheese. ..although the base feels more like those readymade Â ones.Â 
4) brownie... nice average tasting brownies with a generous amount of nuts

This place has good food at late night, but after many orders. One thing that sticks out is THE EXCESSIVE MAYONNAISE IN EVERYTHING. MAYONNAISE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR SAUCE IN PIZZA WHICH IT COMPLETELY LACKED. PLEASE USE LESS MAYONNAISE IN EVERYTHING. MAYONNAISE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR TASTE. 
Fries are fine. Burger patty must be improved. Sandwich & Pizza should have less MAYONNAISE please.

I am very upset to give such a bad review on this particuar take away joint. I had recomended this joint to one of my closest friend who had ordered chicken lasagna from here but it was quite to her surprise that they did not deliver the dish on time rather they were giving a complete hoax that they are delivering it within 10- 15mnts. However the time had passed away. The approx time required to deliver from there shop to her house is 20mnts including traffic jam. I am thinking of neither suggesting it to anyone nor ordering from here.

Horrible experience in dealing with nightsaviour....i stay in ruby and their outlet is in picnic garden which is hardly 15 mints in distance. I had ordered my food and they gave me a time limit of 1.30 mints. Still it was fine....as I was waiting for my food. But they didn't reach by time...i had to call them up and they said the delivery boy will reach by 10 to 15 mints. I kept on waiting I had called them up again and they kept on saying same stupid thing  that wait for 10 to 15 mins mam....it was almost 50 mints extra time that I was waiting for moreover it was Sunday evening so there was hardly any traffic and they were giving me completely shitty stories. And finally I had to cancel my order. Why do you name nightsaviour....rather you should name night and time killer. Horrible experience I ever had.

I'd ordered two items from them yesterday night for home delivery. 
French Fries and Chakhna. They always make this Chakhana using nuts and peanuts. But this time they had sent scrambled eggs(I'm a pure vegetarian) instead of the regular one. I called them and asked what have they sent and they said it is chakhna and it has changed. Then I asked them did you ask me before sending it because I'm a pure vegetarian. This is unprofessional and careless. Extremely disappointed.

The garlic bread is excellent. 
The sandwiches and burgers are decent. (Taste subjective)
Brownies are good but have too much almonds which is a bummer. 
Sends mountain dew instead of Pepsi. XD(thus 4.5 stars.)
Albeit as the name says, saves the night. 
A good break from all night long delivery Dhabas. 
Oh did I mention amazing bang for the buck? That too. 
Oh and way better than their closest competitor, santa delivers. 
Cheers,
A. 
Now only if they deliver milkshakes. :3

I'm from England and its nice to find somewhere that can bring me junk food when I crave it at 1am. The food was good, pizza size perhaps a little small but at these prices I can't complain. Taste was great. Definitely will be ordering again, well done.

If ur looking for grubs to satisfy your soul and pocket then dnt think twice to place the order. The Resturant serves from 8 till 3am. From sandwich, macaroni ,pizza till lasagne ...all their food are mind blowing. It's more satisfying when u have a craving for good food at a weirdest hour ð.

The place lives up to its name. Prompt service even late in the night and a total boon for hostel students and people who work late nights and crave for some amazing food. All their items are very good and fresh. I have always recieved hot and fresh food whenever i have ordered online or called for delivery. 
I have only one complaint about one of their items, i.e. the chocolate chip brownie. They do NOT make their own brownie, they have the one which you get at Mio Amore. So, I was a wee bit disappointed about that. Rest was all spot on. I hope this place remains in the city which is devoid of any night life and keeps serving fresh food like this. Would love it if they open more branches in the city.

Ordered twice from this place. The first time round was one club chicken sandwich and a double patty chicken burger.

My initial thought on first seeing my sandwich was "omg so much food yay!", to "why is there so much mayo bruh". Theres just way too much mayo to even figure out what is in the sandwich. Sandwiches are not supposed to have so much mayo. When I pay about 130-140 bucks, I'm not supposed to get a mayo drowned sandwich. Isn't it possible to instead make a sandwich more colourful, with some lettuce, tomato, etc? The presence of excess mayo shows the fact that there is inadequacy in culinary skills that one is trying to hide. 

The double patty burger. All components of the burger were really nice except for the patty. The bun was bright, big and firm, there were sliced tomatoes, onions and lettuce leaves, cheese was right but the patty was horrible. It literally had no chicken in it. It also had a board like texture to it which was very weird to bite into.


The SECOND TIME I ordered from this place, it was a grilled double cheese sandwich, a veg sandwich.

I just don't get why you have to destroy such a beautiful thing like a grilled cheese by putting mayo in that sandwich as well. Which human being does that? I could post you up on redit and you'll end up being foul mouthed all your life for putting mayonnaise in a grilled cheese. 

To top things off, I got food poisoning from the food I ate from here.

Nothing personal really. This was done purely on the aspect of food. 

The service though was so nice. The delivery boy to the person communicating about our order, they were the most well spoken and courteous people. So I appreciate your establishment for that.

Last night almost at 11.30 pm I placed the order of one plate of chicken cheese maggiÂ along with a 600ml bottle of coke. The expected delivery time was about an hour but they delivered my order much faster than the expected delivery time. The wrapping was quite good and they used brown paper wrapping around the bottle of coke to make it remains chilled. The quality of food was as very good. It brought back the homely feelings again. My overall experience was quite satisfactory.

To sum it up from my previous experience to the latest there has been substantial down grade in the service by this much sought for outlet. Yes they still serve late into night however servicing without delivering to the promise made is equivalent to no service at all.
The last few experience that we had with this outlet is nothing but a harrowing experience to even to get the food delivered warm. Promising a time frame for 1 hour the outlet religiously managed to deliver food even later (mostly took more than 2 hrs 30 min the least ) to deliver. Imagine your sandwich cold and fried softened with moisture from the paper bag and the cheese breads with no crunch. Forget the bad taste what worries more is the fact that you will have to take medicines with the likes of antacids before consuming these else you may encounter stomach upsets on the count of eating cold fried food.
If the saga ended there the story would have been different. The guy to deliver comes down giving excuses for delay to be the registered phone to be switched off. Which again sounded pretty blasphemous considering the fact that we were calling the outlet from the same number post the promised delivery time that was not met.Â 
All that the outlet had to say for the next one hour is our guy will call in the next 10 min. Which again was not met and we took the delivery guys number and call him to find out that our phone was switched off and he was trying us for over 1 hour ( liar liar )....funny thing to note we received quite a few missed calls on that number from the outlet though ( guess they were checking whether the phone number was really switched off or not)......Now if we received the missed calls im sure the outlet too was aware that there wasn't ant issue with the phone number.....Im still wondering on how the delivery managed to get the number switched off.
Food received after 2 hrs 30 min / 3 hrs was obviously cold and lets not describe the taste...I delightfully leave it to the imaginations of the readers.
In my Opinion : The outlet has lost its charm and appetite to serve and there is an indigenous loss in the attitude to strive for betterment with its growing popularity and expanse in business.....very very tarnishing a poor development from #NightSaviours to #NightMurderers
Please consider renaming your outlet for good.....Atleast the customers banking on good food at late night will be pinched hard to reconsider our midnight cravings

PS : I couldnt rate any lesser.....but with all my heart my ratings are on the -ve for this outlet once I rated all green

True to its name, Night Saviour is perfect for late night hunger pangs. Pretty good quality and taste of the food, and loads of cheese in almost every cheese dish. Must try the chicken cheese roll, which is off the menu. The fudge brownies are superb! 
Oh yea, and the staff is always cordial. Even when it's 2 am.

The sandwiches are decent and filled with lots of cheese.The maggi is awesome anytime whoever makes it so I don't give much credit to the chef here but it's not his mistake as the soup of the maggi gets evaporated by the time it reaches us.tried the chicken garlic bread it was good.Fried Momo's chutney is awesome.the patty of the chicken burger is not that great .But the best thing about them is that they deliver sutta chakna and soda too lol and everything else till 4am in the morning

Hostel students....late night workers....imsoniacs....a saving grace for all if one doesnt want to drive all d way to Chai break at 2am. A nice initiative of delivering across the city and that too in no time. Pretty quick. Amazing. Staff is very cordial when placing the order. 
The food....since service and variety is so good i dont expect the quality to be great. Though not disappointing. 
#chicken steam momo - wow. Truly good. The sauce was also just apt.Not very spicy but delicious. 
#chicken cheese pizza- base wasnt great and was too sweet. This was for the quick service  
#chicken burger- good. Size was also decent. 

Overall great. Cheers for the service. Reasonably priced too

Yummy snack and fried lip smacking food just at Night Saviour
If the likes of KFC and Mc Donald have bored you to eternity, worry not much! There's a new kid in town and they specialises in presenting American Street Food with Desi Indian twist. Opened as a mere take away and delivery joint, this particular food outlet has flourished ever since and is now a talk of the town.
From burger and French fries to pizza, it has a wide range of menu.
And trust me they give a super fast delivery specially in the odd timing(8pm-4am)when no such food outlets actually deliver.

Things that I frequently order includes pizza, momo, cheese sandwiches.

The food is good both in quality and quantity. Cheese spring roll and Lasagna have always been the best option with great taste. Talking about the pricing, well it has been rightly priced. Delivery is within an hour. Overall it's been a great service. Good work.!! Keep it up :)
