I ordered chicken and cheese pizza, french fries and chilly fried babycorn. 
The order came on time... rather before time.

But the quality and the taste was horrible... horrible..
The pizza bread was so hard like leather. Had to tear it like am tugging on leather. 

Then the french fried were over cooked and hard.

And now comes the icing on the cake.. the chilly fried babycorn was so so so sour we had to throw it away.

So guys don't order from here.

It was my first time, I ordered at 10:44 pm and got it delivered by 11:17 pm at shyambazar. Hence, 5 stars for zomato delivery and the restaurant's swiftness.
Now, coming to food, pretty average, nothing exceptional, but at midnight it's a saviour..

1. Chicken nuggets : 5 small pieces of nuggets with a tomato ketch up - ₹85 too much for the quantity provided. The taste was good though.

2. Chicken mayo sandwich - Way too better for this price. Two whole pieces of bread cut into half and full of chicken pieces and mayonnaise.

3. Chicken cheese maggi : No phenomenal, just maggi tossed with very little cheese and chicken pieces. Pretty average.

4. Gulab jaamun combo : Hey! I grew up in chhattisgarh, you think I don't know the difference between gulab jaamun and paantua? Listen up bud! If you can't provide gulab jaamun, befool other kolkatans, not me, okay!

But Maturely enough, the owner himself called me up and sorted out the matter with utter professionalism and in a very ethical way. Which makes me change my perspective about this restaurant. The food here is good and standard quality is maintained! This is the Go-to place if you are looking for a bite in the Late Hours of the Night!❤

One hungry night i ordered chicken momos and vada pav from midnight bites and was greatly dissapointed.
Food packaging- great
Price- pocket friendly
Quality- bad!!!!
Quantity- standard
My momos were stale... i couldn't eat them at all coz of the stale odour. They did not send any momo soup like any momo selling shop would do! The vada pav tasted standard (more like a grilled sandwich than an actual vada pav!) It was a little burnt on one side as well!
Go ahead and try their pizza though... that is somewhat worth the purchase.

They have introduced new Midnight bites special pizzas both vegetarian and non vegetarian. They are economical and tasty too. Yesterday Around 3 I was damm hungry called my friend for suggestions as I am new in Kolkata ,he suggested me Midnight bite.They have parking facility too....overall too good.thanks Rahul and Midnight bite.outlet is small but neat and clean .service was fast too .

Ordered for a Chicken Lasagne. 

While the delivery was on time and the delivery personnel was responsive to directions, the food was average but has so much more scope of improvement. 

To be particular, lasagne consists of a dual sauce wherin the cheese sauce/bechamel/white sauce was a very scanty amount in this case. Per se, lasgane should be layered equally with both the sauces,  but the white sauce was only drizzled from above. The gratination on top was not done properly and there was hardly any cheese(authentically there has to be mozzarella) leading to a very soggy upper layer and very mushy mouthfeel. Fennel/cumin used in the meat sauce@ overpowered and the lack of fresh basil cumulatively led to a very Indian gravy feel and not an Italian sauce feel. Meat was PLENTIFUL though ! I would recommend cooking the sauce for.a tad bit longer to draw out more moisture from the meat to concentrate the flavour rather than using spices to impart additional flavour. 

Again, lots of potential to become a favourite night delivery outlet if the quality improves at the same price point. Cheers !

I used to think that Pizza Hut delivery is the fastest, but Midnight Bites proved me wrong.
I used to think that all late night restaurants make mediocre dishes, but Midnight Bites proved me wrong again.
Yesterday I suspiciously ordered a Midnight Spl Pizza & Chicken Egg Maggi (playing it safe) and the pizza blew my mind. It was full of cheese,chicken and was steaming hot and my order was delivered under 30 mins.
Today I skipped dinner only to order once again.
I ordered
 Chicken Momos- cannot believe that they made it better than most chinese restaurants.
Egg chicken maggi(since they don't have chowmein) & Chilli Chicken- although the chicken was hard but the gravy tasted amazing.
5/5 for delivery & excellent food that also late in the night. 😃

Rating a food place is actually not in my dictionary but midnight bites forced me to give a thumbs up and people staying awake late should definitely try them...
I ordered for a chicken egg cheese sandwich and the sandwich was really awesome and delivering an order at the middle of the night that too within 30mins of order placement does really deserve an applause...
Hope to catch with midnight bites soon...

very good taste,and price to performance ratio is high.suggestion-chicken pizza was a little bit more sweet due to the sauce used.

I hardly give anyone a 5star, but they earned it, delivering the food in just 30mins is a something even the big food chain fails to provide..
As I asked them to deliver it within 30mins as my main gate was about to get closed..
From Park St to Maniktala, it's a fair bit of distance..
Thank you midnight bites for saving me from midnight hunger..
Now talking about the food..
It was pretty good..
I ordered a chicken cheese pizza..
The bread was fresh..
The chicken were soft in a good size..
Nd the cheese..
They had it all spread around the pizza base..
It was all delicious nd I couldn't have waited much longer as I saw the pizza, it was that tempting..

This is one of the worst places to order from at night. Though they promise good quantity, they dont deliver accordingly. They don't provide value for money food.

Let me get into the details.

I ordered chicken cheese pizza from them and they sent a small sized pizza that tasted not better than the demi pizzas you get at every other cake shop round the corner for 30-40 bucks.To top it I had to spend 150 bucks for this nuisance.

On ordering Chicken nuggets i was provided micro nuggets instead, probably the smallest I have ever seen and that too for 70 bucks plus delivery charge.
So please people stay away from this delivery chain and avoid being fooled.

Getting food delivered in the middle of the night is a huge ask in itself. Thanks midnight bites for that. Next is the quantity I must say it's sufficient. I ordered a chicken cheese pizza which was enough for a single person. The packaging was good and the delivery was on time. Now on the taste part frankly speaking I didn't like it. It's looked like it was made by some amateur cook. The chicken was not fresh. But yes one can order from this place specially at night.

Ordered a chicken biryani and will be judging this restaurant in three aspects. 
1. Food quality - it was up to the mark , the biryani Wala feeling was their.
2.Packing - which was well up to the mark and very well presented .
3. Delivery - the delivery was very quick , got the order in 40 mins.
And to give it a final touch they send me complimentary gulab jamun even. A must try restaurant.

First experience was good.
Delivery was pretty quick.
Quantity of food was very much. At the price they come for, it's very reasonable to say the least. 
But I would rather prefer lease quantity with better overall presentation and more authenticity. Feel there were unnecessary toppings in the pasta and risotto. But the overall taste compensated for the other aspects. 
Pizza was okay. 
A definite try particularly when you're super hungry in the middle of the night because their quick delivery and huge quantity would be enough.

We ordered pizza,  non-veg lasagne, and white sauce chicken pasta. The prices are good and the portion sizes are large. I will rate each food item individually.

Pizza - For me, this was the least impressive of what we ordered, but then I am from the UK and have high standards when it comes to pizza. I think it is the pizza sauce they use + maybe the cheese is not of the best quality, unsure. Still, for the price, you get a decent portion size and it is edible. 

Lasagne - very good. Creamy, thick and tasty. Exactly how a lasagne should be. 

White sauce pasta - Great consistency, not overcooked or undercooked. Very tasty.

Garlic bread - Cooked well, nice taste. 

Overall, very good value for money. I will definitely order again but perhaps not the pizza. I would happily pay a bit more for a better quality pizza. I would suggest looking into getting higher quality ingredients and possibly preparing your own pizza doughs, upping the pizza prices accordingly.

Its the only late night deliverable restaurant in my area. Amazingg. Its a nice restaurant for late night foodies. The veg combo is very budget friendly and tastes good. At 270 the food is sufficient for 1 very hungry person. The delivery service was very experienced. Thanks for a pleasant night. Increase deliverable areas. Very friendly staff. Happy with the new comer. Keep providing excellent service. Cheers

NOTE - UPLOAD GOOD PICTURES OF THE RESTAURANT and DISHES
