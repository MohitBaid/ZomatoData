Went here on Monday(08/01/18) night around 9:00pm. Ordered a garlic bread which was quiet decent but when I asked for the bill I was told that the system is not working so bill cannot be generated. I asked to pay via card which was also denied. Had to pay cash without the bill assuming it went into the waiter's pocket.

Nested in heart of Saltlake, this place goes by the concept of "Small place, Great taste". It has got a quirky decor, the interior give you gritty and crude feel like as of a proper European down the lane cafe. They have specially dedicated a wall to hung pictures from different cities and small towns of Italy which inspires their dishes and its recipe. Even the detailing on tables and chair and cutlery go well with their theme of a proper Italian Cafe. Obviously I loved the ambience and so the menu, it has what not.(esp. the drinks menu...it is never endinggg.. :* ). This restaurant is here to stay because of their hospitality and very well behaved Staff. It's been quite a long time since I have rated a restaurant 5/5 and its ambience & hospitality is not the *only* reason for that.¬†

We ordered Exotic pulled cheese garlic bread from the starers which was recommended by the owner itself and its presentation couldn't stop me from taking #foodporn pic for my Instagram post later ;) , in the main course we tried Vodka Sauce pasta which now I would strongly recommend to everyone, who like me, Lives to Eat good food. (yes...Period!). Both the dish was accompanied by Peach mojito and Bubble gum bubbly, both were unique in their own ways.¬†

P.S. : Enjoy the garlic bread thoroughly in every bite, it will take you back to your Europe Vacation.

P.S.S. : This is going to be one of those restaurants for me where I will be visiting again and again and trying different dishes every time and fall in love with the place over and over again.Visiting soon....

We went on the day of inauguration and called for a pomodoro soup, ravioli and exotic pulled cheese garlic bread. Must say each item was made to perfection and tasted authentically Italian unlike many other places serving the 'Indian italian' food. Recommended for all Italian food lovers to visit this place. It's a cosy little restaurant close to the Baisakhi island. Loved the taste of each item.
