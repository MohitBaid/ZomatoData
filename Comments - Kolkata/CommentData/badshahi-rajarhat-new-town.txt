Ordered food from Badshahi for the first time for group of 14 people. We had order biryani n chicken kasha. Food was good quality and quantity wise. Packaging was nice and the food came along with plates, spoons, water, tissues and salad. Delivery took more than what was expected. Overall nice.

Very bad delivery service. We have been promised to get the delivery within 2:30pm on 29th Dec,2017. But we got the order at 3:21pm. Moreover they deliberately took the full payment even after sending 3 less chicken pieces in 3 biriyanis.

 Very good n nice delivery good package. We ordered chicken biryani family pack. Nice Afghani flavored rice. Good quantity.

Cons: chicken pieces Are not cooked well. Expecting to get much better in next order. Apart from this all good.

Suggestions : plz try to add raita in package rather than water bottle.

This is a new delivery restaurant in Newtown. Their speciality is biryani and it is above average. It's very tasty. The biryani is better than alibaba and lazeez. Meat needs to be a little bit softer. Quantity was sufficient. They provide you with a 500ml water bottle which is nice. Firni is below average, it needs more work. Overall good experience. Keep up the good work.

Good food and great packing.

Ordered chicken briyani for 3 people rice quality and quantity both was great... it has 2 chicken piece and egg and potato in one packet. 

This is my second booking from this restaurant in one week only..

One can try any briyani with chicken kassa. 

I would suggest it to other also.

Best with the quality and quantity. I think more than enough. I was bit stress at office because of work load then I decided to stay late night and have dinner in office only. I ordered and got quick delivery which is not expected,so after having biryani  with my team mates i had some smile on face and reduce stress
 and seems tasty specially when you are hungry.

Delivery was good, promised to provide within 1:15pm and they did. Taste of biriyani is good, the aloo and chicken pieces are delicious. Firni is more like makha-sondesh but the taste was good so no complain. One best thing, last week they missed my order somehow, because of that today they provide the same order without the bill. Appreciate that.

Sunday Special!

Weekends are always meant to be notable. Ain't matter what hiccups you have in your regular life, heart always fancy for something special. Thus, that originated us to decree for Biryani even having our regular office today.

Well, anyone who's a die hard foodie, has biryani in the top of their list. And about us(Bengalis), it's always in the top by default. Thus, requestioned it from a new delivery restaurant named Badshahi. And indeed the quantity was Badshahi enough to throng your tummy full. And the taste was enough inviting to make you still die for this dish.


Totally loved it. Those who don't know about this eating house, I would suggest you can go for it. And thanks to my colleagues who urged me to participate in this moment where I had already my lunch in my bag. 

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato @ Supratik Chakravarty or chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com or supratikspageuniverse-blog.
