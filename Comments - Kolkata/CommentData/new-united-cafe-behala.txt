This is one of the best place in behala to have south Indian food. Around all kind of South Indian food are available here. I have been here many times. It's not a restaurant it's a cafe. You can come with friends and start an adda. Taste of all the foods are up to the mark. Don't expect excellent ambience from them. Price seems to be a bit higher than what should be. They serve without any delay and the service is quite prompt.
Thank you

This place is located just beside the Ashoka movie theater. I have always been in a queue to get a seat at this place. It is indeed a very crowded place; specially after the end of a movie. I had either Masala Dosa or Plain Dosa at this place. Dosa was crispy, the filling is tasty. Price is reasonable.

One of the best south indian restaurants in behala.. it's been a go to place for mothers of most students studying in NGHSS, Behala.
The butter dosa is fantastic and the most famous and the best item so far is the Veg Pollao (yes, that's how it's spelt)

Decent South Indian tiffin available. The dosa was upto the mark but I was not happy with the idly. The Dahi Vada is a bit over-rated at this place; I got a vada that was so dry that I did not consume beyond two spoons.
The ambience is quite challenging yet the service is very quick. I'd suggest it is best to take away.

Being a local boy I have visited this cafe several times since childhood. They only serve south indian dishes of various types, starting from wide range of dosa to dahi vadas. The price is reasonable or I might say its much within budget for anyone. After may days had dahi vada over here and just loved it. The taste was superb and the best part was they serve dahi vada with crushed kaju and raisins on top. This cafe is a must try for all for those who havnt been there.

‚Ä¢So, I've been hearing about this place called "New United Cafe" situated in manton, kolkata from many people since a very long time. So, though of paying a visit to this place. 
Its a restaurant offering all kinds of south indian food such as different kinds of dosas, uttapam, vada and many more. People basically come here to grab a quick bite of food as the place gets really crowded in the evening and you may have to wait for your turn as the seats are limited. But the main thing that attracts the crowd is their food. They provide really good food along with affordable price and ya the service is really fast and they serve you as soon as you place your order which is a big yayyüëçüèª ( who likes to wait when you are hungryüòú).
I tried the " Butter Paper Plain Dosa" and " Sambar Vada" and I loved both the items‚ù§Ô∏è.

Have been visiting this eatery since my childhood¬† with my parents. Best south Indian hub in the locality. Love their thin and crisp masala dosa and dahi bada - my all time favourites. Very impressed with the south Indian food served here. Decently priced. Staffs are not so neat and clean but are very responsive. No gst added extra. Parking for 2 wheelers available. Four wheelers can be parked opposite to this cafe and outside Sarat Sadan. Please do try their coffee. It's very refreshing. Costs 20rs but worth it. Air conditioning not available.

Have been a regular here since long. Really pocket friendly. Nice staffs and has a old cafe ambience. Would recommend if you want a light south Indian snack. They serve real crisp dosas. A favourite of mine would be the plain onion dosa and dahi vada and the veggie pulao. They serve the pulao with a coconut chutney. And the pulao is available only in the lunch hours. Situated just beside the Ashoka cinema hall in Behala, it is easy to locate.

Though I do not like South Indian food that much but this place brings back a lot of memories from childhood when mom used to get takeaways. The vada is really awesome and you should definitely try the dosa. You might find some inconsistencies in the chutney though, where some days it might be a bit hotter than usual.

I still hv very distinct memories of this place... The smell of the Pulao nd the sizzling of the tawas on which dosas was prepared is something which can never be forgotten... Prices is also very decent... The most recommanded items are no doubt Pulao, Butter Paper Onion Dosa, Onion Masala Dosa nd also the Coffee... Hav nt yet stopped goin there till nw nd I doubt if i will... Cheers!!!!!!

This is the first ever South Indian eatery in Behala. Located at a minute walk from Ashoka Movie Hall , this place usually draws crowd which consists of generally the movie goers. This is non Ac but a cosy place for a quick bite. Seating is available but there is usually a wait here. Has a seating capacity of around 25 eaters . Fresh and clean food is served but the  taste is moderate , not at all disappointing. Price is reasonable. Idli, and various types of Dosha, Vara, and Coffee are available here. Bill is non taxable.

New United Cafe
         629,Diamond Harbour road,Behala

The southern part of India has a whole different cuisine to their name. In India food reminds you of home,and if you are stuck here in the eastern part of the country,then you miss home. 
In Behala,your search for second home ends. "The home" to your belly is situated just behind the Ashoka cinema hall,right in diamond harbour road. A local drive in which serves authentic delicious south Indian food. Considering it is a local food joint which provides sitting place,does not have much of a d√©cor to mention but the food makes up for it. 
They win your heart just with their dosas.
I personally prefer the masala dosa that they serve,but the ones who love butter,please go for BUTTER ONION MASALA DOSA. The butter drips off the crispy dosa,and the masala aloo with the extra onion is just the cherry on the cake. The sambar and the coconut white chutney will surely take ur taste buds to a ride to the south. Their dahi bara is also good but, keep a last bite of the dosa as it's their best. Now the best news,they serve all dishes,mostly under 100 bucks. Pocket friendly destination to top notch south Indian food

I have been to this place since nursery days. This place serves the best south indian food in behala. It is a small shop just adjacent to behala post office (landmark being Ashoka cinema hall). Every food available here is just superb. One can never complain about the quality of food that they serve. It will be hard to recommend any special item. But if you are really hungry and is a rice lover like me go for veg pulao (available only till 1:30 pm), you won't be disappointed.

Located on D.H. Road , just beside asoka cinema.It's a small place bt always packed with people.they only serve south Indian food and the food they offer actually taste good. Though d restaurant looks shabby bt d food we had was really tasty and neat. We ordered 2 plain paper dosas which was served with d chutney And sambar daal. D chutney was so tasty that we could not help bt asked for a second service. And Pocket pinch was minimal. Some how this place took me on a time machine ride to those days when I used to survive on limited pocket money and visited this kinda small food joints to treat my taste buds...Good old days !!!

I have been eating at this cafe since I was a kid and over the years the quality of the food served here has gone down the drain. The sambar looks like dirty dish water, misses any semblance of seasoning and has a few vegetables strewn in it. The dosas are listless, often without crunch with wayyy too much oil for one's liking. The place is dirty, cockroaches roam bravely across tables. The food is priced a little high considering the quality that they serve, service is quick and the place is always crowded. Wonder why!

New United Cafe is one of the popular food joints in the Behala area. This place serves you with all sorts of south indian cuisines. This was situated near to my school so had visited there a numerous times. Their Katta Rice is my favourite. The other items are just above average. Seating is not so good. Price is a bit on the higher side. Quantity is also less but no doubt about it's quality. So a 3 from me.

This restraunts has been by the side of Ashoka Cinema Hall since the beginning of time it seem, at least for me.Nothing much has changed in terms of interiors or the staff, except the variety in menu has increased and prices too.Though it is still pocket friendly in terms of the quality offered.Been to this restaurant many a times over the years, and the quality never fails to satisfy .
Specificks of each dosa is so precious that your taste buds would easily identify them.Love all South Indian snack items from here.
One small issue though is that the waiters do ask through there body language for tips, though the blatentness is no where near to some park street legendary restaurants.A good place to have some tiffin as we say .üòÇ

WHAT NO TO EXPECT :
‚Ä¢ GIGANTIC DOSAS, instead they're tastier
‚Ä¢ FANCY DECORATION, AMBIENCE
‚Ä¢ FINE DINING.

Apart from that, I would like to mention, please try their Onion butter masala dosa...it's just luscious.

This place is the original kolkatan fast food centre in a lucrative market location in Manton, bang near the Ashoka cinema hall. The place is easily more than thirty years old but still has an undiminishing clientele throughout the day and evening, 365 days a year and that is no mean feat. 
It serves crisp, potato filled, tasty dosas really fast and hence it is tagged the original fast food centre of behala area. Apart from dosas, it serves other south Indian items including soft mounds of idlis, crunchy vadas and palate-tickling dahi vadas. 

Don't forget to have the south Indian style coffee there as well. Tastes better than modern coffee joints.

this place is from the 80s or probably even before.... my school was right next to it.... national gems in the 80s used to be there where i studied the nursery classes only and hence the place was special to me.... i remember eating there as a kid sitting on the table top with my parents.... probably when i was 5....hence i was glad to see a high rating for the place after almost 30yrs....thats Behala for u.... or kolkata for u.... small places retaining the quality for years.... so i wanted to visit and find out how its been.... took out my best buddy.... my enfield on a rainy afternoon.... went there.... got two masala dosa and two dahi vada packed.... simple enough.... bill was only 200.....bangalis are a little addicted to south indian food and somehow this city has always dished good quality dosa s n idlis n vadas always.... now let me tell you about the place for all who are yet to visit.... its bang on the main road right beside ashoka cinema hall.... pretty spacious place with long tables with marbel top.... no fancy stuff.... but clean enough to sit and eat.... and on a rainy afternoon it was still full and people taking parcels away... i knew i was in for a good treat.. while my order was being cooked i spoke to the uncle at the reception who probably is the owner or the manager.... i told him about zomato and their rating.... guess what they hav no clue about zomato.... i gladly opened it on my phone and suddenly got mobbed by all the staffs.... smiling faces under the thick typical south indian moustaches.... at least some of them.... showed them the pics and they felt proud.... after i came home.... we dished it in the plates and the quality was just top notch...... the sambar tasted amazing and full of flavor.... the white chatni was as thick as it can get..... a dosa as big as i could only eat 70% of it..... the small bite of the dahi vada had me closing the eyes in pleasure.... it was sex inside ur mouth.... kudos and thumbs up to new united cafe....the simplicity of these places can teach us a lot... while the dosa got all soggy and lost its taste bt thats obvious.....guys....dnt bring in acs... dnt change the decor.... dnt change anything.... u helped me relieve my childhood for a few hrs which is priceless.... few things shud stay they way they were.... for ever

A great place for all the South Indian food lovers. The Masala dosa and pulao of this place are a must try. However, the atmosphere isn't very friendly with just mere benches and one has to share the same table with others. The food is lip smacking and I prefer parceling food from here and eating at home.

A no nonsense South Indian joint!

They have few tables, but their service is so quick that they are able to serve their orders in almost no time...and in no time you're done with your meal!

As far as food is concerned, its lip smacking delicious! Haven't had such good south Indian in Kolkata. I had Butter Onion Masala Dosa - crisp Dosa oozing butter with slightly fried onion and abundant Masala inside, and Butter Sada Dosa - a little too much butter if you like that! The chutney and Sambar are good too! Vadas and Idlis and Dahi-wadas looked amazing too, would like to try them!

Price wise also it's quite good!

Overall the best place to go for a quick South Indian Snack :-)

Last Sunday I visited here. It is very famous for it's quality south indian food. Actually as per my knowledge it is the only south indian restaurant present at Behala. We took masala dhosa, which cost only rs. 50/- per plate. Apart from all south indian dishes, it's speciality is its veg polao, which only serve at lunch hours.

Tucked up conveniently close to Ashoka cinema hall, this is probably the best option for having some proper south Indian food. I visited this place almost after six years and ordered a masala dosa. The size was huge at such a cheap price, the dosa was crisp and filled with a tasty and spicy potato mash. The sambar and coconut chutney were really commendable. 
Recommend? Yes !

One of the best South Indian food joints in Behala I would say.  It is located on DH Road just beside Ashoka cinema hall.  The place is very neat and clean with a fairly large dinning area.  The is no ambience though.  Highly recommended restraunt if you want to get taste of true South Indian food.

A first class south indian restaurant beside ashoka cinema hall. A very familiar childhood place for me, though the restaurant may not seem to have a "classy restaurant" look, but trust me they serve one after another mouth watering south indian delicacies at the most reasonable price. Worth mentioning are the veg pulao and the vada besides traditional dosas.

Been here on most of the durga puja at least once with my parents, and also many other times. Although the place doesn't have AC and is definitely clumsy, but the taste of good food at an affordable price keeps customers come again and again. However the take away option has become quite popular, so i would like to request the management to make some note of it. The line is not always properly maintained. For this reason both the dine-in customers and take away customers have to wait more time.¬†
With proper management this could be easily solved, else this place is good,

I have been to this place quite a few times since my childhood whenever South Indian cuisine has been in my mind as this is the only descent South Indian food joint in the whole of Behala. Its a small joint with around a capacity of 30 people to accommodate. Been the same in d√©cor and service since ages. It has an open kitchen where you can see your food getting cooked. Over the years the quantity has decreased but the quality still remains the same. The menu card attached here at zomato is not all they serve. They have a few variety in each items and they have a lot more items to serve. A must try place and is super pocket friendly.

New United Cafe is running since childhood days of my parents. Its one of the oldest food place in Behala. The reputation is high and they serve likewise. They are known for their South Indian dishes. The place is always packed with customers eating some delicious South Indian food. The place is located just beside Ashoka Cinema Hall in Behala, D.H.Road. The place is quite famous and you wont have any trouble to find this place.

Ambience:
No ambience as such. Just few wooden tables and benches fit in a small place. There is a open kitchen where you can see your dosa being made. The place is pretty old and they have kept the same.

Service:
The staffs there are working for years and they are expert in what they are doing. The service is good and fast. The staffs are friendly and treat you well.

Food:
You will get some awesome food and these are few of my favourites:
#Masala Dosa
#Sambar Vada
#Utthapam
#Pulao

These are my options when I visit the place.

Last words:
A definite place to go as you would experiece the classic food place of Behala. The taste of food would not disappoint you at all. If you wanna eat some South Indian dish and you are near Behala, this is the place for you.

4/5 for serving great food for years.

A very busy cafe. And an old one too.
But still not so clean and very limited items to eat.
The dosa was literally soaked in oil.
The vada was also not very tasty as in other South Indian cafes or eateries.

This place is a gem. 

Veryy uncomfortable sitting but veryyy endearing food. 

When you walk by this joint, you'll catch one heavenly whiff of the smell of Dosas crisping on a giant pan and it would immediately lure you in. 

They make one of the best dosas in town. And the Sambhar is so good, you might want a whole tub of it; it's a little mild but packed with intricate flavours. The masala filling in the masala dosas is enough to feed a family of four but tastes so scrumptious that you're actually gonna greedily gobble up the whole huge portion all by yourself. XD

Try their pulao. It runs out easily, get in there by 1-2pm, otherwise there's no pulao for you. But do try it if you get it, it will make you happy. Just try it. 

I'm just so glad that this place exists. :)

Been here many times since it's pretty close to my place. Although this place is devoid of an air conditioner, the dosas are lip-smacking. They also make wonderful idlis. You'd never find the seats empty because of the reasonable rates they provide your dosas at. Very cringy and noisy, but if you overlook the ambience and the seating arrangement and pay more heed to the empty stomach that needs to be filled, you'd not be left disappointed. A veteran at offering South Indian delicacies to residents of Behala.

Each and everyone living in behala will be knowing about this eatery for decades now . This South Indian cafe has been providing delightful stuffs like dosa,idli,samvad,sada bada for years now . It is amazing to see how consistently they have maintained the crowd and their quality . 

There's not much to say about the ambience as thetes nothing much . You just go in for a snack and you order and the food comes very fast and you eat and you go away . The seats are basically long benches so you may be accompanied by other people . Many years ago this used to be the custom but nowadays there's no dearth of cafes .

So, why this review ? Frankly , I just wanted to write about this place and just give a word out there about its existence . Probably people living outside behala will not come here but if you happen to come by you can surely try it out .

The dosa is sold like hot cakes and there are just absolutely fantastic . By personally I like the sada vada and uthapam the most . And I keep reliving my childhood memories each and every time I go there .

This place is always my first choice when i am hungry & fill my tummy with good south indian food. This place has nothing to offer when it comes to ambiance. People go there just to eat. Its mostly crowded & most of the times you wont even get place to sit comfortably. But the food is great there. I love their dhosa & dahi bora. Even though most of the items in the menu wont be available there all the times but this place is worth trying out though recently they increased the prices a lil high.

Been here a lot. Their Dosas and Dahi Vadas are to die for! Today was no different. We were in the vicinity so visited here (for the umpteenth time). While I ordered Butter Masala Dosa, my friends ordered Dahi Vada and Idlis. And yes no South Indian meal is complete without a cup (or rather a glass) of Filter Coffee.¬†

Masala Dosa was as usual delicious. But today it was made with lot of oil. Though it tasted good, still I would recommend to visit here in the early hours or in the afternoon. Never visit here in the evenings as its the peak hour and the quality of their spread decreases considerably. Now coming to the Idlis, my friend didn't like it much. He swears he has tasted better elsewhere. But the one who took Dahi Vada was immensely satisfied. What made me surprise is their iconic filter coffee. Earlier it was quite good, but, nowadays they seem to have compromised with their quality.¬†

All in all, this place is a great option for a quick grab & bite. Don't expect anything for any ambiance (there hasn't any). This place is mostly ideal for quick takeouts.

I had been to this place last year and I would like to say that this joint is a very popular south indian joint in behala. Having been to this place since 1990 i have always liked its masala dosa. The sada vada which they serve is also quite a yumm! delicacy. Service is quick indeed and it is very pocket friendly. The only thing is that they should work on the furnishing of the place which would enhance the appetizing ambience.

THIS OUTLET HAVE TAUGHT BEHALA TO HAVE SOUTH INDIAN FARE.NO COMPETITION COULD STAND NEAR IT IN THE LAST THREE DECADES.
I AM HAVING FOOD HERE FOR THE LAST 29 YEARS QUITE REGULARLY.
YES IT IS STILL VERY POPULAR AS THERE IS NO OTHER SOUTH INDIAN JOINT FROM TARATALA TO JOKA.AND THEIR SERVICE IS VERY QUICK AND CONVENIENTLY LOCATED AND PARKING IS AMPLY AVAILABLE.MORE IMPORTANTLY POCKET FRIENDLY.
BUT THEIR QUALITY OF DOSAS HAVE DETORIATED AND IN AN AGE WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY GOOD DOSA JOINTS IN THE CITY,IT IS JUST AN ORDINARY DOSA IN TASTE.
THE WORST PART IS THE SAMBHAR AND COCONUT CHUTNEY BOTH IN TASTE AND INGREDIENTS,IN SAMBHAR YOU WILL COME ACROSS MOSTLY LAUKI AND IN CHUTNEY THE NAME SEEMS TO BE COCONUT BUT PROPORTION IS PRETTY LESS.
THEIR VEG PULAO DURING LUNCH REALLY SELLS WELL AND IS A GOOD MEAL OPTION FOR A CHANGE.
SOME UPGRADATION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED.

Kolkata‚Äôs South Indian fare is often ignored, but there are non-descript and hidden joints all around if you have the heart to look. This one, situated on Diamond Harbor Road, next to Ashoka Cinema, is a steal for the prices they offer. The Dosas are really amazing and you can order almost anything off the menu ‚Äì be assured the quality will be fresh and yum. Their Sambar is one of the best I have had and their chutney is fresh, demanding to be licked off the bowl. You can pair up you Dosa with Sambar Vada or Dahi Vada ‚Äì which are both delicious ‚Äì and get back to me if your bill crosses the 100 rupee mark. I guarantee that it won‚Äôt.

This is perhaps the oldest south indian food joint in behala. I have been eating here since childhood. Though many years have passed but the quality of food they provide is still the same.

This is perhaps the oldest south indian food joint in behala. I have been eating here since childhood. Though many years have passed but the quality of food they provide is still the same. This joint serves the best dosa. I am also very much fond of their sambar that they supply with the dishes. The unique taste that it has can be found nowhere.

The cafe used to be clean and tidy once, but no more. I didn't feel like going in there any more but this friend of mine took me along anyway. What I did realise is that , inspite of the bad interior and no a.c. and a market like atmosphere, the food is good, really good. We had butter masala dosa, butter paper masala dosa and dahi vada. And all of them tasted equally great.

I have lots of fond memories of this place.since long ago, wen i was a kid, i used to visit this food joint with my mother on my way home. So i can say that the quality and quantity of the food here has gradually changed from being super excellent to very good. Nevertheless, they serve quite good south indian food here.Though not too of a hygenic place,the service is quick and the ambience, below average . The place cn is congested and large tables are placed whr u may hav to sit with strangers in case the place gets overcrowded. Nw coming to the food, The masala dosa here is a must try! With ample potato, peanuts and onions, the smooth masala is a perfect complement to the crunchy and delicious dosa cover. The coconut chutney is good but the quality of sambar is not as same as it used to be. My personal favorite is the veg pulao. This south indian style "non-sweet" pulao is really a good lunch and my fav is the raita tht they serve with it.! If u visit there on a wintry morning u oughta try their coffee which is equally delicious! Nyc place and a complt value for money!!

My first south indian food experience is with this place. So normally holds a special place in my heart. I might be a little partial but frankly it is worth it. No ac no cozy seats or great ambience. The food does all the talking. Pulao is good. I love their sada dosa and paper dosas. Raita served with pulao is tasty and healthy too. The plates had always been clean( i am a hygiene freak). But what i dont like is their dahi vada and alu bonda. Its kind of not that good. They should keep pulao even at evening for rice eaters like me. The location is just beside asoka cinema hall and the prices are very cheap. 
Cost for two is around 100 bucks. Believe it or not its true..

I remember updating a status on facebook a couple of years back which said ‚Äúno expensive or high standard coffee shop in the world can match the taste of filter coffee served at local south indian eateries‚Äù and that status was dedicated to New United Caf√© near Ashoka cinema hall, Behala. 

When I just want their coffee (which I can only describe as liquid gold and which is hard to get during the evenings) and nothing more to eat, I usually stand outside and sip at my coffee to avoid tipping. The coffee costs just Rs 15 so how much am I really supposed to tip? 

The dosas are brilliant, and very reasonably priced, but Tirupathi fast food Center on the bang opposite side of the road sells better and cheaper idlis (Rs 18 for two idlis. Here at united they cost Rs 25 per plate).

It‚Äôs an eating house where the gentry is very varied and do not expect the restaurant feel while you are there. Having spent my entire life here, all the servers have become very well known to me Go only for the brilliant south indian food. And don‚Äôt forget to tip well!

The best Masala Dosa in the city. The best chatni and sambhar. The taste hasn't changed over the years, it's the same. Just too delicious! What else you can ask for!

The place does not have much space. Very chaotic. It gets particularly difficult to sit and have your Dosa during summers, as this is a non-air conditioned dosa cafe. You might have to share your table with others, but the service is fast, so you do not have to wait for long. Quick bite.

The place is small and compact. If u plan to go with a friend be ready to sit beside unknown people as they dont have enough tables. The food here is really nice as per the price which is the reason i always keep on visiting this place with friends. I always order masala and onion dosas which are my favourites here... The quantity is really good.

The best place to have South Indian cuisine around my house. The shop may look shabby from outside, but makes awesome dosas, idlis and uttapams. The restaurant is very easy to locate, situated just next to the very famous Ashoka Cinema Hall, in Behala.
My favourite is their Dahi vada and Paper butter Dosa. 

Though they make very limited food, so if you're hitting this place late, few items might already be over.

I am bigggg fan of thick south Indian white chutney....and its like an istitution of it...be it crisp dosa....soft idly..flavorsome sambaar( with loaaauudzz of veggies)uuff these delicacies is just hypnotizing...the amount u get for that cheap price is also an attractive feature...the ambienece is nothing fancy....u will see ur dhosa being made in front of you...it has a old world charm along with great hygiene and freshness of food....ohh!! The coffee is also a must try...in short go with a monster like hunger and I promise u r gonna have kill ur diet chart...give everything a single try...it will really unite our hunger and taste bar...but don't go late....it runs out of stock for some items within 8pm only...

This place has been serving south Indian food in Behala from a time when there were very few or may be no other south Indian eateries around.
I remember having there masala dosa when it was priced at Rs.14 !!! Mostly thronged by cinema goers as it is right beside the Ashoka cinema hall,this place serves decent food which is much better than south Indian food served by other eateries across the D.H.Road. The place is overall okay and cheap but as told by a fellow foodie,don't be bothered if a stranger is already sitting at the table where you are to sit,though many other tables and seats might be empty around :P

The best place to have south indian in behala. The look of the place is not very attractive, but trust me they serve you good food. The behavior of the staff and the quantity of the food is great. If they improve the look and the decoration, they will be flooded with customers.

Heaven for me :D
Whenever I set up my mind for South Indian food, I can smell this food place. A very good servicing with a very good food. :) Pocket friendly yet quality food they serve. ¬†Specialized in dhosa. I love their Butter masa dhosa personally. One of the oldest & the only finest south-indian food place of Behala. Have been eating here since my childhood days and would prefer this place over many other to have a snack with my friends/family

Location :- Just beside ashoka cinema hall near behala manton.

Ambience:- Its a old style eating house. Dont get surprised if you find a stranger seating just opposite of you in the same table and ordering food.

Food:- Speacialized in dosas . Though the size of the dosas has decreased over the years. But the taste has remain the same. Onion masala dosa is their signature dish and also the tea.

Pocket pinch:- 150 for two

Conclusion:- A pocket friendly south indian eating house. Mostly attracts the cinema goers nearby.

I really like this restaurant for the south indian food. Its a little cramped place and you might have to share your table with the strangers.¬†

Of the menu, I really like the masala dosa, my all time favorite. Then comes the veg pulao which is served with raita and I like it also. Its sad that they do not serve the filter coffee in the ¬†evenings.

It's a renowned South Indian Cafe of Behala ..¬†
Veg Pollao, Masala dosa, Onion Masala dosa, Onion Masala Uthapam are best .Dine-in area is not so good. It's non ac and not so comfortable, not suitable for family dinning.Good for take away ¬†.

The only stop for good south Indian food in Behala. The Dosa, dahi vada and veg polao are an absolute beauty. This is not a kind of place where you would enjoy family dining. The rating is purely based on food for parcel. This is great for take away, or having some quick snacks after a movie show at Ashoka cinema hall just beside it.

Situated  beside Asoka Cinema , this is   the common place for  South  Indian  food for us  ,  the  residents  of  Behala  ever  since  the  90's.......  the  place  is  a  simple  one    with wooden   table  and  chairs  and   the  delicious  aroma  of  the   South   Indian food  filling the  air ! Had their crunchy plain  dosa  and yummy  masala  dosa with    quite  tasty   fillings  innumerable   times  and  also the   uttapam and  vada   and  idli! The  food is   simple   yet  truly  delicious!  Another  item  I  like  a  lot  is  their  vegetable  pulao  accompanied  by     raita  , sambar  and  coconut  chutney...just  too  good! The  service  is  good  ,  the  waiters  are  polite  and  refill  the    sambar  and  chutney   bowls several  times...  However  over  time     they  have  got  really   busy   with     the   increasing  flow  of  customers  and   this  rush   shows  in   their  work  sometimes  ,  resulting   in  the  lack  of  the  flavours that  we  had   cherished   for  so   many  years  now! But still   a  favourite  place  nearby  for  good  South  Indian  food! The   pocket  pinch  is  not  much ,  I  would  consider  it  quite  affordable.  Hope   they   maintain  and  improve their   quality  and  keep  up   the   good  work! Try  this  one  if  you  are  nearby  and  is  in  the  mood  of  trying   out  some good  dosas!
