The Biryani is light and tasty.
Chicken Nazakat works best roti. 
Basically I spend the New Year with my family and food from Jadu Kadai and had wholesome meals.
P.S All food were home-delivered as we couldn't go out. Thanks for the great food. :)

The restaurant being just within 500m from my house ,  is just the perfect place to order from whenever i wish to eat good chinese food all of a sudden. I have been to the reataurant and the ambience is good. Now coming to the food part , they offer a variety of chinese and mughlai items and both are equally good. The kebabs are really well cooked n tasty too. They serve an item called Sizzling Chicken which is really worth ordering. Once I ordered Schzwan chicken is really too spicey so make sure to tell them how spicey you want it to be. I have been ordering food for more than 2 years now and they have maintained a good quality of food. The only thing I would say that the quantity of gravy they provide during home delivery should be a bit more. As per me , I definately recommend this restaurant.

This restaurant is one of the popular names in Behala Chowrasta , and have been so for the last 6-7 years . Situated on D.H.Road , the entrance to this restaurant is a bit hard to find for someone who hasnt been there earlier . There is no parking facility at all . So public transport is the recommended mode of conveyance if anyone wants to visit this restaurant . The entire restaurant is on the 2nd floor , and the stairs leading to it are quite narrow and much steep .
.
There is not much decor in the restaurant either . And the seating capacity is at the max 25-26 people . Though the lighting is bit tricky and it creates quite a trance like ambience if visited after sunset .
.
The staff here is well mannered and well informed . I have been visiting this restaurant for the last 5-6 years , and some of the staffs are here from the beginning , so they have a decent knowledge on the menu and how to behave with guests , which is a definite plus point .
.
Now coming to the food , we ordered Red Garlic Pepper Chicken and Red Hot Chicken as starters . We had to wait near about 15 minutes before the food was served . Red Garlic Pepper Chicken looked delicious . It had a great spicy taste and the chicken pieces were also quite big . It had a perfect blend of sweet and sour taste . Red Hot Chicken smelled much appetizing and was loaded with bell papers and it was much spicy . it certainly lived up to its name in terms of its taste and the way it looked .
.
As main course , we ordered Chilli Garlic Mixed Noodles , Schezwan Chicken , Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice and Hong Kong Chicken . I was really surprised at the quantity of both the Noodles and the Rice , it was more than enough for any single person , even an avid foodie like me couldnt finish it and being a middle class boy , I requested the staff to pack whatever we couldnt eat and they were very cordial and cooperative in doing so . The noodles were really hot and smelled of garlic like an authentic chinese noodles should . But I felt it lacked a bit of Salt . The Fried rice was much decent , and had quite an ok number of chicken , egg pieces and few prawn pieces as well . Hong Kong Chicken was decent . It had the sweet and sour taste of a generic chinese chicken dish one would expect in any restaurant , Though the gravy could have been a bit more spicy . Schezwan chicken was good . The chicken pieces were big and the gravy was loaded with onion and dry chilli . It tasted really spicy and I would recommend it as it goes with both noodles and fried rice evenly . It had both great taste and was much more in quantity than I had expected .
.
We didnt order any dessert as were full to our maximum capacity . I must admit , for such a pocket friendly priced menu , the quantity was way more than we expected . Atleast 2 persons can eat any single dish ordered from either the starters or the main course .
.
In the end , I would say , this restaurant delivers exactly what it promises . It is a middle class restaurant with a decent menu variety with very much pocket friendly priced dishes with a more than expected quantity . It doesnt boast of anything fancy , but it will definitely leave a smile of satisfaction on your face when you consider the Price , Taste and the Quantity at the same time .  A definite Yes for me as a family outing joint .

Firstly would like to rate negative. This is the most disgusting Restaurant I ever had in Kolkata.  I ordered this through swiggy and here is what I got.  A burnt Tandoori chicken with a leg size of just 2inch. May be not even that. It was simply tasteless and fully burnt.. As you can check the pic.  Guys just save your money and have food from roadstalls.. Even they are better than this shit.

This is the first time I ordered through Food Panda, to be frank I dont see why should I deal with them instead of Swiggy or Zomato. 

Before talking about the food, the delivery was delayed, Food Panda customer care said its the responsibility of the Restaurant and they were checking and yes they were updating me. Given the fact that I was charged Rs 70 for Container Charges and Rs. 10 for Delivery Charges, this is not acceptable.

I ordered the following..
Shredded Crunchy Crispy Chicken - The crispiness was ok considering the fact that if you are dining in the restaurant the item always gets tricky. Should be served and eaten hot.
Red Garlic Pepper Chicken - This was quite good.
Prawns in Oyster Sauce - The prawn was very nicely cooked and i liked this dish the most.
Chicken in Black Bean Sauce - This looks awful but taste wise its ok. I would not recommend this for everybody. If you like to experiment with your food go for it otherwise you can give it a miss.
Chicken Fried Rice - I would like to talk about the quantity more than that of quality. The quantity is more than enough and much more than the price worth.

Ordered mutton biriyani 2 plates, chicken biriyani 1 plate and paneer pulav 1 plate. The mutton biriyani was pathetic. It had no mutton but only a large chunk of fat. The paneer pulav was tasteless. Chicken biriyani was so so. Overall it was a worst experience. They deserve negative rating.

Pathetic experience. No value for customer's time. Ordered a soup and noodles, waited for over an hour to hear they have started preparing for my order.And that too they messed it up.It was 11pm at night and I had a long way to go. Atrocious food quality. Average decor. Awkward ambience. Staff members really did not care about me complaining about their faults. But they kept on delaying. They could have told that there will be delay in preparing the food in the beginning but instead had to wait for such an awful lot of time to get introduced to faulty orders and tasteless food.

The food is great ... Especially the indian food section (apart from the malai korta that is so sweet that it tastes like navrantan Korma) is better than the chinese preparations... The soups are a must try. And the price is  cheap.. that is what makes it even more exciting. However the place is small. And clingy.. And the ambience isn't so attractive... The lighting is poor.. otherwise it's a great place to have a meal now and then.

my menu - 1 Chicken Biryani , 1 Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala (6 Pcs) , 2 Laccha Paratha & 1 Raita

first of all i want to say that i was bit skeptical while ordering from jadu kadai cause of ratings and reviews but thankfully it was good :D what most amazed me was the freshness & hotness of the food i mean the food was delivered piping hot :O credit goes to swiggy! ok lets start the reviews!

Chicken Biryani - good! not at spicy , very light & flavored! just the chicken was chewy :/
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala (6 Pcs) - good! the gravy was awesome! but again chickens were chewy :/
Laccha Paratha - very different from the regular ones! its more of tandoori roti type but i must tell you it tasted soft & awesome! it was soft even on the next day! :D
Raita - good!

cons - the price!

overall i would rate jadu kadai 3.5 out of 5! :)))))

PS thanks swiggy for the 15% discount :))))))))))))))))

Small restaurant on first Floor at Behala Chourasta , just opposite to the Traffic Guard office lacks the JADU  to dazzle & delight the taste buds.
The main purpose of having desi  Chinese food in these types of restaurant is to substitute once's  hunger for junk food with a complete meal. When the Kadai fails to do so you feel disappointed.
Had Mixed Hakka Noodles -which was just ordinary to taste, even the scrambled egg in it was slightly perched. Hong Kong chicken- tasted a little like Manchurian and the batter fried chicken were small and herd to cut as "pakora " batter was used.
Service was fast and satisfactory and the over all ambiance of the place was clean and airy with air-conditioning. Pocket pinch for two with Masala- Cold drink was Rs 440/- with out any extra tax.

First I asked about Biriyani but they told its going to take time to serve it so we ordered Lancha Paratha and Chicken Kasha which we shared among each other. Both the dish were amazing. Second time also when I went during Durga Puja and asked about Biriyani they gave some other reason.

It's a mediocre restaurant. No such ambience. Food quality is average. Sometime they make the noodles salty other times they give too much chillies in the side dish which is supposed be medium spicy.
Price is average as well. I visit here when m damn hungry and need a cool shade for lunch. Being air conditioned it sometimes saves my day.
Recommended: don't try Chinese. Try tandoor dishes.

Without being biased by the reviews over here, went to this place to have a taste of their food. It was average. I liked their Chinese fried rice but other dishes were just average. Quantity is good considering the price. Coolest thing they had their vat included in the price when we had gone there. Recently found out that they do not serve food at odd times like 3:30 - 4:00 pm. Please mention it in your timings in zomato at least. This was disappointing. 
They charge more than usual for their normal coffee. waste of money.

I must say it's an underated restaurant.. When one of my frnd recommended me ds restaurant .. I immediately went thru the reviews of this place.. They were a bit disappointing.. I myself refused to have dinner there. But to my utter surprise ... It was a bomb( considering the bad reviews and price)!!.. 
  We ordered butter naan along with chicken tikka butter masala and chicken bharta... All the items wre of very good taste..I didn't try out there Chinese cuisine so I cannot cmnt on that.. The spce is a big constraint fr this restaurant...

Overall good food within budget..

Jadu Kadai is one of my favorite restaurants, since it's close to my place. The ambience, seating arrangements, service and food is quite good. We ordered hot garlic chicken, chilli paneer and blue lagoon mocktail and they tasted yummy! Overall good without the pocket pinch!

Small restaurant on first Floor at Behala Chourasta , just opposite to the Traffic Guard office lacks the JADU  to dazzle & delight the taste buds.
The main purpose of having desi  Chinese food in these types of restaurant is to substitute once's  hunger for junk food with a complete meal. When the Kadai fails to do so you feel disappointed.
Had Mixed Hakka Noodles -which was just ordinary to taste, even the scrambled egg in it was slightly perched. Hong Kong chicken- tasted a little like Manchurian and the batter fried chicken were small and herd to cut as "pakora " batter was used.
Service was fast and satisfactory and the over all ambiance of the place was clean and airy with air-conditioning. Pocket pinch for two with Masala- Cold drink was Rs 440/- with out any extra tax.

Food is just normal. No"Jadu" (magic) atall. The only thing that is better than rest of the new resturants in Behala is its location. And they provide FREE home delivery. That it !

First time I went there for dinner with two of my friends and surprisingly we had to wait outside for around 10 mins to get a seat. Ambience is normal type. First I asked about Biriyani but they told its going to take time to serve it so we ordered Lancha Paratha and Chicken Kasha which we shared among each other. Both the dish were amazing. Second time also when I went during Durga Puja and asked about Biriyani they gave some other reason.

It's a mediocre restaurant. No such ambience. Food quality is average. Sometime they make the noodles salty other times they give too much chillies in the side dish which is supposed be medium spicy.
Price is average as well. I visit here when m damn hungry and need a cool shade for lunch. Being air conditioned it sometimes saves my day.
Recommended: don't try Chinese. Try tandoor dishes.

Without being biased by the reviews over here, went to this place to have a taste of their food. It was average. I liked their Chinese fried rice but other dishes were just average. Quantity is good considering the price. Coolest thing they had their vat included in the price when we had gone there. Recently found out that they do not serve food at odd times like 3:30 - 4:00 pm. Please mention it in your timings in zomato at least. This was disappointing. 
They charge more than usual for their normal coffee. waste of money.

This is a budget hotel but you will never be dissapointed with food, service or expense. May I suggest you to go for chinese or thai cuisines.Their mughali cuisines are really ordinary.Tandoori is too small in size.Biriyani is really bad.Tandoori roti with chicken gravy is quit good.Chinese is their forte. American choupsey is quit tasty served with an egg poach.Fried rice is average, noodles is ordinary.Red garlic pepper chicken or dry chilli chicken as starters is excellent. Schezwan prawn n chicken manchurian is tasty.They hv two waiters working extensively to make u comfortable. That buys time but they are really polite.And expense is very reasonable.Little small in space but clean.

This is a restaurant that offers multi-cuisine at really cheap rates and is a favourite haunt of people from behala to thakurpukur.. The service and ambience is also great with soft music playing and the manager is particularly friendly. It can easily accomodate couples and even larger groups of 4-6..I would recommend their killer malai kofta!

Firstly a big no for any one who's planning to visit this place. Apart from poorly decorated and having a single staff who cleans dishes as well as serves food they serve the aweful food that would just go waste. I and my partner went there one fine afternoon for lunch as we thought let's try out this place( it was my idea as she constantly insisted me to go to Hatari). We ordered soup along with chicken rice and garlic chicken. The food they served was not enough hot and it tasted bland. We had the soup but the rice and chicken went into complete waste. So please think twice before visiting the place.

I have only been to Jadu Kadai once and I wouldn’t plan and go back again.

We were just about as hungry for snacks and soup so we walked in and took a seat. There is  no décor but they do try to create an ambience using lights. There is a huge flat screen TV at the end wall of the place on which was playing an IPL match during my visit. 

So first we ordered a chicken sweet corn soup which was very average and a little too sweet for me, although my partner thought it was fine. 

Next, he ordered a dry chilli fish, while I went for kebabs just to get an idea about their tandoor. The sauce of the fish was okay, but I felt the quality of the fish being used was a little substandard. The real deal breaker was the Chicken Tikka kabab I ordered. The six pieces were chewy and did not seem like they had been anywhere near a tandoor. Plus they were a little too artificially red in color. 

I will only give an extra point to the staff there, which was polite and well behaved. 

Food : 1.5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambience: 2/5

Value for Money: 2.5/5

Ok, writing about Jadu Kadai makes me a bit happy as i was one of the first day customer of their eating house. Me and my girl friend being foodies and being even localite of that place visit it like whenever we feel like. 

Coming to the food lets start with its Chinese section. The Chinese foods are absolutely at its best. Good amount as well as good quality.

The tandoor section or the biriyani section was not that a huge hit to me.

Good ambience, polite staffs and very very pocket friendly.

Over all a good choise

Please do eat here if you have a sweet tooth which decides not to leave you even when you are eating non-veg. Everything starting from the peas pulao to chicken reshmi blah blah was not just sweet, but sweeter than a rosogolla. Quality of food if you leave aside the sweetness was little below average, say 2/5. Overall.. a no no.

I really loved mutton punjabi. I deducted 1 from their rating because they were really running late for delivering the order and also for not able deliver biriyani, orelse the overall service along the food was very good.

Can't express my delight to see this place on Zomato...it is absolutely in front of my place and I have been eating here almost every Friday since 2010 when they first opened it. It's not at all pricey yet the food here is decent.. Though I never needed a parking space because I always walk there but you will almost always find a place to park your car. The service is good...very polite not exactly fast but they will not make you wait for eternity either.
Lastly if you are going on a weekend and around 8-10pm I will suggest you better get your seat reserved. :)

the food is average. have tried quiet a few times. won't recommend if are looking to try something special. but if you are looking for regular dishes you may have a go.

This restaurant is surely one of the well decorated restaurants in Behala! Though there's a lack of space! But the satff over there are very well mannered! Food is also good and price reasonable! USP of the place is its ambience!

I am rating jadu kadai a 2 STAR simply because they have a nice, quite ambience and the staff are well mannered. Food wise I would rate them 1 STAR because its most pathetic.

I had gone to this place which is 10 minutes from my home expecting nothing, to be very honest. As i entered i was happy to see the place very clean, there were two boys well dressed and well mannered, serving my family and me. the food was fresh, piping hot and yummy. THe staff took every care that my family and me had a nice quiet lunch. Prices for the meals were not overpriced and all i would say is that JADOO KADAI you have made me one happy customer and i would come back to your outlet at BEHALA CHOWRASTA once again :) Best of luck
