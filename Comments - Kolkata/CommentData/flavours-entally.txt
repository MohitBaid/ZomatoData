When this place newly opened, I had parcelled two plates of steamed chicken momo. The size of the momos were very small. To add to that, they tasted awful. Never ordered from this place since that day.

Near to st Teresa  church  reasonable price but the quality and even the taste of the food is not that good. I took chicken chow and roll .inside stuffing was good but the bread as in the paratha was horrible. The chowmin tasted like half burnt.

রাস্তার ধারে ছোট একটি দোকান মুলত বারিতে খাবার নিয়ে যাবার ক্ষেত্রে ব্যাবহার হয় । কম দাম ভালো খাবার দিয়ে পেট ভরাতে আসা যেতেই পারে । চিকেন রোল বেশ লেগেছে ।

A small streetside take away joint for quickbites located at Entally.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chicken roll, which was pretty nice with juicy stuffings inside and crispy paratha.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

A nice place for roll lovers.

Flavours is a small eatery located at Entally.

It mainly sells fast foods at an affordable price.

Service is quick.

Tried Egg Chicken roll, which to my surprise had nice stuffings and was tasty . The paratha was large and crispy.

Flavors is a small snacks outlet on S N Bannerjee Road. I had a Chicken Roll at this outlet. The roll was quite good, good paratha and big pieces of chicken stuffed inside.
I have also ordered their Fried rice from Swiggi and it was good.
Prices are also reasonable as per the quality.

I went with my best friend here. It is a very quiet place. Only both of us were there. The staff helped us in getting comfy. We ordered Paneer roll, and to our surprise, it was excellent. The filling was so good. Worth a visit!
