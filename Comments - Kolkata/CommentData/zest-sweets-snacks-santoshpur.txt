Located just at the heart of santoshpur 3rd road bus stop. Have been visiting this sweetmeat joint since past 20 plus years eyewitnessing their improvisation of food standard. It might not list among the top sweet shops of the city but certainly is a well known landmarked sweet shop of santoshpur. Sweets are fresh and good, especially their gurer rasogolla as per me can any day compete any renowned sweet shop of the city. Quality sweets are sold here in relatively less price. Shingara here also tastes good. Overall a thumbs up. Keep evolving !

I've tried only one of their sweets which was brought to our house as a gift. But simply loved that sandesh which was covered in jaggery. Really would like to try some more of their sweets.

I've been coming here for the past 15 years or more. Along with the storefront and facade, the intrinsic vibe of the place too has changed beyond recognition over this period. Staying in Delhi for the past 2 years, I came back to the neighborhood where my cousins live to find a much cleaner and brighter Zest than before.

However, the mishtis have not changed. While branding all of their offerings as average would be a crime to the Kalakand and Shankho Sandesh, most other items on the menu continue to be a step away from excellent. However, that does not mean you abandon your local mishtir dokan. I however, have fond memories of Kochuri-Alurdom from here on innumerable sundays and summer vacations, owing to the full layers of dal inside the luchis and the sweet and thick gravy of the alu. Hope that has stayed the same.

Saw that PRICES have not spun out of control, as have been the case in many mishti establishments and the range f mishti has increased. One thing is certain, Zest serves a large area in its immediate vicinity, which has precious other similar options. So, you might just land up here. 

Chakraborty Tip : Older patrons will remember the slightly mad yet perennially smiling 'Joga'. Did not see him this time.

This place is located on the main road and is very easy to locate. It is an average daily kinda sweatshop and the sweets are pretty good compared to its establishment infrastructure. The sandesh and kachagollas, I have tried during the winter and it was pretty good.

I saw this shop open during my school days and is a part of my growing up years. Every time. I am visiting my family in Kolkata, walking past Zest is a moment of nostalgia. Their shingara is a must have on every visit and one of the best in the area. The sweets are okay. It is about 100 metres from the main road into Third Road Bus Stop. If you are visiting someone and need that box of sweets; just walk to Zest and you will not be disappointed

Its one of the oldest sweet shop in our locality i.e. near third road where once snacks (from roll to biriyani) everything was available...its an all time favourite place to have mouth watering rasomalai and gulab jamun..the other sweets are also comparatively good and price are relatively less. For evening menu u can try their samosa and dhokla..U can also dig in to some dal and kachori on a Sunday morning as well...

It is one of the oldest sweet shops in Santoshpur. I've been going to this place ever since I could walk. Their daal puri is just awesome. They serve you hot and fresh. For some reason, it isn't available daily these days. The sweets are good but now that Santoshpur has more sweet shops in the vicinity, this place faces stiff competition. If you want okay tasting sweets in a low price range, go for this place.

It's one of the oldest sweet shops in Santoshpur. And for a certain period of time it was the only one near third road and vicinity. The Kachori and Aloor Dum is probably the best. Rasogollas have a taste of semolina ( if you get my drift). You may give it a try if you are really hungry and unable to move an inch from third road.

Great for snacks - their kochori and singara are all time favorites with my family - we order these from Zest only when we are in Kolkata. 
Sweets are also good and very reasonably priced.
