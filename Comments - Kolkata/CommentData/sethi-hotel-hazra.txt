A food joint located at Hazra, mainly serves North Indian & Chinese food at a cheap price.

Ambience is shabby with sitting arrangements.

Service is good.

Ordered Rumali roti & Chicken Bharta, food was tasty with sufficient quantity.

হাজরার তন্দুরি দারবার এর ঠিক বিপরীতে । কম দামে বসে খেয়ে পেট ভরানোর জন্য আদর্শ স্থান । তারকা রুটি খেয়েছিলাম স্বাদে বা মানে আহামরি নয় তবে দাম এর দিক দিয়ে দেখতে গেলে মন্দ নয় । কাজ চালানোর জন্য আসা যেতেই পারে ।

A popular eatery located at Hazra Road, this place mostly serves Punjabi style food. Do not go by the ambiance here, because people mostly drops by here for the flavorful and tasty food. The Bharta here was simply mindblowing. The pricing too is quite cheap and won't hurt your pocket.

The restaurant positioned on Hazra road is one of those old gems. Its famous for its punjabi food, but dont let the other items be fooled.

Ambiance - Horrible (Wish Ramsey would come down some time and make an episode on hotel hell here)
Food - Extremely delightful 
Price - Very convenient (On the lower side)
Attitude - Very humble people 

Also, the chicken rolls here are mouth watering. Clearly the chicken in fresh and not frozen. A complete value for money!

During late night eats, I went to sethi hotel at Hazara Road. Ambience was not Good . Very prompt and courteous service. Most important, it is food for which I with my visited to this Hotel. Food was excellent. I ordered chicken butter masala (medium size) for myself and in main course I ordered chicken tarka. Chicken butter masala was very delicious.

I have given the rating of 4.5 only for the excellent food at Sethi Hotel !! Even though the ambience is not so good to have a peaceful lunch or dinner, the taste is awesome.. I would suggest you to take away parcels.. 
Roti, tadka and chole are THE BEST around that area.. total punjabi style!! Very affordable and cheap for students who pass by and unmarried people living around this prime busy area.. Ever since I left Kolkata, I have never tasted anything so good yet so cheap anywhere!!! Waiting to come back soon..

Sethi hotel is to Hazra what the Bachan dhaba is to Rashbehari.

Several decades old,alas the Sethi hotel proprietors did not visualise a Zomato someday,and even if they did,rally did not care.

This is no fine dining place,nor even a dhaba.This is an eatery just between your roadside machh/bhat ( fish/rice ) places popular amongst kali peeli cab drivers and the more decent pice hotels so typical of Calcutta.

My staple is the alu mutter and chicken curry.Not kosha as that has a lot of reused oil.Also at rs. 480/- a kg it's unwise to order mutton dishes here or in a dhaba as well as at their prices the arithmetic simply does not match up.

Hygiene is an issue now as I saw today and won't be surprised if this place metamorphoses into a KFC or Subway soon considering the prime location.

Sad!

This is a place I have visited since my childhood. May not be very decorated one but the quality of food is not bad. We often order rumali roti, egg tadka and chana masala, and the items are well prepared. The rates are very reasonable.

Normal dinner or lunch for people living in PG, hostel or just passing by. Serves tandoori, Indian chicken dishes with roti. Also serves snacks like fish fry, fish finger, Mughlai paratha. This is for eating meals regularly for those who doesn't cook at home.

This place is nearest from Hazra crossing. A chaotic unhygienic  place with poor service. The Chinese dishes are not up to the mark. Only the rice thali is comparatively good than the other items.

Location: A few meters from Hazra Crossing (towards Kalighat Fire Station)

Sethi Hotel has been here for years now serving the people of Kolkata with dhaba-style North Indian fare. Having read rave reviews about its quality, dropped by to check out. But, sorry to say, the scenario wasn't as great as depicted.

The AMBIANCE is vapid with an inclination towards the shabby and shady end.
Non-air conditioned seating, dirty fans, dull walls, smelly environment. A sad state altogether.
About the FOOD, had opted for the North Indian Fare out of the two available (Chinese & North Indian). The following was ordered:

- Dal Tadka
Black lentils simmered overnight and well-seasoned. The Dhaba-style preparation was quite nice and one of the nearly good ones under the Dhaba-style category. Recommended.

- Rumali Roti
Was a disappointment as it felt rubbery in nature. Have had much better ones.

- Tandoori Roti
The irregular shaped  (after being here for years; weird) roti was decent to have but, lacked the crispness as asked for. Disappointed.

- Butter Naan
Almost nicely baked naan served with a generous brush of butter. Was just about average in taste, could have been much better had it been perfectly tandoor-baked.

• Complimentary green chillies, a lemon wedge & diced onions were served along with the order.

The friendly STAFF were lackadaisical which affected the service speed (was towards the moderate).
PRICES were pocket friendly, but, somewhat a pinch was felt thanks to the quality.

Overall a bad experience.
- Needs urgent hygiene uplift and a serious quality check. If not worked upon soon, customers wouldn't mind traveling to another Dhaba-style joint barely 50 meters from here.

This is one of the places where you just can't expect or ask for a fine ambiance or shiny cutlery. It is a non-airconditioned, slightly chaotic dhaba located at almost opposite of restaurant Tandoori Darbar, which serves inexpensive yet tasty food. The service is reasonably quick though a little more cleanliness would be appreciated.

Sethi and Novelty are twin Dhabas at the Hazra Road junction. at a time when the Old Punjabi Dhaba tradition is fast fading with old Dhabas upgrading themselves and opening franchisee chains - Sethi and Novelty still keeps the old joys of sinful slumming going. Both have suitably crummy ambience (Novelty a bit more - Sethi now also boasts of an AC Section) but the food - always freshly prepared. The saag meat is my favourite along with the Mutton Kassa (Kosha). Supplement it with an Anda (Egg)  Dal Tadka if you have company or feeling ravenously hungry.

This place is excellent for takeaways and it often stays open even after its scheduled time at night.The food here is superb and at extremely cheap prices.The SPECIAL EGG TADKA deserves extra special mention.It is soo delicious and yummy, its easily the best made Tadka in town and that too at such price.Have it with their Tandoori roti and bite into a juicy piece of onion for an out of this world gastronomic experience experience.The other items that I have tried here are - Chicken Bharta,Dahi Tadka,Chicken Butter Masala,Paneer Butter Masala and Veg.Tadka Double Fry and excepting the Chicken Butter Masala , all of them were really good!!Vegetarians can go for their Dahi Tadka or Double fry Tadka too or any other vegetarian fare all of which are mouth watering.
However this place is mostly frequented by college students(mostly boys) ,office workers and cab drivers but is that not how an actual Dhaba should be ..and I did say  takeaway is the best option.But the food is really good and it seems to be prepared and served with so much care,the place is clean.And the people who serve are always very attentive and friendly.Sometimes I don't mind sitting at the table and having my favourite food here,just for a change.

Did not expect that I will find Sethi listed on Zomato ! I have been having food from here since my childhood as it is situated at walking distance from my place
It is a very basic eatery mainly serving Indian cuisine. Situated near the Hazra Junction, the ambiance is very very shabby with basic seating and few tables which can accommodate 20-25 people. 
It is mainly a take away joint and serves food at dirt cheap prices. The tandori roti is one of my favourites out here. Chicken Bharta, chicken reshmi butter masala and Spl egg tadka is worth mentioning. At least totally worth the price. 

Serving time is very quick. Cost for two is Rs 250. 
I usually do a take away when mom is not cooking at home :P.
