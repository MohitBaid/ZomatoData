The picture below was taken at around 4:30 am in the morning. And the picture says it all. As the delivery person said,  "Kolkata k kisi bhi kona pe kabhi bhi khana chahiye,  sharma dhaba yaad karna". They are not bluffing it one bit. A group of 5 guys are hungry as in a drought at around 3:30 in the night. From where did this intense late night hunger come from? Let's leave that to the imagination of the smarter ones here. We looked up zomato and swiggy to find that none of the places serve food at 4 am in the night,  expectedly. Then we looked up all night food delivery to find this dhaba on justdial, of all places. We called up,  with little hope(note that this place is in Ballygunge area and we were calling from baranagar). To our surprise,  the dhaba took the order for 5 mutton biriyanis,  a full chicken tandoori and 2 plates of chicken kebab. We finished ordering at 3:50 am. The food ordered at 4:20 am. How this was possible is still a mystery to us ,considering the distance. This place is the messiah of late night food cravings. You saved us, Thank you!!

Their list of the fat free rolls are absolutely to die for! The rolls are wrapped in a romali roti, which is super thin and light and one could have two easily!

The accompanying chatni just adds to the flavour

My rating of "5" is based purely on the outstanding Chicken Bharta that is served at this Dhaba, and the fact that this place has been in existence for over 80 years.. I think that speaks volumes for the quality and taste of the food served here. Chicken Bharta with Roomali Roti is a MUST HAVE at this place.. especially for people visiting Kolkata.. I can guarantee this is not available in your city. The Egg Bharta is also worth a try.

Daal came without salt, literally no salt and when msg was given through zamato restaurant said NO, we did put salt.
 That means either customer is mad or he is a lier. The quality of roti is close to papad. The only God thing was they gave Onion and lemon with it. And no change money was given to delivery boy, they knew that was a COD ???? If I could give zero as rating I would me more than happy.

I've been to this place quite a number of times along with my friends.Staff here is courteous and are super friendly too. Interiors are not that good which take a hot onto this restaurant's ambience.They also deliver food at your doorstep as late as around 2am and promise to deliver it within 15mins of time. I ordered the Kashmiri Aloo Dum and the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and both were delicious. Quality of food was exceptionally well too.They served us our portions pretty fast.Though they serve Chinese too but I'd recommend you all to have Indian dishes on your visit.

A fairly famous outlet in this area. Mainly people park their cars by the side of this restaurant and enjoy evening snacks and tea. Hugely popular for good food and quick service. Well you can't complaint much about the shabby interiors and loud ambience. Seating arrangements are pretty decent and staff are okayish. Food tastes fresh and nice. Price are very reasonable. Perfect spot for college students.

Sharma’s Dhaba, in spite of being famous for their North Indian cuisine we preferred having Chinese. Had ordered for Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Jeera rice. The Chinese food was a proper Indianized version of the cuisine.  The Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles were spicy and rich, while the Jeera Rice was prepared in its normal way. Even though it was a detour from the actual cuisine, we still relished our meal. Quantity was good and the service was prompt.

Personally I didn't liked the food that much. It is good if you are hungry but don't expect anything special.

I ordered :-
*CHICKEN BHARTA : It is their most famous item .but I didn't find anything special (3/5)
*GARLIC NAAN (3/5)
*TANDOORI ROTI (3/5)
*DAL MAKHANI (2.5/5)
*PALAK PANEER (2/5)
*CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB (3/5)
*PALAK PANEER (2/5)
*ONION SALAD (2/5)
*PAPAD (ROASTED) (4/5)

All the food above was average. Nothing special.

Heard about this place a lot, and one of the place in Kolkata that remains open till late. So we did give it a try during durga Puja. 

I would describe my experience as "a place for wicked, cheap and criminal minded a**holes"
I've gone there with two female friends of mine, the place was little crowded, but managed to get a table in 20 mins. 

Two groups of guys came in, sat just next table to us and ruined our peaceful meal idea, passing comments, staring unashamed, and the officials just kept watching the fun 
I swear if that have been in Mumbai or any other city, they would've left the place with broken vital body parts. 

Anyways we've ordered for Chicken bharta (which was my fav), chicken fried rice, dal makhni. Would say the food is good, but dear if you want to run a resto where you would like good people to come in as well, make sure you have this security thing sorted. 

Very much disappointed.

Thumbs up - if u looking to have kebabs and some great north Indian food then this is the place for u. The chicken kebabs are just mouth watering.
Must try - for NVeg : tandoori chicken, Reshmi kebab, butter chicken, name and kebab rolls they are just mmmmmmmmmm :-) :-D
For Veg : mushroom kebab paneer tikka and kebab rolls.

This place is heaven for kebabs. I just love it.

Thumbs down - place is usually congested as its on a busy road. They have opened one Ac seating room but it's very small. So most of the times u have to have it in open. Make sure u taking ur car when visiting the place.

Honestly I do visit this place regularly for its kebab and also its a good hangout place with friends for Chai and sutt :-P.

I had heard so much about this place. And it turned out to be absolutely disappointing. Agreed that one shouldn't expect a five star ambience from a dhaba but at least some sort of hygiene and cleanliness should be maintained. The service was fast and the place is open 24x7 and I guess those are the only two positives I can point out. The food was terrible. The chicken pieces were hard. The butter masala gravy was yellow for some weird reason. The paneer pieces were like small pieces of rocks. The garlic naan had hair on it. There are definitely better budget restaurants in kolkata serving clean and tasty food that remain open almost all night. I see no special reason for visiting this place ever again.

So , this dhaba happens to be just few steps away from my pg . Let me tell you this is the best place to eat if you all are looking for night outs. Prompt service and delicious food is what makes it unique. Last day we tried garlic naan (which was awesome af) chicken kasha , fried rice and then some random sweets. The food as usual was delicious , service was good . It lacks in its ambience a bit but all in all it was a pleasant experience and a must visit place too.

Chicken tandoori was well smoked and yet soft and juicy. Dahi mutton was well cooked too. It is open all night. Parking on the road.

Daily adda joint for teenagers. 
The staffs are very prompt and fast with orders. Service to car is readily available. You will get the dhaba feel once you order the special chai in a earthen cup. The samosa n kachori are delicious. Its a everyday snack if you are not on a diet regime. 
Coming to the dinner menu they have plenty of options. North indian dishes as well as some chinese dishes. Have tried out their chicken rolls which are great, unlike other food joints their rolls are not made of thick parantha which only fills the stomach along with way too much oil. The rolls here are slimmer and less oily with good amount of chicken. Chicken tandoori gets a apecial mention. Dry, spicy, well cooked, smoky chicken along with great mint chutney. Dont miss out. 
The naan and chicken gravy dishes are also good.

Right opposite to the gate of ballygaunge maidan camp. A two storied restaurant with non ac Ground floor and ac 1st floor. Well behaved staff and sober ambience even in the mid night. It has been a constant place for us in the midnight whenever hunger strikes. Chicken tandoori, butter nun or butter tandoori and chicken bharta are our constant orders. The quality and quantity of the food are extremely good according to the price. They provide best bharta in the town. Even at 3am or 4am their service is real quick. One of my favourite place for dinner.

Items that i love here are 
1- chicken bharta (probably the best in town)
2-Mutton keema 
3- chicken tikka butter masala . 
 Almost every item that I've tried here is good . And the best part is they even deliver at midnight when you dont have any options left .

And today after eaten mutton Biryani I am suffering from loose motion. 
So I suggest you guys plz don't think to visit in this place, as we had a bad experienced here.

I've been going to this dhaba since ages. High school and college memories would not be the same without the mention of this place. From hanging out for chai, to eating in/on the boot of the car, from meeting up with friends to gorging after partying all night, this place was fantastic. Chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta, double anda tarka, butter naan and salad is pretty much our standard order. Mumbai may have all the fancy places but Sharma made my cousin from Mumbai jealous of Kolkata... What more can I say..

Sharma dhaba is very punctual in delivery and acceptance is prompt. Their egg biryani and shahi paneer were both very sumptuous. The egg biryani wasn't much oily, and the paneer had nice tangy gravy. The aloo egg roll and paneer roll, both costs 50 bucks and are disappointing. One can expect better proportions and filling at this rate.

The kebab where big in pieces and where delicious but the chutney seemed little wierd in colour and tastes different.

It's good to go back to the old days where we used to visit sharma dhaba where we used to have limited budget to spend after a weekend party. After 13 year I visited sharma today I was so amazed with the changes and improvements. The chicken bharta wasn't taking the same but the egg tadka was the same the chicken tikka was ok the roti is to die for.

Having lived the past two decades in Delhi/ NCR  , i was bound to fall in love with dhabas . while in Kolkatta street was was my favourite . Last week tried Jai Hind , this week , Sharma Dhaba . Both i believe are popular options in Kolkatta , I ordered the same food at both places , I found the dal makkini better at Sharmas and even the roties were softer . Lachha paratha i had at both places , 
The best way to rate a dhaba is just on dal roti .. that is the concept of dhaba . All other things are extras . Since i had the food packed for home from sharmas i cannot comment on the service , Packing was good and food hot enough when i put it on my plate . So I am happy ,
Still Delhi and Gurgaon dhabas i will misss till i get back .

A Kebab lover's paradise and a gastronomic extravaganza!! Really satisfied with the way they have worked upon the food and service at this Dhaba. Been an old customer. Mostly went for the chai and amazing lassi. Recently went for a full course meal at the restaurant upstairs. A shabby looking place on the outside, one wouldn't really be able to predict that they have quite a neat and tidy seating arrangement. Great food at reasonable prices is what you would get out here. Tried out the Leg Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The Reshmi Butter Masala was a little too salty but the waiter was really nice and polite and got it changed. The chicken was fresh, soft,perfectly cooked and the kebab was tantalising on a cold winter night! Loved the experience!

This place is lined with cars all day as it's better known for car service than sitting inside the dhaba. My brother visits this place often with his friends. I accompanied him one day to taste the yummy food he boasts of.

We ordered
Aloo Do piyaza
Mix Veg
Dal Tarka

Rumali Roti
Aloo parantha.

The food was definitely yummy but just extremely oily for my taste. The aloo parantha is a meal in itself. But if something was really good it was the aloo do piyaza. 

The food was good to taste but definitely not healthy. So I would not visit anytime soon. And please check order quantity we were three people but we ended up wasting quite a bit. Portion size is good.

Location: In ballygunge, right opposite of ballygunge maidan camp. Its just right ahead of azad hind dhaba

Interior designing: just a regular dhaba looks inside, it is divided into two sections. The down area has non AC and the up area has AC. 

I have been to this place a lot with my friends. They used to serve till night but now they stopped. Tea time is till 7pm. The servers are really nice and they will tend to your every needs. For students like us, it is the best adda place to chill and to eat. This dhaba is a saviour for those people who parties at night and this is the only place to tend to your late night hunger.

Food: i dont even know, i ate a lot of food from here. The tea here is the best out of all the dhabas. I really loved it.

We went to Sharma Dhaba today for our lunch after reading the mind blowing reviews, honestly it wasnt as good as we expected it to be. 
Mutton keema was like a normal one which you prepare at home, no essence of being a dhaba item. No thickness, no cream, no butter. 
Tandoori rotis were more of normal rotis.
An average place according to us. 
The service was poor.

Went there after the late night movie with family found the same waiters who do remember people 
Ordered for dal makhani panner butter masala and nan they had stopped serving tea which was one of the star during night 
Found lots of cars stopping by and the place was crowded 
Food was good and the quantity was also good 
And the price was also ok 

Overall a good experience

Sharma Dhaba is a hotspot for all foodies from around ballygunge, many flock here for evening tea and snacks and some do for a meal as well. 

I honestly don't prefer eating here as I find the food too spicy for my taste as a whole. But a lot of my friends who can handle spice prefer it over other similar food joints or "Dhabas" 

Well, to each his own, service is pretty fast and the tea is good too!

Well this place is a godsent, even though the food is mediocre at best even in comparison with it's closest competitor jai hind dhaba in Sarat Bose Road, the USP of this place is that it delivers all night lo g where others stop at 3o clock, be it 4 6 or even 8:30 during breakfast. For a night owl in their delivery area its a godsent. Please mention less salt to them or you won't be able to eat the food. Cheers.

Now this is what you call 'good things come in small packages'.
We had visited this place in the wee hours of the night. I was not expecting much considering the hours. But man! My expectations were shattered. As we reached the place,a man quickly came and took our order. It did not take him long to serve us the food. We had ordered for chicken tikka fat free roll,masala kulcha,egg bhurjee,chicken bharta,masala soda and soda shikanjee. I have been in love with masala kulcha ever since. Thick,buttery and full of taste. The roll was something unique. Unlike the usual parantha rolls,it was made with rumali roti. The stuffing inside was way too filling. Big fat chuncks of meat bursting with flavours. A MUST MUST try! 
The pricing is very reasonable and would not pinch your pocket much. 
P.s- as i was so hungry,i started hogging as soon as the food arrived.. so no pictures could be taken.

While doing a pandel hopping for the entire night, went to Sharma's  as we were out of option at around 4 am.
Best thing about this restuarant was it's open 24 hours and never felt it was 4 am when we had our food. It was crowded like anything and the 2 nd best thing about it was it's dhaba style food on the car bownet. loved it.
Now the food was not that good,same gravy in everything and late service. Preference is given to priority customers.
We Odered butter panner,chicken bharta and tikka butter masala and butter Naan.
The gravy was same and they did not take card ,maybe to indulge in getting tips.
So overall average experience but as it's open 24 hours a 4 thumps up.

Before setting out for pandal hopping we decided to have breakfast at sharma dhaba. I have heard that their tea is very famous and tried it out. And it was actually really good. It had full fat milk and was well balanced in sweetness. It even had the earthy flavour from the clay pot in which it was served. 
For the food we had puri aloo, naan and chola masala. The puri were made of dal and were thick and tasty. The aloo sabji had gram in it and also tasted good. It was not very spicy and had less of masala in it. These two things were served with chilli pickle which I liked very much and raita which was not that good. 
We then had garlic naan, paneer tikka and chola masala. The garlic naan had lots of butter dripping from it and was studded with pieces of garlic; they were too tasty to accompany it with a curry or dal. The paneer tikka had a thick layer of masala on it which only meant that it had been marinated long enough to get that flavour. With that they gave us a very generous amount of sliced onions, lemon halves and chutney. The chutney was minty and sweet. The chola masala was cooked in the typical cashew nut paste, something that I had not come across with respect to cooking with chhole. And it tasted really good. The gravy was thick, full of spices and uplifted the entire dish. We even had jalebi but it had gone soggy because of staying out for too long. So I would not recommend it. 
Sharma dhaba is a very common place for student hangouts, late night eats and tea spots as it is open 24 hours. The food really is another level of dhaba food. It will just not disappoint you.

The last Saturday, was our (me and my partner in crime, the wife's) dhaba look out day. Our aim was to drive to the so called Dhabas of Kolkata, close to our area of travel, get in and have some hassle free yummy food.
So to put this plan in effect, we went to ballygaunge area. Opposite, the army cantonment area, this dhaba is situated.
I've been traveling to this place since ages. How did I miss this dhaba, is something which makes no sense to me at all!
We went in and got seated. The entrance of this place is small, easy to miss, but they have a fair enough space inside including the AC section.
We chose to seat outside to have the feel of the Dhaba and those college courtship days, when we would go out on a date and barely afford these places!
The aroma of this place is enough to make you hungry. The smell of spicy food, burnt meat in the tandoor, loud noises of people talking, actually was the ambience we were searching for.
We ordered a plate of chicken seekh kebab and a plate of mutton Boti kebab and we were served in no time.
6, pieces of chicken seekh kebab, warm, served with an extra green chtuney and onion rings, was the perfect way to start the evening. The pieces were soft and nicely spiced. However, I felt it was a bit dry.

Next up, was the mutton boti kebab. It was right of the tandoor, smoking hot, had the smell of charcoal in it. I thought, the smell was too strong, overbearing, marred the taste a bit. However, the botis were tender as crazy. Accompanied by the green chutney, it just melted in our mouth. 
That was , our deal with the Sharmas, it was just the beginning of the evening and we thought to have the dinner(mains) from another dhaba.

To sum up, loved the ambience, the aroma, their service and definitely their food, would definitely come by in the middle of the night, during pujas.

The place serves quite nice dhaba food which is a tad bit oily, but full of flavour. I have tried the following dishes -

Chicken Masala - Just what you expect when you order such a dish! The desi flavour shines through and it's quite a treat! It looks less but once you start eating, the heaviness sets in.

Garlic Naan - OH MY GOD! The amount of garlic is unbelievable! Moreover the size is massive! I love garlic but this was definitely over the top. Obviously whatever I had with it had a well pronounced garlicky flavor!

thier Malai kebab masala is a must try!

Thanks to the Dhaba at Ballygunge Phari shutting down, my lunchtime craving for Dhaba food forced me to turn to the other dhabas in the vicinity... Settling upon Sharma Dhaba because I had heard good things about it, I had a very basic meal home-delivered - egg tarka and tandoori rotis..To my surprise the rotis were like leather and the tarka was swimming in reddish oil. The first bite had my mouth aflame instantly!! I had kept a bowl of curd at hand to go with my meal, but it did little to relieve me and my mouth...Don't think I'll order from here again in a hurry!

I have tried only tandoori chicken from this place few times which I ordered for home delivery via Swiggy.It comes in four big pieces of chicken which are soft,smoky and spicy.Tandoori chicken is really perfect.But the green sauce they give is just too much weirdly bright green.Seems like they use colouring substance to give it that colour.I would suggest to avoid that.. instead make it with the usual curd,mints,corriander and chilli to give it a milder green colour yet good refreshing taste.

This place is not about ambience, this is for any time food. In Kolkata there are very few places now-a-days which are 24 hours open and this is one of those ! A perfect place for late night or mid night or early morning food. Food quality is strictly OK, but love some of the items. One should try tandoori aloo here. Although I am a hard core nonvegetarian, I love this item in Sharma dhaba. Their tea is something I due for. A perfect den for kolkata party lovers !

The name sharma dhaba is enough for people to recall it's location. Been there many times. We ordered food both from the car and sat inside the restaurant itself too. There's nothing much to say about their ambience because the concept of ambience doesn't apply here. Starting from masala kulcha, Paneer kulcha, the famous chicken malai kebab, chicken tandoori butter masala, roomali rotis, naan, chicken tandoori, mutton roll....I think I have tried 80% of their menu. They will never disappoint in terms of quantity but sometimes quality was not as good. The same dish would taste differently on different occasions. And I think this is the biggest minus for me. Every time I ordered something I prayed to God so that they deliver that particular taste which I like. But as u can understand, sometimes God listened sometimes didn't.

I have been to this place before, never had such proper dinner, just had visits, positive side of this place is its location. Its a very paush location. Nd this dhaba is situated on the main road so its very easy to locate nd even convenient also. Staffs here are good,

Everytime i have been i always go for takeaway or i manage to eat outside somewhere, its very unhygienic n unclean to sit and have food there. What i like is tea they serve, food for me was always bad, last time i have placed an order from zomato n i had my dinner from sharma's. What more after pukish tendency i finished up vomiting, so for me it was always a horrible experience, its a good thing that its a 24*7 dhaba, late night 2 even if you are hungry returning from somewhere you can easily get a meal here, though not fit for me to eat

Late night parties at park street, dinner at Sharma Dhaba i dont really remember how many times i have done it. I really like the food, specially the chicken bharta, roomali roti, chana masala, keema matar i also like the kulfi with falooda, early or late evening tea in khullar is also fantastic

A special mention to Ramu in service who always take great care of me and my gang.

On a very spacial day We went there. On 15th of June 2016 to be precise. It was a hot day and after quite an adventure we finally found this place. 
I really didn't have a nice experience over here.  My lowest rating till date in Zomato.
Their ambience is average. 
But the food! My god! We decided this place the the overall ratings! I was most disappointed with the quality of the food!
I agree there service was fast! But the food quality was PATHETIC! 
We ordered #PaneerTikka, #KeemaNaan #CheeseNaan #ChickenDoPiyaja & #Tarka
Paneer tikka was average.
Both the naan's were burnt!! It was as hard as a rock. I find very little BUTTER in my Cheese Naan! 
Chicken do piyaja was too rich! And Tarka?
It was burnt as well! 
If you love LIGHT FOOD PLEASE DON'T COME HERE. 
All are highly Mashaladaar Khaana over here.

** I don't think I'd visit Sharma Dhaba again, until or unless I'm forced to! Or i have to!

Been here several times. And have tried many of their dishes. Not very fond of Sharma Dhaba. But after late night parties there will be definitely someone in the group who wants to eat at the sharma dhaba. The roti's are crisp and the black dal is nice.

The USP of this place is their location and their working hours. At hours, when you may not find anywhere else to go, be sure to come over here. Their service is fast and the food is quite average. I came here only once and took Chicken Bharta for take-away. Not too bad or not too good, the gravy was sumptuous and had sufficient quantity to fill up the tummy for two. Although, I have had better Chicken Bharta elsewhere, this could certainly be opted for in times of need. Would like to come back some day and try their Lassi, as I have heard good reviews about it.

Value for money .... All times of the day ! Being close to the house invariably means we end up there atleast once a week for a roll or just for an evening chai and samosa !

The menu is good, the waiters are efficient, and the service is quick ! Considering the hygiene as we are there so often... I have walked into their kitchen just to have a look. Nothing fancy but clean and well kept. 

The quality of food is consistent, value for money and the fact that it's open late only helps !

The negative if any is the parking that gets a little challenging at times !

The taste of the mutton boti kebabs still lingers in my tastebuds. Awesome it is. Their lassi is great and so their rotis. Gravy items are good too. Do try their kebab rolls. Very filling. It is better to do a take away or eat in you car if you do not want to dine in the cramped ambience. But the food is awesome here. Pricing is cheap.

One of those places in Kolkata which operates till late hours and to be honest can be a saviour for people like me who looks out for food at odd hours. The place is located besides Punjab Club. The seating area is shabby and kind of dirty. The service is fast though and its a good thing that you wont have to wait for your food like an eager hungry soul.

Now coming to their food. Everything is quite decent. I generally order their Egg Tadka and Chicken Bharta. Some of the items are stupidly priced though. A glass of soft drink costs 20 bucks but Masala Soft Drink is 60 bucks. A small amount of masala costs 40 bucks. Anyway a pretty ordinary place but due to dearth of options at night, you can try this place out.

Best place for budget celebration for city's Night owls to get rid of tiredness & when you're craving for north India food specially kabab's,There you go.... Right in front of Ballygunge camp in circular road.

SERVICE: 9/10
HYGIENE MAINTAINED: 7/10
TASTE:9/10
AMBIENCE: 8/10
VALUE FOR MONEY: 9/10
It's better to have your food out in open in your car or on d bonnet or maybe under the tree.
It's a gr8 value for money food junction.I found that they are less concerned when it comes to maintain hygiene.They still use old plastic Jugs & occasionally serve chilled water.
That's not a big deal, it's common in every Dhaba's.They are good in what they should be & that is the Taste & Quality of food.
Mutton reshmi kabab,Malai kabab & Seek kabab's are worth to give a try.
They also serve Fat Free Rolls.

On our way back from the disaster movie called Batman vs Superman around 1 am we stopped here for our dindin. It is a known fact that terrible movies increase your appetite many fold thus we opted out of the roti rolls and ordered the keema mutter, chicken bharta  and tandori rotis.  It was a pretty standard fare , nothing exceptional and azad hind definitely makes a better keema mutter and jai hinds bharta is unparalleled. Serving size is decent enough. The USP of this dhaba is definitely it's location, it being open till very late and prompt service. Turning the car bonnets into a table by shoving a jug of water underneath it a pretty impressive trick. .5 brownie points just for that

This is one place where we friends gather to have our dinner whenever we leave the disc or when we have a late night at the office. And the best part is whether you eat in your car or outside on the pavement under the tree or inside the restaurant the service is very good and fast. And the best item which I like the best is their chicken tikka masala and their dal fry or tarka. Not to say their other items are bad. In fact their food quality is very good and their Alu dopiyaaza is also very good.  I would keep going there and will also tell my friends to go there to have not just good food but also enjoy the ambience and the open air fun

It's like that robotic dhaba, where we people enter, do the eye contact with manager and bam the food is on the table. A total Punjab power to be precise. The food is finger licking great and tea for morning goers, gives the perfect kick. Though the place can go for  redecoration.

One of the dhaba that is open at night to night to folks who love the their mid night meals. Been here a few times and I liked the food here. I always have the roomali roti and paneer for my meals and sometimes black daal also. The only thing I do not like is the Makhana that they add to their daal, without them i would have said that it was one of the best daals that I have had.  A very good place, with good food....

Sharma Dhaba is the only joint known to me that is open 24 hours everyday. I stay at BMC so the place is literally 3-4 minutes walking distance.
The place serves quite nice dhaba food which is a tad bit oily, but full of flavour. I have tried the following dishes -
Chicken Masala - Just what you expect when you order such a dish! The desi flavour shines through and it's quite a treat! It looks less but once you start eating, the heaviness sets in.
Garlic Naan - OH MY GOD! The amount of garlic is unbelievable! Moreover the size is massive! I love garlic but this was definitely over the top. Obviously whatever I had with it had a well pronounced garlicky flavour!
Mutton Biryani - The only dish that was a bit disappointing. I don't mean it's not good, but it's quite far away from the Biryani you get at Shiraz or some other restaurant.
Chicken Tikka - This was a wonderful dish with perfectly cooked chicken. The chicken was perfectly charred on the outside and perfectly juicy inside.
Once while passing by, I also tried their Chicken Egg Roll and its was really really delicious! It was quite filling and definitely worth the price, speaking of which, the place is reasonably cheap and that makes it even more popular.
You must give this place a shot and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed!

If you are looking for the worst north india food in Kolkata...this is the perfect place for you...Sharma Dhaba is the most popular joint for alcoholics of this city...if you are too drunk to not care about the taste of food that you are going to eat late night...Sharma Dhaba is the place for you...But if you do care about the quality of the food that you are eating....trust me a road side dhaba selling a dal worth 10 rupees and a roti worth 1 rupee is better than this filthy place...nearby dhabas like JAI HIND DHABA and Azad HIND dhaba are 100 times a better option

This was an awesome find for me

After a tiring movie of 2.5 hours, we made our way to Ballygunje Maidan camp where you would find the quintessential Sharma Dhaba. It's like your typical Punjabi dhaba with all tadka and chicken. Good thing about this place is it is open till 2-3 am in the morning, so a haven for many of the city's night owls who can either come to this joint or order from the same. 

Since I had gone to the place with 2 more veterans, they did the honors regarding the ordering:
1. Murg Tikka Masala
2. Dotti Masala
3. Rumali Roti
4. Soda Shikanji
5. Cola Masala

Even though I was a little concerned with regards to the portions served, but the taste was amazing. Another thing I observed, may be I am wrong, they outsourced the drinks to a  shop nearby. These drinks were served in real matkas, remember the ones in the stations. 

The services was good and prompt and ready to help. The crowd was very diverse, with Audis and Autos, both parked in front and enjoying one or the other dish. 

This truly has been a find!

Located on Circular Road this looks like any normal roadside food joint, but it will just take a plate full of chicken bharta and mutton keema with tandoori rotis to change your perception. High chances you won't manage to get a table due to dearth of seating space and its actually great as that gives you one good excuse to enjoy your dinner inside your car or the tree nearby whichever suits you the best. And yea in case you have a sweet tooth do finish your meal with a bhand of Lassi......

We come to eat here whenever we go for drives. Tiny dhaba, opposite to ballygunj maidan camp. Cars line up in front of the dhaba and food is served on the bonnet. I'm a fan of the chicken bharta and rumali roti. The rolls are supposed to be really great. Specially chicken malai kabab roll. Gotta try them someday

I have been been to this place several times but never wrote a review. 
So, below are my observations of 2 back to back visits recently.

The below review is when I visited this place with a friend of mine and preferred to eat while seated in the car though we were told that they have come up a better seating arrangement upstairs. We ordered Aloo Tandoori, Mushroom Tikka and Chicken Tikka.

Aloo Tandoori-It had a stuffing and finished in the tandoor which gave a nice smoky flavour. 

Mushroom Tikka-It was soft and well done but was very salty which was a pretty big let down.

Chicken Tikka-Was extremely soft and melt in the mouth.

Each of the above had a nice mint and pudina chutney as well as a sufficient amount of salad. 

The staff who took are order was courteous and prompt. This place is good for delivery, take away or to enjoy the way I did (in the comfort of my car).

The total bill came of R 470/- which was very economical.
I rate this place 3.5 based on the above experience.

I went the following day with my family for food to be taken away.

We ordered Palak Cream, Mutton Dopiaza, Mutton Korma, Mutton Seekh Kebab Masala and Butter Roti(Fulka).

Palak Cream-Was excellent creamy and well seasoned.

Mutton Dopiaza-Was soft and melt in the mouth and had a great amount of fried brown onions.

Mutton Korma-Was a big let down as the mutton pieces were hard and lacked taste (had to recook it the following day since it was so hard)

Mutton Seekh Kebab Masala-Was a very strange dish which had chunks of rolled minced mutton which was not edible.

Butter Roti(Fulka)-Was nicely smeared with adequate butter and nothing to fault.

To begin with, I would say this is one of those places where you can bring all your "bukhe" dost who'll eat up all your property if taken to an expensive place. For me, this place is a breakfast treat/party hub. For rowers from the Dhakuria lake including me, any major celebration includes an Aloo Paratha treat here in this small eatery. 
What to eat? Order a plate of Aloo Paratha, which will come alongside sabzi and raita. That's all  that takes us to make a big celebration out of the small events. Those crispy, hot, freshly fried aloo parathas are just the perfect blend of unhealthy(contains a lot of oil and butter) but immensely tasty Indian food. It will surely take your taste buds on a roller coaster and trust me, you won't be able to leave the table unless you're dead full. One paratha is mostly enough for an adult, two at most if you can eat a lot.
Now after this treat, if you still got some space left for a drink, do order a Lassi or kesar chai. Believe me or not, if will make you think twice if that's all you want to have or order another glass/cup of the drink. 

A complete breakfast meal will be available to you in this restaurant just opposite the Ballygunge Military Compound.

Sharma dhaba a joint fair enough to say the service section needs a remarkable upliftment  the seating arrangement of bench doesnot fits with such a price tag. My fav dish is keema matar. The indian bread section that is roti is over priced and so are the other dishes. A non ac joint having simple seating arrangement of benches keeping this in view prices need to be considered. Car parking arena is good and one can have the option to sit inside car and have food. The service boys are not well mannered.

Chicken tikka butter masala
Garlic naan
Paneer pasinda kebab
Kashmiri pulao
Kadhai chicken

Gotta mention tandoori aloo and mushroom kebab.

Ya list is long. But its all delicious.
And fresh. They deliver almost 24/7. Minimum delivery order is also reasonable 300. Distance isn't an issue ever.

Even their restaurant is pretty decent.

One of the best place for sabji kachori, lassi and gulab jamuns. Now they also have small baby gulab jamuns that's quite delicious. Ask for fresh garam khachoris this winter and enjoy

You a night owl like me?? You get super hungry at the middle of the night?? Like as if you haven't had a supper?? Here's this place which offers you awesome dhaba food at a good ambience (if you are eating upstairs)...and that too at any hour of night...prices are cheap. Be sure to try the Chicken Tandoori Masala, which is their speciality...its a 4 star for a Dhaba...but you know since its a Dhaba...

It's a boon for the starving souls at odd hours of night in south Kolkata. Yes this is the best thing about them, they deliver to you 24 hours a day. Their food is very pocket friendly as well as good at taste. I had ordered mutton kasha, butter naan, tandoori roti. I like their food. Also good at quantity. And they delivered in 50mins to KPC Hospital 8B, Jadavpur.

Visited this outlet in the evening.. It's almost all time open. Went one day late night too as well as early in the morning. You can have your food in your car or they have a dining area too. They serve exquisite starters as well as main cuisine. North Indian as well as Chinese is available. We had ordered cheese roll, tandoori aloo( it was stuffed with paneer), tandoori Mushroom. Tea here is too good. Many of them just visit to have their tea.

We came during dinner, . 

The butter chicken truly is delicious. I read numerous reviews about the amazing butter chicken - and yes, it was amazing! My loving wife had chicken tikka butter masala which he thought was great as well (I didn't try it). However, what my little family enjoyed most about the food (besides the taste), were the PORTIONS. and the most yummy was  the fat free rolls - we even had left overs! We definitely felt like we got what we paid for.
 

TIP-dear friends this a typical desi  dhaba in the city of joy and the amenities they provide are really excellent   you must try out 

 
and at last i became the fan of  SHARMA DHABA,

I have read some of the bad reviews and it is hard to belive given that I have visited this dhaba on more than 10 ocassions and not once have I had a bad experience. So I truly recommend it to everyone. The food quality and taste are amazing and they have never dissapointed. I do believe the side portions are a bit small but besides that the price is worth it. I personally recommend the  chicken tandoori butter masala which is known as (CTBM)  at sharma dhaba withh soft butter naans are really delicious .and classic facilities they provide food  at your car; typical desii dhaba stylee which i salute them,,

Well, if you like dhaba style preparations, you are going to love this place. Love the tandoori Aloo rolls they make. Real big chunks of stuffed tandoori Aloo packed in a soft rumali roti and served with a green chutney. Simply delicious. A roll costs 150/-, and is sufficient for one! The service here is really quick. Also like the dal and sabzis they make.
A must visit!

Almost everyone around 3 kms I asked to refer a good eating place recommended this place. Just 140/- one chicken biriyani with a biigg piece of chicken. There is no Ac & dont expect anything more than good quality food.

I had a terrible food poisoning the day after having the chowmein. I just had two spoons and with the taste I could make out that it was stale. Yet the food won and gave me a food poison. I wonder what oil they use or they even use oil, many friends have told me that they use dalda. WHATEVER IT IS PLACES LIKE THESE SHOULD BE CHECKED BY MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS AND SHOULD BE SHUT.

NEITHER DO I REVIEW, BUT I HAD TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION CAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE.

A must visit if you like dhaba Style Preparations !!

Located near Punjab club on Ballygunge circular Road, sharma dhaba has been the favourite of all. Although not that famous in comparison to its counterpart balwant Singh and sharma tea, but sharma dhaba provides food with equal taste and flavour.

You can have it inside your car, or can sit inside. I haven't had much opportunity to visit this place. Only once had I gone along a friend of mine. We had ordered paneer tikka and Mushroom tikka. Both were simply amazing and delicious.
Paneer tikka was soft and was served in good chunky squares. A goldenish yellow color of cottage cheese served with green mint chutney.
Mushroom was very tender and superb. One of the best mushroom tikka I have ever had. Just thinking about the dish is making me crave for it and wanting to go back and have it.

This was a rare find and I'd give it a straight 5*. The food was delivered within 45 minutes of the placement of the order and the quality was fantastic! The only problem was that I hadn't expected the mutton dopiyaza to taste sweet, but at the same time, it was quite tasty.

This is the only Dhaba in my area that has a home-delivery service past midnight.

This is a very small joint, always crowded and busy even at 1at night..very lively atmosphere.. 

The staffs were polite . Now to the food we orderd chicken tandoori , butter naan and butter chicken. Tandoori tasted the same as everywhere else but the butter chicken was awesome.. It was rich, tasty and juicy. I njoyed my dinner. Even the price is very reasonable.. Definitely i wud gv it a 4*.

Chicken tikka kebabs, tandoori roti and butter chicken.
Awesomeness. 
Had been to this place on numerous occasions and they have never been disappointing. Fast service, great food.
This place remains open till late night and you can have the food without even stepping out of your car. Efficient waiters, i must say. 

Ps: Do not know whether this is a coincidence or not, but their chicken tandoori makes me run to the washroom with a stomach upset. Happened twice.

I have spent my childhood, teenage, and college days  eating out here with friends and family quite frequently, and even though the frequency has dropped now, the love remains. If not for food, adda sessions with hot cuppa of chai or coffee with my close friends used to be a part of our routine, and I believe many from this part of the city would agree. The food here was The Best when it comes to "dhaba" styled food once upon a time. 

Now, things have changed, and even though the quality is not at all bad, they have not been successful in keeping alive that charm or "wow" factor, and it's disheartening for loyalists like myself. The food is much more oily now, the crowd has depleted, the costs have sky rocketed, and hygiene has taken a back seat for sure. I am not trying to sound like the one who cribs too much, but these are the obvious differences anyone who has been frequenting the place since ten years would agree without second thoughts. 

On my recent experience, the egg tadka we ordered had at least three spoons of dalda floating on it, the butter tandoori roti we ordered came late and cold, but paneer do piaza was better than ever before and made up for it. I would recommend this place, always, regardless of all its shortcomings. Because, nothing is perfect after all.

Ordered home delivery - mutton seekh kabab, chicken tikka masala and luchha paratha.

Each one of the dishes was horrible. The kababs were full of salt and oil, no other flavors could be recognised. The chicken tikka masala was bland, the only thing you could taste was salt. The parathas were hard and difficult to break.

Despite promising a 30 minute delivery time, they took 75 minutes.

Some people call this place a life saver , some a pocket friendly joint. I have been there before to try the chicken tandoori and kebabs before. Last night after a house party, we took a cab there to fulfil an urge to have a nice dinner.
We ordered chicken bharta, mutton kasha and mutton liver masala with tandoori roti. The bharta was excellent and texture was amazingly creamy. It was a bit salty for my taste but my friends enjoyed it thoroughly. The mutton kasha was very nice and the meat was well done. The liver masala was excellent as well and the pick of the dishes for me. The roti they served one by one out of the tandoor so that its always hot. The meal for 4 costed us around 800 which is really pocket friendly. The service is fast flowing and I have no complaints on that. 
This place remains open long into the night to serve as well. Great place for sudden dinner.  I rate it 3.5/5.

This is one of the famous dhabas in Kolkata. It is located opposite ballygunge army camp. Although the place is not that clean and decorative , still the taste of the food beats all the negatives. The best items to try out here is tandoori chicken and aloo do pyaza. There are special arrangements for preparing lassi.

Don't know why youngsters like this place ... it has a great nuisance value apart from being a favorite with pub hopping youngsters since this place is open through the wee hours of mornings. I am not sure what people like about the Indian Veg menu items because except for the paneer tikka and samosa nothing else makes the mark. Service is good if you are a patron and they serve to your cars because the seating is practically absent. Also overpriced.!

Amongst very few places in Kolkata where, ambience sucks, cleanliness sucks, valet parking doesnt exists, always place for one extra customer. BUT...
The food quality and service will make any good restaurant run for its money. I ordered a simple veg roll and chai, the monsoons have reached kolkata and the aroma of tandoor with its 1st batch of chiken tikka...Lovely.

The art is to keep it simple and give a good quality food. Oh yeah, after your party has ended, gorge over here.

Well, it's a dhaba so one cannot really expect great ambience or sanitation for that matter. But it's a very popular hang out place, drawing people from all age groups and from different walks of life. Cons: tea is last served at 9pm which is a bummer. Service is very slow. Little to be said about the decor of the inside. 
Pros: you can take tit bits and carry on for hours. There are sitting areas outside under trees. You can get food delivered to your vehicle if you prefer. They also cater to late night home deliveries.. Sometimes as late as 1.30am!! Alu paratha, chicken biryani, chicken tandoor are great bites!

I have been frequenting this place ever since my school days, so we go a long way back! Be it after a night of partying, for a sumptuous breakfast or just to chill with friends in the evening with samosa and chai, this place serves all! The Chai here is tastefully prepared and served in clay cups. The samosas and other snacks are pretty delicious too. You just need to park your car and someone or the other will immediately pull up and take your order and within minutes you are served by ever smiling faces! 
Next time you are in the mood to just chill with a few friends over tea and cigarettes do visit this place!

I love this little place, it's always full and supremely busy but that's another story altogether, the food served is pure & authentic North Indian delicacies which is reasonably well priced. 
Very rarely I have visited this place at night but whenever we have it has always been a delight to grab a bite from here. They remain open late at night, and mostly remains crowded. 
Their portions are appropriate and food is really good. 
Located in Ballygunge circular road, besides Punjab club, if there one should obviously order their chicken tadka, which is mind blowing! Super tasty and something like a signature dish out here. 
Whenever I have visited this place I have always ordered the same things and rarely I felt the need to experiment. Their shahi paneer, mushroom masala, jeera rice and yellow Dal fry is a must try for everyone. Served hot and fresh along with some supremely crafted nuns it's a heaven for people who love to gorge on authentic North Indian dishes. It's a very good place with good food & service, which is also easy on the pockets. Must try!

food which is good in taste and is also pocket friendly and open till late night then Sharma Dhaba is the perfect joint for u. The place is supremely small and has limited sitting and that too non ac, but it doesn't matter as mostly people eat in their own cars or just pack up things and go home and enjoy it. 
Egg Tadka and roti is one of their most popular dish but one must also try the mutton kosha and mutton keema tadka and palak paneer , butter roti and so on.

We had gone there yesterday we ordered chicken butter masala, mutton keema, palak corn ,scrambled egg n garlic Naan. Excepting the egg which had too many chilly in it Everything else tasted perfect .I'm still giving this place a 2.5 star cause the view of the kitchen is disgusting. The staff r wearing singlets n working wearing chappals. I would blame the management for not taking safety precautions for their staff n it's disgusting to actually see the staff sweating n making the dough.

The food is normal. The menu is long and so are the prices. The menu is a bit overcharged. The lassi is good but the lassi available at other Sharma outlets are much better.

It's a good place to either sit in the car and have food in the heart of Ballygunge or to order in from. The place itself is slightly dirty or ill kept one. But some of stuff sold there are just too good. Try the chicken bharta, tikka butter masala, palak paneer, mutton tikka roll and the chai.
Rest of the stuff is OK ...
It's an experience to have the food in your car in Calcutta... Though a few other dhabas are also doing the same nowadays.

This is one of the best dhabas that I have been to till date. My favourite is the chicken reshmi malai kabab and coffee. The lemon tea is fabulous too. I also loved the chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken kasha. The samosas are also very good. The rotis u order any type are always hot and soft.. In all a must visit for food lovers..

Yay for take away!! Their Rumali roti roll is a good low fat alternative for roll lovers! Vegetarians can try their potato and cheese Rumali roti roll. Fast home delivery too... People with weak stomachs may want to give this one a miss but if you're up to it their rolls are awesome!!!!!

MOOD : After Party, Late night drives, Late night hangout with friends.

Apt place if you are looking for a pocket friendly , casual dinner with friends . Forget about the ambiance & hygiene because your car bonnet & the car is the dinning area for you. If not car its gonna be under the tree.

The service is superb as they get you everthing from water to tissue in your car. 

The total chill out place!

This is one of my favorite hangouts in town and I used to be a regular chap to them. During my days at the military hostel in the Ballygung camp, this is where one could find me and my buddies during either breakfast or evening tea. The aaloo paratha is just awesome and most of the other dishes that they serve, makes you stuffed. People might not find the place hygienic and it's not but who cares.. Starting from tea to lachha, from chicken tandoori to daal task a, Dharma Dhaba has done it right. Mere writing this review makes the old memories float again in my mind and it brings back the taste of their food. I miss the place bad and hope I can visit sometime soon again.

I kid you not, this is the best place ever. If you are going to be finicky about the eating space, then this place isn't meant for you. Not one bit. But the food and the environment, and by environment I am not just referring to the freedom to hangout endlessly, but also the staff who will smile and chat you up, is beyond comparison.

My staples at Sharma include Palak Saag with Tawa Roti. Or their fat free Chicken Tikka Roll, which is by far the best roll I have ever tried in my life.

Pocket pinch wise, it is slightly on the higher side. But I honestly don't mind. I would more than willingly spend over dinner at Sharma than at any other swanky place any day.

Sharma Dhaba has been a part of my Growing up years. My 1st late night drive with friends, 1st midnight chai adda, late dinner after 1st Discotheque visit has all been subjected to this place. And yet again i become nostalgic till today when i visit this place. Last Saturday I met up with one of my oldest friends and like yesteryears after clubbing we decided to go to Sharma Dhaba for a late night grab at it was 3 in the morning when we reached this Place. Disappointing is they have stopped serving tea after 8 and we missed the handsomely boiled milky concoction with a hint of kesar...but what mesmerised was that even the early hours of dawn the quality of food was so fresh. We ordered our Favourite Chicken Bharta which is luxuriously cooked in cashew sauce with oodles of butter justifying the fact that Punjabees don't restrain their hand when it comes to Butter, Milk or Ghee. With it we had piping hot soft yet crispy Tandoori Roti with butter and trust me it was a delight to have. Since this place is a common joint for me I can recommend some dishes which are just too good for a greedy mouth:
1) Chicken Reshmi Kebab: You wont find more succulent well cooked and spiced chunks of chicken in the entire country and i can bet my tongue on it :P. Accompanied by mint and curd chutney and julienne onions.

2) Tandoori Chicken: Well cooked to the T with perfect balance of spices. 

3) Aloo paratha: Fluffy Breads made with a lovely Potato filling and i just love the hint of Coriander in it.

This doesnt feature on Zomato's "Late night eats" list. But it's definitely,definitely on mine. Calorie-rich uncomplicated north indian dishes. Love their chicken bharta with rumali rotis and their Mutton Boti Masala...do try their soda shikanji.Palak paneer was nice too. Chicken Korma too sweet for my taste,though. Many vegetarian options as well. Pocket-friendly. Service is excellent. You can sit inside but people prefer to be served in their cars and so do we. So not much idea about the seating arrangements inside.

I have been here countless time mainly because of its proximity to my college hostel. Brilliant north Indian food that doesn't burns a hole in your pocket. If you are one of those kind who only care about food and not the ambience you will love this place. This is a perfect place to eat when you've been drinking and partying till 2 am and you need to eat after that. My all time favorite here is the spicy 'kadhai paneer'. Along with that their paneer kababs, mushroom mutter and garlic naan are really good. Being a vegetarian, I can't comment about the non veg food here but my non veg friends swear by the chicken tikka masala here. 
If you live in Calcutta and haven't been here you have surely missed something.

This is the joint where you can enjoy with your friends, have authentic punjabi food in your own car parked in front of this dhaba and relish the moment. Specially its a favourite joint for "Late Night Roamers". 

My favourite here is Chicken Tangri Masala with rumali roti, Vegetable Tadka, Tangri Kabaab, Tikka Kabaab, Chiken Bharta (Better than Jai Hind dhaba). Special Mention would be Cheese Garlic Nun.

Food wise its pretty decent as per the price. Service is apt. Go for the chicken malai kebab and the chicken reshmi roll. Happy hogging!! And yea they are open till the wee hours. :)

Just opposite to the Ballygunge Army camp, this place is a gem of a place for awesome food till late in the night. In a city like calcutta where roads are bustling with traffic all day long, and you want a breather, then take a wonderful night bike/car ride to sharma dhaba late in the night when the city is asleep, but the dhaba people are as busy as any other time of the day. They'll serve you with the most delicious food and you will have a treat of your time. You might think, since its late they might be out of food, but ironically the are stocked with enough to feed the hungry customers till late. From the tandoor rotis to the salads to the kadhai chicken to the saag daal to the raita. I can't imagine my get away dinners from  any other place apart from this. Coming to the ambience, its really good, the feel of a roadside dhaba exists, and the brilliant pan shop just outside is a bliss. The only thing that is a little tricky to me is the water they serve. I always carry my own bottled water whenever i go there. But of course you can always order mineral water from them itself.
Rounding it up, it is a must go for all the party goers who are looking for a place to eat in the night or to regular eaters during the day.

How did i miss reviewing this place?? This used to be our regular dinner joint after partying hard all night. i think this is one of the best joints to taste chicken bharta... i remember this item to be on the priority list while ordering food here. Almost all the party animals used to flock into this place after a night of partying, dancing and boozing. All you have to do is park your car infront of the dhaba and a waiter would come to take the order. The food will be served to you on your car bonnet area and necessary items will be arranged. They serve green chillies and onion salad which goes well with any dish you order so do not forget to order this this. The prices used to be quite reasonable back then... i am not sure about the recent pricing as its been almost two years i did not visit this place.

The food can't get better than this. Ordered Chicken Bharta, Butter Naan and Tandoori rotis. Also ordered pea pulao and boondi raita. The food was served in ten minutes and lip smackingly delicious. The bill came to 560 all inclusive and totally worth every penny. If you want authentic dhaba food this is a must visit.
Forget ambience this is as real as it gets in the south of the city and you can sit in your car, there are waiters scurrying all over the place and they are good in terms of service even in the midst of a crowd.Sorry missed taking photos cause as soon as it was served everyone tucked in and there was no stopping till the plates were clean and every last bit was scraped off in minutes.

Sharma Dhaba has been around for ages but I only just discovered it for myself. I read a few reviews on Zomato recently and decided to order dinner from there. The delivery was punctual. The Food was hot. The Packaging was adequate. We ordered a Chicken Reshmi Kebab, a full Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Garlic Naan. The Reshmi Kebab could have been better, it wasn't as soft as I expected. The Tandoori Chicken was fantastic. The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was fabulous. Their Naan's are so big I couldn't even finish one by myself. What took the cake was the Chicken Bharta. Perfectly shredded chicken, right kind of spices in a delicious gravy (I almost didn't miss the cut up boiled egg). It's one of the best Chicken Bharta's in town.

Really enjoyed the food. Unfortunately we consumed it before we could take any photos. I'll certainly be back for more!

It is hard to fathom how I missed reviewing one of my favourite Dhaba's ! Been frequenting this place since I was in my teens .... have very happy associations of the place. Great food , good service and affordable pricing make this an excellent place to eat at. I would not recommend sitting inside ... not a great crowd especially at night and not the most hygenic place ... however they serve you in the car and that is my preferred option. The Chai and Lassi are both very good and I would highly recommend the Chicken Reshmi Kebab Roll or the Egg Bhujia Roll both of which are very good. They use a roomali roti for the roll and I love that rather than the paratha ..... the rolls are large and filling though on the expensive side. 
Coming to the food .... Chicken Reshmi Kebab , Tandoori chicken , Mutton Seekh Kebab , Alu Do Piaza , KaliDal Tadka and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala or Paneer Butter Masala are super yummy and paired with the Tandoori or Roomali Roti make for an excellent repast. Recommended !

its a dhaba which is worth a visit for the love of some great food..each item u will have u would leave the place with a desire of visiting this place again..i visited it for the first time during the pujas with my aunt it is just near to calcutta punjab club..

we ordered for reshmi and sheek kebabs..and had masala kulcha and chicken bharta and paneer butter masala ..the food is finger licking good..kebabs were mindblowing and the masala kulcha and bharta were a must have there ..they made it so deliciously omg and paneer was just fantabulous..i simply loved this place..

u cant expect here to have a 5 star ambience and the food compensates for it..marvelous food ..service is very good and staff is very efficient ..i loved this place..will be visiting it again

I first went to Sharma Dhaba years back when I was looking for unpretentious dhabas to eat at. This place was recommended by a friend, who hesitantly said that food was good, but the ambiance was bad. Honestly I didn't mind and went anyway. I am GLAD I did. It is the PERFECT example of Unpretentious Dhaba with GREAT FOOD.

Firstly a few heads up. It is a small place, with benches as seating arrangements. There is no air conditioning, only fans to keep you cool. If you decide to go in and sit on the benches you may have a Cabbie as you neighbour diner. It isn't a dainty place, it looks a little dirty but not terribly so. Food is served on steel plates not on fancy ones. And yes the food may be a little oily for people on diet.

If you are passing by and you have a car, I would suggest you stay and eat in your car. You can park in front of Sharma Dhaba, servers will come to take your order and serve you neatly in your car with tissue papers and water. Most people do this, and that causes a little bit of rush outside. There are sometimes lack of parking space during rush hours.

However when it comes to the food, I am sure all these above mentioned shortcomings (if they are considered as shortcomings) will lose their significance.

They have absolutely perfect Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Malai kababs, Chicken Butter Masala and a range of other Kababs and gravies to choose from.The Rotis they serve are soft and hot, and Butter Naans are dipped in Butter. Their tea is brilliant and I love their Lassi with Malai. Although I have never tried myself I have heard that the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian dishes. I plan to try soon! This place has Brilliant Quality and generous quantity of food.

A three course meal will leave you over stuffed and will pinch very little out of your pocket.

Another thing which I think is worth mentioning is the service. The servers are very very polite and friendly and patient to say the least . They are also open way past midnight and is a nice place to dine late.

Please try Sharma Dhaba and I am sure you will love it as much as I do. Enjoy

One of our night hangout spot since i'm here in kolkata. Affordable and available whenever you want to take some tasty food. I have tasted almost every item.. among them CTBM is my favourite. Masala kulcha, butter nan, chicken shik kabab masala was among the hits. Only lag point is that it is not air conditioned but still it is one of my best restaurant.

Location: Ballygunge, few minutes away from Calcutta Punjab Club.

There was a time when I used to visit this place thrice a week!
No such ambiance out here, considering it's a Dhaba, it's alright.
And anyway, the quality of food matters more!
Best is you can sit in your car and have the food.
Earlier this place had great quality food, now it's taken a downfall route.
Hope to see it come back with it's old quality!

Coming to the food,

Dal Tadka
Delicious. Perfectly cooked black lentils with the right spices and has a thicker consistency than Dal Makhani

Dal Makhani
Delectable. Perfectly simmered lentils served with a dollop of butter.

Paneer tikka butter masala
This dish is recommended.
Tandoored Paneer pieces tossed into a spicy gravy! The Paneer cubes are soft and succulent.

Aloo do pyaza
Nah, have had better ones at other dhabas.
Needs great improvement.

Malai Kofta
The koftas have a sweet yet tasty filling served in a white gravy.
Tastes great.

Tandoori Butter Roti
Crisp Tandoori Roti brushed with butter.
Actually with dripping butter!
Tastes great!

Butter Naan
Soft and slightly buttered. Perfect.

Garlic Naan
Right amount of garlic put. Is perfectly baked in the tandoor.
Thumbs up.

Masala Kulcha
Flavorful filling but lacking a bit of spices, could have been better.

Tea
Used to come for a cup daily during the winters, but, the last winter I quit.
It's no more the same.

Soda Sikanji
Fizzy and has spot on masala.

The staff is quick and well-informed.
Prices are pocket friendly.

Overall a good experience.
Wish to see it back to the quality it used to serve.

Sharma Dhaba was a well known joint in Kolkata even before the infamous shooting incident took place. And it was famous for all the right reasons. In my case one particular reason. The food. I don't like hanging around this place neither do most of my friends. But lots of youngsters love doing so and are frequent visitors. I too have been there a no. of times as its a walking distance away from my home. The last couple of times though I have been doing their take away.

I love their Kabuli Naan (which is missing from the Zomato menu). Its a huge piece of naan with bits of roasted cashews, raisins and sweetened cherries on top. I can never have enough of that. Order it with the chicken masala or any kebabs in butter masala. And if you are keen to order a kebabs with it go for the tikka kebabs. If you are keen to try out other things I'd recommend the garlic naan, chicken kadai if you are in the mood for something hot and spicy, the tandoori chicken etc. Many people are quite fond of the tadka here, which make no mistake is quite good but in my opinion the one found at The Dhaba, Ballygunge Phari is better. So whenever I have tadka I have it from there. You could also try the tangri kebabs here. 

Its a dhaba so one expects value for money. They deliver value for money except perhaps when it comes to the rolls. Service is quick and efficient and no matte which day of the week you go there you will most likely have to wait to get seated inside. Highly recommended.

They serve one of the best rolls in Kolkata... Be it their paneer or chicken rolls in parathas or their chicken tikka or fish tikka rolls in roomali roti..... their kaali daal/dal tadka parties with paneer tikka butter masala or tandoori aloo butter masala, chicken bharta and tandoori rotis makes for a brilliant meal in the winters

This is THE only place where i would chose to eat vegetarian food over non veg only and only because of the brilliant quality of paneer they use in their cooking . I was introduced to this place when i returned to kolkata after a gap of few years and was going to azad hind for a late night meal . 

My brother  took me here and i am ever so thankful to him for it . I simply drool over the paneer tikka  and the seekh kebabs here are great too . 

one must try the rolls here they are huge and very filling and the dhabe wali kali dal is to die for . The chicken bharta and egg tarka both are awesome as is the keema masala . Over all TOTAL PAISA WASOOL ! pocket friendly and total soul satisfaction .

The best thing about Sharma Dhaba? Its always open. The food is above usual dhaba standards and parking is available in front of the stall itself. As for home delivery, they deliver anywhere and at anytime. Literally. I have ordered food to gariahat at 2am during the pujo season and they've delivered. Lovely place, great staff, highly recommended.

frequent with this place for years now ! Chai has no match !

Favourite adda spot to hangout !
Some snacks are just fab - Cheese Onion Roll 
Paneer tikka and Aloo tikka is also too good to miss out !
I'm a vegetarian.  So not quite sure about the Nonveg food. But yes even non veg people eat their heart out at this fab spot ! Amazing location. 
You get food served in your car. And the service is rapidly fast. 

Anytime after 5pm Sharma - Thumbs Up

Located reasonably close to home, I have not visited this place that frequently. Most earlier visits have been sitting in the car, having a chai and / or kababs. Both were rather tasty, certainly many steps above what they serve at the perhaps better known Azad Hindi Dhaba closeby.

I was surprised to see this place has been done up, and looks much cleaner than before. My friend and I sat down and ordered our meal, which was served very quickly. It was a weekday, about 8.30 pm, and not crowded at all. Only issue were the small cockroaches roaming about, especially on the table.

Now the food. We decided to go for a simple meal. Started with a nice chilled bottle of Thums Up. This was closely followed by our meal which consisted or tandoori chicken masala and rotis. A large place with four pieces of tandoori chicken in a lovely rich gravy (that did not create havoc on my system later). It was yummy... just that the chicken didn't seem the freshest, and was perhaps overcooked. Had that typical smell and was a bit stringy perhaps. The rotis were just as awesome, nicely made, and served with a huge amount of butter on top. Only issue was the waiter served all four rotis simultaneously.

Made for an eminently satisfying meal. Highly recommended, despite the insane amount of calories and other such professional hazards of being a foodie!

Thank you Ifte, my friend.

All in the name of those wild wild days. Late night hopping around the city would evidently bring us, the hungry souls here in search of magic. Crammed by truck and taxi drivers, no proper exhaust facilities, so the walls are black from soot, no a.c of course but... the food! enough to drive you nuts! 

Cream Palak- Smooth creamy and delightful.
Palak Paneer- I love the dish. As for this place, the spinach dishes they cook have a special smooth texture, not even a tinge of bitterness and the paneer is ultra soft.
Chicken Reshmi Roll- I love fewer things in this world more than this. Paper thin roomali rotis wrapped around solid stack of Chicken Reshmi kebab and served with a tangy pudina chutney. Need not say more, I bet!
Dal makhani- Very basic, very creamy, very tasty.
Dahi Mutton- Another classic of Sharma Dhaba. The rich yoghurt based gravy perfectly compliments the hot, crisp tandoori rotis. 
If you really care for  ambiance, Kolkata offers you a gamut of fine dining but if eating like a glutton, experiencing authentic Punjabi taste without burning a hole in your pocket is on your list, go for it!

Sharma Dhaba is not just a great place, it is a savior in times of need. We used to come here before the midnight ban on restaurants was implemented - the place would serve food till 2 am, with or without the permission of police. I go back over and over again for two items on the menu - the Reshmi kabab roll, and the tangri masala. Also, the egg bhurjee with the veg tadka would be another favorite of mine on certain days, not to mention the matar paneer. 

Recently, I went around 8.30 pm and the place was jam packed.  However, we got a table luckily in 5 minutes, and sat down on the benches. We ordered tangri masala, lahsooni naan, egg tadka, palak paneer and lassi. The small place is unpretentious and spotlessly clean. All the food arrived rapidly, within 10 minutes of ordering, and the server gave us onions and chillies to go with the food very quickly. We attacked the food and everything tasted incredibly good, and you could taste the freshness. The paneer was soft and creamy and the lassi was thick and exactly what i wanted. The tadka was also very good.  But the lahsooni naan with the tangri masala again won my heart. Our damage, for four people eating heartily, came to  under 1000/- which was absolutely fine for the quality of food served. Thumbs Up.

Situated bang opposite the Ballygunj Military Camp on Ballugunj Circular Road, this used to be a very good dhaba and was a stiff competition to Azad Hind few blocks away. However I have noticed that the food quality has really deteriorated over the last couple of years. Sharma Dhaba was known for its lip smacking Indian food and a late night hang out place. It was never a family joint, but a perfect place for friends to sip some tea and relish Indian specialties like Chicken Bharta, Butter Tandoori Roti, Chicken Kebabs, etc. 
You can choose to dine in which can barely accommodate 20-25 people or get it delivered to your car outside. The waiters are friendly and provide prompt service. Chicken Malai Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Bharta and Tanoori Roti used to be my favourite here but none of them taste the same anymore. Also the prices have shot up and a meal for two would cost around Rs400. I would rather suggest going to Jai Hind Dhaba near lansdown for a better dhaba food experience. 
I would rate it 3 for the very average food.

Located near school, Sharma dhaba is a frequent hangout place for me and my pals. I haven't experimented with many of the items on menu, but the Alu Paratha (accompanied by aloo sabzi and raita) is well worth the meager price printed in the menu. Not a family joint, it's certainly a place to hang out with friends.

Location: Sharma Dhaba is located between Azad hind Dhaba and Calcutta Punjab club. In the middle, this Dhaba had lost its charm because someone had used a pistol out here. Nevertheless, it has improved now. The total get up of Dhaba has changed and now they have even opened a shop just near to it for retailing services. 

I have been here innumerable number of times and it is a hot spot for youngsters during evening and night time for either some chai or for smoking. This Dhaba serves Indian food. There is a waiter out here who speaks English - Anna is his name so if you want to have a funny time do talk to him. Haha. 

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:-
Pros:
1) located at posh area
2) food is very delicious
3) staffs are very friendly- a small tip would do the trick
4) cost friendly Dhaba
5) service is very quick 

Cons:-
1) eating place needs renovation. Suggested to eat in the car only
2) despite earning so well, they should bring about more dishes in their menu to survive. Competition is high now. 

Must try: vegetarians : paneer tikka kabab, paneer butter masala, malai kofta, dal makhani is better than special tarka, aloo do pyaza and tandoori roti or kulcha not rumali. 

Non vegetarians: chicken tandoori, tengri, malai tikka, Reshmi, tikka , chicken Reshmi butter masala, dal makhani and the breads mentioned above.

Of all the so-called dhabas on Ballygunge Circular Road, this one is possibly the least pretentious. The ambience actually resembles that of a roadside eatery, and the quantities reflect that trend.

The food is quite good. The chicken dishes are standard, but the vegetarian ones are worth having, especially in winter.  This is also one of the few places that serve mutton liver in a variety of dishes. The tea and lassi are standard accompaniments.

The service is average, but the waiters try and maintain an informal atmosphere.. Keeping the prices in mind, a little more cleanliness would be desirable. Overall, a good place to go to for North Indian food.

This place is frequented mostly by labourers and taxi drivers for their hard earned midday meal. But inspite of poor ambience and lacklustre waiters, the food is decent. At least the thalis fill your belly,if not tickle your tastebuds. Oddly, they dont use sauce in their rolls, unless you specifically ask for it beforehand. Its probably best if you go to the nearby Azad hind dhaba during the lunch hours. The thing that Sharma's is good at is making their special tea. Its real good,and they serve it in huge earthen cups. I often have breakfast here when there's a break in office. I guess the early morning and late evening crowd is more hip than the basic lunch time period. Some of the items might be a bit overpriced considering this to be just a plain low class dhaba, but then again,I guess Ballygunge is an expensive place. Often , rich young people drive up in cars and get their food delivered straight to the vehicles. Overall..I'd say Lunch isnt worth it here. But if you are in the area, do try their special tea and samosas.

One of the best places in town if you want to have nice Panner Tikka or Aloo Tikka. Frankly, everytime i have been to this place these are the only two things i have tried. Never went there for a full meal since this has always been a place for good eat outs late at night. Drive there and you'll have someone immediately guide you to a place for you to park you car, place your order and there you have it in the car. Chatni that is served with the Tikkas tastes better than anything else.

Heard lots of good things about this dhaba so went there today but i was disappointed, though the place is very cheap and the proportion of food is very large but food items are not tasty at all, masala kulchas were excessively big, thick and rubbery, mutton tarka was very bad,distasteful, mixed veg was decent.. i have no idea about their kababs but veg items were not good..

I used to teach part time at Army Public School for a year and half or so. On many occasions I skipped breakfast at home and head for school, only to come out hungry. This place has rescued me on so many occasions. 

However, their lunch time crowd won't be very appetizing to the ones who value ambiance. It usually will be frequented by taxi drivers, bus drivers, local worker and labourer etc. This is because they serve normal lunch. However, the ideal time to go to Sharma is early morning or from the evening till late night. One could however also opt for home delivery. They also provide you with the comfort of serving it to your car, if you have it parked out side.

Must haves :

Tea - They make amazing tea. You might irk to shed 10 bucks for a tea( bongs as we are), but there are very few places who make the tea as good.

Mutton Tarka - With bold mutton pieces inside the tarka dal, this makes for a great meal with any kind of roti.

The prices are moderate and the service is also the same. Again, the ambience is not that exciting. The place faces stiff competition from Azad Hind, which is a stone's throw away but is just as good. The food wont be anything extraordinary, but good and decent food.

You are hungry, you are near ballygunge circular road - ajc bose jntion, dont have a heavy pocket, go to Sharma Dhaba. The place is not so decorated, but you have the choice to park your car beside the resturant and have the food delivered at your car. 
Resonable and tasty food. The mutton biriyani accompanied with chicken chap is my personal favorite, and chicken bharta comes close second. 
I once heard that there is a claywork by eminent artist late M.F.Hussain in one of the walls of the resturant, but somehow never understood which one.

This non-AC family restaurant serves you a variety of Indian cuisine. If you are looking for a comfortable spot to just chill out with your family, consider Sharma Dhaba. Here, youll get dhaba-style food in the security of city limits. The stuffed parathas go nicely with mutton, chicken and vegetarian gravy dishes, and even with tasty pulaos, if you are a rice-eater. Finish off with a round of ice creams to complete your meal.
