Very bad place. Food is very bad. The quality and quantity of the food both are very bad. Food is tasteless. The ambience is also not so good. Had to wait a long time for my food to arrive. The food is excessively priced and the quantity comparatively Is very less. Even roadside food would be much much better than food served here. Finally when the bill came they even charged service charge and on denial from giving service charge they came to argue with us as to why we would not pay the service charge. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Overall experience was very bad.
Food:1/5
Ambience:2/5

The service was pretty slow. Which was unexpected. A bit faster service is needed. Hookah was good. Starters were delicious. Apart from that no entry in shorts. Thanks to the guy who let me in. But please stop that. :/

We went there for lunch. I saw this is a newly open restaurant at another website. So we want to try this one. I just bought family lunch from that website. The restaurant at 4th floor which is not noticeable from outside. Very difficult to find out. When we enter at the gate, we discovered that it is a just a hookah bar. They also provide food but their main business is hookah. Also under 18 year of age are not allowed here. We don't have any time for another place. The manager arrange our table one side of the restaurant. We found that full of smoke around here. We just want to complete our lunch and leave as soon as possible... They serve us non veg Indian food. Chicken sweet corn Soup, chicken kabab, roti, naan, peas pulao, daal, chicken butter masala and ice cream.. Food taste was OK type but quantity wise very less. Normally I tried many restaurants, this restaurant provide too less quantity food which is not enough for two. I strongly warn those foodie who want good food and good hangout. If you like hookah then u can try, otherwise plz avoid this restaurant. One important thing I just forget to mention, they even forgot to serve drinking water. 
Food : 3.5/5
Atmosphere : 3/5
Service : 1/5
Pricing : 3.5/5

The hookah is disgusting, if we complain that the smoke is not dense they only suggest that we have to change the coal, completely ridiculous advice. Hookah was served to our table. It took 10 mins max and we had to change the coal. Expensive shit for nothing. They charge for 45 rs for the coal change n it is completely ridiculous to waste money here. Came with my friends here and not a nice playlist to enjoy.

visited this place  yesterday with friends and i loved the place. chicken tikka and chicken fried rice was yummy, could've ate my finger if possible xD.. staffs assisted us politely and humbly. hookah is great! hookah lovers got their place to chill out. a preferred flavour i would suggest is royal pan gum. cozy seats, a place to hangout with groups and gf. all is great! and I loved it overall

Discovered this place via zomato, otherwise no hoarding or signboard is seen anywhere near the entrance or adjoining lanes, making it hard to locate. I being a local to that area, could follow the address given in zomato.

The place is modestly decorated but something incomplete with the interiors makes it look shabby. Coming directly to food, I was disappointed that so many things listed on the menu was not available and the waiters were somehow trying to convince us to order some particular dishes again and again. We settled for

Cheese fondue: it was nice except garnishing the toasted breads with coriander leaves is a big NO.
Masala french fries: I somehow did not like this one. Also it was pan-tossed and garnished with coriander messing up with the taste even more.
Spring rolls: to my surprise I liked this one. Though the sauce served alongwith it, was a total downer.

The two things I liked the most that upped my ratings were
Crunchy liqueur, it like a crunchy frappe, balanced sweet and coffee flavors and
Truffle shake, which was a chocolate shake with truffle sauce and brownie.

The place is new but the cutlery seemed worn out. Presentation needs working. Prices are fine but they also charge extra for services, which can be looked into. They have a potential to stand out if some corners are focused on to.

Beauty at its best is what the ambience is all about I can say. The name justifies the interior done. 
Food is awsome as far as Tandoori , Indian , Chinese  and conti. All dishes are really garnished well and served. 
Mocktails are mind blowing. 
Shisha at its best.
And last not the least staff and managers are so polite and well trained that they even don't give a single chance to complain   .
Nice place to visit again and again for food lovers and shisha.

Immediate plan and we could decide of nothing except Junk house which was just near to my place so a bunch of us went there... Nd honestly speaking the ambience was quirky... We ordered momos, chilli paneer, babycorn, cheese sandwich, lemon ice tea and hookah.. The service was prompt nd the staffs were very polite and friendly.... However the music was not that rocking... Overall the place is OK... Bt I won't  refer it as 'amazing'
