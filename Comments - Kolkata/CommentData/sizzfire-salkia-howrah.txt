Good service.
Best pizza ever had 'thin crust extra cheese' fingure licking😋😋. Suggested 'kittkat smoothie' mind refreshing for chocolate lovers. Best in salkia. Going to rock really awsome..

It's really amazing!! The food presentation and taste both are great. We ordered Oreo shake, lasagne, baked Mexican rice, sizzling French fries, pizza, crispy fried babycorn, American corn pepper salt, tuti fruity, mojito and sizzling brownie. Oreo shake looked so tempting and it's really one of the best I had and so was tuti fruity. They serve really great pizzas - one of the finest in Kolkata. Baby corn and American corn pepper salt were super yummy and crunchy. French fries were nice. Mojito, tuti fruity and sizzling brownie were great too. Baked Mexican rice and lasagne were also awesome. I would recommend this place to everyone.

Sizzlers in Howrah!? That too PureVeg Sizzlers!? A hidden Gem quietly tucked away in a corner, finding this place is like finding a 100 rupee note in your old jeans! With Prices and Offers that would make any Sizzlers joint in Kolkata say "Are you Crazy?!", they provide some of the best and amazing deals just not in Howrah but I can safely say in the whole of Kolkata too!

The best outlet in the food court of Aurobindo Mall, no second thoughts about it. The Sizzling Red Fry Babycorn, Mexican Sizzler, Hot Sizzling Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream is a must try.
Among the Beverages, Oreo Smoothie steals the limelight.
A special mention about the counter staff, it is very courteous and explains the Menu really well... 👍
