Went there on a dry day i.e Muharram. The ambience is nice, price is decent compared to other equivalent star hotels. If you need a place to chill late night you can always opt for Sante.

The watering hole in Novotel....Wth a well stocked bar. Amazing ambience and unlike most bars which are generally dimly lit this one because of it location and glass panels is bright and welcoming. Seating too is very comfortable.We only had breezers....So what to comment. But the bartender seemed capable.

Decent place to hang out with friends and decor is really nice but can't say the same about service or the food for this place.. It can improve but it's a great hanging out place

Superb ambience. Happy hours is super crazy.    Staff is friendly and nice. Decor is modern and contemporary. Finger food is nice. Music can be better. Sofas are super comfy. A great place to hang out with friends post work.

Visited thrice. Sporty, chic and comfortable. A special mention of the chief bartender who was very polite and jovial. I am more of a cocktail person and a fussy drinker and he made sure I was satisfied. Looking to visit again.

Options on food were lucrative but the taste and texture killed it :(

Ambience - good
Hospitality - good
Food - not good
Alcohol - awesome!!

Stopped by for a quick beer at this place and sat in the comfortable lounge area (there's a bar and wine rack as well). Nice looking place though didn't stay long enough to form a definitive opinion. One odd thing was a foosball in the bar area - looked completely out of character!

Nice place. Visited twice with my brother and once alone. Bartenders were very friendly. Would prefer the lights to be dimmed as it is very very bright with lights at its fullest..
