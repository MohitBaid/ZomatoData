These are special mention to addition these days they make Rabri, Baked mihidana, Baked rosogolla, amd few special mention includes the paneer cutlet.
Suresh is ultimate destination for all sweet lovers in Dhakuria area to be honest I am in love with the sweets here.

The shop may not be big or glitzy, but their sweets are actually tempting in taste. If you are nearby Dhakuria railway station, do drop here for a sweet treat. I have been here countless number of times since my workstation is close by. My personal favourites are chocolate sandesh, paneer chop, baked rosogollas and Kachori with aloo dum. I love their tangy,creamy yoghurt too!

Great tasting sweets, TERRIBLE hygiene. I really used to enjoy the rabri from Suresh, till I realised how gross and ill maintained the premises were. 
I drew the attention of the shop employees to the multitude of bees swarming the glass counters and sweet trays. All I got is blank stares and then ridiculous excuses such as ‚ÄòBees collect honey from the sweets‚Äô üò≥
Did i mention giant black ants roaming the lower racks and having a field day. The employees were were dirty soiled clothes, no gloves, had like 5 kilos of dirt under their finger nails - I just couldn‚Äôt help noticing. Eewwwwwwww
Definitely won‚Äôt go unless the management pick up the game and tidy up. Rather not eat sweets than get food poisoning.

Many of our acquaintances have brought home sweets from this shop, and all of us have been impressed by the quality that has been maintained throughout these years. Sweets have been ordered from here for family gatherings and other celebrations too. The lyangcha, rosomalai and sandesh are my picks.

A lot of people dont know about this place, but they serve really good sweet, the aunthetic Kolkata sweets. Although their shop is small but is always crowded. The "Nolen Gur (jagerry) makha sandesh is a must try during winters. Even the other sweets are really amazing like the chom choms, simple sandesh, kheer langcha. If you are sweet lover you must try this place.

Another nostalgic moment, this outlet is located just opposite to my grandparent's house , in dhakuria station road. So, ever since I was a kid, I have been having their sweets in every occasion-- for ourselves, for guests, for bijoya dashami or anything else. My family cannot think of any other alternative to this shop, mostly because it has still not being commercialized, and they continue to sell good quality sweets in reasonable rates.¬† My favourite is the mishti doi which my grandmom buys for me whenever i visit them on sundays

They serve the best in the area... Rationally speaking, their quality outmatches the quality of sweets offered by Kamdhenu (according to what I feel). But the main problem is they run out of stock as the demand is quite high.

Location - There are 2 outlets of Suresh Mistanna Bhandar. One is near babubagan which is the older one and another is in dhakuria station road which opened much later. For both the branches the sweet comes from the same place. 
Sweets- I have been having sweets from this place for the last 20years and I am never disappointed. The price is reasonable ,the quantity,the quality and hygiene all are up-to-mark and best in class with the price range they offer.
The snacks is also highly recommendable for this place - The radha ballavi, the singara are some of their best
Recommendations- Malai chomchom,baked rosogolla, chocolate sondesh,Misti doi

The densely populated area of Dhakuria had been devoid of a quality sweetmeat shop for a long and Suresh Mistanna Bhandar near Dhakuria Station has been filling the void quiet well for couple of years. The shop has already garnered accolades in the vicinity for the wonderful quality of the sweeta they serve. The chocolate sandesh is really tasty at a standard price. Special savouries like Aam Doi, Raabri are too good. Even they serve delectable samosas in evening. Huge demand always find the store full of admirers.  
Overall a sweet destination for all sweet lovers.

ONE OF THE BEST SWEET SHOP OF SOUTH KOLKATA...... They never dissapoint with their quality,never, be it any kind of sweet or snack. Their baked rasgolla and baked mihidana are absolutely scrumptious. Their shorbhaja,shorpuriya(which is a speciality of krishnanagar) are also very good. Prices are a bit on the higher side but worth the quality they produce undoubtedly. A mouth-watering experience everytime one visits there.

One of the best sweetmeat shops of South Kolkata, tucked away in the bylanes of Dhakuria. The mishti doi, Shor Bhaja, Rosogollas and Patishaptas are pretty much awesome (to say the least). The Radhaballavi and the Singaras are delectable. Prices are pretty reasonable, and the quality is top class. It can be well appreciated that they are a shop specialising in predominantly Bengali sweets. You can try out any kind of sweet or other delicacies from here. One thing is guaranteed....there is not an iota of disappointment in their menu.

A popular sweet shop at Dhakuria, this particular store is famous for their quality sweets without hurting the pockets of the customers. Maintaining a high product value, each and every product of theirs is highly appreciated and longed for. I have tried the Radhaballavi, Roshogolla and Mishti Doi, and must admit was pretty impressed by each one of them. A must try place if you are around.

'Suresh er Misti' is a common phrase in my household and my father being a rosogolla fan has brought the sweet home from this stellar sweet shop on numerous occasions. Frankly I have never been to the shop myself but have heard about it from lots of folks who stay in dhakuria. 

I have also tried their nolen gur er sandesh in winters and they are worthy on mention.

Consuming their products since 1984, when we moved in close by. None comes close to the quality in the vicinity, forget the popular "brands" of sweet shop chains who draw attention with neons, corporate like counters, glass fronts and flashy interiors. Suresh is still remains the quintessential "parar mistir dokan" (your neighborhood sweets shop) where the old dadu, dida comes with their grandchildren, the boudi orders the essential sweets for the arriving guests.
Name anything they produce, be the modest rosogolla (plain, gur, baked) to rasa malai, kora pak, rabri, or a huge variety of sandesh, Suresh does no compromise to the true taste and high quality of their products. Now that I live 7km away (since early 2000's) , I try to visit whenever I am in the neighborhood for a reason.

As it is located near my friends house have always got sweets from here. The recent visit got me some Malai Misti round white shaped and sandesh as well. I just loved their products it's pure Bengali and serves with great taste. Quality is top notch and staffs are very good service and behavior. Misit doi from here is also among my favorites I would recommend this place to all the sweet lovers specially as they are really good.
Other usual sweets like Laddu , jolbhora sandesh etc are also recommended for authentic taste.

Suresh is a house hold name for any and every one living in the Dhakuria and Jheel Road area. You would not find one single person who has not tried sweets from this shop. The place has been around for many decades now, and with the quality of sweets they provide, I would not be surprised if even my grandchildren know about this place. Honorable mention goes to their pantua, shor bhaja, jol bhora tal shash, malai chomchom - the list literally goes on and on. The price may be a bit on the higher side, but they do not compromise on taste, which makes paying for it justified.

Last day, my dad got some sweets from them.

The 'kancha golla' type mishti was less sweet and filled with molten gur. I also tasted a few butterscotches in there. It was super tasty!¬†

The white one tasted more like a 'chom chom' and it was good too. Do try out Suresh's mishti!

This may look like any other sweet shop in the city, but is in fact, no less than a treasure trove. It is immensely popular in the locality and it's Singaras and Kochuris fly off the shelves every evening. My favourites here are the Roshomalai and the Rabri. The Rabri here is phenomenal and come in small plastic containers which they seal perfectly if required, so that there's no spillage of the lovely liquid on the way.

Surely finds a place in the hidden gems as well as in the legendary categories in Kolkata. One of the best sweet shop I have come across. The location might be a little tricky for the first timers but I would suggest you an easy way to get there and that is you have to go to the opposite side of Dakshinapan shopping complex and then ask anyone around where Suresh is and they will surely guide you. Everyone in Dhakuria knows this shop in and out. This is the most obvious and easiest way I could give you. The shop is small and considering the fact that it is always crowded it actually becomes difficult to get space at times. They serve a variety of sweets unlike other old sweet shops. Today I tried their chocolate mishti,shwar bhaja,chchana bhaja,malai chomchom. Their sweets are always amazing and they never disappoint me. Similarly, their chocolate mishti was amazing and one of the best I had I town. The shwar bhaja and the chchana bhaja too were superb. Not the best I had but certainly amongst top 3 according to me. The malai chomchom was very soft and juicy. My favourite chocolate mishti is from this shop itself which unfortunately isn't available all the time. That sweet had a gems on top of it making it even better. I will keep visiting this shop as I am a sweet tooth and for people like me such shops are a paradise.

One of my favourite places to have sweets from! A really old shop that boasts of the best quality sweets in that area!I think I have tried almost all their products!!They keep many variants of chocolate mishti!According to me-one of their chocolate mishtis is the BEST chocolate mishti ¬†in the entire city!! The only bad thing is not all their products are available all the time-the favourite chocolate mishti that I mentioned about is available only during the winters as because it would melt in all other seasons...also none of their sweets come with a name tag so many a times we don't know their names-but the staff is well informed so that is not a big problem.Today I tried the only chocolate mishti that is all season available here,swarbhaja,chhana bhaja and ras malai! All were good!! its amazing how the first bite of any of their sweets brings a smile to ones lips-truly amazing!Their radhaballavis are another of my favourites that are really good and worth a try! Their rabri is another speciality that one must try....overall this place would prove to be a heaven for the ones with a ¬†sweet tooth!

Bengali sweets at its best. It's been here for a while now, quite popular amongst fellow Bengalis and non bengalis equally. Located at dhakuria area , this little shop is situated very close Binodini school for girls. Do not let the size of the shop deceive you, this place is sheer gold. There's always a good number of customers piling up for different kinds of sweets, snacks. I personally love their aam sandesh, chocolate mishti and sita bhog. The Radha Ballabi and samosa that is available during the breakfast hours and the evening time is absolutely lip smacking. The lyangcha, gulab jamuna is supple and sweet without being overpoweringly sugary, which is great. At times the rush is so overwhelming that the owners have a hard time handling them and catering to their requirements. Must try!

The people of Dhakuria and nearby areas swear by their Rosogollas. I went to a marriage and they arranged sweets from Suresh. Both the rosogollas and sandesh were yummy. Really good. Though i feel Chittaranjan in north Kolkata is the best in the city but for south Kolkatans, this is a good alternative.

So my relatives stay in Dhakuria. Many a times when we fly via Kolkata, and have enough time on our hands between connecting flights, I visit them. 

And what is a visit to Kolkata, if you've never tried out the world famous "chenna" sweets. If you dont know what Chenna is, you are really missing out on some of the best sweets. If google isnt able to guide you in the right direction, Chenna is made from the fat of milk. Somewhat like Paneer but not exactly the same. The difference is quite subtle, but I tell you that makes a world of difference in the sweets. Can't imagine eating Paneer rasgulla, can you? ;)

Anyway, without further digressing, Suresh Mistanna Bhander i,e Suresh's Sweet Shop, is a small outlet situated in a nondescript bylane in the old world charm filled labyrinth, that is Kolkata. That was a mouthful, just like their sweets. My relatives have known them for a long time and the shop guys usually recognise us when we visit. Conversation usually goes like," oh you are that cousin from BLR for whom we pack lots of sweets". Guilty as charged, I accept, Ive a sweet tooth and a tummy to show for it. 

It is this familiarity that sets you at ease when you are at the store, not worrying too much about - "Log kya kahenge, kitna mithai thusega (what will people think at the amount of sweets you are gulping)." Feels like that mom n pop shops, where the aunty / uncle would know you personally and you wouldve a chat everytime you visit. 

Over the recent years their menu has become modern to cater to the newer generation of customers, who want to savour fancy named sweets. But trust me, the way they make those sweets has remained the same. The same high quality milk used for preparation and the taste hasn't gone down. Making desserts is an art, I've always considered. These folks have mastered it over the ages. 

Enough of my ramblings, here are the two types of sweets you are gonna get there. Sugar syrup based and Jaggery based. Both types taste equally great in their own way. My personal favourites are - 
1. Gurer rosogolla ( Jaggery based rasgulla)
2. Jol bhora (Jaggery based sandesh with liquid jaggery syrup inside) 
3. Patishapta peethas - no idea what its exactly called in English
4. Baked rasgullas - part of the newer gen items made of gur (jaggery)
5. Gurer rasamalai - again another jaggery based item. 

You will be wondering most of my favourites are Jaggery based. Thats cause the jaggery from date palm is quite famous in West Bengal and especially in winters nothing beats a hot cup of chai made with Jaggery instead of sugar. Try it sometimes, you'll thank me for it :)

The best time to visit would be during the evening, when everything is fresh off the oven - the rasgullas will be piping hot and melt in the mouth - so heavenly. Summer time I usually prefer the sugar syrup rasgullas in the evening - winters my preference shifts to Jaggery based ones. 

Also, point to note, if you need a big order to be fulfilled, better to inform them the previous night or early morning, so that its ready by mid day. 

And before I forget, do try the Joynogorer moa. If you liked it, let me know as well :)

I had thet sweets couple of year ago, I didn't know that they existed on Zomato with very good rating, and this rating worth it seriously. Very good pricing on sweets and this was one of the oldest shop in dhakuria.. very friendly staff I remembered and they served very good langcha.

The people of Dhakuria and nearby areas swear by their Rosogollas. I went to a marriage and they arranged sweets from Suresh. Both the rosogollas and sandesh were yummy. Really good. Though i feel Chittaranjan in north Kolkata is the best in the city but for south Kolkatans, this is a good alternative.

So my relatives stay in Dhakuria. Many a times when we fly via Kolkata, and have enough time on our hands between connecting flights, I visit them. 

And what is a visit to Kolkata, if you've never tried out the world famous "chenna" sweets. If you dont know what Chenna is, you are really missing out on some of the best sweets. If google isnt able to guide you in the right direction, Chenna is made from the fat of milk. Somewhat like Paneer but not exactly the same. The difference is quite subtle, but I tell you that makes a world of difference in the sweets. Can't imagine eating Paneer rasgulla, can you? ;)

This place has become a part of life for past 4 years. I still remember the day my brother brought 'Misti doi' and 'Jolbhora' home from Suresh and our love affair started since.
From rosmalai to malpoa, sandesh to pantua each item is superb and it does stands tall among all its competitor nearby.¬†
The rosogolla is a bit down for me, because i dont prefer spongy ones.
Coming to their USP, Misti Doi. Undoubtedly the best I have had. Perfect.

Located at Maharaj Tagore Road near Dhakuria bus stand this place is slowly spreading it's wings. The demand for the sweets of Suresh is so huge that they have also opened another shop at Banerjee Para juncture.The shop offers a wide array of items to choose from be it sweets or snacks.The best sellers being chocolate sandesh,butter scotch sandesh,black currant sandesh,mango yoghurt (aam doi),mouchak,rosogolla (ranging from 7 to 10),langcha,bonday,roasted kaju sandesh & rosho malai.The latest additions are ice cream sandesh,baked mihi dana and baked rosogolla.In snacks they have singaraa.kachori,vegetable chop,bread paneer chop and radhaballavi with aloor dam.My personal favourite being the baked rosogolla dipped in jaggery syrup.But this particular add on is only given during the winter.
Suresh by the virtue of its excellent products has already taken over business of its competitors who were doing good for sometime.Though a favourites among the locals of Dhakuria,Suresh is a little behind in the rat race of being amongst the top sweet shops of Kolkata due to its locational disadvantage.Fellas donot go by the books or published list of some daily and do drop in. I can vouch Suresh Mistanna Bhandar will win you over with its sweetness.????‚ò∫

Well, heard about this place from my cousin and had to taste sweets of different shops to select and order sweets for my Sister's marriage for 350+ guests. We had 2 shops in target. This one and Ashirbad Sweets(Ballygunge Station).

Sweets:
Gulab Jamun (8.5/10): Soft and Tender, tasted simply WoW!
Rasgulla(5/10): The rosogolla was not at all good. It had the taste of Raw sugar and it wasn't soft, but elastic type. If you try to cut it with a spoon, it will drain out all its juices and will be tough to cut too. It doesn't melt in your mouth.

We needed Sandesh too, but we decided to wait for the "Nolen Gurer" season. Tasted the sweets and took samples and came to Aashirbad ,tasted and took the same sweets. Just that, I've had from Ashirbad a hundred times.
The comparison gave Aashirbad the upper hand.
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

I have had sweets from here for a long period of time and it is one of the best in the business. Whenever there is any occasion or we feel our taste buds deserve something more than just sweets, we go for Suresh. The taste of each and every piece here is heavenly and it is definitely recommended to every one in Kolkata.
This Saturday, I was walking by this outlet in a hurry, but then had to give in to the greed of the delicacies on offer. A quick bite on two rosogullas dipped in dense kheer was something to die for. There are many more to be excited about, and I am sure once you have something from here, you will keep coming back.

Good Dhakai Sweets at my doorstep. Most of the sweets are awesome and very tasty. The Pantua, Chhanar Polau, Mihidana, Baked Rosogolla, Roshomalai, Chhanar Payesh, Rabri are delicious. Their signature is the Shor-Bhaja which is perfectly fried and sweetened and stuffed with sweet khova. 

They also prepare Singara, Radha Ballavi, Paneer Chop, Vegetable Chop and Dhokla in quick bite items. The Dhokla is a bit on the drier side, though.

Overall, it's a famous sweet shop in South Kolkata.

Suresh is like a part of our family. Whatever we eat as sweet, comes exclusively from here. The quality is great and consistent and it can give many reputed chains a run for its money. It has lots of varieties also. Its a request for all the misti snobs to please come down to Dhakuria and try its sweets. It will change your favourites.

I regularly buy sweets fro here whenever there is an occasion or to send to outstation whenever an opportunity is there.
Good items here are the Gurh sweets particularly Gurh Rashmalai variety of Naram Paak Sandeshes Baked Gurh Rashogolla Plain Rashogolla Baked Mihidana Sweet Curd Rabri. They sell some Salty items such as Shingaras Radhaballabhis Kachuris.
The best thing about Suresh is the tasty Gurh sweets particularly Rashmalai and Baked Roshogollas. There is usually always a small crowd waiting for their turn. All items sold here are fresh and I like their taste.
Their pricing is very moderate and quality is excellent.
This is a shop which makes East Bengal Dhakai style sweets
I like this shop more than others to buy sweets in Kolkata.

This is located in my own neighbourhood so I visit here a lot. They specialize in quality when it comes to sweets but also you can try the samosas and kachori in the evening.. but you have to be lucky as they finish very fast. The pick of the sweets are the gulab jamun and lady kenny sweets. During winter they are famous for notun gur(jaggery) er misti and i simply love the butterscothc sandesh that they do. Excellent place and one of the best in South Kolkata.

One of the best sweet shops in Dhakuria.Traditional Bengali sweets are available here--many people would be ordering sweets in bulk from here for occasions like marriage and engagement or Puja s. The quality of sweets is very good though it is much costlier than other sweet shops around. In winter nalen gurer Rasmalai is fabulous. And one more thing they don't give discounts even on bulk order.

For a small sweet shop located in a nondescript corner of Dhakuria Station Road , Suresh remains the clear winner in the Dhakuria ‚Äì Jodhpur Park ‚Äì Selimpur vicinity.

It is on the narrow street once you take the first right turn starting on Dhakuria Station road (From Bibi of Taaja‚Äôs).

The quality of sweets , even after so many years has not gone down at all !

It is a delight to have the NIKHUTI , the 10 rupees RAJBHOG , the RASOMALAI or THE RABRI from Suresh.

Also , one of the very few joints where you can get SINGARA , KHASTA KACHURI , RADHA BALLAVI and NIMKi ‚Äì all 4 non-sweet snacks.

During winter , the NALEN-GURER RASOMALAI and the NALEN-GURER BUTTERSCOTCH SANDESH (the 10 rupees ones) taste out-of-the-world.

Example of a sweet shop , where , word-of-mouth is their best advertisement !

Kudos ! !

Not many people know about this typical Bengali 'mishtir dokan'. But its quite famous in the Dhakuria, Jodhpur Park neighbourhood. In fact in one of the Times of India surveys conducted few years back, Suresh Sweets featured in top 10 of the best sweet shops in south Kolkata. Therefore true to its reputation, Suresh offers you a wide range of authentic as well as modern bengali sweets and snacks. Quality is top notch and price is quite reasonable considering their quality and the prices offered by competitor shops. It is situated inside a bylane near the Dhakuria Kalibari and anybody can give you the directions once you reach that landmark.
