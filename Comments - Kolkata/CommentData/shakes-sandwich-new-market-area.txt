The sole reason for trying this eatery out was because of the catchy name. It is located in shady lanes between Citimart and New Empire Building.

We went forward and ordered for Mushroom Sandwich. the order delivery was too late as the owner cum prepareer was off for a while.

The sandwich tasted okayish but it did not have seem to satisfy me much.

Well, not a recommended visit!

নিউ মার্কেট এর কাছা কাছি ,  ঠিক ঠাক দামে পেট ভরানোর জন্য চলতেই পারে । নাম টা খুব শোনা গেলেও স্বাদে আহামরি কিছু নয় । তবে পরিস্কার এবং টাটকা ।

Having heard a lot about this place I finally gave it a try and it was a total disappointment. Yes they make fresh new sandwiches for you, right in front of your eyes. But the taste and the ingredients used was of really bad quality. We had tried paneer tikka sandwich and corn and cheese sandwich. And truly speaking, they were not edible.

A very affordable quick bite joint located beside lane of the city Mart Mall. Mainly the sandwiches are quite in demand as they made it very well at a low cost also momos are one of the hot selling item too.
My choice was the bar b que sandwich which stand out the best among others my friends tried. Though I found the momo very average but this joint is seriously doing very well and popular among the regulars in this area.

A good place to try snacks at economical pricing at New Market Area. Popular mainly for their Sandwiches, the shakes though appear to be quite average. They also happen to sell some combos, which I plan on trying in my next visit.

Situated near new market area. Small outlet with 4-6 tables to sit. Serves sandwiches, momos and shakes. Friendly staff. Nice ambience and Good hospitality. Service in reasonable time and presentation was average. Tried their grilled sandwich it was mouth watering Delicious. Properly filled with veggies and cheese tastes fantastic. Their momos were also very good but shakes were average. Loved it. Recommended for sandwiches.

Located in Esplanade, near Sree Ram Arcade. Since this place is on a narrow lane, it adds to the Cons of the place.

The Ambience and decor is nothing much to boast about. It is a very small outlet, with few tools provided to seat on. So basically, it lacks in proper seating arrangement. (That's another con. Isn't it ? )

Tried the Chicken Sandwich and Bar B Q Paneer Sandwich. Since I was in a hurry, couldn't try the shakes I wanted to. (The Reviews speak good about the shakes. So ! )

However, the Sandwiches tasted good and the price is justifiable. So an outlet can not have all Cons. Right ? :D

Overall, for hanging out with your people and running on low budget, It's always good. Or maybe, on lazy days ! ^_^

P.S. - Next Mission: Shakes.

I really like this place so much. Many people are unaware of this place owing to its location. But for someone like me who is so well versed with New Market area, this was a cakewalk. I have been here many a times. I believe that instead of spending so much in MacD / KFC, you get better sandwiches and shakes here at a very very reasonable price. Whenever I am shopping in New Market, I stop here and try my favourite grilled chicken cheese mayo sandwich .
