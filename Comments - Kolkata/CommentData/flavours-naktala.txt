They Are Pathetic!
Avoid these Outlets is suggested as they don't have their menu cards(read rates) updated in the platforms from where they have their business.So when the delivery boy arrives he negotiates a higher rate ,that too,without a bill ! When asked for a bill the guy who picks up the call starts negotiating and nagging .They don't pay taxes perhaps,they dont have rate charts right and they are not sorry for that.Pathetic Flavour

This is a small food joint near naktala. I have tried their chicken gravy noodles before but today I have ordered double egg &  double chicken moglai. Quantity was good with 4 pieces of moglai paratha, potato curry, salad. it was enough for 2 person as a evening snack. Quality was fresh and taste was also great. their packaging was standard. Good experience üëç

It's a small takeaway joint located very close to my house. The food items here come with a very average taste. The chicken lollipop is worth the try. It is actually good. The fried rice and noodles are also made well. But I would want them to work on their side dishes and momos. Order some food to satisfy your hunger pangs when you are lazy enough to go out and eat.

This is a small food joint near Naktala Sammilani club.. Though honestly I have never been there, today only I saw them in Swiggy and decided to have SPECIAL MOGHLAI PARATHA.. trust me it's beyond the world.. I can't describe how good their food is.. And their packaging was mind blowing..
The quantity is enough for 2 if you are having dinner.. And for snacks it's good enough for 3-4 hungry souls.. TRY THEM GUYS.. THEY WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.

Placed order for home delivery. They fetched us our order within less than an hour. There was a Chinese Veg combo meal and  chicken fried momos . The momos were okay but they should also be providing ketchup with it. The chinese meal was good enough. Veg manchurian was nicely made in spicy thick gravy. However I would like to request them to update their menu in Zomato because when I got the bill I saw the prices were higher than the quoted ones in menu.

I don't know where this place exactly is and frankly speaking, I don't need to. Swiggy is there to deliver the food at my doorstep. Anyhoo, I have ordered chicken manchurian and chicken Hakka noodles (half) the other day. I was surprised to see the amount of food they delivered. The half plate of chicken noodles is good enough for two people. And for the price, I guess that's something you don't expect generally.

Now the quality part. Well, the food was kinda okayish. I felt the chicken manchurian could have been little tastier. But you cannot expect too much at this price range. Also, please make the food less oily. If you keep using that much oil, I'm worried the American army may invade the food, in case the micro-organisms in it need liberation. :v

Ordered their fried rice, chilli fish and fish finger combo via swiggy. This is the cheapest combo offers i have come across. Taste was okay and quantity is more than enough. Fish fingers were good , chilli fish could have been better, fried rice was average. Overall decent in terms of price, quantity and taste. Nothing fancy.

I've only over ordered in from here, and I'll very gladly do it again soon. Their pricing is what makes them especially attractive, not to mention that their food is very decent. 

I've only ever ordered in momos to a friend's place in Naktala, and I've never had complaints. Zero issues, and zero hassles. Their service is prompt and I'm looking forward to the next time I'm famished, only to remember that Flavours is always a phonecall away.

Found this new place on swiggy and decided to try.
Ordered standard safe stuff..
Steamed and fried momos and one chicken chow

The momos were fresh and good sized. The stuffing was decent and was chicken...not full of onion and cabbage but they were very dry.

The chow was very disappointing though.. No flavor. Wasn't tossed well just chunks of chicken and boiled noodles with salt.

Need to do a better job on staples..

We ordered mainly Chinese - sweet & sour chicken, chili mushroom, mixed gravy noodles & egg pakoda.¬†

Although the chicken side dish was okay, but the chili mushroom was bad. The mushroom were not fresh & smelling. The dish was too spicy to be eaten. The taste was totally flat. Now let's come to the other items. Mixed gravy noodles was disaster. You can easily find tastier gravy noodles from small road side joints. The gravy noodles was simply yuck and was a total waste of money. Egg pakora was recommended by a friend. It was another debacle. Lacked taste and was too oily and tough to chew.

Our expectations were simply ruined by such horrible food. At-least we would never order from them again.

Taste wise crispy chicken was good and decent, rice had chicken and shrimp which was too salty and the most sad part was the schezwan chicken gravy since it was sweet lacking capsicum and red papparica(kachalonka) with north indian smell.. i couldn't eat the gravy not even the whole rice.. I wish they get a good chef since there are competitors who servea better food at this price.. like Zaikebaaz.

Placed an order from Swiggy and instantly I realized that I missed other items too. Couldn't place another item as the delivery executives in the vicinity were busy and so decided to place an order through Zomato itself. They cancelled that order stating that it's almost closing time but they were still online. The order placed was simple and sweet. Now coming to the food which got delivered - Chicken pieces were succulent but they had a thick cornflour outer coating. The gravies were on the spicer side.

What we ordered - Schezwan Chicken, Chili Chicken Gravy

DELIVERY TIME - 4/5¬†(credit goes to the Swiggy delivery executive)
FOOD QUALITY - 2.5/5
QUANTITY - 3/5
HYGIENE - 2/5

Have ordered quite a few times from this restaurant from a food delivering app. The food they serve is decent quantity wise. Last night had ordered 2 plates of momo. Mixed garlic fried rice and green chili chicken. Momo was very nice but the spicy sauce was too average. Fried rice was kinda soggy. Prawn was hardly there in mixed rice. Now coming to Green chili chicken the name suggests everything about it. I expected it to be something really nice. But to my disappointment it was a paste of green chili fried along with chicken. It was weird. So i just give my rating based on momo and quantity of food because last time orders were equally poor in quality.
Their mughlai parantha is highly recommended. Best thing to have from this outlet.

I got their food delivered at home.

Veg noodles: it was oily. The taste was average. It had some good amount of veggies and they were well fried. 

Chilli chicken: there were 8 pieces in one plate. Taste was good. Not so oily or spicy. 

Veg noodles: this was again laden with too much oil. Taste was good though.

Their price is very economical. Considering the price the food is good.

Had ordered from their outlet through another app. So its delivery depends on the app itself. So can't say much about the restro's delivery system. 

Had ordered pan fried momo,  chicken American chopsue and mixed fried rice. 

Now coming to the details about each dish

Pan fried Momo - its just too good. A plate consists of 6 momos. Good in size too. And filled with enough amount of chicken rather than onions and other vegetables. Momos are fried properly hence had that little crunch feel too.. 

Chicken American chopsue - another fantastic dish. Had enough amount of chicken pieces. And good in both quality and quantity.. 


Mixed fried rice- this is the least testier dish. Although the quality of the rice is good and also is enough in quantity. Still it contains very less amount of chicken and prawn pieces. Otherwise it would be better. And i would definitely give them 4.5 *. 

Love to have more from them in future...

1. Chicken pan fried momos- 6pcs of medium sized momos wok tossed in spicy sauce,tomatoes,garlic. Very spicy in taste but yet very tasty. The filling of momos were generous as well.

2. Chicken pakora- 8pcs of crispy pakoras made with small chicken pieces,garlic,corander & onions. The taste was decent & went well with chilli sauce.

3. Chicken schezwan chow- Had ordered half plate of it but still the quantity was huge even for a half plate & could easily satiate a hunger of a person. The chow had veggiea & generous chicken pieces. They use thick noodles as compared to other food joints. Value for money dish.

4. Dry chilli chicken- 8pcs of pure chicken without any batter made with onions & capsicums. Typical indian style chilli chicken with good amount of soya sauce being used. The chicken pieces were very soft & the onions gave a good crunch to the dish.

This place offers some great tasty dishes & a special goea to their delivery service. Its very systematic & neat. The person who delivers the food has a thorough knowledge of the areas so you would expect your food to reach you on time. Great job flavours üòÅüëå

I so wish I could rate them more than 5. A rating of 5 is actually underrating them. Anyways first 2.5/5 goes for their behaviour.. Any food joint would have said no for a home delivery when called 10-20 mins prior to their official closing time, however when I called Flavours at 10:40 or so to know if it is possible for them to provide home delivery they said 'yes' and was fast enough to deliver the food . Considering the fact that they took the order at that point in time and delivered the food so fast I was worried about the quality and the quantity. That is where they score the rest 2.5 points.. The food was simply delicious . My order was Mixed Manchurian Fried Rice and Chicken with mushroom. They were perfectly cooked. Fried rice was more than enough in quantity as well as the chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy with perfectly prepared mushroom. This food joint is topping my list presently and I have decided to try each and every dish from this joint in future.

P.S. I wish they would come up with Butter Naan and Kulchas in north indian soon.

30.05.16.   After today's experience I had to decrease their rating from 5 to 3.5. I ordered egg noodles, egg rice and chilli chicken from a relative's place.. They were reluctant to try this food joint as it was unknown to them. I persuaded them to order from here depending upon my past experience but they failed me.
Firstly, they were supposed to deliver the food within 30 mins but I got it delivered past an hour.
Secondly, though the noodles were okay, but the rice was not fresh and were sticky which says it was not well prepared.
Thirdly, I was surprised to see that there were only SEVEN chicken pieces in the chilli chicken which mafe it tough for me to distribute equally ... Very bad experience this time.
I hope the management will see to it and would help me increase the rating back to 5

Flavour's ...It surprised me when I tried it's home dishes for the first time. Mouth watering dishes ... an outlet led by Ex Hotel Management Grad. The best thing about this outlet is the kind of hygiene maintained along with the healthy ingredients used. I would like to suggest you to try Chicken Pakora, Momo, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Momo. I am now a regular customer of this outlet. If not again, but at least for once ...YOU MUST GIVE IT A TRY. HOME DELIVERY AVAILABLE

This is in my area. I have tried there once for Chinese food. And I am heavily satisfied with my food. Food quality is really awesome. I have tried with garlic noodles, mixed fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and lemon chicken. For starters I took boneless chicken pakoda and spring chicken. I am heavily satisfied with my food. Both lemon chicken and sweet n sour chicken are awesome. All who are looking for some tasty fast food, can try this one.
