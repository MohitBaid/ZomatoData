service was superb, something that got highlighted in the entire visit :P
The food was good, we had pretty usual stuff, some baby corn, fried rice, naan, a chicken tikka butter masala, some drinks. Um the smoky whisky sour could‚Äôve been better, else ambience and all were nice!

This place is situated just opposite of RDB building. We have tried normal foods and cocktails here. The quantity and quality of the foods are not so good. Decoration is tempting and the staffs are good. We have tried ristotto and squid here. This place is famous for seafood.

Starters are plenty in numbers...the sea food is quite good, especially the jumbo prawns,,,, Crispy chilli baby corn and Cocktail Prawn were special delicacies and a delight to the taste buds. The Main course was reasonably good, mutton curry was ok. Delivery Service was a bit on the slower side.

Pathetic service!! Starters were good. But the main course and desserts in the buffet were almst empty and do not deserve any special memtion at all..starters were being served in long intervals which made all of us even more impatient..overall it deserves to be rated as the poorest.

First of all, the ambience is terrific. No complaints regarding that. Service is also pretty good, which is expected from a grand establishment such as this. However, the variety in food is a bit lacking. The food itself is pretty good though, but for a place calling itself Ocean grill, it didn't even have grilled prawns in the starters menu. So...u get the gist. Otherwise great.

Had der been 0 stars would have given that.
Dropped down today for buffet lunch..
They said add on 200 we would get duck confeti and turkey..
We were served some cold hard starters ...yaaak is all i can say..
The tandoor chicken served in the tadoor/skewers were dusty and unhyeginic..
Den dey served the turkey and duck which was of the same sauce and they themselves failed to explain..
Coming to main course being a sea food restaurant when i went through the menu most of them were empty and the staff were least bothered to fill..
When i took some crabs dey were black and stale...like common you want to send ur customers to hospital...
Finally came the manager he tried to teach me about crabs....and his behaviour is rude and arrogant.. like why d hell is he in the hospitality sector...
Spoilt the saturday lunch..after i left the restaurant i puked ....
Worst food ever had...
Never to visit again...

The following review concerns only the bouffet system of this themed restaurant. Ocean grill is typical of limited sea foods! I enjoyed only the starters. They have a provision of soft drink only once. No salad in their bouffet menu and main course is limited. There was only watermelon in their fruit salad... Good number of desserts but only few are delicious. Background music is quite boring and as it is a grill room restaurant the service is slow and an extended affair. I am not much happy with their bouffet system because they charge you a lot and food does not reach that level!

Visited the place on Christmas Eve for trying their so called special "Winter Buffet" for the lunch and got to hear that it is available only for dinner service which was previously no where mentioned in their promotional advertisement;  though we decided to stay and their buffet course.
Now coming on to starters we we're served just some pieces of dishes out of which prawn cocktail is the only dish that satisfied the palate, so I requested them to repeat the dish  which to utter dismay was never repeated even after asking for 3 times.
To say about main course various items which were previously available were not there. At one time we were notified that if we add on extra 200 bucks over the buffet price we could avail the roasted turkey and confit duck dishes to which we agreed but about half an hour we were informed that they could not do that. The staff were confused among themselves what was available and what not. Only the seafood pescatora and chilly crab were too good.
The only thing for which I have rated this place 3 is for their dessert section. It is really too good. Baked Alaska was really delicious so as the Triple Pudding.
Overall this place is worth visiting for one time only.@

A must visit place for sea food lovers..
Ambiance: 
Nicely decorated with lots of aquarium and exotic fishes. Pretty good and spacious with provision for team parties and engagement.

Food: 
In spite of decent menu and wide variety of food choices, the taste needs to be looked into. Its good but still a lot can be done. Exotic dishes like squid and octopus is served but the price is exorbitant compared to taste. 

Overall I would say if budget is not a constant and you want to taste something new visit there.

Didn't like the food at all. Maybe it's a 24 th December night so the quality dipped a bit, but overall didn't like the food. 

But yes, desserts were pretty good, so üëç to that Chef who did a pretty good job at making desserts. 

Price wise : Food - A bit on the higher side. ( Quality vs Price ) 
                     Bar - Very expensive. ( Ambiance vs Drinks )

Advice to management : Do a recheck on pric e points. Also, how are you charging GST on Bar menu ? Well till now after gst rollout I havennt been to a place where they charge you tax on alcohol!

The kebabs were dry and small. The buffet wasn't up to the mark. The service was late with waiters being asked to clean the table when the soil plates were in front of us for way too long. Not happy. We know the owners and this has never happened before. They weren't there for personal feedback, hence this review. Hope you get back the same quality you maintained till a few months back.

Had team dinner here. Heard a lot about the place. So finaly decided to visit just to be disappointed to hell. All the starters were smelly, half cooked and tasteless. Specialy veg preparations. Comparing few of the main dishes were better. Desert was good taste wise. But what annoyed me the most is this a service guy who was very rude. Not atall expected from a brand name like this.

STORY OF A BROKEN HEART (read shattered tummy as well)...!

My first visit to this restaurant was on 11th Nov, 17 with my BF.

It was not a good experience with the presentations & ambience etc.

Since the food was good so I thought to pay another visit.

This time 6 of us had a booking on SUNDAY 10th Dec,17 for a Lunch Buffet.

The first thing to be noticed is the reception..!

There was nobody to welcome apart from the security guard at the door.

We have been served welcome drink ‚Äì lemonade, it was fresh.

Then they have placed the live grill on table ‚Äì it looked like a piece of junk ‚Äì rusted , dirty..!

You‚Äôll loose the urge to have the starters immediately after looking at it..

They‚Äôve served 3 Kebabs - Chicken Reshmi & Tandoori, Fish, Mutton. 

Reshmi Kebab & Mutton ‚Äì was good but not juicy as we‚Äôve had last time.

Tandoori Chicken & Fish Kebab ‚Äì was good.

They had Prawn Cocktail which I find quite good..

However, from my 1st experience I‚Äôve requested to make the Crab a bit Smoky.

They said they don‚Äôt serve the crab in starters & it‚Äôs in main course.

Now here comes the floor manager ‚Äì i missed to take his name.

With his GREAT DISGUSTING ATTITUDE he said same thing.

Also, he added ‚Äì humlog smoked crab buffet mein serve nehi karte , aap galat bol rahe h...‚Äù

I said I understand the same but since you have a tandoor right & can‚Äôt you modify the same a bit for us ‚Äì he immediately refused with the same rude attitude.

However, I said ok fine, may be I‚Äôm getting confused (though i wasn‚Äôt as the gap of visit was only a month).

Then also, the person who was serving kept murmuring..

There were six of us & they were serving 2 skewers which has 6pcs of kebabs with a gap of 10mins..!!

We had to request them to fill it in every time..!

Even there were times when 6 of us just sitting with empty plates..!

Some of the chicken wings were tasted like leather instead a juicy one & I can bet it wasn‚Äôt fresh..!

The crispy fried corns were soggy & cold...

Mourola Fish fry ‚Äì was over fried, instead of being crispy it was chewy..!

Then comes the main course ‚Äì A COLD BUFFET IN A RAINY COLD AFTERNOON was their theme..!

Entire food was cold..!

Pasta, Pulav was overcooked, Chicken in Mushroom Sauce was hard, Clams in Seafood Curry tasted horrible..!

The crab curry was too watery..

We have somehow managed to eat some of Biryani which was cold too..

Desert ‚Äì it was ok & not to mention any speciality in that section.

I had a very bad experience with the person who was serving us ‚Äì his shirt was not buttoned properly, it was dull & dirty.

The way he was talking while serving I can say that he definitely doesn‚Äôt know how to serve food..!

If this would‚Äôve been a road side DHABA I wouldn‚Äôt have mention the above..

& all the above have happened in an empty restaurant on a SUNDAY Lunch having 15-20 people on total in Buffet...!   

My request is to the restaurant authority ‚Äì you try switching off the buffet & focus on ala-carte only..!

I wish I could give a minus to this but it‚Äôs not here.

Standing opposite to the most famous BBQ Nation ‚Äì you are digging your own grave towards disappointment...! 

LAST NOTE: if making food is an Art then serving the same it‚Äôs an exhibition in which it has to be perfect to the 'T'..

A complementary cake and drinks served by them. The manager personally attain us for service. The staffs and their behavior is amazing. One thing is it took a bit time to serve. Otherwise it's perfectly fine. So, if you visit take time in your hand and enjoy the seafoods. Would love to visit again. Here is a picture of their warm greetings.

It is located opposite BBQ Nation at sector 5, Salt lake. Since we wanted to have sea food in our buffet spread we selected this restaurant. Their interior is nice...there was a complementary drink, and 6 non veg and 6 veg starters. The North Indian starters were good...I did not like their Chinese starters...in the main course their main attraction was crab. Other than that they had pork, chicken, muttton Biriyani,herb rice, mustard fish, soup etc. We expected prawn cocktail and a muttton preparation, but they disappointed us by not providing that. The mutton in the starter was also not good. But they stole the show by providing excellent dessert..baked alaska simply stands out.

When was the last time you did something for the first time? I had mussels for the first time and I loved it. Got the OG's Seafood Platter, which had mussels, squid, octopus, crab, and prawn. They served it with herb rice and garlic bread, which made it a meal on it's own. Three words, ample, tasty, and beautiful. They plated the dish so beautifully that we got more than a few instagram-worthy shots. This was my second visit to Ocean Grill and I must say they have improved in all departments. They not only keep a stock of all the rare items such as salmon and mussels but they have also revamped the decor. As good as the mussels were, I must say the highlight was their extremely courteous behavior. Right from the guard outside to the manager everyone put in that effort to make us feel welcome. Definitely visiting again.

We were specifically craving for seafood and looked at menus to zero in on this place. Reason being they had mussels, something we never had before. We knew what we wanted from the menu on Zomato and we ordered exactly that. Seafood platter. And it was a treat what arrived!! Wow. The staff was very welcoming. The food was delicious and an experience with flying crab parts while we tackled 2 massive platters. Definitely going back!!

Most pathetic restaurant i hv visited in terms of buffet in recent times. Only few items were thr as Starters & were served in very less quantity & very slow,cold.  It took ages for them to bring one type of starters for 2nd round. Moving on, nothing special in main course except for Fish Paturi. Worst- their waiters,  wonder are they even trained at all? One waiter was most likely intoxicated while asking me about something & i had to reply 3 damn times loudly before he could understand in his state! Another waiter stared at our table thoughout the time we were thr & made the whole ladies group very uncomfortable, no basic coursey. Not worth your money. I totally regret not going to barbeeque nation right opposite to this one, & trying for something new! Don't go there!

Staff were very prompt and courteous. Full marks for this place. One of my favorite restaurant. Would definitely go for candle light dinner with my loved one at Ocean Grill.

Complete wastage of money.Non veg buffet cost is way too high, 896 per person,but the taste of food is horrible. Chicken wings , prawn and crispy chilly babycorn tasted same!!! Just too salty. Main course was equally bad. For crab, they were serving only the  legs and that too were small in size. Biriyani was horrible. Dessert spread was equally unimpressive. Never ever try lunch buffet here.

Although we had choices for buffet, but we didn't feel for it. Instead, tried some ala carte recipes with prawns & chicken. Chicken Alakiev was ordered. It was alright for me since I had tasted it for the first time . Unfortunately late service messed it up. Wasnt a good experience.

Baked Alaska is love.. Well I'm a sweet tooth so I really have a soft spot for places who get me good desserts after a good meal.. I visited Ocean Grill long back..with live music and all the office colleagues it was certainly a party.. Prawn Cocktail is one hell of a starter.. I personally loved it. And that thing about buffets, you just can't get over with the main course. Same goes here.. Awesome starters, fine desserts,  the main course was just good... It can be considered..

I have been to Ocean Grill once and I would love to go there over and over again. We tried the Caesar salad, lamb steak and fish n chips. The lamb was tender and juicy, and the fish was extremely delectable and would melt in one‚Äôs mouth. The ambience was wonderful with spacious and cosy sitting arrangement. The staff were friendly and prompt. In fact since we tried the al a carte, the manager served us complementary desserts from their lavish buffet. It‚Äôs definitely worth visiting.

The ambience is really nice.The buffet offers a wide variety of delicacies and you can enjoy that with some live music which heightens the overall experience. Best place to go if you love sea food.

I have been to here for quite a few times but this time my experience was horrible. priviously the have quite a big spread for the buffet with prawn crab etc but today I am really disappointed in starter s they served only prawn cocktail with very small prawns and other than this all starters are very avarage.
The main course is really disappointing they have 3 types of rices but all are not cooked well they are very hard taste horrible. 
only deserts are ok.
staff behaviour is good.  
I have very good experience with ocean grill priviously but today it all just faded.

Probably one of the best places offering you delicious sea food in Kolkata. The platter that we ordered had almost all common sea food items that was known to me but hadn't had the chance to taste yet. Thanks to Ocean's link I found Octopus, lobster, Crabs, Shells, Prawns, Squids and a few varieties of fishes served in the same platter!

However, ordered a fish of Crab in Cheese Garlic butter sauce which turned out to be a big disappointment!

Went there quite a while back. They have a very unique buffet menu emphasizing on sea food as the name suggests 'Ocean Grill'.
The buffet spread was delightful with mouth watering starters and wonderful desserts at the end.
The main course had biryani and items of prawns, crabs,fish and chicken as well.
They also have a good drinks menu.
Service was excellent.
A great place to have a lunch.

Visited on Maha Ashtami,and the lunch was no less than a Maha-one. The staff were fully cooperative and attentive even during the rush hours. Coming to food,the buffet was definitely overpriced. But the quality is worth praising. The buffet consisted of Bengali/Chinese/Mughal dishes and I was amazed as to how we loved all together on the same plate.

This restaurant is situated in a building right opposite RDB Cinemas...The ambience is very cosy with blue tinged dim lights to give it a marine feel....They will switch on more lights if asked for it....The place totally justifies it's name with interiors portraying oceanic lives....You can also get to see a unique collection of fish and other aquatic organisms in their aquariums....

We visited this place for dinner on Maha Asthami and thus it was absolutely crowded....But despite that the service was quite quick and the quality of food was also maintained....

Now coming to the food....we opted for √† la carte and ordered the following:
1) Mixed Seafood & Chicken Lung Fung Soup- It was a thick soup full of all kinds of seafood,eggs and chicken....
2) Fish & Chips - It tasted somewhat blunt....but with the dips it tasted fine....
3) Ocean Grill's Special Spaghetti Pasta - It was a little spicy and contained prawn,squid,octopus and many such marine organisms....

So basically seafood lovers must try this place atleast once....

And yes the Kolkata traffic just adds on. They gave reasons that they will loose 8people on waiting for us. Well we made a call to the store around 10 days back.The hospitality industry runs on pleasant manners not on rude and arrogance of the staff. It's bull shit .please m requesting every one please. Whatever happens no matter whatsoever, please never go to this place.

This restaurant is in Infinity Benchmark building on 1st Floor, a prime location in sector V. Last week I was there for a office party. Starters were really good but the service is pathetic. There is sitting arrangement for about 70 people but the stuffs are really lazy to serve food and dishes as per your demand. We had to wait a long before we could get the dish we ordered. Main course is so so.. nothing special about that. Deserts are standard. Wish they could serve better so that we could enjoy the starters a bit more.

Went for the first time, this place is located in sec 5 beside RDB cinemas. We went during lunch hours and had buffet. The served many things for the starters which included baby corn, chicken and fish kebabs, paneer kebabs, and many more items, the starters were decent . For the main course , we had to select from a large variety of food and cuisines. The main course was not as tasty as expected. For the desserts we had several kinds of pastries, gulab jamun and ice cream. The price for two here is somewhere around 1500/-. They can improve their food quality as per the price . The staffs were polite in nature.

It's true that we went to ocean grill because we didn't get place at barbeque nation but the experience didn't let us down. At the entry, the 3D flooring amazed us and the interior was very nice ( I liked the tiny üê¢ and the fish in aquarium). The quality of buffet was pretty good. The kababs were very good I gorged on the fish kabab, though I didn't like the taste of the prawn cocktail much. I found the Fried anchovies a little bit salty. In the main course mutton biryani was good, I really liked fish in white sauce, pork vindaloo. It was so tasty. Don't try the herb rice and chicken with mushrooms, both of them were stale I guess. Fish salad was very good. In dessert, I became a fan of baked Alaska, don't forget to try it, the caramel castard was very good too. Other sweet dishes were good too. Last but not the list, the live singing accompanied our dinner in a very good way.

One sentence- " boss,if you dont get reservation in BBQ Nation, go home and have dal chawal but ,dont try this place as a alternative ,this place is like wada pow next to a ham burger BBQ "

So as said above tried this place as a alternative to BBQ on a busy sunday evening.
The place is just opposite to RDB and is one the 1st floor.
I went there with a Little App promotion coupon code.
I was given a corner table which was very dark.
The service is very slow and due to the low lighting you can't really enjoy your food.The place has that gloomy dull look..not at all vibrant ...makes your mood a sad one.
The straters were served on the table was so so.
Main course had a lot of items but none standout.The mutton was well cooked .
The desert was also so so.
So if you want good buffet within 800.in sec-5.. My choice will be Chaibreak ,then BBQ and then even if you don't get a seat...try Ocean Grill.

We walked into this much talked about restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and the gift we received from them...will be timeless. 

We walked in and sat at a table. While they asked us about our choice of buffet or ala carte, we informed them that we had a nearby coupon for the lunch. But we were informed we could not avail it because of 15th August. 

This cooked up a storm, which in all these years of our visits to the restaurants of Kolkata has never blown us up. Soon started the drama of the Millennium. 

He welcomed us to their buffet and it was a marvelous spread of a horrifying experience. For the starters he served us absolutely raw discourtesy. Moving on to the main course, he proudly served us more impertinence and second rate hospitality. For the desserts we were served with immense respect and kindness by the executive chef, Shane. 

However all the indigestion courtesy Mr Manager was beyond endurance. In regards to the kind of impoliteness and indifference served here, it doesn't even deserve the single star given to it. 

Special Mention: Please dispose off your self respect before you step in here. Better if you sell it off when the manager comes for an interaction!!

There is nothing unusual about this restaurant. We went in for a non veg buffet on a Saturday. The starters we're not upto the mark. The prawn cocktail is just a few prawns in a glass of mayonnaise with cabbage n onion. Placing a grill on the table from where you can take the kababs is not interesting unless the kababs are delicious. Fish kabab was crap and the chicken was better to some extent. Moving on to main course, the mutton biryani was too much scented, without any taste. The chicken, pork or the seafood neither of them was commendable. The crab was somewhat better than the rest. Moving on to dessert, this was the best section. Lots of options and all of them were good. 

Last word: Not value for money as better options are available around.

We had a booking for 40 heads for a dinner buffet this evening....had quite a disappointing experience. It was raining heavily when we reached the area and could not find a place to park, so I called up and asked if they have any parking zone. The person who picked up (after 8-10 rings) said he did not know and that we were supposed to find on our own !!!! So much so for courtesy !

The starters were poor in taste, the chicken wings being half cooked, the fish items relatively better. The main course was also poor not in terms of variety ( the spread was quite something) but the items were not tasteful.

The place is so congested that it is very difficult to help yourself. They do not keep fresh spoons or forks with the main course ! You are supposed to use the same ones that you had earlier used in the starter plate !

The dessert was however, excellent , that being the saving grace, the spread was lavish, and each item was tasteful.

This restaurant is located on the first floor of infinity benchmark , right opposite RDB cinemas, and is a stone's throw away from 10 Downing Street. The interiors have a dominant shade of blue , but there are seats overlooking the street outside , so you don't get the blues . The service here is attentive , though their bartending needs considerable improvement. Some of the items on the drinks menu were unavailable.The Tequila Sunrise they make has anything but tequila, and their Mind Eraser can be erased from your mind as soon as you've had a taste of it. The food , however , is quite a draw here , and the non veg buffet menu has everything from fish to chicken, mutton, lamb, mussels , crabs, prawn . The prawn cocktail is served along with the starters. The veg starters include baby corn and paneer , and the kebabs are warmed in a grille right in front of your eyes , on the table ! The main course also has rice items like pulao and biryani. The desserts here have a string of sweet somethings , that will leave you spoilt for choice ! The starters are served by the staff , but the main course needs self service , as is the case in most buffet restaurants. The taste of the food items on the menu , however , is nothing to write home about , though they do make up for it in variety! Overall , a good place to try out some non veg dishes , especially the seafood including crabs and mussels, that are not served for buffet in most restaurants.

Food quality is pathetic. They served mutton steak, which was not fresh & smelling bad. Though they have not charged for it. Later we have ordered for sea food platter, again disappointment as fish, prawn & squids are not at at all fresh. Bad experience ..

Couple of days back I paid a visit to this place for lunch with my sister. The first thing that drew my attention was the ambience and underwater creature themed interior. The staffs are well trained and showed perfect hospitality. We opted out for buffet and there were a good no of dishes from starter to main course to dessert. We found it hard to say which one tasted the best. Enjoyed their buffet and will surely go back to try out their ala carte soon.

It was the first time outing for me here at ocean grill. And we opted for buffet ala cart√©.

Well as per looks are concerned with I will give 4.0/5, cause an individual would definitely feel that he or she is probably sitting in deep down of an ocean. Consisting of a lot of aquariums, hence ocean grill name properly justifies itself.

Now coming to the food, starters were decent, one will definately like boneless chicken, sweet baby crispy corn and mutton seekh kabab. I felt prawns were horrible. It was under prepared. In main course one will certainly love Afghani murgh and mutton biryani. One will certainly get a lot of varieties in main courses and starters, while considering sea-food. Most disheartening part was desert, There was no ice creams. So concluding everything certainly there were many options but none of them were outstanding.
Food: 3.5/5

Services were good although
Services: 4/5

But considering all the facts, one of the best grill food outlet in Kolkata

The two of us ended up spending 3200 in two hours but the food was absolutely worth it! We ordered for the seafood platter (with lobster), chargrilled octopus, squids in lemon-butter-herbs sauce and tiramisu. The tiramisu was deeply disappointing but the octopus and squids were complete delights. The platter which came with an enormous lobster, octopus, squids, mussels, prawns, crabs and grilled basa had mostly highs and some lows: the lows, for us, were the crabs and the lobster. The seafood comes with dips and sides of garlic bread, fried rice, mashed potatoes and/or saut√©ed vegetables. The service is rather good and we realised that most of the servers were more comfortable with Bangla and that was on with us. Will I go back there again? Yes, definitely for the octopus. I wish it were not located so out of the way for me though!

Buffet Spread is decent.. good tasty items.. but nothing out of the blue .. very less items to justify the name ..

BUT.. if u really want to try out the place.. i would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the A La Carte... too good.. it brings out the name of the Restaurant.. huge variety.. lovely taste.. definitely worth a try.. might pinch ur pocket a little.. but worth it !!

Conveniently situated in Infinity Benchmark, just opposite to RDB.

The ambience goes all with the name. Many aquariums and walls full with decor fishes. The buffet is placed above a brown ship shaped structure. The decor and ambience gives justice to the name, Ocean Grill. 

The Non Veg Skewers were definitely mind-blowing, especially the Prawns and Fish.
Give a try to Vegetarian ones as well viz. Mushroom and Chilly Corn Skewers.
Not to mention, I get all immersed in the Starters, that I actually forget that Main Course awaits !!

I had a little space for Main Course, and nothing great to mention.

The Dessert section had an assortment of Pastries, Ice Cream, Brownie and Gulab Jamuns.

I have to acknowledge, the staff here, for they were the perfect ingredients to the making of the whole experience being very courteous, asking our opinion on the quality of the food, trying to understand our taste buds.

In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Moreover, you do get coupons easily towards this restaurant. Recommended !!

I am rateing it 3.5 because of a single tipical reason. Ill be comeing to that but before anything i would say the ambience was really beautiful. The food was good not excellent. The diversity of food is so so. It could have been improved. The peculiar thing is they are charging 18%GST as per tax law.. but i feel wrongfully they are also charging 7% on the bill before applying GST. They could have just increased the buffet rate. So my review will be 1 time vist is perfect.

When the type of the service it offers matches with a restaurant just opposite to its location unfortunately there will always be comparison. The variety of food in its buffet menu is good, comparable with BBQ Nations. Quality is satisfactory. Service fine. Ambience good. Mostly I have good experience here, never regretted for not going to the restaurant. But still not as good experience as BBQ Nations.

The worst restaurant of Kolkata.. We ordered buffet.  They provide the stater very slowly. Service was very bad. They did not provide sufficient amount of stater. Due to the slow serving we just told them please serve us main course.  Main course is even horrible than stater. Food was cold and tasteless. Then comes the desert it was bad. For the first time in my life I like only rice and dal in a restaurant.  Price is same as barbecue Nation but if I compare between this restaurant and barbecue nation. It is not 1% of that. My suggestion. Please don't go to that restaurant. Better eat the street raw food.  Raw food is more tastier than this. I want to give - very rating but it is not allowed here.

Went for a dinner there last night with my Mom and Dad. Had a really lovely time. Ordered chicken  ceaser salad, fish bucket, baby lobster & lamb steak. Apart from the lobster everything was really perfect.  Especially the fish bucket was heavenly.

We were served by Mr. Sovon who was quite hospitable and gave us wonderful suggestions.

However you guys have to look into the house keeping. This area needs vast improvement. The buffet counter was quite unclean. For that reason we ordered a la carte.

Everything else was thumbs up. A definite come back point.

We tried the dinner buffet on a Thursday night. The ambience was great and the food was also delicious. The live music was awesome too. The maincourse had many options which is rare for restaurants in Kolkata. The Singaporean Chilly Crabs though didn't seem fresh to us (a bit smelly). Since we were 9, they offered us a discount too. Overall, it was a great experience.

Went to celebrate my parents marriage anniversary on last Sunday. We had a plan to enjoy India's batting in this delicious food corner. Though rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan disappointed us but the starter of ocean grill is not. At first they offered soft drinks. We have taken 7up as a complimentary drinks.There are huge number of starter like chicken-mutton- fish- panir kababs, yummy chicken wings, prawn cocktail, baby corn etc. You can catch a large number of fish items in this ocean. They arranged vanilla cake to celebrate the occasion.
As the 3 corner TV bringing sad news that kohli, yuvi, dhoni are out and so middle order breaks down, we started our main course. There are so many sea food including crabs, oyster. There are mutton biriyani, fish in creamy mustard sauce, roasted chicken, afgani murgh, mixed sea food pescatora, Singapore chilli crab, chicken salad, Noddles and so many 
 dishes. But I don't like the cooking. They smells like raw as they boiled instead of fried.
After losing all the hope to win India when pandya is wining our heart, we are going towards deserts with the hope that ice cream will melt our heart. But there are few desert like hot gulab gamun, baked Alaska, cake etc. We don't find ice cream in any corner. It highly disappointed us as jadeja didn't sacrifice his wicket to save pandya. As a result pandya run out. But  staff of ocean grill arranged ice cream as we complained about it.
Though number of deserts, and cooking of food failed to fulfil our expectation , the beautiful ambience, hospitality of staffs and huge starter and main course stolen our heart.

It's located on infinity benchmark building, just opposite to RDB. I went there today with my family. As it's a weekday, the restaurant was full empty. The ambience is awesome. The decoration goes with the name. There are lot of aqauriums inside the restaurant. The walls are full of the designs of fishes. They put the food items for buffet above a ship shaped furniture. You will fall in love with the decoration. There is a small bar type area, attached with the restaurant. We asked for buffet menu. The staffs are very formal. At first they asked us about the choice of complementary drinks which includes various soft drinks and fresh lime soda. Then they served a lot of starters of paneer, prawn, chicken, mutton, baby corn, mushroom. Then we went for main course. The veg section is awesome. All the food items tasted so good. Then we went for non veg section. We expected that there will be seafoods‚Äã. But we were disappointed. There were only crab and a mixed seafood gravy. Though two types of salads and soups, pasta, hakka noodles, steamed rice, daal, mixed veg, chilli paneer, chilli soya, afghani murgh, mutton biriyani, raita will please your tummy. We were so full after the main course. But if you have sweet tooth, there will always be a craving for desserts. The dessert section has lot of pastries, mango mousse, baked alaska, caramel custard, milk cake, cheese cake and gulab jamun. I would suggest you to give it a try.

Nice and cozy. Located at the smack middle of Sector 5, Salt Lake. Me and my wife visited the restaurant to have some quite time. We enjoyed every bit. 

From the perspective of food it was nice. We took the buffet meal. Consists of 6 veg and 6 non veg starters, a lot varitey of main course items and a small set of desserts. Though the focus is on different types of  fishes and sea foods. Which makes the menu quite different from the ones you expect in the likes of barbeque nations or flame nd grills. Especially liked the fish fries in sauce, oysters , prawn cocktails and crabs in Singapore style gravy. The veg items are not that good in comparison. But who will visit the restaurant to have a veg meal.

Other things that I liked are the aquarium adorned decor and noticeable excellent staff behavior. Would recommend the restaurant ti my friends.

Good experience with seafood. Since the place specialises in seafood cuisine it does not disappoint. We ordered fish bucket for appetisers. The fish was cooked perfectly. Although the dish lacked some acidic content.. it could be Integrated in the dips or salad served along side. The sea food platter was what i was looking forward to and it was cooked pretty well.. although i would have liked more quantity of clams and mussels. Overall a very good experience. Quite up to the mark.

Located at Sector V, this place mostly attracts the people working out there. They serve buffet plus ala carte. Was in the neighborhood on a Monday evening. Since the other places were not serving alcohol, went here. They had happy hours for only 1 certain brand of beer, a 1:1 offer on Long Island Peach Tea and 2:1 offer on Sula wines. Opted for the LIT. For appetisers, ordered a fish bucket. The drink was okay, nothing extraordinary. The fish was very soft but again nothing very appealing. Service was little laid back. Decent place but nothing to go gaga about it.

Firstly I thought to have much more sea foods and expected squids / octopus in buffets but got only crab.that too very small starters were good .One pork dish was there kept some awesomeness in it.apart of that everything is quiet ok.
Dessert was not having ice cream... -_-
Also options were less...
More on it Ambiance...
So what we found is flies roaming around... That was quiet unexpected.

Good food with plenty of variety. Enough effort made to match the name given 'Ocean', although according to me could have been better - like the seating surely needs some change since some sections are so close to each other you could barely be able to get your partner. 
Can stop criticising lights - it was all blue, even food menu is also in blue - so net net you are certainly going to get tough time to finalise your menu.

The management were a bit shaky there while serving  the starters. The kebabs were not do tasty. I found them not to be freshly served. They were very hard to chew in. Compltng the starter we went towards the main course and i found them to be again not fredhly cooked. They all looked like a day befores. Only the desert section was worth trying. Each and every dish were dsmn tasty.

Well first of all really sorry for this late review...
Visited the place last month...and was an awesome experience... Mr. Shane (Executive Chef) is an amazing person...he was very tensed as their speciality is sea food mainly non-veg and he had to cook veg for us...so as I had a chit chat with him he said he was very tensed for the food quality..will he be able to put it up to the mark or not...
Let me tell you... seriously...they kept up their reputation...each and every dish we tried was like super amazing.... We had Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Cheese Balls, American Corn, Noodles & Manchurian, White Sauce Pasta..all these were damn delicious... cheese balls and white sauce pasta were like the best I've had till date...they were so delicious I've no words....
Then for main course had Kulcha's, Chola, one Soya Sabz don't remember the name...then rice and two types of Dal...each and every dish was super delicious...
And finally for desserts had Hot Gulab Jamuna, Caramel Custard (which I tried for first time) and it was also delicious...and in the last we got Phirne Chef's Special...he strongly recommend to give it a try...and guys...it made the day...we were all full... weren't willing to have it but as he requested so have it a try...and seriously everyone liked it...!!
Amazing experience... Thanks Mr. Shane..
Overall
Food - Super Delicious
Ambience - Amazing
Service - Friendly and Well Behaved Staff (I can't remember the name but I guess he was Mr. Sovan he was like Super Friendly...)
Would love to visit again sometime..!!

Then also, they forget to give the second serving even after requesting for it, so we had to go for the main course due to time constraints. Food was okay, crab and prawn dish were not so good. Dessert was decent.

I visited Ocean Grill with a friend who had been here before and liked it very much. With underwater decor and dim blue lights, you do get the feeling of having stepped into an aquarium, though it could seem a little too dark to some. We sat on the sofas under a big shark wall hanging. Along with Kingfisher beers, we had a spicy prawn dish recommended by the waiter and a lamb shank, which was technically off the menu but which we got by virtue of my friend knowing the restaurant owner! The prawns were super tasty, served in a spicy sauce with toasted bread for dipping - I only wish there was more of it! The lamb was yummy too, though I thought it had a bit too much fat. I liked the accompanying salad, though. Service was fairly quick. I don't usually come to this area, so I can't say whether I will return, but it's a pretty good option for people seeking a nice non-vegetarian lunch - though the prices are kind of on the steep side!

Nice ambience but it was crowdy. One of the expensive restaurants we tried in Sector 5.I went with my boyfriend as we love trying new restaurants every weekend. We went for the Ocean Grill Buffet which was not a good decision as i feel there were not much variety in the main course section. Though the desserts were amazing. I would suggest u guys to go for Al carte instead of buffet as it would give u an ample amount of options.

Last Saturday, we went to Ocean Grill with our office colleagues. Service of staff were well. Starter menu was awesome. But Main course was not enough options. We chose NON-VEG Buffet (Rs.916 with Tax). There have one complementary chillers for each. Not more option. Only had Soft drink and Lime Water. After that staff served us veg and non-veg starter like American corn, Crispy chili Baby Corn, Crispy Mustard Potato Wedges, Moroccan Spiced Chargrilled Chicken, Prawn Cocktail etc. Then they prepared for kabab on table. Only had 4 kababs (chicken, Mutton tikka, Fish and Paneer). We expected one prawn item either starter or main course, but had no item. Then we went for main dish. There have Lahori Ghost Biriyani, Afghani Murgh, Pork Vindaloo, Tandoori salad, Lemon Rice, Hakka veg noodles, Fruits salad etc. Deserts were very tasteful. Unfortunately, they could not accept our Debit card due to their machine problem. So, we must pay by cash.

Who says it bad?
The very first step I took into the restaurant I was astounded by the aquariums, the big glass window around the wall and colourful interior. 
Next we started with the non veg buffet. Every starter was too notch. But the prawn cocktail deserves my special mention. In the main dish pork and chicken dishes was so much salivating. But my stomach needed much space after 10 rounds of prawn cocktail to accommodate that. So I jumped to desserts. We ordered baked Alaska. It was also tremendously tasty. We promised a second visit whenever we come back to salt lake again. :)

Menu is simply awsum having staters consisting a perfect blend of mouth watering continental dishes and kababs.

"Horrible food" can be the only word comes to my mind to describe the taste. 
On a Wednesday night, my cousin threw a dinner here as Barbeque Nation was full. Inspite of the fact, I have never received a positive review for this place, opted to have dinner buffet just for the sake of my cousin. 
We were served with some crispy brinjal preparation, sweet corn (which initially seemed to be a carbon copy of what Barbeque Nation provides as per it's appearance but It's NOT), chicken tikka, mutton kebab and sime shrimp diece as starter. We had to call the waiter at least 4 to 5 times to get a single plate of mutton. 
In the main course  I only liked the herb rice and crab curry preparation. 
Will never ever go to that place.

A spacious restaurant with minimalist chic decor. A very good ambience to relax and catch up with friends and colleagues.

The buffet spread has a choice selection with a variety of desserts on offer. Entr√© are served at the table and are quite interesting. The preparations for main course taste fresh, light and healthy. Personally I prefer it to over the top spicy.

Staff are courteous and service is good. Overall a good place to hang out comfortably and walk out happy.

Pro tip: Avoid the buffet and opt for a-la-carte to get a true taste of what this place has to offer. In case you have just walked across the street because BBQN was full, do not expect a similar experience.

Visited then yesterday afternoon... Was empty but thought to give it a try.

Ambuince is quite to the theme but the furniture is wearing... Showing signs of aging, nothing wrong in that.

Ordered for Nasi Goreng. Took 25 minutes to prepare, look this is not a dish that takes long to prepare.

It's a simple Indonesian version of fried rice with leftover meat or seafood chopping and a fried egg and a few grilled or fried sticky meat chunks. Got the same. Looked awesome.

Major part of the food tasted great except the chicken sides, it was old meat or bad cut. Left it. Rest was good.

Overall like the place, slightly over priced, but expensive Real Estate what can they do... 

Will visit again.

We were at Ocean Grill for dinner last evening. The restaurant is the "go to" place for all sea food lovers. They have a amazing array of mouthwatering dishes, from Sea Bass to Oysters, Crabs, Lobsters, baby Octopus and Squid. The sea food platter is a must have. It gives you a taste of each of the above delicacies. Although it gets a little messy as you have to give up your fork and knives and dig in with your bare hands, it is incredibly satisfying. The platter had two Crabs, one large lobster, and a generous helping of prawns, sea bass, oysters and baby octopus. You could also try the Tuna Salad which is pretty filling and refreshing at the same time. The service is excellent and the staff are absolute indulgent. Yet another aspect that strikes you immediately as you enter the restaurant is its ambience. The places has multiple aquariums with turtles and colourful fishes swimming about. The the most striking feature is the bar with a wall full of liquor bottles and colourful lights that make it the center piece.
Overall we have a wonderful time. We left with a tummy full of sea food and a heart full of memories. Would love to go back soon.

Congratulations! Keep it up guys!

Heard mixed reviews from many friends and went to give a try. Opted for the buffet dinner. The spread was huge. They offered the starters on the table and took awfully long time to serve. Repeat service was even more time taking. The prawns were way too chewy.¬†
So, we moved to the main course even as the starters were being served.¬†
A long list of items each tasting ¬†quite average. The Crabs at the Buffet were tiny sized whereas the ones being served to a la cart connoisseurs were big. Same with the Prawns.
I don't know if it's their policy to distinguish between quality food to A La Cart and Buffet diners.

The worst dining experience in years. Been to this fancy place for dinner with family on Bengali New Year. Misbehaving staff, elusive manager, below- average starters and main course, infinite delay in delivery, lack of coordination while taking orders - the list is long. To add to the 'spicy' experience, we were asked to change table in the middle of dinner as the 6  seater table we sat in suddenly joined a 4 seater and we were told they cannot allow us to sit in there as big parties were waiting up. I decided to play a good samaritan and was readily given another table. So we stood up to head towards that; however the other table already had customers. Then the manager pitched in, didn't utter apologies, pointed us casually to a corner shack where all our dishes and glasses battled for a place and we had to somehow half- finish our 'exquisite' dinner.
Long story short, out of all items in my list of experiences, I would top the staff misbehavior as the star. An oceanic blunder, to have chosen this place to dine in.

The place is situated in the heart of Sector 5, Salt Lake, the Ocean Grill doesn't deliver as expected out of it. The location is prime giving it all the attention it needs, but the experience is not exactly a memorable one. The insides of the place are themed like an underwater odyssey which is a happy change from usual interiors. The food menu is elaborate but not the one that sets the benchmark. Food quality is very good apart from the occasional miscues the team tend to have, especially when the volumes are bigger. Worse thing about the place is the service staff that misbehaves to say the least. Orders placed stay hanging on the ledge until you fight for them. Not really a place to visit in big numbers and more like a place to go for the just-another-day kind of lunch.

We had buffet. The starters were not upto the mark. The chicken kebabs were hard and not tasty. Food was cold. The roast chicken had a funny smell and the afghani chicken was simply yuck! The saving grace was the desserts - though not all the items tasted good. Would definitely not recommend anyone. Oh yes! Besides the four of us, there were only two other diners present in the restaurant.

Well I'm sitting right now in this restaurant and I am so fed up that I am forced to write this review. First of all their ICICI culinary treats offer is valid only on ala carte and not buffet. Secondly some of the starters were really lousy. The paneer was chewy and hard and probably stale. The fish was also hard and chewy and of poor quality. The American corn and salt and pepper anchovies reeked mustard oil smell. Chilli prawns were served instead of the prawn cocktail. Anyways, disappointed as I was with the starters, I moved to the main course in Hope of something better. The chicken and fish salad were still okayish. Other preparations were just very average in taste and quality. The chicken was tough as a rock. My chicken leg was raw in the inside. All the food served in the buffet was atrociously cold. And when I reported this they came up with a lame excuse that it was because the AC was on! I mean come on! Who are you fooling here?! All the buffet restaurants in city are air conditioned only. To make things worse, I went for the veg preparations. My mistake. The dal makhani was oversweet. The soyabean was also hard and chewy. You know what? They should name their restaurant "inedible". When I took a spoonful of veg augratin on my plate, i found a strand of hair in it. EEEWWW! I reported this immediately and thankfully they replaced the dish immediately. Now coming to the desserts. Well I haven't tried them yet and honestly I'm scared to do so after such a horrifying experience. And to think that I have to pay 1700rs for such pathetic food makes me want to bang my head into their aquarium. *Silently crying*

I'm never ever coming back to this restaurant. Plus I will NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone ever. At least for the buffet.

I'm not a seafood eater and i usually place higher weightage on ambience than food. But this place blowed me away. I have rarely had such good food anywhere (and not just seafood).
We tried the buffet. They have got all three - starters, main course and desserts - right. Very rarely do restaurants get all three right. Like I said, I am not into seafood but i loved every preparation (prawns, fish, crabs, etc). And this was the feedback from other ppl on the table also (all bengalis). The desserts are to die for. The profiteroles were the best i ever had.
The ambience might seem a bit tacky but i wouldn't deduct any marks for it. The service is excellent and even on a busy sunday we were given attention.
This street is full of eateries - more glamorous ones even. But i am glad we skipped all these for this place .
Will come back for sure. I don't know why ppl have given it a low rating. But i would've easily given it 5. The only reason i am not giving it 5 is that then you wont believe me.

Ocean Grill serves excellent seafood and the buffet spread here is truly amazing. The starters are superb as are the main course items. Try the desserts also, if you want. I would definitely recommend the a-la-carte menu as well for the variety on offer. Just one thing about the food, the seafood items are much better than the chicken items (especially kebabs). Their service is also excellent and polite. The decor is nice with, as expected, an aquarium and fishnet. Even though it's a bar cum restaurant the ambience inside is family friendly.

This place has been under my wish list for a long time...Went there for a get together with 11 people and the place didn't disappoint

Location: opposite rdb cinemas..In salt lake sector 5
Ambience: Does justice to the name of the restaurant...Number of aquariums having number of small and large fishes and everything including from lighting to sitting arrangement gives an oceanic feeling

Food:we went for the buffet...Starters included chilli baby corn,American corn,chicken wings,grilled fish,chicken and mutton,prawn cocktail..Every item was top notch

Main course items were several and the items which stood out were Singaporean chilli crab,pork vindaloo(though I like to have it a bit more spic),mustard fish,grilled chicken in herbs.

Dessert items too were extremely good ..The good ones being the caramel custard,baked Alaska,chocolate tarts,mousse,brownies...

Overall the quality of main course and dessert was way better than that of BBq nation...And starters were at par with it..
Service: the waiters were extremely well behaved and courteous

Cost::value for money..

Overall a very satisfactory visit...Would definitely have a revisit..The management is doing a fantastic job!!

Staff is quite friendly and helps with the menu selection. We had a long order,so I am not getting into the details.
The food tastes awesome,portion size is good enough and very much value for money.
Must try : Fish basket,chicken irani kebab & chicken sultani kebab..Crispy chilly baby corn for vegetarians.
For mains try Seafood platter,chicken surf & turf, peri peri chicken..Thai curries are a must try..
Be a little patient for the orders takes a little bit of time,but the wait is worth for...

Well if you like sea foods it's a must visit for you. In the buffet you had 2/3 kind of sea foods in main course along with chicken items. Noodles/rice/Nun etc as usual comes under main course. Starters are average. Desert is good. If you don't like sea food much it may not be a best place for you. Else it's good. Service is nice. Ambience is cool.

Located near RDB cinemas, exactly just opposite to it, this is a nice concept place. Staffs are jovial and quite helpful. Went there with a few office colleagues for a lunch buffet.  Sea food is there speciality and their prawn cocktail rocked to the fullest.  Besides all other non veg starters were good.  Main course biriyani is ok.  Pork vindaloo and crab curry are absolutely must try here.  Deserts section needs to be looked at a bit more seriously, this is one thing lacking.

Ocean Grill has to be one of the best recent discoveries in the competitive buffet bazaar of the city.

Being located at the heart of the Bengali Silicon valley, the restaurant has a decent ambience and is easily identifiable.

The interior design and the overall cleanliness of the place is really impressive.

I visited this place yesterday with a handful of acquaintances, thereby ordering bulk amount of food.
Awesome food and very nice ambience and music. Must must try is their sea food. Even liquor is very cheap out here.I would highly recommend this place to everybody. Was with office colleagues in Sector 5 when Zomato suggested me this place.

Went there day before...On a official party...
1. Place is not that spacious. Decor minimalistic. Okayish type.
2. American corn was the first starter, you never ever could masticate the way you do with their stiff dry hard corns. Uffff!
3. Then came chicken wings...Stood 2nd in stiffness that noon! Fried chicken in garlic tomato sauce basically.
4. Complementary drinks came to the table after 45 minutes... Requested a lot....But the waiter got me waiting.... banished and came back before main course!
5. Only silver lining was fish kebab. Asked for a bit more....looked at me as if I made some mistakes Iike a back bencher....! Then the same strategy- got banished!!
6. Terrific biryani- over boiled fragmented rice grains...Spiced up double the normal.
7. I was frustrated by that time and tasted a bit of main course fish and chicken. Unrecognizable taste.
8. With sheer dismay, went for deserts. A small 5 feet arrangement...Tart was good but gulab jamun ordinary. Options were 4-5 only, again minimalism!
... What would you feel... Shall I visit again without any sponsorship? !!!

Horrible food.. the service even worse.. thats how I can summarize my yesterday's experince at Ocean Grill!

Ocean Grill used to be an obvious and regular choice for Team Lunch 4-5 years back.. Then on one visit, they served rotten crabs and raw chicken and we stopped visiting this place. We heard about a change in the management after that.. the backdrops got renovated.. but the chef remains the same.. at least I felt so in my yesterday's visit!

This time we chose Ocean Grill after going through the recent rave reviews in Zomato. While booking for my 40-membered team, I mentioned very clearly to the Amlan, the restaurant manager, that people are quite apprehensive about the food/service at this restaurant and requested him multiple times to take care of the same. We availed the Early Bird Offer to get a 20% discount on the regular lunch buffet price, for which Amlan had requested all of us to enter the place latest by 1pm. We reached within 12.30 pm and occupied 4 of the tables and asked Amlan to provide another small one as there were 4 of our team members on the way. Now starts The Horror Show. He denied to give another table straight on our face, stating that 'we cannot give you all the tables as I have to serve other customers as well'..! Whereas we were the only group present in the restaurant at that point and most importantly, we had the booking for 40-members! After much debate, we were given another small table.

The starters were served. Not from the grill on the table, but from plates. 

Sweet Corn fry: The coating was too hard to be cracked just by human teeth

Crispy chili Babycorn: Was okay, the sauce being way too sweet

Aloo tikka: Strictly okay

Paneer tikka: Smelt of raw spices

Veg puff: Crispy puff with very little filling

Fish kabab (2 varieties, hariyali and kesari): Good

Chicken wings: Tasted good, but the coating was very hard

Chicken tikka kabab: Strictly okay

Salt n Pepper anchovies: Quite a new item for a buffet, tasted great, but a few batches smelt rotten.

Prawn cocktail: Tasted horrible, with just a sweet taste and lacked ANY seasoning.

Mutton seekh kabab: Strictly okay

What we observed that the serving size and techniques completely changed for us from the ones mentioned by Zomato reviewers. Like, the Prawn Cocktails are served in individual shot glasses at Ocean Grill but for us, it was served by a spoon from a big bowl. The mutton seekh kababs were cut in very small pieces.. don't know why.. probably because we were availing the Early Bird Offer!!

The Main Course had quite a good number of items..

Chicken sweet corn soup: Strictly okay

Mutton Biryani: Mutton pieces were soft but the rice was very spicy

Pork Vindaloo: Nowhere a vindaloo preparation, at the most a Pork Kosha.. however, tasted good

Roasted chicken in Mushroom sauce: The chicken was stale

Fish in creamy mustard sauce: Completely bland, just a feeble taste of sweetness, basa pieces were not very fresh as well

Singapore chili crab: Crab pieces were fresh but the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet

Afghani Murgh: Strictly okay

Dhokar Dalna: tasted good, but the dhoka pieces were smaller than a soya nugget

Chilli nuggets: Tasted good

Chef special pasta: Pasta in white sauce, tasted good

Sauteed veggies: Exotic veggies sauteed in butter, probably the only saving grace!

A few other veg items were there in the main course, all of being quite average in taste.

There were a few salads, none of which looked/tasted fresh.

Bengalis are essentially dessert-lovers and people like us wait for the dessert spread in a buffet. To our dismay, the horror story continued here as well-

Fudge Brownie: Rock solid cubes, no hint of moisture

Strawberry mousse: Almost tasteless, devoid of any kind of fluffiness

Baked Alaska: The initial servings went good, but then the whole thing got messed up with only cream leaving behind. No replacement was provided.

Profiteroles: Small moist buns, tasted good

Caramel custard: Probably the worst custard I've tasted in a while

Hot gulab jamuns: Gulab Jamuns which were not even warm, because they said the warmer was not working.

Carrot barfi: Stiff squares of gajar ka halwa, not at all tasty
Chocolate tart: Tasted okay

And the service went to be more and more terrible.. A few of us had asked for a 2nd serving of the fish kababs, the waiters disappeared and came back after we had started off with the main course! Someone went to take the dessert with a mains plate and the waiter snatched the plate from her saying this is not the right plate! ¬†The vegetarian folks were given starter plates of different size and shape to get distinguished easily , but they were repeatedly asked for non-veg starters!

DISAPPOINTED. Not coming back ever.

I have booked table for 20 people for our company team party. First,  decorations are good. Food, they never can compete with Barbecue Nation. Their policy is: take less serve less. You have to ask for more food in buffet starter. They don't even have prawns on grill and they will serve you one stick of mutton. That's it. Food is ok type and main course,  deserts were also ok type. 
Later I packed crab for home and that was raw one of crab of out of three. You can understand how is their services and food will be.
I will never recommend Ocean Grill to anybody.

The food was good however. We had fish and chips(which came in a fish shaped plate owing to their seafood theme),nasi goreng,lemongrass chicken and garlic bread. All the items tasted nice.

Heard a lot that the food quality was not good, but decided to take the risk. I opted for the buffet menu. Went on Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised that we were the only people in the restaurant even though it was almost 2pm.
The decor was pretty nice with a ship shaped table and fish nets, walls with fishes.
Coming to the food, started with hot & sour soup, prawn & squid puff, deep fried baby corns followed with Fish Anchovies which was really an off beat starter but was very tasty. Then came the grill on the table with the Chicken wings, paneer kebab, chicken tikka, chicken reshmi, Fish kebab, mutton seek kebab and finally the Prawn cocktail. All the kebabs were tasty and well cooked. With so much, we were mostly stuffed with little place for main course. Main course was also a nice fare with veg chow and rice, Singapore crab, Pork Vindaloo, Fish in Cheese and Mushroom sauce, herb rice, pasta and 4varieties of salad. Out of this, pork and fish were the stand outs. Finally the dessert, which was quite basic serving fresh fruits, Baked Alaska, assorted cakes, pudding and a choclate coated cream puff. So for 699 it was a very nice deal with so much variety. Will definitely try their ala carte which has a lot to offer also.

Before I write this review, let me confess that I was extremely unwilling to visit this place after hearing so much negative reviews about it. But somehow I made up my mind and thought of giving it a try and was finally here. Some of the rumors were true- Except crab there is hardly any sea food served in their buffet spread. No special items feature in the spread except the prawn mocktail. Kebabs, Biriyani, Pasta etc it is more or less the same old dishes. But no one can complain about the quality or taste of the food. It is pretty good. Can't really comment on how good their service is as the place was pretty much empty when I visited. So if you are looking forward to sea food, please do not go for the buffet. Instead try √Ä la carte.

Being located at the heart of the Bengali Silicon valley, the restaurant has a decent ambience and is easily identifiable.
The interior design and the overall cleanliness of the place is really impressive.

I visited this place yesterday with a handful of acquaintances, thereby ordering bulk amount of food.
Four of us went for the buffet without any hesitation and while the rest preferred A la Carte.
The buffet was identical to that of Barbecue Nation and I faced a really hard time in distinguishing between the two!
As expected, the long list of appetizers filled up our stomachs, even before proceeding to the entr√©es.
For the appetizers, there were meat and veggie skewers, chicken wings, sweet corn, veg pop and other stuff and the list for the main course was endless.
The food was perfectly cooked, without any flaws whatsoever and the service, staff behavior and courtesy too was topnotch.
Apart from the buffet, we ordered the Lamb Tandoori Kebab, couple of Pinacoladas, Pink Lady cocktails and Screwdriver, Fish Soup, Fish Basket and one seafood sizzler.

Voluntarily omitting the entr√©es, I straightaway went for the desserts, which were simply fabulous.
The baked Alaska, caramel custard, fruit salad, profiteroles, gulab jamun and lime sorbet was a sheer nirvana for me and I ended up licking my plates robustly.

All in all, Ocean Grill is a brilliant eating joint for buffets and family get together(s) and I strongly recommend this place to every foodie in the culinary circuit.

Ordered Mongolian chilli fish with rice and Thai chicken curry with rice. They say its a cmplete dish with rice bt bliv me they div only 2 to 3 piece of chkn or fish with small cup of rice. This dish is not at all sufficient for 1 person and you hav to order for more rice which we had to. A trick by them making people order more. The taste is not even good rather towards bland. Did not try their Indian dishes though. Ambience is good though. Price towards higher side compared to taste of food. Not very great food. Seems this place is overhyped. Anytime no comparision with Barbeque Nations.

The menu spread is only good for aesthetics but not worth much more. The ambience leaves you with a severe headache with its over indulgence in ocean theme. No Hygiene, Bad Taste, Poor display and branding.



I was visiting Kolkata during the puja and decided to visit the restaurant as it seemed like a good place however when I visited I had the most horrible experience of my life. Food is tasteless and insipid. The staffs are untrained and lack basic etiquette expected of restaurant staff. The owner was busy entertaining some of his friends (one was actually drunk and behaving shamelessly) and did not seem to be interested in the business.



Hygiene is questionable as I ended up having a severe case of food poisoning.

Defintely a no go if your with family and when you consider the price you pay. More like a roadside bar then a fine dining rest

Visited this place with friends as a part of our late night drive. Well, for statrters, this place does have a nice, cozy ambience. It was very late so there were really few people around! But... my goodness! I've never expected such low quality food from such a place! We ordered a lobster preparation. It cost around 1100 bucks! And to add to  our astonishment, the portion would not suffice  even for two people! Plus, the quality of the lobster was not even close to okay! The fish bucket was kind of nice though! I would suggest if you are planning to visit this place, go for the buffet instead! The a-la-carte menu is a bit risky. For we had to find out a pizza place even after dining there and paying 5000 bucks! ( i swear our liquor bill was pretty within limit). And I have quit eating lobster after that day!

Live grill, fish aquariums and warm decor will boost up your dining experience. Mutton & pork vindaloo will impress for sure. The showstealers will however will be their dessert spread- prophet rolls, brownie and hot gulab jamuns to name a few!

I went to the restaurant with my girlfriend. We ordered a grilled masala crab and a poached lobster thermidor. The crab was a disappointment because:
1. It wasn't fleshy enough. Thick shelled but didn't have meat.
2. The staff never gave us a crab cutter or a pick. We had to use our bare hands and make a fool of ourselves.
The lobster more than made up for the crab. It was divine and probably the best I've ever tasted.
I'm giving the restaurant a 3 star because of the slow service and incompetent staff. Otherwise it's a nice place to go out on a Sunday afternoon.
P.S. I'd still suggest everyone to opt for Barbeque Nation on the opposite side of the road if you aren't dying to have a lobster for lunch.

It was on 24th Dec that we decided to head for a buffet dinner as our belated anniversary treat!A group of 5 we quite easily found seat in Ocean grill and since it was Christmas eve they had some special menus.

Coming to ambiance this being my maiden visit to this place loved the decor and of course their service.¬†
For the buffet part though I am not really into clicking pics but I can pretty well describe the food.

For starter they had served us both veg and non veg items it was a huge array of ¬†kebabs and others:
Allo tandoori
mix veg grill
paneer grill
chicken barbecue wings
mini veg puff
fried small fish
mutton seekh kebab
fish kebab
chicken seekh kebab
crispy baby corn
I think that was it if I am not missing anything! this accompanied with fresh lime soda as a complimentary drink.

For main course they had :
steamed rice
dal makhani (which needs improvement)
noodles
crab
flavored rice
mutton biriyani (cooked really well)
fish in mustard sauce
duck in palm sauce
Turkey
mutton gravy
chicken gravy
soup
veg au gratin (cooked really well and cheesy)
pasta in white sauce ( nicely done) along with two non veg salads, papad,raita.

I have no idea of the veg main course since I was not really interested in it.

For dessert they deserve a praise not many varieties but all were good and appetizing.
They had yoghurt,gulab jamun,baked alaska, brownie,assorted pastry ¬†choco lava cake, and a cheese filled creamy rolls dipped in chocolate sauce.

In total the variety was pretty good ,taste wise some were hit and some miss.¬†
Price wise we wee charged 1049 with tax approx per head!

Well i wont be able to compare in that way since i always have a soft corner for another buffet place ,but yes this is worth trying and ¬†must be tried by every foodie.

¬†I had visited Ocean grill with my Team for Dinner. Located in Sector 5 right opposite to RDB Cinemas. Quite a spacious outlet with a nice decor along with aquariums and fishing nets. As the name says ocean the only colour that could come to your mind is blue and yes the entire restaurant was lit with blue LED lights.

The buffet was realy good.Delicious foods had been tested and their mouth watering startes. It was a mix of Asian along with continental followed with Indian. Everyone can find something or the other of their choice and food lovers like me would love to taste all and I indeed tasted all.

. The most wonderful part is that in the middle of our meal Mr. Shane Chatterjee introduced himself and asked that how was the food, latter on we came to know he was the Executive Chef and Director ,its really good to see there are still restaurant who give attention to their customers ,he was a nice guys introduced us with his stand up musical team,and made them sing few of their best tracks .

Its was a pleasure coming here for buffet. Keep up the excellent work Ocean grill team .

Amazing Buffetüòòüòò
Had a very early breakfast and was starving till 2 in the afternoon and finally ended up at this lovely place. Located in Sector 5 right opposite to RDB Cinemas. Quite a spacious outlet with a nice decor  along with aquariums and fishing nets. As the name says ocean the only colour that could come to your mind is blue and yes the entire restaurant was lit with blue LED lights.
Now let's come to the food part. A very elaborate lunch buffet at 699+taxes. There were 6 starters, 4 salads, 2 soups, 6 main course along with 4 accompaniments , a nice collection of Veg dishes, an amazing dessert section and last but not the least, tea and coffee and aerated drinks.
Isn't that an elaborate one??

It was a mix of Pan Asian along with continental followed with by Indian. Everyone can find something or the other of their choice and food lovers like me would love to taste all and I indeed tasted all.

Among the many starters Reshmi Kabab, Harabhara Fish kebab , American Corn Salt and Pepper and Hot Wings in Buffalo Sauce was amazing. 

There were two chicken based and two vegetable based salad . Choice of soup from veg and non veg accompanied by bread basked.

Now Main Course ... Here I can't mention all coz all were good in taste but I would try to mention the most excellent ones.

Vegetable Au Gratin
Fish in Mustard Sauce
Paneer Paturi 
Singapore Chilli Crab
Chicken in Mushroom Sauce
Pork Vindaloo 

Accompanied By

Steamed Rice
Mutton Biriyani 
Veg Hakka Noodles 
Chef Special Pasta.

There all are a must try and I tasted them all and I am quite satisfied. The most wonderful part is that in the middle of our meal a server came and asked that how was the food?? I answered that the taste was great but the Pork and the Fish was bit on the salty side. 

And after that what happened really made my day. There was one lady who must be the owner or a senior manager, she took charge and sent both the food for checking in the kitchen while it was only 10 mins left for the buffet to end. In that short period of time they fixed both the dishes and got them back and offered us to taste. And it was perfect!!! 

This was really not required but it shows that how proactive she was to ensure that customer satisfaction should be at optimum and I would make sure that I refer this to all my friends and colleagues.
It was nothing but a little effort that made all the difference.
Let's keep it short and say about the dessert section..
Prophet Roll üòç
Assorted Pastries 
Brownies 
Mousse
Caramel Custard 
Gulab Jamun
Baked Alaska
And obviously a fresh fruit platter.

All together I was full to the brim and it was a wonderful experience to be here. All the servers kept an eye on the table to ensure that we faced no problems which is appreciated. Moreover I would refer this to everyone. Come here and experience the true hospitality here.

Such a widespread lavish buffet at sector v! Though there are tough competitions, but this place surely offers decent and reasonable rates. Today went for the lunch buffet where they had 6 veg and nonveg starters! Kebabs being the best of them all, especially fish kebabs they were perfectly flavored and soft. In veg started liked the salt and pepper corn, also the baby corn. Prawn cocktail was on the sweeter side. 
Soup was served after the entr√©e, I preferred to jump into the main course directly! So there was an array of vegetarian and non vegetarian delicacies, in vegetarian I liked the veg augratin and paneer paturi the best! In non veg they had herbed rice and mutton biryani as the starch, they had pork vindaloo, Singaporean crabs, chicken in creamy mushroom sauce, fish in mustard sauce and Afghani murgh. Pork vindaloo and mustard fish were my personal favorites! 
For dessert they had pastries, prophet rolls, baked alaska , brownie slices, mousse, caramel custard, gulab jamun and fresh cut fruits! The brownie and prophet rolls were the only showstealers! 
Service was good, a bit delayed but very courteous and hospitable. Loved the decor, only suggestion would be proper maintenance of the inventories and food quality. :)

We had gone to Barbeque Nation, but there was a 2 hour waiting period, so we just saw around and saw Ocean Grill-took a chance and went in. The ambiance was great and the decoration of the place was eye catching. We took the non-veg buffet which was 650+taxes. The starters were very good. Well I think they can improve main course. Prawn cock
tail was superb.
The best part was the service. All the staff members were very humble and polite.
 Bar is also available. It was a good experience.

May be I had high expectations even though I was fore warned. ¬†The place is too small for customers to walk to the main course counter. ¬†Had lunch there yesterday with my wife, we were the 2nd set of customers to arrive and subsequently the restaurant was full. ¬†Starters were served at our table after 3 reminders. ¬†The veg starters was bad. ¬†Since the restaurant was full, customers were elbowing each other at the main course counter. ¬†The pork vindaloo was bad to say the least, the pork was 'hard'. the crabs too did not appeal. Veg au gratin was liquidy with hardly any cheese. Never again am I going to visit them. Flame and grill is a much better option

Today was my 5th visit to this restaurant. The rating has steadily come down after each visit. Only reason to visit this restaurant is lack of patience to wait outside for Barbeque Nation. But i am sure this was my last visit to Ocean Grill. Each time i had opted for their buffet lunch.
This time i found that tandoor items  have been reduced to 4 varieties only. Both thumbs down for taste and quality.
Buffet menu is completely uninteresting. Poor taste n quality.
Desserts are  outrageously poor. 
Ambience - AC doesnt work, flies all around the place... surprising! 
Staff lacks warmth and are completely lethargic. 

And on top if this they charge a 7%service charge..

Perfect place for a grand meal after catching a movie in RDB (situated just next to it). They have done justice to their name - as you enter you will start admiring their 'Oceanic' themed interiors, the tables too have an option to fix a Grill stand. Ample option of delicacies, especially of fishes and chicken. The flavours of the foods were well blended. Liked the Butter Chicken Tikka Masala much. 

Well behaved staffs and prompt service. But the pocket pinch for two would be around Rs.1200 (at least). However, worth a discovery! :)

It was my long term wish to visit this place,  but when I actually did it came out to be more of a disappointing experience. We tried the dinner buffet. Being located just opposite to barbecue nation, it automatically raises your expectations. But nothing in the whole buffet menu actually stood out. 
I read this in the other reviews and I agree with that the quality of food they serve is not always fresh.  Ocean grill specializes in sea food items,  but fish items tasted particularly bland. Starters were like normal buffet which we find everywhere. Main course spread was also small.  
Among the food items what I liked most were the desserts. They actually gave me a happy ending after so much disappointment. 
The things which I liked about this place were its ambience and   their hospitality.  The interior is very beautifully decorated with an oceanic essence. They also play live music. The staffs are very courteous and happy to help. 
I don't know whether trying the ala carte menu would have made things any better or not. But my first experience won't happily permit a second one.

The starter menu was quite interesting. Various options were there. They served mini prawns dipped in mayo in shot glasses. This item was out of the world. 
The main course and dessert was average.
Overall if you don't get a reservation in Barbeque nation you can try this place once.

Keep it up Ocean Grill team. Boost up your service and thats all you need to grab more and more favourable reviews. The üòä on the faces of the stewards is what is required. Train them asap.

I want to say some basic things you need to maintain in food services industry,never ever ever serve leftover or stale food, taste can be little up down people understand that,but the moment you serve leftover or stale food the person is never coming back again,i know it hard regarding the competition is bbq nation just opposite but thats an opportunity too,if you serve good food people will chose your place over a crowded one.
I have heard some good things about this place so i came here to try,you have a huge place compared to bbq but your food,service is no where near that small place.

Situated right Opposite to the famous Barbeque nation Saltlake branch. We made a compelled visit as BBQ was out of slots for 2 people. Ocean grill however charged more than BBQ but failed to reach the quality & range of starters. Moreover, it took so much time to serve the repeat starters that literally shattered the hunger. In case of deserts,it does not have any kulfis or ice creams... More or less, if you fail to grab a seat in BBQ, head towards Ocean grill at you own risk...

Been there in a weekend. Food quality and taste leave a lot to be desired as the output did not match expectations. Service was good but no way matches its well known peers in Sector V.
Fish item served as snacks was stale and when I pointed that out to the boys there was no reaction nor was any apology. Surprised at that.

We find it lacking on the buffet menu, insufficient food supply and unprofessional behavior. The buffet menu is below worst quality neither have any tastes. You can try street food than ‚ÄúOcean Grill‚Äù.

As compare to 800 INR per head it is below negative rating. Please never go to ‚ÄúOcean Grill‚Äù. It is better to go ‚ÄúChai Break‚Äù 500 INR per head just right hand side of BBQ :)

Ovean grill is located at a prime location of sector 5. Ocean grill could have been a good option around sector 5 to dine but when you have a competition with barbeque nation it's tough. It's supposed to have variety of fish items but i find it lacking on the buffet menu. The buffet menu is nothing to boast about neither the tastes extraordinary. Visit only if you want to have buffet and barbeque nation has lot of queue. Though i would have preferred waiting. I found ala carte option to be better but also for ala carte you have do many options around.

Situated bang opposite to bar b q nation (saltlake branch). Ocean grill is a must try for seafood lovers. Its a really nice restauratnt with underwater theme. Staffs are v.cordial and gave us a warm welcome. The owner of the restaurant turned up for helping us in ordering the foods. They do have a buffet system but didnot go for that. For starter we had Chicken A La Kiev. It was served with veggies and masshies. Then for mains we ordered seafood platter which includes (prawns,squid,,mussels,sea bass,clams,crabs alonwith lobster) served with herb rice and garlic bread. One thing we missed is octopus. But the seafood platter didnot dissapointed us. Tried mussels and sea bass for the first time. Must say it was worth trying. For drinks we had coke and lime cordial.
Price was on the higher side. Will not complain as the food was really good.

After going through a varied range of reviews, I finally decided to hit this place on this Sunday with my boyfriend for a lunch eat out. We went for the buffet which was around 840 INR per head. What really struck me was the staff behavior which was definitely top-notch and cordial. The ambiance was more or less simple. Now coming to the food, the starters were good and had quite a variety. But the taste somehow seemed Okay-ish and nothing unusual. The shrimps were pretty tasty. The main course was also okay types since the Biriyani was bland and the crabs were quite dry. The chicken served on the main course was quite delicious. The dessert was much better and the Baked Alaska was the clear winner.
Overall a good experience and I hope if they make some revisions in their buffet menu then surely things will be much better.

With a decor to go with the name the place provides a unique yet amazing buffet experience....though the mocktail is limited only to lime soda and soft drinks, the starters are extra ordinary....veg starters include the likes of crispy chilli baby corn, egg plant chips, veg croquets,paneer etc...non veg includes shammi kebab, chckn tikka kebab,fish tikka,hariyali kebab,chckn wings, mourala machh something u don't usually find in a buffet starter but it tasted amazing and ofcourse their signature dish-- prawn cocktail.

Mains included items like biriyani,herb rice, paneer paturi, veg augratin,chckn in musroom sauce,chilly pork,fish in lemon mustard sauce and the biggest surprise is the singaporean crab, though some people might find it a bit difficult to manage a whole crab.

Desserts were however a bit let down compared to the starters and mains. There were baked alaska, brownie, strawberry pastry, gulab jamun, cold cuts and profiteroles,

As for service the first round of starters were mind blowing, but being a glutton that we are we took second helping of almost every item in the starter and to our utter dismay most of them took a steep dive in terms of taste and were pretty difficult to relate with the first round.

THIS SEA IS SHALLOW...

A winter tour to Nicco Park for my daughter preceded our buffet lunch here. The menu had a great variety although sea-food variants were less. My expectation of octopus and squids was not met. I found the place overhyped.

I have eaten multiple times at this place. The last time we went to celebrate bhaiphonta family lunch. Food wise it is quite ok; ambience is really nice and the employees are very courteous and helpful. However I think they can replace the crab item in their main course with shrimp or lobster as the crab does not have much meat into it and it was not very appealing. I personally did find the mutton biriyani to be more oily than my tolerance level, however it tasted good. The dessert section does not have anything new to offer. I was disheartened to see that the gulab jamun was not warm, but it tasted good.The starters which they serve on the table are good. Overall it's a good place and definitely worth visiting. Next time I want to try their seafood options to see how good they are.

Visited this place for a taste of seafood.. And they haven't disappointed me. A bit costly place but taste is good. We ordered for seafood platter and fish bucket... Everything is damn good. One should try this place. They have a buffet option also. But believe me I don't like mutton biriyani in seafood buffet.

Located in Salt lake Sector 5,I feel this restaurant struggles because of the frenzy that surrounds Bar-B-QNation which is situated bang opposite to this. But to be honest I have always found this one to be¬†better simply because of the variety it offers. It has a good mix of fish,chicken and veg starters and the main course also has a nice combination of Indian as well as continental spread. So if you cannot find a place in Bar-B-Nation this can be¬† very good alternative.

The ambience is really nice and services is also very good. The mocktails like polar bear and forever young are really nice. The chicken sultani kebab is awesome and lamb tandoori is nice. The grilled chicken is good.  The pad Thai noodles is quite good but the mongolian chicken is so so. The brownie is excellent and the traditional cheesecake is also quite good. The caramel Custard is totally mind blowing. Overall it is very good experience.

Went there with family and we chose to order a la carte. We ordered mushroom cappachino for soup and the seafood laksa. The soups were very well prepared. For starters, both fish basket and the salt n pepper mix seafood was delicious. The lamb steak for mains and the sea food platter was again excellent. For dessert the tiramisu is what we ordered and it was nice. Overall good experience and we were very happy with the food and service.

We had a pretty bad experience here during nabami night. At first we were told that we had to wait half an hour for buffet, which we found quite reasonable given the rush during the pujas, and we were quite excited with what the buffet menu offered at the reception. However that half hour turned into one and a half hour. Then after repeatedly asking for water we finally got some. The major surprise was the buffet itself which had the smallest spread we have ever seen at any buffet. It has just 4 starters 2veg and 2 non veg which too took a lot of time for them to serve. The main course section had a chaat corner and we had to prepare the chaats ourselves, and since its impossible for any one to make fuchkas and chaats with one hand while holding your plate with the other it was a torturous experience. The other items in the main course didn't have much to offer too. In the mean time we were told that while we were waiting to get a table the buffet had changed and the buffet we were having was much smaller and cheaper than what we saw at the reception. This is a clear case of misguiding the customers. To end the dinner on an even bitter note,  the dessert didn't even have ice cream. I mean what buffet doesn't have ice cream? Even the smallest of buffets have ice cream. When we finally came out we realized that we have wasted 3hrs of the last night of puja at this restaurant. I am never coming back here and am strictly going to advise people from visiting this place.

I went for the international food buffet spread yesterday with my family. The spread was massive. They offered many chicken, fish and veg grilled starters, prawn cocktail, crispy chilli babycorn, harabhara kebabs, american corn etc. Starters were delicious and we were so full already. Coming to the mains, we loved the chilli crabs which is quite unique and dont think any other restaurant offer in their buffet. Mutton biriyani, muglai chicken item, bhetki paturi and lemon butter fish were all delicious. This was one of the best buffets we have ever had. Good choice in desserts too. We will definitely go back again.

I went for the Puja buffet on Ashtami lunch.  It was probably one of the most crowded restaurants as their buffet is one of the most famous ones in town. The spread was a mix of bengali, chinese,muglai and continental plus chaats and huge number of starters and deserts. Out of the massive spread, items that stood out was the bhetki paturi, mutton biriyani, crabs cooked in bengali style and the chicken kabiraji. Paneer paturi was another outstanding item for vegetarians. Overall great experience, great hospitality and I am definitely going back again to try out their international food buffet spread which I have heard of from friends as one of the most popular buffets in town.

On account of Durga Puja, they're running a special buffet @ Rs. 849 + tax.

Let's put this in sequential order:
We had to hold back due to long queue and finally they called up.

Over next first 30 minutes, we were given nothing except the white dishes; it appeared as if getting a seat here is a big accomplishment let alone the buffet plate.¬†
Note: starters were not available for self service.¬†

I lamented about the proceedings to floor manager and he assured that the items will start flowing immediately.¬†
Then this is how it unfolded - started with one Fish Kabiraji and then disruption...we started pleading..then came Chicken wings..and then again disruption. Then Mourala bhaja and it was stinking so exuberantly that I had to put this away.

Then jumped off to main course and this has been another disappointment. Two center items: bhetki paturi ‚Äì was getting empty every now and then, taking longer to refill in; chingri malaikari ‚Äì hardly any flesh around the sticks. ¬†It was dreadful that, despite this price tag, there was no ice cream.

It was on Saptami night when we were at the place and the service is so pathetic that it turned out to Ashtami there itself. People from other tables were shouting, as we overheard, that they can‚Äôt consume non-veg on Ashtami. There was an aged lady was screaming with full force on the quantity of fried rice offered.

Overall it was complete disorder and chaos, and hope that this was 1-off day due to festivals!

The service of this restaurant was awful. Although the ambience was good, they started off with serving cold shorba. We asked them to bring it after properly boiling it, but it was of no avail. We drank the cold soup with cold heart. Similar story was with starters. The pasta that we ordered took them a millennia to cook/serve. After following up several times, we had to finally cancel the order. They did not have any mocktails to serve or so the waiter said.Overall, the whole experience was bad.

I dont know why this resturent is little bit under rated in zomato?
I had an opportunity to take their buffet lunch...
I must say, that was the one of the best buffet in kolkata... They served everything... From best of kebab to sea food.. Most balance buffet in kolkata..
They served kebab,fish, pork, crab and biriyani.. They also have lots of veg item in their buffet menu. Desert section was also good.. Over all it was a very nice experience for me with a very reasonable price..
They also served one complimentary cold drink with each buffet meal.
One suggestion for management: If possible please improve your main course section. You need to serve rice roti noodles along with biriyani in main section. And please change the pork recipe... I am a big big pork lover but somehow I didt like the item. 

If you change little bit of your main course and desert section I must say you will be the best buffet serve in kolkata..
Thank you

Located opposite to Barbeque Nation in Salt Lake Sector V, this place is not for vegetarians. I happended to visit this place once hoping that it would somehow satisfy me but being a vegetarian I was completely disheartened. My colleagues seemed content with the sea food they had ordered but my north indian food was not upto the mark. Apart from the north indian food, I also ordered thai, which again was a let down. 
Overall the ambience and the decor is soothing to the eye and ears. However the food spoils everything or me.

They only cared about us, until we were seated. After that it became 'ghar ki murgi daal barabar.'. No one bothered to come and take our orders. Finally we ordered crab for the main. They guy who took down our orders, he said, this is a soft shelled crab and it would be properly cracked as well, so that we can eat hazard free. When it finally arrived, it was a hard shelled crab and it was not cracked open. We had to *ask* for that thingy to crack open the crab shell and the crab legs. The portions were super small for the price. They were severely undermanned and the folks who WERE there, they were so not into it. It took them more than 1 hour to server our appetizers. When we asked for the bill, we had to wait for 30+ minutes again. I would probably not go back to this place.

What a horrific restaurant. Yesterday , at nite i went for Ocean Grill Midnight Buffet at 12:40 am. I phoned and book them around 6 pm on that same day. At first, no booking was there, although they confirmed me over phone. Then we sat for 15 mins, (thats ok during puja). We got sit, no water was asked, they came and told starter will be served, then we can go for the main Menu Buffet. We sat for 20 mins and there was this loud music, ufff.
No food was served, till no water¬† was asked. Then a guy came named Arjun and told us go for main course, we will serve the starter within 10 mins. Since, it was buffet we went to the place where foood was served.
1. No plates.
2. Only few veg items , with cold temp.
3. Only rice in biriyani
4. No chicken, fish and mutton
5. No serve man 
6. and finally, when we came back to our sit- sit was occupied by other customer.

What is this????

Came to this place with a group of 9. Service is extremely slow, an order of beer pints took them about half an hour to serve. Orders made:
1) Chicken fried rice: tasted bad, too salty and not at all worth the price charged. A roadside food stall makes better Chicken fried rice.
2) Nachos: Changed the very definition of what Nachos are. Tasted bland with Mayo on top. Fried papad with toppings was what it was.
3) Chicken kabab: tasted good.( The reason for a rating of 1)
4) Fish bucket: Fried Fish, average (the reason for .5 rating)
Ambience is good but I suppose the only reason the place would be chosen is if no other place around has seats available.

Hi everyone. Just thought to share my experience in this restaurant. It ws my first visit to this place yestrdy nd sure it wl b the last one. I had orderd for buffet.. the buffet spread was exceptionally bad. The starters wer mostly veg nd none of them taste good. Moreover i felt that the food ws a bit old since there ws a typical smell coming frm it. Taste ws also below average. Now coming to the main course. Main course ws complimenting the starter. It maintained its legacy of being equally worse. There ws chingri malai curry where the prawns wer not properly processed nd the biriyani had a typical bad smell..the service was also really bad.. i dnt know how they can serve such a ridiculous buffet course during the puja nd cheat the customer by claiming that they r serving the largest nd lavish buffet spread. On top of that the price ws also very high. The non veg lunch buffet costs approx 1100 inclusive of tax which is quite high and costs more than buffet served in bar b q nation or flame nd grill and not at all worth..so it is real waste of money. I wud rate it in negative if had the option of doing that.

I had been to this place (salt lake sector 5) and felt that hardly it was worth spending the time and money. The service at this place was awful mediocre food quality! Once they serve a starter, they will never repeat it. They were serving salted sweet corn and a preparation of fish (mourola fish). We asked them to repeat it, and after waiting for 40 minutes and asking for 13 another times to different waiters we got it only a spoonful of it. We asked for more but didn't get it again. Hell, I thought it was supposed to be all you can eat restaurant. The prawn preparation was certainly not up to the mark. It was some prawn cocktail, which hardly have much of prawn in it. Now when the grill part came, it became more interesting. They were serving only one stick of chicken or fish to 2 people. They will not serve more than 1 stick. Again for a repeat you have to wait for another 10-15 minutes. The last part of the feedback is the best....they gave me the bill, without being asked for it, when I was still having the dessert. They didn't have the least of the curtsy that the bill should be presented once a customer is done with his food.  As far as the food quality and variety is concerned, I will say that it of average quality. The grill part didn't have any wow factor, it had only chicken breast , and wings, and fish and not chicken leg. The buffet part was equally average with normal chicken biryani and soups and normal other dishes. The dessert had few small pieces of watermelon and pappaya and gulab jamoon. There were also some cakes which tasted like Bapuji cake of road side tea stall.  I will never visit this place nor would I recommend anyone to visit this place.

This place was on my list for a long time but after reading so many negative reviews on zomato I hesitated to choose ocean grill over bbq nation. Finally one fine day influenced by a seafood lover friend of mine I agreed to visit this place.
We opted for buffet. I don't know why people write so much negative comments about this place.
I mean this place is situated just opp. to Barbeque nation. When your next door competitor holds such a big name you've to improve your standard to that level or higher. Ocean grill as the name suggests is a paradise for seafood lovers.
üçπüç∏üç∑üç∂üç∫üçª
We were offered a glass of complementary drink. There were a few soft drinks but we preferred fresh lime soda.
In the starter fish, chicken kebabs and mutton shammi kebabs were there but I kinda missed prawn kebab but üç§ Prawn cocktail stole my mind. üòá It was heavenly.
üçñüçóüç≥üç≤üå≠üçõüçúüçùüå∂üßÄ
In the main course the number of dishes are significantly more. I could barely taste each and every one. Special mention PORK VINDALOO. üëå One of the best pork dishes I've ever had. Also I've to mention FISH IN CREAMY MUSTARD SAUCE , it was delicious.
CHICKEN PERI PERI is worth mentioning. There was a crab item also. Since I'm not a crab love i haven't tried that. Mutton biryani was above average.
üç¶üçßüç®üç©üéÇüç∞üç´üçÆüçØ
In the dessert section there were CARAMEL CUSTARD, HOT GULAB JAMUN, BAKED ALASKA, DESSERT SLICES. All were great especially baked alaska.

Really a lovely experience. Looking forward to visit next time.

Food's tasty.
There's a a hell lot to choose from...which is one of my must-haves in a buffet.

Non-veg fish starters were delightful.
The veggies wont score much.

Coming to the main course,I loved the salads.
But the pork was tid undercooked.
They lack the proper cutlery for crabs...which tasted good as long as I could get to the flesh.

Dessert..well..Okayish is the word.

Ambience is fantastic.

And the manager has a great taste in music if I may add.

P.S Not over-priced;must go.

Quite happy with the buffet menu. Was surprised to see that they have prawn cocktail and (mourola)fish fry which was quite yummy. Main spread had crab, pork in addition to amazing fish, chicken dish and mutton biriyani. Plus the desserts had an amazing spread as well including baked alaska. All in all it definitely went beyond just meeting expectations! Good job team Ocean Grill!!

As the name says grill ,it can't be compared with speciality group of restaurant brands like Flame and grill,global grill.tge service is not good as we were waiting and waiting for the starters.as we know that in buffet starters are the main,but we have to ask them to repeat..main course food is average,only the pork was good,infact very good.others like crab and fish are not so good.

Most people who doesn't get a place in Barbeque Nation which is just opposite this place in Sector 5 come to this joint. Apparently it looks fine till the time u actually start eating here. Twice in my visit to this place I found that the spread was fulfilling and it had a variety of dishes in the starter range. U can have enough chicken, prawn, paneer, mutton/lamb in the starters and not go to the main course. But yes the main course is decent. Another attraction is the dessert range. We had lot of fun here in my birthday lunch and bachelor's dinner.

High expectation turned worst experience.putting grill on the table doesnt make a restaurant barbeque nation.you have to maintain quality and good service to compete with well known restaurant.after not getting table on barbeque nation we office group turned to ocean grill.we are 10 people went their for lunch on 2.45 pm.sadly by that time one of their desert item finished(gulab jamun)pathetic admin.though their buffet price is higher side and more than their compititor but their items is less.test was awful.mutton on the biriyani finished,people had to wait for the mutton pieces.they cant manage small gathering.hardly 20 guest present their including us.they serve pork vindalu in main course dish.pork and beef item still unacceptable for some people.so this item should replace with other item.overall experience is pathetic.food quality was not upto the mark.beside prawn cocktail and bar-b-que chicken wings in starter and crab curry in main cource is good.

We have been there last Sunday lunch with my family. Excellent decor catch our attraction. They welcome us with fresh lime soda. Then start with starter prawn cocktel ,2 or 3 type chicken kebab, fish kebab, veg and much more, total 8 or 9 veraity. After that main course with mutton biriyani, chicken afagani and another 1 item, chili crap, mutton , pork and 2 -3 item more. All item are tasty. Speciali pork & mutton biriyani. But after too good food we very much disappoint about dessert. No ice cream.we all expecting finish with ice cream.and another thing very very slow service and refilling.they must look in to matter. Overall very nice time spend with family. Hope near future we visit again and that time I change my rating from 4 to 5.

Buffet dinner at ocean grill......it was a disaster....Didn't have idea that its gonna be this bad.Dear og management....please train your waiters how to serve in a buffet...they were totally untrained and hence,the service was damn poor....coming to food quality...it was probably the worst i have tasted in my life....be it starters or main course....only decent was the dessert section...

I dont know about ala carte....but please dont go for a buffet there...there's lot more better places to offer for buffet meal....it was our mistake we wanted to try buffet at a different place.

The food of the restaurant is average compared to its price. A-la-carte food is tastewise good. I tried one clay oven baked salad and herb crusted oven baked vetki and salt and pepper squid fry. Presentation was good. Salad was full of vegetables and had reasonable amount of chicken. Fish item and squid were pretty good. My friends opted for the buffet. Variety of items is huge - plenty of options in veg and in non-veg item it included chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, crab and pork. BUT none of the items is worth mentioning. You will hardly feel like repeating any item which typically happens in good buffets like bar-b-q-nations. Deserts again large varieties but you will not remember a single item once you finish the meal. However the buffet price is not very high compared to the wide range of food. But taste wise very average. The restaurant was almost empty on a Friday lunch time....so if u want to have a peaceful and quiet lunch, you may try it ONE TIME with the A-LA-CARTE menu

Very good ambience - beautiful bluish seafood theme on every corner and with sharks engraved on its wall with an amazing bar. Staffs are very friendly. May be will visit again to try out their seafood buffet.

Had been here before for buffet lunch, but I don't really recall the menu. I only remember eating a lot of fried fish, and being drawn to the boat shaped buffet holder :P But I went there again later to treat myself to lunch. I chose a la carte this time.
I was given a comfortable seat, and the staff was very polite. I loved their jellyfish lights!
I had a seafood risotto, which was really yummy! I'm giving 0.5 less for the price. The a la carte menu is way too expensive. The risotto and a glass of lime soda cost me almost the same as their buffet (which included a lot more items plus a drink)!

Located,  just across the street to Barbque nation, sector 5, this restro is also known for serving buffet, especially sea food. The start was promising but hardly in competition these days. Quality of food is not at all up to the mark, considering the other eateries around. Restro staffs lack in professionalism. Pricing is not aligned with the quality of dishes and ambience.

Dropped by this place as part of a office celebration  with my colleagues. The food was good though it could improve. The veg items were passable though some like the paneer and potato starters were either a bit too salted and spiced up or bland.  The non veg items were tasty especially the mustard fish  and chicken wings.  The main course and desert was good.

Ocean grill is a themed family restaurant situated bang opposite to the RDB Bolevard in sector 5. The decor is done very well. As the name suggsets this restaurant specialises on seafood. The chilli crab which was served to us was quite soft and tender. We had orderded a fish in beer batter, the fish was smelly and tasted quite bad. The service is very slow and you have to wait for a long time for your food. Some of the dishes are quite tasty but some of them are not. :)

Went for a lunch buffet on Sunday...
Located Just opposite Barbeque nation (sector v)..
Ocean grilll is a themed restaurant and it is very nicely decorated... I loved their theme of under water... Ambiance is also good...

We chose fresh lime as welcome drink among the drinks they offered..
They had a huge list of Starters... Approx. 10 items including veg and non veg...
Corn item, Chilli baby corn, egg plant chips, Mutton shammi kebab, ¬†Fish starter, prawn cocktail, chicken wings... ANd 3 kind of grilled items( Paneer, fish and chicken) .. Among the starters Prawn cocktail needs a special mention here.. otherwise ¬†Chilli baby corn, fish starter and chicken wings were very tasty... mutton kebab was undercooked.... Grilled items were not at all upto the mark... ¬†Kebab experience was very bad..¬†
Service was good but they were serving the starters too fast....

List of main course was also quite lengthy.. They had rice, herb rice and mutton biriyani.. some veg items.. 2 types of salad.. IN non veg there were 1 fish item, 2 Chicken item, 1 pork item and CRab item.. The crab was cooked in a perfect manner.. i just loved it..¬†

Though I heard that their desert menu contained mainly Indian sweets like malpoa, pantua etc... so, my expectation was not that high... But we found the desert menu quite different.. ¬†There were donought, brownie, strawberry pastry, baked alska, caramel custard, fruits, tea etc...
Pastry, baked alska, custard were yummy... I loved it...
Overall nice experience..

Hello foodies! A buffet experience after quite a long time and it was good overall :)
Turned down by the queue of barbeque nations ,we stepped in here
Amabiance was impressive. There was a little sweet aquarium .The backdrop was kept in accordance with it's name.
Coming to food, they had a good variation of items. In starters they have two kind of fish and chicken kebabs,one prawn and one mutton item other than some veg items. The prawn cocktail won my heart as well as the chicken kebabs. The paneer kebab tasted blunt. The crispy chilli babycorn was good .
In main course, biriyani was the hero over all. The pork and crab were flawless as well. (Don't remember the exact names)
Desserts section was a pure bliss. I loved their baked alaska, chocolate donut, chocolate brownie cake. The caramel custard wasn't upto the mark. Missed the gulab jamun, as I was already full till the neck.
The staffs were cordial.
Another must mention is their music . They have a wide collection of English songs ranging from 80's till date and that was something I couldn't find anywhere before. They should try to improve the quality of some items and we'll be eagerly waiting for their new additions. They have to work way harder keeping in mind that their rivals in neighbourhood are serving the best buffet in town.

It was a horrible experience. I had visited this place on a Sunday. There were 4 of us. We had taken the buffet. The service was horrible. The food was worser. They took around half an hour to serve one pepsi. I don't know for what. And the way they were serving the kebabs, as if they do not want us to eat only. Overall it was a very very bad experience. Also, a complete waste of money. We had a bill of 4316 for the 4 of us and it was a complete waste of money. Nothing else. I would suggest everyone not to try out this restaurant. It was a very very bad experience. I kept on asking the waiters to serve something and I had keep on asking, but nobody bothered. Totally disgusted.

The service is little bit slow in crowded environment. The buffet menu had a large varieties and it contained prawn, crab etc apart from fish and chicken. But I would say the taste could have been better.

A long Thursday queue at Bbq nation forced me to look towards the opposite side of the road and that's what took me to this restaurant, lol...
Well, let's get to basics... With a name as "Ocean Grill", you would expect a beautifully themed restaurant with excellent seating arrangements. Truth is, it isn't. Decorated mostly as a plain-faced restaurant with modest seating arrangements, it will leave you and your expectations dry. 

Moving on..

You get a modest  number of choices of starters to begin your gastronomical endeavour, and some of them are really good, but not great... You might expect some seafood starters, but sadly speaking, you won't.. And that kind of set me off a bit..

The main course also has a number of options, however, none of them are too good to leave a lasting impression. Desserts options are way too simple, nothing as special as you expect for the money you would shell out..  

Overall, a 3.0/5.0 as "Ocean Grill" really needs some cosmetic and inventory changes.. The location is a prime spot, just opposite RDB cinemas, and a restuarant should capitalise well here, given it makes the right choices and takes the right steps..

We ordered every possiible item on the menu. The staff was extremely helpful, they even offered us a 10% discount on our total bill. 

Our items ranged from fish to chicken to mutton, chosen from varied cuisines.

The name itself made me excited to try their food.  I tried their buffet as well as A la carte.  They serve various kind of starter,  starting from prawn cocktail to kebab. I didn't like the prawn cocktail much as the taste of thousand island was over powering the taste of prawns..  Kebabs were better than that.  The Queen of starter was fiery chicken wings..  So tasty that I kept on licking my finger. I find their Main course menu better than any other similar restaurants because the way they made their Singaporean crab,  it was yummilicious. My favorite was pork vindaloo though.  I felt their main course is better than starters.. Now let's talk about my favorite part- dessert.  Baked Alaska was the only item that made me visit the restaurant again..  I didn't like other desserts much.  I felt they should have kept few sea food items( other than crab) as name of the restaurant portrays the first impression..  
The next time when I visited the restaurant,  I made my mind that I am not going to go for buffet as there is nothing very special about it and I ventured their A LA Carte as I have a crazy love for seafood.  And I fell for their salt N pepper mixed seafood and lamb involvtini. 
Price meter : price of the buffet is reasonable but choosing from a LA Carte is  bit expensive compared to the quantity of food. 
So next time you visit this restaurant make sure that you try food from a LA Carte specially the mixed sea food platter or salt N pepper mixed sea food.

WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE TODAY THAN TO DECIDE OUR TEAM GATHERING AT OCEAN GRILL AS BARBEQUE NATION HAD SOME WAITING TIME. AT THE END OF IT ALL OF US HAD A REGRET TO OPT FOR THIS PATHETIC RESTAURANT FOOD AND SERVICE. THEY ARE EXTREMELY SLOW AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO ETERNITY TO GET THE FOOD. NO VARIETY AT ALL IN THE STARTERS AND THEY KEEP ON IGNORING WHAT YOU SAY AND REQUEST FOR. WE HAD A LONG WAIT FOR THE TABLE AND IT HAS TO BE AS THEY ARE SLOWER THAN THE TORTOISE IN SERVING. WITH ALL THIS WE FINALLY DECIDED TO QUIT THE STARTERS (ANY WAYS THOSE WERE AS BAD AS THE SERVICE) AND NO GUESSES NO ONE WAS BOTHERED TO SEE THAT FOR MAIN COURSE MAJORITY OF THE FOOD WAS MISSING AND THE ONES LEFT WERE COMPLETELY COLD. ICING ON THE CAKE WAS THE MANAGER, WHO CARRIES LOADS OF ATTITUDE AND NO COURTESY IN SPITE OF ALL THIS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT AS YOU END UP PAYING ON THE HIGHER SIDE COMPARED TO OTHER RESTAURANTS IN AND AROUND SALT LAKE. AH ! I MISSED ONE THING THE MUSIC WAS ALSO SO BORING. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS GOOD WAS THE SIKH KABAB AND THE AMBIANCE OF THE RESTAURANT. IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO ENJOY JUST THESE 2 YOU CAN TAKE IT ON....

A long wait went down in a flush.starting with the ambience.the decore and the buffet table gives you the feal of sea side.which the only two things I liked.coming to the service.after reading all the reviews we made a mind of ordering the food in a bulck as they are realt slow server.coming to the food starter started with chrispy chilli babby corn.followed by chicken & Fish dish,but what was the difference between them?they all were cooked in the same sauce.then came a fish cake which was missing the seasoning.the only thing which ok was the prawn cocktail.they didn't had any varity in the barbeque.it was just plain chicken kabab & veg.main course had varity but lacked the zing to the dish.i wanted to try the crab dish & the vindaloo which totally let down.crabs were raw inside.chickens were rock solid even a fork couldn't penitrate into it.for the first time I had to leave food on my plate & move on.so finally thought of making it up on the dessert but they were short on that,said will fill the bench but still after waiting 5 min nothing came to the bench so we helped ourselves with the left overs only.after all this they though of getting a good feedback.but when they didn't got one.their behaviour was just to die for.so finally in a short note."Never again"

I went to this place with my office colleagues for a team lunch.  We opted for the buffet but were very much disappointed with the dishes.  The starters were very less in variety and also the food quality was not upto the mark with the price. But need to mention the prawn item in the starter was tasty. Main course was also not much satisfactory. Coming to the deserts,  the gulab jamuns were cold and we all were having a feeling like waiting to be rotten type. I would not recommend this place for buffet purpose but have heard about the good sea food there though have not tried yet.

Another buffet experience but this time all alone. So no beer. Just food.
Good will be an understatement for the food and sitting.
Very good will be an overstatement for the value for money as its a bit on the higher side as per price is concerned.

Visited the restaurant twice. First time we went when the restaurant was barely launched. We took the buffet. Pretty decent, but nothing extra ordinary to mention. Second time we went for a-la-carte. This time surprisingly we got a complementary desert.

Good place... U shud try the buffet here.... They have a great spread and the buffets includes crabs, pork, fish and chicken. Starters and desserts are the best ones. Would love to visit soon. The only drawback was the occasional house flies otherwise deserved a 4.5...

Went here for a team lunch and opted for lunch buffet. Starters were good. Special mentionable is the prawn cocktail. Each member of my team liked it. The quality of the meat and fish was very good. Main course was also lovable. Deserts were nice specially baked Alaska.

After my last two visits, I told that biryani and custard is not that good but this time I have no complaints. Also, 4.5 stars this time instead of 4.

Will love to visit this place once again shortly. :)

The best thing I have eaten at this place is Lunch Buffet. Sublime quality of all the cuisines offered in the buffet (Non-veg). Eating starters at this place is like heaven. Main courses are quite good. Again the desserts are awesome. I would like to go there again just for the buffet menu. Also the atmosphere of the place is soothing.

Visited last week for our team dinner. Overall a decent place to have dinner buffet. Ambience was good and staff was prompt in service. A big bonus is having a smoking zone ;). Anyways coming to the food...

Starters: Fried corn was nice. Grilled fish items like hariyali fish tikka and salt and pepper anchovy were also pretty good. Chicken items consisted of chicken wings and kebab. Wings was great, kebab was not so good. A special mention is prawn cocktail which is a must try. It was served in shot glasses loaded with succulent prawn...just awesome.

Main Course: Nothing much to mention about the main course. Crab was just ok. Only pork vindaloo was fab and saved the day.

Dessert : Dessert was also pretty good but fell short of my expectation. Gulab jamuns were soft and tasted yum. So was baked alaska and chocolate mousse. But that was all. The other other items like banana custard and brownies were below average.
Overall, a decent place for buffet dinner outing with family or friends but nothing to be excited about. There is a great scope of improvement if better item selection is done especially for main course and desserts.

The unavoidable comparison with Barbeque Nation makes the food look average and the price a bit too much. The mutton shami kebabs were sort of coarse, and the fish not of very good quality. The prawn cocktail was good, the chicken kebabs were good. For main course, Ocean Grill has more variety than Barbeque Nation. It has a combination of Indian, Italian & Chinese. The pork was soft, the pasta was tasty, the chicken in mushroom sauce was good. The desserts were very tasty. Baked Alaska, gulab jamun, caramel custard, milkcake, fruit salad etc. Happy house continued till 11pm. Overall, good experience.

I visited Ocean Grill this afternoon to celebrate by husband's birthday. I must say I was thoroughly impressed. Customer satisfaction no doubt is their ultimate objective and they pass with flying colours. I had pre booked a table, so they gave us a complimentary b'day cake. The food was great. Am in love with their pork vindaloo. The best part was the extra efforts they make to make sure customers go back home happy. My husband and I went for the non veg buffet. For my daughter we had ordered veg noodles from the a la carte menu, but they did not charge for it! When we asked why they did not charge for it, the manager (sorry I didn't ask his name) said it was for a kid and they are not going to charge us for it. That's an extremely sweet gesture. They have a huge variety to choose from, and taste is excellent. And the staff was extremely courteous. Two thumbs up from me!  Am definitely going back again soon.

Blame your luck if u get no space at Barbeque Nation  and choose ocean grill for family dining(buffet). Stale fish...almost Fleshless crab......stale raita......
Poor quality dessert with little  choice ...miserable replenishment of servings...are just a few to spoil your meal. Their exorbitant pricing contrasts poor service and quality.I'll be the last person to peep into this place ever.

Food is too weak to tentalise the taste buds but it offers some exotic options that is I find to be nice over here.
a bit clumpsy in ambience and is a bit costly in compare to its food quantity and quality.
but I will say its sea food platter is a must try atleast once to see its varient which it offers

Only one thing was missing which was Ice Cream in the desserts section. Otherwise everything else was good.

The Sunday buffet is quite great, has a variety of dishes with the tasty ratio of 80:20. Though more fish based items on the buffet would've been welcomed. Another thing which I liked the most was the dedicated smoking area inside the restaurant. It was a small but really fine touch for the people who likes to take a puff inbetween our food. 4 stars from me.

A buffet was being planned for long, but the plan didn't materialize.¬† So when another such plan popped out, we jumped at it. Nearbuy was offering a good deal for the buffet here, and that was exactly what we needed. We had a reservation for 3 at around 1 PM. We had to spend a little time looking for parking, only to discover that Infinity also provides paid parking. Anyway, we reached around 1:30 PM only to find that we were the first people for the buffet.

The starters here are served on table.¬† For starters we had crispy babycorn, bruschetta, mourola maach bhaja, fiery chicken wings, shammi kebab, prawn cocktail and barbeque. One cannot expect everything to be great, and so was the case here too. The babycorn was simply awesome. Bruschetta was also nice. Mourola maach bhaja was a bit of disappointment as it was a bit tough, maybe because it had gone cold. The chicken wings were okayish. The shammi kebab was extremely soft but it had slight smell to it. Since, this was the first time I was having one, I was not sure if it was supposed to be that way. The things that stood out among starters had to be prawn cocktail and the barbeque. The prawn cocktail is probably their speciality, and I had only read in the reviews about how wonderful it was. And boy, it was simply delicious.¬† The barbeque had chicken tikka, fish tikka and paneer tikka. All of them were wonderful, but being ardent chicken lovers, we decided to continue with chicken tikka for further rounds.

There was a wonderful spread for the mains too. They had fish and chicken salad, which didn't look quite appetizing and hence I decided against having them.¬† Apart from that, they had chicken soup, herb rice, fish in creamy sauce, pork vindaloo, crab curry, naan, chicken with mushroom, afghani murgh, mutton biriyani and raita. The chicken soup was accompanied with breadsticks. It was plain and was a nice way to start the mains. The herb rice was also quite light. The pork vindaloo was great. The gravy was good and the pieces were also great.¬† The crab was good too. However, only crab legs were present, and hence my friends decided against having it. It would have been nice to have a mixture of crab body and leg present. Also, the gravy was a bit salty for my taste. The fish in creamy sauce was liked by my friends. However, I felt a slight smell when I had mine.¬† But it was prepared well. Extremely soft. The chicken with mushroom was nice, and so was the afghani murg. We didnt expect the mutton biriyani to be good here, but surprisingly it was. Lots of mutton pieces, each of them cooked to perfection and absolutely non-greasy. Along with the raita, the biriyani was a delightful surprise.

Although we were quite full by this time, we simply couldn't let the deserts go. I was hoping for Baked Alaska, and they had that. It would have been a sin to let that go. For deserts, I had Baked Alaska, Pudding, Profiterole, and Tiramisu. I am not a desert person, but I had to go for a second serving of Baked Alaska and the Profiterole.¬† (I am drooling even as I write this). I have had way better pudding thanks to my grandmother. And the Tiramisu was a let down for me. Simply too much coffee. 

The overall ambience is nice. Even by the time we finished, there were not many people around. The service is exceptional. Each of our questions regarding the food was answered with a smile.

Overall, a great buffet for Rs. 700.

drinks were so weird.
When we called one of their waiter, he told us that he'll provide one complementary drink but after sometime they refused
Deserts were finished and they were not refilling it.Main course had only 3 items in veg.

Food Taste: 8/10

Value for Money: 8/10

Ambiance: 9/10

Variety: 9/10

The city can never have too many themed restaurants, that also focus on the quality of food.

My most recent visit to this joint was for a team lunch (been having quite a few of those lately, so it's easier to compare) and we enjoyed the buffet.

While the quality of the Kebab starters will compare unfavorably to the BBQ Nation across the street, the range of the mains and staples more than make up for it. On the whole, we snagged everything from Fish and Prawns, to Chicken, Mutton and Pork, with Crab making a guest appearance. The featured staples included Noodles, Lemon Rice and Biriyani. Even the Veg items were decent, but not really worth a lot of mention from a dedicated meat-lover.

The dessert section looked pretty extensive, but I got hung up on a very well made Caramel Custard. For what it's worth, the folks with me say that the rest of the stuff was pretty good too.

There's only one thing I'd have liked to be better... the speed of service during the starters. It's a tad irritating to have your taste-buds tingling but your stomach growling... while it takes an age for the Prawn Cocktail to return.

The ambience is good but the food is not upto expectation. The food displayed here and the one served is not the same. The food quality is still not upto the mark. When we visit a Buffet restaurant the expectations are on variety and there was hardly any variety in the dishes apart from Chicken. Only the chicken dishes were good. Whereas being the name Ocean Grill, you expect better seafood including Prawns, variety of fishes etc.

The main course had everything from pasta to noodles to afghani chicken. The restaurant was crowded but comfortable. The behavior if staffs were nice.  Only thing is staffs need to be trained a little more on serving and communication skill. I just loved the experience.

I visited this joint during last pujo, even though, the rush wasn't as much as I had expected (probably because it was a dry day :/)

Ocean grill has reached the status of all stars when it comes to seafood. The interiors of the restaurant with fish nets, wooden fishes and miniature crabs, sets up the mood for having authentic sea food platters!
We ordered their signature seafood platter (it's quite expensive, close to 1k with tax), squid in butter garlic sauce, and for starters and drinks, we ordered chicken wings, virgin mojito and blue lagoon.

The seafood platter had a variety which very hard to get in Kolkata. It had jumbo prawns, tiger prawns, calamari, squid, crabs, basa, octopus, oysters and what not. It was served with mashed potato and garlic bread. The squid, cooked in butter garlic sauce was also really good but the quantity was not so filling. Apart from these two, there was nothing so special about the chicken wings or the drinks that we had, it was standard.

In nutshell, ocean grill will definitely put a hole in your pocket, but the food along with the ambience will make up for that!

To be true, I didn't have high hopes from this place but thought of giving it a try. Visited with twelve others for their lunch buffet. The reception was very warm and welcoming. The mood was perfect and the decor rang true to the naming of the place. 
In the menu, these are the ones I liked:
Starters- crispy baby corn, American sweet corn(loved the smoked flavor), prawn cocktail(served in cute shot glasses), BBQ-d veggies, fish and chicken were quintessentially how they should be. 
I was disappointed with the reluctance of the waiters to bring in more bbq sticks.

Main course- Liked the thai vegetable curry and biryani.
I have to mention that most of the dishes like palak paneer, pork vindaloo, corn gratin, missed the mark.

Among the desserts, the baked alaska, caramel pudding, chocolate profiteroles stood out.

A good thing was that on request, we were provided a complimentary cake as we were bidding farewell to a friend. The overall experience was thus a mixed bag and I would think twice before revisiting the place.

Visited this place after I guess 4 years.. as the time changes so the items they offers..
Now quite a decent buffet they offered. We went there for lunch buffet.
Starters:
_______________
Fried sweet corn : owsum, yes better than bbq one ;)
Crispy chili baby corn : pretty good
Chichken wings: very good
Pan cake : not the sweet one. Shape like that, okay type
Now they offer on the grill items, bt yes no near to the the opposite place of the restaurant.
Fish kebab : very poor, very disappointed 
Chicken kebab: great in taste
Veg kebab: very poor

Main course:
________________
Plenty they offer. Yes it tastes good
Afgani murg, mutton biriyani, crab, pork, there was another chichken item.
All are very good. I found the pork just fab.

Tried some veg items too. There were 6 veg items including pasta. Potol dorma was exceptionally good.

Dessert:
---------------------------
With out no doubt the best part.
Gulab jaumn, caramel custard, baked Alaska, fresh fruits, 3 type cakes. Profiteroles, mango mouse.

Yess all are good.. standout for me : caramel custard and baked Alaska, and all the cakes... 

And they offered a complementary drink, we opted for fresh lime soda.

Cost : 650+tax = 820 around per person

Now coming to rating: I thought of given it as 3.5, but the extra 0.5 only for their some main course and desert items.

A small suggestions to management: do improve your starter quality, u have the big giants just opposite u offer better with this amount of buffet price.

But yes much improved from last time.. keep improving:)

Though I've heard a lot of negative feedback regarding this place however my experience was pretty amazing. Went for a team lunch with colleagues. The service was prompt. The decor was simple yet decent. The starters were served by the staffs and the main course was self serviced. Loved the wide range of vegetarian as well as non vegetarian starters. All of them were enough tasty. My only complaint is that the serving wasn't generous enough. There was a wide range of Chinese as well as Indian items to be chosen from, for the main course, both in vegetarian and non-vegetarian section. Loved the shorba, fish in lemon butter, noodles, chicken and mutton items. The mixed seafood platter was tasty but the crabs in the platter were too small to be fleshy enough. The selection of desserts were very nice and tempting. Overall it was a good experience. Expected more options for sea food though.

Description : Before starting my review, just want to tell everyone sorry for not writing a complete review, as I had not option but to leave the place in the middle of the meal because of their poor service.
It was a Sunday evening. Went there after watching movie at adlabs just opposite the restaurant. We were greeted well. Was explained the pricing and the menu spread. Liked the whole thing and decided to try it out. Just when we sat, disasters starts. 
We are pure vegetarian. We mentioned that in the beginning. So we were expecting some good veg starters. We waited for 10min to get our 1st starter which was mini pizza. But it was not served hot. Then we were served few more starters but it were served in good gaps which increased our starvation. We were not happy with the service, still we liked the spread so were ok with it. Then few more incidents happened and it added to our wounds. 
We were offered thrice non veg starters even though we cleared each time that we are pure vegetarian. It pissed us off. Then we asked for repeat of mushroom item. We were informed that it is finished. How can an item be said to be finished if I have opted for buffet. Above that we were not offered a replacement dish for it. We then asked for the bill, we just wanted to pay for the bill and go out. When I communicated my bad experience with the manager and asked for the bill, he just said no no and went away without completing the communication. It just blew me. He just went to front desk and stood there. After 5 minuted, I went there and asked for the bill again. He said ok giving. He took out the bill, gave it to me and asked me to pay. When I saw the bill, it was of zero amount. I was like what is it? He said this is the bill. I got the feeling that he made fun of me.
It was a terrible experience. Manager's behaviour was unacceptable. Not going to this place again.

Again, a very fine restaurant. Serving you pan Asian delicacies. I loved how the served the things on the buffet spread, plating up was visually attractive and amazingly tasty. The only thing I disliked was the seafood soup, there was a weird smell, though I have had seafood soup at other places, and never felt so. Coming to desserts, strawberry shortcake, ice cream counter, and the little sponge cakes with jello, absolutely delicious :)

Before even I start about food, ocean grill has redefined service in this industry. Each and every member of the crew is super courteous as well as welcoming. My 10 months old son was with me and they took the initiative to take him around the restaurant so that we can have our food freely and made our pre anniversary lunch special. Coming to food, we chose buffet and it was a great spread. Around six starters including chicken and fish kebabs in live barbecue. Special mention of the shrimp dish, it was awesome. The main course had loads to offer starting from ghost biriyani to herb rice to fish in mustard cream gravy, crab, pork vindaloo, roasted chicken in mushroom gravy and super delicious murgh afghani. All the foods were great except the fish prep which was a little salty. The dessert spread was also good inland included three types of cakes, custard, fruit salad, gulab jamun, baked alaska, caramel custard. And trust me, all were yum. All came for 650+ taxes. Worth a revisit.

The first thing that catches your eye when you enter Ocean Grill is the jelly-fish shaped lights and fishing nets. It sets the tone for what's to follow. The food is really good. The portions served are generous. Don't miss the Devilled Crabs. They are simply delicious. The service is prompt and efficient. A really nice place to unwind after office hours and spend a quality evening with friends and family.

Please its a request for vegetarians not to go to thus restaurant. Please please. I had gone with my family and to my surprise everything served on d table for starters were stale and cold... And the soup was CHILLED but the waitor insisted it was HOT. Again on request when we said we wanted a hot soup the same was given to us after 15 mins. The american corn were smelling bad. The panned tikka was hard as a rubber. The pizza was hard and the cheese was uncooked. And then the babycorns were sweet. The main course was as cold as it could be and they wanted us to have bhindi with nan... Omg I love that combination ... Out of the world the staff is very polite and the food is as bad as good the staff is. The rice was like two days stale ones... Then the dessert were like brownie was very very hard . only the icecream was good. Why the hell did I visit this restaurant. To add to it I had food poisoning the very same night and I had to call the doc on an emergency issue... I was on a liquid diet for two days ... Please save yourself from this restaurant

I visited this place yesterday night for our quarterly team dinner.We arrived at this place at 7 pm and were greeted by the staff who showed us to our seats.The first thing that struck me was the ambience, everything was related to the ocean life including decorations on floor.The lights hanging above were made in jellyfish design.There was even an aquarium at the corner.The restaurant was very spacious.

Coming to the food, first we were asked for a drink from among mirinda,pepsi,aam pana and 7up.After that the starters started arriving.There was meat pie,pizza,chilli baby corn,another corn dish,chicken wings.Not to forget the prawn cocktail.For the grill there was chicken,fish and paneer. The meat pie was tasty it was crunchy loaded with chicken inside.I liked the corn and chicken wings best,the corn was crispy and crunchy.The chicken wings had the right blend of flavour and was amazing.The kebabs were also juicy and soft. Their special dish prawn cocktail was tasty and served in small shot glass.It was loaded with mayonnaise and prawns.For the kebab I didn't like the paneer it wasn't that soft.

Coming to the main course,there was an assortment of food both in veg and non veg counter.I visited the non veg one so writing for it.There was mutton biriyani,fried rice,soup,chiekcn with mushrooms,pork,crab,fish in mustard creamy sauce,chicken and fish salad.The biriyani was light and the mutton pieces in it was soft and juicy.They melted in my mouth.The fried rice was plain without my taste.The pork tasted more like mutton.The standout for me was the chicken and crab.The chicken was light with mushrooms and had a sweet taste to it whereas the crab was a little spicy but tasted awesome.I didn't taste the salads as I was already full.

Coming to dessert there was also an assortment of food like fruits,baked Alaska (which everyone jumped into), caramel custard,brownie,banana cake,chocolate mousse in a cup,gulab jamun and another dish which was a small round pastry topped with chocolate sauce. I didn't try much desserts as I am not so much into sweets but I like the gulab jamun which was soft.The brownie was a little dry but yummy.The banana cake was a let down.Baked Alaska and chocolate mousse was really tasty,i didn't try it but got reviews for it from rest of my colleagues.

Lastly they had arranged a cake (as we has requested)for us to cut to celebrate few of our colleagues birthday.So it was really amazing.
Overall it was a good affair with some really good food.A mention to the the staff for their courteous behavior and prompt service.Hoping to drop there soon enough :)

Nothing Extraordinary, to be honest. Went there yesterday. Decided for a buffet seeing their large array of delicacies.

There were around 7-8 starters apart from the grills among which I found, the prawn cocktail and the chicken wings being the best. Grills were okay. Among the mains, there was a total of 8 items of which I tried out the Chicken Salad, Pork Vindalho with Naan and Mutton Biriyani. The chicken salad was too much dry to my liking. I loved the Pork Vindalho but again the Mutton Biriyani was nothing spectacular. Now, off to deserts, there were a total of 6 different types of desserts. The desserts were kind of good. The staff was pretty corteous and well mannered.

Now the things which I didn't like at all. Although, it was mentioned it was a happy hour(Buy 2 Get 1 Free), on enquiring, it was told us to us that they don't follow happy hours anymore. It's okay, if they have stopped following Happy Hours. But they should stop displaying the fact that happy hours is apllicable. Also, we did not get anything complementary with the buffet, not a soft drink even.

On a whole, an average experience. I would not visit again. But yes, worth visiting for someone, who loves varieties. They have tonnes of varieties on their menu.

Went there for a team dinner. Among the starters prawn cocktail is worth a mention but others were okayish. In main course the biriyani was awesome and there was a fish in cream sauce that was delicious. But my favourite part was the desserts. The chocolate mousse was an absolute delight. The baked Alaska gulab jamun is also worth a mention. Service was quite satisfactory. Lastly this place has an interesting decor which adds to the fine dining experience

Heaven's tore up when we visited this restaurant in an afternoon with my close friend who is also a food fanatic. We got really heartiest welcome from the waiters who steered us through a large assortment of never-ending starter. I personally loved the American corn and Prawn cocktail and Mutton pie. The fiery wings and Kabab was really good and within a short time we fell in love with the food. I thanked my friend for suggesting such a good place of sea food. Although I was much surprised to find Biryani in the main course. It doesn't correspond with the sea food at all. The Crab Curry was a delight. Maincourse is good enough. Desserts was also very very good with lot of options. A nice visit for both of us. A point to note for management people, we were not served Crab during our second visit and also do not serve cold drinks in the name of welcome drink. I am rating 3.5 only for a neglected Maincourse. Please, improve. Otherwise a strong recommendation for specialised sea-foods.

Famous for its seafood specialities, Ocean Grill didnt impress me much on my first visit. The dinner buffet spread along with the starters doesnt lives upto the promise. The slow service of starters adds to the pain. The taste of food is good but not delicious. Ambience has resemblence of ocean and the staff is courteous but not swift. They serve some specialities like Prawn Cocktail, Pork Vindaloo, Crab sweet & sour. Dinner buffet costs 700 INR all inclusive.

I am very happy that I spent this very important evening in Ocean Grill. Moreover, the food and the ambience were also very nice. I am also very impressed with their hospitality.

Till now the best seafood restaurant i came across, wonderful ambiance and great food. They don't only serve great seafood but they also serve great indian,Chinese food,m y personal favorite is grill lobster with spicy salsa . Service is fast and there is a door man to notify you about seatings and bookings.  Ambiance is great and it has the cosy fine dining atmosphere . A good restaurant for family, friends, colleague and of course the food lovers of kolkata. The prices of the food items are budget friendly, hope they keep up the good work and serve more foods for foodies like me.

Hmm i don't knw frm where to start. Well the staffs are really good, the ambiance was great, attached room for smoking(as im a smoker :P). If you are an alcoholic plz visit the restaurant b4 8pm, as there happy hours ends @8, you will get a drink free with 2,. Basically 3drinks at the price of 2.
And special drinks combos are there too which i really appreciate.
Coming to the food -
Starters - we ordered french fries, crispy babycorn & a hariyali chicken kabab or something like that i didn't exactly remember the name, frenchfries & crispy babycorn was nice, i personally didnt liked the kabab much, i was craving for some more spice in it.

Main course - Butter nan, chicken tikka butter masala, mixed fried rice, monogolian chilli chicken.. oh god! Each n every dish was so nicely cooked cnt expln,. Tikka butter masala was a worthy try.

Desserts - mocktail & gulab jamun, i lost somewhere after having the gulab jamun. :D too good.

A must visit. üëç

Lunch at Ocean's Grill was a very good decision by me and my collegues since we couldnt a reservation in BBQ Nation. The buffet begins with 8 itemsa of chicken , fish and 1 pie which almost took care of my appetite. However the main course dishes were quite surprising, baked fish and crabs were delicious and pork was very well cooked. The biriyani is not so good , infact biriyani seemed a bit odd-one-out . The desserts were very good , especially the mousse and apple pie were fantastic. Will surely visit again.

WORST BUFFET PLACE EVER!!!!
Zomato snatched away the chance of giving 0 rating to this restaurant.
I went there with 3 of my friends and had buffet.We had to wait for almost 1.5 hour just for the first round of serving of starters.During that our plates were empty for 20 25 minutes for two times.
Veg starters were below average,and buffet had nothing for vegetarians and the deserts were just for name.
Worst of all,behaviour of the staff.Even after complaining again and again they were quite neglecting in attitude.
I will never visit that place again.Opt for barbeque nation at comparable price or any food stall at webel more.

It was eeriely empty for a Tuesday afternoon, which made me doubt whether all the decisions i took,¬† while awaiting my turn in long queues of barbq nation in the opposite side and seeing this restaurant's name, that to wait for what I am there,¬† is correct. But I was to be proved wrong. The decor is very much soothing, starters are well spread and nicely cooked(so well cooked that I gulped down a lot of small fishes, which I normally avoid)..main course buffet is very well spread and specially to mention the crab dish which is among the rarest in these days in city restaurants. The only con which I found was that there were no bengali or indian dessert available in the sweet section, but that does not undermine the beautiful rum balls and brownies and puddings which were offered. Thumbs up for me, as I find a big relief from standing in the long queues of bar bqnation.

Yet another Giant fails to impress..........Read On.

Pax : 3 (1 Me and 2 Mangalvari Brathdhaari,so they don‚Äôt count)

Nicely done, clean flatware and cutlery. Some of the wrappings along the legs of the table has started to come off though. Nice ambiance and very cool touch with the aquariums. The fisherman's net over the buffet boat table was interesting.

For starters I had ordered for the Salt & Pepper Mixed Seafood. The description read ‚Äú fried salt & pepper fried fish, squid, octopus and crab meat served w‚Äô house salad and tartare sauce‚Äù.

You would expect to be served atleast what‚Äôs put down in the menu, right? Nooooo...No way.
¬†Served on bed of shredded lettuce came fried octopus, squid and prawns, a la Prawn Cocktail style.¬†Tartare Sauce...Chef definitely needs to read his Larousse, cause that was no sauce tartare. What was served was a bland, blob of mayonnaise speckled with unidentifiable bits of kitchen scraps.
¬†¬†

Yesssss....you read it right, prawns...they were succulent and perfectly cooked. They were sweet and had the right amount of bite but here is my problem, they were not in the menu description.
The octopus was very nicely done, though the squid was quite forgettable. By the way no crab meat or fish. Surprised? ¬†

Well I was surprised too. Asked for the Restaurant Manager and was abruptly told that he was busy.
¬†Saying sorry for bad food, does not change my lost appetite.¬†

For Mains, had ordered Fish & Chips with Salad. The description read ‚Äú Beer battered fried fish served with FAT chips, salad greens and tartare sauce‚Äù. After an eternal wait, finally it was served on the table. Guess the Chef had overcooked the previous batch, just a guess for his sake.

Lets start at the FAT fries, they must be joking. These are the standard frozen fries, which were unceremoniously plopped into the deep fat fryer. Some were underdone, some were overdone to the point of being hollow from inside.

Fish, and I hate to say, this almost made me puke. Basa! now why would you serve this horrible thing. Under seasoned and under-done, makes me want to throw up while I write this review. Now we all know what happens when we plonk a piece of frozen Basa into the deep fryer. The fish has an odd slimy texture if it is undercooked, and that is exactly what I was served.

The crust was under seasoned and lacked any character whatsoever. The beer batter if done properly, results in an airy yet crispy coating. This was none of the above.

Chef, please understand the science that goes into finishing your dish before you serve it to your patrons. I had to leave the restaurant with a hot horrible taste in my mouth. If you are going to charge INR 400 for fried fish, least you can do is to ensure that you serve palatable and dignified food.

Team Ocean Grill, you were tested and found wanting. Dont play with Classics (Fish & Chips) if you cant execute them flawlessly.

Set up an R&D kitchen, inspire your Kitchen Staff and they will deliver inspiring food.

Till we meet again...this is a feedback, there is no bad feedback.

Excellent decor, nice ambiance but the food was average. Overpriced! A special mention for the tiramisu cheesecake which was the best part of the desserts. Overall the experience was nice.

Good food... however feedback provided by customer not taken positively by the staff members... would have rated 4 but because of un-supportive behaviour would rate the half of it... as its not always the food that people want.. but the end to end product which matters.

One of my favourite place in Kolkata...been there few times..opted their lunch buffet..from starters to desserts everything were awesome...the kebabs that they served were so soft and mouthwatering..specially the small crabs...really remarkable...in main course the items were really well prepared..but I think it must be better if they provide any type of special nun items like kulcha.or butter nan etc....talking about ambience..its really havoc...quite spacious..all the stuffs are so courteous..but i also think that to compete with jaisalmer.chai break.bbq narion it  just need small improvement..although experience was so cool....

I went to dis place wid my friends fr a bday treat few days back.. Nd was delighted by their buffet spead.
There were near about 8 spreads fr starters ranging from hariyali nd tikka chicken kebab to fish reshmi kebab,mutton puff, chkn wings nd some more bt d prawn cocktail was a total surprise.
In d main course we had dishes like chkn afghani, fish in cream mustard sauce, mutton biriyani, pork, spicy crab and some more to name.
Last but not d least..dey provided us wid a wide range of desserts of whch baked Alaska melted our taste buds
We were a lil dissappointed wid the vegetarian main course though the overall dining experience was really nice üòä

Staff's behaviour- 5/5
Starter- 5/5
Main course- 4/5
Dessert- 4/5
Really easy to find, located just opposite to the RDB Boulevard.
From the moment you step into this place it feels like you have entered a ship. The whole place is themed to give you a feel of the ocean thus the name Ocean Grill. Buffet is placed on the miniature ship and the plates are kept in the anchor section of the ship. Above which hangs a fish net in this you can see various shells. The lights are decorated like jelly fish. On the wall you can see a large shark which looks simply awesome. There are 3 aquariums near the bar section, one of which has a really nice nice looking fish (other fishes are good too but this one is exceptional with a big head. U can find it in my pics). On the floor octopus pic is printed.

We tried Dinner buffet. So lets start with the starter. I should give it 6 out of 5. Every single item was yummy. Specially the mourala fry, pangas tangra barbecue and the prawn cocktail. The concept of the prawn cocktail was just wow. Plus there was a welcome drink too.

Moving on to the main course, I was really tired till I got there after eating so much of those yummy starters. Still I tried. Prawns in the prawn curry were big enough. A white fish was there, forgot the name but it was the best in the main course menu. Biriyani was so so. There was pork too if u would like to taste it. Raita, russian salad all tasted good.¬†

Coming to last category ie the dessert. It was not great but was good. What it lacked was ice cream. There was gulab jamun, pastry, custard, cake , fruit salad and even tea.
Overall it was really a nice experience. A place worth visiting if u love the sea and its food.

Restaurant's ambience is good. Starters are really delicious. But the main course items are really bad. I could get the stale smell from the chicken dishes. Beriyani quality is not up to the mark. Desserts are good.

Overall very good experience.

Nice environment with good decoration. This is my second visit @ Ocean Grill. Food lovers can enjoy buffet as this restaurant offers unlimited food with 2:1 drink (Happy Hour from 12 noon to 7p.m). The buffet is 650 + taxes. and A La Cart will cost approx Rs.1600 for two. Beer range starts from Rs.145 (330ml).

From a very far off place, we went to Ocean Grill today on dinner in search of an exclusive seafood platter. Unfortunately enough, we were thoroughly disappointed. I came across a number of good reviews abt the place here on Zomato and thought to give it a try. Now I wish, we should have landed to the Bar B Q Nation just opposite to this place.
Though they have named the restaurant 'Ocean Grill', a very few seafood delicacies are on the buffet menu. Not so sure about the a la carte. But the buffet did not have even crab in it. 
Starting from the starters, they have ample options but do not satisfy your tastebuds. Their prwan cocktail is a sort of okeyish but other starters are not at all up to the mark. At least on a weekend buffet, they should have arranged something good.
In the main course again, you have plenty of choices and this time the flavors of foods are a way better than the starters. However, the star attraction dishes like prawn curry, green thai curry, chicken in white mushroom sauce and mutton biriyani taste really bland.
In the dessert section, did not find anything flavorful apart from the caramel custard and mango pestry.  Even the lovely creamy pofiteroles were so dull in taste..donno,but sorry they fail to impress foodies like us!

P:S Have some of their staffs newly joined? I mean they are as slow as turtles while serving..and was serving a miserly portion every time..had to wait much for the second help! The only good thing, they offered my one year old baby a mango juice at free of cost. Of course, thanks for that.
Overall impression:Needs gross improvement at all sides!

Nothing ocean about this place. Usually remains empty. Chicken and Mutton both were not at all well cooked. Moreover they are charging double of MRP cost on bottle of water. When questioned, they are insisting on some cock and bull story of establishment cost. If you want good food, don't even look at this place. Try BBQ nation or the punjabi restaurant opposite to this

My experience yesterday was not-so-good partly because of the food we chose and partly because of the service we received.

‚Ä¢ To start with, we ordered Virgin Mojito and Forever Young from mocktails menu. Both were very good, though after a sip I realized the second is not my kind.

‚Ä¢ Then in the starter we had Harrissa Grilled Chicken. It is a less spicy item though tests very good. The cabbage and capsicum are for garnishing purpose only, unlike some other restaurants where they cook them too. The chicken could be more juicy and soft.

‚Ä¢ In the main course we tried lobster for the first time which was disheartening. I have never seen people having lobster in restaurants in Kolkata. The creatures came in really small sizes, their edible part is hardy as large as a medium size shrimp. They serve it with selection of sauce and selection of sides. You can have any two sides from the menu. Lobster flesh tests good but quantity is too low to compensate Rs.650.

‚Ä¢ Lastly we had Pannacota in dessert which was okay.

Our bill came with service tax charged 2 times. Correcting which wasted 10 more minutes.

Moreover, an additional 7% service charge was added to the bill which I am not sure was mentioned in the menu.

Overall, we was not very happy and satisfied when we were leaving the restaurant. This restaurant is definitely not in my "visit again" list.

Second time visit with friends. I did not expect a lot , but the variety in menu caught me by surprise. They had prawn cocktail , meat pie as starters, which is a break-away from the normal buffet dining protocol. Taste wise I would say they have come a long way since my last visit , but still some scope of improvement. The maincourse for non veg was also aplenty ..but nothing seemed strikingly good to me ,all were eatable ,decently made. The desserts were stellar. Service good too !! Had a nice time

I got a decent deal from the app "Little" for this place. Served good starters - chicken, fish, mutton. For main course, there was crab + which did not taste aa expected. Desserts were good. Gulab jamuns were like really tasty.
Ambiance - okayish - the place is spacious, they have nice lamps. The bar area is very well lighted up.

I have been here for the last 3 weeks. Have felt in love with the place,hence have been here for 3 consecutive days. The ambience,the comfortable seats and most importantly the music... They are just awesome. Have personally spoken to the chef and owner,Shawn.. He has done a marvellous job, and has been extremely good and kind to us. 
Now coming to the food: the menu looks excellently balanced with a lot of sea food options,well distributed throughout the menu. The buffet looked great,I found crab,something very rare we find in buffets in Kolkata. The presentation was superbly done, since I am a great fan of squids and octopus I went for the squid. But to me the food came very well presented in a wine glass, however I felt they must work out on the portioning part. 
The menu I found was a little overpriced, buts that's sometimes okay when you find other things such great.
Willing to hold a party there very soon... And hope to be there around again.

We had been there for an office party last week.... however ambience, service d√©cor was very good, liked the atmosphere and good service, but when it comes to food you guys really need to do better, starter's were nice but the main cource and desserts are not good at all, we went with some clients we felt ember raced with their comments also, biriyani and grill chicken with mushroom was only good item in main cource, noodles was not good and fresh but the worst part was the desserts. Other than the ice cream rest was very poor. I would never recommend Ocean'sGrill to anyone. Especially if visiting with their clients. You guys let me down man..!!!

Nothing great there is party going on which is more horrible to enjoy food . Compare to Barbeque Nation and Sigree this place is awful we will never visit again any more. Very less spread of main course too. I was so keen to visit this restaurant after going thru their website but it was too disheartening. If they want good clients who loves to taste foods should take care of their buffer spreads along with their desserts

The rating was just above the threshold limit due to the ambiance. The buffet had many lined items but the cooking was really unsatisfactory. What I liked was the crab ,with hardly any flesh. The pork was really over cooked. Had to improve much to draw more customers for standing erect just beside BBQ. I love the hospitality.

This restaurant is located just behind my husband's former office. Their team used to frequent this restaurant often for team lunches and dinners. So one day I was adamant about trying this out. First and foremost, this is one place you should visit if you have a good appetite. There are lots of barbecued items on offer. Apart from that you also have options for main course spread. However, I felt full after the kebabs itself. The price includes a complimentary beverage. Food and service are satisfactory.

We decided to celebrate Christmas on 27th December (Sunday) as we were too busy on 25th. So, we chose BBQ nation to treat ourselves. We reached there around 7:50 pm and it was disheartening to see more than 20 people already standing in the queue.
We were very hungry and at last zomato came to our rescue and we found out 'Ocean Grill'. It is situated in a isolated mall kind of a building opposite to BBQ nation with 1-2 more restaurants. As we entered, we found only one table occupied. The staff members behaved very well and welcomed us with a smile. We went for the Special Christmas Buffet priced at Rs.1500 per person (approximately) , with tax.

Soon after we were seated, a grill was set up on the table where skewers of different kebabs were placed.
1) Chicken Malai Tikka Kebab (3.5/5) : The Chicken tikkas were good. Some were soft and some were a bit tough to tear but anyhow the flavours were spot on! Really good.

2) Fish Kebabs (4/5) : The fish kebabs were great! Soft and 'melt in the mouth' texture was really really pleasing to the taste buds. It was not really an authentic fish tikka kebab that we are familiar to, rather it's base was made up of mustard. Quite interesting!

3) The vegetarian skewer (1.5/5) : I was very, very disappointed with the vegetarian skewers. The vegetarian counterpart of kebabs consisted of paneer, potatoes and mushrooms. All the three elements had not taste whatsoever. The quality of the products were good, though. They were not stinky or stale.

Next, I was totally blown away with the chinese/continental starters! They were super yum.
4) Chicken Pot Pie Bites (4.5/5) : Chicken shreds mixed with a creamy buttery sauce placed on top of a flaky and even more buttery puff pastry cups. These bite sized cute looking appetizers were amazing. I almost ate 5-6 of them.

5) Prawn Cokctail (4.5/5) : The prawn cocktail was really good too. Very refreshing. Served cold with good amount of fresh boiled shrimps and other required crunchy vegetables (bell peppers and cabbage mainly).The prawns and the other components were mixed well with a huge dallop of thousand island dressing and served in cute small glasses! There was correct balance of all the flavours.

6)Crispy American Corn (4.8/5) : Whenever I used to read the description about "Crispy American Sweet Corn" at any Restaurant, the idea of fried sweet corn bits did not quite excite me. So, this was the first time I was having it. And was I impressed? Ofcourse I was! Super flavourful, super crispy and super good! I cannot even describe how good it was.

7)Crispy Chilli Babycorn (3.2/5) : Crispy Chilli babycorn is always my first choice for vegan starters at a chinese restaurant. The ones served here were a bit soggy. Had it been crunchy, it would have accompanied the sweet and sticky sauce wonderfully.

After these, we were served with something unexpected and it took us quite some time to recognise the taste.

8) Crispy Chilli Fish (4.5/5) : Long strips of fried crisp fish coated in a glazed sweet and spicy soy sauce. The taste was somewhat between that of a prawn and a fish. We finally realised that the fish used was Sardine (or, Khaira most probably). The fish was fried to an extent were the small bones were crisp enough to bite in and swallow! One amazing innovation, I must say.

So the average rating of the starters 3.985 ~ 3.9

We were also served with our choice of complementary drink. We went for the fresh lime soda (sweet) and it was very refreshing. (4/5)
Their main course comprised of a medley of dishes which had a little bit of some of all the cuisines to which we all are familiar with.

9) Vegetarian Hakka Noodles (3.8/5) : The noodles were well tossed with all the seasonings accompanied by thinly sliced julienned vegetables which retained their crunch after being cooked and that is what I liked.

10) Roasted Duck 1.5/5 : The duck looked very exciting but the meat was itself very unusual to taste. I have had duck before and I know what it tastes like. But, here, the duck meat was not kind of edible to me. However the sauce in which it was cooked was very flavourful. Another astonishing thing was that there was no crispy skin on the duck! This was not at all acceptable.

11) Crispy Turkey (4/5) : After my experience with the duck meat, I was skeptical about eating the turkey but thank god I tried it. It made up for the bad taste of the duck. The turkey was crispy and then sauted with some spices and tomatoes to make it juicy. Absolutely reslished eating the turkey meat which had absorbed all the lovely flavours.

12) Grilled Chicken Salad (3.9/5) : The grilled chicken salad was an interesting game played by them but it was pretty good. It was nothing but Iceberg cabbage and pieces of chicken tikka malai kebab tossed with some dressing. Loved munching on it.

13) Pork Vindaloo (0.5/5) : The first mouthful of pork meat and the first thought that came to my mind was - "Is it even pork? Is it even a vindaloo correctly made?". Pork vindaloo is something way different from the one we had here. It almost felt like mutton curry mixed with some low grade pork. But this may just be my opinion.

14)Chicken Bharta (3/5) : The chicken bharta was average to taste. The tinge of the sourness that came from the yoghurt (most probably) was nice.

15) Mutton Biryani (4.4/5) : The mutton biryani was very good. It had independent grains of rice with flavourful and well cooked, hence soft potatoes (yaay!). The mutton meat was tender and of very good quality as well.

16) Vegetables in a cantonese style sauce.(3.4/5) : Different kind of Vegetables (babycorn, carrots, beans, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc) in a sauce of consistency lying between thick and thin. Went well with the noodles.

17) Palak Paneer (2.5/5) : The overall dish needed more flavour and seasonings. The paneer was however very soft and fresh.

18)Stir fried vegetables (3.5/5) : The vegetables were cut equally in size and hence were cooked properly. The vegetables were not raw but retained their crunch.

19) Veg Pasta in arrabiata sauce (3.8/5): They used fusilli pasta instead of Penne but I personally feel that penne would have been a lot better. The pasta was not al-dente but was quite enjoyable with the arrabiata sauce.

20) Potato Gratin (3.6/5): Layers of seasoned thin potatoes baked with cream and cheese. The edges of the potatoes had crisped up and that is what I really liked. The texture was excellent since it was buttery and tasted nice too.

21) Fish in lemon butter sauce (1/5) : They used basa and they forgot to season it well. Therefore the result? - Tasteless block of fish. The lemon butter sauce was also too watery for my palate.

22) Russian salad (4/5): Excellent.

23) Crab masala (4.2/5): The crab masala was indeed mouthwatering. Perfect use of spices with perfect seasonings. Loved the crabs along with the masala.

There were also other items from the main course which we did not try and they were : Dal, Dhokar Dalna, Jeera rice, Fish salad and 2 more salads.
And a soup which did not look much appetising to us.

The main course averaged out to 3.06

We were now almost ready to hit the dessert section which looked so very decadent.

24)Profiteroles (4.7/5) : Perfectly baked crisp Profiteroles filled with whipped cream and topped with nutella. OH MY GOD! How can this go wrong? Loved every bit of it.

25) Dry fruit cake with custard sauce (4/5) : The flavours of the cake was so christmas-y. It had a hint of ginger which surprisingly accompanied the flavours of the cake so well. And when combined with the custard there was an explosion of flavours!

26) Chocolate Slice (3.8/5): Moist and gooey at the same time. Nice!

27) Caramel Custard (4/5): The caramel custard had a very nice caramel layer on top with equally nice and not-too-sweet buttery base.

28) Strawberry slice (3.5/5) : Nice and soft sponge cake with a hint of strawberries.

29) Orange slice (0.5/5) : This was the only disappointment. It was not a cake but a slice of dense wobbly mousse textured piece. Had a very artificial orange flavoured. Not good at all.

22) Gulab Jamun (4/5) : Bit too sweet for my liking but they were still hot when I ate it and was immersed in ghee (clarified butter).

So, the desserts average out to 3.8

Verdict.
Ambience : 3.8/5
Staff Behavior : 4/5
Value for money : 3.5/5
Food taste : 3.58/5

Would I recommend this place? Of course! Its a good place for a one time visit. Enjoy. :)

Happy eating.

Food is pretty good and so is the ambience and service. But be forewarned that you should not try the Burmese cuisine - really BAAAD. The Biryani also was not good - they use too much attar (food essence/scent) which really spoils the taste and smell

I had heard mixed reviews for Ocean Grill. Visited few months back for a KFF Group meet and I must say I loved the food. The starter kebabs on the grill were really good, the meat tender and spicy. A special mention for the Prawn cocktail which was the best part of the starters. It was presented in a shot glass very tangy and fresh. There were so many items on the main course that I couldn't decide which to have. Stuffed myself with the prawn thai curry and the spicy crabs. Thai curry was well cooked and flavourful and the crabs fiery. There was fish in mustard sauce which was well seasoned. My friends loved the dessert which I was too full to eat. 
Overall a very hearty meal. And I plan to return and taste the rest of the menu. Meat lovers and seafood lovers must visit.

Located in sector 5. This resturant serves decent Indian :) the chicken iranian kebab was nice... Though I found them a little hard. The disaster was the main course.. Really oily and the mutton roman josh served to me smelled bad. I liked their paneer tikka but. Would not go back if I have other options around :(

Very Average & overpriced ! Nothing special.¬†
This place is visited mainly for office parties. It's right opposite to the barbecue nation . Enter bytes food court and go to the first floor. Buffet is nothing special. Chicken and fish items are so so. Prawn cocktail was nice. The main disappointment is the service. You have to wait a long for the starters to arrive. Main course included pork which was not good in taste. Chicken murg was pathetic. Dessert was ok.

Finally I got an opportunity to visit Ocean Grill and boy they have a serious problem with their food. Starting with the starters all the items were merely dipped in salt and either fried or put on the table grill. Especially the fish tikka which never tasted like one and also the anchovies which was way too salty. The prawn cocktail lacked good prawn. Going to the main course the chicken was too simple and tasteless the pork was inedible the Biriyani was never a dum Biriyani instead it tasted like fried rice with mutton. The crab was okay but I found a nylon thread in my crab which was really a big turn off and every thing else can be cooked way better. Now the desserts well nothing deserves a special mention and they were serving baked alaska which didn't look like it neither tasted like one.. If you are a foodie and interested in cooking I bet you can cook better. 
Well the ambiance was decent the decoration is meaningful and the service was okay.. They could be a bit more professional though as they have big competition in the nearby area. 
To sum up its not really up to the mark and it's overpriced if the quality is considered.. If I want to eat buffet next time I would definitely go to someplace else...

It's bad. Simply bad. Since we keep going to different places almost every weekend and we had missed out this one, we decided to try this. The decor is below average. The menu looked fabulous. In fact it serves continental, oriental and Indian put together, something like one step up at Park st. Unfortunately none of the dishes was upto the mark. They are tasteless. We had tried the continental and oriental menu. The lobster was horrible so was the pad Thai noodle. Most importantly when I paid around 5500 for four of us for such low quality food I repented my decision of choosing this one.

The food quality is not so good,  i like the ambience when i enter the restro the host is really good to me but talking about the food  is not worth  it to pay money in such a type of restaurant , i had a buffet which does not consist of seafood items rather it more of chicken and indian items . And i dont like they take away  the griller before my meal was not even completed.music is good....jelly fish light is not good...it should b white in colour.... Servers are really in hurry to clear the table... This is really not a way to serve.. And i had the profiteroles  and found some seed inside and thats really depress me. I  hope next time it will be better to go somewhere eles.. And server should.not talk so much  in front of the guest....  Bye

Ever since I landed in¬† Saltlake this place was in my list. Personally I being fond of sea food this place was must go. The ambience and decor ( ocean themed) is pretty average. There is an attached bar which can be an add on if you want to host party.There are 2 food options. ala carte and buffet (more preffered). honestly speaking I am dissapointed with the variation of sea food in the buffet menu. I mean just normal fish, prawn, crabs (normal restrus even cater to it) for some one specialising in sea food. On a positive note the prawns are pretty juicy and overall quality of food is good. Please introduce more of sea food (if not already) like oysters, octopus , squids amonst others. Overall Food is decent but sea food spread is not satisfactory.

The lunch buffet is awesome, with the variety of items served. Decor is lovely, with comfortable seating arrangement. Starters include items of fish, chicken and prawn on the non-veg section and corn, paneer and vegetables in the veg-section. I just LOVED the prawn cocktail served in starters.¬†
Much to my surprise, along with fish, chicken, mutton and prawn, the main course spread also had one crab-meat dish. The biriyani in main course was a bit different from usual, though I couldn't eat much of it as I already had more than enough starters and had to save some space for desserts. But one thing I would like to mention here is that they put equal effort in their main course offerings, not just the starters and desserts.
I liked their effort of including cheesecake in buffet spread, but being a passionate cheesecake lover, I didn't like the texture of it. Maybe that's because they're making it in bulk to keep pace, but cheesecakes need delicate love :( Well the brownies were a bit dry to my liking too. Other items were good, there were 7/8 in total.¬†

Special mention goes to service- prompt and helpful.¬†
Will definitely go back.

Had a wonderful buffet lunch here on Sunday. 700 plus taxes for non veg buffet was worth every penny.  
I counted about 8 starter items including 4 non veg starters. TASTE and freshness was awesome. 
Main course had one soup, with plain and herb rice, curry preparations of fish and chicken, delicious mutton biryani, lachchedar parathas and raita. Veg buffet had few other items which I dint scroll through. 
Desert section had 6 items which were all good more or less. Mostly made specially on Valentine‚Äôs Day Eve. 
Ice cream was absent which was the only turn off. 
Decent staff, helpful and smiling always.

We were at Ocean Grill for lunch after being turned away from Barbecue Nation. A Sunday afternoon, the latter reported a 3 hour waiting period :) Having nil expectations from Ocean Grill helped as I came away pleasantly surprised.¬†

I had the veg buffet and counted about 8 starters. Variety and taste wise, pretty good. A punchy fresh lime soda helped make it a good first round. Main course was quite limited with a couple of subzis, the stock but soulless pasta and Chinese. Nothing noteworthy here. Desserts worked better. Fruits, heart shaped souffles (Valentine's Day strikes), gulab jamun and an excellent jam cookie. Curiously, icecream was missing in action. The others had only good things to say about the non veg starters.¬†

A word about the lady who was manning the floor. She was efficient and polite, ensuring there was always enough food. The veg buffet is priced at 500+taxes and the non veg buffet at 700+taxes. It will be hard pressed to become the top choice but would do well to secure the second spot in corporate Sector 5. I was fairly impressed as it cannot be easy running a buffet business opposite the big daddy!

We have been here yesterday for dinner with 30 odd members of family and friends. We have booked the lounge section which they have separated from the main dining area by using collapsible glass partition. This 28 seater lounge was ideal for our get together. Ambience is good and you can also request for additional decor for around rs1200 including fancy lights.  Well, the FOOD... been here before and hence, it has been easy to decide this as the best option for the do even though we have considered other popular hotels and restaurants in salt lake and new town locality after analyzing many factors including food quality. I would certainly like to mention the following without which this review would be incomplete:
1. Variety of items
2. A shift from the common menu (like the ones of tangry kebab and oriental crispies) which is the norm for most of the restaurants. Few items like the crsipy baby corn and paneer tikka are from the common bunch though :)
3. Meat pie, chicken wings and prawn cocktails are highlights of the non veg starters while the paneer tikka was best among the veg starters.
4. Inclusion of chicken, fish (the obvious duo) along with crabs, prawns and mutton and nevertheless pork vindaloo makes the menu a complete one. 3 cheers on the menu planning(well..sorry veg lovers, my taste buds are not strong enough to offer a note on the veg fair)
5. Excellent customer orientation of all the staff including the management (arranging special service for the elderly in the group shows their dedication to customer orientation. (Just one request to the management...adding some disable friendly services like a wheel chair availability will be a
 great plus)
5. Overall a good package with logical pricing, good quality and variety of food paired with friendly service
6. Will strongly recommend for small gatherings and occasional dine out for the ones who wants to go little out of the chicken tikka way and still does not want to sail unknown waters.

Sizes of the crabs served was not very impressive...lack of parking space or valet is one discomfort factor for guests even though paid parking is available outside which demands some efforts to find an empty space.

Couple of friends also initiated orders for their upcoming events :)

I visited this place for the first time on 17th January, 2016. I wasn't so keen on trying this place, as I have heard just above average things about this place. The joint is located bang opposite to BBQ Nation at Sec V, salt lake. The place is well decorated and exudes a marine vibe. At entry there are some innovative pressure plates, which are fun to stand on and those plates reminded me of Rorschach Test. The services are OK..not excellent, because I didn't appreciate manager's repeated reminder of restaurant's break time. The foods are good.. But the fish items need special mention. They are yummy and very different in taste than anything I have eaten before. The buffet didn't constitute any ocean food but there are ample number of items. Food items other than fish items are average in taste. The desserts are okayish as well.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Ample number of items in buffet.
3. Ambiance
4. Fish items are yummy.
5. Main course items are better than many other buffets.

Cons:
1. Service is okayish at best.
2. Price is in higher side.

This is an above average restaurant which should take a cue from the service standard of its across road neighbour.

Today visited this place for the buffet lunch.. but i am disappointed with this restaurant for many reasons..
1. First of all with the name OCEAN there is nothing can represent it with its name except some medium size aquarium. So. there is nothing in their ambiance. After entering there its looking like a medium standard..
2. Second thing, the services of its staff are so bad..i think they need proper training for this type of job..
3. The standard of their food or the quality of the food is so bad.. they have to check their menu or the qualities of their food..
4. The last thing is the PRICE factor.. Today they charged me 836 per head..Its looking like expensive with this type of service or food..Some other buffet places charging less than it and serving a better quality of food and services..

Sorry, i am disappointed and it will be the last time.. Thank you..

Visited for dinner in December. Nice overall experience. The cocktails are nice. Amongst the food - Thai fish cake and the Goan fish curry, lemon-grass chilly chicken w jasmine rice were standouts. Desserts were yummy too. Devil's crab was different from elsewhere but good. The portions could have been a little more generous. But the buffet spread clearly wore a tired look. Seemed they were cooked for lunch.

Oceans Grill as the name suggests ought to be the paradise of sea food lovers' but was disappointed upon seeing the interiors which has nothing to do with the oceanic offering sparring an aquarium. We opted for buffet and was quite impressed with the spread on offer. Now comes the main draw...the food. The starters start with a well prepared prawn cocktail followed by american corn, crispy baby corn, morola fry followed by kebabs. Pretty good as far as tastes are concerned. The main course comprised of salads, soup, breads, laccha paratha, mutton biriyani, mutton, chicken,creamy mustard fish,pork bhindaloo and crab. Fish was not good in taste and most of the items tasted bland. The dessert platter comprised of mango tart, custard, kiwi cake,profit roll, gulabjamun, fresh fruits and ice cream (vanilla) only. Overall review:Disappointed.

I've been to this place a couple of times and had a nasty experience years back, but I believe that the management has changed and the new team is now doing a fabulous job. This place is a non veg food lovers paradise. In the a la carte. One must not miss the herb crushed baramundi and the harissa grilled chicken. The buffet too was lovely. I simply loved the non veg starters and the mains. Especially the chili chicken on buffet was stunning. As was the crab. The fish in mustard sauce tasted yummy too. The vegetarian friends seemed slightly disappointed but non vegetarian people on the table seemed satiated. Coming back again for a group meet soon.

I was kind of apprehensive about visiting basically a non-veg specialty place and having a veg meal. Its sort of a mental block thing for me. I know a lot of people would not agree with this but hey that's just how I think. Since it was our monthly foodie meet I decided to give it a go. We had a special buffet available for us and in the veg section we got to try out the following things: Paneer Tikka
, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, American Corn, Veg Pizza, Jacket Potatoes, Chilli Paneer, Pasta
, Baked Veg, Dal, Steam Rice, Paneer, Veg Hakka Noodles, Cantonese mix Veg, Gulab jamun
, Blueberry Cream Cake, Profiterole and Fruit Truffle.

Overall the only thing that I really like was the dal and the chilly paneer. The rest of the food was not to my taste as it was quite bland and had no taste to it. And by that I dont mean that it lacked chilly. There are other spices out there. The noodles were not good and gave of a faint taste and smell of oil. The crispy chilly babycorn was decent. In the desserts the only thing I liked were the Profiterole. The blueberry cream cake was very weird as it was just flavored cream shaped out like a cake. 

To be fair the non vegetarians enjoyed a lot of the items served to them. But it was a major disappointment for the vegetarian crowd.

We went for our anniversary dinner on a week night. The place can be easily located. It is on the first floor of a well known building and though not extremely spacious, the decor makes up for it. It is unique and fabulous. We chose to have the buffet. The starters were served on the table. I was expecting a grill and kebab platter but was pleasantly surprised to find that the starters have been well planned and an effort has been made to keep them different from the usual fare. There were chicken and fish kebabs served on the grill but besides that prawn cocktail, meat pie, crispy baby corn and fish anchovy were also provided. The quality was above average and quantity was more than adequate. In fact I found the taste of the prawn cocktail better than the one served at Mocambo. The main course had ample choices in both the vegetarian and non vegetarian sections. Fish, chicken, crab, pork items were supplemented by a mutton biryani among the non vegetarian fare. The schwezuan crab, fish in mustard sauce and the pork vindaloo were my personal favourites. The teri teri chicken reminded me of an old favourite which my grand father used to bring from the now closed Sky Room restaurant on way back from court. There were 8/9 items in the dessert section and the caramel custard and the profiteroles were outstanding. We could not have enough of them. What I particularly loved was the tea served at the end which completed the lovely dinner. Also must mention the wide variety of cocktails and mocktails available here. A place to go back to...

Visited ocean grill recently which is a completely different place now with new management , decor and menu and yes, change is for good !!

The new version has a decent decor. The menu has been revamped and is much more exhaustive now. The staff service however needs improvement. The chef was very cordial and warm. I tried the buffet that had a huge spread at pretty reasonable pricing. But somewhere I was not totally satisfied.

Coming to food, starters were average but tandoori aloo on the live grill was superb. Paneer tikka seemed under marinated to me. Chef obliged me to a portion of butter tossed broccoli and asparagus that was lovely. Main course was decent with some exceptional dishes like black dal, Thai green curry. Desserts were disappointing though.

In my opinion spread was huge but their best dishes were not in it. Also many of the preparations seemed lacking the flair. Overall I would prefer this place for ala carte and stick to continental cuisine.

Ocean grill was on my wishlist since ages. I finally managed to try it out when it was selected as the venue for our food group's latest meet up.We were offered a set meal involving a huge variety of items at a very very reasonable price.

The ambiance and decor of this place is really nice and classy.The boat on one side,the wall decorations and the octopus and other sea creature shaped over hanging lights contributed wonderfully in recreating a sort of oceanic theme the name of the place ought to have had. I was particularly fascinated by the floor mats in the entrance.

Coming to the food, we started of with the chicken tikka kebab and the prawn cocktail. The chicken tikka was one of the standout dishes of the day.It was wonderfully tender and succulent and tasty with a perfect blend of the right spices. The prawn cocktail was neatly ¬†done up with a generous proportion of prawns. I would have preferred it to have been served somewhat chilled. ¬†The meat pie was average. I somehow did not enjoy the sauce. The grilled chicken wings were decent. The hariyali fish tikka was again nice and tender. The paneer tikka was fresh subtle and tasty. The American corn was another dish that caught my fancy. The fried corns tossed with onions and spices tasted lovely and went perfectly with my drinks. I also tasted one of their specials in the herb crusted barramundy which was lovely both in terms of taste and texture.

The main course buffet was as diverse as the starters. The overall quality of the main course though nothing out of this world was better than what we tend to get at most buffets. The prawn thai green curry was pretty decent and flavourful. The Goan spiced crab was okayish. The crabs were fresh but the gravy lacked punch in terms of taste. I enjoyed the fish in creamy mustard sauce. I felt it had a good balance of flavors. The chicken peri peri was again very well done with nice and succulent pieces of chicken. Rather surprisingly the chicken dishes here impressed me,although I would have preferred to have been served up more impressive and unique seafood delicacies. This would perhaps have been one of the drawbacks of the buffet spread.

Among the desserts,we had the caramel custard,gulab jamun,fruit truffle,mousse and the profiterole most of which were nice., The mousse and the profiterole i especially liked.

Overall I enjoyed the meal and our outing at Ocean's grill. The buffet here with its wide diversity and rather moderate pricing is surely one of the more attractive buffet options in the city.

Three of us went to Ocean Grill this October and had, Chicken A La Kiev(s)- crumbed chicken breast stuffed with garlic and herb butter, served with mash potato and sauteed greens. And Seafood Platter(s)- lobster, prawns, squid, mussels, sea bass, clams and crab, with herb rice and garlic bread. Delicious food, and the quantity was more than enough. What I loved the most, was the light pleasant taste of squid, served with a dipping sauce. Really yummy stuff! The chicken was fantastic, and itself was a big hit. The soft beverages were also good. Nothing to complain about, though missed the octopus in our platter(s). The food, ambience, music, it was wonderful there.

We recently organized a team lunch from our office in Oceans Grill Sec-v on a Wednesday afternoon. We were a group of 9 people, who had great expectations on the food and service of this place. I had dined at least 2-3 times earlier and those experiences were quite good. But this time, I was very disappointed to see that both the quality and variety of food has degraded. Also, the service was too slow for our liking. There were not enough variety on the starters they served, which were part of the buffet. Also, the quality of the starters were not up to the mark. Even I thought some of the starters were made from not-so-fresh meat and fish.¬†

Few observations:
- Duck was undercooked. It was difficult to tear.
- Crab preparation was good, but the size of the crabs were so small, that you don't get enough reward after you spend so much energy breaking the shell
- Fish crispy fry - I think the fish was not so fresh
- No kabab preparation on mutton or prawns

The cost of the buffet is a whopping 1000+ (including taxes). But the no. of items and their quality were really not up to the mark, when you consider the high price. Lastly, when I tried to pay using Amex card they demanded additional 2% surcharge, though "American Express cards welcome" were written on the file in which they brought the bill.¬†

Overall I am extremely disappointed with the way it has degraded within a short time. I believe there are better options in sector V in lesser price.

Located in the prime location of sector 5 salt lake..it is easy to locate..we went there on weekdays so there was no rush..the staff welcomed us with smile on there face..they were very helpful through out the service..now coming to the food..we had indian..the kebabs were really good..the tandoori  roti and mutton roganjosh deserve a special mention..we also had brownie with ice for dessert..the brownie could be better from my point of view..it was more like a cake for me..other than that no complaints about the food..the price is a lil bit high but looking at its location and food i dont think it is a big issue..overall experience great..4/5 is my verdict.

I visited this restaurant a few months back during my calcutta visit. Heard a lot about their Buffet. But visited the restaurant with an  ensemble of friends who were oddly divided in buffet and a-la-carte and finally we went for a-la carte. 

Their variety is quite widespread and the ambiance is quite good. I didn't like the service much though. It was quite slow and the servers were much not aware about their own menu. So be ready that you won't get any details if you ask questions about any item in the menu. 

I ordered a few starters which were all good. I loved the golden fried prawns. But the prawns can be a little bigger. As calcutta being so close to the source of jumbo prawns and tiger prawns. I liked the batter fried fish and the lamb roast. 

Ordered Nasi Goreng for main course. I was not much impressed with that. Liked the dessert though. Ordered a tiramisu for Desert. I would like to come back here once to try out the seafood platter which definitely looked promising.

Went for the lunch buffet a couple of weeks back. I had heard average reviewsabout the place but had also learnt that the food has improved greatly due to a management and chef change. The buffet obviously focused more on seafood. In the starters, the mustard prawn and the grilled fish is worth the mention. The babycorn and chicken are also served in the starters. They also had a crab cake, but it was not good at all. The main course had a mix cuisine of chicken biryani, palao and pasta with devil prawns, crab, bhetki, a cheesy baked veg dish, dal makhani and some more dishes. The desserts had a variety of cheesecakes, pastry,  custard and tarts. The buffet was good but not great. It has the potential to be a great buffet with the type and variety of dishes on offer but the preparation of the grills n seafood main dishes need to be improved on greatly

The place is good. The food is good. But unfortunately the day I had visited it was a bit of a letdown. I enjoyed the Khaosuey and the Pad Thai. The starters were average .....

On my second visit to the place last evening all and any complaints I had with the place vanished. I had been there with my fiance and a friend and we were in a bit of a hurry because we had a movie to catch.

We had ordered Chicken Peri Peri, Chicken A la Kiev and The Squid Sea food platter and we were immensely happy with the quality of service. The service was prompt, the place was well decorated and the food was delicious.

Especially the grilled squid with lemon garlic sauce and herb rice with sauteed veggies. I can easily say that I am yet to try better squid. Loved the experience . Looking forward to my next visit.

What a disaster! Pathetic staff, worst service. You get 1% worth you pay for. Stale starters, unwillingness to serve or repeat. Agonizing delays in service. Then comes main course, which is a bigger disaster. Tasteless stale food. The happy ending deserts wouldn't leave you happy at all, basically standard low cost stuff being served, with no desert spoons obviously. The bill won't be provided, they are issuing hand written bills to evade taxes, but charge you full tax. Biggest mistake to try this place!

The ambience is great. They play good music. We went for a veg meal. Half of the dishes weren't available. The service was a bit slow. This might be my reason to give a low score. For starters we tried makai malai seekh kebab and crispy chilli babycorn. Both the dishes were very well prepared. Cocktails were decent. But nothing was available in chinese and continental veg dishes. Just a tip, Confirm everything before ordering, so that you don't spoil your dining mood.

Good place for a buffet! We had their Puja Special buffet which was more expensive than the regular one, but had more choices. It included North Indian, Bengali and Continental cuisines. Apart from starters, main courses and desserts, they also had a Phuchka counter! Wish they had included octopus and squid dishes too, considering it's mainly a seafood place, and the pocket pinch was around 950 per person (with taxes.)

I am very much satisfied with the buffet dinner at Ocean Grill which I visited with my family recently. Great starters ( prawn items are fantastic ) , many varieties in the main course with their finger licking taste will certainly enhance the appetite of the food lovers. Dessert section is fine but the lacking of ice cream makes the course incomplete. The staff members are very attentive and well behaved. They even took care of my little child. I am very much impressed with the whole situation hence Ocean Grill rightly deserves a very strong recommendation from my end.

We went for veg buffet lunch there. The starters were many and most of the items were quite good. They served the starters.¬†Then comes main course. The veg and non veg salads were kept side by side and I accidentally picked up a non-veg one. Non veg salads are not very common and a clear distinction would be better. The main course food were not at all eatable. The items were just average.¬†

Now comes dessert. They were very good both in texture and taste. They have experimented with desserts and served few uncommon and good items for the same.¬†
The ambience is good. Cleanliness is also good. Overall a good place to visit.

Went here for my birthday, late at night with a few friends and cousins, well the ambiance is really good, the dim lit place gives in a good feeling, but the food is not that enticing compared to the cost associated to it. The alcohol is decently priced, we ordered a couple of towers. The service is decent and the waiters are friendly,

Go for the ambiance and the alcohol, not really for the food.

Not the very best. Advertisd for sea foods but first 4 items we tried to order were either unavailable or told to be delayed. As it's located in the heart of IT sector, most people visiting there are during office lunc break so faster service is expected. Obviously they serve buffet and items from that menu are served faster but again it was over priced against the food taste. Ambience is good and staff behavior is courteous.

Tried out their well known and much talked about lunch buffet. I gotta say this place has some fine seafood options though their a la cart√© menu could seem a little overpriced. The buffet kickstarted with a prawn cocktail, which was totally a I-could-do-with-some-more dish! The hariyali fish tikka and chicken wings are worth a mention too. However, the crab meat was a huge disappointment. Vegetarian options for starters were mainstream like baby corn and paneer. Main course was great too, but the dishes that stole the show were Thai prawn curry and chilli garlic crab. Fish in mustard sauce and some of the pasta options like baked penne and augratin with roasted tomato were great too. Dessert counter can definitely be improved, however, their gulab jamun and caramel custard would be any sweet-lover's paradise! The place does have  slow service but the decor's totally pretty and cosy!

I went there for dinner with my office colleagues and we opted for a-la-carte menu instead of buffet. Following is the list we ordered.

Romani Mahi Tikka - Average
Golden Fried Prawn - Very small sized prawns. Not recommended
Lamb Steak - It was ok. Though I personally do not like the taste of Lamb
Mongolian Chilli Fish - Average
Chicken In Sauce - Did not like it
Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice) - Did not like it at all. They should serve more rice varieties, possibly more of Chinese delicacies.
Chicken Hakka Noodles - Average
Green Chilli Chicken - Average
Chicken Irani Kabab - Poor. Kababs were topped with egg white froth. It was awful in taste.
Chocolate Mousse - Good
Caramel Custard - Poor. Never try this one
Tiramisu - Excellent

Ambiance - 4.5
Service - 4.5
Food Taste/Quality - 2.5

P.S. - Pics posted here are not clear due to camera malfunction, flash not working.

Went there for the first time last night. It was highly recommended the zomato reviews were rave, but personally we were highly dissapointed. We opted for the Pujo special dinner buffet and ordered devilled crab from the ala carte menu. The devilled crab was such a let down, the meat was brittle and dry and did not smell fresh at all, we infact did not end up eating more than two of the five crabs. The best part of the buffet was the diy chaat, the starters were ok. The prawns and bbq chicken wings were nice but all the tandoori items being fish and chicken were so dry and tasted stale that we did not even touch them. The meat pie was ok. The menu was a queer mix. Not enough of any cuisine. Two chinese, three conti and then some dal, bhaat phulkopir torkari... it wasnt a satisfactory meal at all. Desert was also soso. Overall not the best experience and not vfm at all! Sorry but my first and last visit. Oh. Ps. The salads tasted stale too...why?

To be honest, this place has impressive seafood. And i would've given it a 4.5 if there wasn't such a commotion with my Lobster .But to be fair, it was during the pujo rush. The ambience is great. They have a smoking room attached to their lounge (yay!). But they played bad Bangla movie songs all through. 
  The seafood bisque they serve is heavenly, with a light refreshing taste and a flavourful aroma. The shredded seafood in the bisque was cooked perfectly so the squid and octopus bits weren't chewy or rubber like. The devil crabs they serve was  beautifully seasoned, balancing the taste of the crab itself with cheese and cream. I think the crab shells that were used for serving smelled fishy, but then hey, it's seafood. 
My father had sweet corn soup, which was standard, and BBQ chicken wings, which were big and juicy, with one of the best barbecue sauces I have ever had in kolkata.
 However, the epic fail was the Lobster Thermidor, mainly because they served me lobster in a cream and garlic sauce. When I asked them to change it, since it was of course their mistake, they took it back happily, but brought the same damn plate back after half an hour with some grated cheese on the lobster. Then they began to explain to me how the first time it was lemon butter sauce sauce and how the grated cheese on top made it a Thermidor. This made no sense to me. The waiter's name was Sudip Maity and I believe him to be a completely unhelpful, uncourteous, stubborn little prick.
However I was stuck with a plate of twice microwaved yet cold lobster that was rubbery, and had clumpy white sauce and garlic on it. Although the manager apologised much later, I had to eat a 800 bucks plate of lobster on which the best thing was the sliced mushroom that came with the grilled vegetable on the side.

Finally,their profiteroles were a little soggy because the cream filling inside was runny,  but I still think it was  quite okay due to the fluffy outer pastry.

My wife and I went there for dinner 2 days back (21st October). It was a bit late, around midnight and they were featuring a Durga Puja Special buffet dinner. There were 2 veg and 2 non-veg starters. The veg starters (Makai Malai Kabab and Paneer kabab) were a big let down. Both of them were cold and tasted very bland. Among the non-veg starters, the fish was very good, but the chicken was quite ordinary. The service was very slow and reluctant.

For the main course, some of the basic amenities, like plates, were not there and we had to go and tell the waiters to bring us some plates. Some of the food trays were also empty and not refilled. For example, there was a luchi tray which was empty and we're told that they're out of that. The mutton biriyani didn't have any mutton pieces, and we had to go tell the waiters to bring us some mutton pieces. All of the dishes were cold and presented in a sloppy manner. Same was the condition of the dessert counter.

So, summing up,

Pros: Some of the food items, fish starters, biriyani, chicken chap were good to taste.

Cons: Service was terrible. The food was cold and presented in a sloppy manner.

Alright, you really need to decide whether you are going for buffet or a-la-carte. Remember, what you get in one will not be available in another.. 
Really almost decade later, tasted a really different kind of soup, unlike those corn soup. So, if you really wanna, try this seafood mistique. Also the fish bucket was amazing. You might wanna set aside chicken for that...

A late dining at ocean grill was quite pleasant I would say. Enough with buffets and same old kabbabs. It was time to try out exquisite sea food. And it turned out to be fantastic. The grilled prawns and spicy crab are worth going for. Even the lamb steak I ordered turned out to be a mouth watering dish. Ambiance lets them down, and the prices too are way on the higher side considering the service they provide. Staff behavior is excellent. Seafood lovers one time visit is a must.

Was toggling between 4 and 3.5 and then the expectations were set so high that 3.5 prevailed as such were not met to be true. Place was good, no doubt about that. Though except interiors, nothing special about continental, and especially after opting for the buffet, I was completely sure. 
There were 6 starters, same as everone else's, only the meat pie was unique, nothing else was. Taste was ok. Main course was also same. Biriyani and chicken was good, not continental though :p though the fish was little smelly, lamb was not good at all. Deserts had many options, but mostly strawberry flavoured, which incidentally I don't like. 

Overall, food was good, but nothing "continental" about it. Probably should have tried ala carte. Decent experience I would say.

This is my first rating in this category and this restaurant has sucessfully managed to secure this mark .

Apart from good waiters ,this place has nothing to offer .now lets move on to the review

Generally when you have over the top grill and skewers ..you should provide skimmers too in order to skimm out the bbq ..but this restaurant doesnt provide you such an amenity but the staff pull them out for you using a fork ! Highly unprofessional ! .... The food was medicore and if you compare the food with bbq nation ! Well just done compare...it will leave you guessing ....

The buffet option were poor. ..the prawn curry didnt have prawn .....it takes them forever to get them .....chicken and mutton recipes are okay! Dessert saves tha day for them 

But the food quality overall is not priceworthy ! 

Go here only if bbq nation is full and you are very hungry and dont wanna wait !

We've just had a solo visit here and left with the idea of not visiting this place again. But now I think reading the latest reviews we may change our mind to give this place a try one more time.
As soon as you enter, you would find jelly like tiles, jelly fish like lights and a shark on the wall with blue lighting, giving it an ocean like feeling. The buffet is served on a boat and all this enhances your dining experiences. Overall, we were very impressed with the ambiance and the well spaced out seating arrangement in the crowded restaurant.
We opted for their buffet and got utterly disappointed. Everything had an over dose of cheese in it making everything taste similar be it prawn, crabs or fishes. For some reason the sea food didn't taste good at all, and mind it, we are sea food lovers. The only item I ended up liking is their crispy fried baby corns!
With such a disappointment we had dessert just for the sake of filing our stomach for the night and don't remember much about it.
Not sure if we can recommend anyone without giving this place another chance

The name says it all. A restaurant that gives you feeling of being on board. Blue walls decorated with colourful fishes and buffet items placed on the deck of an old ship. The tables are all blue and chairs are a combination of blue and white. It is mainly continental and with a good amount of varieties. They serve alcohol and mocktails and cocktails. So we had ordered "Orange Tulip", now don't expect that to be orange colour. Along with this "For Ever Green" and this time it was not green - evergreen, but orange, which tasted sweet and delicious. "Vietnamese Chicken and Noodle soup", a blend of noodles, coconut milk, vegetables and lemon leaves adding to the aroma to the taste.¬†

If you are a KFC lover, then try the "Fish Bucket", yummy! It is soft and tasty. Anyone who doesn't like fish would love it. Now coming to the main course - "Chicken Surf & Turf", don't think Surf Excel was added :P. It was a mixture of Chicken, Prawn, Octopus, Squid and Oyster. Tasted brilliant with the Garlic Bread. "Herb Crusted Oven Baked Bhetki", a big baked bhetki on your plate, don't wait and just dig in. Both of the main course were added with mushrooms and broccoli.¬†

The garnishing is very attractive and would increase your appetite.¬†

There were few of the items which we had ordered and we were told it was not available. Some of the staff members were not aware if the dish was white sauce or red sauce based, spicy or non-spicy. The staff should work on their knowledge of the items that are available.

To end with, it is a brilliant place, and must go for all. If you are not fish lover, there are other options like chicken and lamb. You can excuse the drink part. There is an option for Al a Carte and Buffet...choice is yours. Enjoy eating.

This markets itself mainly as a sea food restaurant and has quite a few delectable dishes. The Buffet however has a very Indian feel. Would have been a lot better if the Buffet was more of sea food. The a la carte is the one to go for if you plan to go here. Decor is nice too.

Ocean Grill, located at Sector V, Saltlake of Kolkata serves seafoods, particularly. It includes a bar too. So enjoy the seafoods with drinks. On my solo visit til date I opted a la carte instead of buffet. So can't compare them. However foods are really yummy. Cool ambience and helpful OG staffs are just cherry on the top.

Bang opposite to Barbeque Nation, on the RDB Boulevard, this restaurant may not be as well equipped as Barbeque Nation but it makes up for the drawback with warmth and ambience.

From the moment we entered, we were made to feel comfortable and were personally attended to by Mr. Sudip who was very helpful and went the extra mile by providing complimentary ice cream as dessert for my 2 kids (it was not a part of their buffet). 

Food was awesome ... the starters included prawn, chicken, mutton sheekh kabab & fish in non-veg and corn & paneer in veg(these were what we tried).

In main course, Biryani was good with quite big pieces of mutton; crab and prawn tasted nice and so did the railway murton curry. But special mention needs to be made of the Dal Makhani - arguably among the best we've had in Kolkata.

Verdict: must try.

So tired of the South and Park Street wanted to explore more of Salt Lake. I've been to bbq nation several times but my first venture here. Located inside a mall bang opposite to RDB boulevard. Looks soothing dressed in white and blue. The lounge is blue lit ambience is panoramic. Now the main thing food...we went for buffet. A warm welcome from the steward Sudip asked our preference and started serving with crispy chilli babycorn, mutton pie, prawn salt n pepper, chicken wings, chicken tikka kebab, fish hariyali kebab and paneer malai tikka kebab on the grill. Aerated beverage or fresh lime soda is complimentary with the buffet. A special mention of the prawn salt n pepper. ..I've never had such big sized tiger prawns in the city's most expensive Chinese buffets. Excellent. Buffet started with hot n sour chicken soup, chicken salad, fish salad, garlic prawn, fish in cream n mustard sauce, crab xacuti, peri-peri chicken, railway mutton curry, mutton Biriyani. PHEW!! That's the non-veg array. The Crabs were huge sized in a spicy sauce which was appealing. The mutton pieces were tender and the Biriyani had huge pieces of tender meat. Vegetarians have a lot too on their plate. Dal Makhani (Super Good), dhokar dalna, aloo mutter, paneer something, exotic veggies in Chinese style , veg hakka noodles. Whatever I tasted was very flavourful. Desserts had another array of items like gulab jamun, creme caramel, Monte Carlo a frozen dessert, strawberry pastry, one more nutty roll look alike. I did not expect such a feast. We've bypassed this place so many times and waited in front of bbq nation for hours. Staff was very courteous. Sudip was so guest friendly, he was personally taking charge of our table. A special .5 marks for him. Management please felicitate him on my behalf. He got ice creams to the table for my kids. Will visit again for sure. Recommend foodies with a seafood palate especially to definitely visit. Buffet is budget friendly too the royal feast costs 650 for an adult pax. Enjoyable.

We have been to this place last weekend only for a buffet dinner and it was completely a worst experience. The taste and appearance of food needs a lot of improvement. Tasteless food with a bad ambience and service. In short, it was a wastage of time and money.

DO NOT EVEN THINK OF TRYING THE BUFFET HERE. The a la carte might be fine, but what they served in the buffet was way below expectations. Though there were quite many special items like duck, Turkey, crab etc. the taste didn't click. The food, served both on the table and in the counter was cold and not replenished properly. Had to wait for so long for the mutton. Even the starters served on the table weren't that tasty. To top it all, the charges which they take is 50% more than the charges they claim. You ultimately have to pay rs.900 for a rs.600 buffet, due to the various taxes and charges, even though they claim rs.600 inclusive of all charges.

I have been to this place twice and what attracted me the most regarding this place is the ambience. This is a perfect place for any seafood lover or any underwater lover to visit. As soon as you enter, you would find those jelly tiles and I turned a bit childish while seeing that. And then you enter, you can see the jelly fish like lights and a shark at the wall.. The buffet is served on a boat and all that enhances your dining experiences. Talking about food, I loved it a lot. Being a hardcore non vegetarian, I generally skip the veg dishes. But the jacket potatoes and the Thai curry were amazing when it's about vegetarian dishes. And talking about non veg, I loved each and everything. The salad, the Thai curry and all the other dishes. But the best part is not here yet. I was highly impressed by the desserts served there. Profiteroles stole my heart away and I could have numerous of them at a go. I also liked the caramel custard and the gulab jamuns.. On the whole, I had a really good experience and would love to visit there again and again..

We went to Ocean Grill today to celebrate my birthday with family and we were overwhelmed by everything.

Starting with food quality, it was fabulous. They offered a sumptuous amount for buffet lunch. They went on serving piping hot & super delicious starters till we asked to stop. Special mention (for starters) goes to chilli prawns, soft crispy fish (KFC style crispy), lamb pie & chicken makhmali. Now in main course, one should definitely try out creamy mustard fish (Its the best), garlic prawns, Singaporean chilli crabs, peri peri chicken & mutton curry (the meat was so tender that it instantly melted in mouth)..!!

Now, lets come to the nature of staff which was so cordial that you have to visit this restaurant to experience it.

Moreover, they even presented me with a super delicious surprise birthday cake....!!

To sum it up, it was indeed an awesome experience for me as well as my family.

had a dinner there few days ago.¬†
chose it to taste sea food at its best.
service was real quick,staff were pretty cordial.
didn't have to stand in queue,though it was Saturday night,but it was lively ambiance.
went for a la carte.
coming to foods,soup simply tasted heaven and great in quantity also.
Seafood platter was an experience really , almost all sorts of seafood in one plate,loved it totally. Lamb steak kept the flow of delivering great taste. But,pasta was below average,didn't match up with other dishes. :(
All their dishes were loaded with lots of cheese so all tasted more or less,so a bit variation would be better. Maybe cheese was given so much to cover the seafood smell.
Fish in citrus was again superb,sauce given with was very tasty. :) 
Darsaan was ordered in dessert, and I don't like wonton ,so didn't like this one . but,ice cream was not given with Darsan,so had to call one,and remind them to give the ice cream with it. Not expected from them ! 
But staff was cordial and accepted their mistake. 
To finish, memorable dinner over there with my lovely dada and ma. 
I definitely recommend. :)

Chocolate Mousse at the end was a sweet tooth. Would like to visit again for trying other dishes. The layout was beautifully decorated..& Blue is my favorite colour anyways..a themed restaurant. But but service needs to be much more better! We had to wait a little long for the food to be served!

It was a good time spent with family in Ocean grill. They have A la carte and buffet as well. Price range, without a doubt, is on a higher side here. But I would say its worth it. When I wanted to order a platter one of the guy said its not available. Am sorry to say he was pretty arrogant and aggressive when I tried to make him understand the fact that when it's written in the menu it should have been there since it's not a roadside restro or dhaba. Anyhow thanks to the hostess (twinkle) who served us rest of the time with her polite behaviour and smart attitude unlike the other, turning it into a good experience.

I liked this place. The decor is ocean themed, very apt with the name. The food is also good. I had a look at the buffet spread, it looked good with varied choices. We ordered fisherman's basket as started, which was yummy. We went for the sea food platter which comes with or without lobster as per choice. It included a lot of things like octopus, squid, prawn, clams.......and comes with rice and bread, both. It is very filling even for 2 people. But the sauce with it is so buttery and lacks freshness. We had also tried fish with kemon butter sauce, which was spot on. The fish soft and melted in mouth. But the problem again was the sauce. Their service is nice with courteous waiters. Overall a good impression.

At the outset, I have to admit that the food here is fantastic, service average and interiors extremely tacky!

I went here with my parents on a Friday evening without prior reservation (bad idea)! My mum had read about this place in the Telegraph and was focused on wanting to have the Seafood platter which was exactly what the article had said it was - fresh, tasty and generous. We had also ordered Fish and Chips - again generous proportions and as flavorful fish and chips can be :), Beer and Bacardi Breezer.

OG is seemingly a popular hangout( and rightfully so) for young IT crowd from the neighborhood. By the time we got there( about 8:30 pm)-- the  happy raucous drunk crowd( all men) was starting to go out of control- talking and swearing in loud voices, using the Ladies' restroom with complete disregard (I have to say, though, that the signage on the restrooms - a male and female mermaid isn't helpful either - the only distinguishing feature of the male mermaid being his mustache -- HORROR) - drunks and bad signage are a terrible combination and result in very dirty bathrooms! Part of the experience - had to be written about!

A very young girl (on staff) was asked to walk the floor and tame the request for music which incrementally got louder ever 5 mins. She finally asked for forgiveness and asked that we understand that she too felt uncomfortable in the space with drunk men throwing drunk tantrums

The bar is separate from the family dining - which is fantastic - the family dining could have been larger. The wait was long and painful but once seated, everything was awesome!

Parking- valet available
Ambiance- 2.5/5-- very tacky and dark!
Service-3.5/5
Food quality and quantity- 4.5/5
Pricing- 4/5
Overall- 3/5

(I understand, though, that I was there, maybe, at the wrong place and the wrong time)

Had been to this place with a friend of mine for a casual dinnner.
Decor: excellent..goes well with the name.
Scores good on Seating arrangement and capacity.
Service was good.
We ordered for buffet: the starters were served on our table..the non veg starteres were really mouth watering. The kebabs were yum. They were not in a hurry to serve is the starters. Always asking us about the quality.
The main dishes were well spread with rice, chapatis, daal, veg items, prawns, crabs, chicken, fish etc..It was almost impossible for us to try out each and every dish. The dessert section to me was a let down though the items there were of good quality but i felt spread could have been better with items like muffins, pastries, tarts, different flavoured ice creams etc.
Over all a very good exp. and a special mention for the owner. He was personally there to take care of his guests.
Will have to try their ala carte.

On 14th February. 2017 went for the buffet dinner. Tried cocktail prawn-the newly introduced item in the starters. Trust me I'll have to revisit this restaurant for this. Out of the world where taste is concerned. By far the best prawn cocktail in Kolkata.

I was just spellbound when I entered the restaurant. So many times I went to Barbeque Nation just opposite to it and never cared to look back! It once we were bored of waiting outside the barbeque with my friends and decided to hit the place. First thing which attracted me is their polite welcome. They may have scarcity of staffs but they managed to satisfy customers with their limited manpower.
This is one of the few buffets in the city serving both prawn and crabs , both of giant size and good taste.the starters are served and the main course is a self service. The starters are in the better side of good.As for their main course they have a very rich option.But their desert collection is average.
I will visit the place again.

I was there for one of my colleagues birthday lunch, it was a nice experience, tasty food, nice service and good ambiance. But after that once again I had visit that place all alone and unexpectedly from front door I was like irritated with their gesture. Which made me uncomfortable to had my lunch.

Few places I had already observed this kind of gesture, for single person/customer some time service quality get degraded.

For food & ambiance I would love to give them 4.5 but, only because of service discrimination they deserve 2.

For a ship to survive the turbulence of the oceans and seas, all it needs is an experienced captain who's always on the toes and is capable of steering his ship to safety under all circumstances. Since years, a ship (restaurant) named Ocean Grill, has witnessed a steep dip in the popularity due to the display of sheer nonchalance of the then captains (management). In September 2014, after experiencing a nearly drowned situation, the ownership of the ship was passed on to the new captains, Mr. Shane & Mrs.

I've visited Ocean Grill several times earlier, tried there buffet mostly.. Good thing was earlier.. They had plenty of Non veg Starter n Jumbo Prawns( Golda) n Whole crab in there main course, Don't know how they used to manage.. n 5/6 varieties of desert.. Taste was perfect... Starter they use to serve directly from kitchen.. 

But this time after renovation of the Restaurant ,I went there with my Mom on 7th April 2015 mainly to have buffet. But I was dissapointed to see the menu, where there was Limited amount of Non Veg Starter Most of them was Indian, Even they have stopped serving Jumbo Prawns in there Buffet Menu.. So We decided to take ALA CARTE.. We ordered -

1. Ocean Grill Special Bisque [ 4 / 5 ] -¬† I have told them not to put Squid , Octopus in the¬† Soup instead they can put more prawn , crab n fish.. But they put some squid in it by mistake, that spoiled my mother's mood as she don't like it. . Crab meat was not there,when i asked about it they told that there is crab mince, they just blend it with the soup,u can feel the taste of it...
¬†As Soup was well made we didn't complain. they served garlic bread with it. 

2. Thai Fish Cake [ 3.5/5 ] -¬† 5pcs of Average size of Fish cake.. Tasted good but more of onion,ginger n garlic instead of fish.. As the portion of Minced Fish in that cake was lesser than that of other ingredients. Potion of Salad n a bit sweet peanut+coconut sauce served with it.. 

3. Chicken Surf n Turf [4/5 ] - 3 Medium slice of Chicken breast ,prawns n french fries tossed in pesto sauce.. Good in taste portion was huge for 2 person.. though in the menu card squid was not mentioned though I told them once again not to put squid n octopus..¬† A man came for 2nd serving suddenly noticed squid in it. n insisted n changed it.¬† We already had a good portion of that dish so we told them repeatedly that we don't want..We can manage the rest of it. But they didn't listen to us and bought a full plate of same dish ,served a bit and said we will pack the leftover for u..

4. Pinacolada [ 5/5 ] - Perfect

Staffs, n management are very nice n well behaved.. Ambiance is good as well..

Located just opposite of the RDB Cinema in Salt Lake, Sector ‚Äì V, this specious restaurant is a mast go-to if you want to try out different cuisines in one place. It is no doubt that it has become a popular place for corporate meetings and drawing the working crowd. They offers really affordable set buffet, consider this a good lunch option if you're in the area. The food here is authentic, generous, and generally remarkable.

This humble specious restaurant was acquired by Shane and Sumana in September‚Äô2014 from previous owner; they boast super flavorful dishes with the right amount of spice and tang, and big portions for extremely reasonable prices. Ocean Grill‚Äôs management believes that sharing makes a meal more enjoyable, and it's hard to disagree with that. An absolutely gorgeous place for weekend brunch, or dinner and drinks with your date, this is also a great spot for gatherings of any kind. It's fresh and plush ambience is perfect for a celebration, will put you at ease in its relaxed environment. Ocean Grill serves great food in a peaceful yet chic ambience.

After basic meet and greet we got seated and ‚ÄòFresh Lime Soda‚Äô were served, in the mean while I was slightly occupied with their buffet menu, tried little bit from nov veg section. Carb & prawn was remarkably tasty and played with my taste buds for a little. After coming back to the table I joined my friends to finalize today‚Äôs menu while sipping on chilled fresh lime soda and finally cherry picked a few from their vast menu.

Whoever said healthy food is tasteless is wrong! We started off our meal with their ‚ÄòChicken Caesar Salad‚Äô, sounds middling but quite tasty. Chicken Caesar Salad made with oven baked chicken, romaine, iceberg lettuce tossed in traditional Caesar dressing served with croutons, crostini & shaved parmesan that also drizzled with a delectable sauce on top. Ocean Grill's Chicken Caesar Salad really stands out with its spiced; oven baked boneless chicken pieces with a crisp caramelised crust, tossed in a flavour explosion of two kind of different savoured sauce. It‚Äôs actually jam-packed with flavour and healthy goodness in one plate.

I also tried ‚ÄòPanzanella Salad‚Äô from Rounak, its made with asparagus, broccoli, oven roasted pimentos, mushroom and cottage cheese tossed with assorted lettuce and pesto vinaigrette dressing served with croutons and crostini. If you'd like to go healthier, choose more greens! Even if you're not vegan, the salad here was worth a try.

Then unpredictably they serve their signature cocktails accompanied their mouth watering starters. In first round of cocktails they served us ‚ÄòHollywood Night‚Äô, ‚ÄòUltimate 77 Sunset‚Äô, ‚ÄòPlanters Punch‚Äô and ‚ÄòPink Lady‚Äô.

Hollywood night was made with Midori Melon Liqueur, Coconut Rum (Malibu), Pineapple Juice, Sprite and Maraschino Cherry. This classic hollywood night was one of the most delicious cocktails among the servings. It was also one of the simplest cocktails anyone could possibly make with pineapple juice and coconut rum, totally refreshing.

Planters punch made with white rum, dark rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and fresh lime was next, one sip and I was smiling, perfect. White Rum & Dark Rum made perfect balance without overpowering each other, but you will definitely feel the after kick.

Pink lady served with gin, grenadine & egg white. I don‚Äôt liked it very much, somehow missing the wow feeling.

Ultimate 77 sunset dealt the final blow, fusion of vodka, gin, spiced rum, triple sec, pineapple juice, grenadine, and Sprite. Ultimate 77 sunset was a typical summertime cocktail to beat the heat. Just imagine a cocktail in hand, washing down a table of different foods while enjoying the soft music in background.

My non-alcoholic friend Shahbaaz enjoyed, ‚ÄòKiwi Mojito‚Äô made with lemon wedges, mint leaves, demerara sugar, kiwi syrup & sprite and later on ‚ÄòItalian Smooch‚Äô prepared with sliced ginger, brown sugar, lemon juice & cola. I took a sip from both and they were too good.

Now let‚Äôs talk about their starters, first to arrive was Green Chilli Fish ‚Äì a fiery yet soft vetki preparation tossed with stair fried capsicum and onion cubes. You'll be in for a surprise because you'll never quite know what to expect. A truly tongue twisting dish, awesome for those who loves spicy food.

Following item was Malai Sheekh Kebab made with mixed of vegetables, sweet corn, herbs & cottage cheese on skewers brushed with warm chilli butter and cooked in a tandoor oven. Its delight for vegan again, it was soft & aromatic but I felt they were bit dry when I put them in my mouth.

American Corn Kernels failed to impress me, again felt it was little bit dried out though the spicy and crunchy batter invoked some interest in my mind.

Mushroom Malai Kebab was truly astounding, cheesy grilled mushrooms marinated with cream and spices, just melts in our mouth. Don't assume that these innocent looking healthy mushrooms were bland and boring; they won't fail to satisfy you.

Harrissa Grilled Chicken was another startling dish, made with soft boneless chicken pieces which were marinated in a fiery Moroccan spice paste. Harrissa Grilled Chicken was very well executed pieces of grilled chicken ‚Äì charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying sauce. They did a nice, smoky sear on the outside while leaving the centre soft, so that you get to enjoy the softness of the chicken.

Final starter of the day was Jacket Potato, it was well cooked, potato with skin had a fluffy interior and a crisp skin, served with fillings and condiments such as butter, cheese and mushrooms. The Jacket potatoes were excellent as well: cooked flawlessly and served with two kinds of sauces and special dip.

If you're just looking to grab a drink and small bites, choose from their wonderful selection of starters, and pick a nice cocktail from their Euro-centric cocktail list.

All these starters made me thirsty again and this time I went for Frozen Green Apple Margarita. The Green Apple Margarita was an all time popular frozen cocktail, that features tequila mixed with green apple syrup, lime juice and cointreau, maintain flavour balance while keeping some of that Pucker punch and faint green colour. Just one sip and you will definitely fall in love with its mind blowing taste & flavour.

Now it‚Äôs time for main course, their signature dish Chicken Surf & Turf appeared on our table, flavour was attractive and garnishing was eye pleasing. This dish was made with sliced grilled chicken breast topped with prawns and creamy sauce served with clams and grilled vegetables. The well-executed fusion of flavours leads to unexpected and often delectable results. Combination of grilled chicken with soft prawns, well cooked clams & grilled vegetables was a unique find and is definitely worth a try.

Next to try was Thai Mixed Seafood with steamed rice. Do not miss their Thai Mixed Seafood, a dish of fork-tender prawn pieces doused in red curry sauce, was one of their unique dishes, too good to resists. The Thai mixed seafood was aromatic and pleasantly lighter, so you can easily pair it with steamed without disturbing the steadiness of flavour. Your meal will not be complete without their Mixed Seafood in Thai red curry.

The hot favourite in vegetarians was the Thai Veg. Green Curry, perfectly blended herbs and veggies inside a warm flavourful curry, delicious and healthy for the health conscious working crowd.

Again I need a drink after this heavy meal and opted Martini Sweet Vermouth, it was very similar to a Classic Gin Martini. It‚Äôs a wonderful classic cocktail made with vodka, dry vermouth, bitters and green olive, nice way to end your meal.

A must-try dessert was their Profiteroles, a truly innovative dessert of filled French choux pastry ball with a typically sweet filling of whipped cream, pastry cream, custard, or ice cream. Just about nowhere in Kolkata does Profiteroles better than this institution, with every meal here promising consistently high standards.

If you want something not so sweet-ish, go for their Caramel custard. And if you want something more, try their Two in one mousses which were light yet very flavourful. End off your meal with their vegan dessert, dry but heavenly Banana cake served with whipped cream that was heavy on the lips but not on your hips!

Bring your family or a group of hungry friends, and share these awesome-sized portions. Don't forget the Jacket Potatoes and Harrissa Grilled Chicken! Don't miss their desserts either; the Profiteroles are to die for. You'll be so satisfied eating at Ocean Grill‚Äôs; you'll be scheduling your next visit even before you leave! Make reservations if you planning for weekends!

The restaurant is located at sector 5.. Just opposite to RDB Cinemas... The place can be easily reached.. A minute walk from Infinity Building...

The ambience is good... We went for buffet.. Starters were average... Chicken reshmi kabab was not at all good.. There was a preparation of prawn... It was awesome.. Mutton preparation in starter was also good...

Coming back to course.. There were plenty of things to eat like rice, dal, salads, crab, fish, chicken, noodles, biriyani and many more...

The main attraction is the desserts.. They are just AWESOME...

P.S. Keep your stomach empty to have the desserts. If you don't, then you are gonna miss it...

Worst experience ever. This is simply the worst restaurant I have been to. Obviously I have been there only once as one can understand from the experience. We tried the buffet. All the items had flaws which cant be ignored. Some had taste issues some were chewy and some had foul smell. We got super annoyed and called the manger  he tried to tame us down by offering some Chef special dish which was not good again which pissed us off totally to just pay the bill and leave before any more torturous dish is served before us.

I guess u have a splendid amount of money (incurred from a long onsite stay) in ur wallet..else, this restaurant is simply of no use..service too bad, food items too bad...moreover in 675+tax they dont serve prawn or mutton....even the fish and chicken items are not even close to a descent level as i mentioned in my "chai break" review....so my suggestion would be to cut this crao and turn around (around 12.00 noon)..go to bbq nation..simple!!

Had the worst experience ever..We were given a window seat that had water dripping from the AC vent ,eventually we had to change the table. Management was poor and took around 15 minutes to  repeat the buffet items . The food was not at all satisfactory for the price they are served .Crab and prawn were tasty but chicken and fish dishes were way out of line in terms of quality . 
Overall ocean grill is not a recommended restaurant to visit .

The food doesn't justify the price tag in my view. Been here only once on a buffet treat from office. The kababs were good; can be better. I didn't like the rice or chicken preparation at all. A one timer for sure!

The above held true till today I decided to pay a second visit. The cost part was indeed high but the taste department was way better today! The Thai Fish Cake sticks to my mouth! Will definitely go for a second visit sometime!

I visited Ocean's Grill for lunch on 28th of July. We were not in the mood for a heavy lunch but it was the sudden crave for seafood that drove us there. As the buffet spread did not have enough variety of seafood, we decided on a-la-carte. We ordered the salt and pepper mixed seafood for starters. The assorted stuff were nicely handed out, however the presentation was not noteworthy. Additionally, it was a bit overpriced considering the quantity they offer. However, the good thing was that it was crispy and nicely marinated. After that we had ordered seafood platter regular with lobster. The garlic bread served with it was surprisingly welcome, however there was no garlic flavour in it. In the end, the bread did not help to add any extra flavour to the taste buds. The platter was good in its entirety. There were lots of options and, especially the crab was nicely marinated and hence was delicious. The shells were nice. 

This restaurant has the potential to become a great option for seafood lovers if it concentrates on the variety of seafood availability in the buffet. It might increase the price of the buffet but would do full justice to the name of the joint. Also, a little bit of hand is needed as far as the flavours and the taste of the food goes. I know some restaurants and even shacks in Goa who serve mouth watering seafood delicacies.

Hmmn.. now that was a change. Always wanted to have sea food in kolkata.. So started the food scene with Ocean Grill.. I must say the menu of Ocean Grill is quiet good.. Might not be extensive but the quality is  good. However I believe there menu should be elaborated a little.  The ocean  platter and the sea food pepper and salt was quiet nice.. but it's little but overpriced for the food given. Over all nice .. 3.5

Had the lunch buffet last Sunday. It is located just opposite barbecue nation. So many people go there not getting seats in barbecue nation. But I strongly felt that it is a pretty good restaurant and it should not be a secondary choice. 
Ambience wise was okay. Nothing to write home about. 
Starters were chicken, fish, prawn (2types), some veg stuff. But the bad part was they did not serve the mutton starter and was going on hiding there fault.... From the server to manager..... Until I had a long discussion with the manager.... 
And he admitted that since we arrived at the later half of the buffet it got finished.... Guys please be honest and admit faults rather than trying to hide it.... 
The fish and one of the prawn starters were good 
But the real surprise was main course. Fish, crab,prawn, 2 types of chicken, mutton.... And the best part was the gravy for all of them were so light and tasty. Not those red and oily gravies. Even the veg au gratin and navratan korma was great. Enough supply too. 
Desserts we did not like. Had 5 of them but none were up to the mark. Specially disappointing was the caramel pudding.. Have never tasted something so horrible. 
But overall a nice experience.. Would like to visit some other day.

I went ocean grill for the first time with my one friend and his family. I mainly prefer Barbeque Nation or Chai Break Buffet. This time we move on to this way. Ocean Grill was a good experience, perfect ambience. They serve 4 Non-Veg and 4 Veg dishes. I mainly prefer Non-Veg section where the options were Chicken Tikka, Fish Tikka, Prawn in Chili Mustard Sauce and Lamb Pie. Those were mouth watering.The Chicken and Fish Tikka were average in taste. No comparison with neighbours. The Prawn and Lamb preparations were very tasty. In main course Prawn and Crab were so good. Fish disappointed me a little bit. In desert section Gulab Jamun was good and the rest items are nice. Now move to Ambience section. I am impressed with the ambience and the oceanic environment decoration. The bar is on one side with good arrangements. The staff behavior was pretty good. The price near about 750+ which is a little bit expensive if you compare with others. Overall, it's a good place to have seafood at sector V. 

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 4/5

One of the best places in Kolkata to relish sea food.
The decor is nothing great to talk about.They have tried to give it a look of sea however they have failed to do so.

Now Food ---> When you go there order Ocean Grill's Seafood platter in lemon and butter sauce...its a great platter where you will get small octupuses,pieces of squid,mussels,two big prawns,fishes,2crabs and with garlic bread and herb rice.
Don't go for buffet its not worth at all...

We went for an office lunch in a group of 30 to Ocean Grill for lunch buffet. The ambiance is cozy and beautiful on a rainy day with enormous glass and a nice view. The decor was mindblowing with jelly fish lights and oceanic murals. Coming to the food now..the starters included grilled chicken and fish items, chicken wings in a hot garlic sauce, delicious lamb pie and fried prawns which were really very tasty. The mains had a great variety including mixed seafood, crabs, prawns, fish, spinach chicken and mutton. There were too many items and not possible to taste them all!! Deserts wre pretty good and overall a sumptuous and great experience!! Definitely going back to have the a la carte which is actually FAMOUS and their a la carte menu was very different and way too much choice!

Haha hehe hoho..Have you ever seen any restora where the waiters are too confused regarding what to server,how to serve and when to serve.!!?? Yes, here is one champion restora who will provide you that experience..though the starters are tasty.but you have to wait and ask them to serve the starter again.One tip- tell them you need your complimentary drink before you finish your meal.ideally they believe that you expect the drink after having their main course which taste awfully.Crabs and fish are smelly due to the "i dnt know what" spices they use.very few desert items.
Ambiance is very cozy and nice except the big glass windows.because whenever you will turn your head, u can see the long queue in front of barbeque (those peoples are so smiling though they are in queue.maybe they are smiling looking at you through those big windows).This scenic beauty will drown you in the "ocean of sorrow" (all the waiters also feel terrible for themselves while watching the long queue next door).
So 1point for tasty starter. Half point for smelly fish and crabs and other items.Half point for desert.1 point for the appearance(considering the big window).
Recommended for one time or no time.!!!

This place was a good discovery. We tried their Deviled Crab and Thai Fish Cake. Both dishes were good. The quality of sea food was good. The dressings were nice. They also gave us complimentary dessert from the buffet because I wanted to try it and it was not on the menu. They need to work on their ambiance. The service was good - polite and prompt. I would like to try their sea food platter next time.

We went for the lunch buffet. Though the starters were good the main course wasnt impressive. Some of the items were not timely refilled even though the place wasnt full and not all other guests went for the buffet. The table service of breads and desserts were very slow. Even though the ambience and decor were appropriate there were flies all around which did attack the food. This was not expected from a high end Sector V restaurant.

Dint find anything special/tasty except the Crab:
I had booked a table for two through phone. As we entered the restaurant, the way receptionist welcomed us was very professional and good.
NEXT.....Table was booked at one of the corners. The very first thing v expect before going to a restaurant is cleanliness vch I couldn't find at all. Ambience was pretty normal like in a normal food court. 
NEXT..THE FOOD..V had chosen a buffet..Baby corn was served at first which was of a very different taste with too much of sauce. Then Lamb was served which didn't taste good at all. Starters were very normal and couldn't get the spicy taste from any of those. Tasteless chicken , prawn and paneer. After getting frustrated with the starters Crab was tried vch gave lil justification to the money spent. Had to ask for watermelon and papaya slices after finding an empty bowl. Gulab jamun was too good. Ice cream had vanished totally from the sight. Everything seemed just like a formality, Like u paid and u got something ( doesn't matter about quality and taste)

I was here about a month ago for dinner buffet. I will say that this place is just about average in terms of quality of food and service. But in terms of quantity and variety of items this one is good. There was a large variety of starters and main food, although desserts were limited. The mutton gravy that they served in main course was uneatable, actually undercooked. Starters were good but quality of service was lacking. The staff were not well trained and the space was also not utilized here. Pocket wise also this place is not that good a deal if you compare with other buffet places.

Ocean Grill has filled the void for authentic and comprehensive seafood spread in and around Sector-5..If you are craving for some delicious and unique seafood dishes and don't mind the pocket pinch,this is the place to be..I feel its unique in its Buffet offerings with the inclusions of a n umber of seafood dishes in its spread..The array is huge..you will be literally spoilt by choices..
Coming to the ambiance it is nicely decorated in line with its name..Big fish nets hunging from the roof, motifs of fishes on the wall and the gloosy marbles on the floor all nicely done up..The servers are extremely polite and well informed.. Only issue is they take ages in servings the starters..can be really irritating for repeated helpings in a buffet spread..Coming to the Spread:
-Welcome Drink: Fresh Lime Soda was nicely done..refreshing..
-Soup: Chicken Egg Drop Soup and Vegetable Broth were present.. The chicken soup actually tasted nice,mild,sub tle flavours..
-Starters: 4 Non-Veg and 4 Veg options..Tasted Crispy Babycorn and Veg Spring Roll in veg..In non-veg the options were Chicken Tikka, Fish Tikka, Prawn in Chilli Mustard Sauce and Lamb Pie..Almost all the starters tasted great apart from the Fish Tikka..They provided a grill on the table much like BBQ nations while their Kebabs never tasted as lip-smacking as those of their more famed neighbours..I believe they really need to improve on their quality of Fish served, quite inferior..
The Chicken Tikka also should have been marinated better..The Prawn was absoultely delicious..love the assortment of flavours,specially the blend of mustard with a tinge of sweetness..also quality of Prawns were very good..Lamb Pie came as a surprise..Never expected such great detailing in a Buffet spread with such huge assortments..Spices were properly balanced and Baked to perfection..
Mains: I lost count..6 Non-Veg dishes alongwith Peas Pulao, Veg Noodles, Steamed Rice and other Veg sides..They served Prawn Saffron Curry, Crab Masala, Fish in Barbeque Sauce, Chicken Hot Garlic, Chicken Masala and
Lamb Badami Korma!!!Honestly you can't sample all the items on one visit..
Among the dishes The Crab Masala tasted awesome..A typical south indian coastal dish with strong presence of spices, curry leaves and coconut..Only advise will be to serve some dishes in Crab Meat since it is almost impossible to break the Crab shell seating in a restaurant and scoop out the meat..
The Prawn yet again never dissappoints..Nice,mild saffron gravy...
The Fish however fails again on its quality..It was hard, fibrous the sauce didn't even blend with the flesh..Horrible!!
All the other sides tasted quite nice, craftily prepared..Special mention to the Lamb dish which taste quite different from what you usually taste elsewhere..
Deserts: Undoubtedly the Show-Stopper..the BEST of the lot.. Have tried Buffet at a lot of places but hardly seen such care taken to prepare the Desert srpead.. Each item was prepared with utmost perfectionism and quite distinct than what offered at other regular Buffet joints.. I have never seen such great Profiteroles being served in any Buffet spread..Tasted authentic,only issue was getting a bit sticky with time..The Fruit Truffle was the Hero of the spread..loved the nice texture and great assortment of delicious fruits,liked how they used small cubes of mango on top to impart additional flavour....The Gulab Jamun and the Caramel Pudding also tasted nice and perfect..Lastly the Orange Souffle was a great wrap-up for a near perfect meal..
Overall must say the Buffet was unique indeed in its overall offerings..Our cheque comes to Rs..770/- per head and Keep in Mind they Charge almost 28% Tax on their Bill..So a Bit High compared to other joints but worth every penny..
Only advise will be please improve on the quality fo the Fish used..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

Friday evening buffet was good with a good variety of menu. Starters were good but the fish was stale. Baby corn and Prawns in the starters were the best! Chicken, Veg tikka were next best. The main course was delicious with items like Dhania mutton, Chilli garlic noodles. Desserts disappointed! Ice cream was better solid than a milk shake and very far from being an Ice Cream. Gulab Jamun were getting cold. Fruit Truffle was stale. I wish they attended to that section better. It is a mixed first experience

Visisted the place couple of time. First it was long back when it just opened. Last was somedays back. Impressed with the quality of cousines. They do not have many items like babeque nation but quality id definitely better than that. Prawns and crabs were fresh. They prepared lamb pie on our special request as it was big group and had advance booking. Chicken was made to perfection. Main courses were also well made. Desserts were only thing that was bit dissapointing. Otherwise I would have given a higher rating.

If you are a fish lover this is the place to be. Tried the buffet over here and being a fish lover I just loved it. There were starters which contained 2 fish items and one chicken item. Generally the numbers are different in other buffet restaurants around the city. The main course was awesome. And crabs I liked it a lot. Yummie they were. a handful of desserts which is ok.

A Saturday eve in Ocean Grill !!
After an tiring day in office I walked into Ocean Grill with my mates. It was around 5:30 we stepped inside and we were gullied of by the exotic ambience. We were escorted to a sleek lounge attached with the restaurant. It was amazingly cozy, our gang of 5 posed on the soft couches. Within a few sec a waiter came and hosted us, we ordered Malibu shots and Teachers 60 ml for us. The ambience swayed us, blue ceilings lights, comfort sitting, glass encasing, deep-sea themed interior and not to forget the John Denver songs. We all were brimming with happiness after the third round of serving. We all now agreed to have our dinner in the adjoining fine dining hub. We looped into a 6 seat table and opted for the Buffet......... They put a sigree, live table charcoal grill for us, and the flow began !! With 4 four Non-Veg and Veg Starters, consisting Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Fish Mahi Tikka, Crispy Prawn in chilli mustard sauce and others. The veg were equally succulent. The chicken were smoky from outside and juicy from inside the fish were melting in mouth and the prawns were the just right kick to your taste buds. In veg the panner tikka kebab can steal your heart away. Coming to the mains, I always face nuisance when it comes to the mains in the buffet !! But the bolt from the blue for our team was the lucrative mains. The boat buffet table was stacked with a plethora of mouth watering dishes. 5 salads that can act as a perfect accompaniment to the array. The que started with 2 continental dishes, a basic pasta in Napoleanta sauce and Vegetable Augratin, followed by few indian veg dishes like yellow dal, rice, tamatar panner etc. Next was an Indian Pulao, followed by the chinese hakka chowmein, steamed rice, and few other veg sides. We jumped over the Non-Veg selection, It was lined up with Chicken Burmese Curry, Fish in cheese mustard sauce, Mutton Korma, Chicken in Schezwan style, Prawn in Saffron style and whole crabs in Barbeque sauce. All the dishes were delectable and and superb. We were crazy be the taste of the prawn, the crabs were something you can really try out and the fish was as fresh as the others. I was really surprised over such elaborate and exotic arrangement. Coming down to the dessert well one can die for it, and it will be worthy too, French Profit Roles, Orange souffle, Shahi Tukda and others, The shahi tukda was full of nuts and raisins. You can give up your health concerned mind and simply indulge your self in the sin !!!! The buffet was idiosyncratic, it was nothing only Indian or Pan-Asian.... It covered the globe !!! Kept it close to their concept of serving World Inspired Cuisine.
Ambience was extremely good, they kept up the theme of Ocean, abiding by the name, the jelly fish lights added an extra charm over the same. Service was extremely good and if you believe that you're having fine tuned taste-buds !! Mate this place is your ultimate destination.. I bet you can never the leave the place with a grumpy face......... and that's what they want, a smile ¬†!!!
A must try, brilliant presentation and the entire thing will not even burn out a hole in your pocket !!!!! Just go and grab it !!!!!

I am so impressed by the food here that I actually made an effort to sign up with Zomato and do my bit to write a feedback of appreciation for this place. The ambience is mindblowing and the service just fabulous. I live and work in Salt lake and I can vouch for it that this is one of the best eateries in the area. I guess Barbeque nation is just a name that people like to follow but this place being bang opposite is just far better!! Beautiful ocean themed interiors and buffet displayed on a boat structure. Unlimited delicious grilled starters ( the prawns and lamb pie was super!) including sigree at the tables. The Mains have a nice variety including crabs, prawns, chicken, fish , mutton, paneer, mixed veg, pasta, noodles, baked dish. The food is a multicuisine mix and very tasty which is unlikely in buffet restaurants. i have been to barbeque Nations a few times and EVERYTIME the Mains have always let us down!! The desserts included profiteroles, mango mousse, variety of tarts, gulab jamun, cheese cake and icecream! Overall we had a sumptuous delicious meal and I will definitely go back to try their a la carte menu. I just visited their facebook page and the a la carte dishes just look so tempting that we have to go back!!

Threw a party here and not one out of 12 persons complained about the food or drinks.
Nowadays there is a new trend to diluting your drink and serving them at a cheaper price..not here. .
Also if u are 2 guys chilling out try the seats in front of the bar and not a regular table..sometimes the bartender also joins in and adds flavor to your conversation. Prices are high for booze and food is quite amicably priced

You only go to Ocean Grill when you:
(A)
1. Fail to manage a reservation in Barbecue Nation
2. Are too lazy to find another better restaurant which serves grills
3. Are sleepy enough in a lazy afternoon.
4. Are okay compromising on the food quality because you dont want to search any further
5. Want to show the Barbecue Nation guys that you dont care! huh!

(B)
Writing a review for Ocean Grill is easy:

1. ¬†Decor: Tacky
2. Staffs: Confused
3. Food: Bad
4. Complimentary Drinks: Pepsi and Sprite only
6. Crowd: Refer to section A¬†
7. ¬†Value for money: No
8. ¬†Referable: No

(C)

Negative Points: Refer to Section B
Positive Points: Ummmmmmmmmm...... (and continues)

On a cloudy weekday afternoon, right after having given a horrible exam, when Hungry is all I was and food was a dire need, me and my mother decided to try out Ocean Grill. 
The first look is pretty intriguing, with the thoughtfully done interiors to suit the Sea Food theme of the restaurant, contributing greatly to the perfect Ambience. 
Even though there was a pretty elaborate lunch buffet we decided to go for A la Carte considering none of us can eat too much at a go. So we ordered Herb Crusted Oven Baked Bhetki for my maa, and The Ocean Grill Special - Tandoori Prawns in Indian Masala with a side of Naan and Pulao for myself. 
So now, we're anxiously waiting for the food, and it takes like forever to finally reach our table, untill we could just start to hog !
Now let me put this straight. I happen to be quite a foodie and have extensivley eaten outside here, there, everywhere, from street food to 5 stars, be it at Mumbai or Manhattan, and I swear to god this Bhetki had to be the best I had ever tasted. The freshness of the Bhetki, with the oh so perfect herb crust, and the tangy tomato rougate, my my, it was like a burst of flavours in the mouth, heaven for the palate ! I thought I would eat up the entire dish till I realized, that was my mother's order and I needed to save some for her . 
But wait, thats not it, my Prawns thankfully arrived just in time to stop me right there and take me back in awe for a moment. The Size of the prawns were enormous ! For quite some time I was left wondering now how the hell do I even eat them , they're so huge, and 3 if them ? They almost looked like they could eat me up. When we normally order prawns, we usually get the medium sized shrimps that ar char grilled, but this time I had no idea I would get three whole bombastic prawns that were the perfectly defined tandoori. Those prawns made me dig in with both of my hands,  salivating, struggling agaisnt time to dissect to get out the meat, and feed myself with the ever so succulent and very well prepared meat inside the shells. The Tandoori Masala also was so perfect, not just spicy but that char of tandoor with the perfect indian flavour transformed me into food lover's paradise ! 
What is especially appreciable is the kind of attention Ocean Grill pays to the details, in terms of plating, and flavour. I mean who would've expected even the Pulao  on the side, to be so delicious, with a blend of subtle flavours and invigorating aroma. 
At the end of the meal, I was left feeling like I was definitely not going to need any more food for some days now, I had eaten so much. 
And rarely does it happen that we are immensely hungry, and we get served the perfect quality of food, with the perfect quantity , and we eat like nothing else matters. The amazing food makes you forgive and forget about the delay in service, and I think its only so fair to wait, because every moment of the wait was worth it !! 

It'd been long till I had this satiating kind of food, and I would absolutely love to come back and even want to travel all the way to sector 5 from South Kolkata just for the love of food ! Till next Time :)

Shit!! All my money went into dumpyard.I think like me everyone think of eating a little bit different and fall in the trap eventually.Most of the food were so bad especially crabs, fishes,prawns and some desserts that we literally put them in the mouth and we just threw it off immediately.The salads were dry and bitter and must be of a day before. It was really a bad experience and a night not worth remembering where we put the ocean in our mouth and threw it out because "they were salty".

Visited Ocean Grill for the first time yesterday with Dad. It is a themed restaurant and the ambience is pleasant.

Since the Alacarte was pricey, we decided to go for the buffet. Okay, so first of all, the spoons were dirty and we had them changed. Secondly, among the grill preparations, the prawn and chicken kebab was great. The paneer kebab was okayish. The lamb cupcake was great.

Now, there was a fish kebab called Basa fish which was stinking. The manager said he'll give us a different preparation. When it arrived, the smell of the fish alone almost made me puke. I don't know who would have that and I am NOT exaggerating. 
The variety of buffet was less for its price and the only stuff edible was in the veg section. The dishes were badly prepared and it did not taste nice. Not once have I eaten outside and had to say "it tastes awful" but yeah, there's always a first I guess.

The dessert section was great though and the staff was hospitable.

Overall, the experience was not good and I am not going there again. I love food and I would have to say that this is probably the worst place yet I that I have eaten.

Gives a feeling of a sea side place untill unless looks outside the glass walls :p .
I had buffet in the lunch time here.
The starters were good .
I had mustard prawn i loved it mainly, chckn fish starter are ok ok.Veg starter were not even par the level.
Main course is good. The birayni or the mutton tastes great.
The worst part is the dessert you will be disgusted by it rather.
Price for buffet is reasonable
Overall u can give it a shot :)

It was a Sunday afternoon, so my husband and I decided to skip cooking and grab a meal at a restaurant instead. Orginally, we planned on going to Barbeque Nation but, they were overbooked. The nearest place was Ocean Grill and from the reviews on Zomato, it seemed quite decent. Well, what a mistake!

Firstly, the ambience is okay, nothing all that 'wow'. In fact, the ceiling lights are pretty creepy.

Coming to the food, it was tasteless and pathetic. My husband being a vegetarian, I got to taste both, the veg and non veg starters. The prawns were cooked with too much mustard, the fish was stale and hard. The chicken was ok and I skipped on the mutton. My poor husband had to endure hard paneer and insipid veg chops. The main course was no better. We decided to play safe and had the ice cream for desert.

Lastly, the staff need to be prompt and attentive to the diners.

I don't think I would ever visit this place again. Being a seafood lover, it was a huge disappointment. Waste of time and money.

Well, well, well... a wise man once told that an ocean is a way of nature giving us goodies..and after visiting this place...I got what he meant. Undoubtedly, Ocean Grill is the best restaurant I've been to, this year. The ambience was nonchalant and by that, I mean lovely. The quality of seafood is superb and the staff is friendly. If I was compelled to give a suggestion, I would say that the plates are a bit short for eating seafood..but other than that, I've got nothing else to say. The view is lovely is an ideal place to indulge in beauties of the sea. They've held their end in planning a meticulous menu for the buffet for lunch..and the staff, at intervals, asked how the food was, showing that they are open to criticism. I would love to visit again.

The food down there is great but I'd recommend people not to try the Prawn Cocktail but its personal choices so to be honest I did not like the Prawn Cocktail as it was effed up. The ambience is downright excellent and the service is one of the best in town. So, in my opinion, you gotta give it a try.

The thing that will catch your notice is the intricate decoration and silent and cozy ambience. The service was excellent. The waiter literally stood by my side asking if I needed anything else (patiently, because of my voracious nature, lol :-p ). The food was delicious and of good quality. The seafood cuisines were above excellence. Overall my whole family enjoyed a lovely lunch. :-)

Take the concept from Barbeque Nation and then dilute it to keep it at a price offering as per the market. What is the result? Ans - Ocean Grill! It is again one of those places which borrow or steal the concept from a successful one but fail to deliver mainly because of the service than the lack of punch as compared to the Original place. Limited options taste good but let's down completely by everything else. Not sure how much the lesser price justifies the lesser delivery.

We went to ocean's grill with my family and some relatives. Overall experience was amazing. Buffet arrangement was tip top. Food was of typical seaside flavour of which I am a big fan. Ambience is truly amazing and food is delicious. A touch costly but it does justice with its quality. I strongly recommend Ocean Grill. Go for it!!

Been there yesterday afternoon with a small group of office colleagues . The place was quite full but we were received courteously and within a few moments were comfortably seated . We opted for the buffet spread at it looked tempting . Soon the starters arrived one after the other .Each item was warm & tasty . The Staff was extremely courteous and we were glad to know this was one restaurant where the owners personally supervise each aspect & had a vigilant eye on each table to ensure customer delight . 
The main course was sumptuous and we really indulged ourselves¬† to our heart's content . 
Desserts were quite varied but the Ice cream was missing . We were looking forward to some Ice cream in the afternoon . No sooner we mentioned this Ice Cream was served on our table ! 
We browsed through¬† menu and were excited aat the wide variety . We sure look forward to be back for the a la carte !

Hey guyz are you serious that you are doing business. My question is why you charge a customer when you don't want to serve for what you have opened so called eating place. Ocean grill seriously need to change their I must say everything. Food,Hospitality, Furniture everything. A big boo for now as I am a big dissatisfied customer.

Me and my friend wanted to experience some exotic sea food so we thought of having it at ocean grill. Since zomato mentioned that buffet starts at 12:30 we ended up there at 12:35 on 18.05.15. And the staffs were not ready with the buffet spread (not accepted for a restaurant like ‚Äúocean grill‚Äù). 

We ordered OCEAN GRILL SPECIAL SEA FOOD PLATTER with LOBSTER and non-veg buffet.

The waiter who took our order was just got up from his sleep (it was legible from his face) 

which was not accepted!

We asked about the details of sea food platter and buffet. Waiter explained briefly with his sleepy face. And order for complimentary drink was taken. After some 5min I noticed ocean grill employees showing up one by one. Initially there was only 3 people (the person who took our order, lady at the reception and one more guy).

¬†After this starters were served:

¬†fish tikka, chicken tikka, prawn shot, crispy chilly baby corn, and some corn item.

To be honest starters were not up to the mark for a restaurant like ocean grill (I had better crispy chilly baby corn in roadside eat outs. It was hard so I went on chewing on it). And lacked variety (so ended up ordering one more round of fish tikka & chicken tikka ). Not satisfied here.

By this time SEAFOOD PLATTER had arrived

just by looking at it I realised the mistake of ordering it.

It consisted of 3 medium size crab cooked with medium seasoning, 7-10 small prawn which was not cooked properly, 3 large prawns which tasted very bland, 3 octopus & 6-8 squids  ‚Äì felt like chewing on a rubber while eating(guys just go to Ecstasea and have octopus there u would come to know how it should taste and feel), 3-6 half‚Äôs of  mussels/clams  which didn‚Äôt had any meet in it (photo attached) so couldn‚Äôt eat it, two  2.5‚Äô‚Äô width fish meat which was not bad, cup of herb rice I didn‚Äôt even try it, 4 garlic bread which was good, and finally one 10‚Äô‚Äô long lobster which was  cooked without any seasoning which lacked flavour and the meet was  rubbery,. We just had the tail part and didn‚Äôt want to try head part it was unappealingly bland. - disappointed here.

By this time I had lost my interest to continue eating,

In main course section: 

lamb was juicy and mouth-watering, chicken, prawn, fish, crab, paneer, fried rice and veg items as usual, were good.  Ordered some roti and had some of the above items and got some taste back in my mouth. ‚Äìjust satisfied here.

Salad‚Äôs and fruits were limited & it was wrapped in plastic wrapper, no one served me so i didn‚Äôt have those (didn‚Äôt wanted to mess with plastic wrap).

Desserts:

loved the hot gulab jamun, cakes and pastries were average.

I had to enquire about the availability of ice-cream, unfortunately only vanilla flavour was available. Had one scoop of ice-cream & nothing was great about it.  And ended our meal.

Verdict- my expectations were high but I was disappointed. Food is the main thing to me and if it is not good everything goes down with it same thing happened here. I failed to enjoy the ambiance.

Music was on the louder side and someone kept changing the songs too frequently. (We sat on the corner seat near the glass wall and the speakers there was worn out hence quality of music was bad)

Waiters were friendly did their best possible. (But only when asked ‚Äì we had to ask them to refill our water, they cleared our plate only when we asked to, spoon and forks were only given on request)- didn‚Äôt expect this kind of service.

Now I know why ocean grill is rated only 3.5.

We decided to go to BQ Nations. But there was a considerable amount of wait time .So we tried Ocean Grill and we were not disappointed. Entering Ocean Grill, was quite impressed with the ambiance and the Oceanic environment decoration. ¬†Staff behavior was good and the overall experience was quite pleasing.We went for buffet.Starters were good spl the chicken kebabs.Next we had main course spl the veg main course was delicious and we had some kind of mushroom sauce creamy fish preparation which blew us away.Dessert was a disappointment.Lack of options and not so good ,there was no ice cream.All in all 600 rs worth.I will definitely recommend my friends to go there once.

Where was this place? Nobody even thinks about it..... Well one disadvantage being right in front of barbeque nation..... This place sets a new standard in Kolkata itself. Barbeque nation although has made its place. This joint definitely deserves recognition. Me and my fianc√©e went on a hot sultry afternoon and were astonished to see the service, food quality and ambience. Mind blowing, the char grilled crab with garlic bread, potato mash and veggies. The lobster was the star, cooked perfectly, sweet inside. The fried fish is an absolute complement to beer. Anyone who hasn't been here must be....

After coming out of RDB cinemas watching a movie, decided to go to Barbbeque Nations. But the Ocean Grill opposite to RDB caught our glimpse and decided to try out there. Entering Ocean Grill, was quite impressed with the ambience and the Oceanic environment decoration. The bar is on one side with good arrangements. First we  ordered the Ocean Grill special non-veg soup having crab meatvwhich was just awesome with a completely different taste. Next we tried the Devilled Crab dish which was too good. It had 5 crab pieces with crab meat stuffed in the shell. Loved the preparation. Lastly we had the Nasi Goreng which is a type of non-veg fried rice and we liked it too. Staff behaviour was good and the overall experience was quite pleasing.

The first brownie point for the place is its prime location.it never gets unnoticed.the ambience is good. Bt the waiters r lack of hospitality and training and r really clumsy at times.they seve welcome drink so little tht nxt time they cn easily opt fr a teQuila- serving shot glass.they dont serve enough starters infct they tend to save up those starters fr god knows whom. The main course is ok despite d fact that they mention in d menu tht they will serve u prawn,bt actually they serve small shrimps.i guess they assum that their customers r dolts and cant diferentiate btwn shrimps and prawns.desserts r way too sweet.and d place is costly than barbeque nation. At d end of dining u will leave hungry as hell with a burning hole in ur pocket.btw another brownie point fr the awesome decoration of food which r mostly tasteless.

It's a good place to have seafood at sector 5. The starter was pretty good especially the prawn and fish. Those were mouth watering. The grilled chicken was average. I recommend to have plenty of prawns in the starters ;) Coming to the main course, it was just average. The mutton,crab were the only saving grace. I really liked the desert. The taste n quality of each n every desert was superb. The ambience and staff behaviour was pretty good.

Both the time it was a pleasure
1. Starter was average
2. But prawn and crabs were mouthwatering. Soft, juicy and tasty.
3. Their customer handling is good and service is professional.

In office party I found one chicken curry which was just awesome.

Hii.. today i went for my dinner to ocean grill and would like to share my experience or rather horrible experience with any kind of food . The food was soo bad dat cannot b described .. chicken was not clean and blood stains were der on chicken tikka and no salt . Fish fry was smelling like garbage . Fish tikka was very blank in taste . Soup was just a chicken stock with egg whites. Crabs were so small dat even u finish off d entire bowl u will feel dat u just ate crab shell . Prawn in main cource was as such prawn boiled n served in fish stock... and for such devastating experience i had to pay 4000 for 5 pax. I would rather go to roadside dhaba than going to ocean grill ever. Overall i would rate ocean grill 2 out of 10 . Suggestion for foodlovers never waste ur money n time for ocean grill.

Visited on Poila Boisakh 15, the experience was emblematic of a superb lunch on a special day. We ordered a Burmese Soup - it is a mildly spiced curry flavoured chicken soup. The look of this soup resembled the light ''daal'' preparation. It was relishing and the mix of spices gave the right piquancy making it a unique experience altogether with soups. Coconut flavored chicken pieces just revived my palate. Our next order was Mixed Fried rice and that too got full marks and an item which is worth to be chronicled here. Giving an attention to tummy we ended our food journey with a preparation of Lamb-''Fiery Indian Lamb Curry'' with yoghurt and spices, the requester for this item was my colleague, and thanks to him for choosing such a beautiful dish which was robust in spices, captivating and delectable. 
The servers were quick and helpful, and a lady also kept an eye on each and every customer request, this establishes good co-ordination.
The place is nicely decorated and will give you a feel of an aquarium. 
I will definitely say that it lived up to my expectations, and I enjoyed the food with a lot of love and passion

Had a mixed experience here. Ambiance was very good, staffs were courteous but the food is of average quality. Frankly speaking I liked the starters and desserts more than the main course. Though the main course had many options but they were not that tasty. The restaurant is very big and spacious but sadly it was totally empty during our one hour stay between 7.30-8.30 pm on a holiday.

Woke up late - had to meet friends - skipped breakfast : It was time for 'brunch'. 
I remember the day as it was India's world cup opener against Pakistan. We wanted to taste good sea food while watching India take on their neighbours in #wc15.

There were no grills though. The starters mainly comprised kebabs, chicken lollipops, prawns and fish. We were indeed expecting more variety in sea food, going by the place's name :) I would also like the availability of ice cream flavours.

I did like the decor and the service provided by the staff. I wouldn't be able to comment on the ambience and the atmosphere for the place on that very day as you cannot but expect an 'electric crowd' when its India v/s Pakistan !

P.S. - dont forget to click a pic infront of the shark! (Y)

I did not like the place much. You can spend just as much and have much better experience servicewise and foodwise at Barbeque Nations.¬†

On normal days this place is generally not very crowded. The service is sweet but we had to keep telling them about the second round of starters before they arrive. Our welcome drinks came very late, when we were almost done with the main course. The main course is interesting and nice. The dessert section again disappointed me. They dont even keep ice cream.¬†

Overall, not very satisfactory but for the love of sea food, one should try this place maybe.

I wish i could have another 5 stars to rate them.
With in one and half weeks, we had dinner there 3 times..addicted! Lol! Thanks to the staffs, cooks, and of course the owner Mr.Shane,(one of the most amicable person i have met)
Coming to the dishes, you will have plenty of things to try out.buffet is available  at 599 only and a  la carte is also available. I generally love to go for a la carte.
As We are Hardcore seafood lovers, so we tried Sea food platter. Amazingly excellent.(crab/tiger prawn,octopus,shell,herbs,thai fish,shrimps etc in sufficient quantities) I tried in Thai and Indian style at different times. 
Apart from platters, you can have almost authentic Thai(yellow/green/red curry), Malaysian(lamb masan curry), vietnamese dishes  and lot more.
In dessert also you get to have very very tasty items..
I tried Kiramisu and other two, forgot the names.
Also There is lounge . I liked the shark which is engraved in the wall. Ambiance is amazing.
You can have choices on mock-tails and cocktails. Base you can customize.
Drinks also you can have anything and everything. i prefer whisky as always.
And there is an aquarium with live fishes/ prawn/crabs etc.You choose it they cook it:
Thats all! Lot more to try. Looking for excuses.;-)

The name intrigued me more than anything to make me visit this place. Firstly I got a call from this place that they would offer me a 50% off on buffet and when I went there they told me that the place was booked and I should have called them. They promised that I would be able to avail the same discount at a later date and they extended the date. Then after a few days when I called them, I was told that the place was under renovation. Thus ended my opportunity to have the discounted buffet.

Then a few days back I went there and I have to say, the experience is not really worth reliving. 

Firstly in the dark lounge, I completely missed the small part in the menu where it is stated that the standard measure for liquor here is 30 ml which is mostly not case elsewhere.

Also, the Salt and Pepper Mixed Seafood is just horrible. Moreover the quantity, when you compare it with the price is a big let down.

The only good thing? The sprite was complimentary.

BTW the ambiance was cool and the staff was good too. That's where they scored the 3 points.

We went there for an office party. The restaurant has a beautiful vibrant interior and ambiance. The place was full however the service of the staff was extremely pleasing. We were in a group of 20 people and were seated along the windows. The welcome drinks came along within a few minutes. We went for the buffet. For starters (4 veg and 4 non veg)we had Greek/Italian style meat balls, mahi grilled fish, grilled juicy chicken pieces , crispy chilli baby corn and all the starters were delicious and extremely filling. For Mains the lamb Lasagne was absolutely yumm. The variety of dishes for the mains was great. Some of the items included spicy crabs, baked mixed vegetables, stuffed chicken roulade, grilled fish, polenta, Live pasta counters etc.. We were absolutely spoilt for choice. The best part was the deserts ofcourse for which this place has been very popular- warm brownies, caramel custard, cakes and super profiteroles (Italian desert ‚Äì with fresh cream filling) which the staff mentioned were all baked in house. I will definitely go back to try their a la carte menu.

Coming to the food part- we chose to go wid d buffet....except for the lamb pie and hot garlic prawns evrything in the starters was worse than thought......
Main course was ok types, they served crab but no tool to break it......dint understnd wat was mutton rogan josh doin in oceans grill....was expecting squids and octopus in the menu but dint get any.....
Coming to the desert part....the gulab jamun's syrup froze to sugar layering on the top....whrn asked to get another serving never heard from them anymore.......few deserts were good...but again overall the experience was not at all great

Will ignore coming to this place in future

Visited this place a couple of days back to celebrate my friends birthday. I had heard quite a lot about this place. So we decided to give it a go. Firstly. We were the only people in the whole restaurant! That was a shock. We opted for the buffet. First they kept serving us the veg starters whereas we had opted for the non veg ones. The crsipy chilly baby corn was overcooked. A paneer pakora was served which waa tasteless and impossible to eat as it kept breaking down. Then they gave us the lamb pie. Which was so and so. After almost 20 minutes they brought in the array of kebab. Alu kebab,chicken and fish kebab and prawn kebab. That's it ! And guess what. When we asked for the second round they took another 20 minutes! I was furious! Main course had crabs,mutton,chicken. None of them were worthy of calling food. I had lost hopes by then. Thankfully rhe desserts made up for it. Pocket pinch for 2 is 1500+
Really dissapointed .

A belated thanks to Sen da and Boudi for giving us a lovely treat and gifting us a wonderful evening at Ocean Grill, an upcoming restaurant in and around Saltlake. The food was awesome and quite innovative. Our best wishes for the Chef Shane Chatterjee, who always likes to experiment with spices and sauces. Though this eatery specialises in continental dishes, its chinese cuisine is equally authentic and worth mentionable. Hope to enjoy some more innovative dishes in near future.

We live in Salt lake and happened to visit this place recently after my wife received a free meal voucher on his birthday as her name was in their database. We went for the buffet. The vast spread of starters, mains and deserts will definitely make you over eat! Great value for money , tasty food and great service. Cant complain really and will go back considering we live in Salt lake as well.

I would call it an excellent addition to kolkata's fine dining circle. I highly recommend their sea food platter, prawn cocktail and lamb steak. The staff is very courteous. The whole ocean theme decor made the meal even more appealing. Looking forward to going back again.

I loved the buffet here. The welcome drink they served was perfect. Although the name is Ocean Grill, they hardly serve any grilled items. But their seafood preparation (crab, prawn, basa fish) were pretty good. Both the starters and the main course were well cooked and tasty. Both the chicken and mutton dishes were mouthwatering. I even liked the non-veg dishes, although I am not a very big fan of non-veg. lastly, they had 5 kinds of dessert including mousse, cheesecake, caramel custard, ice-cream ¬†and gulab jamun. Sweet.

Overall rating :4.5
Ambiance: 3.5

Visited this place on my birthday with some of my friends. Team Ocean Grill made my day! Loved this place and its awesome decor! I have heard that this place is remarkable for the Awesome Seafood collection. It was my wish to try some of the seafood collection. So we tried for a-la-carte.
Things I liked-
1. Oceanic Interio Decoration concept and behavior of the staffs.
2.Regarding food, I have tried seafood platter (Continental Style) and chicken pepponata with herb rice. And I enjoyed! Variety in seafood platter is really great. All the seafoods (Crabs, Lobster, Squid, Brassels, octopus) are hot, well cooked and had a unique taste. I loved it with garlic bread!

Chicken Pepponata was great and chicken balls were perfectly cooked having bell pepper, spinach hiding inside it . Herb rice was okay.¬†
3. Regarding Drink, ordered virgin mojito and young lady (Mocktails). It was great!

Things I disliked-
Nothing at all. I liked everything.

Things Can be improved-
Everything is great. If you can reduce your food preparation time, I guess that will be excellent.

Coming to dessets, when I was going to order for deserts, to my ultimate surprise, Shane and Sumana (Owners) gifted us with a birthday cake. It was awesome.¬†
It was a wonderful day @ Ocean Grill. I would love to go there next time and try the buffet. Thanks Ocean Grill!

Unlike most of the foodies at the Ocean Grill , I did not went to taste their popular buffet. I am an avid  seafood lover and I went mainly to taste their seafood.  I must say I was more than satisfied. Finally  i found a REAL sea food joint at Kolkata, which prompted me to write my first review in Zomato. My earlier experience of the place was not good ( 1 year ago), but under the new management the place has undergone a sea of change from food to decor. 

i started with fried prawns and then almost nose dived into their Seafood platter which is dirt cheap and impossible to be devoured alone. The platter comes with plenty of crabs, prawns, mussels, sea bass, clams, squid and octopus. One can get the dish in various styles too. I tried the dish with plenty of sauce and it was yummy. You can add Lobster to the dish at an extra price.

In fact Ocean Grill has a full octopus dish and even a fried lobster too, which I am definitely going to try in my next visit.

The next item I had was a fried mixed seafood which had fried crab meat, octopus to squid. It was not heavy as seafood platter and goes very well with a drink.

I ended with  desserts consisting  of Profiteroles, Creme Caramel Custard and Orange Souffle.

Ocean Grill is definitely a must visit destination especially  for sea food lovers !

Things we liked-the oceanic decor :p spcly the jellyfish lights and the engraved crab motiff on the floor.
The desserts..though I couldn't taste all of them as we went in quite late ..towards the end of the buffet timings..we went there unplanned and without any prior research.
The oyster item
The Budweiser
The staff at service were good but the ladies at the reception weren't courteous.
Things we didnt-too crowded to my taste
The buffet items had all gone cold..so make it a point to visit early at around 12.30 pm when it starts.
The crab wasn't remarkable.the chilly fish was worse than what we had had at a roadside eatery.
I want to return to taste the seafood platter.one certainly wants to try octopus.

If you are looking for seafood in Kolkata, this is the place to be. Wide variety of seafood in ala carte as well as buffet menu. Suggest you try the seafood platter, tandoori style. It contains all the grilled kebabs from the menu including lobster, crab, octopus. Had a nice time over there during dinner at weekend.

Went to Ocean Grill with my husband for dinner last Sunday and had an excellent dining experience after ages.with lip smacking dishes,aesthetically done interiors living upto the theme of the restaurant,splendid ambience and the impeccable service of the staff made the whole experience worth trying..what added more to the experience was the constant presence of the restauranteur at the restaurant helping every guest to choose the right dishes according to one's tastebuds and providing a customised dining experience to the guests.
Must try dishes are the lamb steak and the sea food platter...
I would highly recommend Ocean Grill to everyone who have an appetite for quality food with international standards of presentation and hygiene....

The name is ocean grill but the food really does not go by the great name . We had ordered a few sea food dishes but sorry to say that it looked good but the crabs were stale as it had a peculiar smell and on bringing it to the manager 's notice I was informed that it was perfectly ok . Anyhow I had visited the place on a friend's recommendation and I decided not to go back again. The decor however was good. But actually that is secondary.

I went out for dinner with my family yesterday and was suggested by our server to try the buffet,priced at 750 with Tax food quality was not up to the mark.To start with starter's were decent followed by main course which was far from being good,I had my plate full but could not manage to finish even one dish completely and then desert which was a disaster in making caramel custard made so bad I cant think of eating it ever again.
Final verdict it's a big NO NO.
Not recommended at all.

While passing down Sector V , the signage of this restaurant attracted us . I wasn‚Äôt even aware this restaurant  existed here on the 1st floor of Infinity Benchmark Building . As we went up the elevator on the lobby to the 1st floor , we were welcomed by the  hostess of Ocean Grill . The  oceanic themed interiors ,  I am sure , would be a delight for all , particularly the young at heart . 

The place has a restaurant as well as a separate lounge . They offer Buffet as well as a la carte . The buffet pricing was reasonable but did not have many sea food items . As this was our 1st visit we decided to settle for the Buffet . We were amazed when the Chef mentioned the array of  deserts  offered with the buffet are made in house.  The profiteroles were out of the world ! 

While chatting with the friendly young Chef , who owns this place ,  we were told they have a variety of sea food in continental preparations in their a la carte menu . We browsed through the  Menu and found the prices quite attractive . The new lounge looked comfortable and cosy . 

I look forward to coming back to this place for trying out the continental sea food specials !

As residents of Rajarhat ,  Newtown , we were looking at options where we could enjoy a family dinner over the weekend .  A  neighbour jokingly suggested trying out the food zone in Sector V , Salt Lake , fondly referred to as the ‚ÄòManhattan of Sector V‚Äô   This was the area around the Multiplex , RDB Boulevard . 

We located this place Ocean Grill , tucked on the 1st floor of the Food Court of  Infinity Benchmark. A relatively new restaurant , clean and nicely furnished interiors . The place wasn‚Äôt very crowded. We spent some time in the newly created Lounge ,relaxed on the sofas ,  munching on the array of starters and washing them down with the drinks . The service was professional and the staff soon made us feel  at home .  The Menu had a large variety of  Continental dishes, quite moderately priced ,  and we  were initially little apprehensive as what would be the quality of the serving . 

We tried the  Herb crusted oven baked bhetki &  lamb steaks with a creamy mushroom and rosemary sauce,. The portions were generous and the presentation had a touch of professionalism .  The taste was awesome and although we were initially little upset at the time taken to serve ( it took about 20 mins ) , we felt it was worth the wait . 

The Chef was around and personally checked with us regarding the preparation  and was happy to share the recipe as well ! I am sure he must have kept something up his sleeve .  On the whole we had a wonderful experience .

A wonderful restaurant where you can sample cuisine from all over the world! Been there very recently and the experience was very very good. The chicken roulade came with a delicate yet flavorful mushroom sauce and the Lamb steak was divinely soft and succulent. THE BEST dish that we had here is the Grilled Basa marinated in Indian Spices from the live fish counter. I am yet to taste a more buttery, melt-in-your mouth fish. The food overall was very heartwarming. And me being a dessert person, I have to mention the profiteroles, which were absolutely yummy. Thank you Ocean Grill, will keep coming back for more.

Went with my family on January 23rd (a bit late to write the review). The food was quite decent both in terms of quality and flavour. Although a little expensive (eh well whaddya expect?). 'Deviled Crab' is an interesting little piece of work and definitely worth trying. The 
The interior decor was pretty cool too. The mixed seafood main course could use a little work though (like removing the shell from the crab and a little more squid).
Service was quite satisfactory. 
Not at all a bad place to try out.

It was a great moment visiting Ocean Grill on a Sunday evening. I had invited few of the celebrity guests for evening dining ¬†for ¬†whom I was looking for a cozy, cool, decorative restaurant with exceptional food. I was suggested for Ocean Grill in Salt Lake Sector V opposite RDB Cinema Halls. I was amazed seeing the ambiance, the lounge and lobby. The interior decoration, the spacious Lobby, the private lounge made me spell bound. Each of the interior decoration and furnishing marks for an outstanding art and taste. The guests were impressed. ¬†But natural, I was happy at the start. Then came the Chef, ¬†Shane with the Menu Card for food and drinks. He suggested some signature foods and chef's specialty. We were good number of people. Each one had different taste and choice - right from typical Bengali food to Continental, Italian, Mexican, Australian and above all the sea food platters and combinations. The Octopus, Squid, Jumbo Lobster, Big Size Crab were really unique by taste. With the starter of veg and non veg varieties, Mocktails and cocktails were wonderfully made and served. We were impressed with the hospitality and warmth of the stewards and the Chef. Eventually we came to know that Ocean Grill was a chef owned restaurant. At last came the desserts. We were told to taste the desserts and confectionery made in the bakery of the restaurant. Those were mouthwatering. After enjoying for few hours, we all left with ¬†filled heart and stomach. Satisfaction came at last when the bill reached me. I was taken to surprise that the prices were very reasonable. I wish I go again and again to Ocean Grill. I request my friends to make a try. Kudos Management of Ocean Grill.

Having heard of this newly renovated restaurant from a friend, I visited last Friday along with my family. ¬†The interior has been tastefully done up on a Ocean Theme which created a very cheerful & pleasant environment. ¬†The staff were extremely courteous and the variety of grilled and continental food was really good and value for money. ¬†I was told the present management is headed by an young chef who has been trained & working in Australia for almost a decade. ¬†We could feel his passionate touch all over the place.¬†

So I went to this place this sunday along with a couple of friends to watch the India vs Pakistan match and have a good lunch.

The place turned of descent but I had a little more expectations from it, especially the name is Ocean Grill, and we found only a single grilled item from the ocean.

The starters included chicken lollypop, grilled fish, sik kebabs, prawns and a fish cake.

The fish cake was not that great, other that that the other starters were okay.

The main course was good and the deserts were descent too, though there was no ice creams.

The service from the staff is excellent and the place has a nice d√©cor.

It was 11:30 in d nite and i happened to cross Oceans Grill, hoping to find a place which is open for late nite dinners....thankfully it was open...
The first thing you will notice is its decor....the whole place was overlapped with a light blue light with pics and showpieces of fishes giving an Ocean type ambience.
They serve buffet dinner as well where the food was kept on a boat shaped structure, however we decided to go for ala carte.
Even if we were the last guest we were showed in and given details of d menu and its availability like we were d first ppl to enter.
We decided to go for herb crusted fish and chicken peri peri, coupled with Long island Tea...
I would say that the food was really good,starting from d presentation till d quality. The fish was cooked just right and the peri peri sauce was the right kind of mild as we wanted.
I was also surprised by d price as it was quite affordable.
Hence i would recommend this place for all those who likes continental cuisine.

There are times when you blame the restaurant for a bad evening/afternoon; a lunch at this joint, for me, was pretty much the same... I don't know whether they're always serving average quality food at above-average prices, or is it just that, their location at the vicinity of BarbequeNation always results in constant comparison with the latter, resulting in even more devastating consequences for customers and staff alike(the peer-pressure syndrome)... Again, that's no reason for inconsistency in service... 

Now, for the ratings, Ambiance: 8/10(only thing worth mentioning), Food: 4/10, Service: 6/10, Pricing: 3/10...

Now, for some mentionable dishes: Alas, there are no such dishes worth mentioning that I can remember... But there was a shocker dish in the dessert section(I had the buffet lunch); there, literally, were slices of what looked like Britannia Fruit Cakes, with Kissan Mixed Fruit Jam splattered on top of them(and I'm not making this up, one bit)... 

It's high time, the management of Ocean Grill realize that an individual's top priority in case of restaurant-hunting is the food, and not the ambiance, 99% of the time...

So better buck up!!!!

I have never been a buffet person so having to opt for one to chose from a variety of sea foods disheartened me . food cooked hours ago and served in  buffet spoils the authenticity of sea food . Apart from that even the Crabs and prawns were too sweet to taste . Will return once again  to try the  al a carte and hope that the quality will be better than the quantity  served .

This is the review of my second visit.May be I was too lazy to write a review after eating a lot.

So,That was our office outing,a group of 25 people,visited Ocean grill few days back.

Speaking truly, atmosphere has deteriorated a lot though they have a added a new lounge corner. Staffs are not at all well trained. Both of the times, I have found they run into lack of proper training and it reflects to their servings etiquette badly.

Now,food!! Food was not so i-am-dying-for.In starter,they served Panner Pasinda and Spicy grilled chicken.Panner Pasinda was good(smashed paneer between two breads),but spicy grilled chicken was really over-spicy though it was tender and soft.Corn soup was also served.
In main course,we got corn rice,plain rice(both of them were good),chicken masala(was good),some kind of assorted vegetable dish(baby corn,carrots and other stuffs tossed in some Masala),fish in curd(totally tasteless!!),paneer gravy(forgot the name,but was good in taste). Altogether,everything was more than ok except the Fish item.
Then we got ice cream and golabjamun.Golabjamun was awesome and perfect.They served prawn cocktail - boiled prawn cut into pieces and served with mayonnaise,it seems) which was not that great.

Bottom Line : food was not that great as per the price they had charged!! I will surely suggest them to train the staffs well!!

Went there on 1st of January with 3 friends. Location of this restaurant is great, just opposite of RDB. Ambiance and decor is good and there is a lot of space in this restaurant. Now coming to food, i am slightly disappointed. They served chicken kebab, seafood cake, fish tikka and prawn kebab in starters, out of these fish tikka is only up to the mark. I am a crazy fan of prawn but i ate only 4. In the main there was two types of rice, one oyster dish, one mutton dish, one fish... and the new year special roasted turkey and duck. A bad smell was coming out of oyster, mutton was very hard to chew, turkey was like a piece of stone. Only i liked the roasted duck. Dessert was good.
Service: in service they will get -1/5. They didn't served the complimentary drink until we were asked for it. Service of starters was horrible. Chicken and fish kebab came after 15 min of asking and prawn came after 20 min. And 2nd time, the prawn didn't come, i think ocean grill likes to use the word "buffet" but they don't know the meaning of the word. They were too lazy to clean the starter plate from our table, they cleaned after telling many times.
Be care-full, they will not serve ice cream if you don't tell them.
Overall, bad experiences from a well known restaurant. This is my last visit. 
Thank you.

Pros :

Ambiance was good..
Starter , main course and desert was equally good.  Specially main course was very good compared to the similar restaurants.

Cons:

Service is average. Sometime you will be ignored and they will be too late. Number of attendants is not sufficient as i felt.

Booked a table for 3 on 31st Dec for 9.30 pm. Reconfirmed by personally visiting. When reached & asked for table at 9.30 pm was shown booking at 10! Young lady with whom reconfirmed allowed us in the lounge when in charge refused citing booking at 10. 
We sat at lounge with the promise of getting a table asap. This never happened.
For the price food , quality ( cold) , variety & service were poor. The in charge can also be more polite & ensure proper service.

I went to this place on 31st eve for a Dinner Buffet. Firstly, the service was exceptionally poor. We sat for 15 minutes in our table and nothing was served to us except water, although the restaurant was only half occupied at that time. All the waiters came once and asked what would we like to have but nobody initiated with the starters. Eventually I had to call the Manager and he came to our rescue. We got some Chicken Tikka & Fish Tikka and then the restaurant Manager & Waiters forgot that we were sitting in their premises. It was happening with everybody. Till 45 minutes, I had hold my patience for Prawn Tikka, Crab Cakes and other Sea Food starters for which people go to Ocean Grill but nothing turned up except for hopes of "2 minutes Mam!!!"

Eventually I could see everybody getting up and moving towards the main course. I didn't know that even worse was yet to come. The Chicken Soup was even worse than that of a Government Hospital. Crab size was microscopic and was tasteless. Fish in honey and mustard sauce tasted worse than shit. And the Roasted Duck & Turkey - well you need teeth made to steel to chew them.

All this @1800/- for 2 persons.

Overall, I had a pathetic experience at Ocean Grill on 31st eve and I would never go there for sure and also not recommend anybody.

Went there for a sunday brunch as part of our surgery unit treat. Starters were. Served promptly and efficiently.. lacked in what may be called true "oceanic" delicacies. Main course was disappointing.desserts was even more so. better to tey the a La carte here. With bbq nation bang opposite to compete with..this buffet is not even close. DISAPPOINTED.

Absolutely amazing discovery. 

Met the owner - He's a passionate ex-pat chef from Australia with a brilliant team working with him. 

Location - at the central food hub of sector V, it is very easily locatable for a new visitor. Just opposite the RDB adlabs cinema. Ample parking all around even on busy days which is a big plus.

Ambiance - very pleasant,  comfortable and with the right hint of peppy-ness.

Food - The food definitely lives up to the theme. The seafood here is amazing. Prepared really well. Cooked delicately with the right hint of spices and sauce.

While they frequently have a buffet spread to cater to the IT customers. If u get a chance, do try ordering from ala carte menu directly. 

Personally glad that this addition has come up to the kolkata sea food scene (which was a bit lacking in non-bengali side). Hope they do well.

I had actually planned to visit Barbeque Nation for a midweek dinner but since it was crowded, I chose Ocean Grill to save myself from waiting in the queue standing outside.

It was my first visit to this restaurant and I liked the aqua theme of this place. I dont like crowdy places and this restaurant was quite vacant which I liked.. I chose buffet and it was a decent choice with a menu of approx 10-12 items. Liked the starters especially the prawns and the main course was delightful with the presence of seafoods i.e., crabs, clams and shrimps. Since the theme of the restaurant was about ocean food, i think they could have added more seafood dishes like Sushi rather than the conventional chicken and mutton which is available anywhere. However, i do understand that they have to cater customers and suit their needs and many people do not like fish to that extent.

Would like to visit this place once again with my family and this time for a family dinner :)

Recently I went to Ocean Grill with my family. While the main steward is courteous and quick about parking issues, the waiters are really ill informed. Despite my wife's request for non-presence of corrainder leaves in Tom Yum Soup, they were readily floating around. I had asked for a Chicken A la Kiev.. What came was just a cutlet..with no apologies. Decor is nice but that's all.. Not much choice in dessert either though the Tiramisu was generally fine.

Wanna take your taste buds out for a treat ? Wanna try out something different from the regular Indian and Chinese dishes ? Been missing sea food in Kolkata ? If your answer is YES which I am sure it is , look no further and get yourself parked at OCEAN GRILLE !We visited Ocean Grille today with approximately 20 heads and we were more than surprised by the unique cuisine served there , with¬†mind blowing taste, fantastic service and above all wonderful behaviour of the staff and yes at an unbelievable wallet friendly price.¬†It would be injustice not to mention about the Chef / Owners - Shane Chatterjee and his wife Sumana who are actually cooking up a stormWhile the prawns are fighting with the fish and crabs inside my stomach my ever foody mind is planning its next visit to OG !!!So next time you guys are planning a meal out make sure to drop by at Ocean Grille from 10th of December ( They are undergoing renovation till then)...and just incase if you get lost turn on¬†your GPS ..its bang opposite to BBQ Nation and RDB Boulevard - Sector V Salt Lake.

It was a big disappointment. Its quite pricey but the food quality is sub-standard. The starters tasted so bad that most of us did not have the courage to taste too much of the main course. The chicken was too sour, the lamb pie was ¬†too dry and the mutton wasn't cooked decently. Its only saving grace was the caramel custard which was prett great. All in all, a very bad experience and would not recommend this place to anyone.

This is the Place where people go, when they don't have time to wait for seat in Bar BQ Nation. Price is same as of Bar BQ Nation but the Food Taste Horrible. The difference between Bar BQ Nation and Ocean Grill is same as of 1st Class Rajdhani and general class in Indian Railways. We went out there for Lunch after Bar BQ Nation staff told us that they don't have seat for next 1 hr. Ocean Grill is just opposite of Bar BQ Nation. So we thought lets try it out instead of waiting as we don't have that much time. They have every things Perfect except Food.

Situated extreme opposite of barbeque nation. Went there on my last bday..I was really impressed by the interior of ocean grill. Surprisingly they bought a pastry for me which was really tasty.  The starters were tasty and there was variations.  However I was not satisfied with their main course.the mutton curry was not decently cooked. But they cook the crabs in a very decent manner. I really liked their dessert platter. Overall a nice expericene on my special day except the mutton.

As you enter the restaurant, it presents itself with an amazing vibe. The interior contained impressive decor with an oriental touch. However all the excitement comes down considerably when you see the menu. It lacked variety; certainly not upto the mark. The hospitality and the reception was outstanding though. We were proactively kept updated about the preparation status of our order: one thing that I really made me go all praises. The food again was a bit less sumptous than expected. We were really unsatisfied with the mutton roganjosh. However I have a positive attitude towards the place and would really like to revisit it for a different cuisine. As they say, its the chef's mood thats served to you. Looking forward to increasing the rating next time.

Ocean Grill is among the top bunch of restaurants we visit for team lunch from office. I really can't count the number of visits in last 1 year. Ambience is good with lots of space. They can accommodate as big as 20 odd people in a single table with little bit reshuffling in seating arrangement. 
We always opted for buffet. Starters having a wide range from veg items, chicken, mutton, sea foods, prawn etc. It used to have a wide range of salads to choose from, but nowadays only 2/3 varieties are there. In main course again you will be having chicken, sea fish, prawn, mutton preparations. One can try crab also, if present in day's menu. I believe the restaurant is really lagging for dessert options - only a selected few item - no ice cream.
On a overall note, a good restaurant to be in when either company or client is paying the bills. I would not opt for Ocean Grill, if I need to pay from my own.

Ocean Grill, the name sounds so fresh and tempting that I had to visit to this place and had been planning to go there for the past three days... And honestly the visit is one such memorable time... Located in Salt lake sector V, it really was a calm and peaceful restaurant... Well, really??
Oh ya! Start with entry, the staffs are super confuse and they are more interested in watching the football match instead of attending the customers...
Okay, let's try to ignore this fact, after all they are also human.
Now sit and here comes the food... Food? Goodness Gracious, just two piece of chicken kebab is carried by a thin waiter, just 2 piece... Alright ignore the fact... He is the waiter, may be he is asked to do say... Well mind you, my fiance and I went for buffet. Chew the kebab, and the outcome of it is the same as a sugarcane stick looks just after the juice is extracted. Hard, stale, smelly. We complaint. Kebabs kept getting harder, and I kept getting hotter... Next comes the soup, my God, it wasn't a soup but water. I think it was a left over soup which they served with additional water. Yuck. So late service, with such bad food, with completely television obsessed waiters... Couldn't bear much... I called the manager and complained... I wanted to leave and here comes their reply... OK!!!

Guys, please don't sacrifice your Money, time, and the love for food to this particular restaurant. I rate it one coz they didn't ask money for that pathetic stone, or I would say kebab, or whatever...
Thank you.

Ocean grill is the one place to satisfy your appetite fully. The restaurant has so much to offer that you will simply be pleased and happy too. With delicious food and cozy ambience the place has something extra to offer always. Come to the restaurant situated at Block GP, Sector 5, Salt Lake. On weekends to enjoy the food there with family was an overwhelming experience. A platter of Dal, mixed fried rice was first to start with. With rice everything mixed in it was tasted into mouth. As I love soup, Sweet corn soup was on the preferred dish. After that I ordered chicken tikka butter masala, lamb steak and chilli paneer. It was simply fabulous with rice. As I love sea food, I had grilled lobster and tandoori pomfret which was tempting. The soothing fleshy lobster and pomfret was melting into mouth smoothly.¬† Everything went very well with fried rice. In desert I had brownie with ice cream.

We went for an office party in a group of 35 for lunch. We pre booked our lunch and ¬†table was reserved for us. The ambiance is sohisticated and perfect. The starters were fantastic, very delicious and filling. Starters are unlimited as well with a welcome drink. The serving staff were very friendly and pleasing. Starters included a grilled fish item, grilled chicken item, prawn , paneer and 2 more veg items.Starters were filling enough and tasty. The mains included a wide variety and there was a fish cooked in white sauce which was most appealing. Desserts are the highlight of this restaurant. We ate tiramisu, caramel pudding, some cakes and fresh gulam jamuns and they serve icecream as well but you have to ask for. Overall experience was good value for money and we were satisfied. We will visit again for our next party. Bar beque nation has been our usual joint but now we needed a change in the food and BBq nation is too clustered and noisy.

They missed the secret ingredient in the pron.  Mutton felt rotten. Other items were not bad.

Desserts were nice.. 

Over all veg items were all nice.  Good place for people who want a veg buffet..

Dissapointment!!!!!!

Went to the Restaurant for a office Lunch Party..Even though got some negative feedback for this Restaurant but wanted to give a try.Buffet Lunch started around 12.30pm. 
Starters: Below average. They tried to serve some varities but not up to the mark.Paneer fry was not good.Only the sea food starter was good.Chkn not cooked properly.
Disaster: HAIR¬† in the piece of PIZZA they served in the starter.. Awful.

Main Course: Wel in the main course its better than the starters.Crab and Prawn was good.Chkn do pyaza was pathetic.

Dessert:Nothing better..Gulab Jamun was not cooked properly.

Pros:Place is in Salt lake sec V.
Ala Carte might be better.

Cons: So many.Management was not good.
Plates were not there.
Some gets served someone not.
Food was not Good.
NOT recommending to anyone.

Suggestions: Restaurant is Opposite to Bar-B-Que Nation.Where in 700 Rupees u can get the best Meal .But compared to that 750 Rs per head in Ocean Grill is just not value for Money.

We had a office party and decided to check into this restro for dinner (around 3-4 months ago). We were a group of around 20 ppl and had made reservations for buffet a day before our dinner. We arrived around 7.30 pm to find the restaurant scarcely populated. The ambience was pretty nice and the staff seemed friendly. We were seated at out table and starters were served. The quality of food was just horrible. Most of the dishes were either tasteless or weird to eat and there was one grilled saucy prawn dish which was simply uneatable. After that we moved on to main course. The dishes all looked pretty but the taste was not upto the mark. I only liked the crabs in the main course. The desserts were however better than the first two courses and the only thing one could eat to their heart's content. I wont suggest this restro to anyone especially for office parties, cause at the end of the day you would just get embarrassed in front of some out-of-city guests.

Since I am a vegetarian, my review is mainly based on veg cuisines.

In buffet, they serve 3 veg(baby corn, paneer and mushroom) and 4 non-veg starters on the table. Main course includes spaghetti, steam rice, green peas pulao, chilly garlic noodles, dal fry, mix veg, crab, chicken, fish etc.

Dessert was awesome with a pudding, a cake, 2 custards and yummy gulab jamun.

Only Soft drinks are available as complimentary drink.

Taste was really good. Usually, not many veg dishes are found in most of the restaurants but Ocean Grill is an exception.

And the best part was the service. At the end of my dinner, I told the manager that ice cream should be included in the dessert section. He told me that they do serve ice creams but they don't always keep it there and then he insisted us to have ice-cream. We were already done with the bill but since he insisted us so much, we had to take the seats again for having ice cream.

I liked the ambience, food, service and I would definitely suggest my friends to have the experience at Ocean Grill.

Finally a restaurant serving grilled food...the restaurant have been recently taken over by a masterchef from Melbourne and he is doing a good job..
I finally went for dinner on Friday night.. the chef being around helped us to choose the dish which suited our palette..
The buffet spread is huge consisting of 2 kinds of soup , 4 veg starters and 4 non veg starters.. its an absolute delight for meat lovers as the main course consists of fish, prawns, chicken and mutton.. a huge spread in the vegetarian section too, since i am not at all a veg person i concentrated on the non veg part..and all this for a mere 800 bucks..
we went the ala carte way ,started with chicken thai soup which had the right flavour not to tangy or hot neither too sweet.. .and garlic bread freahly baked in house to start of with...
coming to grilled food section, their crabs are to die for.. it serves one of the best sea food in town with an aussie touch.. we ordered for chilli crabs in korean sauce which was out of the world and the portion was enough for 2 people..and as a typical bong i loved the generous portion of mashed potato served with it...next we tried grilled bhekti in lemon butter sauce which was beautifully presented and tasted just perfect..since we are meat lovers we could not say no to lamb in redwine jus ..which was grilled to perfection with the right flavours which was similar to what we had in australia.. and a unique stuffed chicken which no other restaurant in kolkata serves..
we were so full by the end of our meaty affair so we had little space for dessert..but as a true bong cant miss the sweet dish.. so we tried the mango soufle , gulab jamuns as many have mentioned were soft and automatically u cant stop at one..and freshly made tiramisu ..which just tasted perfect as i am very particular abt my tiramisu..
so all u meat lovers and sea food lovers and non meaty people please leave behind your grievance and enjoy some good food as the whole management and set up has changed..so what r u waiting for just dig in..!!!

i have been there twice - once before the management changed and second time in yesterday (17th oct'14) and i didn't find much difference in quality of food. the location is just opposite to BBQ nation, on the 1st floor. the interior and decor is classy. light is bright and the place is spacious.
coming to food, the buffet is 600 plus tax. corporate discount is 10% before tax. they serve starters, 4/5 non-veg items including fish, seafood and chicken. they tasted nice, but they serve in low quantity and won't repeat unless you specifically ask for. also, we had to wait more than 15mins till they started the starter, even if there was no crowd and the restaurant was almost empty!
coming to main course, the spread is nice with assorted veg dishes for veggies and non-veg dishes comprised of chicken, fish, mutton, prawn and crab! chicken red thai curry tasted nice but quite spicy. loved the praw n preparation and the mutton. these are accompanied with fried rice, normal rice and naan served in table. the dessert side had couple of mousse, cakes and gulab jamun which were are decent, nothing to complain about.
overall, food experience is good. interior is very good. service has scope for improvement. but, i will definitely visit again someday later.

I was there for a team lunch yesterday (9-Oct-2014). It was pretty average..hmm...on the bad side.

Most starter items were average. Few of us liked the fish fry (Basa, I did not like it because of too much oily). Main course items again were average (compared to what we get at similar others). Mutton and chicken items both were of poor quality (and not fresh ingredients). I am a fish lover, but did not have the fish curry because it looked like I have cooked it. Two among others who dared found their pieces rotten. Did not try crab, because of small size with shells. Gulab jamun and truffle were good, pudding too sweet. 

Somebody asked for more fish fry during starter served on table, but had to remind the waiter later.

¬† The 2 points are for - 1> we were the only group, so no other noises (something rare in Sector V) 2> We came here after we didn't find a place in another.

Well, the food was pretty ordinary(Bengali cuisine served on that day). In my recent visit, during durga puja they were serving bengali dishes which tasted quite ordinary except some starters. Variety of the dishes could have been much better. For me it was not value for money. Oh Calcutta is much much better in terms of bengali Cuisine. Anyways what i liked most is the restro's ambience and staff's behavior.

Food,,,,variety is nothing of someting special, i'll  say the naming is kind of a mismatch to the platter served,,,2/3 types of fish/crab nd prawn. Totally predictable.
Service,,,, thats something we felt like very genuine, I tried the outlet with 3 of my friends(hungry wolves) and they filled our plates constantly with food and sheer amusement.
I'll say must try for people who enjoys quantity and quality.

Went to this place recently for the sheer purpose to last my hands on some "exotic sea food", however the spread was exotic but the sea food wasn't.
The normal spread you would expect at any buffet in town, I'd you expext loads of Crabs n prawns then sorry to say you might not be pleased. Starters feature a dish of Fish and Prawn each, while Crab only features in the main course, but wait... Its not de-shelled... Disappointing.
Further the Main Course spread was mostly North Indian and NOT AT ALL GREAT. Yes it was so mediocre that i prefereed sticking to Dal and Steamed Rice... Yes i know its not what one eats at a restaurant but i dint have much choice.
However starters were GREAT... Not just great, but Just Too Great...
So pls consider the lack of good main course spread before planning as the pricing is steeper compared to its neighbour (bang opposite) but the food isint...

I would not recommend this restaurant bcos of the fact they have acute staff shortage for which serving time of the starters r too much..spcly when u r hungry. We went there for a change from our usual buffet venue bar b q nations..but highly disappointed by the service. We were attracted by the crab in menu but the quality of crab was not to what we expected. ( compared to crab I had once in bar-b-q nations which was great as meat quantity was fairly good)..desserts were just ok with gulab jamuns being firm in consistency.. N ice cream was served in firni dishes.. ????. Any day I would prefer bar b que nations than ocean grill ..n even the price was more (1530 for buffet lunch for 2 people)..

One of a kind experience because of the excellent service they provide. Seemed as if eating in a relative's house where they push you to have more. The staff showed very high level of hospitality which is quite rare. 

The food though is nice, but not as good as some of the best restaurants in the city. I didn't like the prawn they served or the crab in their buffet.  The chicken in the starter was pretty good.

Amazing taste, great ambience!!! Few must have dishes are Lobster Thermidore, Grilled Bekti, Seafood platter. Staff seemed a little inexperienced and few dishes took more time than we expected, but everything taken into account, I loved it. Would like to visit more!!!

With the launch of the new iPhone my sister and me decided to celebrate..as Bar-B-Que Nations was full so we decided to try this new place..

There were five snacks for the non veg buffet-fish cake, spring roll, baby corn and potato, chicken, paneer tikka and lamb..all the snacks were good except the lamb and paneer tikka which were average..

For the main course we had many choices..we chose chicken tikka which had too much black pepper in it..fish in white sauce which was very good..spaghetti was tasty..herb rice was good..Hakka noddles were not too good..mixed rice which was again average and had too much of black pepper in it..we didn't try the crab, lamb and prawns..

For deserts there were 4 cakes-black current, chocolate, pineapple and cheese custard cake and gulab jamun... All the deserts were good but the chocolate cake and the gulab jamun were excellent..

Cold drinks were given for welcome..it was just a small glass which was too little..

Overall the place was good for a first time visit..

Writing this on behalf of my team leader Manas Ghosh ...He is an Asst. Manager in Wipro Kolkata and took his team for lunch to Ocean Grill on 1st Sept 2014...Before going there¬† the Manager of the Restaurant Abraham boasted about the food(normal market policy I guess) and compared it to that of Barbeque Nation.....Neway....There were only 3 RELUCTANT service people on the entire floor.....The starters never got started....When asked for dips along with the starters....we were startled to be denied!!!.......Now about the food.....the welcome drink was served in tequila shot sized glass and contained bottled soft drinks....I wonder why/Who named it Ocean Grill...when nothing¬† from the Ocean was grilled*****!!!!.........just some¬† paneer and some sweet water fish were served grilled/tandoor.....Mutton and Crab starters were completely missing......Almost all the items were Fried hence we kept looking for grilled.....The entire food spread was PATHETIC!!!!!.....Even the dessert didn't have an ice cream...All in all.....it is very difficult such a appalling standard of BUffet in entire Kolkata.....The WORST Team outing that we have had....THANK YOU OCEAN GRILL for the horrible experience!!!!!!

We decided to go to Ocean Grill for office party. We reached the restaurant situated just opposite RDB Boulevard at around 1PM. The ambiance inside was nice with light music played. They had nice decor and lighting was good. We decided to go for the buffet.

As we took our seat, the staff gave us good attention and mentioned that the starters would be served at the table. There was something which surprised me. Nowhere in the restaurant could we locate the list of items included in the buffet. On asking the staff, we were told that they did not display the menu since it keeps on changing!! Does this mean restaurants which display buffet menus do not change their menu items? Not a very good reason.

The starters included both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. Starters included Baby Corn,Veg Spring Roll, item of Paneer, Bush Cheers (an item of bread with topping), fish tikka, prawn and fried chicken. The taste of the starters were good but I especially like the fried chicken. There is also complimentary cold drink included. One thing I noticed is that after the first round of starters were served, the next set took considerable time to arrive. After two rounds we could no longer wait and decided to move on to main course.

Main course included:
1)Soup - Cream of Spinach Soup & Chicken lemon Coriander Soup
2)Choices of salads
3)Naan and Choices of Rice
4)Veg Hakka Noodles
5)Mixed Vegetables
6)Paneer Butter Masala
7)Prawn Thai Red Curry
8)Spinach Wrap Fish with Mornay Sauce
9)Chicken Tikka Masala
10)Mutton Rogan Josh
11)Veg Manchurian


We were really disappointed. Here is a restaurant which is ocean themed and it does not have crabs, no salmon, no other sea food except prawns!!! Then again, aren't prawns also served as a part of menu in almost all standard restaurant!! Beside, the taste of all the dishes was pretty standard. The biggest dislike for me were Chicken and Mutton curries. Both Chicken and Mutton were well cooked but the taste of both the curries was something which I absolutely did not like. These two dishes can definitely be improved a lot.

In desserts:
1)Fruit truffle
2)Strawberry Souffle
3)Caramel custard
4)Chocolate cake5)Gulab Jamun

The desserts were really really good. In fact, I have noticed that for most of the restaurants, the desserts section is really impressive  irrespective of how their other items tasted.

Here are some things which immediately need to be taken care of by the management.
1.The staff was attentive and all smiles and they tried their best to provide good service.But compared to the number of customer, the number of staff was less which resulted in slow service.
2. There was no option of fresh lime soda in the complimentary drinks. This is standard and should be included.
3. The menu may be changed but at least the sea food flavour should be provided on all days. Afterall this is a sea food themed restaurant. Also some sort of menu should be printed and displayed
4. And lastly, their spread should be increased. At the same cost, other restaurants provide double the number of items which Ocean Grill offers. With this number of items on offer, the price is too high.

Utterly irrational  management. Were interested in extracting buffet money for a 3 yr old child.  They lost out on 5 consumers of buffet. Regards
