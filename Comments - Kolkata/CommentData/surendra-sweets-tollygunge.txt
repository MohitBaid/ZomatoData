Surendra Sweets has become more of a brand than only a sweet shop in tollygunge area! Selling such delicious sweets along with its kachori(s) with alur torkari, the singara(s), the mixed sandwich and other evening snacks are more than tasty; But what separates these famous delicacies is their laddoo(s) !!! Simply speechless; I can guarantee these laddoos are capable of competing with the top sweet outlets in kolkata! Just loved it!!! Price of sweets are moderate along with their service ; Do give a visit for these yummy laddoos !!!

Well my grandma is quite regular when it comes to  buying sweets from surendra.So I decided to get some sweets from their.But I believe the staff at the counter needs to learn how to deal with customers. He was busy attending other customers before me.So with great pains I have had to give one star rating.I decided not to buy from here.

Packed some sweets from this shop. The shop is neat and clean and well maintained so it got my expectations high.
Packed traditional Bengali sweets-

• Joynagorer moya which was tasty. Though I feel they had mixed sugar with jaggery so was a little too sweet.
• Peda which was not good. It was hard and chewy and nothing like what a good peda should be like!

Prices are decent but overall was not happy with the items bought.
Not going to visit this outlet again.

Misti doi was good. 
It cost rs 18 for a small quantity misti doi. 
Varieties available. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
It's a medium spaced shop with no seating available.

An everyday sweet shop. One of the best sweet shops in the area, they serve pretty good quality of sweets as well as snacks. The rates aren't very high, and the sweets somehow manage to fit perfectly in the price range. Some things need to change, the sweets need to be of better quality, and they use food colours in excess. That makes the taste of the sweets a bit odd.

A big shop dedicated to sweets of various kinds.  Radhaballabi, kochuri and singara (not samosa!) are also available and they have chat section too. An one stop place to satisfy your hunger along with desert varieties on any given day. I absolutely love the Mishti Doi that this place serves.
