Visited this place today after a long time.. Ordered chicken biryani, mutton biryani and mutton tikiya curry.. The mutton piece they provided was way too small so they were asked to change the piece.. They did that. Courteous staffs. Yummy food..

Went there on a sunday so the place was completely empty therefore was served immediately. Ordered for biryani and rolls they didn't have mutton biryani available that day so had to be satisfied with the chicken. Biryani was light but did not live upto it's hype and the roll was very oily and not spiced enough had to eat 2 extra chillies with one roll. May go back just for the biryani.

Pocket friendly, yes, but the food I got was over cooked, flavor was off and meat was driest I ever had in one of these restaurants. Biryani was average too.. They should at least justify their restaurant-name.

This place was suggested by my sister‚Äôs friend, so the three of us went there for our lunch after a shopping spree at New Market. We ordered chicken kebabs, chicken biryani and a chicken gravy side-dish. The kebabs were served in an innovative fashion....on a vertical metal skewer!!

It was Dec,2016. After the 3hr of marketing..we 3 friends went to this place through the inner part of hogg market(very busy and crowded area).
It was approx 9:30pm..we were so hungry that we placed order tandoori roti, chicken bharta..Both items were so good..Bharta is a oily dish with crushed chicken pieces. Value of money..Not so highly recomanded..but good..Dont go for the ambience..Otherwise good..Happy foodingüçó‚ù§

So, after shopping for nearly two hours, my mother and myself were very hungry and found this on our way out of Hogg Market. Old Biriyani places have always been my favourite.¬†

The location is easy to spot.
The service is friendly, just like any other biriyani place. They make you feel like home.¬†
We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Reshmi Kebab and Mutton Haleem.
The quantity served is commendable. The biriyani was PERFECT ! The correct amount of spices and oil. The kebabs were juicy and tender, cooked to perfection.¬†
Being a BIG Haleem lover (the kind who would kill people for 365 days of Haleem supply), I loved it. Even parcelled a plate home.¬†
Allover, it was a wonderful experience.
The place is not at all fancy and you might have to wait to get a table.
Highly recommended if you have devil's hunger and are not expecting anything fancy but good Biriyani.

A simple restaurant at New Market area, which mainly serves North Indian & Mughlai dishes.

Tried Tandoori Roti & Chicken Butter Masala. Chicken item was average, oily and a bit heavy. 

Quantity was ample.

It is located near to Nizam's. Tried their chicken kashmiri, chicken kadhai with tandoori rotis ...both the chicken dishes were pretty average. Kashmiri came with 2 pcs of chicken while kadhai had 4 pcs. Chicken pieces were small. Kashmiri was the better of the two. Ambience is normal. Overall it was a mediocre experience...

Biriyani House, new market
Location: opposite nizam rolls
If u are a biriyani lover one must go to Biriyani House but it's a non AC restaurant with no ambiance. So once we entered the staffs took care of us. We ordered:
* 2 plates mutton biriyani- the quality and quantity of the biryani is really good. Tasted well and the mutton was soft and juicy. 
* 1 plate kadhai chicken- I didn't like it too much may be because of biryani
*1 firni- it was so yum I can't explain the taste. üòãüòã
* 1 plate green salad- serves 3 
* 2 cold drinks
   Worth of money and price is not high. Our bill was around Rs.720/-
Recommended!!  ‚ò∫‚ò∫

Chicken bharta, chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tandoori and tandoori rotis are some of the items I have had here. 
Chicken bharta: 3.5/5 quantity is decent. Taste is good but not extraordinary. 
Reshmi kababs: 4/5 tasted very nice. 6 pieces per plate. 
Tandoori chicken: 3/5 way too much spice. Didnt like it much. 
Rotis: good. 
The decor is absolutely plain. No AC seating. A reasonable restaurant.

This place is situated at the first floor at the back side of the Hogg market and serves Mughlai items. As the name suggest the main item on the list is biryani. I liked the chicken biryani and firni from thi splace. The place is little small and crowded during weekends, the price is reasonable. The place serves good quality rolls also.

Today i visited this place for my lunch. Biryani house offers pocket friendly food for the shoppers & office goers nearby. This is located opposite of UP bihar restaurant i.e. backside of hogg market near nizam's. This restaurant will be on your right upon entering the backside of hogg market.

The restaurant's ambience is similar to nizam's with adequate sitting arrangement. The restaurant was quite empty so it won't be an issue to get a seat. Anyways coming to the food,i wanted to go something safe so i had the following:-

1. Tandoori roti

2. Chicken bharta- Shredded chicken chunks with spicy masala,chillies & a half egg. The taste was good but what turned me off was the excess oil comtent of the dish. The quantity of floating oil was insane but i guess that's quite natural in mughlai dishes.

The service was okayish since there are only 2 people taking after the orders & serving the food. Also the prices have been hiked by Rs 5-25 each per item. So the menu listed in zomato is outdated. They dont charge any separate taxes & cost for one person would be around 150-250!!

It is located in the first floor of Hogg market. The place is not at all 'posh' if one goes by the definition of the term. The place is spacious. Went there yesterday along with my friends. We ordered egg biryani, mutton biryani and chicken biryani. We ordered chicken bharta as a side dish. Firstly, the hotel staff were out and out swift. Even while dealing with so many people and especially during the time of festivities they didn't take long to take our order or serve it. The Biryani tasted average. I was glad that they didnt compromise with their food quality even during the festive season. The Chicken Bharta tasted good but had excessive amount of oil in it. Now one thing they need to understand is that gravy doesn't equal to excessive oil. The dishes are a bit on the pricier side considering the place, but, the good thing is that, they don't take additional tax and one plate of biryani will well suffice for 2people with medium appetite.

Visiting Biryani House is like reliving the old memories . Used to frequent this place whenever we visited New Market . The place has remained the same throughput the years . There is nothing to talk about decor or ambience of this place , they still have got pedestal fans & that should be enough to imagine the decor of this joint . But they provide some great dishes . Today visited this place after a long time . The staffs have remained the same . I know a staff here who has been here for 36 years . It was really pleasing to see the known faces again . We ordered the following items :
Mutton Biryani : light & tasty , it tasted quite good . They have a big sized potato but do not provide egg in regular biryani . The mutton was rightly cooked & sufficient in size .
Tandoori Roti : As usual , nothing extraordinary but quite good .
Chicken Masala : Two pieces of chicken with gravy . The dish was mouthwatering .
Mutton Chap : Nicely cooked , oily but not excessively rich . With Roti it tasted great .
Firni : Served in a plastic container firni was very good .
Overall nice experience at a very reasonable cost . No point in expecting the ambience of fine dining places but if you like the old Calcutta eateries then Biryani House will not disappoint you .

Have been visiting the joint for ages now.Though i am shocked that the review was pending from my end.Reason being managed to visit the joint after ages.Had the laccha paratha and chicken chaap. The paratha was soft,flaky,piping hot ,melt in your mouth types.Yum!!!! The chicken chaap was not bad though i felt that i felt that richness of spices and the flavour as expected from the dish was sadly missing.As usual the dish was cooked in dalda and had loads of oil.Not for the faint-hearted.Service was prompt and not fussy.This is one of those fill your stomach and get out budget Mughlai joints that are present all over the city.Do drop in after a hectic shopping cum bargaining experience at Hogg market.

A place where I love visiting everytime I go for some casual shopping in esplanade. The chicken biryani here is a must have. Not a classic/legendary restaurant but if you want quality food in a cheaper rate, this is the place for you. The lachha parantha is also a must have in this place. Though the quality of the food is getting poor day by day and the staffs are getting even more lazy.

If you want to do experiment with new places, then you can try out this place.

A hot April afternoon in the year 2011. Two souls headed towards New Market area from the cemetery on Park Street, walking all the way. Exhausted and famished, one rejoices her losing 5 kilos of fat while the other dials a number to locate a restaurant that serves good biryani. Then they climb up the stairs and enter this place. The ambience was nothing great. No AC. A huge stand -fan was placed beside the other one and she is so calm that she does not require the services of a fan too often.¬†
The biryani served. The friends for life discuss they have tasted better biryani before. The quantity was good. The taste was just average though two huge chunks of chicken and mutton were served to them on a bed of rice in two separate dishes, of course. One quickly managed to devour an entire plate and some portions from that of the other; while the other struggled to complete her share of the food and despite being a follower of the anti-wastage policy, leaves her plate quite laden with khuska and some chicken. "An okay-okay place, not at all value for money" they concluded and embarked on the mission to hunt down a cab to get back home.

I had been to this place for a number of times. Located on the back entrance of the hogg market, it is not difficult to find this place. Looking for some ambiance, well there is nothing, but I don't know why this place is always a crowded place, I feel more crowded than Aminia, may be because of the space.

Ordered mutton biryani and mutton chaap. The mutton biryani taste was OK and so the mutton chaap. There are better options I agree to that but you can this once or twice.
====================================================
The review has been edited after a followup visit to this place on the 5th of Sep. 2015.

On arrival, there was no welcome drink given, it was around 7.30 p.m but the person taking the order mentioned that the ¬†Chicken Reshmi kebab are no longer available. Seriously?? Maybe too high demand. Mrg biryani priced somewhere around 135 with the quantity and the chicken piece I seriously failed to understand the price point, I would have agreed to pay this price or even more if the taste was one of the best in Kolkata. But sorry to say its no where near to that also. Gosht Dakbanglow, this dish made me speechless, I just had the curry with just one chunk of meat. The rest not even packed, simply asked the waiter to take it away, hard mutton pieces, this happens if you are using stale mutton or may be something else which I don't know, whatever it was it was simply pathetic.I even realized the navy blue tissue which were kept on the tables are even not washed properly.

My previous rating was 3, with this visit changing it to 2.5

Note: This review is solely on the visit to the restaurant personally and dine-in experience.

A classic place from the classic times. I was introduced to this place by my 68yr old uncle, saying this place has the best biriyani to offer. Well, frankly I have had better biriyani, but the Haleem here is top notch. My Ajmeri friend says that this not THE haleem per say, but it right up there in the list. Overall, medium priced place to 'eat and get lost'.

I have seen this place since childhood. Used to be a massive hit during the 90's. Especially with New Market bound people who would refresh themselves after a long day of shopping. Great Biryanis and Kormas available.
Although the quality has deteriorated in near future, still it continues to be a favorite for many people. Especially their Mutton Champ is too tasty.
Also they are one of the very few restaurants who has the Home Delivery options.

In a Nutshell: May not be the best, still above average..

This place is simply one of those average Biriyani joints like many other in the city..Located in the back portion of Hogg Market this place serves up just a decent enough Biriyani alongwith some other tasty,regular mughlai dishes..This place is economical enough and because lack of some better eateries nearby you will usually find this place pretty full specially during the lunch hours..the prices are economic to moderate and their service is pretty fast..I would just recommend this place for some quick take away if you are looking for some alternative to the usual taste of Aminia or Nizam..Sadly the quality of this place has gone down too and they lacks consistency in their preparations..Also the ambiance is nothing much to talk about,its usually quite stuffy and hot inside since the a.c. isn't working most of the time..also they have some exhaust issues as well..Overall some of their better dishes include Mutton Chaap, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Kadai..

Located near the Hogg Market, this place is not hard to find and has some reputation. So i visited this place along with 2 of my friends. It's not a huge place and located in a congested area. It's Non AC and nothing less than a furnace during summer. Zero decor and there are all types of people here, so no classy atmosphere if you're looking for one.

Coming to the food, we ordered two mutton Biriyani and Mutton Chap and then tandoori roti's. They served us quick enough and the Biriyani was not bad to be honest, something i was not expecting after seeing the condition of this place. The chap was also good, with loads of shredded pieces of mutton and went well with the Tandoori roti's. The quantity is okay for a normal person as far as Biriyani is concerned. Same for the chap as well but it's too oily. Like seriously oily. Tastes good but you can say it's unhealthy. 

Therefore, i won't say it's a must visit type of a place. Okaish for people who are strapped of cash and wants some solid food. Otherwise just don't go.

Located in the New Market, Biryani House in my opinion the best Biryani outlet in Dharmatala area( certainly better than the Aminia's an Jeeshan's).
As the name itself suggests, you should and should only try biryani. Not so rich, tastes good. Firni is my favourite. Service and ambiance is no special. Cost-efficient. The space is not so big.¬†
If you explore dharmatala, you can certainly stop by this restaurant if you are a biryani-maniac.

I have been here multiple times, in fact every time we visit New Market, we make it a point to come here and it is only because of their delicious mutton rezala. Please try their mutton rezala with tandoori roti and you will definitely come back again, though the ambience isn't nothing to talk about. I have tried many a rezala in around Kolkata but I must say only this comes in comparison to that of Sabir's.

It was my first time today and I loved the food. The rolls were better than nizam's, I felt. The hospitality was customer friendly and the service fast, even during the rush hours.

I simply like the food.. Its awesome :)
I was not too sure whether the delivery food will be as per my expectation before ordering however when I had it.. Not only me but my colleagues also appreciated it.. Good going and hope to see this momentum growing higher. I will mark biryani xpress as one of the best biryani delivery at home and especially the new market shop as they were very kind and has a positive customer centricity. Keep it going and will always order from Biryani Express whenever there is a party at my place :)

Biryani House is NOT MEANT for BIRYANI. I mean, you would get way better biryani at Bihar or Nizaam right across the road. However, they make a pretty good kaathi kabab roll, and that is what you should be going for. The paratha here is fried well, but if you like it extra crisp, tell them and they will deliver. the space is dirty, so its a good idea to simply take the roll and leave.

Been there a couple of times.simple ambience,ordinary food in regular quantity and at reasonable price.chicken biryani and rolls are recommended.i had firni in my last visit but the quantity is very little compared to price.service gets a thumbs up.
Happy eating

visit this place if you are hungry in the middle of a shopping spree and want to have your food sitting at a table with a proper chair. the biriyani is cheaper than the other options available in the vicinity. the chicken roll is good. the firni  comes just after aminia's. the place is not somewhere you can hang out. and don't even try to go to the bathroom of this place. you won't be able to have your food after that.... at the end, try their mutton sheekh kabab

Those looking for good Mughlai food, including biryani, please stay away from this place. Food quality is very ordinary. A plate of biryani is full of rice with no boiled potato, and the mutton/chicken piece is small in size. Beverages (soft drinks) served are outdated! Service is bad and unprofessional.

the name is a misnomer,kindly do not enter expecting excellent biriyani..more than the biriyanis,you should try the rolls over here..lachcha paratha wrapping over succulent meat and eggs..and yes the firni is excellent.the kebabs are just fine,but the biriyani is quite oily.the ambience is not great,the staff is not very courteous,its a good place for a quick snack in the middle of a shopping spree.
