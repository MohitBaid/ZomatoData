This place is older than most of the apartments in this area! There's something cute and holidayey about the restaurant. It's a quick food getaway, and will provide you simple food when you're hungry.

Located on bypass this place looks impressive with unique sitting arrangement. Its an open aor restaurant but the food is ordinary. It's an ideal plave to sit and have some snacks in a breezy evening. I never had the opportunity to seat and eat in this place but had packed food from this outlet twice. Quantity  of food is good and prices are also cheap but the taste is ordinary.

Last night taken parcel. No words to describe how much pathetic the food was. I have to throw out most of the food as it is not appropriate for consumption. It is better to have mixed chowmein from roadside stall instead of taking it from here. Even the atmosphere of the place is not welcoming. Never visit again, neither recommend to anybody to do so.

i have always tried them at home, so can't say much about the ambiance and staff..but the food is pretty average, i have had better street food in Kolkata at a much lower price.....i just try them when i don't have any option....

The review was based mainly on there food.... want to give them 2.5 but giving them 3.5 because I have some sweet memories with this joint.... I am visiting this place when it was just opened with my friends.... at that time I have no idea about ambience, deco, service... only thing which was important to us wether the place was serving tasty and tummy full food or not.... from that time till date when even I visited this place wether alone, or with friends or for take away there food never disheartened me from the food point of view.... but I have have say the ambience of the place deteriorate significantly.... mainly the place is for lovers and loffers.... there sre some people are drinking with in the AC section although they don't serve drinks... I asked the waiter but he denied.... my suggestion will be to have there food by taking home delivery or take away or have a quick snacking.... although they developed there outside seating and deco considerably.... then also the environment was not good and mosquitoes will ate your blood more than what you consume as food from there both in AC section and outdoor seating.... today I have there 1. Half chicken tandoori.... good, 2. Lachha tandoori paratha.... very good, 3. Chicken kasha.... very tasty and taken home 1. Mixed chowmin... very good ( don't expect it like Mainland China, its Indian style delicacy) and 2. Chicken with veg.... very tasty.... staffs are courteous but have a little hankering towards trips.... service was ok... pocket pinch was little high considering all the above facts....

To give a treat to my cousins. We couldn't get a decent eating place nearby so we came to Hot Spot. Ordered a mix chowmien (prawns egg and chicken) tasted good.. Then chicken crispy which rather tasted sweet. ( I actually would have liked if it was more of a bit ).

Good place for hangout. Nice hospitality.
Food quantity was okay for a head. But, as per price food quality was very poor, specially Chilli Chicken, schezwan chicken. Chicken Chow was oily.

This has turned one of my favourite food joint recently. Its a walking from my place. The food tastes awesome. One must try Tanduri Chicken & Chicken Tikka Mashala with Tandoori roti. Their mutton items r good too. Service is good. If it invests to improve the ambiance, it would stand at much higher rating nd put other famous restaurent at envy.

Just 2 minutes walk from my place and I have fond memories with Hot Spot! Although I do not visit this place anymore coz of the not so good ambiance as the place has lost its charm! You wont find any sophisticated bunch here and so, I do not dare to go to this place nowadays. However, when it was first started, we all were much happy as it was the nearest food joint from my flat! We would order several things from the place and I remember that they would make awesome Paneer Pakoras and Chilli Chicken! It's been 2-3 years that I dint taste anything from Hot Spot. I just wish they improve their ambiance a bit more and make it comfortable to look at for the visitors like us. Wishing them success! 
3 out of 5 from me for the old memories, strictly!
