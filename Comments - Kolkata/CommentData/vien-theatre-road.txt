Been to this place many times, serves good quality snacks,and hygienic as well. There style of frying the puri is a bit different, and the puri sabji is a hot selling item along with there special sweets. The almost 6inch long langcha is a challenge to finish. Overall nice place to have some morning breakfast or evening snacks.

This sweet confectionary is situated near the Shakespeare Sarani Police Station.

Service is good.

Shop is clean.

Tried their Nolengur Sondesh & Singaara. Both were fresh and awesome with a reasonable price tag.

This shop is situated just beside the Shakespeare sarani police station. Boy o boy do they make some mean sweets! The nolen gur rosogolla is at 12 for small size and 18 for the big one. Oh pure bliss it is. Must try.

This is a must visit shop for every samosa and rasgulla lover out there! I have visited this shop innumerable times and have tried so many of their sweet items...But somehow nothing matches the taste of their rasgulla and rasmalai! They also serve nolen gurer rasgulla but that's a seasonal affair!
Their samosas are to die for! They have a comparatively thin outer covering compared to most other samosas and the potato filling is really tasty! A must visit for all :)

Went there for the rasgulla. They serve the nolen gur wala rasgulla during winters. They are tasty and decently priced. But an honest rasgulla will tell u that KC das and Chittaranjan tastes much better

This place is famous for its Rasogollas and Rasomalais. Yet this place serves fabulous Singharas (Samosas), for which it rarely gets any mention. The sweets are all really good. These people have existed in a prime location over the years, which speaks volumes of its quality. Should visit if you are looking for good quality, Bengali sweets.

For me this place makes one of the best rasgullas in town! Located in theater to add Shakespeare sarani, this old shop has been serving sweets for over 2decades now!
The rasgullas are my most favorite here. They make it soft, pillowy and spongy!
Other favorites here include samosas and the rasmalai!
They make a wonderful array of channa sweets and there is no compromise in quality!
The products are top class!

Do stop by for a rasgullas explosion when in the area!

Apparently looks like a run of the mill sweet shop, on bustling Theatre Road, the place named "Vien", bears a moderately high chance to get overlooked while passing by.
However, a walk in instead can afford you a chance to dig in to some delicious bite of sweets and snacks, the place offers.
In fact, people can make a meal for lunch, out of the offerings that they have in store. Price is absolutely pocket friendly, and the food is genuinely fresh and delicious in taste.
A very nice place to try out.

As all know kolkata is famous for rasogollas. Let me rectify it well kolkata' s famous for vien's rasogollas. It's the best sweet shop in kolkata to have rasogollas. The rasogollas are big in size, sweet and very soft and tender. Heavenly taste. I have tried many places before but vien's rasogollas are above expectation. I would surely recommend it to anyone who loves rasogollas.

Didn't expected this place to be on zomato but every time i get surprised, seen lot of reviews of here from the fellow foodies so decided to make a move here. Just 5 minutes walking distance from my office at the Shakespeare Sarani. They make some very good and tasty sweets here. They have got variety as well as quality in their sweets and other stuffs. Not a very big place but a standard sized sweet shop which stays very quite but speaks with their fabulous sweets.
Just tried few from here in the hot afternoon today. Tried their two sweets and singhara as well. Sweets justified the price and singhara was well made fresh and worth the money.
Quality and quantity is pretty good and satisfactory.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Sweet quality is good but behaviour is pathetic. Even if you take sweets of 50 rupees one has to shell out exactly fifty rupees. If you give 100 rupees note they will return it. One must carry exact change before going to this shop. Every day every customer faces this peculiar problem. Try to avoid visiting.

The best little Mishti shop in the Theatre Road/Camac Street area. Its been around for several decades and is a HOTTTT favorite with the nearby College girls and boys aswell as the office goers of the area aswell as the Society memsahibs. Great Singaras and mishtis all very mouth watering. the great thing about Bengali sweets is their¬† lightness and relative less sweetness as opposed to the "heavy" and extra sweet stuff of the North-particularily Rajasthan. (Probably one of the reasons for the lower incidence of Diabites here than in Rajasthan and UP). Because of their lightness you tend to indulge a little more without feeling 'Full". Try the Rosogullas the Bengali style--squeeze the juice out and pop the chenna balls --youll be surprised as to how many go down in quick time !!!certainly one of my favorites.

Location: A couple of minutes away from Kala Mandir; A stone's throw away from Shakespeare Sarani Police Station.

After a visit at their branch at Southern Avenue, I was informed about the former at Theatre road and, thus decided to drop by. I was by now, very well acquainted by their timings in regards to the availability of fresh sweets and hot savories and henceforth planned to visit it around the early evening hours.
This branch of Vien is pretty old and isn't as big as the newer one, but, it certainly dishes up the same quality of sweets and savories. CALLED for their Rosogullas and Singhara. The Rosogollas were hot and melt-in-the-mouth type, and, the Singhara with the flavorful filling was served piping hot and wasn't oily. They also have Kachoris during lunch hours (comments due). 
The STAFF was polite and friendly. The SERVICE was quick as well.
PRICES wouldn't be a pinch at all.

Overall a great experience and a place to look out for their fare and not the ambiance.

This place has been our winter haunt since we were kids.  The only two things we have visited Vien for are their gur sandesh and their gur rassogollas
 Both these items have never disappointed us.

The items are decently priced as well.

When i first ate rasgulla in kolkata i realised why most of bangali's are suffering from diabetes :).....however the finest rasgulla i had in kolkata was at vien. This is a very small and old shop. No fancy decorated sweets. However when you get a hot ,super soft gud-rasgulla .....yummmm. its heaven :) cant wait for my next visit.

What is not to like in Vien? Now that is a tough question. From their delicious luchi cholar daal, to delicious dahi, their sandesh, everything is too good. I visited this place many times. In fact whenever I am in the vicinity will definitely go to this place for pocket and tummy friendly food. You really have to hustle and bustle to reach the counter when its lunch time in nearby offices. The Kolkata food heritage is made of many ubiquitous food joints like this. Must eat Rasogolla here.

This rating is solely based on the rasgullas they serve which are just fantastically mind blowing. I was introduced to this place by my family fried and would be greatful to them for the same. Their rasgullas are soft and melts in your mouth. The price according to me is quite reasonable . I have also tasted their kachori sabzi and singhara but did not quite like it much as I personally like the kachori subzi to be slightly spicy and in this case it was not.. But since its a sweet shop it pretty much excels in all of the MISHTI items...

Vien has been a sweet shop that is a family favourite for over two decades. I can't remember get together at my parents house that did not feature the indian dessert component from Vien. Fresh well made soft Sandesh especially the Lemon Sandesh which is superb and the Conch Shell Shaped Shankh are both highly recommended by me. The Soan Papri and Rosagolla are also very good. If you have a sweet tooth I would certainly recommend you give this place a try.

One of the older and better known sweet shops in this region, Vien does not have the usual Bengali sweetmeat range one is usually accustomed to. One sees more of drier sweets. They do a decent mishti doi. What I have the most are the samosas and the darbesh. I feel the samosas used to be better spiced earlier, and over the last few years they have become a tad blander (I do not like overspiced samosas in any manner). They have increased in size and now retail for Rs 10 each. Their darbesh (kind of a laddu) are mouth-watering. Just go and try them!

Parking is an issue in this area. The shop is situated on Theatre Road, just west of the Loudon Street crossing.

I give it a 3.5 because of its sheer reputation that even found its way to my school Bengali book. I have had food here just once. I had two things. First was the hot samosa fresh from the frying pan and I loved it. No wonder it is famous. The second was rasgullas. warm rasgullas that seemed very nice to me. This is one of the heritage shops of the city and I suggest you try it at least once because I dont know about you but I for one am to some extent a brand person!
