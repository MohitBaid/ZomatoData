From the house of Grill comes another themed restaurant . With the theme of modern view , the interiors are designed in modern industrial tone with balance . The lights are dim, and mesmerizing The place is spacious and the seating area is ample.
 For the starters we ordered,¬†
I loved the grilled fish and varieties of chicken dishes . I was thrilled by such amazing food. The service was beyond expectation. Great Hospitality by the Staff named Siddharth was well behaved and very attentive as well as co-operative . Well behaved staff¬† and to the marked commitments made the dine in amazing.

The food is good but there are places offering a better buffet in the same price range. The staff is courteous and patient. They help you a lot to have a wonderful dining experience. 
P.S The quality of food has been going down w.r.t my earlier visits.

I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon with my partner. It was near about 3:30 pm and we were the last customers entering the restaurant. Starters were served within few minutes which included chicken kebab, chicken wings, mutton kebab,prawn,brocolli, mushroom and paneer. Chicken wings and mutton kebab were the ones which I liked the most. They had a huge variety of main course. To name a few there were keema biriyani, chicken, mutton, palak paneer, naan, fish, dum aloo and many more. One can die for that delicious keema biriyani, soft pieces of mutton which were cooked perfectly and the fish.( it was out of the world). We even took a cocktail and a mocktail as complementary drink. Then comes my most favourite part, Dessert. I am not going forget the desserts ever. Cheesecake, jalebi, malpua(It was kind of like that, I don't remember the exact name), custard and ice cream ( chocolate, vanilla, mango and tutty fruity). I wish there were more varieties of desserts though.
Overall,
Ambience- 4
Food- 3.5. ( I wish they had more variety and the starters could have been more delicious)
Service- 4.

We went on a buffet dinner here...this place is at the top floor of the mani square mall... The buffet menu is very good...but there should be more inclusion in the menu ..the number of starters must be increased....they offer something special which is a live chat parlour...their chat parlour is awesome and with a great taste...they have dessert of different types...overall this place is a good place for buffet dinner ...if they provide live band it will be prasie worthy...

Flame N Grill is one of the buffet restaurants of the Speciality chain, serving live grilled kebabs and a scrumptious buffet.
Visited it for lunch on Christmas. Decor is minimal and contemporary, and for the festive occasion was decked with tinsels, stars and a Christmas tree lit with fairy lights. Some of the extremely polite servers wore Santa hats. 
Service is swift and very efficient. Hospitality is praiseworthy. üëå
Our course started with the appetizers consisting of Peeli Mirch Ka Tandoori Murgh, Chermoula Grill Chicken, Nimbu Kalimirch Fish Tikka, Tandoori Spice Grill Prawn, Gosht Gilafi Seekh and Garlic Chicken Wrap from the non-veg menu. If requested they would also serve the veg appetizers.
The prawns, mutton kebabs, tandoori chicken all were delightfully tasty and of good quality, except the chicken wrap which was not upto the mark.
The main course consisted of the buffet that includes veg and non veg options. From the veg section I opted for Paneer Teen Mirch, Khumb Makai Do Pyaza, and from non-veg I took Kolkata Chicken Biryani, Murgh Makhani, Kadai Prawn, Currypatta Crab, and Mutton Curry Home Style. The crabs mostly had the shells rather than the meat; the paneer and prawns were exquisite, biryani was light and flavoursome, while the murgh could have been better. Fresh salads were also available. 
The desserts were awesome; the Mousse was fantastic, as were the Strawberry Cheesecake, Gulkand ki Phirni, Malpua, but the Angoori Gulab Jamuns were not that great. The gulab jamuns offered at Barbeque Nation are simply way better and possibly the best in the city.
A Christmas special live chaat counter had been arranged providing delectable dhokla, phuchka etc. Tried the Dahi Phuchka which were indredible, but the Dahi Vada failed to impress. 
My experience led me to conclude that most items at Flame N Grill are of excellent quality and taste, excluding a few offerings. The starters at Flame N Grill are of slightly better taste than Barbeque Nation, but as far as main course and desserts are concerned Barbeque Nation is the winner among the two. Nevertheless Flame N Grill is truly a wonderful buffet place to indulge in some really good food, and eat as much as one wants. :)

A steadily growing restaurant, flame and grill offers something exotic. It buffet menu is what is to be tried at least once if ever you visit the place. 
In my case I tried the non vegetarian menu and was actually very very impressed. I always preferred Barbeque nation‚Äôs over all other sorts of buffet but this place has that special something, something that has the capability to snatch away the charm and offer tough competition in the city.!

Try this place if you want a nice buffet experience and you are bored of the same Barbeque Nation's menu. As you usual you start of with a complimentary drink.

Starters include:
1) Chicken kebabs - Gr8 nice and moist
2) Chicken Wings - Not too spicy with sauce 
3) Chicken Lollipop/Drumsticks - Cooked to tender meat
4) Mutton shammi kebab - Little bit on the drier side
5) Prawn kebab - Nice and juicy
6) Aloo tikki - As usual
7) Paneer kebab - Paneer could have been softer
8) A special for the day starter (varies day to day)

Moving to main course:
1) Chicken rice
2) Fish kolapuri - Best of the lot in non vegetarian 
3) Chicken butter masala
4) Indian breads
5) Veg Kofta - Best of the lot in vegetarian 
6) Lentils
7) 4 - 6 variations in salads
8) Soups (Veg and Chicken)

Lastly deserts weren't overwhelming. It included:
1) 2 types of pastries - pineapple and vanilla
2) Gulab Jamun - Nice, small sized and adequately warm
3) Firni
4) Halwa
5) 4 types of ice cream with chocolate sauce (Pan, vanilla, butterscotch and chocolate)

I may have missed 1 or 2 items from the above list but you will get the idea of it. If possible book a table before hand as the rush may get real (they won't book one on weekends though..)!!

We had a team dinner on 20th December.They had lots of dishes in maincourse section comparing to Sigree and BBQ nation.We had a warm discussion with their staffs due to non spicy starters.After that their manager comes into action and made a delicious chili prawn only for our team.As we had a warm conversation, now to manage that they shown their hospitality which really commendable.

I wish I could have give 5 stars.Due to less number of western desert I cant give that .5 rating.Definately recommend other to choose Flame & Grill over other bbq or grill resturent.

I would have rated a 4.0, but Flame and Grill got a 0.5 extra because of their service.
This pujo didn't work out in favour of Barbeque Nations or Sigree because they flatly refused to provide more that 2hours time to sit back, relax and enjoy the buffet.
Flame and Grill did. And surprisingly beautifully. I was a bit no-no for this initially, since in their menu, mostly as reviews suggested, they did not keep a variety of kebabs on the grill.
However, pujo means a much needed laid back relaxed time with no rush hush from the counter.
The food was perfectly fine.
Keema paratha needs a special mention. And mutton boti kebab. They even served us mayo (not chargeable) when I specially asked for it.

As does the fact that they had Anda Curry for main course, other than the obvious chicken mutton etc. I love eggs and even if it be oh-so-common and who-likes-egg-curry-for-menu, it is a pleasure for me to have it served. Mutton was extremely soft and lucious, rarity for me mostly in these buffet places. Also they had Daal Makhani. Thumbs up on that too. üëçüèª

As for desserts, malpoa and ice cream won my heart. As did the mousse.

Just one suggestion perhaps, you could do with keeping a round of complimentary drink.

A warm staff and neat decor!

Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I love the way they do the prawns. Lip smacking good. 
The mutton kebab was good. The chicken and fish was average. Nothing exceptional. 
Main course consists of common dishes served at buffets.
The desserts were really worth mentioning. Cheese cake melted in the mouth. Their strawberry mousse is a must try. 
Courteous staff. Friendly ambiance. 
Overall, good experience. Will definitely visit again.

Starter and dessert are the main attractions. The preparations of prawn and fish were palatable. Rabri with jelabi and cheesecake were scrumptious.

Another one of those places I'm glad to have ticked from my checklist. We opted for their dinner buffet.They a have a lavish spread ranging from a live chaat counter , starters comprising chicken,mutton, and prawn kebabs ( veg kebabs are available too),and a decent north Indian main course. They could improve the choices in the dessert section though,where the choices are somewhat less.
Ambience is great,and staff are polite.

This is one of the most commonly visited places by me when i go to mani square.. This time i had been there on a week day for lunch. The starters were awesome and cold drinks are served as complimentary drinks.. But this time i felt that there were not much chicken starters.. The mains were nice but i was so filled by the awesome fish and prawn starters that could not try most dishes.. But the naan and sarson da saag was awesome. So were the salads, relishes. Did not try any chkn or fish from the main section.. In the dessert the gulab jamun is a definite no.. no...... Too sweet.. The cheesecake ( mango) was not very tasty. But the warm gajar ka halwa and fruit custard were awesome. Dessert section needs more variety.. But one thing about the staff.. They were really polite and helpful.

Cost (for weekend lunch):around 950 per head.
But barbeque nation offers a better version of all these in a cheaper price. So choice is yours.

And they will keep on loading the grill in front of you if you don't get up and move on with your lunch. The main course is delicious as usual and the biryani is the best. Though I never got to try it nicely because my stomach was stuffed with the starters.¬†
There are a lot of options in desserts - from cheesecake to ice-cream to mousse.¬†

There were not so many items in the main course, but each and every item was delicious. And the dessert was good too. But the halwa and gulabjamun should be less sweet. Ambience is amazing, and the staffs were very friendly well behaved. Yes, we went for a birthday lunch and they served a complimentary cake. That was yumm yumm. Will love to be there again.

Writing this exclusively for buffet experience, which we had somedays ago in an office dinner. We were offered with starters that tasted quite good specially mutton Sikh kabab, chicken legs and the usual shrimps and fish. I actually kind of skipped the main course for this and moved on to deserts, though there were quite a no of dishes too chose. Deserts consisted 4 types of icecreams, cheese cake, moong dal halwa, gulab jamun, etc. They had a chaat counter too for gol gappas which I didn't had. Staff is attentive.

The starters wer to the point though they were similar to the ones in Barbeque Nation or Absolute Barbeque but the main course was really good. The deserts wer to the point and you get a lot of options to choose from. Overall a satisfied experience. Would recommend it for a family dinner as d ambience of d place is wonderful.

Flame and Grill, Mani Square is a joke. One of the most awfull experiences I have ever had in a Kolkata based restaurant especially given the fact that I was accompanied by my wife and my 3 year old daughter. I m sorry Mr. Anjan Chatterjee but some of the staffs you have deployed at the Mani Square branch are uncouth, ill-mannered and utterly dimwitted treating women and kids with unchivalrous disdain. In order to even get close to Barbeque Nation in the niche that Flame and Grill is operating in, you would need to improve your service by several magnitude. Once again, Mr. Mukherjee we are a huge fan of the Speciality Group Restaurants but the terrible experience that my family was drawn through is inexplicable. Anyone visiting with family, a word of caution for you. Beware of their staffs!! They will make every conceivable effort to ruin your dining experience. I got a call from Mr. Anjan Chatterjee himself including the manager of the restaurant and I m sure it was just one of those days when the staffs were in a bad mood. Nothing against them of course. Food was delicious as always. Its just that we thought we had the right to enjoy the delicacies that we were paying for. Still an ardent fan of your chain Sir.

It's my first time in Flame and grill and I can safely say that I'm impressed. It was a lonely Wednesday afternoon when we checked in. The staffs are very polite and well behaved. We got one glass of commentary soft drink. My suggestion please opt for fresh lime soda. 
In the non veg section there were mutton sish kebab, chicken wings, fish kebab, prawn kebab, chicken wrap in non veg section there were mushroom and broccoli . Sish kebab and chicken wings were outstanding. Other items were also finger licking. 
Coming to the main course, which is quite wide spread. Mutton biryani was best in the lot. 
There were four types of icecreams in the dessert section. Vanilla, chocolate, tooty fruity and mango along with different types of toppings and syrups. There were 2 types of mousse , hot gulab jamun, watermelon slices.
Overall very pleasant experience.

We went here on a sunday for lunch. The place was houseful. The staff was very courteous. We had buffet, they started with live barbecue which was awesome. We just had all the non veg items, chicken seekh kebabs, mutton seekh kebabs, grilled fish, grilled chicken, grilled prawns, chicken wings, chicken wrap. They also had mushrooms, potatoes and babycorn which we didn‚Äôt try. They served complimentary drinks for which we chose fresh lime soda and it was very refreshing. Next for main course we had pulao, rice, biriyani, dal makhani, butter nan, papad, chicken salad, murg masala, mutton rogan rosh, fish dopyaza and malai prawn, there were veg options as well but we didn‚Äôt try them. For desserts we had icecream, mousse, strawberry pastry, mango pastry, moong dal ka halwa, fresh fruits, gulab jamun and malpua. 
I loved chicken wings and moong dal ka halwa the most! 
A sunday worth remembering üòá

I visited this restaurant this year Durga Puja astami with sister and cousin. Ambience was quite good. It is there in Manisquare mall top floor. In Starter, we got some small fish fry, crispy corn, mutton kababas, chicken tikka, fish tikka, chicken prawn potato paneer sik kabab. Chicken tikka kabab was the best item in starter, chicken was so tender and juicy.
There has no complementary drink, we took fresh lime soda and which taste as normal good.
In main course, there was so many options starting from plain rice,polao, chicken Biriyani,different salads, soup,dal makhni, butter nun, vegetable jalpheraji,raita, paneer masala, mutton roganjosh, fish curry,mal prawn malaikari. In main course I love the malaikari though prawn size was small.
In desert section, we tried rosomalai, gulap jamun, pastries,papaya, watermelon, 4 different flavor ice cream with mango chocolate strawberry sauce and choco chips.
It was cost around 3.1k including three fresh lime soda.
Overall experience was quite good.
One thing, I would like to recommend to flame N grill, complementary drinks facility should be there.

one of the best buffet I had in kolkata.. non veg option for dinner is arround 850 bucks with corporate disscount . we had a team dinner last friday night.
with normal colddrinks they welcome us. the mani square outlet is having really upto the mark ambience as heard.. the staffs r polite n the tables r kept well neat.  starting with roohani fish kebabs then two types of chicken kebabs very much delicious.. next chicken tandoori and mutton tikka quite spicy.. next the best starter option that is prawn kebabs bang on taste. moving to veggie panner tikka n friend babycorn is very good. creamy broccoli grill also veey much delicious. live item is chicken pan taco may b it was really good. moving to maincourse the soup was good n customized. rice,daal makhni, mushroom masala in vegan I liked a lot.. in non veg fish was not good but mutton masala, chicken kasa, prawn palak n egg curry all r too good. coming to deserts rasamalai, moose both butterscotch n pieapple  to their other sweets. they have 4 types of icecream having  thats completes the quality dinner......
N.B: 
1.compared to their buffet price they need to provide a quality welcome drink 
2.make gulabjamoon less sweety n more tasty
3.staffs should b more attentive n organized during starters serving
4.as u r in kolkata make a quality proper fish item in main course
this things made me give u .0.5 marks less otherwise an awsm place for friends, family or team dinner.

Today me and my friends planned for a lunch date and to be honest had a great time and great food. The kebabs were truly outstanding and every item was equally perfect and delicious compared to the last item. Only the fish fry or the fish finger whatever you can call that was a bit out of a taste. Rest it was worth every second.

It was a meeting after ages so we planned for a grand dinner. As the preferences were for a buffet so without any confusion we chose our place. The dinner started at 7pm and we were there sharp by that time as our seats were not booked and we wanted to avoid the queue.
The ambiance was So nice and hygienic. As we sat they started with the starters in the barbecue. Hot and soft delicious Chicken kebabs and prawn kebabs. Later they served chicken lollipops, mutton sheekh kebab, fish fries and babycorn fries. As far as the starters were concerned every food were damn delicious and nicely cooked.
Moving on to the main course, so many varieties were available. Confused to start with what; but as I was almost full so I chose to have Chicken salad, Veggie salad, Mutton gravy and parotta. Very soft mutton pieces. The taste was super üëå. My friends tried Biryani as well paneer, prawn curry and so on. But they didn't complained of anything.
Next comes the desserts.
Happy to find hot and soft Gulab Jamun ü§ó
Chocolate icecream and yummy mousse.
Extra we ordered a bottle of mineral water and from mocktail we ordered King of Alphonso, which was a sweet perfect juice of mango.
Overall satisfied. Value for money and definitely superb service and very nice ambiance. Background music would have been little clear and a bit hit playlist üòé

It was three weeks back when me and my partner visited the place. We had to wait for sometime to get inside because if the lunchtime rush. We were showed our way in and the starters were served on the barbeque. The prawn was the best. Being a prawn lover there's anything more I could get into. The chicken and fish were equally good but I'm a bit partial with the prawn. The complimentary drink were great as usual. We were even given the mushroom and brocolli barbeque. The mushroom was soft but was little more pickled. The brocolli was average in taste. The coconut soup was average as well. The salads, polao, biryani, raita and prawn curry were tasty. We ended the feast with rasgulla, mango mousse, pudding and ice cream with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. 
It was an overall great experience.

Visited this place as part of a team dinner from office. It was my first visit to Flame & Grill. The first thing that I would mention is unprofessional attitude of the management. They did not turn on all the ACs till the restaurant was at full capacity, in spite of us requesting for the same repeatedly.

Coming to the food, the grilled prawn, fried fish and baby corn fritters were exceptionally good. There were many other options as well, but not quite to my liking. What I liked most about Flame & Grill was their main course. Generally, I have observed that main course aren't all that good at buffet spreads, but the dishes here were pretty good. Prawn malai curry, mutton curry and the biriyani were delicious. Dessert section was pretty diverse as well. I liked the Rasgulla payesh and chocolate mousse. My colleagues were pretty impressed by the moong halwa as well.

Flame & grill can certainly brush up on their starters. We visited this place on Panchami evening, so I don't know if it was the pujo rush, but starters certainly could have been better. And due to pujo the complimentary drink had been shelved,  hence am deducting a 0.5.

First visit to Flame Nd Grill. Well decorated,great ambience. Went for a lunch buffet Ashtami 2k17. It was the same style of serving the starters in hot grill as BBQ nation.

Starters including fish, chicken tandoori prawn etc. Quality nd taste both were really good.

Main course includes (veg)-raita, salads, steamed rice, polao, dum aloo Nd paneer. (Non-veg)-chicken Biryani, fish, mutton, prawn malai curry, chicken nd egg dishes.

Desserts includes mousse, rashmalai, pastries, gulab jamun, ice-cream (4 diff varieties) and fresh fruits.

But the disappointing part was that, they didn't give any complementary drinks and more starters were expected..

On saptami-2017, tried lunch buffet @flame & grill,mani square. Firstly,ambience & service were appreciable. Now coming to food review-
We tried lunch buffet along with fresh lime soda(this is not included in buffet)
Starters include crispy baby corn, fish,mushroom,chicken tandoori(most delicious part of buffet),chicken wrappers; chicken, prawn and paneer seekh kabab. Quality and taste, both were as good as one can expect. Starters also included some mutton recipes too, though didn't try.
Main course include raita,salads,steamed rice,polao,mixed veg,dum aloo,methi matar paneer,butter naan,chicken biriyani, and fish,mutton,chicken and egg side dishes.
Desserts include mousse,rasmalai,fruits,pastries(one of the best part of desserts), gulab jamoon and ice creams of 4 different flavours.
Taste,quality,ambience,service all were up to the mark; but still not giving 5 rating for two reasons - one is they don't give any complimentary drinks and secondly I think there should be more variety in starters.

The buffet though described as good by many isn't so comparing to buffet of Barbeque Nation. Moreover the price is also higher than them. Now you will find, if you have visited Barbeque Nation in the past, that, Flame and Grills' variety of barbeques are also limited compared to Barbeque Nation, though they taste good. The items on the main course table are also, less by 5,6 items. Staff courteousness  far better in Barbeque Nation and price lower. I have thus voted for overall experience. It was a bit disappoinent for me though. Visit both of them and decide for yourself.

And in the beginning we were not liking the taste of hariali Kaabab so they arranged some fish fry type of thing... But still it so not so good at this price and hence thier actually buffet price is 650/660 including taxes we got 803.5 per head that is 1607/-

The waiters there were very co-operative. The sitting area was very well designed and the choice of music was great. But the sitting arrangements can be made better. Now the food. We ordered for the buffet. The food was great but lacks in variety and the size of prawns were small. The main course was great . No complains. Starting from biriyani to chicken items. I loved it. And dessert üíù yummy. The mousse,the brownies, customizable ice creams, gulab jamun, everything were awesome. The dessert part is probably my favourite. And the cheesecakes were great.

But flame n grill restaurant tarnish my every myth. They served very good buffets with excellent hospitality. The live tandoor starters items are very tasty melts in mouth plus they have n numbers options as compared to other live counters. Their main course of course are good too. I love the taste of biriyani and egg curry. Dessert have four types of ice creams with chocolate sauce and different dipping. And mousess and many more. I would give 4.5 out of 5

 Somewhere the flavour n taste increases.. 
Flame and grill buffet will always be special for different kebabs. 
The buffet serves you with unlimited kebabs  and the dessert platter consists brownie, cheese cake, different sweets, cake and kajar ka halwa. 
Obviously the main course id highly recommended for heavy meal seekers...

Had been to FLAME N GRILL twice , with my parents on both occasions , had buffet both the times . The food , particularly the starters were awesome . I was spell bound at the variety of starters the restaurant offers in buffet . And to tell the truth we 3 were full after having the starters only. The main course was delicious as well and also had a large variety of item to chose from . The restaurant offers different menu for buffet on different days . And the cost for each buffet plate  ranges between 900/- to 999/- according to the food served that day .

Just like any other buffet restaurants, Flame and Grill also has its own pleasure. Fish starters and chicken wings were succulent and juicy with fantastic taste. There was a starter for potato coated with honey, as a result it tasted sweet. Probably a tad too sweet for my palette. A bit of honey mustard dressing would have made wonders withs sesame seeds around. What I liked was the variety in dessert. Two types of mousse, 2 kinds of sweets, other cakes and fruits along with ice cream. A lovely time spent and fun time eating. Recommended for buffet lovers !

Today I have visited this place with my team.. 
Let me put my review section wise:- 

Starters : Compared to BBQ it do have less number of starter options but what ever they will serve you will be completely satisfied. Best was chicken wrap and prawns. Prawn size are not too big but as i am bit allergic i liked that.. Fish,chicken kabab are also good. Mushroom can be better and they don't serve any chicken item on live gril.

Main Course: Though in any buffet restaurant its least interested section. But still we have tried to taste few of the items. Biriyani was too good and chicken items also. 

Desert:- What all i can say u will be satiesfied. They do serve rosogolla also... Hot gulab jamuns are extra soft. 

Service: I just loved their services.. They have repeatedly asked us whether we do have any problem any food.


Overall i liked the place ans will love to visit again and recommend to others...

I had been to this place long back . You will only get buffet here . Now they had increased the buffet price to aprox 1k. Previously it was around 650/- . Now coming to the food . For starter they have system of having to grill on your table . Their starter was really good . Specialty is fish kabab . Also various Chicken kabab was good in taste . They had almost 10 kind of non veg starters . They serve 1 complimentary drink . You can choose from soft drinks ,fresh lime soda ,beer , and cocktail . Their main course was not that good . Dessert was good but not outstanding . Overall good experience . Staff behavior was very polite .

Not upto the mark buffet according to the price. Services are more better in South City outlet. Buffet price is huge but the compromise is quantity. Prawn size is very small in Kebab.

As you go for a buffet you may think of being here. To Some extent it gives competition to barbeque nation. The only thing which is better here is the main course.  Tender mutton.. Chicken biriyani..  Egg kasha - you will surely like them if you are one of them who enjoys mid course after starters (as some prefer to jump into desert straight away like my hubby).  Well, it was his budday only when we visited there this Thursday. Anguri gulab jamun was So sweet that you can not have more than just 2pieces & there was No smell of ghee (Really was Missing barbeque nation here). And yeah finally, beware of the bottle of weather (in my photo) - it costs ‚Çπ 95..!!!

The name says it all. Great buffet with such a variety of dishes. The spread consisted of 11 starter items.. 10 main course items and 6 desert items.. With one time complimentary drink.. Each and every items were delicious.. Specially the chicken tandoori, curry patta fish tikka, chicken malai wrap, mutton biriyani, chicken lababdar and the desert items except bread pudding.. Dahi methi maachli was not upto  the mark... Service and ambience was A1.. Staffs were attentive and courteous.

Been here quite a few times and suddenly had a craving for the place again this August, so after movies headed for the place. It's a traditional all you can eat buffet set up and we had to wait some 20 mins to get a seat. While seated we were super hungry but again had to wait some 15 mins for attention. The starters are served on live grills on the table while main you have to help yourself. As usual they try and avoid give you the good starters so make a point that you force them to get you prawn and mutton kebabs and avoid the fish kebab totally. Having known that still we didn't get any mutton kebabs again which I even left at the end dinner feedback but seems nobody cared. Mains are just ok and some are really bad so recommend to fill yourself up on the starters (if they give you the good ones), try the biriyani ONLY in the main and then have some real sweet deserts which at times is too sweet for liking. Planning to skip this place for few years till I forget this dinner. Overall average but not value for money. My life and dinner partner :) Priyanka Sengupta liked the tangri kebabs so had to add that ..

I had visited the restaurant on 10th august with a friend of mine for lunch.It was a nice spread of starters A complimentary cold drink was served.They served us different kind of kababs on the live grill arranged on the table.Out of all of those Tabgri kabab and mutton sheekh  were my favourite.The spread of Main course is less than that of barbeque nation though i felt it tastes better.I really liked the biriyani and malai chicken from the main course.Finally coming to the dessert.It was really yummy.There is variety of mousse,cakes, fresh fruits,brownie and gulab jamun.Even the idea of choosing your own topping for ice cream is great.
I really enjoyed the meal. A special mention about the ambience and the attentive staff is indispensable.If you have not been here do pay a visit with family and friends.I bet you will have a great time.

The ultimate buffet spread for me. The ambience- fabulous. The staff-courteous. The food- heavenly. The starters included items of chicken, paneer, fish and prawns kebabs. It was a huge assortment. The welcome drink was an usual fresh lime soda. In the main course, mutton, chicken and fish items were okayish. The rice, veggies and salad were good. Now coming to the desserts- the vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice cream! I devoured them. Then there were pastries, cakes, hot gulab jamuns. The desserts were simply wow. I indulged my sweet tooth fully. I will definitely go for a second time.

It was my first visit to Flame & Grill. Well decorated, great ambience. Coming to the food, First they served us with MUGHLAI CHICKEN PARATHA, AJWAINI FISH TIKKA, PESHAWARI JHEENGA, TANDOORI CHICKEN & GOSHT ANDA SEEKH KEBAB in the starter section. They have the same style of serving the starters in a hot charcoal grill as in barbeque nation. Other than this as the monsoon festival was going on there they served us with two additional items- PAV BHAJI & PAANI PURI. That was really awesome.

As we were gradually indulging deep into the taste of the starter items all of a sudden they came up with our COMPLIMENTARY DRINKS.This I would suggest would have been better if served along with the first lot of starter items. As far as I know, BARBEQUE NATION does that.

Next coming to the Main Course, it was pretty ordinary. It comprised of VEG BIRIYANI, MATAR PANEER, STEAMED RICE, MUTTON KHICHURI, NAAN, KADAI CHICKEN, ROHU MACHHI MASALA & MURGH ANDA BHURJEE. There was nothing special about it.

Lastly coming to the DESERT section, it met my expectations. That's almost the same as you would get in a MAINLAND CHINA buffet. It was good. It comprised of ICE CREAM WITH CONDIMENTS, DOUBLE CHOCOLATE PASTRY, JELABI, WATER MELON, MOUSSE, ANGOORI GULAB JAMUN.

One thing which I thought I won't mention but now I feel like doing so is their service. I FOUND IT VERY DISAPPOINTING AS EVERY TIME WE FINISHED OUR STARTERS WE HAD TO WAIT FOR ATLEAST 10-15 MINUTES WITH EMPTY PLATES FOR THE NEXT LOT OF STARTERS TO ARRIVE. Now the question arises when you are charging such an exorbitant amount for your buffet menu, Should this be the quality of your service ?

Went for a family outing to this outlet of flame n grill but was utterly disappointed!! Being part of the "speciality restaurants group", they must pull up their socks so that the brand value doesnt get dilluted. Well coz if you have mainland china, sigree global grill n oh calcutta as partner brands...you must live upto the reputation.
The restaurant is located at mani square mall and the ambience is pretty good. Staff behaviou and courtesy is top notch as expected. The non veg buffet though was a disappointment. Starters were okeyish but not upto the standards of even sigree....leave aside the elite standards of bbq nation!! The best that we got was prawn kabab. Main course were equally dampening. Kadhai chicken dint taste even loosely like kadhai chicken that m fond of!! Deserts were nothing to talk about. My verdict is a very big thunbs down. If u dont get reservation at bbq nation or sigree global grill...dont consider flame n grill as n option....coz that will be a big mistake...like the one we did!!

Located in the top floor of Mani Square, this place is easily locatable. And you're most likely to get a table on weekdays without prior reservation. 

Starters mainly consist of barbeque menus. They gives a charcoal tray and skewers. They had Prawn, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka, mutton seekh kebab to offer as barbeque. Beside these, they had chicken bread and patiala fish nuggets in starters. Starters were really good though the quality of starters degraded with consecutive orders, I don't know whether that were intentionally or not. 

Main course were strictly ordinary to below average. I haven't tried the veg main courses though. So try to make the most out of the starters as much as you can. They had steamed rice, veg pulao, butter nun, mutton biriyani to offer as staples. Chicken salads, chana salads were there along with dhania chicken, fish item and two other chef special chicken item. Mango or papaya chutney with papad for your sweet tooth. As I said earlier, they failed to satisfy our taste buds. 

They had the dessert counter on the opposite of main course one. Offers chocolate pastries, vanilla & butterscotch mousse, hot gulab jamun, daal halwa, 4 flavours of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, truity fruity, yum aam) and 5 toppings to make them crave you more (choco chips, crushed nuts, jams and hot choco syrup). Mousses were very good but the gulab jamun could be softer. Overall I was very satisfied with their dessert. Offering Kulfi would be an improvement advice for them. 

Ambience was clean with a cozy decoration, instrumentals playing in the background. Very well behaved staffs and manager. Recommended.

Staff was very polite and prompt.. The food was great and it was not so much spicy which is the way i like it because being a Non Bengali it is pretty hard to find food without 'Jhaal' in the first place !!! Prawn which is my favourite was way better than Barbeque Nation ... I would have gone all the way to a five star but i guess i missed a complementary drink and sweet corn!!!

This was my first visit. And what a visit it was. The food was top notch. The quality was superb. The bbq chicken wings were the best of the starters. The sum biryani was well prepared, the mutton sheekh kebabs were succulent and well made. Added bonus were the chef special cake and the hot brownies. The assorted ice cream flavours although we're a few in number but still served the purpose. Overall the food quality really won my heart however a tad dearth of options made its presence felt at times. Will visit again. 

P.s. slight incorrect information in zomato listings. The all you can eat buffet for lunch was priced at 845 yesterday contrary to the 820 that zomato is showing.

This place is apt for non vegetarian.  The spread in the starter , main course and desert section is enormous for those who aren't restricted to a vegan diet . The Kababs were average . The broccoli kabab could have been much better . Enjoyed the potato variation and paneer starter . Desert spread was decent enough . Overall , if you are a vegetarian it is not a wise choice considering the amount paid and the food that is given in return .

The perfect buffet destination.
The lighting,music and seating arrangement was just perfect. Visited it this tuesday with 4 of my frnds. Ordinarily there dinner buffet is 950 but we got an offer of 'Eat 5 pay for 4' so our bill was only 3800 for 5 people.
Now coming to the food, they had 6 non veg starters namely chicken shikh kebab,prawn kebab,fish kebab,mutton kebab,chicken wings and a chicken bread kind of thing maybe a pie. The chicken wings was worst of the lot,overspiced. But the chicken and fish kebab was quite tasty and lip smacking. The chicken pie was chicken pieces stuffed inside a flour dough and baked. I really loved it. It was light on spices but quite delicious.
Now coming to the main course there was chicken biriyani,a chicken side dish, egg kali mirch,mutton keema masala and prawn dish. All of them was okay but nothing quite stood out.
Next the deserts. 1st  up there were 2 different mousse along with strawberry cake,cheesecake, brownie,hot langcha,4 flavors of ice cream and fruits
The cheesecake was the star of the show for me. It simply melted inside the mouth. Also the mousse was excellent and not too sweet.
The service was prompt and they cleared the table everytime we got up to get the food.
For me the main course was a downer otherwise a great place to visit.

We went there on holiday with a high expectation but we were not satisfied fully. There were veg and non veg kebabs. I loved the wrap, indonesian chicken, broccoli, mushroom kebabs. These were very good. The prawn kebab could have been better and the baby corn was tasteless. For the main course the biriyani was really good. I liked the mutton preparation. The paneer was soft and tasty.
 I liked all the items served in the desserts section but thought they could have increased  the no. Of items in this section.
The service was satisfactory.

We went here for the lunch buffet in a group of 16. To start with the ambience and the decor was optimum and soothing. Our starters had a variety of options from mushrooms to chicken wings to fish kebab and prawn fries mutton sekh kebabs and chicken wraps . But we were a bit disappointed with the taste nd flavour of few starters items especially the wings(taste was below par) and mutton sekh kebab(lacked the tenderness and succulence)..but the wraps, fish kebab & the praw fries were  instant hits. We expected a chicken kebab sort of items in starters so the absence was a bit dissapointing. Coming to the main course it had a large variety of items from veg to non veg. So its not problem if you are a veggie coz you'll get a lot of veg items. It started with raita ,salads(2 types), steamed rice ,veg pulao ,panner with white gravy , dum aloo, roasted ladie fingers curry, dal fry,naan,roti. Coming to non veg there was non veg salad(chicken), mutton biriyani, bhuna murg(personally it tasted the best),chefs special fish item ,kalimirch chicken . Dessert section was also good with moose (vanilla& strawberry), brownies with hot chocolate, fresh fruits (watermelon and ripe papaya), chefs special dessert & ice creams (vanilla , chocolate, banana, mango).they also give you a complementary drink(soft drink or lime soda ).staffs were very good and service was promt. We got a offer (eat for 5 and pay for 4) so the price was not that high comparing to other buffets . Overall it had good array of quality dishes with good ambience but the only downpoint being the tastes of few of the starters.

I went for the lunch Buffet in a weekday with my friends. It was a very nice experience, the ambience was perfect, people serving food were polite and humble. Coming to the food, everything was fantastic, the starters were super delicious, everything was cooked well, the shrimp was beyond everything.. Main course was huge, a lot of variety was there but everything had its perfect taste with perfect blend of aromas and spices. The biriyani was too good, even the basa fish preparation and kali mirch chicken was unique. The dessert section was a little dissapointment, the mousse was not at all tasty, it was excess creamy and the actual mousse taste and texture was not there. Still others were good, the ice creams were also great!

For those of you who have never been to a buffet, or F&G per se, if you haven't booked a table, you can still enjoy the buffet although, you might have to wait for 10-20 mins. It was my first visit to Flame & Grill, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed. Out of so many varieties in starters, main courses and desserts, I liked Chicken Hot Wings, Biryani, Dal Makhani, Chef's special Mutton Gravy (not sure about the exact name), ice cream, salads, and Payesh. What I didn't like were bland fish (ah, just horrible. No flavor), Seekh kabab (too dry), and barbequed prawns. Main course surprised me. The attendants were quite welcoming.

Over all I was really happy, only wishing to be able to eat more :)

P.S. There was nothing spicy/chilli in the buffet. I wonder why. It made me miss some hot flavors after eating so much variety of mild spices.

Although the concept of the kebab-and-biryani buffets and the unlimited spread has lost some of its novelty now, it still does draw in the crowd. The live tandoor set-up on each table, and guests grilling the kebabs ‚Äî kebabs are ‚Äòunlimited‚Äô ‚Äî kick-starts the meal here at Flame & Grill. The kebabs come with a variety of North Indian staples like Chicken Biryani, Dal Makhni, paneer and vegetable preparations. Non-vegetarians find their Chilli Mountain Prawns, Ajwaini Fish Tikka, Hariyali Chooza Kebab, Methi Jhinga, and Peppered Crabs quite to their taste. Vegetarians have good options too: Charmoula Barbecue Paneer, Tandoori Mushrooms, Achari Aloo or Pickled Half Grilled Potatoes, Veg Hara Bhara Kebab and Paneer Patiala. The buffet in Flame & Grill is open for both lunch and dinner, with quite attractive deals that please their patrons. A rather popular eatery that is located in two malls in the city, the menu at Flame & Grill changes daily.

This Flame and Grill is located at the 4th floor of the Mani Square mall.

After its renovation this was my first visit and they have just changed their decor and even their food became üòã.

Ya every tandoor item was great from 
HARE MIRCH KA AALO to their Paneer tikka even their broccoli marinated tastes great even their paneer quisidellas
Even their main course was good.
The desert had few sweets and great ice creams with different sauce and toppings.
U won't be disappointed having ur dinner or lunch here.
But what disappointed me was their mock tail

They had one üçπ ice litchi that was amazing but they had removed the good one out of their menu.

Others were good but not upto the mark in mock tail.

Went there for buffet with a friend. The starters were great especially the chicken and prawn. The veg starters were not so good. The main course was just average. But the desserts were pretty good. The service was great. The ambience and decor good.

We visited this restaurant after reading rave reviews on Zomato. Unfortunately we were not impressed, its just another place serving buffet. The starters are okay but lack the wow factor. Main course spread is also decent with a few standout preparations (palak chicken). Desserts were yum.

Allthough it was a decent meal, we somehow expected great things.

Located inside South City Mall. A perfect buffet place for food lovers. Needless to say that food was tasty and lip smacking. Well behaved service. Foodies, don't wait anymore. Just visit this place already!

Had visited this place all of a sudden... As i was too hungry and i expected it to fulfill my appetite .. and without any shade of doubt it did so... Had opted for its buffet menu.. loved the kebabs specially the chicken and fish ones.. starters in non veg were fairly good enough... But veg starters were disappointing for me... It was a complete waste... The mutton item was good but felt it could HV been better ... Then comes it main course... Couldn't hv much of it... But had pretty good options.. the biryani was good .. chicken item couldn't attract me much.. all were well cooked... Then it was turn for the deserts.. and i loved it.. i felt it to be the best part of all.. i loved the haluwa specially.. overall a good buffet experience but they could HV added some complimentary drink to it... Staff were friendly and courteous.. prompt in service.. non veg buffet was priced around 920 i don't remember the exact value... But 2000 for two will do for u out here with its amazing buffet...

We went there on a Saturday night..charged 950 per head for non veg buffet..umm...overpriced..
The starters were surprisingly good..i liked their mutton sheekh kebab which i normally never do..the chicken wrap was not good..the ajwaini fish tikka was okayish..the veg starters were showstealers..the mixed vegetables,the potatoes..everything was bang on..
The main course..the nuns were soft..the murgh malai curry was average..the chef's special mutton was average as well..kolkata chicken biriyani not upto the mark..main course average..
Desserts were bang on..the mousse was awesome..chocolate pastry was good indeed..the brownie was a wow..and who uses masala chai as a cheesecake flavour..that was a big turn down..the chef's special dessert was a halwa..it was yummy..the ice creams as usual..overall good..but Overpriced..

Starters are good. The service is very poor.I have never been to any modern restaurant where I had to ask for spoon  while I switched from starter to main course.The attendants were not at all professional.Please match with the service  as per the other restaurant whose name is starting with B and ending with N , having 2 outlets .... sec v and park street.The desserts specially the mousse was excellent.

Visited last night for a team dinner from office. Went for buffet. So it was okayish type. More sauces could be served with starters , we got only tommato sauce and pudina chutney . In main course the dishes taste normal compared to name given to them. Nothing special. Ambience was good. And so stuffs are,too..

You will find Flame and grill right at the fourth floor of Mani square. I went there along with my family. The servers are very courteous and the food is excellent. The starters had prawn, fish, chiken tandoori, mutton sheekh kabab. The main course according to me could have been better. The desserts again was excellent. 
You get a complimentary cold drink and they serve you with a complimentary cake if you are celebrating someone's birthday or anniversary.
To be frank, it gives Barbeque nation a tough challenge. I would surely recommend people to go for it!

It was my first visit in that place with my soulmate.. we had their buffet dinner...they serves lots of item in starter,main course nd dessert.. the starter includes chicken,mutton, prawn and fish...these are quite satisfactory... in their main course there were lots of option with lack of taste... I m really disappointed with those dishes... among those dishes jst only the biriyani and chief special veg were little bit good... other dishes should be improved...bt among all of food, I loved the dessert as I m a dessert lover.. bt each and every dessert item was too good and I ate plenty of them.. there were lots of option including cakes, gulab jamun,fruits,icecream in various flavour, halwa nd many more... bt one thing I must say that their price is little bit high in comparison with their food they served... lastly, once again I ll say that the  maincourse must be improved.

Visited it in January 2010 when my school friends and I chose this restaurant for our reunion. We opted for buffet dinner.....and I was busy taking in my first experience of the ‚Äòall one can eat starters‚Äô format. They were quite tasty, but then one of my classmates pointed out that the waiters brought only chicken, mutton and crab kebabs....no prawns or fish! He had been to scores of such restaurants abroad and was rather unimpressed with the variety of food on offer. The items in the main-course and the dessert section were standard fare.

One of the best buffet joints where your tummy gets filled up to its brim with the kebabs and so much so that I never could try the main course properly every time I visit this place. But the desserts sections are a must try, with those lovely flavoured scoops of ice creams!! The prawn, chickn, the basa kebabs are the best. A foodie-advice from my side would be, one should go for the different styles of kebabs and then directly to the desserts.üòú The ambience of the place is absolutely magnificent with appreciable staff services. üòçüòç

Buffet was not quite up to the mark with deficiency in the dessert section. The starter was okay with the elusive pineapple roast giving us a peek like a Hayley's comet. The main course was nothing special,  although buffets is not about main course at all. Overall an above average experience with the cost being quite high compared to what they had to offer.

Today I have visited here with my friends for the buffet lunch. But frankly speaking I was expected a lot from this place but totally I was disappointed . In the Prawn kebab there was no salt, Chicken kabab was with bone, all the fish items including Fish kabab is also made of ajwain and for that reason all the flavours became same about fish. In terms of main course, shrimp with spinach is a horrible disaster experiment from the mastermind . Mutton is too good and deserts are really mouth melting . But if we are talking about overall food experience I.e not up to the  mark at all. They should concern about their items. Lastly one more thing I have to clearly mention that the waiters are very much lazy to do their duty except 1 or 2. Every time we have to call them for any type of assistance not only that after calling of 5 or 6 times , then they were ready to come. Several times I have heard from them "Madam, I am really very sorry. I totally forgot". In this type of restaurant, I should not be listen  this type of sentence for the several times. So overall it's a bad experience for me. It's not at all worthy with their cost of buffet price because the price is pretty high . If you love kabab and wanna have kabab unlimited then I would suggest that definitely go for Barbeque Nation. There is no comparison with BBQ Nation.

This one is ny 2nd visit to Flame & Grill, but the outlet was new for me.. as the South City outlet is not working I had to opt for Mani Sq.
I went with my family for a friday lunch.. Its needless to say that they serve a good variety of Kebabs, but the point in question is the Taste. So, we had fish & prawns on the grill and chiken & mutton varients are served individually (I am attaching the menu so that you all get the exact names of each item).. for me the best item in starter was the Tandoori Chicken with whole spices (khada masala), it was tender with the flavors of each spice prominent in taste.. the mutton kebabs and the chicken wrap was good enough.. but I was not satisfied with the fish kebab, I felt that the flavors of the spices or curry leaves was not coming out, it was kind of blant to me.. also the prawns, I dnt know how many ppl will agree with me but I think the frozen prawn does not tastes good at all, 1. They are chewy and 2. They do not have any taste.. the fresh prawns where as can do more justice to the kebabs and other preparations than these frozen stuff..
Coming to the main course - I loved it.. I must confess that I had tried their vegan items as well as the non-veg items, as to taste & tell.. both veg & n.veg items were pretty good in taste.. Loved their mutton biryani, they were light & fluffy with full of flavors.. the chef's spl chicken balls and the fish sides were grt in taste (but to have with butter naan only).. in dessert the double chocolate pastry and the moong dal halwa were awesome, but the gulab jamun were not good at all, also I wished to see more pudding or custard sort of item in that section...
Overall nice experience..

Flame & Grill is bound to offer you a fabulous and flawless dining experience, especially their buffet is the undisputed champion, predominating over A La Carte.
The most impressive aspect peradventure has to be the vast array of mouth watering appetizers, viz the myriad kebabs, grills and other items of chicken, mutton, prawn, fish and what not! 
The entr√©e dishes are also praiseworthy, but the showstopper has to be their dessert.

All in all a lovely eatery, with an affordable buffet lunch, magnificent interior and location, topnotch service.

It is certainly one of the best places for those who love kebab. In fact, the kebabs in the starter were so delicious that we left very little chance to go for the main course. But whatever main course dishes we had were not up to the mark, particularly after the kebabs. ¬†And once again the dessert section was perfect to round off the evening. Other than that regarding the ambience and the hosts, it was certainly one of the better experiences I have had in the recent past.

In 2014 Durga Puja, I went there for the Dinner. This was my first Buffet experience in any restaurant. So I was pretty excited. As already I had seen their menu and price, so everything was in my mind. Yet it was Durgapuja but fortunately did not need to wait to get table. That was a Dry Day, so no drinks option was for us. So let's talk about the Food.. 
Menu wise the items were nearly same what one can experience in buffet in other restaurants in kolkata. But quality wise it was indeed satisfactory, especially the Kabab section. But in the Main course I found nothing exceptionally great. But overall my first experience of buffet at any restaurant was good enough.

I went to this outlet on Poila Boisakh with my family.
As Grill Restaurants go, they had a variety of non veg kebab and veg nibbles as starters and we ordered a strawberry kiwi smoothie along with it.
After having 4 rounds of starters I didn't have space for the main course so I skipped it and went to dessert.
The dessert section was exquisite and the presentation was quite nice.
There was fresh fruits, multiple flavors of Ice cream, Malpua, Rosgolla and Gulab Jamun, and two flavors of Mousse.
All the items were delightful and overall a great experience.
Would be visiting again soon.

Flame & Grill, located at Mani Square has quite big place and yes they excel in buffet offering. Since it is big place a family dineout is a very good option here. Kebabs come as starters and after having starters you often want to skip the main course. But they offer really nice main course. Coming to desserts, several offerings are there. 

Price wise it is great! Recommended buffet place in Kolkata!

I went for the dinner buffet with my friends yesterday(14/04/2017); my treat :/ This was my second visit to the place, but thought of writing this review now. The buffet is similar to any other kebab buffets in town, akin to Barbeque Nation and Sigree: an excellent platter of kebabs, a mediocre main course and mouth-watering dessert.
The kebabs were outstanding, the chicken wrap and the sheekh kebabs being the ones to look out for. However the fish kebabs were bland and flavourless.
The main course were as usual simple and unimpressive, and clearly after the huge kebab intake, not many people try the main course. Although the chicken biriyani and the mutton rogan josh were surprisingly good.
Now the desserts...in one word...marvellous. Firni, chocolate cheese cake, lemon cheese cake, rosogolla, gulab jamun and butterscotch mousse...with Mango ice cream being the icing on the cake.
In short Flame and Grill is a great place to try-out and even though there are a lot of buffet joints in Kolkata, you might not want to give this a miss.

A grand restaurant, no doubt.
Very spacious, situated at the top floor of manisquare mall. 
We were the first ones to have lunch there.
In the starters we had ajwani fish kebabs,chicken kebabs,mutton seekh kebabs,prawn grilled kebabs,chicken wraps,salads and a complimentary lime soda drink. The lime soda has two flavours -salted and sweetened. We prefer sweetened one.
We didn't waste much time with starters as our sole purpose was the main course. They also had vegetarian starters like paneer,aloo preparations.
In the main course they had vegetarian food like aloo gobi,paneer tikka,sabji masala,steamed rice and many more. we had only non veg mains like gosht biriyani,chicken homemade curry, chicken lababdar,chefs special fish. We expected a little more variety of mains. Food was good. Service was fast enough. Ambiance beautiful. Music was also nice.
In the dessert section they had phirni.. Different flavours of mousse..Papaya,watermelon,gulab jamun,icecream,toppings and syrups,chocolate tart.
Overall a very food-friendly experience!

The place is more or less same as Barbeque Nations except that it is quite pocket friendly. I visited Flame and Grill (Mani Square Branch) today i.e. Sunday for dinner and found the place quite crowded. The starters and  main course were good but I found the desserts delicious. I visited this place for the second time and I had no complaints against it. I would like to suggest all the foodies out there to visit Flame and Grill atleast once. :)

I have been here during mahalaya of 2016 with my best friend and cousins.
Per head costing including tax was 891/- 
The starters were really amazing.
I had tacos and prawns which were the best out there.
Also their desserts are pretty good,though there is room for improvement for desserts.

Our corporate team lunch was being organized here . The ambience is classy and Cozy perfect for corporate lunches. The starters included chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken wrap, mutton  sheek Kabab, prawn Kabab. Personally I liked chicken wrap. Then comes the main course. It contained chicken Biriyani, egg masala, palak prawn, mutton Kasa etc. In desserts there are a lot of options. Mousse, ice cream,moong  daal halwa, rosogolla, gulab Jamun etc. Overall the food was good. And we got kingfisher beer as compliment.

Buffet place number 8 on my review list and gracefully added to my collection of Buffediction. This place ahs been long pending in my to-visit list since it is one of the oldest buffet places in the city. Dine 5 and pay for 4; ICICI bank card holder's offer. The first thing we remember on entering the place was taking a sneek peek at the food counter. Seeing it elaborately spreaded we moved to our seats.¬†

For complementary drinks we had Beer, Fresh Lime, Pina Colada, Blue Lagoon as options. Unlike other buffet restaurants where the complimentary drinks are served on reserved days/ timings, Flame n Grill provide the option for all meals.¬†Convincing a vegetarian foodie is difficult for the chefs/ restaurants of the city and hence I had average expectations.¬†

Plentitude of options in grilled starters I must say: the usuals like Tandoori Aalo, Paneer Tikka, Mushrooms, Pineapple Salad and off-course surprises like protein rich Brocolli, Kurkure Baby Corn and my personal favorite Paneer Dhania Wrap containing thin cubes of cottage cheese which melted in the mouth.

Three rounds of Paneer wraps were ordered. My non vegetarian friends handsomely digged into Fish Fry, Chicken Wings, Kurchan Wrap, Prawns and Murgh Tikka.¬†

Assured of a contentful starting we waited patiently for our digestive systems to provide room for the next half ¬†while the entire place started to bustle and was full in 15 mins.

Nonchalantly I filled my plate with Corn Jeera Pulao, Daal Makahani (Must Try) and Kumb Hara Paya ( Mushroom and Peas Gravy). I decided to skip Panner, Subz Dum Handi( Boiled Peas, Carrot, Corn, Beans) and Assorted Breads. We didnt even bother to ponder over the Salad and Raita counter. Similar assortment were present in the non vegetarian counter.¬†

Undoubtedly, the dessert was the favorite part of our 2-hour journey. Banana, Paan, vanilla, Mango, Chocolate and Butter Scotch were the quintessential ice cream flavours available. Gulab Jamun, Badam Halwa and Rice Payesh were sitting high among the Indian desserts while Red Velvet cake, Blueberry Cheese Cake and Assorted Mousse adorned the remaining of the section.

Overall, a courteous and prompt service, an elegant and classy interiors along with the skillful selection of dishes is why this eatery is running successfully. I will definitely recommend it to my foodie collegues.

Its a paradise of kababs. I would suggest you not to take the cold drink combo with your buffet. Otherwise you have to sacrifice your delicious 'mouth watering' kababs. The main course was better than its competitors who falls within its band. But a better dessert range is required to get the best rating.

Went to Flame &  Grill for a buffet dinner  with office colleagues a few weeks ago.  The place wasn't much crowded since it was Thursday night. Food extravaganza was delightful.. Specially the starters. Khara masala chicken, prawn kebabs n Mutton kebabs need a special mention. The biriyani was excellent probably the best biriyani in a buffet in@ Kolkata, even better than its counterpart in  BBQ nation / Sigree.  The crabs were delicious. Deserts were good too.  Prices are a bit steep compared to the quality and quantity of  other fine dine  buffets in Kolkata, still worth a try.

Totally worth it... well this is the very place where your non drinker mom takes s chill pill and click a glass with you... birthday, party, proposals, this is one cool place you must visit... and how can I not speak of lauki halwa... Yes I admit many would cringe their face hearing the name alone. Trust me I did the same... but then as soon as I tasted it.. lauki proved me guilty of judging by appearance... now that's a place where you must visit

A bit disappointed with this visit. Barbeque nation is way ahead when it comes to buffet places. Kebabs were okayish...mutton sheek kebab was good though and the prawns.. chicken wrap was horrible..there were no welcome drink and i had to ask fr the menu twice to see the full menu..service was initially very slow but they picked up the pace afterwards.
The maincourse however was very less appealing..the mutton rogan josh was way far from its original taste.. didnt like the biryani as well..just the naan was good...even the names of the dishes were wrongly displayed..desserts were okayish...mousse were too sweet...gulabjamun was good...extremely disappointed....never to visit again

On a busy Friday evening I ,along with my friends visited this restaurant placed at the last floor of Mani square mall. The decor was restrained with the manager offering a cordial welcome. The next thing we know, the grill pits are opened in front of us with burning charcoal and sticks of marinated veggies and   meat are being placed on it. There came the pineapple, the mushrooms, the fat potatoes, the fish, the chicken cubes. Ahh..They were delicious. All of them..But special mentions must go to the mutton n egg gilafi kabab, chicken wraps, pineapple, crispy baby corn. 
The mains were equally eventful. I loved the biryani which was light yet fragrant n moist, the garlic palak prawns, the methi chicken, the paneer gravy, the subzi pulao. The crab however cudnt manage to please me. Also don't miss the papaya chutney which might get neglected in the shadow of big names.
Desserts were comparatively disappointing as I had expected more. The mousse was good, the halwa too sweet, the gulab jamuns plump, and what can go wrong with an ice cream. I just wish there were more imagination in this section.
The place is good, the staff is helpful, the food is great, the cost is reasonable. What more can you wish for ?

#Flame&grill One of the best buffet place in Kolkata which are compared with Barbecue Nation.. But I find this one is better in quality, service, ambiance and more.. The price is extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food they are offering. The starters are great here, I liked prawn kebab &, mutton seeks.. 
The main course are also very yummy, specially Dal makhani, mutton Rogan josh, fish,biryani.. Pretty much variety they offered which all are good in taste and quality. 
Now coming to the dessert..which was average.. But overall experience was really nice. It's worth trying

Worst experience ever. I have arranged multiple corporate parties before,never had a more embarassing experience.Taste was awful,everyone from the team got stomach upset the next day.Behaviour of the staffs were not co-operating.From serving to arranging bill to take order, sheer callousness was eminent from everyone.When tried to negotiate with the bill amount,manager tried to offer 1 more glass of soft drink when reported about the incident (seriously!!) .

We had provided poor feedback, still ¬†nobody connected us after we left the restaurant. Even there was not a single phone call which implies they did not take the feedback seriously.

Each and every item was of poor taste , specially the prawn was like a rubber. The chicken tandoori was not cooked inside , only the outer surface was stuffed with spices. And I never had a worse tasting fish item in my life than the fish ball they prepared.

A big NO from me if anyone is planning to go to this place. The poor taste can be somehow forgiven, but 3 days of vomitting , uneasiness and stomach upset cannot be.

Shocked , disappointed and disgusted!

We had table booking for 30 people. Still we had to wait for grills. Unlike bar be que nation where the waiters dont evn let you sit idle for 1 min, we actually had to keep on looking for waiters to tell them wat we wanted in the grills next. I was infuriated so much, that we actually did not had anythng in the grills for the second time. Most of the times grills were empty. The waiting time was killing me after such an advance booking.

The saddest part is that the fish, prawn, chicken all tastes the same even after being difft. in color. 
Certainly not visiting this place any more

Probabaly everyone knows maniquare mall. So no more about location. Coming to the food. We visited last year Nabami early evening. This is one of the best buffet resturant in Kolkata. The range of starters is huge and mouth watering. That was the festival menu so variety was more as well. They need to work on their dessert menu though. Excellent food. Excellent hospitality. Make the desserts better to get the full rating.

Already listed in the top grades for its exquisite buffet spread, located in one of the best malls of kolkata ! 
Nice decor to begin with , excellent staff behaviour ! 
The starters are nice to start with for appetising further, the mutton and the chicken wrap paratha being much attractive ! 
In the main course, nothing much to say as main course never has been a strong point in any buffet ever ! 
In the dessert section , they have blueberry muffins ! The best I have tasted yet... Gulab jamuns are not so good, the ice cream platter is nice to go with !/
Overall a good try ! 
I believe more improvement needed in the main course secrion, but once again buffet spreads always rely on starters and desserts !

One of the good buffet option in the city. Starters are of similar pattern like Bba nation, while main course is not so attractive. Prawn sticks are great, had 4/5 sticks alone in each visitüòú. Deserts are almost same like other buffets. considering the budget -it's a nice option. I'm rating it at 4* only because Services are bit slow comparing to Bbq or Chai break.. But still a worth visit for buffet!

Appetizers simply superb outstanding.. Full marks on taste and varieties!! This section is far better than what barbeque-nation offers.
But the number of items in main course section is little less and the dessert section it is lacking very much.. In this section there is nothing any specialty just the normal ordinary one in compare to other restaurants offering buffet.

Very good ambiance, has enough space for family and for private parties.

The veg dishes were not filled at the buffet, he had to stand and wait for a very long time after telling the authorities also they were not filled. The rotis were cold. And the manager gave stupid reasons for all this.
When my father was about to leave the authorities denied to take the bill and irritated him. Though the waiters were good the manager specially Siddharth Pradhan was unable to resolve any issue.

This is also a good option if can't go to Barbeque Nation. This place provides you almost the same food as that of Barbeque Nation. I am an avid fan of Barbeque Nation and if I have to compare the Buffet spread of the two joints then I will still put Barbeque Nation a bit higher than Flam & Grill though will certainly come back here with high hope in future.

The buffet is splendid. The kebabs were awesome. The ambience is nice and warm and it feels very good to sit at place with soothing music and eat. The food was amazing. Its worth the money and the price is also reasonable. Good stitting arrangement, staffs are nice and services is good... Definitely visit!!

Yesterday the food journey of 3 hours at flame and grill was fantastic. From the kebabs to salads, mocktails to deserts was mouthwatering indeed. The mutton seekh kebab was excellent. Lasooni murgh was superb. Prawn was heavenly. All of it tasted awesome with chilled beer. I think i am running out of adjectives now. But the quality of the mutton kebab deteriorated as the crowd started to fill up the tables. I had a blue lagoon which was refreshing and just calmed down the taste buds and was ready to go at the mains and the deserts. Though i am not a big fan of mains at buffet places i just tasted them and it was quite good. But deserts and the salads were at some other level. The mousse was super light. The brownies tasted like the odd one out though. The sweets and the ice cream accompanied with choco chips and chocolate sauce was the icing the on the cake.
First i thought of rating 3.5/5 but the mangement took another 0.5 from serving to ambience and above all the behaviour of all of them was super pleasing. When we mentioned about the quality drop in the feedback form the manager came right away and apologised for it.
In all its full paisa wasool and i highly recommend to check flames and the grills ‚ò∫

I have been visiting Flame & Grill right since the time they burst on to the Grilled Kabab scene in my city... I remember back in 2009, their buffet services were priced at 295 only and the vast array of dishes on offer were simply a gastronomic delight... 
Over the years, numerous competitors joined the race, and F&G was left slightly behind owing to a rather monotonous menu.. Though not completely out of the race though as even on my latest visit this afternoon I found they were pretty full... The buy 4 eat 5 option is also a rather convenient option in case you are a huge team of like minded hungry folks... 
Enough said, coming to the food, I learnt they keep changing their menu every day and that is indeed a welcome change... The starters today consisted of delectable South Indian Chicken wings and Mutton Sheekh Kabab, a not so great Prawn Kabab, an Ajwani Fish Kabab which had far too much Ajwain for my liking and a Chicken wrap which was not bad at all... Though personally would have loved at least one more Kabab for the grills... There were veg stuff too but I never really cared about Veg Kababs... 
After numerous generous helpings of starters we were able to put the elasticity of our stomachs to full test by trying out the main course as well... That consisted of Kolkata Mutton Biriyani (it is a sin not to eat it anyways), Chicken Lababdar which was outstanding and a Mongolian Fish (a misfit of sorts but tasty enough)... You never really get the full hang of the main courses in these buffet oriented restaurants but we managed to have a fair share of that too... 
Coming to desserts, well we Bengalis can swear by anything sweet, so no matter how good the main course and the starters are, unless the desserts are good, the ratings are sure to go for a toss... Thankfully the desserts today were great as well comprising of a range of mousse's, brownies, Bengal special 'Lyangcha' and of course the ice-creams with condiments... 
Thoroughly content, though would have loved more Kababs and spice on the menu... The areas of improvement could be more prompt service and improving on the choice of complimentary drinks... There are far too many new players in this space and unless the old ones keep improving they are bound to loose steam soon...

the food was good no doubt . a nice place to go with your family. i went there for the dinner buffet with my family. the starter kebabs, main course dishes, desserts , everything was good. the indonesian roasted chicken wings were superb.. but i would suggest that ¬†sigree and barbeque nation would be better for buffets . i went there as couldnt get booking at bbq. around same price both the above places give you so many choices of food. as flame and grills is restricted to kebabs and north indian dishes.

On 24th dec went to flame & grill for lunch. The food was good special mention for the chicken wrap & prawn kebab, the ambience was nice bt the only thing which lacked is their  service. It was very slow if it would had been a little bit fast then my whole experience of dinning out there could have been nice.

If you're looking for the best buffet in town, it's definitely BBQ Nation. Went to flame and grill because BBQ Nation didn't have space. The chicken kebabs, though in abundance, didn't appeal to me too much as they were not soft and seemed pretty dry. The prawns were great though. The vegetarian options were not too appetising either and tasted slightly bland. They had a rather limited buffet for the main course and I only tasted the chicken butter masala which was standard but just lacked wow. The desserts were great and I tried every item from gulab jamun to brownies and the mousse. Small portions but excellent taste.
The ambience is average but the staff are quite polite and hospitable.

I went there to celebrate my friend's birthday.. I'll heartily appreciate the way the manager and the staffs arranged the cute li'll birthday cake along with the birthday song played in the background..That was really wonderful and each and every staff including manager courtesy was 5 out of 5. Now coming to the food section.. You will have one complimentary soft drink or beer. Starters were lip smacking good.. I specially liked the prawn and fish kebab.. also the mutton seek kebab was good.. I was so full with the kebabs that i ate main course very little.. Ah!! Yes cannot miss to appreciate the aromatic nonveg biryani.. that was insanely tasteful.. mashroom paneer fish chicken crab prawn each and every side dish were good. Chicken salad was also tasty.. Now coming to the dessert sectin mouse cake fruits ice-cream and a lot more.. I'm specialy happy with the staff's presentations.. will surely visit the place again..... :)

The buffet is splendid. The kebabs were awesome. You will not be able to stop yourself due to its taste. A suggestion - there can be another option for people to have only kebabs and not the main course and fix up the price, since at least I could not have the main course in all occasions where I went there.

The ambience is nice and warm and it feels very good to sit at a place with soothing music and eat. The staff was awesome, always someone coming up to us and asking if we need anything, and Always asking about the feedback, which is a very good thing. And they were always there to take requests.
Coming to food, as any great buffet places go, starters are the main attraction but i went on a day when they didn't have chicken on starters üòìüòì
But nevertheless, bengalis like fish too. The prawn, fish tandoori, paneer tandoor, chicken wrap, mutton kebab and chicken wings were great. So were the others but when you have the above starters you hardly bother about the other üòÇ
A bit of 7up with it was a great mix
Then the veg main course had good dishes and the dal and paneer was great. The rice pulao(i think) was a tad bit worse in comparison to those. The gobi was good too.
But what disappointed me was the non veg course. Only the biryani was good, but the chicken and fish dishes, the ones made don't go with biryani. They kinda became the deal breaker and though they may have tasted better alone but not together.
The last part is the dessert and the mousse and the pudding which were great but I'm not a big brownie fan so i can't comment on it. And the ice cream and golab jamun was good too..
Well in 789, you can't expect more, have a hungry stomach and give it a try.
Thanks flame and grills, will be coming back

This outlet was a complete disappointment as compared to the one in southcity which is under renovation.Since part of the specialty group so didn't had idea the service to the food quality both can be such failure at the same time. People not interested in serving, lack of variety and on top of that the food being served raw nd uncooked. Overall a pathetic service with horrible food. Please see attached the picture of bbq pineapple which I requested, and if ypu lucky will find the pineapple in that .Certainly not going back, Barbecue nation is far better.

I have been to this outlet of Flame & Grill earlier also and whenever it comes to any restaurant under Speciality group my expectations get raised.

Went for a team dinner, around 34 peoples. Booking was simple and easy as we just called them up in the afternoon and got a confirmed booking for that evening only on a Friday.

They have expanded their dining space with buffet counter in the middle of the space. The walls are decorated with nice wooden works and clay artefacts. Overall a nice ambience.

They started serving Veg items though we clearly mentioned...strictly Non-Veg ;). One re-iterating our request they said please have the veg items as non-veg will surely follow :D.¬†

There were in fact many veg items for Vegans, Tandoori Gobi, ¬†stuffed potato, tomato, Tandoori Salad (this was good), Paneer Tikka, the Amritsari baby corn was very dry for my taste. Also there was Mushroom.

In non-veg, they served us Sumatran Grilled Fish, which was awesome. Mutton Sheekh Kebab, Chicken Wings (not so good), Prawn Tandoori. Nothing much to specify as they were okay-ish. We talked to the chef as one of the chicken item was half cooked and he was apologised and promised to make sure that we dont face this issue next time. :)

In main course they had Hyderabadi Biriyani that day (I love their Calcutta Biriyani but sadly that was not served that day) along with Fish and Mutton.¬†

Now coming to the dessert, they did a good job with chocolate mousse, rice kheer, Gulab Jamun, Scoops of assorted ice creams, Jalebi (Jilipi) and Cup Cakes - these cup cakes were heavenly.

When a restaurant charges you Rs 921 per head for the buffet, it automatically includes a level of expectations that people hope are met with and unfortunately none of that happened. Not just the food but the disappointment you feel after paying the bill thinking if this was worth it makes the experience worse.

To start my list of cons, here it goes,
1. No complimentary beverage. I have no idea how they do not offer this for a meal that costs this much.
2. The starters were bland, none of them had that wow factor you get after the first bite. They felt like they were prepared 12hrs ago. Even the chicken wings were dry and oily.
3. The prawn starters were way too salty and this was the first time in my experience when my friends didn't want the starters to be repeated the second time.
4. Hoped for the main course to make up for it, but it just got worse. The mutton looked really good and I coupled it with plain rice but it had absolutely no taste! I felt nothing in my mouth and left the meal half eaten even though I wasn't even close to being full.
5. All the starters were sticking to that metal rod (stick?) and it was really difficult to pull the chicken or the fish or even the prawn pieces out without breaking them into a hundred pieces.

The only pros were,
1. Desert was good. I enjoyed the ice cream as I customized it with all my favourite sprinkles.
2. The waiters were polite and well mannered.

And that was it. I still can't believe that I had to pay Rs 921 for my meal which was worse than a 2.0 rated restaurant in Zomato. Don't think I'll ever go back.

Dessert section of Barbeque Nation is excellent in compared to rest otherwise food at F&G is very good. Just one complaint. Stop serving Basha fish in barbeque. It is tasteless. We got a complimentary soft drink as well. Staff were polite and well-mannered. Service was fairly quick. Was so much full with starters that could not try the main course. A good experience overall.

Writing this review makes me really sad because this place had been a favourite and holds a lot of memory for me. All I can say is that the standard of this place has fallen DRASTICALLY.
We visited this place last Saturday for dinner. The restaurant was almost empty with only three occupied tables including us. Coming to the food all I can say is the starters were ordinary can't even say good. But it is the main course that just ruined my experience. The mutton was smelly , even with so few people in the restaurant the food had no flavour or content.
And then to add to my misery a Cock roach ran across the rice! !!!!!
The dessert however were not disappointing at all and were really good. So I am attaching a picture of only that. The service was good though.
Hope they manage to revamp their standard and quality of food.

FAME & GRILL...

My first exposure to this place happened in the South City Mall outlet with my colleagues... The idea of customised grilling was an innovation that required self-service and involvement in cooking much similar to the travelling hippies who would barbeque their own food at night in camp fires.....
The best thing in the buffet are the kebabs - veg and non-veg - from paneer and potatoes to mushrooms and mixed skewers whereas from different flavours of chicken to bhekti, prawn, and mutton... Everytime we are so full with the starters that we never have sufficient space to download the other tasty main courses... Failure of our own menu-management programmes and success of their top chefs!

coming to the non-veg main course
mutton biriyani,mutton rogan josh,,mutton was tender and juicy.. Let me mention about there PRAWN MALAIKARI which tasted heavenly... ¬†mango anchaar was good..

coming to desserts..

After 11 long Years !!! 
I have ended this Year's Gandhi Jayanti with a get together with my high school buddies.  I thought it was also a great idea to start the Matri Pakkha with a get together with my college buddies hahaha It's not often that we get around to just having dinner and drinks and enjoy each other's company because, let's face it, work gets in the way and we all lead busy lives.  But when a friend or two comes home for the holidays, you really do need to make a point to have a reunion for old times' sake.


There was a lot of reminiscing from college days about classmates, professors, crushes, embarrassing moments and catching up with what we've basically been doing after college :) We had reserved our seats with a prior booking to avoid Sunday Rush in this festive season. 

Prior the buffet dinner started we had ordered Mojito which was resulted in a perfect start of the evening by adding perfect quotient of refreshment in our soul and body. 

Flame n Grill restarted their operation after a renovation hit the Festive season which is knocking at the Door.

Consumed lots of Kababs (chicken, Mutton, fish, paneer, mushrooms). It was a voluptuous journey of food and culinary accommodated with Crispy Baby Corn, Amritsari Prawn. We repeated one more round of Mojito which was keeping our souls really fresh and injecting fresh bloods in the middle of Flame n Grill trademark Buffet. 

After an hour and half we came to realised that we had not even went to Main Courses ...But horses for courses are always there ..

Ordered Sigree Punch special mocktail which was able to meet our dry day thirst not by tastes but by looks upto a point. 

Entered Main Courses ...
Hardly enough space left behind ...
But ...
The endless hunger and love for food could not stop us to stay back ...
Chicken Biriyani and Mutton took place in the right side if the dish ...
The lucrative and eye candy deserts still waiting on que to draw the end line to the explosive dinner buffet..

Really forgot the names of the most but taste buds are still asking for one more time ..

In a package it was a great journey which was ended by a complimentary cold drinks served on request , fulfilled by Sukanta (staff ) and approved by his manager. 

Thanks buddys to make it happened.
Great Way to start the Journey ..
Many many thanks to all of you tagged n untagged to make it memorable enough by adding flair in flame n Grill. 


It's too bad that some of our classmates weren't able to make it because of prior engagements but I'm hoping that there'll be more get-togethers in the coming months  n years .

Flame and grill has been ranked as one of the best buffets in the town. The restaurant looks pretty normal with no extra ordinary decor coming straight to the food, it starts with kebabs on grill. The kebabs include chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, prawn kebab, fish hariyali kebab, mutton sheekh kebab. All the kebabs are good and unlimited except the tandoori chicken and mutton kebab. The main course is a real disappointment. Plain rice, biriyani, assorted breads, chicken, mutton bhuna and rohu kaliya. The taste is average and specially the biriyani is a let down. Better were the veg items. 

In the dessert the moog halwa was brilliant. It also had assorted cakes, gulab jamun and ice creams. At 921 a.i., it's not value for money.

Last minute plan made on the evening before after Barbeque Nation showed themselves to be too busy to book a table for us. It was a get together of 6 old college buddies, and the place seemed perfect choice with good smbience without much of noise and  equally good food & drinks particularly starters. The buffet is a good option based on one's appetite. Honestly could not try half of the options as we were slready full after starters.

Been here with friends on a week day.
The very famous and well known Flame and Grill grabbed us with the calm and classy ambiance.
We were 3 of us and we went for a buffet lunch.
So coming to the starters we had chicken, fish in green sauce coat. Paneer tikki, broccoli, mushroom. Tandoori chicken and mutton sheak kababs, crunchy potato in khatta Mitha sauce.. Taste wise it was ok OK.. I would rate it as 3.5. well the variety was missing. We were provided with complimentary sweet lime water  which was great. Loved it.
Coming to the main course, they had biriyani which was nice, nun, paneer, Gobi, chicken, dal, pulao, palad, non veg salads, etc... Pretty ok ok.
Deserts again disappointed me..as there was not much of variety. Mouse cakes, gulab jamun, mong dal  kheer...that is all. I loved the moong dal ma preparation. 
Ambiance is nice
Service.. few of staffs are too nagging. They are rushing to pick up the plates from the table even if we are still having. This was too annoying.
Food is ok.ok.. expectation was a little higher.

One of Kolkata's most famous buffet restaurant, after barbeque nation.. 
Ambience- 3.5
Staff- 3.5
Starters- 4.5
Main course- 4
Dessert- 4
Their main fault is they are too late to serve starters, and repeat them.. it is their main draw back.. food is really tasty.. ambience is good enough.. everything is fine.. but their service is poor.. and 2nd thing, they need to start a prawn kebab in starters.. 789rs for lunch nd there is no prawn in starters is totally unfare..

I don't know how I missed rating this awesome buffet restaurant. Located at the top floor of mani square, it has an awesome buffet spreads. Varieties of barbeque starters, awesome main courses and delicious starters are it's speciality. It is very similar to BBQ nation. But buffet rate is a little high. It's been a long time I visited there, so its useless to comment on the food menu. But the ambience and staffs and food items were just awesome.

All the joints of the Speciality Restaurants group raises high hopes among the foodies & Flame & Grill is no different. It was in our wish list for a long time & decided to check their buffet spread on a weekday. Situated at the top floor of Mani Square Mall the place has made a name of it's own. The ambience, decor is quite nice & the staffs were courteous enough as expected from the Speciality group. 
Welcome drinks: We chose fresh lime soda ( sweet ) & it was usual, one can also choose among various soft drinks on offer .
Starters: We preferred mostly non veg starters though tasted paneer , mushrooms & potato among the veg items & and they were good though nothing extraordinary. In the non veg segment first was Teriyaki chicken wings & it was lovely though different from other restaurants offering the dish. It was drier than most other places yet tasty. Mutton Sheek Kabab was top notch. Fish Kabab was perhaps the best of the lot with very good quality of fish on offer. Chicken Kabab was a bit hard for my liking. Absence of prawn in starters was a bit disheartening for us . 
Main Course: We started with Dum Gosht Biriyani with egg and it was light yet of good quality. The Chef's Chicken  tasted ok . The Dhaniya Machchli was very good , again the quality of fish was great. Prawn was also quite good . The Masala Papad , veg & non veg salad also deserve mention. We were quite full at this point yet still had desserts to come .
Desserts: Assorted Mousse, Fruit Cake , Langcha , papaya & four types of ice creams were on offer . The best of the lot was Moong Dal ki Halwa , simply beautiful.
At Rs 789/- the buffet spread is not cheap but a foodie certainly will not mind the extra few bucks that will bring joy to his heart. 
I am an avid fan of BBQ Nation & if I have to compare the buffet spread of the two joints then I will still put BBQ Nation a bit higher than Flame & Grill though will certainly come back here with high hopes in future.

The place gets cluttered in busy hours very fast. This is a nice place to bring your family amd friends together.  The service is good. The food is great.

Starters: Loved it. The fish kebabs were my favourite. Prawns and chicken follow. The kebabs are really really tasty. 

The main course: The mutton biriyani was outstanding. The flavour, the smell, the taste all were equally good. The chicken and mustard fish were even better.

The desserts: You will love the dessert items...they are really something else. The cakes and custards are really creamy and tastey.

Rate: 9/10

Starters r OK, good maybe but main course is pathetic - bhindi, parval, yellow Dal, gobi. I mean who decides the menu. Total waste of money for vegetarians coz starters r not so exquisite & tasty to let u skip the main course. DESSERT r good truly but by the time of dessert you are angry enough to just walk out.

I chose this place for a family dinner last month as I had been here multiple times in the past with good experience.but what a disappointment!!! This place is a perfect example of quality degradation. There were baby cockroaches crawling in the buffet area. We pointed it out to the manager who was apologetic and got us accommodated at Machan, this place is in serious need of a makeover n pest control. Also the coriander theme they had for the starters was just not tasty, specially the prawns were totally a waste of time. They also gave us a bill discount, but the family dinner was totally ruined, it was a special day which could have been better, barbeque nation is a far better choice for grills.

All over a good Restaurant for Buffet Meal. But there are something they should add on, Comparing with Barbeque Nation, Flame and grill has no kulfi Center and also the number of desert Items are less than Barbeque Nation. They should add on some more non veg items in the main course, I guess. Else, the quality of foods are superb , the kebabs and tandooris are just well cooked and not over or under burnt. It's worthy a try.

Deserts were nice but they could include kulfi section like what barbeque nation does. Main course was okay whatever I tasted so can't comment on main course much. Could have been improved on Desert section bit

Located in mani square,top floor. We needed a lip-smacking  load of north indian food and flame n grill buffet was the answer. Loved every single item on the menu ,kababs were moist and perfectly cooked through , especially loved the tandoori chicken .Even the main course was very good ,which in most buffets is sadly lacking in variety or flavour, but definitely not here. We ate loads,simply loads, because it was so so good.
And finally the deserts - the selection is awesome,loved the mousse and the little cakes. Also there was a item -moong dal er halwa which simply made my day :) Lastly ,we finished with ice-cream topped with hot chocolate sauce!

Good Food!  Courteous Staff!  Well Managed Buffet! Been there for a Dinner. What I liked the most was the Ambiance. You are definitely gonna enjoy the food with the lovely decor.  Starters are good enough to fill up your tummy. Tasty!  Perfectly Cooked and Nice mix of spices. I chose non veg buffet spread but I liked their Paneer tikka the most. Prawns were just perfectly cooked.  Coming to their huge Main course spread -  I personally liked the Biriyani.  The mutton  was stiff. The flavor of coconut in Prawn malaikari was overpowering supressing the other flavors. Daal makhni could have been better. It lacked the creamy texture. Dessert section was good too,  nothing extraordinary to mention about. Overall a Good place with Good Food.

Went there with high hopes after listening to my sisters childhood memories about this place. Was delighted when I entered the place. Well decorates, courteous service. Starters were great, promptly served and ofcourse, delicious, every piece. But a shocker came in the main course. The fish item had pungent smell and left a bad taste in the mouth. Biryani tasted mediocre. The mutton was not tender and needed hard pulls and bites. It made the whole experience sour. But hope its one of their bad days. Would love to go back though cz it made even the prawn kebabs tasty. Hope second time my opinions would change.

VERY VERY disappointed in recent visit a week ago

Flame and Grill has always been a fixture in Calcutta's culinary map but now   one might be very inclined to question this given how the quality overall has sunk low.

I had booked a table for 6 for 8 :30 pm  and had arrived to find a very unclean and ill maintained restaurant. Cockroaches  were scurrying about  in the dessert section. The food itself(especially the main courses) was very bad, so much so that 3 members of my party, myself including experienced immense stomach troubles the next day. The general quality of the starters,which have always been a specialty here,  was nothing as good as before.

Given the high price menu, we would expect some level of maintenance from the staff but instead saw just about the same care given to cleanliness of food as in a roadside fast food joint. 

My only regret is that I didn't take the actual bill with me back home so that I could have posted a legitimate compliant on the Indian Govt Consumer forum. 

My advice to foodies:If you don't plan on seeing cockroaches fight over ice cream in the dessert stand, this is NOT the place to be.

This restaurant, located on the 4th floor of Mani square mall, is one of the top 3 "Grill eateries" of our city. Recently I had the opportunity to visit F&G by means of a treat by colleagues.
We availed of most of the "Off the grill" items that were available on the buffet menu. Ajwani fish tikka and Lemon coriander grilled prawn were awesome. Peeli mirch ka tandoori murgh was tasty. But the Malai chicken wrap dint impress me... Whereas the Paneer butter wrap was delish. Arabian lamb sheek kebab was not available. And the mocktail Pina Colada (Pineapple flavoured with coconut) provided a nice tropical touch to our dinner.
Having already stuffed myself with enough food, I chose to skip the main course as I wished to savour the Dessert platter to the fullest. Langcha, Malpoya, Payes were really yummy. The pineapple mousse and vanilla mousse were not good and the Chocolate ice cream disappointed me. The Shahi Tukda was delectable.
The outlet is small, with a meagre seating arrangement...we dint have to wait outside for seats though. The guest service associates are polite, although one of them managed to do an unintentional spill of an entire plate of kebabs onto my lap.
The price listed on zomato can be misleading. A dinner on a weekday for 5 people, even after discount due to an offer of "Eat 5, Pay for 4", cost us approx. Rs 5000. This is mostly because of the alarming fact is that the restaurant charges an extra fee called "Additional service charges" (this is apart from VAT for foor and liquor, service tax, Swachh bharat cess and Krishi kalyan cess) which cost us Rs 374 within that bill.
P.S. Recently the Central Govt. has declared the "Service charges" charged without the consent of customers as an "Unfair trade practice" and hence it is illegal unless the consumer provides express consent to pay.

I had been there with colleagues in team lunch. heard about its services and kebabs before, they really super cool. We opted for lunch buffet where they were offering fish tikka, lamb tikka, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori, hariyali chicken in starter!!!!! Can you have anything else after them where they were serving before we stopped? Well they had biriyani (mutton), chicken masala, and prawns in main course. they had some good options in desert like semui, moong halwa, chocolate brownies and yes KOLKATA rasgoolla too. enjoyed a lot. Awesome service... good food quality and yes, will be there again.

If you love kebabs, you will love this place. And if you love buffet and yummy deserts, you are going to love it even more.They give you a sumptuous meal, which will have you going back for more.There are many varieties of kebabs, both in veg and non-veg. The main course also has a good variety.And desserts, my god am I in love with the desserts here? That would be yes, absolutely yes.Next time¬†when¬†in Kolkata, I will surely revisit.

We visited on a Wed dinner, they were hardly anyone there as expected. So they weren't in hurry to bring the food. Starters started and almost after half an hour and after asking for n number of times they brought non veg starters. Majority of us were non veg but still for the first half an hour only veg were served and that too weren't good enough. Then came non veg which were one chicken one fish and one prawn that's it. Although there was few other items which were on the menu but it somehow did not reach our table. Non veg was bad very bad infact chicken wings tasted like it has got inspired from South Indian curry. So weer the main course, equally bad. The only part which was good were the desserts, no complaints regarding that. Much below expectations and very lazy service, least interested staff all loitering around for no reasons doing everything apart from serving and attending people there.

One of the best buffet deals in Kolkata. Its chain of restaurant actually.

Mutton kabab was outstanding. In main course Biryani was awesome & tasty, prawn fish is also finger licking . There were 2 Types of non veg salad i.e chicken salad & lamb salad. It was ok ok. In dessert section we had Chocolate Mousse, watermelon, Lyangcha , malpowa & four types of icecream. It was pocket friendly 732 including tax only. I will again visit here.

I think all my kolkata friends love this place for buffet. The veg quality is as good as non veg buffet. The staff works and respond pretty fast and quick. Though veg quantity is less than non veg. The veg starter is less than non veg starter and thats the reason why we vegans dont like to visit often.

Not at all worth it for the price. Coastal food festival was going on. Biriyani and kerala chicken main dish was really bad. Even street biriyani tastes better. Regarding welcome drink they should offer sweet lime soda because many people don't like vodka or cold drinks. They should have different dips for the kebabs like the other buffet places. They should have more salad options. Dessert was not upto the mark. In short I have wasted my hard earned 891 bucks.

It was¬†Friday and we opted for buffet. We went early so didn't has to wait for the seats. They provide a wide range of starters both veg and non-veg. Out of all the one which I liked the most is CHICKEN MALAI WRAP. I found this unique here and it tastes heavenly. After the starter we were almost full so could have a bit of main course. Chicken biriyani, panner¬†was good but didn't like the mutton dish. Coming to the desserts, it was huge with all sorts of pastries and mistis and ice cream. Overall it was a good try.

Another grill haven in Kolkata.

This place falls in the shadow zone of places like Barbecue Nation or Sigree Global Grill. The concept is the same but the quality and cost is both optimised accordingly. The bill won't make you feel like you just lost a lot of money in a stock market crash.

We went there for dinner a couple of times actually. We choose the buffet option. The kebabs were nice and tasty. Especially the fish kebabs, that clearly was the dish of the night. Main course doesn't have much weight, just like any other buffet location. The dessert had all common options, nothing out of the box really.
Ambiance wise it's a nice place too. Dates/business meets/get togethers, all can be worked up here. Staff is okay, not too enthusiastic, not too dormant.
To summarize, everything was upto the mark considering the price tag. 4 stars well earned.

After missing out on multiple chances to visit this place, I finally got to try it out. The place fashions a contemporary decor with a very comfortable seating arrangement. The lighting is good and the on-table grills are impressive. 

The wait wasn't for much long as we were served with the starters just within moments of getting settled in. We had brilliant helpings of Fish kabab which is really good here. The preparation was mild and simple, yet the taste very catchy and significant. Besides, we had Chicken kabab, Mutton Keema, Chicken Paratha, Roasted Broccoli, Roasted Mushrooms, Roasted Paneer and Crispy Babycorns. The Mutton was one of best I ever had. Chicken Paratha and Broccoli were sumptously delicious. 

In the main course section, we indulged in Naan with Prawn Masala, Fish Hariyali Masala and Mutton Biriyani along with an excellent concoction of Fish and Salad. 

The sweet dish section was not bad either. There were four flavours of Ice Cream, two flavours of Mousse cakes, a couple of tarts, Lengcha, Water Melons. 

This place has certainly lived up to my expectation. I am looking forward to it again hoping for more.

So we took main course first and got our seats as table was booked 1 hr before reaching there...In starter boneless fish Kebab was awesome ..more better than mutton n chicken..mutton galawati kabab was though good but chicken kebab was somewhat dry...in veg broccoli babycorn and paneer kebabs were there ..all r good...in main course buffet basa fish and prawn items were just too good..mutton Biriani was also good in taste chicken and mutton salads were there they r really good in taste ...though some of the veg items I didn't tasted..but my vegetarian friend told that were also very good .. staffs were asking whether taste n everything ok or not and anything we need more...in dessert watermelon was there ..and it was very refreshing..different ice cream flavors were also available with toppings in ur own choice..langcha as sweets was there...we left the restaurant 4pm when everyone left and they didn't force me to clear the tables as we entered last min ...as a whole the lunch buffet was really good in quantity and quality off course and as we were really hungry it made us full....everyone go there for kebabs but we really enjoyed the main course more than the kebabs (except boneless fish Kebab ) that made possible for late arrival....Lastly in comparison to BBQ Nations, Flame n grill served equally good starters n main course dishes ..

We had decided to celebrate mother's day lunch at Flame & Grill kolkata mani sq and to my surprise the restaurant is full of cockroaches. When we had started with the buffet initially three cockroaches had came crawling out of the sigree and then on the table, it was immediately informed to the waiter attending us and the manager after which we were shifted to another table.¬†

But then again when we were in the middle of our main course two cockroach's came crawling from the back of the seat. I had immediately called the waiter and the manager and showed them the insects crawling on the seat.¬†

pfa the image of the cockroach attached and encircled showing the insect.

It was a very bad experience, I believe the restaurant is in serious need of pest control. It is a shame to the reputation of Flame and Grill and God knows how many cockroaches crawl on the food while preparing it. Even though the manager had not charged us for the food and had apologized for the situation, but it is very very disappointing and frustrating. This incident has now ruined my mothers day lunch and its a request to Flame and Grill kindly maintain your standards of hygiene and cleanliness from the future.

It is also hazardous to all the people's health whoever are dining in this restaurant. It is high time they take pest control and cleanliness measures seriously.

If you haven't been to barbeque nation before you are going to love this place. But that's highly unlikely, as all foodies have been to barbeque nation atleast once! So after that this place was a lil bit of disappointment.. Didn't like anything on the buffet.

If you want delicious shikh kababs and best tandoori chicken with nice ambiance it is the right place.I will suggest to try their buffet.At first they had served us different type of tandoori chicken items and kababs,fish kababs,delicious prawns.It will be continued until you will be ready for main course.In main course you can get different  items of mouth watering chicken & mutton dishes with my favourite biriyani.Deserts are also nice.we had gulab jamun ,halwa,brownie,cake and ice cream.This is the perfect place for food lovers.Get as much as you can and people are so helpful and we get a discount because of our office id too.So if you love tandoori you won't miss this place.

Well i was very confused to rate it between 3 and 4 so stick to 3.5
Why 4?
I so love the concept of buffets and starters with it endlessly.
Being a big fan of barbeque nation, i believe I'm not the only one.
But the same restaurant (barbeque nation) also spoiled us with quality and quantity redefined in one place.

And there is the reason why 3?
The food was kind of a mixed bag
Some were good and sone are bad while some were terrible.
I don't know why.
Maybe it will take another visit to me figure that out.

In comparison to food money is more...I can't say I liked all the starters but yes I liked the prawn skewers in compasrion to chicken paneer etc ...Main course wr good but can b better...there should b more type of salads.. desserts r good...4flavours of ice cream with chocolate sauce n choco chips n nuts r there...I didn't like the brownie bcz one should have it hot. ..as soon as it cools down it tends to become hard n bcms impossible to cut with spoon...one can combine vanilla ice cream with it then u might like it...caramel pastry was acutally the best dessert of all... I ddnt like the mousse not a big fan of strawberry.

We were there for an office team dinner. The reservation was a breeze. The restaurant was fairly empty compared to other grill restaurants. Flame and grill is another restaurant from specialty restaurants pvt Ltd who have the best restaurants in Kolkata. The menu was exactly the same as sigree global grill. The food was exquisite. It is fairly highly priced. But the service and food was great.

It was my first time at f&g Mani square. I have been to the south city outlet a couple of times and impressed by the food there I decided to pay this outlet a visit. 
 It's a buffet place. Offering a variety of kebabs and main courses and desserts. 
The staffs are very friendly and quick.
Coming to the food 
The kebabs were all good except the mutton seek kebab which was awful .
 In the main course the chicken and fish preparations were just lip smacking delicious but the biryani could have been way way better. I couldn't find any flavor in it and some of the mutton pieces were tender and juicy while the other pieces were uncooked. 
 Desserts were just fine. 
Overall I would suggest the South city outlet and I would suggest bbq nation more.
Thank you

Last friday after watching a movie decided to have lunch here and to my greatest pleasure was dumbfounded to receive wonderful warm hospitality from the staffs.. Must say that it was a wonderful experience here and thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of starters, which was cooked so well.. I loved the stuffed chicken bread, mushroom kebab, fish kebab the most!! Well now moving to the main course I was a bit disappointed with the variety of dishes but whatever dishes were presented there before us tasted perfect starting from the Mutton biriyani to the chicken curry and to the end I must say that the sweet dishes stole my heart as I deeply enjoyed having those lovely delicacies! I rate it five for the ambience, good food and kind behaviour of all the staffs..

Hmmm.
We went dere @23rd April for lunch buffet.

Bangla bhasay bolle otibo joghonno.

Complimentary cocktail was served but no taste. Even lime water is far better dan "this" cocktail.

Starter: huge starters served on chicken,mutton,fish,prawn,potato and paneer and mushroom.

All d chicken items are almost same taste. Only mushroom was good.

Main course : salads were good.
Chicken items was average and mutton,prawn,fish items are also good.
Chicken salads were average...and rest n most items are average..not good too!

Even you can't access veg items too .

Deserts: moose, cake,sweet,halua all d sweet items are too sweet..Horrible.

There was 4 ice cream flavour( vanilla,chocolate,mango,truti fruity)

Believe me..even rs 10 ice cream bar are far better.

So my opinion..don't even try out this outlet @mani square

Better spent @549 buffet at chai break...you will get better taste.

One more thing. All the staffs are good in behaviour.

Visited this place yesterday. Nice ambience and service. The staff was very helpful and was courteous enough to ask the feedback for every dish. I was sweating a bit due to finger foods and also a bit of liquid sunshine. Seeing this the manager whose name was Anjan as far as I remember promptly brought a cold towel for me.¬†

Coming to food the starters were catchy with fish and prawn kebabs stealing the show. Rest of starters were also good and worth trying. I liked the chicken wraps as well. The main course was also okay and I liked the naan and chef's special mutton gravy. In fact I didn't had that much place left after the starters :) . I very much liked the dudhiya halwa that they had to offer in desserts along with your usual platter of icecream and muffins.¬†

Everything was organized and just for excellent staff service I am rating this place 5.

I have never been a huge lover of North Indian cuisines, but yesterday as I visited Flame & Grill, I had to change my mind! Be it the starters or the main course, the quintessential flavor of North Indian simply ruled over the food items. The starters were absolutely delicious and appetizing! The main course had a brilliant variety and what really intrigued my senses was the Muttion Biriyani, which was oh-so-yum! Let's not forget about the dessert which again had an assorted range of confectioneries. I loved the "Gulab Jamun"; it just melted in the mouth! The staff were too courteous and ready to help. I am very much looking forward to visit again!
Happy Eating!

Visited Flame and Grill last weekend. Located one top floor of Mani Square, it sits pretty amongst so many restaurants. I had visited this place once back in 2011, it had not appealed much to me then. But this time it turned out to be fantastic. The staff were very good and were quite hospitable. The Ambience is up to the mark. Coming to the food, we're pretty bowled over by the starters. The prawns deserves a special mention. Moving from the prawns, the mutton kabab was another star of the show. Rest of the starters like the chicken kabab and the fish items were all very good. Coming to the main course, we had mutton biryani. The desserts were all very good but lacked variety. Few more dessert items should be introduced to bring in more variety.

Flame N Grill @ Mani Square is a foodie favorite with the unlimited kebab and buffet on spread. A Sunday lunch with prawns costs Rs. 711.00 and without prawns Rs. 592.00 both inclusive of taxes. The service starts once you share your choice of veg/ non veg and goes on till you retire out. The buffet spread is worth tasting wit Biriyani, chicken, fish and mutton dishes and a excellent combination of desserts like hot brownies, gulab jamuns, 4 flavours of ice cream etc. Complimentary drinks are not served and the service is a bit slow. Else the ambience, food quality and taste makes it worth a visit !!!

Smoked up shack, grilled with the aroma of burning coal, it's place to dine in with family and friends. A live smoking pot of coal present in each and every table with tender meat and chicken lined up in skewers makes it perfect for a cool winter afternoon. I tried out the buffet worth 747/- inr, the grilled chicken tikka was tasty, I didn't particularly like the seekh kebab. The main course could have had something more, very limited in variety. Dessert was just fine, nothing great. Barring the starters everything was mediocre.

Flame and grill, located on the top floor of mani square is probably the most under rated buffet restaurant. I have been here 4-5 times but still it is really sad to see that it does not get the hype that it truly deserves, especially after the improvement in their food quality and service.
The representatives treated us well and provided us really good service.
Starters comprised corn-in-a-cup, chicken tandoori, chicken kabab, mutton seekh kabab, fish hariyali and prawn fry which were all well-cooked and delicious. The best of the starters was the CHICKEN CATILA WRAP(hope the name is correct) which was a preparation of chicken slices wrapped inside a paratha. I had to repeat this particular item numerous times.
Main course had chicken biryani, chicken and mutton kosha, prawn curry and basa fish; all of them tasted really well.
The dessert covered a wide range of items from vanilla and strawberry mousse to chocolate cookies to moong dal ka halwa to caramel cake and last but not least four types of ice cream(chocolate, mango, vanilla, tutty fruity).
In all, my experience was just very good and I am surely going to visit this place regularly.

Properly located at the top floor of mani square, this is one of the finest grilled buffet restaurants in the city. Firstly,the staffs are very courteous and prompt in service. The ambience is good and very soothing for a family dinner.

Coming to the food--the appetizers(served hot over a grill at your table) is mouth watering and an appetizer buff like me could possibly finish off the meal only having such variety of appetizers and grilled chicken and jumbo prawns and mutton seekh kabab. The chettinad wraps taste perfect with the correct amount of filling.

The main course include a lot of dishes like prawn malai curry, mutton biryani(chicken biryani not served here),fish kalia and some variety of veg dushes as well that includes steamed rice,polao,paneer butter masala. After such great combo of starters,the main course maynot be so exciting, but is managed extremely well by such fine desserts!! Be it the variety of mousse or the strawberry pavlov,flavors of ice cream or the fresh baked gulab jamun,it gives an awesome end to a meal. Overall, a must visit!!

The false and grill at mani square is somehow smaller! The service is faster and warm! The serve only buffet and that's what bring people here! The food quality has gone down like crazy! The kebabs are hard, generally served cold! The maincourse  is all the more not well cooked! Having better options for buffets where food is good... I would not choose or recommend this place to anyone.

Grilled food buffet, kind a common thing in town now a days. I have tried quite a few buffets in different cities e.g. Barbeque Nation, Sigree etc. And today finally following my ex-girlfriend's humble suggestion I went to this place for lunch with my parents. I have realized now how great her choices are. In Kolkata this place has one of the best buffets in its category. The food is finger licking good. I usually don't eat fish but I had 5 servings of their barbecued fish. The menu was simple, not too many things to make you feel overwhelmed. Yet you'll eat them with a great satisfaction. We took a cocktail drink that had Vodka in a juice made of lemon and mint. It was very balanced in terms of the ratio. Over all, me and my parents are truly satisfied with this place and we have finally found our favorite buffet. Last but not the least the behaviour of the staff members was very humble. So if you are around, give it a try you'll surely like it.

The buffet is mainly centred around chicken and fish. With the usual burnt, smokey aroma the kebabs atop the slick metal rods are mouthwatering. What is liked specially is the fish , something that I generally avoid (yes,some bongs do avoid fish) throughout the year in every possible 'jhal and jhol' form it has. The fish was a delight to taste , with a buttery texture and paired with mint chutney I had quite a few of those. The main course started with Biriyani , and even though it lacks the lip smacking and cholesterol rich taste of Arsalan , I wont be denying that I wasn't longing for some more after tasting it initially and a bit apprehensively. The pieces of mutton were tender and well cooked. The shrimps cooked were simple yet reflected quality and freshness of the marine delight. The abundantly gravy laden dish was simple , and I chose to avoid the gravy and rather go for the shrimps only while tasting it. Wrapped up everything with different types of desert , including gulab jamun ,ice cream( included toppings of choco chips, mango,strawberry and off course chocolate syrup ). Overall , the quality of the staff and the ambience is quite a good deal for a pocket pinch of 751 per head

Located at the very top floor of Mani square. Excellent place to enjoy grill food. They have a very nice ambience. They provide a buffet menu which contains very nice grilled items along with main course.

If you want to enjoy grilled items and kebab you need to visit this place must.

If you are looking for north indian buffet in town, this is the place. They have a huge spread buffet with live grill right on your table. A variety of both veg and non-veg is served. The kebabs were delicious. Their main course spread is also irresistable. But the best part was the desserts where they have assorted mousse, gulab jamun and a variety of desserts. It should be on your bucket list of buffets I must say.

Let's just admit it that, if you have a nag for roasted and grill food cuisine, well this is definitely one of the place where you should be. One should go well prepared or probably empty stomach to take a full blow of the meal served here. Went for a casual dinner on an evening.. But ended up loving this place. A food buffet so delicious you can't stop yourself from sharing the experience with others. 

Well to Start of with the starters (clich√©d) :P, they serve a variety of it I personally liked the chicken chettinad wrap, caramelized chicken wings and the lamb. The chicken wings were a bit sweeter, but liked the taste they offered in between. The lamb specially was so tender and juicy,it just melts in your mouth. Then comes the typical chicken kebabs, prawns and fish. And they served the purpose well. Enjoyed gorging on them all. 

And as usual I was so filled with the starters and kebab that the mere thought of going for the main course gave me nightmares. But made my mind and stomach to try out few. Had the sabj biriyani and paneer malasa and to be true they were really good. 

After all this if you still have a stomach to pleasure your sweet tooth, which atleast my stomach does :D you can try the desert section. They server some awesome quality deserts starting from the moose, pastries, gulab jamun, doi, ice-cream and what not. 

The best part is the price they charge for all this, is worth every penny spent and won't pinch your pocket much either. In all this place is a must visit for all food lovers.

The buffet platter is probably one of the best in Kolkata. Ranging from a wide array of kebabs for starters...to lip smacking main course...and..innumerable desserts to suit the taste buds of one and all. A place worthy of several visits. Its a value for money place.
(Top tip: don't go on an overdose of starters or else you will miss the main course which is truely delicious because of lack of space in your tummy üòú)

This is my 3rd visit to this outlet of flame and grill located in Mani Square mall. I first visited here in 2012 and it was my first ever buffet experience. The last time i visited was back in 2015 . Never before have i managed to write a review for this restaurant. I did finally manage to go back there again today and with a very heavy heart i have to see that the experience has deteriorated.¬† I have attached the buffet menu so that you can have a clear idea as to what is laid on the table. Please find below the individual ratings to let you decide on what to eat and what to skip.

Starters :

1. Bhoot Jhalokia Chicken tikka ( 3 / 5 ) <-- Normal chicken starter
2. Hariyali fish tikka ( 3.5 / 5 ) <-- Normal fish starter based on basa fish
3. Anda Gilafi seekh ( 3.5 / 5 ) <-- Nothing fancy, mutton boti kabaab.
4. Afgani tandoori murg ( 3.5 / 5 ) <-- Tandoori pieces but sadly has bones.
5. Lemon Chilli grilled prwans ( 4 / 5 ) <-- A must have
6. Chicken chettinad wrap ( 4 / 5 ) <-- A must have , a different type of starter.

Complementary drink -- > Aam panna ( 4 / 5 )

Main Course :-

1. Nawabi Mutton Biryani ( 3 / 5 ) <-- dry biryani , plain bland non spicy mutton pieces.
2. Murgh Do piyaza ( 2.5 / 5 ) <-- Nothing special , most guys skip.
3. Patiawali macchli ( 3 / 5 ) <-- Different taste but then again basa , nothing special
4. Curry Patta prawn ( 3.5 / 5 ) <-- Curry patta adds a different flavor the only dish from main course which was interesting.

There was once a time when i used to thing Flame and Grill has better main course than BBQ nation although most of the people concentrate on starters in a buffet. But it is the mutton pieces in the main course that still remain the star attraction in any buffet and i must say i was very very disappointed . The mutton pieces in the biryani was bland and not soft at all . The "nihari gosht" from BBQ nation is the dish that every restaurant serving buffet should take inspiration from . 

I have not mentioned any items from deserts separately as they were okay. The only section where i did not have much complains . The names of the dishes can be found in the attached menu . A special mention should be given to :-

1. Moong Dal halwa
2. Assorted mousse.

People who are not new to the buffet experience would not find anything new here so like me will find a visit very very average. Newcomers can always try like i once did back in 2012 when my taste buds were still inexperienced. But when you have a competitor like BBQ nation i would advise the owners to step up and reinvent the menu . Otherwise , it would end up being just another restaurant , something i do not want flame and Grill to be .

To start off...the ambience is perfect and being a week day, low traffic, one could have the perfect setting for a laid back sumptuous lunch...otherwise also, the layout, concept of a barbecue in the middle of the table, lighting....all this combined, the setting for some 'me time'...so for this start off with a 4/5

The value for money is terrific, 9 starters (the fish kebabs are worth mentioning üëå), 10 odd items for lunch and desserts/ice cream....all in a good mix of non veg....price tag ‚Çπ1550 for two....full on 5/5

The main course doesn't disappoint at all either....through the entire lunch, the taste was great and overall quality was quite good...so here's another 4.5/5

But, i am a conservative, so would go only with a 4/5 overall....lets see guys, what you got up your sleeve next....what's the next stage of evolution ‚ò∫

Whenever I visit this place, I find myself mentally comparing it to BBQ Nation. I first visited Flame & Grill in 2011 and has pleasantly surprised at the varied amount of the menu that they have managed to retain. My recent most visit was in late 2015 and am happy to note that the standards remain pretty good. 
The barbecued starters are varied and tasty. The mains offer good variety but I find the dessert platter rather boring. It seems like innovation has lost its touch here and the offering is repetitive and mundane. Hope to see things improve in the future.
Though we do manage to get a table most of the times, going without reservations can be a bother, especially on weekends. Also, would love to see the staff pull up their service by a few notches as they seem preoccupied most of the times and confusing orders amongst tables os something I have faced more than once.
All in all, a decent place with a slight pocket pinch.

Liked the ambience and the service. We opted for the buffet for a bunch of 4 people. The starters were obviously better than the main course. I liked the chicken wraps the most. Even the mutton kebabs were very soberly cooked. The broccoli kebab was nice too considering the fact that I hate broccoli but I had a lot of it. The potato and the mushroom kebabs were disappointing though. I really wished there were prawn kebabs as well. The main course was normal. Desserts were great!
Throughout it was a fine experience, because when you spend 3k for four grownups for a non veg buffet, you expect something extraordinarily good!

Worst ever !!

I m very regular at BBQ NATION, mainland China, flame n grill. So I know their hospitality and behavior.

Last 31 I went at FnG Mani Sqr and made a mistake, sujit (the waiter) was worst part of the lunch. He asked me " r kichu repeat korlam na", I asked them for paper napkin, they gv me  toothpick, never pour water in my glass and so on. If anyone want to enjoy their date plz avoid FnG Mani Sqr and specially Sujit (the beyara)

The food is simply superb. The ambience too cool. The food is in abundance and they are all equally lip smacking. The menu to try is the non- veg sea food buffet.... 

It comes with Prawn n Fish Kebabs as well. But for people not too fond of Sea food can go for the normal Non Veg buffet spread.

The starters are so filling that it actually leaves very less room for the main course ... But it is anyways really good. A meal is a tad expensive but it is worth every single penny

This place disappoints. The buffet spread is sad and should have been much better. Service is not worth talking about either and the pricing also seems to be on the high side especially given the spread on offer. In terms of taste as well, this is just about average. Given the multiple options, you can and should avoid this place.

This place offers a full course buffet at a moderate price. And they served us a glass of vodka too, as a complimentary drink. :)

Flame and Grill never fails to impress you. The Buffet is reasonable but their service lill too fast. Once you start your kabab they'll just put all of it onto your sigree. The buffet menu are good and one can find his/her choice. The only thing that tops on everything is of course the kababs. Had my birthday treat there and that was good memory spent there. Hope to visit again.

When you spent around 850 bucks on a non veg buffet, you expect something bliss.
No, Its Flame and grill is not that what  I expected.
Starters ware slowly served and and all of them were not up to there best.
Deserts were good but why no gulab jamun??
In starter I liked the prawn, and chicken but extremely disappointed with the mutton seek Kabab. 
Main course were standard but salad options were less. 
850 was not justice to the food we had. 
Sorry guys, but I am just being honest.

I came to know about this really cool offer the other day. Its a take out only thing. Its a platter of 16 pieces kebab- chicken, mutton, fish and prawn and costs just 350( incl taxes). The food quality was good and the packing was such that you can take it to far distances. I was surprised this isn't on their menu or on zomato. Thought I'll share it with others. Both mani square and South city outlets have this offer. You need to specifically ask for it. ;)

Food is okayish. Hated the ambience and particularly the discourteous manner the staffs were handling the orders. Lack of options in kebabs and they are totally not bothered about it. Just think, in a mixed platter of kebabs of veg and non veg varieties, we found only two edible options. Mushroom and potato. Any ways, totally unexpected from a specialty group restaurant.

Been here couple of days ago on the eve of durga puja for buffet..
Was greeted with 'no welcome drinks', and when asked a staff about it his direct response was 'kichchu nei', I understand the rush they were handling due to Durga puja, but friendly attitude from management is what we expect and deserve..  Anyway moving on, starters on charcoal were good in taste, we had to ask for veg grilled items multiple times as we booked for nonveg buffet.. Platters were limited to only 2 items of fish and chicken each.. Main course were just fine with biriyani, meat preparations, and same in desserts - satisfying..
I feel the amount they are charging ( more than 850/- including taxes), is much on the higher side compared to the food they are serving.. Management should be more prompt and customer friendly..

About food quality,It's perfect as expected... But I've noticed and it's weird that waiter serve only Fish Fries repeatedly instead of mutton kebab or chicken varieties  untill request.Then,they 're forgot that I have ordered soft drink üòä But its quite manageable. Food Taste is upto the mark. Desserts part,Moose should be well decorated. Otherwise F&G have done a #Great_Job!!!

Was here on Sunday afternoon for lunch, the manager had offered me a table next to the buffet table, because it was too crowded. I refused to sit near the buffet because I am a vegeterian and the aroma from the non-vegeterian food is a little annoying to me.
A waiter guided me to another table of 4 which was just next to the cashier. I told him that we would like to go to some other table as me and my wife would like to sit facing each other rather than sitting side by side (there was a pedestal fan kept on the opposite side of the table which restricted access to the front two chairs).
He requested me to be seated and would shift me as soon as another table was empty.
I was waiting there for around 20 mins but no one bothered to serve us water or even arrange the cutlery. After this I asked the cashier if it was possible to ask someone to serve water, the cashier engaged some waiter to serve us water but he did not turn up for another 10 mins.
I walked out of the restaurant after this.
I had visited the south city outlet of the same chain and I had loved the food and hospitality.
Here, food was out of question, hospitality was pathetic.

Flame and grill is offering one of the best buffets in town. I visited the south city outlet but the mani square is for the first time.Had the puja special buffet which is 885 for non veg, including taxes. The food is good and service is very good. The staff r polite and serves well. Items r not many but they taste good.
Starters- tandoori chicken - cold and not good, achari machli tikka - superb and best of all , murg tikka kabab - very soft and tasty, prawn tandoori - good, mutton seekh kabab - dry and not good
Main course - didn't try the veg items. Mutton biriyani - very well cooked with soft mutton, prawn malaikari - good, machli hara bhara - coriander base basa fish, very bad taste, dum ka murg - superb taste, mutton rogan josh- very tasty with soft mutton. the main course was really good , quite unexpected in a buffet spread. 
Desserts- desserts are not so good which was a bad point. Although the main course and starters could compensate. Few cakes which r not good and quite dry. Chocolate n nut brownie not at all good. Few tarts which we didn't try, baked mihidana which was the only good item,in fact very good. Misti doi and few ice creams with choosable toppings.
The cost is 1770 for two including all taxes. Overall experience is good although the variety of items r less compared to other restaurants. Specifically the starters, only 5 items is quite less for 885 range. Anyway the taste is good so you won't regret.

Visited the outlet during Durga Puja. The pluses: buffet dinner  so not much wait time even without table reservations. Well located so easy to find out. The food is good. The minuses: extremely loud music, waiters pretty impolite and seems like being in a tearing hurry to see you finish. The warmth and the ambience was missing for the price paid. Disappointed.

Flame and grill is offering one of the best buffets in town. I visited the south city outlet but the mani square is for the first time.Had the puja special buffet which is 885 for non veg, including taxes. The food is good and service is very good. The staff r polite and serves well. Items r not many but they taste good.
Starters- tandoori chicken - cold and not good, achari machli tikka - superb and best of all , murg tikka kabab - very soft and tasty, prawn tandoori - good, mutton seekh kabab - dry and not good
Main course - didn't try the veg items. Mutton biriyani - very well cooked with soft mutton, prawn malaikari - good, machli hara bhara - coriander base basa fish, very bad taste, dum ka murg - superb taste, mutton rogan josh- very tasty with soft mutton. the main course was really good , quite unexpected in a buffet spread. 
Desserts- desserts are not so good which was a bad point. Although the main course and starters could compensate. Few cakes which r not good and quite dry. Chocolate n nut brownie not at all good. Few tarts which we didn't try, baked mihidana which was the only good item,in fact very good. Misti doi and few ice creams with choosable toppings.
The cost is 1770 for two including all taxes. Overall experience is good although the variety of items r less compared to other restaurants. Specifically the starters, only 5 items is quite less for 885 range. Anyway the taste is good so you won't regret.

The restaurant with the concept of barbecuing your starters on the table is what attracts customers here. The food however is average and the service is mediocre. I would not compare it with barbeque nation in any aspect.

Visited the outlet during Durga Puja. The pluses: buffet dinner  so not much wait time even without table reservations. Well located so easy to find out. The food is good. The minuses: extremely loud music, waiters pretty impolite and seems like being in a tearing hurry to see you finish. The warmth and the ambience was missing for the price paid. Disappointed.

Located top floor of the Mani Square Mall..
Went there for soshti special dinner.
Loved there food menu..o think they provide 2 nd best buffet after barbeque nation.
Food menu-
STARTERS - starts with chicken salad and mutton salad.that is awesome in taste.after that we take grilled items. Chicken boneless kabab, with bone kabab, prawn kabab, fish fries, galowti kabab and all..with special dhania chatni..
All the kababs are good in taste. But prawms are little bit dry.
MAIN COUSE- In main course they serve ghost biryani with egg chicken kosha mutton rogan juice fish curry prwan with lemon sos.
All the main course items are really good in taste..I think bettr than kababs..all the peoples who went there they ate lots of kababs then skip the main couse..but I did just opp of it..I ate lots of muttons in biryani and ate prawns. .yumm in taste.
SALADS- salads are also good..diff kind of salad..verry good in look wise also.
DESERTS- they provide different kind of desserts..hot gulab jamun, doi, mishti, chocolate sondesh, pastries, mihidana, 4 typs ice cream, fruit custered etc..I dont remember all the things actually.:p
They take 887 per head for the puja special price..that is costlyi know but they provide all kind of dishes.fish prwns mutton chickn etc etc. So they should charge that money.
We take 2 fresh sweet lime soda too..for that we can ate actually :D
 
Again went there yesterday (31st jan)
Its sunday dinner..uff awsome starters..variety of appetisers..they serve chicken egg cheesyy wrap..that was fantastic really..
I lyk fish kababs too..green fish kabab..prawns are good cooked..lovely deserts..veryyy tasty all of main course item..but previously they serverd mutton biryani with boiled egg n all.that I like most..but now they serve chicken biryani..:( only disappointed item is this and without egg..anyy wayy may b most of guys lyk chickn biryani thats why..but after eating lotsss of starters item seriously cant eat main couse properly..

First of all a big thank you for the complementary cake on my birthday! 
Yes it was my birthday & we went there for buffet!
First thing you notice is the ambience which is super amazing. Secondly the behaviour of the ppl out there are too good & finally food the most important part--they serve you very good quality food out there with variety as well. 
In the spread I think they are better with the desserts if compared to the starters & main course (though they are nothing less)
But I guess now you have made it a little more expensive than before which makes my pocket cry :(

A good place to visit with family, friends and colleagues, but not a place to be repeated frequently as their menu remains more or less same throughout the year with an exception to seasonal fruits in the dessert menu.
The grilled variety is very tasty (prawn being my favourite) and can get filling to the point where one may skip their main course (happened to me many times).
Main course here is just passable, nothing exceptional. Dessert is good, but would be better if they could increase an item or 2.
Good ambiance with well spaced out seating arrangement. Service is good.
Overall, a good experience

ambience was very good service was also nice....but the restaurant was about to close and the waiter just informed this about 15 mins earlier however it did remain open for us....

mutton sheekh was awesome,fish was OK(generally I like fish in restaurant), Reshmi chicken kebab was good,babycorn wasn't that great,noj veg salad was too good,prawns -I did not like at all,we asked for mushroom barbeque and yes it was good.. ....for starters there should have been more of a variety but OK not bad good it was....
non veg main course completely a flop.....yes the chicken curry was comparatively OK(infact good).....comparatively the veg main course dishes were a thums up.....
deserts were nice.....but ice cream wasn't that great of a kind.....brownie with chocolate sauce was good anguri gulab jamun was good.....pastries were nice......
when I went we got a complimentary cocktail(with vodka and I don't remember)... we had Chivas regal 30 ml and got another free :)....more or less u might try....good it is....but  not the best certainly

If you become impatient of entering with kebabs, Flame & Grill is one of the names that pops up in your mind. Same thing happened to me and had lunch there with my friend. It was not very spacious but well maintained. They started with Aam Panna, a beverage flavored with roasted cumin powder which was really cool. In starters they served chicken kebabs, prawn kebabs, mutton kebabs, fish kebabs(Basa Fish), mushroom kebabs etc. The chicken hariyali kebabs were small sized, soft in short simply yummyy!!! I took fish kebabs many times as it was a clear winner. The prawns kebabs were dry. Frankly speaking, starters mede me really happy. The Paneer item was the only thing that is worth remembering. But man!! if you enter into dessert section you simply get confused which item to start with. Opted for Strawberry cheese cakes, Pineapple gateau, Paan mousse, Apple flavoured mousse, Gulab jamun, one kheer item and four different flavoured ice creams(chocolate, mango, vanilla and tutty fruity). Paan mousse leads the way while tutty fruity gave me a perfect end.

Gluttony is a sin. But we love much anything that screams all-you-can-eat. It's the dare that's interesting, and the after effect is always dreadful. Twice I have been there, once they forgot to give us cold towels, and the other time they did not serve enough Tangri. I am taking offence on those now. But, one thing I do not get- Why on earth they do not serve veg appetisers samples when a diner chooses to have non veg. At least, it is not mutually exclusive from a non veg eater's POV. Right?

Now coming to the service...they are truly exceptional with their friendly and commendable service. A must visit place for everyone. Happy Eating...:)

Well Honestly speaking I was a kill let down..recently I had my team dinner in here and the food and service was way below expectations... It was on my request my team agreed to dine in here but it was a disappointment...
First let's talk about the service..It was way too slow I mean we had to keep on waiting for our kebabs for a good 5 minutes to be refilled...I don't know was it a regular practice or its was just a bad day...Even the air conditioning was not proper I even asked the manager to turn down the temperature I was literally drenched in my own sweat but manager's reply to me caught me a surprise he said it was the live grill which was making my surrounding warm..I mean come on man this was not my 1st time on a live grill dinner...you really Ned to pull up ur socks here dear management
Now the food it was not as per the standard...we expect a very descent quality of food when its Flame & Grill chicken pieces are all broken and in even lack of flavour and aroma I remember when I was in barbeque nation we were filled till our through but still wanted to have more where as here it was just the opposite in flame & grill...
Pls guys improve the service...

Visited this place very recenty. Ambience is good as expected being a place from such a brand. Staffs were customer friendly. We went there around 10.30pm didnt find any tiredness from the staffs. They were all happy to welcome us even at so late hour. Food quality is good. Had complete non-veg items only. Starter and main course choice were not great in terms of number of items. But qualitywas good. Didnt like the mutton kebab though. Feel it can be improved since same kebab I had in some other placesand they were way ahead on this item. Fish kebabs and specially prawn was good. In main course again not much choice but quality was perfect. Had good number of salads compare to similar kind of food joints. Main thing we liked are the deserts. Had 4 different choices of ice creams alongwith other items. In this area they are much ahead to others. Overall nice experience.

The grilled buffets are damn good and really loved it. The service was good so was the ambience of the place.

I Didn't had non-veg there so won't comment on that, but if you are looking for a good veg, better go for other options. Very poor service, less variety in veg starters and main course that too served after you have waited long enough to break your calm and argued with the staff. BBQ is far far better than this.

Located in the top floor of Mani Square mall this outlet is seving buffet meal. Compare to Sigree this joint of Speciality Restaurant is weak. The starters were good specially the fish item. In the main course there was less variation the Mutton Biriyani served was below average but the Jhinga Jalferezi was too good. In the dessert the assorted combination of continental with bengali sweets was commendable. Overall nice experience but chances was it could be better.

I have been to F&G South City plenty of times. So I decided it was  high time I give this outlet a shot and took my friend along. The kebabs and grills as starters were as usual succulent and filling..Mutton kebab, chicken kebabs, mushroom kebabs were simply delightful and went well with the mocktails I ordered...leaving little space for lunch. The lunch buffet was extensive as it was a Sunday and delectable too. Last but not the least desserts offered a plethora of options. I would recommend peeps to go there on weekends. :) happy gorging

Have been here once. Specially for the buffet service. At first I must tell the ambience is very classy. Service is quiet good even though they took off the Kababs from the grill before we even finished it. 
Now, about the food, at first the Kababs are delicious and cooked to its perfection. When it comes to the main dishes there were many i mostly liked the veg dishes. The various plates filled with various kind of Desserts was also great. 
I would say if your looking for a good buffet outlet this is one of them. Though its kind of expensive bt for the food its quiet worthy.

Good food.. Flame & grill is mainly famous for their kebabs.. Kebabs are not up to the mark.. Could have been better... Main course is good & deserts are average too..

Visited the place last week with my family,the atmosphere here was pleasant good seating arrangements nd spacy. Ambiance was upto to the mark,but wat disappointed me was the starters quality was not upto the mark.The kebabs were dry nd not tasty.The main course wasnt at all good,all the gravy items nearly tasted the same only the dessert part is worth mentioning the caramelised cake was good with different  flavours of ice cream.

The best grilling food destination after BBQ Nation. This place has a world class ambience.  flame & grill is a prominent name in buffet offerings.  The starters have succulent fish, prawn, mutton and chicken kebabs on the table griller.  I visit this place approximately twice a month. Kebabs = Yumm + F&G

This is a good place for buffet. We have been there several time & every time it's a great experience. 
PROS: 
1> Very good kabab buffet. Normally buffet joints either offers good startes or good main course but this place offers them both.
2> If you are in a group of 5+ & using credit/ debit card of a special bank then the offer 1free of cost in a group of 5. So basically you need to pay for 4,
3> Has a very ggod collection of deserts
4> Ambiance is good 

CONS:
1> Kabab offered as startes is average

With a wide variety of kababs and tandoors,this place is surely gonna be the biggest competetor of barbeque nation. I have been here for quite a few times now,and each and everytime,it mesmerizes me with its new addition in their menu. I would rate this more than barbeque nation in terms of their main course. It has a wide range of main course, and it also tastes very good. Not to miss the deserts out there.. Overall a very awsum place for family lunch and dinner...

Ambience: classy spacious
Reception: courteous
Price: for buffet reasonable
Food: its start with mouth watering kebabs through a variety of salads main course and finally ended up into a line of deserts...
Highly recommended

FLAME & GRILL - located @ mani square mall @ Em Bypass .. satisfies its customers 2 a very good level. love the ambience there... love there food .... be there kebabs.... (chicken, mutton,fish,prawns,aloo,bbycorn) soft, tender & fresh.... or there main course dishes... specialy there chicken biryani...which is just yumm... (never miss that if u r a non vegetarian). well m not fond of sweets AT ALL.. so no comments on the desert section they offer *though they offer great varieties to sweet tooths* ..... but all in all its a fab place for indian food lovers... specialy KEBAB LOVERS ... :-) ... 
the only CON about this place is the filthy ego problem of the waiters. they take there regular customers for granted and behave egoistic without any concern. 
Rest.... a Must Visit Place If U R Just Concentrating On good Food & Not caring enuf about there hospitality.

Flame and Grill is bound to be on the wishlist of any buffet lover. But if you have fuelled expectations, be prepared to return disappointed, especially considering the price.

I had visited the place with friends for a lunch buffet. The d√©cor and ambience was attractive but the staff, though not uncooperative, were slow. Coming to the food, this specialising as a grill joint had too few kebabs, a fish, a chicken and a mutton variety, which was a bore. The main course was a big NO, I cannot remember anything noteworthy to mention. The only positive was the dessert section which was gratifyingly stacked.

A decent place to dine, but definitely not worth the price and not a place to come back for more.

Well there isn't much difference in terms of food or ambiance if compared to other buffet only restaurants in kolkata. I would say it's a tad overpriced looking at the food items that are available. Liked the speed and quality of the service they don't pile you with unwanted kebabs till the point you can't eat rather they would ask you if you want more. Good variety of drinks available especially mocktails and cocktails. Starters were good main course was at least tasty though not much of a variety and the desserts were better. Good place to enjoy any occasion with family or friends though nothing too special.

We went for a buffet here.
They served so many items which makes one full by just tasting it in small quantities!
They served us kebabs and we made the greatest mistake there.
We went crazy and tasted 3+ pieces of each type of kebab (fish,chicken,mutton).
It means 9 pieces already in!
Thats it!
The main course and side dish and the yummy desserts couldn't fit in the stomach!!
Much regrets for that!

Stuff / Captain / Managers are very active, helpful, cooperative, professional and last but not least friendly also. They read your mind, understand and act like perfectly.

Food are awesome specially non veg & desert.

Veg items are OK- OK type.

Cleanliness & ambiance are good with simple decoration.

I am little bit disappointed with the size of prawns; as my perceptions was Jambo (GOLDA) but it not; anyway the Buffet was value for money & quite mouth watering and will force you to visit again with your near and dear ones.

There are so many best food pictures so, I don't bother to click & post.

As a buffet lover, I prefer Flame and Grill after Barbeque Nation. Located at the 4th floor of Mani Square, this restaurant is mostly famous for it's buffet. However, they do have the option for Ala Carte as well. The restaurant serves alcohol also (Not a bar). In the buffet section, they generally serve 5 type of starters in the table with the grilling barbeque coil beneath just like BBQ nation. (2 chicken,1 fish, 1 prawn, 1 mutton), and then you have to take the main course on your own from the designated area. The main course consists of assorted breads, rice, biriyani, mix veg, dal fry, chicken, fish, mutton, chutney. The main course is followed by a impressive series of desserts. You can have different flavour of mousse, pan cake, softies, gulab jamun, gajar halwa, choices of ice cream. Overall the quality, ambience, staffs behaviour is very nice. Definitely one of the best restaurants in north kolkata for a nice date, a reunion, and of course for them who live to eat!!

First of all, we enjoyed. Ambience was nice. Stuff behaviour was also cooperative. Comming to the food quality, Fish kebab was better than most. Chicken and mutton kebabs were nice. In main course, biriyani was different from normal restaurant or biriyani stalls. Desert was also nice. 674 was the price for week day lunch non-veg including all taxes. My suggestion is that mutton items could be better. That's all i can say from one time visit experience.

I have visited Flame & Grill a couple of times but it went from average to bad in due time.Last time I went for dinner buffet on weekeday with a team of 30 & we had informed & booked them a day earlier. The kind of service & the quality of food served was utterly dissppointing!!

The starters had crispy baby corn,2 types of chicken kebab & mutton seekh kebab,Fish kebab & prawn kebabs. The chiken tikka kebab had bones & was otherwise tasteless. The mutton seekh kebab was equivalent, it was extremenly dry & lacked the taste. The prawn kebabs was equally dissppointing. The Fish kebabs were well cooked & best in the starters section. We didnt order any veg starters but friends who did said they were enough dissppointing!! 

We rolled over to main course. The main course was elaborate with dal makhani,mixed veg, palak kumb, chole masala,paneer dish, a fish preparation,prawn tamatar, a chicekn prepartion & mutton biriyani,etc,etc.

The dal tadka was good & so was the palak kumb!! Rest of it was just dissppoiting. All the non-veg main-course, the prawn,the chicken & the fish was overloaded with curry leaves. All that came of those dishes was the smell & taste of curry leaves. The Fish again was the face saver,somehow it was eatable even with the dosage of curry leaves. The mutton biryani was good though & the mutton was apparently well cooked.¬† I am extremely fond of prawns but i too could not take a second serving of the prawn dish!! The non veg salad though was actually good to our surprise!!

The desert spread again was considerably better,comprising of mango srikand, 2 types of pastries, 2 types of assorted mousse, mug dal ka halwa, fresh fruits, 4 flavours of icecream with toppings of dry fruits,choco chips, etc.

The mango srikand was very good. Tasted just perfect!! The mousse was also good enough. The pastries didnt deserve a place their! Both of them were hard & didnot taste any good. The mug dal ka halwa was good,a bit extra sweet but halwa are a bit extreme on sweetness.The ice cream was standard.

The service was very poor!! Their was only 1 guy serving a team of 30 initially & then later another guy joined him who was in so much hurry that we had to force him to take our order for soft drinks!!! Their was shortage of spoons & ice cream bowls. And we were made to wait for them!! Their were no desert spoon available & on asking we were given soup spoons and that too after considerable wait. 

They really need to take a hard look both at service & quality of food.

I visited this place as part of a team lunch.
The d√©cor is excellent. Ambience - awesome!Food - there are plenty of dishes and I am sure you wouldn't be able to have everything at one go - I couldn't either.
However, the only thing that bothered me was their service - not that the staff were un-cooperative, but that their service was too slow.

Quite the conccept of on table grilling. I went to this place as part of my office team lunch. This was supposed to be my first visit in this brand.
The Ambience: quite small, but nicely done with the decor. The music was fine, variant. The AC was quite low.
The Hospitality: they were quite confident. One thing I didn't like was them manipulating the unfilled sections of the customer feedback form, which was a return from a customer. This was quite cheeky but not taken well.
The Money: Cost is fine here. Beware of the 27% VAT on liquor. If u carry a crowd along n have any ICICI card to pay...u get the eat 5 pay 4 offer.
The starters: Chicken 1, Mutton 1, Fish 1 item each. Fish finger was quite good, rest were ordinary.
The Main Course: Prawn - gravy was so-so. Sarson Fish - nice. Chicken - felt as if it was boiled and dipped in rezala gravy...not upto the mark. Mutton Biriyani - this can keep me coming back, aroma..taste well in short fabulastic. Lot other items which I didn't try. 
The Dessert: this is well rated by me as the ice-creams n mousse n cake n halwa n firni...all were really scintillating.
Overall experience: good for the price. lot of things needs improvement especially on the food standard.

I went to the restaurant yesterday with my team.I had heard many good reviews from many of my friends.Thought it would be a great experience,but it turned out to be awful.The place was crowded.It is running successfully just because of the name it has earned.Coming to the food.We had a buffet.The chicken kebabs were very finely roasted in the first go.But from the second round onwards it was raw.The mutton kebabs were tasty.Then the drinks arrived.The paneer lacked flavours.Mushrooms had a tangy taste but the sauce was not good.We were disappointed with the starters itself.The main course consisted of corn rice,plain rice,dal,paneer ki sabji,naan,ghosth biryani and murg salan.The food was cold and didn't satisfy our tastebuds.Overall the dining experience was not good.

I somehow felt that the taste of the food and desserts at the mani Square outlet of flame and grill was not as great as the South City Mall outlet.

One of the kebabs served to us at the table which I am guessing was the chicken tangri kabab was very hard, chewy and difficult swallow. The dhaniya murgh in the main course tasted very low in flavor and the chicken could have been marinated well before cooking. Basically it wasn‚Äôt a tasty dish.

The Gosht Biryani on the other hand was very good and the meat was extremely tender.

Also I noticed that the house music suddenly stopped playing after a while and never resumed playing again. Given a choice between the two Flame and Grill outlets I would any day choose South City Mall.

I wish I had given a ( 4 ) marks.
I didn't find them fabulous. 
Starter chicken was not that soft in comparison to the fish.
Less variations in the starter.
 Good ambience.
I had tried buffet only not ala carte.
Mutton dish in the main course was delicious. So it was good not great. But I will try one more time.

I went to Flame & Grill , Manis Square with my office friends on 01st may.We were a group of 6 and i had¬† a desire for long to have food at his pace. It was one of my friends birthday celebration and we zeroed upon this place. This is a all buffet restaurant and I had really one of the best eating experiences of my life.It was an elaborate spread....really elaborate with 6 veg starters & 5 non veg starters.We mainly had the non veg starters - 2 chicken, 1 fish, 1 prawn and 1 mutton items. The fish and the mutton items were really good-- soft and tender.What really helped us in having a lot of starters was the great offer of Unlimited Pepsi for Rs.25 per head.We did taste the veg starters but did not find them much to our liking and again reverted back to the non veg starters. What was really impressive was the service-- even before we could finish the sheeks infront of us, the next group of sheekhs were laid out. Really excellent service.As it often happens with everyone, we had so much starters that we had little space left for the main menu and deserts. The main¬† course had 4 non veg and 5 veg items along with roti/naan/laacha and steamed rice.. The Mutton biryani and the fish item were simply out of the world. Hardly any space was left for desert. Still i tried the mousse, brownee butter cake,fruit cake and fresh fruit. There were another 4 types of desert as well. All of these for a price of Rs.817 was really wonderful.The only thing that i didn't like was the additional service charge that they took which is another way of extracting tips that these restaurants have come up with. Overall a great experience and planning to visit their soon again

This is one of the best buffets in Kolkata, according to me. 
Situated on the top floor of Mani Square Mall, they've a very nice welcome and ambience.
The starters are so heavy that main course becomes too difficult to eat. But they're too delicious to leave. The empty sticks are taken off instantly.
The time you leave for getting the main meal, you'll find your table cleared. 
The main course has a lot of things but I should particularly talk about the desserts. 
A lot of desserts, you can use your own type of toppings.

A must visit.

I love their buffet, the starters especially. The prawn buffet is priced more as compared to the normal one but the prawn kebabs are out of the world. Totally! You will love their desserts too. The maincourse is a turn off though. Have always visited here for the starters.

Me and my sis dropped on my birthday for lunch. We went for the Non Veg buffet where the appetisers contained a fish item, a chicken item and mutton kebab. Unlimited appetisers,  so every time the skewers were emptied they were promptly refilled.  Service is top notch, servers are attentive yet they do not hover. They have a smile on their face which makes you feel good. We were so full that we went straight for the dessert.  Main course was biriyani, steamed rice, dal makhni, pa eer , chicken, two types of salad. Dessert had fresh fruit, almond mousse,hot gulab jamun, 4types of icecream- chocolate, mango, was what I had , along with choice of toppings. The only negative thing is that the vat on food +vat on alcohol+ service tax on total bill really inflates your bill so its not easy on your wallet. 
Lastly would likw to sign off by stating that the restaurant manager is attentive and even asked how the food was. Excellent experience and I would recommend this place to all foodies.

This is a nearby place on the 4th floor of Mani Square Mall. We went on a weekday for lunch. The buffet spread is pretty good though they served prawns only in the main course. There was chicken, mutton and fish for starters. The dessert spread was nothing special except for the icecream but the main course was adequate. Altogether value for money and an enjoyable experience

Tried the lunch buffet on a Saturday. Had a good experience. Had loads of kebab made of fish, prawn, chicken and lamb. Liked the prawn one most, was so satisfied and full  with the starters, really was left with a little room in my stomach. Though managed to taste gosth biryani and chef's special chicken recipe. Then came the dessert. All the items were amazing. Had ras malai, gulab jamun, swiss roll, cakes, strawberry mousse and ice cream - a bliss for the sweet tooth. This was the best part and I really enjoyed my meal there.

A standard buffet restaurant.
But we were really surprised that the number of kabab and tandoor items on the table were only reduced to three or four. Flame and Grill South city is certainly better or may be we were on the wrong day.
I really dont remember anything noteworthy to mention here with the food.
The dessert was also not good. I am surprised how two restaurant of the same franchise in the same city are so different.

My problem was i had tried both barbq bation n global grill before this, so it would b a comparative review. Ok. So went there with my gf on her birthday for dinner. Well the startes some of them(being non veg) was lip smacking. The chicken n mutton kebabs were simply amazing. This was my first experience with mutton to be honest and flame n grill were upto it. I would really want them to put a more effort into the veg starters. Starter wise it was pretty fine. Would rate barbq nation better than this. The starters was basically we could eat. Was almost full after the starters. The dal makhanai was pretty impressive ans the breads were also good. Did not like any other main course stuff. Desserts options were basic. Again barbq nation would a btr place for it. The people were kind enough. Had a soothing experience. Was expecting a bit more to be honest. But left with a family pack!!! ???.... Guess that wt matters the most. Wasnt a bad one.

One of the famous buffet dining outlets of speciality restaurant,this place has been serving delicious and lip-smacking kebabs and north indian cuisine for quite sometime..though when compared I would still prefer Barbeque Nations while opting for similar choices based on their sheer supremacy in service,starters and supreme desert spreads..Coming back to flame and grill they have a similar customised grill on each table,though half of the starters served don't need to be grilled..
In starters they serve mutton sheekh kebab, fish kalimirch, prawn kebab and chiken kebab..The fish starter was undoubtedly the best with strong flavours of pepper,a bit of sting..Surprisingly they were not ready to repeat the mutton and prawn dishes and on asking they provide the refill but after a loooong interval..definitely the service not expected in a speciality outlet..
However coming to the main course I feel probably they edge past Barbeque Nations on this aspect,definitely much well designed and each dish tasted unique and flavourfull..they had a Hyderabadi style Mutton Biriyani with a green texture and a mint flavour,quite unique..
Then a Curd Chicken preparation was there which complement well with the biriyani with its subtle flavours..
A Basa Fish ball preparation was there in tomato gravy which actually tasted nice,and a Prawn gravy cooked with south indian spices..
Then comes the desert section which was actually quite impressive,they had quite an elaborate spread of Malpua with Kheer, Strawberry Mousse, Pudding,Lemon Tart,Brownies and four Flavours of Assorted Ice cream..
Honestly each a item in the desert was prepared with supreme professionalism..I took several refill to my heart's content and actually over ate till I was loaded..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4/5

The starters, they completely kill your appetite with serving you loads of awesome starters ranging from paneer to prawn to chicken to mutton... After having starters you are so filled up that you hardly get to have much in the main course....

One of our colleague was going US. It was his turn to throw a team lunch. Usually due to convenience we frequently visit Bar-B-Que Nations. But this time we thought of trying something else. We came to know about this offer for ICICI card holders in this resturant, where there is a Buy 4-get 1 free offer. So 20 associates from our team visited this place for a Friday lunch.

If we compare the 660 buffet with bar-b-q's 748, the options for the starters are limited. 1chicken kebab, 1mutton sheekh kebab and 1 preparation of fish only. But all of the above preparations were really yummy. I can bet on this: The mutton sheekh kebabs were more tastier than that of bar-b-que. The fish kebab was tasty as well. There was no prawns in the starter menu though.
And then we started eating the main course. And believe me.. They are superior in every section. The mutton biryani needs a special mention. The prawn malaikari was hit among our team members. 
The dessert section has a lot of variety as well. There were 4 different types of ice creams. But I believe Malpuya with Rabri was the best of the lot.

Cons: The service is very slow, unlike bar-b-q nation. Another item in the starters section would have been good. But I think that is always there in dinner and on weekends.

So my verdict is, this place is highly recommended for a team get together. It is pocket friendly. Value for money. And you will get to eat: tasty starters, main course and desserts.

Visited thrice,and I was too satisfied with the food and the ambience. The kebabs are to die for. The Indian buffet is extensive , though I find it innovative. Filling up your plate with Biryani as well as fresh fruits is somewhat relaxing.
The hot gulab jamun,orgasmic.

Visited this restaurant Today, 24.4.2015.
The Lunch Buffet was at Rs. 661 per person(Non-Veg).
Good Ambiance, and the Staff was very well behaved as well, shrimps ran out thus, an attendant told me to take my seat, as soon as it arrived, he delivered it to my table in a small bowl. The decor inside was good and the restaurant wasn't much crowded either.
Its been long since I've been for a buffet so, I an my cousin decided to visit Haka but then changed our minds and visit this restaurant (it was his treat :D).
It has a Mutton kebab, chicken kebab and a Grilled Fish kebab in the starters, The mutton and Chicken prep was good but the Fish had its raw smell, even though it was well-cooked and tasted very well...The service was pretty fast, the empty sticks were taken away as soon as it was emptied and new ones were served.

Coming to the main course, there were 2 kinds of Chicken Salad which tasted satisfactory. The Biriyani was not what we get in Biriyani-special restaurants, being a buffet its was not so rich, the mutton in it was very well cooked and tasted delicious. Chicken Kassa was also good in taste but the chicken was hard a bit, so hands had to be used.*** Basa fish preparation was also good but I found a hair in it and I did not looked back at it again***. Shrimps was what we call "Chingri Macher Malai Curry" and I loved it, it was well cooked , the spices used had the accurate quantity and combination of flavours, with the essence of coconut milk and each flavour spurted out evenly, making it a memorable delicacy.¬†

Then there was the Dessert counter where they provided 4-5 kinds of ice cream which were good but had soften, they should have provided a service man for the ice cream as people were creating a mess, the ice cream got stuck in the spoon many a times, Mango and Chocolate mousse were very good has 4 of them , Malpoa was soft and warm and was fantastic , a red coloured sweet ( Long gulab jamun may be), a sweet made of bread which was good ¬†as well.There was an yoghurt (Kheer) which was deliciously sweet.. I did not look at the vegetarian side just tried out a small piece of mushroom.¬†

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I WILL POST MY HONEST REVIEWS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES AND WILL TRY TO NOT DISAPPOINT. BUT AGAIN, DIFFERENT PERSON HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES THUS, PLEASE READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION.

Another of those restaurants based on the buffet plus unlimited starter setup. With the kebabs and prawn and fish being roasted right in front of you. Food is just about average to be honest. I have had better experience w.r.t the food as well as the taste. The buffet options are quite a bit but again compromises on the taste. Alcohol is decently priced and definitely pretty taxing to the wallet. The ambiance is good, but not anything for which you would die for. Overall if you want you can definitely make a visit but even if you miss this place for any reason, you have not missed out on much.

Happy Munchin :)

A> starter - sheikh kebabs and fish kebabs are well enough but chicken, green chicken and prawn kebabs are low graded.
B> Main Course - Only prawn items are well tasted and one mutton gravy.. But pls don't go for any rice item and chicken items in main course section. Those are worst.
C> Dessert - customize it as u prefer, then u will love it

It's a great place to have a dinner or lunch.You will love it.There is no other better place than this from the price perspective as well.Better than many of those restaurants which charge higher than this but are unable to provide good food.
Just one feedback to flame and grill is to improve their ambiance a bit by having some kind of music in the background or Televisions.

I went to this outlet few days back with my friend. The ambience and decoration was ok to me, because nowadays we see a lot of creativity, and compared to that it was sort of normal. The staff was very friendly. The quality of the food was not so good as I heard. It can happen, we are human. We cant bring perfection everyday. The kebabs were pretty nice. We went for the buffet. We got a variety of kebabs starting from fish, chicken, mutton, prawn to chicken wings. The wings tasted very good and the mutton seekh kabab as well, and not to forget the unlimited pepsi for 25rs. What went wrong was the main course. The biriyani was not at all good. The main course was limited to biriyani, chicken curry (dont remember the name) and a prawn dish. The, desserts were disappointing as well, except the gulab jamun and vanilla scoop. So if you want to go to this place, aim for the kebabs. Hope this review was helpful.

I tried the non-veg buffet over there. The starters were great. Especially, the veg ones. The chicken was mediocre and the fish and mutton were very good. Then came the main course. Couldn't eat ¬†much as me and my fiancee were already filled up with the starters. The Biryani was good (not as good as you'd find in Aminia or Arsalan), the gravies were not great and the breads were not up to the mark. Deserts were quite good as they were mostly ice-creams and toppings. The unlimited Pepsi option was great. Go there for the starters. Don't keep much expectations from the main-course. The place is relatively pricey! The ambiance and service was good.

If you like buffets, if you like variety, and you like each item tasting amazing then this is definitely the place for you. Throughout the years I've become a regular customer of this place and for a good reason - it never disappoints. Food is always amazing except for maybe 2-3 items but that's because of personal preference. Service is also quick. Don't have to wait around doing nothing. They also make different types of naans if you ask them to, which is not on the menu. Price is a little expensive but it's definitely worth it if you like variety. The experience is even better if you are a non veg person since you can choose from twice the number of items at the same price. Overall would definitely recommend.

OMG can u imagine the chicken served was dry mutton had raw smell almost had to go to the washroom and puke..... Thanks guys for such a pathetic and downgraded food. Staff has to be called again and again for refilling of the kebabs. You get attention only if u are an bong and if u know how to speak bengali. Hats off am I in india the so called democratic country. I have been to barbecue nation and trust me it was 1000 times better. Don't know wat made me try this stupid place

Went there for Dinner buffet along with team.

Starters: mouthwatering,delicious. Specially the prawn starters. Had almost 6 sheekhs of prawn. Chicken starters could have been better had it been boneless.

Main course: hardly tried out anything due to starters. Still went on to try the chicken biriyani which was very ordinary.

Desserts: the thing which left me spellbound after the starters. Had so many items- hot gulab jamun(the small ones),cheese cake,mousse,custard,halwa,4 types of ice cream(vanilla,chocolate,mango and tooty fruity) served with choco chips,jelly,nuts,toppings. Out off all these best was the gulab jamun. They tasted so yummmmyyyy. The whole ice cream preparation was brilliant. Rest were also good.

Ambience: good but a bit space crunchy.

Went for a party with my office friends on last Friday for dinner. The ambience was good, though it was bit deserted, considering the general Friday night rush. The number of items as starters were gud - chicken wings, chicken, prawn, fish and mutton kebabs. But taste wise only chicken wings was a winner and the mutton was also as per expectation. But the somewhat greenish prawn was pathetic. Also the fish kebab was tasteless. On complaining about this, a different version of kebab was presented, whose outer coating was very hot but in the inner part, it was tasteless. In the main course, biriyani was good. Now comes the best part, the desserts. Lots of variety and all of them were really good.Special mention : caramel custard and the cheesecake. The free mocktail that accompanied the dinner buffet was very sweet. +0.5 for the courteous staffs

Was looking for a place to take my parents out for dinner, wanted it to be a fantastic experience for them. I picked up the phone and booked a table at Flame and Grill, and the rest is history. 
The kebabs they serve is out of thr world- too bad my mom is allergic to prawn, because that was the best of the lot-but they made amends with boneless chicken, chicken wings, mutton and fish variants. We were already almost full and bursting with kebabs when we decided to move on to the main course which, knowing people would be in a state similar to ours, was to the point, no- frills and yet very very tasty. Loved the non-veg salads and the fish preparation, and the Awadhi biryani was sans extra spices, yet delicious. 
It was time for desserts now and that in itself was a whole different chimichanga- they had pretty much everything from fruits to icecream with chocolate sauce to pour on it.
Overall, can't ask for more for the price they charge- it was one of the most value for money family dine-out I've probably ever had.

One of the famous kebab joints in Kolkata. It is famous for serving delicious kebabs. The kebabs might be the best ahead of barbecue nation. The non veg kebabs are all brilliantly prepared and just melt in the mouth. The veg starters pale in comparison though. The main course is well stocked but considering that people eat their hearts out during the starters it is less explored but the items which stand out - The BIRYANI. IT is one of the best prepared BIRYANI among the various BIRYANI famous restaurants in Kolkata. The salad was also delicious. The desert section contains a lot of items among which the Brownie is brilliant upon customization. Overall a great experience but the only consideration factor is the price. If the price doesn't matter then a great place to have a fantastic lunch /dinner /occasion celebration

I had been for the lunch buffet yesterday with 9 other people.

For Starters they had only 3 choices, which I feel is really less, as there should alteast be option of 5-6. As the price of the lunch buffet is more than that of Bar-b-q but the options are less.

The main course was good. The biriyani tasted really good, and there was descent options there.

The dessert also was good. Four ice-cream flavours was the best part.

The decor, and service is excellent.

I went with my friend to this place..i was very much excited to taste the buffet lunch.. First of all the starters were not so much in variety like barbeque nation.. But the chicken kababs and fish kababs were good.. Now coming to the main course dum mutton biriyani was too good and yummy and prawn recipe that is malaikari was tasty.. In the vegetarian section i liked the pulao, rice, green salad, paneer.raita taste was amazing.. But what i felt the hospitality management should be improved.. In some place barbeque nation stand ahead than flame and grill.. Soup should be added in menu.. Even fruit salad, deserts numbers should be increased.. Overall ambience was good and had a good day in the place.. I would rate 3.5 out of 5 for food and 3.9 for ambience and 3 for hospitality and courtesy

Very unhappy! Visited Manisquare Branch today with family! To start with, service was extremely slow. We kept waiting ( 20 minutes) after the first grilled batch was served. Prawns came very late - they were extremely¬† dry, hard, and completely tasteless. Just 2-3 small size prawns crumpled in a stick and for 4 people, just 2 sticks served. We had to ask at least three times to get the next round. When complained about the prawns, the staff said that perhaps it was "leftover" of the previous night which was served. He also said that this happens at times and soon came up with another two sets which were a bit better. Certainly a lot disappointing! Service is poor - very poor, quality is down and very little starters. Not again!

Visited last month. Good ambiance and service available here. On the buffet, the starters are great (especially for soft pieces of juicy chickens). But the fish kebab was not so good. If you like chicken then the starter is great for you.

In the main course there are different combinations for you, especially my suggestion is to try the Biriyani. And in the desserts, there are lots of combinations, especially for ice-cream that I like.

One best offer I liked that UNLIMITED PEPSI for Rs. 25/- only.

Disappointed with the Mocktail "Sigree Punch" which is nothing but Tropicana with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.

Starting with the lovely kebabs...oh what an experience it was! We tried all of them and believe me they were yum!! Unfortunately filled our stomachs with the starter to such an extent that we didn't dare to try the main course. However didn't miss the dessert part. They were heavenly! Though it wasn't a paisa-wasool eating-out, yet whatever we had gave us pure bliss! Next time I'm planning to cut short the starter portion, so that I don't miss out the excellent main course. :P

It was my fianc√©'s birthday last week and I had planned to give him a surprise. So after a lot of research, I pinned down my choices to Flame and Grill for its reknowned kebabs and the lunch buffet at reasonable prices. 
My fianc√© and I were overwhelmed by the kebabs, especially the chicken kebab. The fish haryali kebab was great too. We served ourselves well with the lip smacking all-you-can eat starters.
The main course started with salads, yoghurt and an array of veggies. Then we headed to the "do fulon ki chawal" (broccoli and cauliflower) and dal makhanni and mixed veg alongwith kashniri alu dam. There was naan and paneer butter masala that melted in our taste buds.
The non veg dishes started off with delicious bhetki, followed by methi prawn, chicken curry and mutton biriyani. Each and every dish was succumb, and not too spicy.
The quality and quantity was way over the mark.
The desserts were a delight with rosomalai, malpoa, gajar ka halua, mouss√® and ice cream with multiple toppings.
The ambience was top notch and the hospitality was warm. To top it all, they surprised us with a cute birthday cake.
We had the best birthday lunch till date. :)

When the restaurant had opened the quality of food was absolutely A -star! Somehow the graph has slightly gone down. However, the starters are really good... Delicious! The main course has a variety of different types of food, different cuisines, but I would like to mention the Biryani is yum!
On some days they have the ultra soft gulab jamun in the dessert section, and that, my friend is your lucky day! :-D
Free advice: go for the lunch buffet on a weekday, absolutely empty stomach, and just dig in!

Food- good, but not as great as Barbeque Nation

Ambience- Nice! No complaints!

Service- cordial! The staff is very patient, helpful and well behaved!

Overall I would say a nice experience, though there is a lack of privacy in case you want to spend a romantic time with your partner!

UPDATE: Quality of food and service has gone down drastically. Very disappointed with my last visit.

Had been there previously for team lunch, may be a year and half back, it was a good experience. But last time I went there with family few weeks ago, I had a really bad time there. If you are competing in the unlimited buffet region, you have to keep up the quality ¬†and variety of food. Only 3 kababs in lunch is not going to give you any business! Very limited food option and bad service made it awful. Try to avoid it, there are plenty of good options nearby this region.

Owned by Anjan Chatterjee of Mainland China fame, this is the mirror-version of Barbeque Nation. Unlimited Kababs are offered to you as long you call it a day. The kababs are tasty but seems a bit smaller in size (scaled down over time). I would suggest them to improve upon their desert menu.

This was the first time that I visited to any of the outlet of FLAME & GRILL. Starting with the Mani Square one was indeed a good idea I must say. At the first glance what attracted was the decor, with serene ambience. Tried the buffet (non-veg). They started with the starters (mutton balls, kababs- chicken and fish). Then was the buffet time. The quality of the food is pretty good. Experienced variety. Quite a lot of dishes (including various salad items, Pulao, mutton biriyani, chicken curry, prawns, rotis, makhni etc.,). What I, being a first time visitor liked was the desserts section with ice-creams toped with hot chocolate and choco chips, pudding. Those were yummy. Mostly pros. But just a con. Mutton curries should be introduced for the mutton lovers. Missed that. The overall experience was good @Rs. 660. Thank you :-)

Ambience is good a complete family type surroundings which include good food good price.
The variety in tikkas and kababs we get is more plus sea food main course items are limited but great additions now desert part is most attractive i feel the best deserts we get here more in variety 
My ratings 3.5  is due these three reasons which i consider a lack 
Firstly poor service waiters serve only after we repeated keep calling them.
Secondly tikkas and kabab do taste good but some of the seafood dishes and even veg starters are not that great and even the veg starters i believe are less then the non veg starters.
Thirdly, 5 to 6 are the main course dishes which include veg and non-veg more variety is needed.

Flame n grill is a very well known name among d foodies.. Finally I got a chance to visit the place.. Located at Mani Square the place offers an eye pleasing ambience.. We had the buffet lunch which included three varieties of kebabs: fish,chicken &mutton.. Then the main course had pulao,varieties of rotis,paneer,dal,vegetables, biriyani,fish,prawn n chicken... There were two types of mousse:kiwi n orange,cake,halwa,sweet,icecream in the dessert.. Overall I had a satisfactory time over there but the taste of food was not up to the mark.. The stuffs were well behaved.. So at the end the place had a nice impression :)

We had gone out for a dinner buffet at this place on a weekday. It was 748/- including tax - a little on the higher side in a city like Kolkata where food is worshipped like anything and you get tastiest of delicacies in the street food/local food joints. Was surprised to find the place more or less full when we entered the restaurant. We were welcomed well and I liked the ambience and the way the waiting staff showed us to our table. The buffet kicked off with the starters and then went on to the main course and eventually it was wrapped up with the desserts. Coming to the taste/quality of the food, it tasted bland - specially the starters. There were fish, prawns, chicken, mutton, paneer and aloo, nice spread! I particularly separated out the mutton seekh kebab which didn't have any salt in it and the tandoori fish was kinda sweet. Prawns were good but if a buffet is priced at 750/-, the expectations are going to be high too. Moving on to the main course, none of the items stood out apart from the mutton biryani and fish pudina curry. The prawns curry had very little pieces and inspite of telling them multiple times, we had a hard time finding good pieces. The desserts were alright. With this price, I expect a better taste than what it is now.

The only restaurant that with a slight improvement with give Barbecue Nation a run for their money...Have been there for 5 times now..starters will include a prawn kebab,a fish preparation tandoori type,mutton sheekh kebab generally,and two chicken dishes from the grill. The main course is quite elaborate. Generally chicken/mutton biriyani is there along with plenty of side dishes in fish , chicken and mutton. The salad zone provides great variety. However compared to the starters,the main dishes are a tag below in taste. Chicken and mutton in the main course appeared too much fibrous to me( if you know what I mean). Moving onto the dessert section, There is almost always a choco cake/pastry(the brownie I got was excellent), gulabjamun(hot but not the best I have had),fresh fruits which generally means watermelon only,a chef-special sandesh(I have tried it 5 times now but have never quite liked it),a fruit custard or payesh, ice-cream in 4 flavours with 3 types of sauce(the choco sauce is toooo good).Coming to the service,it is reasonably good.Though if you are going in large groups then you may have to wait between dishes.The waiters can try and make the service good by being a little more gracious.(they are not very welcoming or helpful).
The interiors are so-so.
Tne price in weekdays is quite reasonable but weekend dinners are a tag too high.There are no complimentary drinks.However ICICI card holders can Eat5Pay4. But confirm with the restaurant about the offer.
Overall its a good experience if you are a foodie and grill food lover.
Happy Eating.

i decided on 25th december,to enjoy my christmas special lunch in this place.. and to my surprise the menu was superb though little costly than usual days due to christmas festival.. it was 850rs inclusive of all vats . for buffet,. I and my friend choose non veg buffet,.. there were tandoori fish, two chicken items for starters and prawn also.. but since i am chicken lover i preferred chicken item, it was awesum .. grill right on table in centre.. unlimited buffet.. later the main course consisted of sarson ka saag and makai ki roti, winter special, followed with russian salads, papads, pickles, dal makhani, mixed vegetable, paneer masala, veg biryani,jeera rice, in non veg there was mutton biryani, chicken butter masala , one fish item was also there.. and fresh bread basket was being served right on the table with tandoori nan, tandoori roti... the food was very tasty each and every item was well cooked and prepared... later followed the desert section ..which excited me alot.. ate more than i thought of having.. yummyyyyyyyyy.... started with gajar ka halwa, hot served, then there were four flavours of ice cream, mango, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry .. one can decorate their ice cream with chocolate sauce, choco chips,nuts, so on, then there was dark chocolate truffle, mango mousse, blue berry cheese pastry, hot gulab jamuns, ... the buffet was excellent, worth spending there.. ate so much that i skipped my dinner hahaha... service was very good and tandoori butter nan was super soft and light.. which i liked the most. overall a very good experience.. would love to visit again.

At the very onset of the year..there comes a time when the ever hungry gastromaniacs turn and look around to feed on the unlimited delicacies on offer..we decided to close in on Flame&Grill in this new year..the place was jampacked and we had a waiting time of around 20 minutes for the lunch buffet..they took some time to clean and clear our tables which didnot go along too well..but after the spread began no complaints what so ever..we gorged on the tender mutton,chicken,prawn and fish kebabs..the hunger didn seem to die down there..the main course though was a turn off as they didnot live up to the expectations of the kebabs..but the dessert section comprising of blueberry cakes,chocolate truffle,gajar ka halwa,souffle and a bunch of icecream scoops were tasty enough to sign off another delightful buffet..will make more visits if the service gets better..

P.S- the absence of any complimentary drink should be taken note of..

Well, we, a group of 10 friends met at Mani Square, and decided to have lunch here. I am glad I did as it was on my wishlist. I am not sure if they have a la carte, but they do have a buffet spread. They serve the kebabs on the table top, where they remain warm. I loved these! Light and tasty, I could go on with some of these. One of our friends who had been there earlier had told us that their main course isn't too good, so we had more of the kebabs. She was right. Their desserts, however, were yummmm!! I am not much of a dessert eater, but I loved the spread here. They had both Indian and Western desserts (gulab jamun, halwa, as well as souffles, brownies, ice cream...). The waiters were very attentive and cordial. We were making a noise and dividing up the total amount (as we were going dutch) took us some time - they were very patient about it. It's a little expensive with the taxes so isn't a place one would go on a regular basis. But overall, a wonderful experience.

this is really the flame and grill, it was long pending on my list of visit, the food is basically for non veggies, for me a vegetarian, it was difficult, but my friends do non veg so we finally paid the visit.

The ambience was good and the the staff was very courteous, the aroma was enthrilling. Once we ordered the barbecue was hot and i loved the feel of it, my friend loved the food so did I, the buffet is pretty decent priced whereas ala carte might sound a lil stiff to many. Overall a very good Experience.

Went  to  this place today afternoon. Because of festive season till 4th Jan 2015 they unfairly charged Rs. 825 instead of the normal rate of Rs. 625. The food was not at all good. 
1.Had plain rice with 'lehsooni nimbu prawn curry' (whatever  may that mean). Tasted stale.
2. Had mutton biriyani. Poor quality. Again  stale. Left eating midway.
3. Starter kebabs were so so.
4. Saving grace was chocolate  icecream.
A big dissapointment.
Went there on 1/6/2015 again.
Stopped the waiter from putting in the annoying charcoal oven. Refused starters as they easily fill you up. Instead had main meal. The vegetable pulao was good. Plain rice was also nice. Had Pepper prwan curry which was just so so. All other items including mixed vegetable etc. etc. seemed to be made in haste and did not appear to be worth a try. Deserts were simply horrible. Icecream was bitter Mousse was tasteless. Amrut Firni was the worst of the lot! Disspointed again.

Visited - 18th Nov 2014, Tuesday

Location - Mani Square, EM Bypass, very easy to locate.

Ambiance - Real good, with proper lighting, correct temperature and atmosphere.

Food - ¬†Really satisfied with the quality of food served. Had ordered non veg buffet. The starters were lip smackingly good. Fish, chicken and mutton seekh kebab was served in huge quantity till you cant take in anymore. A special note for the awesome chicken kebab, it was one of the best i had, since it was cooked to perfection.

Now coming to main course (by that time we were really full). There were again different items like thai chicken, chicken rezala, gosht biriyani, bhetki gravy and prawn.

Now coming to the desserts there were real variety of spread before us. Chocolate mousse, bread pudding, gulab jamun, fruits, ice cream etc.

Overall the food quality was awesome, best being kebabs followed by chicken rezala.

Service - The staff was very courteous but i felt they could have been a bit faster, kebab service was slightly slow. But nothing to be complaining for!

This was the day when our Gynaecology unit gave us a treat here. Starters were pretty disappointing.everything was Hariyali..hariyali chicken..hariyali mushroom..hariyali fish.  Pineapple kabab was too bad. Main course was bland. desserts is the only reason of me giving it a score above 3. They were realy good. didnt visit the south city f&G yet.hope to have a better experience there. DISAPPOINTED.

Went there today, on Christmas. The kebabs were pretty good, although we got better quality at the South City branch during the Pujas. Service was good. The kebabs were for some reason a bit cold and needed to be put on the table grill longer than usually required.

As the mani square outlet of Flame & Grill is close to reach..from my home..so i opted this outlet for my sunday lunch.
Coming to the service!- Very friendly staff..
Pocket pinch - In your budget mostly..
Food- Overall good..
As Flame & Grill is known for their amazing buffet...i was surprise to see so many options of starters..just like Bq&n.
It was total a pleasing experiance to my taste buds..They have mutton,chicken,fish,prawn,paneer in there kababs...Yummmm...
In their main course i loved their steamed rice with mustared prawn curry..and lastly Flame & Grill can make you flate for their variety of desserts...amazing..Gajar ka halwa.

I have lost count how many times I have been to this place.. their buffet spread is almost same on weekdays.. so if you are a regular visitor, you prone to get bored with with their spread.. just as in my case!

In my last visit for a team lunch, the grill consisted of Kandhari Murgh Tikka, Machhli kalimirch and bhune jeere ka seekh kabab.. The chicken kabab was nice.. fish was soft and spicy.. Seekh kabab is always too spicy to my taste.. Ajwani Paneer Tikka, Pudina Malai Aloo were the ones from Veg grill.. Both were strictly okay.. The complimentary drink offered was the Blue Lagoon which is common yet appeared refreshing to me..   

Main course was pretty average on the whole.. where the Murg Salan tasted bland, the Konkani Jheenga Curry was a spicy with fresh prawns used.. Their Gosht Biryani is always good, either with eggs or without.. 

The dessert was good.. consisted of Malpua, Langcha, Mousse, Bread & Butter Pudding, Fresh Fruit, Ice-Cream with Condiments.. The mousse was nice and smooth.. malpua and langcha were heavily sweet.. the pudding was okay.

What really disappointed us is the Service. In a buffet restaurant, you really cannot afford a slow-paced service, where most of the people were not having any starter to eat because grills were left empty! I had already provided a heads-up to them regarding the same through mail, but it was not taken care of! There are more examples of bad service, like I was served water long after I had started eating, only after several reminders. The head waiters are in general un-courteous and I received the same feedback from all of the tables. The only exception I found in the last visit was the behavious of the head waiter.. he was extremely polite and fast but even that could not change the attitude of the whole serving team!

At a price of 567/- per head with corporate discount (eat 5 pay 4) this seems to be a fair deal, only if the items go through a changeover!

Good buffet but the starter options could have been better. They serve 1 chicken item, 1 mutton kabab and 1 fish kabab in the non-veg side. Veg counterpart comes  with aloo, paneer and dahi kabab along with crispy fried babycorn. The kababs were just okay, not too good nor too bad. The main course consists of salads, biriyani, chicken, prawn - I had none so can't really talk about their quality. Desserts were good - hot gulab jamun, halwa, mousse, pastry, ice cream with toppings, etc. Service is a bit on the slower side. Buffet price - Rs 660/-

This outlet of "Flame and Grill" is located on the 4th floor of Mani Square mall. I am kind of a regular visitor to flame and grill's south city outlet but once i crashed in to this outlet of mani square. The decor and ambience of this outlet has a grand and royal accent pretty similar to its other joint. As being a fan of their buffet offerings, i ordered the veg buffet here. As we know the succumbing journey of their mouth watering offerings started with delicious starters(paneer tikka, allu tikka, roasted tomatoes) directly from the grill fitted into your table. The starters over here are just so much addictively tasty that you get almost filled up before moving to your main course. The main course are spread on the table( pulao, steamed rice, shahi paneer, daal,etc;) from where you can take whatever and how much you want to treat yourself. Then follows the dessert(gulab jamun, rasgulla etc). Their bar is well stocked with classic wines and spirits- be it bourbon(jack daniels), imported wines(chardonay+syrah) etc. Their collection of single malts are quite impressive and one of the most sought after in town.  Well according to my experience i have never been dissapointed by either of the joints of "Flame & Grill" in town. Everytime i walked out burping with a bloated stomach and a smile on my face. This is the perfect place to cherish a complete fine dining experience with wide range of delicious offerings and their lucrative buffet offerings are very economical and can perfect for a budget meal for anyone.

I visited this restaurant with my wife a few weeks ago. It was not the first time for either of us, and when we were hungry after some shopping, we chose to visit this restaurant, as our experience of previous visits was good. Well, the nightmare started shortly after we visited.

Starters were ok at first, but noticed the prawn missing. I would never have thought that I need to ask for the items mentioned in the buffet menu, but i had to. Items were served with reluctance. Anyways, we decided to move to main course after we were done with starters.¬† 

I have no idea how they can even imagine that there will be appetites for karipata(I am not sure about the English name)-fled biriyani, if I can call that a biriyani. Some whitish chicken curry was also there, the chicken pieces had blood hidden in those, and how can I forget the taste, awful is a severe understatement!!! My wife chose to have vegetarian main course instead, but stopped instantly by the waiter in a very rude manner. 

By this time, we were frustrated enough to have some good taste in our mouth, but alas!!! when we went to the desserts section,¬† we only found that the ice cream and malpua is good enough to have, rest are, maybe these had their lovers, but again, awful!!!!

Also, I have a grave concern over the ambience of the restaurant. I like kids, everybody does. But, do you cherish being disturbed by the screaming kids every here and there while you are enjoying a much awaited romantic dinner with your loved one? I love to watch kids play in a playground, but when they turn the restaurant into their playground, and encouraged by their parents and the restaurant stuff, I cannot accept that. I pay for a decent privacy, and no way I can stand these nuisances.

Never going to visit this place again.

Been there on 31st October for corporate buffet. Starters are Kababs which were spicy and sufficiently cooked.
Had mouthfuls of kababs. 
In the main course I personally had Dum Biriyani, mutton kasha and a whole lot of ice cream.
Ambiance was nice and calm. Decoration was very good, with dim light.
By the way, Moong Dal ka halwa was not positive in my taste.

Else its good all the way and definitely recommended.

Chicken stick kabaab & mutton kabaab were the best.... Fish tikka, aloo tikki & paneer tikki was good too.... They don't want to serve the chicken stick kabaabs twice.... No complimentary drink is served with buffet if you are not a card holder of ICICI bank.... Mangopichka was awfull.... Blue lagoon was good though expensive but not upto the mark.... Main course was not at all good.... Biriyani was like pulao, chicken curry was like stoo, and all were veg items.... After the starters the best were the desserts.... Fully unsatisfied and disheartened.... Donot wish to visit again.... The worst Buffet ever had.... Barbie Q Nation, Haka, Tung Fong & Harveys are far far better than FLAME N GRILL....

I visited this place with my family for a buffet lunch. The ambience and decor of this branch appeared very average to my eyes. The starters included the range of kebabs from chicken to mutton, fish to paneer, were ample and tasty. The drink offered was the Blue Lagoon which is common yet appeared refreshing to me. The wide range of salads tasted good. The maincourse was average on the whole, where the Methi prawns happened to tickle my taste buds, whereas the mutton keema happened to be cooked in excessive oil. The veg pulao tasted better than the Dum chicken biriyani. The dessert was satiable comprising the icecream scoops, payes (chawal kheer), chocolate muffin and hot gulab jamun.

Desserts are good...

The name is enough to make somebody feel its intensity. The name bear a fame which describes it all. Went to this special place with a very special one on a very special date. Before getting inside, the smoke which was emerging out made my mouth watery. The thought of getting inside was making me crazy that i nearly held myself. We sat on a couples table. The moment i sat down, i began to wander when they will serve the kebabs. Just after 3-4 mins the table oven arrived & within a moment the kebabs arrived. I was overjoyed seeing those. The sooner it came we started to have it. It was really good. It taste good the chicken was soft. They served chicken kebab, mutton kati kebab & fish kebab on the starters. I nearly consumed nearly 21  pieces of chicken kebab 6 pieces of mutton kati kebab. & as because that was a special day with special some one i overestimated my capacity of consuming food and forgot to draw the line. Still i loved it. Well the starters were pretty good, in fact very good. But what demoralized me was the items in main course. I didn't liked those at all. No item was good. The fish item & the prawn was tasting very alike, though they claim they were different item. The biriyani was so-so. All the fame it incurred by all these years can be easily thrown away into the gutter by judging the quality of the main item. Anyways the desert was pretty good. Specially the langcha & malpoya. We finished all the items & was only satisfied by the kebabs & to some extent by the deserts. I meant to give rating 4 but the main course has deducted the marks. Well i am hoping to visit there soon expecting the main course would delight us.

Flame & Grill is the closest to my house serving buffet. The live grill on the table is pretty unique thing which they started. As far as the food is concerned, its pretty awesome . The mutton sheek kabab and the fish kebab are my favorite. The prawn is also good. The main course has also a lot to offer both and non-veg, including biriyani, chicken and mutton preparations. Then there are 4-5 desserts for satisfying your sweet tooth. But frankly speaking, as far as i'm concerned after having the delicious kebabs, there is hardly much space left for the other items.

Buffet is the speciality. Starters were fish chicken and paneer. Prawn was not available. The fish was delectable. The main course was ho-hum as usual with biriyani, fish, egg and prawn curries. Variety is quite less but taste is standard. Desserts were a bit more varied with some sweets, halwa, ice cream and pastries with fruits. 
Service is good- welcoming.¬†
The Bloody mary was nice enough- that was an extra I took .
Decor was interesting with tribal fusion style. Ambience was stylish and zestful.
Recommended for a better than average experience of only buffet style dining inside a Mall.

I have visited twice with my colleagues once in 2007 and other recently on panchami. Both the times i didnt like the food. The chicken kebabs were not fully cooked, muttom and fish kebabs were good. The complimentary drink was tasting like toothpaste. And the buffet items were below average. The price is acvording to the quality of food so no issues with price. Seriving kebabs or salads were very slow.

Was thinking about sigree global grill but came here because never tried it. Had a good experience but not like sigree. Served only 1 type of chicken kebab and it was not that great. Prawn kebab was nice. In the mains, biriyani is below average and the other non veg main were average, not that great. Coming to desserts, as a sunday lunch buffet there was not many choices. 
Service and managment is not good. Sometimes yoy may have to wait for kebabs, plates or others. I waited 10 min for chocolate sauce and 5 min for ice cream bowl.
After all, average experience. If you want, you can try once.
Thank you.

As you sit at your table you have an array of kebabs heaped on the grill , service staff make sure that there is never an empty plate in sight . The great thing with this place isthat they leave you spoilt for choice not only with the starters but also with the buffet dinner and an amazing desert counter. Awesome food in every respect quality , quantity and variety . Service staff were very attentive and had a pleasing nature .

What I liked:
a) The ambiance
b) Ample seating place
c) Deserts
d) Buffet price and discounts over ICICI cards
e) Location

What I did not like
a) Variety and quality. Only liked Chicken hariyali kabab which they served only once initially. And then after several requests they started serving it when our stomach was almost filled with other bad starters. May be this is their strategy
b) Almost uneatable main course dishes
c) Charging almost double for liqueurs compared to other restaurants. A daylight robbery.
d) Charges one plate of tasteless biriyani for Rs.400 for parcel. Again shameless robbery. Good quality biriyani are available in Kolkata in around Rs.150-200 max

I won't recommend this and will always prefer Bar-Be-Que Nation over it.

I went there some time back for an official lunch. We were about 20 people and we ¬†booked around 3 hours before our arrival to the restro. The restro is well furnished,I liked the look of it. We obviously went for the buffet and I was pretty excited since it was in my wishlist for a long time. But when the food came I was pretty ¬† ¬† ¬†disappointed as it was pretty bland in taste(with the exception of two or three dishes) ,the variety was very less and if you ask for a dish after it has been served once,they are pretty reluctant to serve it one more time. I just liked the desserts at the end,they were pretty good but other than that the starters and main course were pretty ordinary and not at par to a restro of this standard.

We went there for office team lunch party on Thursday. It was cheap compare to BBQ Nation or similar restaurants due to some ongoing offers on ICICI Bank credit card (like eat 5 and pay for 4 something like that!). In the starter there were one chicken, one mutton and one fish item and two veg items. There was no prawn which was disappointing. Also as a complimentary drink they provided only "Blue Lagoon" on that day. Main course was Ok which generally we do not care for in these kind of restaurants where we mainly come for starters :-)) Desert section had many options. Overall a decent experience!

As the name suggests..it's all about flame and grill..mouth watering kebabs both veg and non-veg..starting from chicken,fish prawn to paneer and other veg kebabs..simply awesome! Prices are a bit high but DO NOT give second thought while trying out the buffet..the main course vary from place to place and day to day.. but no compromise on taste. Salads do earn a special mention and as I have a special weakness about desserts so was floored seeing the variety of desserts they have in the platter...starting from gulab jamun, jalebi, rabri, different kinda fruits to ice cream of different flavors so that you always have an option of mix n match...enjoy eating to the fullest

It was a lunch party organized by our office for the whole team. The day was gloomy but not our spirits as we went to Mani Square with a great appetite. The starters were good, both the chicken tikka and fish tikka. In the main course there was Biryani, which was superb, then butter chicken, which tasted a little too tangy, then other items like pulao, dahi prawn, chicken salad, chef's special which was some dish with fish, all were great. Now, I have been to Barbeque Nation also and one thing I must say that the varieties of food in Flame & Grill was just perfect. Not too much, not too less. In Barbeque¬† Nation they keep too many dishes which makes it quite difficult to enjoy every item. But here I could savor all the dishes. But nothing can beat the service of Barbeque Nation, which I sensed was not that great here. The dessert section also had some great items like mousse, ice cream, gulab jamun, cake, watermelon etc, all were fantastic. I would definitely like to come here again.

They had Prawn, Chicken boneless and also bone, fish and mutton seekh kabab for starters.. The starters were excellent specially the mutton and fish.. Then in the main course they had ghost aur anda biriyani, nan in the side dish Mutton, Chicken, Fish and Prawn.. The prawn was just brilliant.. It was soft and awesome.. The biriyani was quite decent and also the chicken butter masala.. The deserts were good too... The gulab jamun, chocolate muffin was really great.. The ambience of this restaurant was really good..

Recently I had a visit to have a dinner at this well known place to attend a birthday party and am really enjoyed that bt I have to judge as a food lover.In this regard see my rating bt its all around performances such as decorum,staffs,style etc and they must get full marks.Now come to the point about food its good defiantly in their renowned kabab section which was covered by 5non veg & 5veg items.In veg section all items are good specially mushrooms are truly good. In non veg u can try their much hyped Mutton kabab bt it dosnt attract me as i didnt feel its taste was great but the prawns,chickens are fine.Now come to the main course for vegetarian their was steamed rice,pulao followed by dal makhani,paneer,alo-vendi fry,mix veg and I was surprised with their taste as it was the same as I had Radison Fort Raichak!!! Now at non veg it was Anda gost biriyani which still the show is really amazing.As a biriyani lover I believe it was awsome and very few  food joint can serve  such a great biriyani which was followed by chicken,vetki & prawn dishes and those are also good.In desserts their were various cakes bt their fruit custard and gulab jamoon in kheer was amazing. Roti, raita and salads were ok. Now the point is value for money ---- I think it is ideal for a corporate lunch or dinner and for the couples who r looking for romantic dinner with great innovation in their live  kabab  serving method wich also copied by some other points and at last Flame & Grill is good bt not great .

Really disappointed with Flame & Grill.  The kebabs were good,  but not great as in Barbecue Nation,  but the main course was average at best.  Some of the dishes were overcooked and the mutton in the byriani was tough. The desert item were better,  but the brownie strangely smelled of coconut oil.  Beats me why.  Definitely not coming back here.  :(

Decent enough interiors and good food. Been there for lunch buffet in a rainy afternoon. The starters included chicken tikka, mutton kebab, fish kebab and paneer tikka. It was good except for the paneer tikka but i really loved the mutton kebab. They served it with a green chutney and sauce. For refreshment we ordered the sigree punch which was quite good.



For main course we had chicken biriyani; Nargisi kopta, aloo palak and mutton as sides and for salad chicken, lamb and green salad. There was more items available like polao,Paneer, etc.



The desert included brownie, friut cake, payesh, fruits, 3 flavors of ice-cream with chocolate sauce,mango and strawberry syrup, nad my favorite hot gulab jamun. Oviously we coulnd't taste it all. 



All in all it was a good food experience and we went home fully satisfied.

The art of selling a variety of kebabs for 800 each has become old. It was a great hit when these restaurants came up, but time has moved on since then. But the restaurant lacks innovation. How long would you keep feeding 7-8 standard set of kebabs at such high price? They need to come up with newer ideas to sell. I never had main course at this place, so find paying 800 for the starters a little too much. May be they can have a tandoor only price. But whatever they are offering now is just so 2010-ish. You can come back after 5 years, and rest assured they will still be serving the same food.

Where do I start. Well yes it was a buffet. 9 types of kebabs of which 5 non veg including mutton different types of chicken kababs, prawn. In veg mushroom, paneer, aloo, vegetable kababs. Main course. Steamed rice., corn rice, biriyani, mutton fish, chicken dish, dal making, Paneer butter masala dahi vada, salads and more. Plus desserts... Big spread... That's a positive. How many you can actually enjoy from that line up is the challenge.

1. There was hair in my pudina chutney.. Didn't know hair is a new delicacy served up
2, there was a small fly on my dahi vara.. One that you see when dahi starts rotting
3. The mutton was old this hard and fibrous
4. Chicken to old fibrous hard
5. Biriyani was a pulao with biriyani essence you get in
markets. So the synthetic smell does wonders to kill appetite.
6. Prawn was not deveined... Seriously basic
7. Masala raw in veg kababs......

While ones pallette can perhaps be considered subjective, these are pure fundamentals.quality of ingredients makes a world of difference to the taste of food..plus also skill of chef to simply do magic with those ingredients..

I liked the mutton sheekh kababs, lasuni kabab. In the main course dal mskhni and rice... This is it in the whole spread.

Service good.. Waiters attentive and polite... Some saving grace...

Disappointing... To say the least..

Ive  been to this place a couple of times.....Every time they serves the best food....

I mostly tried the buffet here as i felt its better than alacarte.....As the name suggests it offers FLAME & GRILL.....
That simply means kabab.....I felt that's the best thing here....You get kababs of fish and chicken and of the veggies as starters.....and as the main course you get fried rice may be biriani, fish, chicken, and many other veg items...you can take my words that every food tastes equally good...and as desert you'll get ice cream of different flavors and really awesome brownie... 

To tell about the decor its a very nice place.....the decor is excellent and the ambiance is pretty peaceful too......You can have a really great time with your friends or family....I found that the people there are helpful too....

In my opinion if you are a Kabab fan its A MUST VISIT place for you...

People has rated this restau as 3.5, i guess in their mind, 3.5 is average... Guys this seems to be the best restau , but believe me dont try ever. Why the hell there is a bengali essence in everything .. I agree. that u had it up in Kolkata.. But it doesn't mean.. every dish you serve has a bengali essence. Apologies for being rude.. but its kind off truth.

This place resides at Mani Square Mall, in Em By pass, near maniktala main road, hence the best part is location. Well conncected to salt lake, as well as By pass. Went with a team of around 150 people, found the location very intresting, but the reason been is.. Just looks are well.. remaining all are average.

Pros :

- Nice Ambience
- Soothing Music played.
- Huge space, can easily allocate huge chunk of people.
- Not heavy to pockets.

Cons :
- Food is not as mark to the money paid.
- Waiters don't understand english ( not asking to be in well versed.), at least asking a glass of water should be understood.
- bengali essence on food.

People no offence to bengali cuisine, i am true lover of bengali, but when a punjabi or an afgani dish served, i feel it should have that essence in a minual form.

currently counted in one of those buffet restaurents where you can have the delicious kebabs unlimited. I visited this place  with office colleagues in a corporate get together. the inside decor, ambience are quite impressive. the stuffs are ok, but i can recollect that after serving 2-3 rounds of starters/ kababs, they were not equally approaching for those. we had to call them multiple times to serve the starters again. on the contrary, one of our colleague could not have lunch due to some ritual cause and went there just to accompany us. they served her complementary icecream as much she wanted. this type of hospitality obviously should bring them in notice.

regarding food, i found they do not have too many options. they just had 3 types of starters, in main course 3-4 types of sidedishes, in dessert 2-3 options. the kabas are good, properly grilled, but nothing special. main course was also nothing extra ordinary, fine to have. mutton dish was full of bones. it cost around rs 570-600 per person. so, as a whole it was a nice experience, nothing special...

Few days back I visited F&G for the team party, and this is my second visit. Ambience is  good, must say that. I was bit unsure what they will have in offering as I am mostly fish-eatarian(no meat) because last time if I remember correctly they had crabs which I don't relish much. But I was pleasantly this time. Along with normal course of chicken mutton they had delicious serving of boneless fish. They were soft and nice. But still I feel, they lack in variety of starter. 
In main course there were mustard prawns and they were good. Options were OK types.
In desert department they had dahi vada, brownies, cakes, mong ka halwa, ice cream, gulam jamun and few more. 
Overall it was fine experience. However felt bit suffocated in between because of the grills were there in every table. Probably they may work on ventilation.
There was a good offer going on with icici credit card(1 buffet free with 4) which we had opted.
Overall nice xp.

From the start, the service was good. Starter grills were good. Maincourse Chicken Dum Biriyani was Hyderabadi style. Mutton keema was so so. Prawn curry was really good. For the dessert, malpua was okish. Gulab Jamun was really bad. And there were ice creams.

Choice of a good meal at mani sqaure is very limited even though number of restaurants are quite high in number. Flame and Grill, without any doubt, stands out to be amongst the best. The courtsey of the staff is excellent, so is the food, especially the starters. To me kababs are the sole reason for going into any barbeque style restaurant. I liked the mutton sheek kabab a lot along with the prawn ones. In my last few occassions at the different outlets of Flame and Grill, I always had to ask for more prawn and mutton kabas. Over here, the servings were so quick and so large that we couldn't finish eating in time. We also ordered two fresh lime soda and two beers (carlsberg) but was dissapointed that Corona wasn't available. Unavailibility of items mentioned in the menu card, to me, is a shameful affair.

Items in main course were good but didn't do any justice to the starters. Kababs served at the begining had uplifted my taste buds to such a height that the biryanis and rotis seems like a mediocre preparation. The fish preparation was a complete let down - it doesn't even go with the rest of the items. For dessert, I went for ice cream and golab jamun. Both of them were good and satisfying. 

The bill for for 4 people came around 4500/-. We came out of the outlet happy and content. I will definitely go back to the place any day for a sumptous meal but will suggest the management to improve on the main course.

I went to this restaurant to celebrate my anniversary last year. The d√©cor is very posh with wooden dark colored tables and mood lighting. We were very excited as this was the first time I was visiting this restaurant. The starters were served in table. The taste and variety was not too great. The fish kebabs did not gel well with my taste palette. The chicken tikka was good. Grilled mushrooms were soggy and too small in size. The buffet was good with hydrabadi biriyani, mix veg, kaali daal, some standard chicken gravy dish etc. The taste again did not impress me much. There are much better options available in this mall. The comparison with ubiquitous barbecue nation also cannot be spared. There was an offer going on for free mock tail on ICICI card, but they did not inform us at the time of billing even when we have paid with ICICI card. So there was a little hassle over it. Over all I did not have a memorable experience.

The best place in Kolkatta for every glutton or to say foodie. Staff members are absolutely courteous. Table mannerisms are perfect from their side. kebabs as usual are unparalleled and mouth watering. A place where ur heart wants to visit every day health issues stops. Well priced nothing exorbitant in compare to the good food they serve. The Mani square one is 10 times better than the south city one. If someone has not gone there means u have missed one of the best amenities regarding food in Kolkatta. The main couse is good and have a great variety but I can't say anything about the taste as after the starters I never had and wished also to have space for the main course. The dessert section is mind blowing specially the hot Jalebis. Keep up the good work Mr Anjan Chatterjee and his team and thanks for giving such a place to us where we can lunch or dine to our hearts content.

Over priced and not worth it. I had been there a couple of times before, but the last time wasn't good at all. First of all the service was pathetic. It seemed as if the waiters were not interested in doing their jobs at all. Half of the time we had no staff to talk to. Im a huge fan of this grill style. But the starters were okay. The chicken was underdone. The fish and prawns were good. We were totally put off by this. By the main course was good. We liked the chicken biryani. The spread was good too. Even the desserts were. But all in all, oir experience wasn't good. 

Had the service been better I would've given it a better review!

Although not a great fan of Kebabs & Mughlai Dishes I had gone to FnG after hearing a lot from friends. We opted for the buffet. The staff were prompt & served well. Coming to the food, I was disapointed. The kebabs were tasteless & the prawn smelled of Dettol. The main course had very few options, but the corn polau, kofta curry & biryani were good. Dessert too had very few options & the available ones were not refilled. Overall did not like it at all. Would ythink twice before visiting again.

Had been there on 22nd sept 2013. Opted for Sunday buffet lunch. It was absolutely mesmerising. In starter they provided chicken kebabs, fish kebabs, mutton kebabs, prawn kebabs and paneer kebabs. All of these were too delicious. In main course they always provide stuffs like all other buffet giants. Desserts were too good consisting of pastries, brownie and fresh fruits added with Ice creams. Loved it.

This flame and grill outlet is located in the top floor of mani'S square mall along with the other restaurants.I had been here on quite a few ocassions but finally decided to write a review after having dinner over here a few nights back.Now the menu is usually at its best on sundays and luckily it was a sunday.The kebabs includes chicken tikka.,mutton boti kebabs.chicken reshmi kebabs n prawns as well.Now although the idea of unlimited kebabs is really fun the quality of the kebabs are not consistent.Some of them are overcooked or undercooked.Nevertheless i enjoyed myself as the kebabs kept coming.i mean like who thinks of quality when its unlimited.isnt it?especially when ur with your friends you do have fun.But the main course is a real disappointment.That night they had biriyani which was way too greasy and even had noodles and hot garlic chicken .I usually prefer skipping this part to move on to the desserts which are a delight(again when u realise that they are unlimited.i mean like seriously,unlimited ice cream?who dosnt want that?)that night they had brownies,mango mousse,fruits(which obviously i didn hav)and choice of ice cream.So if your looking for quality kebabs this is definitely not the place you want to be.But its definitely a nice place to visit with your friends especially considering the unlimited ice cream.would have given this place 3.but an extra 0.5 for the desserts.

I visited Flame & Grill quite a number of times and they have always delighted me with the food and service. "Awesome" is the one of the many superlative adjectives that comes to my mind when I think of describing the food. The kababs are delicious and so are the main course and the desserts. Also the service is quick  and still you can surely enjoy a leisurely lunch with your loved ones or your friends and sit for a long time having the buffet. The interiors are good and so is the ambiance.
Considering the range of buffet items, the price also seem reasonable.

I visited Flame N Grill last Friday with my friend to have our lunch. The ambience was quite nice. But I think playing music in background could have add an extra dimension. Other than this, there was too much noise because of so much crowd over there.

We went for a non-veg buffet. Starter was pretty good. There was around 4-5 different types of kabbab served hot on the table. In the main course we had biriyani,  polao, chicken, prawn, paneer. May be items were less but preparation was really yummy. In dessert we had rosgulla, gulab jamun, ice cream, fruit salad and other varities.

We also ordered strawberry shake separately. Which was good.

Service was really good.

Cost was more than average. For two of us it was 1500 including tax.

Overall we enjoyed our dish.

I recently visited the famed 'Flame & Grill' restaurant along with my friends & colleagues. This was actually my second visit to this place, albeit after a long time. We decided on this place after long arguments, and finally its prime location over EM bypass won it over other options.¬†
Nicely decorated well lit restaurant. We had already booked a table for 11 of us over phone. When we entered, although it was crowded, we were immediately ushered to our big table. It was actually 2 tables joined side by side. Seats were comfortable and ample space was there in the tables for all of us. As each table had only one grill counter, we had to adjust to only 2 grill counters overall for all of us. Important note - they do not have a toilet of their own. customers have to leave the restaurant & go downstairs to use the common toilet of the floor of Mani Square.¬†
First thing that we observed that they do NOT provide any welcome drink along with their buffet package, like other buffet centers. Anything you want has to be bought extra. We ordered for some alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages. Their menu card contained a huge list of beverages including mocktails & cocktails. But sadly most of the beers we ordered were not available. They only had Carlsberg & Kingfisher Ultra, so we settled for Carlsberg. Some of us ordered scotch whiskeys & vodkas which were served immediately along with ice.¬†
Now comes the food part. Starters are always the prime attractions of places like this. And they didn't disappoint in this matter. Prawn kebab, chicken sheekh kebab, mutton kebab, chicken tengri kebab, fish kebabs were served one after another. Special mention of prawn & fish kebabs, they were just amazing, melted in my mouth. I'm personally not a big fan of prawns, but that day those soft, juicy prawn kebabs just melted in my mouth. Although the chicken kebabs were not that good, they were not that soft. But the disappointments were the veg starters. 2 of our friends were vegetarians, who were very disappointed with the starters. Very few options were there - only mixed veg kebab, veg cutlet/chop, paneer kebabs, mushroom kebabs & small roasted pieces of potatoes. There was no baby corn which everyone expected. Tastes were average, nothing extraordinary. Also the veg starters were served only to veggies.....non-veggies were not served any veg items. This is definitely in stark contrast to other restaurants where non-veggies are served both veg & non-veg starters!¬†

After long time with the starters, we decided that its time for the main-course. Now main-course was very average. Very few items were there. No soups. Chicken biriyani/white rice, dal makhani, mixed veg, butter paneer, mutton kosha, chicken curry, sarsho fish, 2 veg salads & 2 non-veg salads including Russian salad & raita. Biriyani was average as were the vegetables & non-veg curries. Fish was actualy stale, left a bad taste in our mouth. But the dal makhani was excellent. Russian salad was good, but the other salads were not upto the mark. Raita was very disappointing.¬†
Time for desserts. This is something I eagerly wait for in every buffet menu, and flame & grill did not disappoint me here. Starting with mouthwatering hot gulab jamuns, jalebis, assorted mixed fruits, strawberry jam cheesecake and 3 favors of ice-creams. Each and every item were excellent. The cheesecake actually melted in my mouth. And the combination of hot gulab jamun & jalebi with vanilla ice-creams was just wow!! Definitely they ended the buffet with a bang!!!!¬†
Service was excellent. They continued to serve items till we said no. Always were very attentive. Took some group pictures of us. Whenever we asked for any specific item, they brought it without delay. They even helped us put on a prank on one our friends.....they were very convincing in it.......¬†
Now the biggest letdown were the costs. We went for weekend lunch which cost 675/- per head without taxes. Our total bill including alcohols were 15000/-!!! They have very high taxes & service charges, also the alcohols were very costly. Very very pricey indeed......¬†
When you compare Flame & Grill with other similar restaurants like Barbeque Nation, it simply falls flat! Flame & Grill is much costlier, less variety of food items, bad veg starters, disappointing main course & non-serving of veg starters to non-veggies. So although we thoroughly enjoyed our time there, the big pinch out of our pockets meant next we probably will visit other restaurants rather than this one....
In my opinion:¬†
Food quality - 4/5 for starters, 2.5/5 main courses, 5/5 desserts¬†
Decor - 4/5¬†
Service - 5/5 Excellent¬†
Value for money - 3/5¬†
Overall - 3.5/5¬†
Worth a visit........

We visited on 15 March 2014, much to our dissapointment.
We were served 5 veg starters- TANDOORI ALOO, PANEER, CRISPY BABY CORN, MUSHROOM & ROASTED PAPAD.... ( EXCEPT CORN OTHER ITEMS WERE WACK!)
5 non veg starters- CHILLY SHRIMPS( They served 1 nce only and was too spicy)
ROASTED CHICKEN LEG PC(it was ok)
MUTTON SHEEK KABAB - Served only when we insisted that we have got only 4 starters and was good to taste.
CHICKEN Tikka kebab-spicy a bit and oil dropping
Fish GRILLED- not xtra ordinary.
Now, comes main course:
BIRIYANI(MUTTON)- NO TRACES OF MUTTON AT 1ST SIGHT, REFILLED AFTER POINTING OUT THE SAME TO THE WAITERS.... PCS WERE STALE AND COLD.
MUTTON KORMA GRAVY- MUTTON KEBABS SERVED AT STARTERS DIPPED IN GRAVY... WHAT THE HELL!
FISH CURRY- GRILLED FISH CHUNKS IN GRAVY!
CHICKEN GRAVY ITEM-- GOOD TASTE 
CHICKEN MAYONEESE SALAD- GOOD TASTE.
Now, Deserts-
gulab jamun, jalebi, orange cake(stale n unfresh), cut fruits, dahi vada( good in taste), ice cream consisting of 4 flavours like vanilla,chocolate, truity fruity and strawberry.
NO MOCKTAILS/WELCOME DRINKS LIKE BAR BE QUE NATION.... FOOD ARE PATHETIC EXCEPT DAHI VADA, CHICKEN GRAVY AND MUTTON SHEEK KABAB.
Barbeque nation costs rs 742/- weekend dinner & FLAME N GRILL cost rs 747/- weekend dinner
So, why spend rs 5 extra and eat such nonsense?
plz visit bar be que nation instead.

Lots of good reviews!!! so I don't know may be that was my adversity as my experience was not good with this place.
I think ambiance is great, service is also good but food is unsatisfactory. Now there are lots of restaurants in the city which have been proclaimed as specialist about grilled-foods. "Flame and Grill" is one of the famous name in that list but they are not good enough to ride up and make place in the leader-board. 
As it is quite expensive, when foodies visit there they might expect some exceptions, some distinct food which make them believe that this place is worthy enough to spend such hefty green-backs, that x-factor is missing there.
Desserts are not good enough and very limited options.
Though there are lots of reviews in zomato where this place's character is glorified but I don't want to visit this place again.

ambiance : 3.5/5
service : 3.5/5

Flame and Grill,located at 4th floor of the Mani Square Mall. 

Wonderful!!

Recently I visited this place with a bunch of my friends. It was a friend's birthday treat. We really had a treat to remember. God Bless Him. lol :D

First of all we were asked whether we would like to have the meal with prawn or without prawn. Coincidentally we all chose without prawn :P
They offer buffets. We chose non veg buffet. Now the best part of the buffet was the starters any day. It was the kebabs- chicken,mutton,paneer,aloo,fish..  And the kebabs were unlimited :D The kebabs were grilled infront of you. It really felt like "Grill" mentioned in the name :)

The chicken salad was also quite tasty. I liked all the kebabs. But somehow I felt they would do something to develop their fish kebabs as they were not upto the mark. The mutton kabab was also spicy and succulent. The servers kept on asking for refilling the kebabs. After making our stomach and hearts full of kebabs , we decided to take a break for around 15 minutes to start for the main course.

By the time you go to taste the main course you are filled with the kebabs !! So the main course obviously looked a bit overshadowed by the special kebabs. There was biryani,jeera rice,paneer,dal,chicken,mutton and a fish item as well.
They tasted good but nothing extraordinary to me(maybe I was biased by the kebabs).
But another striking feature of the buffet was the desserts which comprised of lengchas,jilipis,choco brownies,custardand ICE CREAMS(tutty frutty,chocolate,vanilla and strawberry).
The custard tasted very very sweet and the collection of ice creams really made everyone of us happy.

Overall we had a very very nice time there.
Just a note to F&G people, guys plz improve your fish kebabs, so that in the next review I give you guys a 5 pointer :D

A must recommended.Enjoy :)

I have tried the buffet(with prawns) is awsum. If you are a lover of starters you will love it. The prawn starters, the chicken starters, the fish starters, the panner starters all are my favourite. But as I am a prawn lover i prefer the prawn starter. The way of serving the starters is innovative.

As usual, this branch also lives upto the flame and grill restaurant reputation. The spread is delicious with the kebabs and the biriyanis and the rogan joshs and the paneer butter masalas. The desserts are also the same gulab jamuns and the ice creams and the various cakes or mithais. What is special about this is that it is close to people living in salt lake and the food is exactly the same as its other main branch. I have visited this place many a time and I have enjoyed it thoroughly and I suggest that you do the same. Happy eating.

My bf loved the mutton shammi kebab.. The biriyani was light non greasy n tasty.. We had so much kebabs that we were full, had little of the maincourse i.e. Biriyani, chicken kalimirch n paneer masala.. The food was excellent, music n ambience soothing and we had a good time..

I am not a fan of buffet in general, but a few days ago, I had to attend a meet up at this place, and since it was near my place, I was happy to land up here. There were six of us, and apart from me, every one else were prawn eaters. They wanted the buffet with prawn, I was all for without it. Got a number of kababs... fish, chicken and vegetables started to come to our table, and they were placed on the grills, and we started our meal. The chicken kabab was very good, soft and moist. On the other hand the fish one was a bit too salty for my taste - and I stayed out of it. I love the concept of chunks of meat being grilled in front of me, which was good... soft chunks of chicken grilled to perfection... I kept mine on a bit longer on the grill to make it slightly more than necessary.

There were a number of things in the main course - a light pulao, chicken, vegetable dishes, and a few desserts. I was not a fan of the desserts - they were unremarkable. However, there was a lovely chicken gravy which I liked. My friends who had the prawns were all for it - praised it to the skies.

Went for dinner. Quality gone down like anything.  I remember visiting this place almost a year back it was not so bad.
The kebabs were taste less, almost same flavour for chicken ,panner and prawns, too much spicy, veg kebabs took 15 mins to serve. 
Very pathetic experience will never return.

Been here on Saturday afternoon for celebrating anniversary with spouse. All the starters are very good. My favorite was prawn kebab. Service was prompt. They have wide selection of drinks too. In the main course they have very less dishes as option. But bigger variety is there for desserts. However, taste wise and interior decor/ambiance it is falling behind its closest competitor Barbeque Nation.

I have visited this place with my office friends. This place is situated in good location .I like the area and  crowd was also good.Luckily at that time they were giving offer on icici card for 5 people you have to pay for 4 only. 
They offer buffet system only. In the non veg they have option to choose with prawn and without prawn.
 No such option avialble in veg buffet.I have taken veg option.I like the ambiance and live grill concept. I like my kebabs a little burn so intialy it give crunch and than melt in  your mouth. so i ask to put some more charcol on our table.So ambience part i will rate 4 out of 5.Now comes the food part. No soup option.Quality of kebabs is average and not uniform. In some of the Kebabs sticks Paneer was not fresh and option are also very less. They have only 5 option in veg menu and they server corn starter in last which if you ask these for 2nd time quality will be not be the same . main course part was difficult to handle as will as t  to judge after gulping do much of starter. So we take little from that part. they an offer some more type of bread in their main course option. 
In the desert section they i like the melting gulabjamun ,kheer and brownie part. jalabi was disappointing as they was very cold.So for  food part i will rate 3.5 out of 5.
Service was quick but they was lacking as compared to other restaurant in this type like BBQ. They were lacking in human touch , on which they can work on.

so over all it was a good experience. can give a try ... I will rate overall 3.5 out of 5

A few days back I visited this place for lunch with six of my friends.We were six hungry foodies looking for a restaurant that offered a good buffet to indulge in.Since this is located very conveniently at Mani Square mall and also because previously I had had a very satisfying experience at the South city branch of Flame & Grill,we decided upon this.And it sure was a great choice!! We were impressed more than before.

This place offers only buffet meals.We opted for the non veg buffet.There were 2 options-buffet with or without prawns.Being people on budget,we decided upon the buffet without the prawns which was priced at around Rs 620.The buffet with prawns was priced at around Rs 700.

The buffet starts with the best part itself - the kebabs!!! There were chicken,fish and mutton kebabs.The kebabs were not only unlimited but they were really really good.They were nice and succulent.The chicken kebab was especially good.The fish kebab was a slight let down.To add to this,a personal grill at your table is just wonderful.The waiters will serve you the kebabs for as long as you ask them to and till you take up your buffet plates for the main course.Unlimited tasty kebabs with a personal grill.I mean what more can one ask for!!

Coming to the main course,honestly,it struggles to keep up to the quality of the kebabs.But then I feel since your tummy will surely be more than half full courtesy the kebabs by the time you take up the main course,it is slightly difficult to judge the quality of the main course properly.The spread though is excellent.It consisted of Biryani,another rice preparation,jeera rice,a couple of veg items,one chicken,one fish and one mutton item.Here again,I felt the fish item was a bit of a let down.

Next came the desserts.Again the options and the variety was excellent.There were gulab jamuns,jalebis,chocolate brownies,payesh,mousse and ice creams of 4 flavours-vanilla,chocolate,butter scotch and stawberry.The quality of the desserts were really good.I really liked the gulab jamun and the brownie.Once again these desserts which were really good,were unlimited!!!!!!! 

We sat and we chatted and we ate to our hearts content!!! Overall we had a sumptuous meal and at that price!!!! It was absolute value for money.And we the hungry foodies literally turned it into a bargain!!!! 

Apart from the food,the ambience and decor is nice.The interior is quite spacious and comfortable.The service is decent.The staff are well trained and very courteous.

The few negatives about the place that I feel can be looked into are-
1.There is no a la carte option.Buffet may not be suitable or preferable for everyone even though they offer a great buffet spread.
2.The main course items can be improved and specially the fish items.

All in all if you are looking for a restaurant offering a good buffet then this is the place for you.
Stick more to the kebabs and the desserts.
Do enjoy and pamper yourself and your tummies...!!! 
Cheers!!! :)

Service is the only thing thats nice. Food was extreemly substandard. Prawns should have been called SALT EXCESS, i nearly puked. Fish was SALTY too. Chicken was undercooked and dripping with oil. The chicken salad was also salty. Lamb kebabs were dry. Biriyani had too much rosewater. The fruits they were serving seemed as if they had been cut three days ago. Even the cucumbers were dry. The selection of deserts were sad- id serve better deserts to my guests at home. Kheer was runny, needed more density, flavour and sweetness. Langcha and orange cake(but who serves ORANGE CAKE?) were decent enough, but i get that at my local market. Wouldnt pay that seven hundred and something per plate for this kind of food. You want unlimited kebabs? Go to Barbeque Nation, definitely not this place. However again, their service was good and so were their jelebis, their only reediming point.

Unlimited kebabs with your own personal grill !!!!!!!!! 

Located at two very convenient locations, the restaurant is big, spacious and pretty comfortable, as is any speciality group venture. Staff are warm and service is pretty fast unless its a weekend dinner when your kebabs take a bit longer to reach the grill.. 

Why F & G
1) I like my kebabs extra grilled and super hot. So i order my sigree to have extra charcoal and grill it like crazy before having it.
2) I like to have kebabs like crazy without worrying of my billl , even skipping my main course !!!!!
3) Main course is ok after your tummy is loaded with the kebabs.

Why not
1) I feel the kebab experience is always incomplete without a seekh kebab
2) The taste of kebabs is not the best i would say !! but the live grill makes it up for me !!!!!!!!!
3) If you are craving for  a very sumptuous main course experience, i would suggest you to avoid the place.
4) No soup, deserts are ok.
5) They serve some crispy fried babycorn or ladyfingers in starters beside the live grill which is a touch oily and i find their taste ok.

The place is great for big time kebabeterians like me who want to grill their kebab to their own satisfactions !!! Otherwise, its average for that price.

Very good buffet spread, in my honest opinion, their mains are much better than bbq nation's buffet, but, though the starters are pretty good, but not as excellent as their major competitor. In desserts selection, they still are behind bbq nations, not in number of desserts offered or variations, but, in taste and quality (please don't misunderstand me, they serve very tasty desserts, one with sweet tooth should be craved for, but, the other one serves similar with a taste to die for). In terms of ambience and ease of access and parking, they are much ahead than their competitor, so, overall, they both get the same marks. Oh, btw, I just missed the spicy juicy grilled soft shell crabs last few times, when I've visited them, I don't know if somebody have already informed them what do they loose by omitting this, they were probably the best crab starter in Kolkata (oh yes, definitely  just after devilled crab in Mocambo, but, come on, Mocambo can never be anybody's competitor, they are heritage, we should only keep them as textbook of taste and as reference).

Few Months Back Me & My Fiance Went For Buffet Lunch (Without Prawn As She Is Alergic) In A Weekday
When I Entered There They Asked Many Questions What We Want To Get & All
I Thought They Must Be Hotel Management Plus Human Resource People That Is Why Want To Ask My Wish & Will Surely Make My Day
Then The 1St Lot Of Kebabs Came,
Those Were Tasty
Then We Finished It & Ordered For More
Then After 20/22 Minutes Our Luck Favoured Us & Got 2 Sticks In Total
I Think After Every Order They Call The Vendor For The Raw Materials To Serve Us Fresh

Anyway,
Although We Went There For Kebabs But, We Did Not Have That Much Time To Eat Fresh Material Everytime

Then,
We Went For The Main Course As 3 Sticks Of Pea Sized Kebabs Is Not Enough For Us As Lunch

In The Main Course,
Choice Was Limited
Biriyani Was Good Although It Was Vegetable Biriyani
Chicken & Mutton Preparation Were Oil Mine
Next We Went For The Desserts & Again I Found That They Are So Much Innovative & Concerned About Our Health That Forgot To Add Any Kind Of Sweetner When Preparing

The Day Was Spoiled

In Short,
Please Stop Applying Low Grade Catering Strategy When You Are Advertising For Buffets As Everybody Can Not Go For Oily Main Course

I have visited Flame & Grill, Mani Square outlet and here's my experience - 
The restaurant is well decorated at the first glance, staff was good and the manager was roaming around to make sure that everything is alright. Opted for Non-veg buffet and was served with Fish, Chicken, Mutton and Prawn Kebabs. The waiter kept on asking weather to bring more and more, they will keep serving you kebab until you start getting your buffet dishes. 

So talking about the food, it was hot and fresh. There are a lot of veg and non veg options and ample of sweet dishes. The only concern would be that breads such Naans are served too late. Since that day there was no naan offered in the buffet menu, I ordered them separately but they were brought after my family members nearly finished their food (they did not order naan).

Flame and Grill -- I visited the outlet at Mani Sq, EM Bye Pass. Was lucky that they were running an offer where if you are 5, you have to pay only for 4. Thumbs up for this!

Ambiance was good and the staff was welcoming. We settled with a drink and had signed up for the non veg buffet with prawns - yes they have an option of either including prawns for a higher price or excluding it (Strange! but the prawns were worth it)

Starters were good, and a special mention for the juicy prawns whose juicy taste would linger for days to come. Chicken tandoori was above average, and mutton kebabs were just about average. The fish kebabs were tasty. In the main course, lamb dum biryani clearly wins the show. So much so that I had to get up for a second helping!
Just when you think that you are full with all the great food, comes the icing on the cake, and quite literally! With cheese cake sort of a preparation, gulab jamun, ice cream, it was all mesmerizing. Pricing justifies the food and hence my rating of a 4.5! Will visit it again whenever I get a chance.

Positives :
1. Ambiance - Good
2.Waiters - friendly and humble
3.Food(whatever was served) - excellent

Negatives -
1. No drinks served. Last time i visited Flame and Grill at South City mall, distinctly remember being served a drink. Here reason given, no drinks served during dinner.
2. Selection of salad was good. But not upto standards.
3. Veg starters took too long to be served.
4.No soup. Imagine our agony when we went to get soup with kebabs and found non. I mean cummon everyone serving such buffet serves soup.
5. Ordered a roti. Got in after 20mins.

Overall okayish experience.

Flame and Grill...a warm welcome from the attendants gives you special treatment which you will find rarely in any restaurant...the people here serve you even in the buffet...I would love to mention their hospitality...to start with...we had Fish Kabab, Chicken Kabab and Mutton Kabab...all in a row...and all in their best form...tasty and smoky...later on I had Chicken Dum Biriyani, Lamb Stew, Two preparations of Chicken with at least 3 kinds of vegetarian curry...I liked Sprout Salad of which more than the 3 varieties they served...Gulab Jamun, Pancakes, Icecream were on my list of desserts...altogether a good experience...but somewhere I personally felt that they are more inclined to chicken preparations...ambiance was extravagant...sitting arrangement accommodate ranges of groups...good food, good place and good people to spend time with spicy, meaty Indian delicacies.

Visited this place with my girlfriend and both of us loved this place, the atmosphere, food, and their services. We had their lunch buffet which was exceptionally good and their grilled kebabs were heavenly. Though back in my mind I was comparing this place with Barbeque Nation and was a bit disappointed with the starter options they serve here. But overall, I'm happy with their services and the way they behave with their customers. I will definitely visit this place once again, and will recommend to you as well.

I had been there last weekend. Firstly i would say that the ambiance was awesome. Their style of having the sigris on the table is really awesome.
Now coming to the food. The kebabs were just too good. Though i will say that the chicken tikka kebab was not that good that you would expect in a place like this. But the Fish kebab stole the show. It was really like butter and seriously i didnt have to chew it, it just melted in my mouth. Also the mutton boti kebab was wonderful, and i was really asking for more.
Now coming to the main course. Frankly it was average. The chicken butter masala was not good at all. But the Fish was wonderful and also the Gosht was very well cooked. The chicken Dum Biriyani was tasty , not very rich but good. Though the chicken in that biriyani was not at all tasty. It was tasteless.
Desserts was awesome since there was a lot of variety to it. It had fruit brownie custard, Fresh fruits, Rice payesh, Jalebi, Hot Gulab Jamun and Ice cream. Being a Bengali i can say that the payesh and jalebi wont attract the bongs much since they are used to having better tasty payesh and jalebis at home. But overall dessert section was packed and after that much food you wont be able to eat much in this section. But the pick from this section is the Fruit brownie custard.
Thus i can conclude that the overall experience was really good. There are some food types that the cooking can really improve on like their chicken preparation, other than that, the ambiance, hospitality was all satisfying. Hope to be there soon!!

Went there on Nabami midnight on the occasion of Durga Puja. We were not alone there but it seems they were into some hurry, it's obvious as it was late at night but they let people to come in. So, we had their buffet which consisted of kebab starters like chicken, prawn, mutton and fish which was awesome, especially the fish hariyali. Main course was full of different Indian and Chinese cuisine with various salads and in desserts they have brownies, pastries, fruits and sweets. But if you compare with Barbeque nation, I would say later has better to offer you.

If compared to Barbeque Nation and to an extent Sigree, Flame and Grill takes a distant place. The service is slow ( we once had to leave the Starters and go to Main course after waiting a long time for repeat of starters). They also do not serve veg starters if you opt for the non-veg option. 
The main course is a big disappointment. And so are the desserts. 
They are charging same as their competitors but in all spheres, they are way behind - service, food quality, good options, VFM.

Diefinately have to  say "not a value for money", service is bad. And the variety of kebabs they serve is much worst then their competitors. The additional charge for prawns are complete eye wash and they need to understand the difference bewteen prawn and shrimp.

No drinks included in their buffet whereas in BBQ Nantion you get one drink as part of the package which is much cheaper then Flame and Grill.

Bad bad food, without any flavours!
My wife and I went to this restaurant second time around, and we were reminded of an important lesson of life: don't commit the same mistake twice. 
Very bland and un-marinated kebabs. Most of the kebabs were re-heated and not freshly made. The main course was even worse. 
The worst is that the servers don't even mind if the guests are not liking the food. They were very uncaring, and didn't even offer water to us till the end. 
Very bad copy of a popular concept. And by the way, quite costly as well. 700 per head, without any alcohol.

Ok this is mainly famous for its amazing kebabs. Getting the buffet, especially if you include the prawn kebabs, gets you an endless supply of one really scrumptious kebab after another, till you're basically too full to eat anything else. 
On the downside, the main course needs a little more improvement. I'm not saying its not good....just that it could be better, with a little more variety.
All over, a good enough to place to hit more than once.

After wandering along the top floor of Mani square mall, me and my mother finally decided to choose flame and grill. this was my first time here, so was naturally excited. The place was not too crowded and the staff were extremely friendly and guided us when we needed.

We chose the non-veg buffet. There were too many superb appetizers. It started with something called Basa fish, imported from vietnam as they said. Then we had mutton and chicken kebabs and the central grill to reheat the kebab was very nicely though of. They also served us another shale or shell something fish cooked in coriander sauce.  They also had given a chilly tomato sauce and a pudina-coriander one. it mixed well with the appetizers. The starters were so yummy and the waiters refilled them so fast, that soon we were quite full.

Then we moved on to mains section. The egg curry was ok, nothing special. The steamed rice smelled and tasted superb. I did not try the other rice though. Among the veg food, the paneer was good but the gobi one stole the show. The eggplant one was also nice. Their hinger dal was also smelling nice and fresh. 
 The mutton curry was superbly done and the mutton was succulent and tasty.  The chicken and mutton salads were not much of a special thing. There were other salads too. The raita was too tok.

The dessert had brownies, which were quite good. I found the pudding not so good. It tasted as having much butter. The gulab jamun was very appealing to even a bengali sweet loving person as my mother. The kheer was the best i had ever had. But there was a huge crowd for the ice - cream which had four different flavours. It was a nice end to the heavy food.

Conclusion  : This was perhaps my best. So much delcacies and that too rs 528 per person. Its awesome. A must go for all.

Flame & Grill, one of the flagship restaurants of the Speciality Group, is definitely worth a visit. The place is not without negatives, but having said that - it is still somewhere you can go for a lunch or a dinner buffet.

The ambience is pleasing to the eye but not anything special to talk about. The seating arrangement could be a little more friendly, though - if you have a large group, every one in a row has to get up if someone wants to get more food from the buffet. During weekends, reservations are recommended.

The buffet starts off with a variety of kebabs served on coal in your table - with or without prawns, as you choose. The kebabs are varied and the quantity is, as they advertise, "unlimited" - they keep serving till you ask them not to. The Mutton Seekh Kebab is the one that I liked. The prawns are not unimpressive, both in terms of size and taste. The Chicken Kebabs are mostly bland, but if you complement it with the chutney, it recovers some of its glory. The Chicken Wings are however very tasty and I can gorge on them any day. For drinks you can order non-alcoholic Fresh Lime (these are charged extra).
For the main course, you usually have a choice of rice - between Biriyani and Pulao, a choice of Chicken Salad in different dressings, a Chicken Rezala, Mutton cooked in a spicy gravy and Tomato Fish. I found all of these dishes likeable, but none of them were exceptional.
In the dessert section, the Shahi Tukda is fantastic, the ice cream is not worth it - get out of the restaurant and fill yourself at B & R two floors away but the Jalebis and the Gulab Jamuns are awesome. I especially loved the Shahi Tukda, it might have been the effect of the first dessert after a complacent main course, but still, it was pretty good.

Verdict: A buffet costs Rs. 650 per head (with prawns and tax). Good food, but not exceptional standards. You might just want to try it out.

Flame and Grill - It is in the 4th floor of Mani Square right in the front of the escalator. The ambience is good with songs playing in the background. The service is really good and the waiters are really helpful. It's main attraction however is the "unlimited" starters with a buffet. 
There is a real grill in your table with the kebabs put on skewers which quite an innovative idea and thus, you get a really hot meal and I just love this idea. The starters vary, if you are the specific vegetarian you will get Paneer Tikka, Mushroom Kebabs and many more, whereas if you are the non-vegetarian ( you also get an option to choose whether you eat prawns or not.) you would love the Mutton Seekh Kebab, Chicken Kebab (boneless), Chicken Wings (with bones), Prawn Tandoori and Ajwain Fish Kebab etc.The kebabs are very soft and I couldn't even hold the Fish Kebab hold it in my fork, it was so soft but however the kebabs lack flavour and the size of the prawn was so small that I was amazed how they put in the skewer. You can take soft drinks such as Pepsi, Fresh Lime Salted or Fresh Lime Sweet etc. The buffet varies but I got Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Rezala and Tomato Fish, Pulao, Chhole, Chicken Salad etc. A wonderful spread, the desserts are not at all disappointing and the Gulab Jamun were really soft. The Jalebis were a little hard but Shahi Tukra was great as well as the variety of ice cream to put you in a happy mood as you finish. 
Verdict : Try it you will like it.

I have always been a great foodie and when it came to kebabs i am always game. Gorging on different kind of kebabas is my forte.

Well keeping the above statement in my mind i did visit flame and grill mani square branch for the first time.

Ambience wise its a nice place, though i have already been to barbeque nation manier times, my expectation from F&G was much more. I will not be complaining about the quality of food or the menu. But if you want to draw crowd from barbeque nation you need to imbibe some new methods in terms barbequed food menu.

If you are a foodie at heart with a serious appetite and your taste buds are craving for kebabs and only kebabs then you must drop in this speciality restaurant at mani square.
Bite into starters like ajwain fish, mutton seek kabab,tandoori prawn while green lovers can opt for paneer tikka ,mushroom kebab and more.Besides this an elaborate Indian buffet spread after the kebab session is sure to make you drool. The menu is different everyday . It includes six to seven varieties of veg and non veg kebab followed by the main course that includes a vegetable, paneer subzi, chicken and mutton dish and biryani.Not to forget the amazing desserts as well. My favourite is brownie with hot chocolate sauce. You'll love the experience of savouing these tempting delights on any day.

If you want to gorge on food, this is the place to be. the starters are plenty - you can keep on eating as they keep on serving. but the variety is limited. the buffet is just okay type with no dish standing out. the dessert is good.

The service is good and the staff treat you properly even in late hours- most probably because there is no dearth of transportation back home on EM bypass or because their parents taught them to be nice to strangers.

Recommended for one visit at the least.

If you are a lover of Indian/Tandoor starters, here is the place. The buffet offers an unlimited shower of kebabs ranging from chicken to prawn. The fish and mutton kebabs offered are also too good to resist. I rate this place above it's near competitors cause of the sheer taste they bring in the food. The spices used will make you hungry for more. There will hardly be any place in your tummy for the main course. But you may skip it and go straight for the desserts which are an absolute delight. A variety of 10-12 items like gulab jamuns, fruit salad, mousse, brownie, different flavors of ice creams etc will make you drool.

Last week I went there with my husband. The taste of food was really awesome. Waiters and Staff were very much attentive and polite. I liked the Kebabs, specially the Prawn Kebab. In main course they had lots of vegetable items along with Biriyani, Butter Nan, Mutton Curry and Chicken as well. I have tried other buffet restaurants in Kolkata but nowhere did I find such a rich main course with good taste. They accompanied an excellent dessert section also. Ambiance is good though old fashioned.

There was some problem with our Credit Card during payment as it was not accepted by their system due to some technical reason but the officials were really very smart to handle it in alternate way (may be they swapped it in some neighboring food joint).

Went there for buffet like 2-3 times. Im disappointed with their starters. Even if  you are a non-veggie they serve you atleast two veg items. Common any non-veggie out there who would like to have panner & aloo kebabs?? I guess no. The only good thing is the main course, not extraordinary but good enough. 
Ambiance great! Food not cost-worthy.

Went there wid loads of expectations. Chicken kebabs were not as expected. Fish kebabs were good. Chicken wings were very good. Main course was also good. All I can say is that do not expect too much from here but food quality is not that poor at all. Ambiance is good.
