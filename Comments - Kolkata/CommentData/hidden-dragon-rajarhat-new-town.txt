Located at hangout, food court in CC2 and we took a prawn combo at Rs.275. It consists of veg noodles/fried rice, chilli prawn in thai style (4 pieces) and dry crispy chicken. I have eaten here many times and it has been quite pleasurable until this visit. I have ordered for fried rice and they made noodles for me, after waiting for 20 mins, at-last they served us the combo. While having the fried rice, I was like worst I do ever had (tasteless) and the chili prawn was also less cooked. Customer service & food quality both are need to be improved.

Very disappointed with the quality.

Absolutely rubbish food. We ordered a veg Chinese combo which was hardly edible. Everything was stale and had no flavour whatsoever. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. If there was an option to rate in negative,i would have definitely done that

Well not a bad place  to hangout  with  a real pocket  friendly budget! Ambience  was nothing special ... Actually its a common food court  so ambience  really doesn't  get counted. As I had to halt  for  another flight in Kolkata  so had 5 hours and thus decided  to have a stroll in cc2 and came up with  eating  in this restaurant. Well  I will  say, the combo i had ordered  contained noodles, chilli chicken  and drumsticks... Quality  was fine... Lets take it average  same goes for  taste. So overall  yeah I  liked  the experience  üòä

A visit to the Food Court of City Centre asked for something new and hence I thought for an alternative which didn't please everyone of us, but majority agreed to it. One of us were looking for Chinese, other South Indian and me was searching for Sandwiches. So, finally we decided to give all three a go and hence ordered from Hidden Dragon, Curry Patta and Subway in one go.

This outlet of Hidden Dragon is a part of Food Court and hence a small kiosk. I ordered for a single meal comprising of Fried Rice, Prawn Fish, Baby Corn, French Fries along with White Papad.

While the order delivery took about 15 minutes, the staffs were courteous but little on the lazier side.

Once the food appeared for us, we quickly grabbed as we were to share the food. The rice were cooked nicely and I loved it, while the baby corn was crispy and enjoyable. The prawn didn't appeal my taste buds, the french fires was just okay and the papad was pathetic. The worse part is that the papad seemed like a stale one.

I wouldn't advice anyone to have a visit here.

Quick and short trip had an everlasting impression. We ordered for a Chicken Momos which was served with a hot stew. 

Momos took exactly 5 minutes to be served steamily hot. Large sized dumpling had very good quantity chicken was served. This was one of the finest chicken dumplings we have had. Also the stew also deserves a special mention. Only a small request the sauce should be spicier.

Located at City Center-II, New Town, this is the same brand as that of the one at City Center-I, Salt Lake. The place has lost its fame and popularity, and rightly so. The combo meal was a waste of money, and other than the sheer package of a whole lot of things put at one place, there wasn't anything appealing about this place.

Hidden dragon is one of the popular food joints available at the city centre food court- The  Hangout. The one I am reviewing about is the one located at the Rajarhat city centre.

They have the same options of food and combos which other of their outlets has. 
Evenly priced with the quality and quantity. 
One thing I feel that they could reduce the batter thicknesses as this sometimes over pours the main part of the dish.
Service of this outlet is okish but I feel they serve better in other outlet available in CC1.
All in all a decent option.

An average option if you find yourself in Hangout,City Centre 2.Chinese combo meals don't appeal to me and I went for their chicken lollipops.6 pieces cost me Rs.145. Service was on the slower side.The taste is strictly palatable,though they didn't skimp on the chicken part and the lollipops didn't taste of excess batter.They came with fries which were crisp but the sauce in which the lollipops were tossed in was average.

Food court joints are never that great according to me. Few of them are nevertheless decent enough and can be tried and this joint is one of the decent ones. hidden dragon has two other outlets in various malls if I am not wrong and the food tastes average in all the outlets. Most of the times the food is not that good though some items are really well made at times  but comparing the quality and quantity the prices are high. I really like their drumstick and crispy baby corn apart from these other items are not better than road side stalls.

Visited for a quick lunch. Ordered Non Veg and Veg Combo. Non Veg Combo had Chicken Fried Rice, Manchurian and Lollypop. Taste was good. Lollypop could have been better sans it's bright red color. Coming to Veg Combo we got noodles, Veg Chilly and Chilly Babycorn. Noodle was bland as we had to ask for salt and seasoning. Again Chilly Babycorn could have been better without color. I feel with the quantity at that price tag little improvement in quality can make it a hit.

Food is descent, tried the prawn and chicken combo. Quantity was pretty good too, noodles tasted fine but service was awfully slow and the staff quite stubborn. They were pretty prickly when I asked for their permission to take food pics,started educating me about rules. I asked where is it written so they told me to get permission of security. Maybe some recipes they were guarding of national importance.

Only an ignorant person who knows nothing about Chinese food will give a good rating for this restaurant. I happened to make a very BIG mistake by ordering food from here. These people serve white watery goop in the name of gravy noodles, and I saw how difficult it was for the person who had ordered the same ( the table next to mine). I had ordered a non-veg combo, and truly, after having the first spoon, i threw up a little in my mouth. An insult in the name of Chinese and Thai or whatever they like to call it. I wish the Hidden Dragon REMAINS HIDDEN !!!

Was really happy when I saw "hidden dragon". Hoped that will be having some really great time with my friends... Ordered my favo chicken Hakka noodles...!  They provided me chicken along with EGG.. People like me who have some issues will just get mad ova that dish which I was provided..! My friend told me that leave it and have this this time and don't spoil your happy mood..! Started to eat and found that noodles were too thin..! Was really upset and the price tag was also higher than the other ones..! (Meant the branches of HIDDEN DRAGON)

I never rate a restaurant this low & if it was possible on Zomato I'd rate it even lower. You've very little choice when you get sick after consuming their food. We'd ordered for a non-veg combo meal which tasted fine but the effect it'd on our system was disastrous. I've never been this ill after eating out before & neither has been my better half. Fortunately, our son avoided it after one look at the gravy which was unusually very 'red'. I'll take up the issue with them when I visit CC2 next time. As of now, we advise the guests to avoid this outlet as there are other options in the food court.

If you are keen to taste 'Sealdah Flyover area ' street food, while sitting in air conditioned comfort, you can surely come here. Never been a great fan of Hangout, City Centre 2 for my food; but from now on would keep a respectable distance from this fearsome Dragon .
