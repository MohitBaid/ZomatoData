Baghbaar area is the one which I frequently visit for Photowalks. One noon afterâ€‹ some shoot at North Kolkata I visited this pocket friendly place for a lunch. Had plain Rice dal and a sabji of Cauliflower. Food was really good and worthy.
The bill was surprisingly low, just Rs.25. If you are looking for a meal at low price in this area, I guess this is worth visiting.

It's a small eatery at Bagbazar, which serves average food at cheap price.
Quantity is good but quality sucks, spicy and not good for health.
Ambience is shabby with sitting arrangements .
Service is quick .

It's a spice hotel. Cheap but not healthy. Anyone with a pocket pinch of 100 will get a mouth full of dishes.torka with roti is something anyone can give it a try.

It is a local roadside eatery in Bagbazar. You will find regular veg and non veg items here. Nothing special about it. It is pocket friendly eatery.
