Located inside the forum food court.This place did not have a high rating but my friend suggested as she has been here before.So we opted for the non veg Chinese combo which consisted of
Chowmein-tasted simply delicious
Chilli chicken-tasted totally like an authentic chilli chicken should.Totally yum.
Chicken drumsticks-This was the yummiest drumstick I have ever tasted.
A total steal deal at 270rs
HappyEating!

This place is in the forum mall food court. They serve only chinese dish. we were there just to hangout so decided to have some snacks. The guy who was taking the order didn't seem to be very courteous. They served very quickly.
We ordered ching wing chicken along with coke. The best part is prices mentioned in the menu are inclusive of taxes. But coming to food quality it was not that great. It tasted similar to some street side food. The chickens were not boiled properly i guess. And they provided us plastic fork which was unable to cut the chicken. I would not recommend this place.

This place sucks...we ordered a dry chilli chicken, mixed noodles and pan fried fish. The fish was kind of burnt and the dry chilli chicken was burnt and too much salty. Noodles was okeish but not good. Not giving this place a visit again.

Located in the food court of Forum, this place dishes out tasty Chinese, Thai and Mongolian dishes. I specifically love their grill Mongolian veg with spicy schezwan sauce. They give you a bowl and you can fill the bowl with your choice of veggies which they will stir fry with noodles and add the sauces. It's quite spicy and extremely tasty. They also give the option of rice but I've not had that as yet. I prefer the noodles, an old favourite so I stick to it. This time too they delivered on taste, hot and spicy and afterwards I had to cool with a Coke.
Price is somewhat on the higher side but quantity is a lot and I feel too much for one person to have.( They can reduce the price by reducing portion sizes)

This is the usual place I order from when I'm forced to eat in the food court of Forum Mall.. (in general, I try to avoid food courts though).. Flaming Wok serves decent Chinese cuisine... I like their dry chilli chicken and chicken hakka noodles..The price may be a little on the higher side for a food court shop. You can opt for the Non-veg combo meal which is good value for money and sufficient for two-  chicken lollipop, noodles/fried rice and a chicken side. All in all, if you want tasty and filling Chinese food in Forum, this is the place to be..

Perhaps the only decent restaurant/food outlet in this food court, this place serves some delicious food to their patrons. Try the regular Chinese affair here or the sizzlers, most of the products here are quite good. The pricing too is reasonable and the quantity is quite sufficient to satisfy your hunger.

Nothing much to write about this place, a typical desi Chinese stall, you go in, when you wanna grab some quick bites or you wanna keep your seats in the food court of the forum mall.
Last sunday, just before the movie , I grabbed a quick lunch from here. Ordered a plate of chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. The fried rice was decent , no flavour, simple rice fried and some chicken pieces and veggies tossed in. The chilli chicken was heavy on sauce, tender pieces of chicken though.
That's just it, nothing much to expect on our part, nothing much to deliver on their part!

Located in the food court of forum.mall in elgin road,this outlet is partially the saving grace of the otherwise pathetic food court.whenever I am there,i try their non veg mongolian,the noodles option,never tried the rice.for the uninitiated it is basically pan fried noodles in a spicy scezwan gravy or sauce with lots of exotic veggies and chunks of chicken.you can choose your own veggies and amount of each as well.the options are bell peppers,red and green cabbage,corn,bean sprout,  zucchini,mushroom,carrots, baby corn etc.it is spicy and quite tasty.portion is sufficient for one.price is definitely on the higher side,but doesn't dissappoint tastewise.

Situated in the food court of forum mall in elgin road, this place is a gateway for tasty chinese food on a budget. Ideal place for having some comfort chinese when you are out of money. The food is delicious. We ordered chicken chilli garlic noodles. They provide enough quantity to feed 2 hungry stomachs. The noodles was spicy and tasty with adequate portion of chicken and vegetables. The chicken pieces in noodles were tender and  succulent. This is an appropriate place for school and college students

This review was pending for a while. After watching a movie in Inox we went to have lunch in this joint. We had the chicken lollipop tossed in hot n garlic sauce. It was delightful and so yummy.  Then we had fried rice and chicken Manchurian if I remember. It was good. But lollipop has got stuck in my taste buds. Waiting to visit again to try the other dishes.

Given the really high quality of Chinese food available all across the city, I must say this place is not really among the best. It's an okay place. There's hardly any option in terms of soup and then also there were availability issues! I must add, the food is quite average. Nothing really great. For once, I feel like a place has a better rating than what it deserves on zomato. This place is definitely nothing special and I don't really think I will ever try this place again. Nonetheless, I guess you can try this place once because apparently quite a few people like the food here. Happy Dining!

Even the service was lousy, there was none present at the stall to take order. We had to wait for nearly 5mins then the lady in the adjoining stall took the order. It was a really terrible experience. A huge NO... just dont go there.

It's in Elgin mall at 4th floor. I was with my girlfriend and its 3rd dec ( my girlfriend's birthday). We both were hungry, so we decided to have lunch before we walked into Inox..
We ordered crispy baby corn chili,veg hakka chow & sweet and sour chicken.
I personally liked baby corn chili but veg hakka chow was disgusting, i didn't like it at all... it was my gf birthday, so i don't want to spoil my mood
so we had lunch and went for movie.
For me it was an average food not so good.

One of the best outlets at the Forum- Elgin food court. The other day I tried their chilli chicken dry, which was an absolute delight. I would definitely recommend this place for a light lunch in between a shopping spree at Elgin. The cramped and suffocating ambience of the Forum mall food court is however a dampener, though not specific to this outlet. I must mention that this place is decently priced as well !

Doubtful gravy had any wasabi as even cook barely knew how to make it. Plus is you can watch how your stuff is cooked. 750 rs. Still relatively inexpensive and served four people.

Flaming Wok is undoubtedly one of my favourite places to order food whenever I find myself in the very limited forum Elgin road food court. The food court can honestly do with some new shops for sure but believe me this place is surely going to make you fall in love with their dishes. Served in record time, I absolutely love two of their dishes. 
1.Crispy Chilli Babycorn : They are crispy and nicely flavoured and makes up for a great snack if you are just hanging out in the food court and chatting with a friend! 

2.Non Veg Mongolian : This one is a superb option if you are seriously hungry and looking for a good wholesome meal. The non vegetarian Mongolian dish allows you to select from wide range of fresh vegetables ranging from broccoli to baby corn to onions to capsicums, they are all mixed and pan fried with noodles and some amazing sauces! The nice and soft chunks of marinated chicken added to the dish only enhances it's flavours and is absolutely delicious. Served hot this one has been my favourite for a very long time, it's spicy and amazing to eat. 
Their staff is quite friendly and takes hardly any time to serve your order and the price is moderately reasonable. They have a wide range of dishes but in the last ten years I don't think I have ordered anything else apart from these two dishes out here, they are that good. I simply love their food and would happily recommend it to everyone.

One of the few quick-bites options in Forum Mall, Flaming Wok serves mainly Chinese preparations alongside some Mongolian dishes as well. This outlet sees heavy crowd during evening and also descent crowd in the afternoon.

I and a friend of mine decided to have our lunch at Forum mall and choose this place over Pizza Hut just to save a few bucks. We ordered one Non-Veg Combo meal as it was said by them that it would be sufficient for two. The combo meal comprised of Rice/Noodle (option), Chilli Chicken (4 pieces) and Chicken Lollipops (2 pieces).

Noodles were descent and properly cooked as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. Chilli Chicken was a big disappointment, firstly the pieces of Chicken was too small and secondly, they were hard to chew and neither tasted any good. The gravy was also tasteless. Chicken Lollipop were standard in size and tasted okay.

Service was too slow, it took them over 20 minutes to serve our order, with just one Non-veg Combo Meal. They did not give any tissue papers until we had ask them for.

Pricing was on higher side as it is with most food stalls in Forum's food court. Most starter dishes exceeded ₹150 and main course was around ₹180-200 so it is not very budget friendly to order separate dishes.

I am not at all a fan of the Food Court at Forum.I feel most of the outlets are way overpriced.But I must admit this is one of the better options available in the Burp food court at Forum.
The Chinese is pretty decent and the Mongolian is also a good option.The Crispy Chili Babycorn is really nice.The good thing about their highly rated Mongolian is that you get to choose the vegetables and spices you want and in the proportions of your choice also.This is a great option to have.They generally cater to your choices quite flawlessly.The vegetables and spices are usually quite fresh.The quantity is decent too.
The prices are almost similar to proper restaurants.But then that is always an issue with Burp food court.But quality wise this is surely one of the better outlets in the forum food court.

Location: Food Court, Forum Mall.

Discovered this place a few years back.
Just happened to cross by, and simply got pulled towards it by the aroma of the Mongolian which was being tossed in the wok!
:-P
Since then, a favorite halt point for Mongolian!

Coming to the point,
This place serves undoubtedly the best Mongolians I have come across.
They prepare it exactly the way you instruct them. The right amount of spice and sauces they are instructed to.
Just to check through their efficiency, I have tried ordering Mongolians with different spice levels.
They catered to it flawlessly!

Though I have always stuck to my Mongolian order out here but my colleagues have given a feedback of a great Chinese palate as well.
Yet to try.

Price hikes have lead to a rise of prices here as well, but that's completely acceptable since the rise is influenced by an external inflationary force.
Quality remains the same, Top notch.

 A great experience on the whole. :-)
Thumbs up. (y)

Flaming Wok is one of the better option at Food court in forum mall serving decent chinese fare and a pretty good mongolian though the preparation has not quite stayed that good over years. 

The prices of the place used to be very reasonable earlier but with quite a few hikes they are very much at par with good restaurants though with generous quantities being served, they are pretty much worth it. I have tried their chinese starters and crispy chilli babycorn is the best of whole lot and is pretty good, others being average in my opinion. Coming to their mongolian, they let you choose your vegetables and proportions yourself if you want. The quality of the vegetables is pretty good, just that they do not display the broccoli at times and you need to ask for it. They used to make it very well earlier, customised exactly to my liking each time i ordered for it but nowadays the preparation feels inconsistent and at times not up to the mark. Overall the food here is quite decent but nothing as outstanding to head to forum just to eat here.

HORRIBLE. JUST HORRIBLE. I WOULD'NT EVEN GIVE THIS RESTAURANT 1 STAR. IT DESERVES 0 STARS! First of all the food was not so good. Second of all, I found a bloody cockroach in my Hakka noodles. I went to complain to the manager of Forum and we said that we can't do anything about it. What shit is this? Nobody go to this restaurant. It's not worth it at all.

Flaming Wok for me means the mongolian prepared here.It is absolutely excellent and they have maintained consistency in their preparations since so many years.The first thing i do when i take a burp card is head to this place and order a mangolian noodles in hot garlic sauce.Infact i have experimented with all their sauces included in the mongolian menu.I carefully select my veggies and put dem in the bowl.A true mongolian fanatic would know, you shouldnt fill it with lots and lots of veggies!Carefully select a few that you like.i usually choose peppers,onions,zucchini, mushrooms,babycorn and red cabbage.
This place has never disappointed me with their mongolian!It is at times better than the mongolian at red kitchen and lounge!(the inconsistency being at red lounge not here)
I have also tried other stuff here,namely spring rolls and crispy chilli babycorn.Both of the dishes were wonderful. 
Their portions are generous and extremely satisfying. 
Pricing for me is pretty decent, though a few friends suggest it is a little expensive,but i dont find it to be,the credit for this partiality goes to my favourite mongolian noodles. *gushes*

The rating here is absolutely for the Mongolian they serve here. 
It's the best ever!
Whenever I'm at forum I make sure to have their Mongolian which is served piping hot.  I don't even know how many times have I burnt my tongue attempting to eat it just the moment it was served :P

Besides the Mongolian I've also tried their babycorn and chilli paneer which are good too. 
The staffs are courteous and unlike other stalls they come and serve the food to your table. :)

One of the ubiquitous food outlets at Burp, the food court at Forum Mall. This one dishes out Chinese and Mongolian fare. Apart from regular Chinese items (though often they do not have soups available), they do small combo meals (with a chicken / veg starter, main course and rice / noodles. They even have Mongolian stir fry on offer (they taste like normal Chinese). Food is nothing exceptional, nor is it served well. Most of the items are over-spicy. Being Forum, I feel some of the stuff is overpriced as well.

Over the years I have had soups (very basic), combo meals (spicy and tacky), stir frys and the lot. Never been terribly impressed.

Both of us were so exhausted looking for a good cafe in the area, that we finally decided to give up and settle for the forum food court yet again. We tried almost every outlet and this was the one left out, so we went for it. We decided to stick to starters: Chilli Chicken Dry and Chilli Garlic Prawns. The size and the quantity of the chicken was small though. But little did I know that it was more than enough for us. It was succulent, tasty and it was really hot. The Chilli Garlic Prawns with a thin garlic gravy tasted really yummy. But as soon as I started tasting the gravy, I started sweating and literally tears came down rolling my eyes. Fortunately we ordered a beverage prior to tasting them. It was a welcome change for us as we were expecting the same chinese dish with a sweet tomato sauce base.  It's definitely worth a try..

Flaming Wok serves up decent enough chinese food at the Food Court but my favorite thing to order here is the Mongolian. The Chicken Manchow Soup , Chili Garlic Prawn , Chili Chicken Dry and Non-Veg Mongolian are the items I recommend and usually that is exactly what we order. The do a decent job with the Mongolian and you can ask for your choice of sauces and levels of spice so as to suit your individual taste. One portion is enough for one person so if your a couple its a good idea to share the dish and order a soup and starter to make for a bit of variety.

With whats on offer at the lousy food court of forum, This place stands out and proves to be just above OK ! The chili chicken is decent and the drum of heaven are tasty but everything they make is very very oil , they have a Mongolian barbecue but its strictly average. The girl on the counter on my last visit looked like she will fall asleep in the counter . Strictly average in terms of taste and barely swallow-able. 

However the service is quick and the old gentleman taking the order is very sincere and polite.

So, I liked this place so much that I made the effort to find it on Zomato ! We had ordered for starters only.....Chilli Chicken Dry and Chilli Garlic Prawns. Ahh.....what can I say about them....Ever tasted something that was so fiery hot that you have tears in your eyes but it still taste so amazing that you eat every last morsel of it ?? That was it ! Honestly, I'm a bit tired of the Chinese dishes in the city having a sweet tomato base when the name includes the word 'chilli'....and I'm glad this was indeed hot and spicy. The chicken, though a bit less in quantity, did taste yummy. The prawns....quite decent sized ones....were prepared in a delicious garlicky gravy. A tip.....do keep a sweet drink or something handy, you'll need it. Situated at the Forum mall food court, this place is a pretty good option for Chinese....Do give it a go. 4 stars from me. :)

This restaurant is one of my favourite stalls in Burp. They really prepare very delicious chinese dishes at affordable prices.. Chicken wanton and manchow soup is really very well made and for starters even chicken lollipop and crispy pan fried chilly fish is very nicely done. Food quantity is appropriate for 2 people and quality is also fresh. Staff are friendly and informative. They do not take much time to serve the food but once they had taken almost 20 to 25 minutes to prepare a portion of chicken drumsticks. Overall it is a nice place.
I would rate 4.0 for Flaming Wok.
