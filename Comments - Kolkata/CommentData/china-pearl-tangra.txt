Yesterday I went there with my family. We ordered threaded fish - half plate & 1 lung Fung soup as starter. We all liked the fish item much than the soup. But the soup was also good. After that we ordered schezwan chicken fried rice 1 plate, chicken gravy noodles 1 plate &  schezwan chicken 1 plate. It was damn good. Altogether we had to pay Rs 1121 only along with 1 bottle of cold drink (forgot to mention). I really appreciate the food served there. Quantity is also OK. Though we didn't liked the rice item. It was OK type. Rice was sticky a bit. Other than that all items we liked. We are planning to go there Durga Puja time also. I also liked the ambiance.

Location is at the heart of China Town.In between two big names,Big Boss and Beijing.
Bar cum restro is at the ground floor,family restro is upstairs.
The waiters here are highly unprofessional.
They could not suggest a nonspicy starter.According to them,all the items in their menu are spicy.
Well,ordered Mongolian Chicken Dry.
It was good,yet a bit spicy.
Then some Senior Waiter took our orders and served us Chicken Drums of Heaven.It was good indeed.
Although it wasn't a pleasant experience,but the whole thing ended well.
Would like to visit again.

Yesterday me and my friend went there for a sumptuous dinner thinking about 3.5 ratings registered by other followers. We ordered for schezwan chicken, thread fish, hot garlic chicken, dry chilli chicken and chicken hakka noodles. Every servings were salty and extremely high on spices. We ate it as we were very hungry. The food was okay but when you think tangra eateries only word that comes after a munch is WOW. That was missing there for sure. The nightmare started at 3 o'clock in the morning with terrible stomach upset and it persisted till late evening today. Had nearly escaped being hospitalised. Though the staff handling our order was polite and well manered but I will personally never visit this joint as I don't want to ruin the next day.

I visited this restaurant last month but 4got to post a review....newaz......M doing it now....I visit the various restaurants of China town(tangra) because of two main reasons (i) Authentic Chinese food (ii) Satisfactory quantity of food within pocket limits..ðŸ˜Ž and this one suffices both of my criteria..... Staffs r not very helpful though.... Food is good.... Although the quantity is better than the quality..ðŸ˜‰.... which is good 4 me..... Spacious enough (like other tangra restaurants only,so nothing special about it) but the main thing to mention here is,the price they charge you with, is much less compared to the other restaurants in this area......This one might look like a low profile restaurant from outside....But cm'on.... I mean , who cares,as long as it's in China town.... U'll always get good food out there...... U guys can check this one out,if all u worry about is enjoying a "budget meal".......

Me and my friends were looking for a reunion, we thought about eating Chinese dishes, so we came here after watching some nice review of this restaurant.
We had ordered hot garlic chicken, kfun pao chicken and chicken friedrice, the serving time was not that bad, the ambience was good. The food's taste were great even, the price was very reasonable. We had some whiskey as well. The bill came for 4 people around â‚¹1700, which is considerably very reasonable. 
       One thing could have been better I personally felt is the quantity of rice providing in any fried rice dishes could have been more. It is actually too less.

Well it's in China Town hence nothing new as such to mention about this place. It's a moderately decorated place with a smoking area. The food was good, especially Korean Chicken nd the prawn. It's quite reasonable with pocket friendly booze as well. The waiter served us well nd it was a great experience all together.

Food was really good and reasonably priced. Unfortunately let down by the lack of choice of beer (calsberg, turborg, Budweiser) and also the noise in the restaurant was constantly too loud to be able to hear your tables conversation.

Before go through entire review some points you should note
1)a pint of beer at 200
2) average cost of two 600/700 (excluding alcohol)

I went there yesterday, they have different sections and most probably the first floor is family sections where a girl can drink and no risk of getting a bad stare ; though near 9p.m I have seen they made tables for girls in the ground.
Ambiance: not so well though it's clean and cozy like most of the restaurants in China town. The lights may give you good feelings while boozing. It's 3 from me
Food: I ordered chicken noodles(gravy) , Peking duck,beer.
Oh zomato you should change some points, you can't get a pint of beer at 170, it's minimum 200.
Chicken noodles was average in taste and quantity was good.y you shouldn't try it there unless you're too much hungry and running out of money..unless go for other dishes
Peking duck..oh that's damn good..we waited 15mins because they said "it takes time" and we waited and had booze then they served it.the portion of meat was prominent the juice was really good.
You can have good food there when you're running out of money.
Average cost for two people 700bucks(without alcohol)
For food it's 3/5
Service: I can't deny a good service there,t he waiters behaved really good and they were helpful. I'm satisfied with the service.so I can rate it 4/5

The food is very good and affordable. After so much of experimenting with Chinese, sometimes the conventional is a sigh of relief. 
The portions are huge and the place is quiet. 
The only thing lacking is good service. It's doable.

China Town has always been a family favorite and after visiting almost all the more famed eateries in the area we decided to experiment with some of the lesser ones.. Seeing the positive reviews of the more acclaimed foodies we decided to give this place a try and boy oh boy, what a find it is.. Surely from now on this place will top the list whenever I venture to visit Tangra.. Follow the alley from Beijing towards Hot Wok Village and China Pearl will fall on the right just before Hot Wok..

They have two sections, ground floor for stags and 1stÂ floor for families, ambiance very minimalistic but hygienic and appropriate.. We went to the 1stÂ floor and since it was noon time around 1.30pm they were not properly ready with their dÃ©cor and arrangements and had to wait for some time.. Apart from that service was proper though the server seemed confused while recommending us the dishes.. I had to rely on the reviews of expert foodies while choosing from the menu.. Coming to the food we tasted:

Fresh Lime Soda: Canâ€™t think of a more refreshing way to start a meal.. However would have loved a little bit less sweetness..

Dragon Prawn: For the first time I found babycorn accompanying this dish.. tasted quite unique and delectable, loved the crispness of the tiger parwns, sizes were decent and the dish may taste a bit spicy for some though I thoroughly enjoyed the heat from chillies, sauces and pepper..

Thread Fish: Undoubtedly their flagship dish and prepared with utmost expertise.. Such simple yet supreme flavors.. Basically fish fingers coated with rice noodles and deep fried.. I can actually go back to this place just to taste this dish once more.. Passionately Recommended..

Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken: At some places, they tend to make the chicken a bit over-crisp losing the juice of the chicken in the process.. But here the chicken retains the moistness and flavors while aptly crunchy and crisp with the adequate punch coming from the chillies and pepper..

Steamed Garlic Chow: Another novel experience for the palate.. Simple ingredients yet bursting with flavors.. Not overdone with veggies, just boiled chicken morsels and spring onions with a generous presence of garlic.. Would have been perfect if they used a little less oil..

Special Fried Rice: Ordered on serverâ€™s recommendation, but honestly nothing special about it.. Simply Mixed Fried Rice with addition of few babycorn and mushroom pieces but felt to make any significant value addition to the dish..

Malaysian Fish: Another nicely prepared side dish.. Fresh fish cubes in a mild red based gravy with capsicum, tomato and garlic.. tasted extremely good with the noodles..

Overall it was indeed a better dining experience where only food counts barring ambiance and theme.. The best thing was off-course the economical pricing as our total cheque was just Rs. 1609/- (all incl.) inspite of savoring so many dishes.. Definitely a thumbs up..

Food: 4.5/5

Pricing: 4.5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5

If you want a dash of China Town with penny in your pocket, visit this place. Just beside Big Boss, it has a biiiig parking space, and quiet, really quiet place.
Me and my friend visited this place at evening, when we decided to take some Crispy Chilli Honey Chicken and some drumsticks. It was good although Chicken was made crispy with some additives that was too heavy on the food.
Altogether I found the ambiance and staff cordial and responding. Pricing is good as you may have seen from the menu. Good enough.

As it stands, though, its a misfire. It's good only when the customers are a little drunk, a little high, maybe both and in any event extremely hungry. The food was very bad compared to other restaurants in the area and the service that's provided, at least hire people who have had primary education. We ate the "meal" as fast as possible and left very disappointed. Would not recommend this restaurant.

The only thing i didn't like is their service. The staffs were under trained. And it took ages for them to serve our order. But as soon as the food arrived, no complains with the food what so ever.

One of the better places in Tangra with predictably cheap booze and oily food. Most of the dishes are average but none intolerable. Good portion sizes at a decent price. Service is very cordial and prompt. For best results order simple 'chilly chicken-fried rice-mixed hakka noodle-coke/alcohol'. No diet coke available.

All the good comments on Zomato had raised my expectations, but it proved to be a let down. Booze is cheap and so is the food; but it lacks taste. And the final bill wasn't too "cheap" as well, it was okayish. There were only three occupied tables including us, and the service was still too slow. Along with the waiter being clueless.
We'd ordered a dry Chilli Chicken (which was more of a fried chicken without much taste), a mixed noodles and a Chicken Manchurian (gravy this time, but that didn't alter the experience much). Had two bottles of beer and 3 pegs of whiskey, as well.
It amounted to around 2k, which is a tad expensive for the quality they serve. My suggestion would be to skip it, as there are others in the neighborhood which will provide quality food in that price.

Visited this place on Dashami for dinner. After visiting Kimling, Big Boss and Beijing For so many times, wanted to explore some new places. After lots of browsing on zomato, decided to dine here. The menu was shortlisted due to puja, so we were not able to try the Thread Fish which is almost recommended by everyone. But, it was great experience, the food really was delicious. Ordered Chicken Drumsticks and Spring Fish for starters and both were amazing, specially the fish. But, what I was really impressed with was the main course. We ordered Mixed Fried Rice (meifoon was not available) and Chilli Chicken ( ordered Chilli Fish but was given chicken instead, but not complaining). In fact, the chicken was crispy fried and the gravy was light. The staff's were friendly and nothing much about their ambience, just like other China Town restaurants. So, overall pretty impressed.

"Pathetic" is the single word to describe this place and the food they serve.We were forced to enter into this place only because this is the single place in the entire China Town to get parking space on a mad Saptami night.And once our food was served we understood the reason behind.
We went for Hot & Sour Chicken Soup,chicken noodles, chicken fried rice,chilly pepper fish,hot garlic chicken and Antiquity Blue.Except the fish & the soup nothing was edible.The noodles could not even meet the street side food joint standard!
On top of this the waiter refused to serve the soup 1:2 due to some unknown reason! And the cherry on the cake was the bill dispute at the end!
Damn!Would never go back here!Poor service,inedible food quality and intolerable ambience- to sum it up!!!Anshuman

If you are a china town frequenter and are bored with the same-dish-different-restaurant thing, then you may want to visit it. But the food, though various, lacks a finishing punch. Overall, it is average but offers a respite from the madenning crowd of the two most overhyped eateries if you do choose it.

I visited this restaurant just yesterday for the first time with some of my close friends and found it great for hangouts. Surprisingly it was less crowded as compared to other China Town restaurants, especially over the weekend.
Drinks are available at a pretty reasonable rate. I had Tom Yum soup which I felt was a little more sour than usual.
The specialty dish here is Garlic Pepper chicken, which was quite good, the chickens did not become soggy and had a crunch.
I felt the Rice noodles are worth a try and tasted awesome, even better than the normal noodles.
The ambianceÂ was quite, the restaurant was not over the top decorated which I liked. Service is good, and the staffs were friendly.

Overall experience good.

This two storied air conditioned chinese destination cannot be missed if one looks for some delicious food and liquor at relatively lower prices (than the popular competitor Big boss next to it) and an absolute decent family place with newly renovated interiors , stylish washroom and friendly staff. We had a great time last weekend , with two starters THREADED FISH and CHILLI GARLIC PEPPER FISH (so good that we had to order it twice) , both of which deserves recommendation and some PRAWN CHIPS over our pegs of hard drinks and fresh lime soda. Our maincourses were CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES (with scanty amount of chicken in it , hence a mark less) AND MALAYASIAN CHICKEN which we all loved. They were generous enough and offered us few extra pegs of whisky on the house , overall it was a pocket friendly booze session along with quality food ; therefore deserves recommendation from my side .

The next time ordered schezwan fish and crispy honey chicken , loved the former but the honey dish was over sweet.

And I would suggest that if you want best Chinese of city go to Chinatown. Alcohols are also very cheap there compared to other places of the city.

I have been in Kolkata for the last 4 months and during this period of time my experience of Chinese food was not that great. One of my friend told me that in ChinaTown the restaurant's serve authentic Chinese food. So I went to a random restaurant (China Pearl), from so many options which were there Â and I would say the experience in China Pearl was great.Â 

In starter category we ordered Thread Fish (which is a must try) , Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken and Thai Fried Fish. Â I would say if you are ordering Thread fish do not go for Thai fried fish as both comes under the same category.

In main course we ordered Malaysian Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Prawns(highly recommended).Â 
Â Â 

The restaurant overall serve's very good food with average price and good ambience. The staff members were very friendly and the time taken to serve the food was very less.

I visited this place after reading the reviews with my family and I am not happy at all with the quality of the food, except the chicken fried rice. The ambience and service was good though. I have taken parcel for 6 person and the quantity served by them was same as per the price, it means the price is low so the quantity is also low. Earlier I have visited other restaurants in that area, where the price are high but the quantity of the food is also high, so the overall cost will be same, but they should try to improve the quality of the food. 

The strange thing I have experienced first time in my life, that they do not provide any type of sause with the parcel and the service tax rate is 5.8 %, where as the actual rate is 5.6%. I do not know, why they take service tax on the take away foods, because I have never seen this in any south Kolkata restaurants. When I asked about the clarification for the service tax they just said this is the system of "China Town" they take service tax on the parcel also, as if China Town is outside India.

We have tried all well known restaurants in Tangra but not China Pearl till now. The first floor of the restaurant for family has been refurbished making it one of the best interiors in the area. Its is not that huge in area but still gives a personal touch. Glass panes makes the ambiance airy during daytime.
In starters one must try Thread Fish, very less people know they are the inventor of the same now available in few other restaurants too. It's a must try. Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken can't be missed too. In veg too one have option to try Crispy Mushroom with Chilli Babycorn.Â 
Before going to main course have a sip to hot Manchow Soup. Another specialty of them.
In main course try Steamed Garlic Noodle with Dragon Prawn. Taste won't leave you disappointed. Have parking option inside the restaurant campus too.

China pearl is a small restaurant in the midst of china town. I have been there once with my friends on our way from eco park. This place saved us, as we were tremendously hungry and were completely drenched. The price is a bit costly compared to the place though there quality of food is nice. I personally liked there chicken fried rice.

Visited China Pearl recently and I must say the food is excellent and the new section is really posh. Very good value for money. Staff are polite and the owner too is very courteous. I would personally recommend this joint to everyone who is looking for great ambience and great food.

Been there 4-5 times with family. Will recommend threaded fish, mix noodles, chicken 65 and pepper chicken.
1st floor is spacious, arranges for parking slots at any point in time. Will recommend for family.

Went to the stag section ( ground floor ) . Ambiance is nice ,  however I hear that 1st floor family section is better . 

China pearl is located ,  between Big-Boss & hot-wok village .

Do not be confused between China Pearl & China Gate . Both are separate , despite being close to each other . 

from the outside , it does not look appealing at all , but ambiance inside is good . 

In Food Dragon Prawn is a must try . Absolutely recommended .

Â  By china-town standards alcohol is a bit highly priced . For example Teacher's Large peg ( 60 ml ) will cost around Rs 250 + TAX . A bit pricey by china town standards 

Coming to My experience , reached there on an early september afternoon , with a friend .

In  starters we ordered HALF Plate  Dragon Prawn ( Rs 350 ) , along with our usual poison . i.e    2 large pegs ( 60 ml )   of mcdowells rum & 1 Small peg ( 30 ml ) of the same .

Dragon prawn was mind blowing . succulent , crispy & tangy at the same time . Half Plate had 6 medium sized pieces .

after finishing off our drinks , we a felt a bit more hungry . hence ordered two more side dishes .    Half plate crispy fried  fish  , & half plate kung pao fish .

Crispy fried  fish ( 7 pieces ) was indeed crispy & tasted good with alcohol . 

kungpao fish came ( 6 pieces )  in a semi red gravy , which was ok ok type .

we left satiated & satisfied . 

The  Bill came at Rs 1127 ( all inclusive ) . The break up is as follows 

2 Large Peg mcdowell rum ( 60 ml )  : 2 X 70 = Rs 140 

1 Small peg Mcdowell rum  ( 30 ml ) : 1 X 40  = RS 40

3 Bottles of thumbs up     ( 300 ml )  : 3 X 30 = Rs 90 

1/2 Half plate dragon prawn              :1 X 350 = Rs 350

1/2 Half plate crispy fried fish            :1 X 175 = Rs 175 

1/2 half plate kung pao fish               : 1 X 165 = Rs 165

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Total bill  :  Rs 960 

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  + 14.5 % VAT

Â Verdict : Good food , Decent ambiance , worth trying once 

Â 3.5/5 from my side .

Cheers  !!!

It's not so famous a joint in China Town but better than many of the more talked about ones.It's a favourite mostly due to d availability of halves and pints.
The decor is simple nd d ambience in good.The food is good and inexpensive and d service is even better.It's definitely worth visiting once.
(P.S. It's not open till 12)

By the looks of it,it's a very ordinary place. The decor is simple. Atmosphere is calm. Food was good, enough for one person. But I am disappointed with the over all experience. The only good thing I did like was the note on "how to use the chopsticks "...It was fun for first timers using chopsticks.

Just been there with my sister yesterday upon some good review from my friends. Was utterly dissapointed with the quality of food been served there. The cost is same as Beijing but the later is sky apart in quality and quantity. The service is decent and the owner approached us for suggestions but the food was very normal to Tangra standards. Will not visit again and will stick to my other fav as Beijing, Kim Ling and Golden Joy. Offcourse to add the thing as they do not have any parking like the others and the ambeince is very low market.

It was a Saturday afternoon and again a friends outing so after hearing some good reviews about the booze and food we headed here. The ambiance is not worth mentioning about it reminds u of some old houses with oil paints done on the wall. 
The lightings were yellow n dull use to the bulbs used. We went to the family section located on the 1st floor.staff helped us in placing the order. The place was completely deserted. Coming to the food we ordered

Chicken 65: was quite spicy, the chicken pieces were hard though
Chilli pepper fish: awesome is the only word to describe it
Malaysian prawn: the best of the lot which was lip smacking
Dragon fish: another good dish
Singapore noodles : fantastic prep and flavours
Beer and whisky

The booze was cheap no doubt but the food price was like any other tangra joint. Our order amounted to 1800 with 45 service tax . The food was better then most of the joints in tangra and so was the quantity .The staff didn't have the patience to wait for the tip thrusters upon is to provide one once the bill was cleared . That was a major let down. 

To summarise 
Food : 4.5/5
Ambiance 2.5/5
Service 2.5/5
Overall 3.5

China Pearl has remained a favorite of my office colleagues mostly due to the availability of halves and pints instead of pegs :-) But , I have always found their food cooked very well.

Chilly Pepper Garlic Chicken , Crispy Chilly Fish , Golden Fried Prawns with Sweet and Hot dip , Crispy Sweet and Sour Chicken  stand out in the starters.



I had also visited the family section upstairs with my family. It is clearly the 1st floor of a house converted to a diner.

Loved the overall homeliness ! Food was as good as you get in China Town !

We ordered chicken gravy noodles , mixed fried rice , garlic chicken and chilly fish.

Fish was certainly bhetki , which was a surprise to us all ! The dumplings were fried to the right extent and the gravy was not too gooey.

Overall , worth a definite visit. !

Food is good and inexpensive. Family seating is upstairs and ambience is moderate. They don't serve you the liquor bottle in your table. Instead if you order a 375 ml they provide you the same in pegs. Generally it's not always crowdy and that's the reason me and my friend like it. Service is also good. Separate space for parking is available.

China Pearl is one of the not so famous restaurants in Tangra (China Town) which serves pretty decent Chinese at reasonable pricing.

Located a few steps away from Big Boss and Beijing, the ambiance is just okay with the ground floor for stags only and the 1st floor seating reserved for family dining. Interiors as nothing much to write home about, in fact the family dining area feels more like a homely ambiance. I have always found a seat immediately upon entering as it is not one of the most sought after dining places in the area.

I have tried quite a number of items on the menu on my several visits to the place. I like the chili garlic pepper chicken/fish and the thread fish for starters. For the mains i usually order chicken with vegetables as it has generous amount of fresh vegetables along with very tasty gravy. Adding a dollop of chili sauce spices it up a bit and is one of my favourites coupled with The Hakka Noodles.. I have not tried the fried rice so I should not comment on that.
Drinks on the other hand is priced very reasonably. They have also a special measurement of 390ML which translates into 6.5 large pegs which is priced lower than the 375 ml bottle.

This is a place where you can chill with your friends. Usually the family section is very quiet and peaceful but sometime you may encounter huge groups who might create a ruckus and sadly the management does not say anything. Otherwise it is a nice place to 
drink and chill your friends without hurting the pocket too much. Drinks and food for two should be within Rs1000 (depending the brand and quantity). Definitely will be back for more !
Btw Parking is not available, but you get cabs right outside

Not one of the most famous places in Tangra, so to say, China Pearl is actually quite good and better than many of the more talked about restaurants of the area. Strolling around the area at 5:00 in the evening, we decided to enter this restaurant to chill, drink and eat. And do all of it cost effectively. Zeroing on BP as the cheapest whisky on the list, we figured out the existence of a 390 ml side by side with a 375 ml. The latter cost more. The 390 ml though more in amount was cheaper in price! 
On inquiring, the mystery came down to basically sealed and non-sealed stuff. Giving a pint is less cost effective for the restaurant as compared to opening a 1 litre bottle. Thus the 390 ml is an arrangement of 6 and a half pegs that they provide over a period of time. To those who land up to drink and chill, I see no reason as to why one should compromise on 15 ml of liquor, that too for a cheaper price! Thus, obviously, we did not. 
Landing up with a bhetki fanatic steered the food order to chilli garlic pepper fish. Served within fifteen to twenty minutes, the fish was piping hot, tasted really good and complimented the drinks well. The fish, as claimed by the restaurant, was honestly bhetki, and had sufficient amount of the fried chilli and garlic base. I loved gulping on the crispy yet soft and tasty onion, chilli and garlic, and swept my plate clean. 
The ambience is more like a few chairs placed across various rooms of a house, but that does not spoil the atmosphere, rather adds a non chalant effect to the entire experience. We sadly had been around an extremely rowdy crowd bringing the roof down, but then again, we were busy eating and chatting, really did not care, and had a bloody good time. Visit the place with friends and I bet you shall not be disappointed.

Writing this review to clear a wrong information given here. 
This place DOES NOT stay open till 12am. 
I arrived there with my boyfriend at 10.20pm. The rude & over smart guard outside barked at us saying, everything in Tangra closes at 10.30pm. Go to Park Street instead! 
We however walked a few steps and entered Big Boss instead. It was very much open. The last order at Big Boss is taken at 10.45. We had  a great time there till 11.30pm.
So ya, need a late night dinner at Tangra, head to Big Boss, NOT China Pearl.

China is a good restaurant. But unfortunately the day i had visited this restaurant most of the items on the menu were not available and therefore most of my family members who went with me were disappointed, nevertheless the restaurant Owner David Liu compensated me by organizing darshan dessert which is usually not on the menu but had it made specially for me 
The Kung fuo prawns i found to be but spicy. I loved the chowmein and and the rice also.
Although the ambience can be a bit better. The service staff are very hospitable.
