It feels like home whenever I'm here.. The place is small but the quality and quantity is satisfactory.. If you're in picnic garden and craving for some authentic Chinese then do visit this place.. the staffs are very friendly and this place is worth the money..

This being situated right next to my home, is one of the most preferred restaurants in the locality. A very small joint and the services could definitely not be better than what is offered. Well behaved staff, and moderately clean restaurant which serves perfectly for the locality. Â The food here is nice and one will definitely be content after dining in/from here. Recommended: Mixed Scheswan Fried rice and Garlic Chicken.

Flamez is located in picnic garden area and serves Chinese cuisines . Not a proper eating place but just a ok sort of place with 3 to 4 tables and has an environment air conditioned .The eating place is pretty clean and has a TELEViSION too for visual entertainment . Not bad for place like picnic garden where food eataries are not very satisfactory . Many people tend to take home delivery and some even prefer eating there .I have often seen people sitting in their home dressed clothes tucking in soups and  other foods as they live right in the lanes where this restaurant is situated. That's very interesting and funny too but has  as a sense of a homely ambience . The owner seems to be a bengali not much sure about it but knows alot about his restaurant and his Chinese cuisine that is prepared . 

As i took a seat i was offered water by a sweet Nepali boy who probably was just appointed the job and was learning the skills of service. He was often instructed by the owner what to do and that poor boys innocence was a very sad thing to watch . Nevertheless we all take time to learn things slowly in life i am sure he will too learn it soon .

Talking about the food over here well as it was 3 past noon and i had literally started feeling very hungry ,so now after i sipped water here and  after cooling down thanks to the ac i had then started my order which was :

EGG FRIED RICE - loaded fully on a big plate sufficient for two people and cooked with egg scrambled inside out and on taste & colour it was brownish and was nicely cooked but a little oily.

VEG HAKKA CHOW - Thick noodles cooked in soya sauce and fried with a mix of chopped veggies and ingredients and on taste was again oily and little blunt ,maybe the flavours did not go right.

LEMON CHICKEN - A sweet aroma and a sweet taste of Chicken made with real lemons and essence had some nice soft tender chicken pieces but was not going well with noodles and was too sweet but ok to have with rice .

MANCHURIAN CHICKEN - This was a spicy Chicken made with chilli gravy base and had soft generous pieces of Chicken and was a good choice to have with both noodles and rice .

After trying these food i was full but something was missing in this eating spead and it was just very ordinary i felt and nothing special however quantity is good and once a while you can give this place a try .

This is a small joint and have been there quite some time. Very nice and tasty food for the price range. Tried again yesterday. They have opened a roll counter which is offering rolls and moghlai paratha. Tried both and loved them. Should try their Chinese if you are in the area. Quite different from the food served in the locality.

I ordered crispy chicken which is not at all crispy :( . The rate is  quite lesser than any other good tasty restaurants.  I will not recommend this restaurant and will not go there again. ....
