Below standard Biriyani, they serve rotten food mostly. Best avoided and don't waste your money. Why they still running such a 3rd grade food takeaway ?? Never try to visit this place  if your really Love food

The worst of the branches, i have never eaten such a pathetic biryani ever. The chicken was literally picked from the gravy pieces and put in before serving
The duckbunglow dhakai is way better

Being a devotee of Lucknow biryani and a fan of Kolkata biryani, the idea of Dhaka biryani did not get my vote at first, However my dad insisted to taste it. Got it parceled and while opening the package, the first impression was not at all happening. Instead of white flowery rice with hints of saffron, what we got was brownish rice, evenly coloured. Needless to mention that I was disappointed, however had to change my mind after having the first spoonful. The aroma was subtle. The taste was very different, yet very pleasing. Had the biggest chunk of mutton in a biryani plate, even. I was sceptical if the meat was properly cooked, as the piece was so good. However, to my surprise, it was thoroughly cooked and amazingly tender. I would definitely add Dhaka biryani to my list of favourite biryanis.

Every time when we have a party in our office, we order home delivery from here!
Biriyani, both Mutton & Chicken are very delicious but a bit low in quantity! 
Chicken Chap is also tasty but who do not prefer spicy food,this is actually not an ideal place for them!

If you are a biriyani lover then you should visit this restaurant once. You will have two options. Mutton or chicken biriyani.  I love the mutton biriyani.  Also chicken Chap is also available. But I didn't try that. Here mutton biriyani would cost 140/-plate. But the price is reasonable as per the taste and quality. Only cons is cash payment.
