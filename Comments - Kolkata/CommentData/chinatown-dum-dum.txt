Being dear friends with the owners of their new franchise, it thus gives me immense taste to proudly say that the food is Yumm. With opening up in the north sector region, it definitely stands out from the other delicacies around. Even though being just take away, there are multiple options for you to get your food if youâ€™re in the nearest deliverable distance. 

Recommendations : Golden Fried Fish, Golden Fried Prawn Tossed, Steamed Momos, Drums of Heaven & much more. If you find starters dry, Ask for #Chinatown Special #TOSS. 

Must Try !!
