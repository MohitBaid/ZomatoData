As a fast food corner its quite popular. Food is well served. Quantity is more than decent. I use to eat there while in college. Staffs are friendly. Lots of customized Rolls available. I quite like the Veg roll and Tikia roll here. They use to be my favorite. The location makes this fast food corner a center of attraction. Most of the time its crowded. All most all of the items that are listed available all the time.
