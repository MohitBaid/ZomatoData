Brilliant biriyani...Includes 2 pieces of chicken and an egg with a quite good amount of rice...And the rice is of good quality And the dish is also not very rich and spicy...Though the seating arrangement is not satisfactory but it serves heart touching biriyani...

Hi Guys...

Came to know about this biryani junction from one newspaper where they have put some 10 places in Kolkata where biryani is good...There was name like #Arsalan #Aminia #Shiraz #Hanglatherium

With due respect to that reporter I would like to say that this restaurant is not at all in the same category, not even one or two level lower....This is just a place where you can have biryani at cheaper price...Yes that's it....In today's date where @arsalan and @aminia sells biryani with a price tag of INR 190 for normal biryani, this guys sells at only INR 100 for full plate and only INR 50 for half plate...Price is awesome if someone is only concerned about price 

Now let me come to ambience... It's just horrible compared to those big guys... It's a small stall on footpath where hygiene is compromised at least I think so...Even they serve food in normal steel plate where foods are always reached the periphery and drops down from there and hence got unhygienic... Portion size is ok or rather good at this price...I am attaching photos also

Now about taste...I read some reviews where people compared this with @shiraz...I am sorry boss, this is not even half of the taste so just don't expect something tasty here...I have taken mutton biryani and chicken chaap....Biryani was ok type but chaap was altogether a third class stuffs...I have never tasted such a low quality chaap, even I prepare better chicken chaap in homeðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

Overall I can say this is ideal place for college going people or those people who wants to have lunch at INR 50... Really in today's market these people are doing incredible job by providing biryani at INR 50 ONLY...

Guys please don't misunderstand me...I am not saying that don't go there...Plz visit and let me know whether I am right or wrong

@Khaza Biryani people... Please take this feedback as a constructive feedback and do better...Will visit again if your taste improves

Heard a lot about this place, finally got a chance to taste their biriyani. The chicken was very well done, very tasty. The rice was okayish, but worth the money. Half place is sufficient for one person.

Biryani is nice here....the mutton pieces are always soft and the quantity very good. Also the price is low....which makes it recommendable!!

Don't judge this place by its appearance. Their Biryani is extremely tasty and can give any place a run for their money.Â  They give 2pcs of chicken or mutton and also an egg in a full plate @Rs100 only. Although they have got a liitle bit of seating arrangements but its neither comfortable nor hygienic. They have got other items as well like chicken kasha and chap but they aren't as good as their biryani. I would recommend all the biryani lovers out their to visit this place at least once and share their views. Thank you.

Didn't think Khaza would be listed on Zomato.Â 
Its slightly difficult to find if you are new, and sitting on the table laid footpath isn't something great. But, hey, people love street food and this defines it completely.

Now, coming to the food. The Biryani - Mutton and chicken is well done. It smells nice and tastes good as well. The chicken chaap is very good.

Not somewhere I would like to sit and eat to, but definitely somewhere to order and take home.

our local biryani masterchef.the biryani is quite good and have its signature taste.only reason not providing 5 out of 5 is their mutton is not up to the mark.its quite hard and rubbery.dont know its marination problem or cooking time problem(less time),however if you are particular about mutton,and dont want to try mutton belive me their alu/anda biryani is fully worth of.also the service man is quite helpful though and serves the mutton pieces you choose.their chiken kathi kabab and rolls are also of very very good quality.mutton kassa is not good.

while i was in class 9 10 i took coaching from pathfinder educational centre . this place is situated right in front of their new building . a small place with sitting arrangement right under the sun . so its better to have a take away . they serve an average quality biryani Â at low price and a good quantity . i have tasted only their chicken and mutton biryani and nothing else . a good street biryani joint
