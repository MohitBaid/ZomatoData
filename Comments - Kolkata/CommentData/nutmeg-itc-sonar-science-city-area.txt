A small pastry shop located on the left corner while entering to the ITC sonar hotel. Visited last week. However, the taste of chicken kish and cheese cream cake did not meet my expectation. But the blue berry muffin and choco chips muffin - i would recommend muffin overs one of the best in the city of joy. Compared to other 5 star pastry shop, the prices were reasonable @Nutmeg.

One of the ever-reliable places to pick up a treat from - been going there ever since Chef Harpawan initiated me into their many treats - my favourite would be their chocolate mousse cake - and the good news is, they can always customize cakes as per your liking. They also make specialties during christmas and easter, and is definitely worth checking out.

A tiny space within a Mega property, serving lip smacking Pastries and Bakes..... the outlet in-charge was extremely polite and courteous..... Had ordered Red Velvet Pastry, Chicken Quiche, Chicken Patties and Tuna Patties....It was worth very penny spent, the patties being the show stopper....The interiors are very well done inspite of it being a Lilliput when compared to its neighboring joints within the property....The only con being the limited supply....For example...they make only 2 velvet pastries a day.... this goes for all the other items too.... So, incase you visit in a big group, there can be multiple disappointments.....
Overall, would surely recommend it .....

Located en route to PAN Asian down the main outside lobby in ITC Sonar,Kolkata is Nutmeg nestled in one quiet and insignificant corner.

This place was known predominantly for chocolates and pattisaries even before the concept of Fabelle came up.

The cakes are one of its kind so are the milk,butterscotch and dark chocolates.

The front sales desk is highly experienced, well informed and innovatively trained professionals and readily provides guest information on gourmet delight and things to eat and taste from Nutmeg.

Best in its class compared to anywhere in the city, this place is a little expensive but the money is 
worth spending.

I would request the management to house this next to Fabelle for greater visibility and sales.

Nutmeg is a small confectionery shop inside ITC that sells varieties of pastries at very affordable prices. Food is delish and the luxurious setting gives your mood a fancy touch. Full marks for Nutmeg!

This is a cafe and a bakery of the ITC sonar bangla hotel. The bakery though not very popular serves good and innovative cakes, cupcakes and muffins.

Had ordered a Mud Cake / Mousse Cake over phone. The time which I had mentioned for pickup, the cake was neatly packed in the bag ready. 

When we had the cake, it was fabulous with the mousse very smooth. The Crumbs at the bottom was a good break from the smoothness of the cake.

Definitely recommend.

I've had the privilege of having their desserts almost everyday for a stretch of 2 months during my internship at ITC Sonar. 
They make good cakes & cheesecakes but the taste is nothing extraordinary. Savories are also decent but  there's much room for improvement.
