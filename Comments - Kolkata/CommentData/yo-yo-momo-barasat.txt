I was looking to get food delivered. It was quiet late around 10 pm. I found yo yo momo and thought of giving it a try. I ordered one plate of egg chicken haka noodles along with semi-gravy chili chicken. The bill was cheaper than I was expecting. The home delivery service was good. I got the food delivered to my place around 10:40. The food was good and the quantity was good enough to feed 2 people. It was worth my money.
Recently I ordered a cream chicken which was tasty too

So,this place is not too far from my place, we order egg Hakka noodles and chili chicken.The quantity and quality of noodles is very good I must say that. But I am little disappointed with the chili chicken,they were pale and chicken was not at all tender.
Yes I will again order from this place for my noodles craving.

The eatery is a small one, but they serve very yummy and delicious Chinese. I ordered pan fried Momo, Gravy noodles and haka noodles and was extremely satisfied with the Taste, quality and quantity. I will definitely return again for good food and also recommend them to others.

Got one of the best and delicious food corner " yo yo momo" in madhyamgram near railway station. Pals, they are serving the mouth watering dishes including some of them that I ordered like Chicken drums and heaven, both chicken and veg momo. I also like their gravy noodles. Most important thing,they serve all dishes hot, even you opt for a home delivery. Quality of food is very good. I lovef and relish the food very much .
