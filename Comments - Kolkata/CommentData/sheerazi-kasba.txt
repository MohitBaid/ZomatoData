Please don't dare to visit this restaurant. Awfully bad, inedible and undercooked food. I had a fish fry and prawn chowmein. The fish fry was okay but fried a little longer than expected. The chowmein is a total disappointment - overspiced with under cooked smelly prawns and vegetables. Altogether totally bad. Avoid at all cost.

they make good rolls too..they are huge and quite loaded with filling..

About 5 mins from Dolna Day School.This is basically a place for take away.I tried Chicken butter masala and Chicken do piaza both were nice.Ordered the chicken biryani on another day.It wasn't that good.Prices are quite cheap.

Worst experience ever. Ordered online for two  3 chicken chowmien, they send me chicken chow without any chicken.......Taste was crap. After having some of it, I throw it away.

Its a street food joint near the Kasba P.O. I ordered their egg chow. The quantity was good and the quality was also satisfying. It was little bit spicy, I think it was made with some kind of sauce as it was looking red in colour. Overall it was good and also pocket friendly. Looking forward to try out their other items..

Take away place.. 
My suggestion : do not even date to try this outlet out. Worst food corner in Kasba locality i must say.
I asked them if they have "fish kabitati" available, it wasn't though they told that they will make it. That's fine. It was not listed in their menu and they charged 130/- for the worst fish kabitati i ever tasted. Along with rolls, biriyani... Very bad quality. Very bad. If you do not have any option left then do not eat but do not visit this place ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜–

Have had their chowmein many a times and wasn't disappointed with their quality or quantity, but I never got 4 packs of Biriyani(chicken/mutton) after 9 p.m. Even though their biriyani is good, I would prefer customers to travel a few more yards towards the station and buy Biriyani from Hena(Raaz) Biriyani(cheaper Chk @65). And Chilli Chicken,Tandoori Roti,Roomali Roti from Luxmi Caterer on the same way to Hema Biriyani or towards station,you won't be disappointed and yes, it would be cheaper. Just one problem,there is too much of smell of their spices which would burn your noses and make you cough. Its really hot there as well. And that spicy essence disturbs even when you pass by. But its a fair deal.

Do FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEWS. I WILL POST HONEST REVIEWS AND PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT INTENTIONALLY
