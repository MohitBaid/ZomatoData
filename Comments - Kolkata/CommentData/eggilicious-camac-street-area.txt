Its almost a regular joint for me. Highly suggested for people who have their office near wood street and hungerford street, as it is a pocket friendly joint with good food. Only downside is their small space, though it is nicely decorated.
Recommendation: 
1. Eggtastic Burger
2. Mughlai Paratha
3. All of their combos (specially Indian ones) for nice lunch.
4. Double egg and chicken roll.

There are thousands of options for Chienese lover, hundreds of options for Bengali cuisines lover, but what's about specifically for egg lovers?
Yes, Eggilicious comes for the egg lovers as a blessing! Egg + Delicious = Eggilicious!
Been there few days ago! The restaurant located near to the Vardhan Market. A small restaurant serving delicious food based on egg!
I ordered -
1. Moghlai Paratha - I ordered this item by taking the suggestion of the restaurant owner! Usually the Moghlai Paratha serves in squared shape but they served it differently! They cut the whole paratha in four pieces and served with Aloo grevy and pickles! The paratha was fully stuffed with small pieces of egg scramble! But somehow I feel the paratha too dry!
2. Lemon Tea - As it was a rainy evening, so I ordered this item! The tea was good with mild lemon flavour! Perfect Accompany for the rainy day!
3. Spanish Omelette - Two egg were used, with boiled potatoes and onions to make the huge omelette! The omelette was served with bread toast, mashed potato, french fries! The omelette were tasty in nature and it gies excellent wuth the other item served along with it! Love the dish!

In conclusion, I'll say, this one is one the pocket friendly restaurant in Camac Street area! With limited seating capacity, the restaurant serves good egg based item! Overall good dining experience!

A small little place on Camac Street, true to its name is all about eggs! As small as it is, their food is excellent and prepared with care. The service is very prompt. I tasted the Egg Bun on their menu and it was of incredible taste. Not a huge fan of scrambled eggs because it's not done properly in most cases, I was absolutely satisfied with the scrambled egg filling between the buns with the right amount of cheese to make it soft! .Definitely going to revisit this restaurant.

I have been to this place twice now, I go there to grab a quick bite ad it is near my home. The food is not oily and looks healthy. There is no gimmicks just good food and well thought out menu. The place is good for grabbing a quick bite and not feel guilty about it. They give toast and fries along with the egg dishes so that is a bonus. Overall the dishes are filling and healthy.

Food - All about egg! This egg based outlet is doing wonders. All kinds of eggitarian dishes are served. Taste and quality to the mark. We ordered for the Full English Breakfast. It is a platter serving serving toasts, boiled egg, sunny side up, 2 chicken sausages, kidney beans, mushroom roast and tomato roast. Along with it went for the juice if the day which had mango lassi and watermelon juice. All the 3 were worth tasting. 

Ambience - This is a cute little place managing a maximum of 20 people. 

Service - The uncle serving you is very helpful and such nice behaviour. The aunty at the counter is also sweet. 

Rates - Absolutely worth it! Cheap and enjoyable.

My office is located next door in Camac Street and Eggilicious is one of the faves for lunch. It is hygiene, affordable, comfortable and the food is not greasy. The Mughai paratha deserves a special mention. Unlike usual Mughlai parathas (which I avoid), this is not oily at all. The omelettes are great as well. Juices are fresh & cold pressed without any sugar. Apart from eggs, they serve chicken as well. The chicken curry with rice is good. Only flipside is the limited seating space.

It is a small place at Camac Street, and is definitely not the one for big parties. I've visited them twice during lunch, and fortunately found an empty table both time.

Coming to the food, the first time I ordered Paneer Bhurji with 2 parathas, and second time it was mushroom and cheese omelette. The presentation of the food was simple, yet elegant. However, it is a request to the place to use wheat flour for the parathas. Paneer tasted fresh and worth ordering again. 
The omelette was served with two buttered toasts, French fries and a smiley. This place is cheap compared to the quantity and quality of food they offer. Overall I am happy with the food. 

The ambience was nice with kind of minimalist design being followed.
The server was polite, and offered water and menu as soon as I sat down.

Liked the overall experience, and definitely worth visiting again.

So I was passing by and hungry for lunch - this place looked quite nice, so decided to drop in (although it's quite small). Ordered a chicken curry and paratha - it arrived quite quickly, and the taste was great. The paratha was actually cut up into little little slices, donno why, but still - a great touch. The portion of the chicken was...pretty good I would say - it costed less than ONE FIFTY (143, to be exact), I think it's simply not possible to give more for that price. Although - it's been a while since I've eaten at KFC (one of which, incidentally, is not too far away from this place) - but I seem to remember THEM giving TWO pieces, one big leg piece and one breast for about 150, sans fries or drink. But that was a while ago, and in any case, KFC's pricing is weird - they WON'T GIVE YOU *just* two pieces, you HAVE to take a "meal", without the option of skipping the fries or drink. Just to let you know. And I've got sick eating there as well - multinational coporation my ass.
Anyway, all this went well - until I FINISHED the meal, and realised THERE WAS NO PLACE TO WASH MY HANDS!! The guy said "paani hai - bahar jana parega". Wow! I wasn't expecting *this*. Also - in the middle of this, some people wandered in, and coolly sat down AT MY TABLE (though facing the other way) - without even *asking* for my permission! The guy at the desk didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with this, let alone tell them to get out!! The only place I've seen this before is in the "thali" restaurants down in Tamil Nadu - like, the absolute *cheapest*, *shittiest* ones! That's when I realised this place was for ANIMALS! Never gonna go back there again. I mean, bara babu who spends money on ACs and nice decor and doesn't put in a *BASIN* (which even *Delights*, round the corner, has), is in need of a LUNATIC ASYLUM, not the cash in my wallet! And is also not there to throw out ¬†people like that!!
Shame really, cause the food was good.
                    

UPDATE, PLEASE READ: OK, I just had BAD case of tummy problems!! - they must have put in some nasty stuff or substandard cooking material or something into the food!! We all know how unscrupulous these people are - heh, if you paid 200 or 300, even THEN something like this could have happened, for 150 - you should just come back from the restaurant and go straight inside the toilet!! :) I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING ABOVE!! NEVER *EVER* GO HERE!! KILL THIS GUY- NOW!!

We were four girls who went there and all of us just instantly fell in love with the presentation of the food and its taste. A must visit for everyone who wishes to have a quick bite in Camac Street! English Breakfast tops the list followed by Mushroom and Cheese Omelette and Eggtastic Cheese Maggi 
I look forward to visit again and suggest the place to my friends.

This place is ideal as a breakfast joint. Tried the omlettes which they serve with toast and a potato smiley. The English platter seems good but we wanted something lighter. We ordered 2 plain omlettes and 1 cheese omelette and watermelon juice. Somehow I liked the cheese omlette more than the plain one. Neat and tidy place. Would recommend this place if you are in camac street area and are looking for a breakfast joint.

First of all the place is new and lives up to the expectation of omelette. I am a fan of omelettes so have it a try. The place is very well decorated and the owner is pretty friendly. Tried the eggtastic burger and it was really very good. The omelette was properly fried and each bite did give me a taste of egg, mushroom and the mayonese. Also tried a new dish not yet available on the menu, dosti roti and reshmi tikka kabab. It was fabulous. Had a good chat with Mrs. Kavita during our munching time and she was very friendly. Just one suggestion if you could be a little reasonable with the price. Else good place to visit for an hour or so. Visited with

Hey Guys,

The only food I like when it comes to "Egg" is Omelette and there cant be so better place than this. Be it classic omelette or masala omelette or Mushroom Cheese Omelette, it makes you feel on top of the world with the first bite.¬†

Situated in wood street, easily placed with friendly staff, the only con is that the place is too small to accommodate 10 or more at a time.¬†

Bingo !

Located opposite to Saturday Club or just a few meters from stun the sun. Small joint. Staff are friendly and helpful. Went for English Breakfast it was just simply awesome and delightful both quality and taste wise.
Though there was a stupid incident. Other customers were there, as we were having English Breakfast at 6 o' clock in the evening they became judgemental and were passing comments which was annoying some people are ignorant fools anyway they got a good response from us, bunch of idiotic corporate fools.They were extremely lucky they did not get thrashed ( there is a pic of that fool looking straight at the camera). Anyway coming to the joint it is neatly decorated and almost all of the items are wonderful.

Eggilicious is a tiny eatery tucked in a corner along Wood Street in Camac Street Area. Despite its sparse accommodation, this place is cozy and bright. Since i'm not a big fan of eggs, it was on a friend's recommendation that I decided to pay a visit. It certainly is a haven for egg lovers in pursuit of a great breakfast.

I was surprised to see their menu consisting of widespread options ranging from different kinds of omelettes and basic solo breakfast inclusions to sandwiches and crepes. I tried their grilled egg-chicken sandwich and being the sort of person to indulge in a drink with even the slightest of meals, I tried their watermelon juice.¬†
The juice was fresh and refreshing and the sandwich ¬†was healthy and tasty.¬†

A slightly quicker service is expected with the eatery gaining prominence. A decent place to grab a a quick bite.

This lovely restaurant is located at one of the corners of Woodstreet lane, a few minutes walk from Camac Street Pantaloons or more precisely opposite to the Saturday club. Went there for breakfast with my sister at around 9AM. The decor is really cute and gave us a feeling, like we were seating inside an egg. The white and yellow combination of the entire joint made us felt like that. Coming to food we had ordered their full english breakfast, egg cheese sandwich and juice of the day (sweet lime). The full english breakfast consisted of 2 toast, 1 omlette, 1 boiled egg, 2 sausages, baked beans with fried tomato, smashed potato, mushrooms and aloo tikki. The entire breakfast was enough for each one of us. As we were very hungry we ordered egg cheese sandwich after the breakfast. Egg cheese sandwich was truly amazing with the cheese oozing out. Prices are very reasonable. Staffs were courteous too. Overall had a great experience.

Went there for lunch as I'm an eggie lover and this is just next to my office. It's a good small place for a quick eat. Even if the menu here is limited it doesn't matter if you like whatever they have as what I ate was really made well and sumptuous- egg roll, egg mushroom cheese Maggi. The lady taking orders of customers here is quite sweet as well. Would definitely be going again for quick eggie lunches :)
            
Update: Went there couple of more times and had the burger, anda bhurji, Mughlai paratha and egg bun along with fresh juices (of course Im not Jughead so ate the items in different visits). Really liked them all and I hope they continue to maintain and listen to all the feedback positively. I told them to start being open till late on Saturday night as lot of young people would enjoy late night snacking post partying. Also they are going to be starting anda curry and rice soon cant wait :)

When you walk in at this place the first thing you are going to experience that you are inside an Egg. While talking about egg this place is mainly and specialized in making Egg Dishes for your Breakfast, lunch as well as evening snacks. This place has what it called the complete adaption of Egg with the entire ambiance is of the Egg color with White which signifies Egg White and Yellow which signifies the Egg York. Its really very interesting to see these new concepts coming up at the Camac street Area zone with some delightful and egg crave killer.¬†
Came to this place with few of my friends after hearing a ¬†lot from my old time buddy Shahbaaz Zaman¬† who was really impressed with this place. When stepped in it really felt good when welcomed with a smile on the face by the manager of the place Ms. Madhu. Taken the seats and instantly ¬†we had the menu in our hands. So here are the things which we tried as follows.

DRINKS:
Pineapple Juice, Cucumber & Mint Juice as well as Watermelon Juice. : All the three drinks were fresh and very refreshing. i personally liked the pineapple one as it is one of my favourite. Cucumber juice really pulled it off with the great and complete flavor of cucumber and a hint of mint in it. Watermelon looked complete red and it was like eating a watermelon. Impressed!!

FOOD:
Hard Boiled Eggs : First on the table we decided to get the raw thing so it was hard boiled egg which is the main charm and good for the protein part. Looked cute as it was cut down from center with coriander leaves over it as well as small amount of black pepper over it.

Mushroom & Cheese Omelet : A full made omelet with a generous chunks of Mushroom and cheese inside it. Served with toasted bread and two type of sauces. Decoration of the dish kept simple so that the dish can shout out for itself with the taste. It was firmly made, softer and delicious with the bread.¬†

Spanish Omelet : When it comes to Spanish omelet i get into two minds as i had some bad experience with the Spanish ones. Thou the expectations was intact and when the dish arrived i have all sort of relax. Pan size omelet served with potato fry and toasted breads. The omelet was deeply fried with potatoes inside as well and onions for sure. Fillings were really impressive and tasted superb.

Eggtastic cheese Maggi : Maggie is one of my favorite and when it comes with Egg then its a cherry on the cake. It was not an ordinary dish as you expect this is a stunner of a Maggie with mushrooms, capsicum, tomatoes, onions, scrambled eggs and cheese in and out. It really stole the show for a moment.

Grilled Egg Cheese Sandwich : Sandwich with grilled bread and in between mashed eggs with the flavour of cheese thats gives something to cheer about. All sort of varieties at one place.¬†

Eggtastic Burger : Oh Mine! i just fell in love with the presentation. Wonderfully done i must say. With the base of mushroom and lettuce and kept on the cheese at the bottom the heart shaped egg won it over there. Full marks for the presentation. Thou it was hard to eat at one shot but i enjoyed the burger through out the last bite. Recommended

Mughlai Paratha : They not only believes in making stuffs which are available in shops and cafes but it was all surprise when saw the Mughlai paratha too in ¬†the menu. That was a big shocker for us and the dish didn't disappointed as well.¬†

Savoury ¬†Crepe : All the dishes were doing a fantastic job but got a bit little disappointed with this one. Filled with Mushroom, spinach, parley and cheese. The quantity of spinach was too much which turned the things wrong as well as it was a little salty.

French Toast : One of my favourite from the childhood. It really took me 20 years back. Classic french toast with maple syrup. It was soft sweet and tasty. Recommended.

Sweet Crepe : Finally ending things up with a sweet dish. I love sweets so big expectations from this one and it didn't turned me down. The goodness of nutella inside and chocolate syrup over the top. ¬†Perfect.

It was a great Eggilicious experience over here and loved all their dishes. And to be mention the service was good and the treatment with the customers are very friendly indeed. Prices are way affordable than you expect. Overall this new place is going to make a huge impact in the coming days. I wish Team Eggilicious all the very best for the future. Cheers!

Looking for an eggcellent place to eat? Well, look no further. Camac Street brings to you the eggiest place in town: you name the dish, they'll have it.

Eggilicious is a small, cozy place to eat out. Specializing in egg dishes, this place serves you from a proper English breakfast to even a chicken egg roll. While variety in what they specialize does win our hearts, so does the warm nature of the management team. Although this place has a limited sitting area, I personally believe it only makes the place more ideal for spending quality time and making special memories with your loved ones.

Tucked away in Wood street, this quaint little cafe is a new member in the food map of Kolkata!

It is really a tiny eatery with 4 small round tables. 

Ambience: Well, the space is sooo tiny and quaint that if you speak at normal decibels, you'll hear your own voice echoing. So, the two of us were almost whispering as it felt kinda weird!

We ordered:

Mughlai paratha :

 75 bucks a plate consisting of a mughlai paratha cut into 4 pieces served with 'aaloo', onion slices and a lemon wedge.

Well, being a Calcuttan, I'm used to eating roadside unhealthy mughlai parathas absolutely drenched in oil, but this one here was not at all oily. That is what I loved about this one. Also the 'aloo' was very tasty. The filling of the paratha could have been a bit more.

Eggstastic burger :

75 bucks a plate consisting of a burger, some store-bought fries and 2 types of ketchup(sweet and hot).

This burger is okayish, definitely not worth the hype. I'll tell you why because I make similar sandwiches at home and mine taste waaay better.

First of all, the yolk should be runny, not the egg white as well. 

Secondly, addition of dried oregano will enhance the flavour. Trust me, I've tried. Without any sort of herbs, its plain flavourless. Just egg and bread.

Thirdly, grill it a bit more so that the cheese slice melts. Or, use other cheese variants apart from Amul.

This burger will definitely leave your hands and mouth with raw eggy smell which I hate.

Upside is this eatery is quite pocket friendly, but everything you get here can be made at home easily. so don't expect anything extraordinary!

And yes, they do charge addition tax@14.5%

Ambience: Well, the space is sooo tiny and quaint that if you speak at normal decibels, you'll hear your own voice echoing. So, the two of us were almost whispering as it felt kinda weird!

We ordered:

Mughlai paratha :

 75 bucks a plate consisting of a mughlai paratha cut into 4 pieces served with 'aaloo', onion slices and a lemon wedge.

Well, being a Calcuttan, I'm used to eating roadside unhealthy mughlai parathas absolutely drenched in oil, but this one here was not at all oily. That is what I loved about this one. Also the 'aloo' was very tasty. The filling of the paratha could have been a bit more.

Eggstastic burger :

75 bucks a plate consisting of a burger, some store-bought fries and 2 types of ketchup(sweet and hot).

This burger is okayish, definitely not worth the hype. I'll tell you why because I make similar sandwiches at home and mine taste waaay better.

First of all, the yolk should be runny, not the egg white as well. 

Secondly, addition of dried oregano will enhance the flavour. Trust me, I've tried. Without any sort of herbs, its plain flavourless. Just egg and bread.

Thirdly, grill it a bit more so that the cheese slice melts. Or, use other cheese variants apart from Amul.

This burger will definitely leave your hands and mouth with raw eggy smell which I hate.

Upside is this eatery is quite pocket friendly, but everything you get here can be made at home easily. so don't expect anything extraordinary!

And yes, they do charge addition tax@14.5%

I absolutely loved the place! Since I'm a vegetarian, I was thinking I won't have too many options to choose from but that is not true! The Aloo cheese roll, the desserts and crepes and fresh juice are all excellent and a must try! 

Also I loved the d√©cor. It's a small cute cafe and they management has utilised the space judiciously. The welcome was very warm and overall service was excellent. 

All the best ‚ù§

A perfect joint for a good working breakfast or lunch. Though not wide but a decent variety of options to chose from for all egg lovers. An welcome option for the early office comers at Camac Street area. But good for takeaways as the place is pretty small, though clean and decently made up.

Tucked in a cosy corner opposite The Saturday Club, on Wood Street, Eggilicious is a gastronomist's delight. Think of eggs and the myriad forms it can take, and lo and behold, you have it in front of you, cooked to perfection. And while you savour the delicacies, the effervescent ambience completely bowls you over. Eggilicious is a  cute outlet, with 6 covers, so expect to wait for your turn. So if you are around Camacho Street and hungry, you know where to go. 
PS: try out the moghlai paratha and the watermelon juice. Did I say heavenly. Yes, it truly is.

Came here this evening absolutely hungry and since my friend recommend me this place I gave it a thought to try this place out. As u can see from my rating which I've given 5 I was really really amazed and happy as to what this place had to offer. Starting with the ambience which is small nice n cosy. Everything here is egg and the best part is that they serve the egg dishes r served with toasted and mashed potatoes. I had soft boiled eggs which were cooked perfectly then I had the scrambled egg with cheese ,toast and mashed potatoes absolutely yummy after which I ate an eggtastic burger. The eggtastic burger was really really filling and the egg in that is a fat layer of fried egg served between lettuce and burger.the watermelon juice was fresh with no added sugar and if the health conscience customers want just the egg white that is provided as well.Lastly the owner is really friendly and her suggestions were on point. Ty eggilicious for the wonderful experience will definetly come back soon.

Eggilicious is the new haven for egg lovers. This small eatery on 6, Wood Street lives up to its name on the interiors front also.
From the chandelier to the seating to the decor, everything is inspired by the egg spell.
I personally loved the seating and the warm welcome I received when I entered.

I occupied a cute eggy table and ordered:

Fresh pressed juice of the day ( watermelon it was)
Mushroom and cheese omelette
French toast

I was surprised at the quantity considering the pricing. It's pretty good. Pricing is very reasonable.
Presentation gets a thumbs up. The watermelon juice was served in a bulb and the omelette was perfectly done served with 2 buttered toasts, mashed potatoes and condiments.

I simply loved this place in every aspect . Egg lovers a must visit. There are few options like
beans on toast, aloo cheese rolls for the vegetarians also.

The cold pressed juice was healthy and fresh and use of ice and sugar is totally avoided

I had a good experience while being at this place. The management is quite concerned about the customer and very communicative too. I am a vegetarian and choose not to eat onion and garlic. I was accompanying two staunch non vegetarians who had placed their food order. I spoke to the owners and asked them if they had anything for me. The courteous owners recommended couple of good dishes to me and I chose to go for baked beans with toast. The taste of the food was exceptional. I would suggest people visiting this place to try their juice of the day. I @had watermelon juice and was forced to have another glass of the same.
The ambience is vibrant and the seating arrangement is comfortable too.

That Eggtastic Burger though üòç. Finally a proper place to cater to the needs of egg lovers. My friend had a mushroom & cheese omlette & a cold press juice in their cute bulb shape glass and it was out of this world. A must visit. AWESOME
