The quality is bad..n i mean realy bad even road side stalls servers more tasty foods.. we ordered Drums of heaven , noodles n chickn Manchurian...was disapointed with the served iteam.. Now coming to the staff ...ders is one guy named Azhar i ges he is the manager over der.. the guy has his own attitude he wil treat u like its ITC Sonar n u r even lucky to get a seat in the place and the remeaning stuff are not trained to serve n behave properly... i had 2 take my card n pay in the cash counter cz after giving me the bill no1 was attending me to swipe my card..

Went to the open air one beside the house boat.. the ambience was good, ordered mix platter of different kinds of cutlet , cold drinks, coffee and sweet lassi. While nothing to say about cold drinks, the lassi was good, coffee average and the cutlet filling was same for all different kind of cutlets.. egg devil, mutton cutlet , prawn cutlet and chicken one all tasted same. Not happy with the food. But good place to sit around and chat in evening.

I gave this rating only for the ambience of the place. The food served here has very cheap quality specially when you consider the price. Please visit this place at least for once to indulge in the serene beauty.
We just had evening snacks here with tea. The oil they used for frying snacks was simply irritating. Neither the tea had any class. Not much options present for vegetarians.
Conclusively, I loved the ambience but due to monopoly, the food quality is highly degraded.

The reason I rate this place so high is solely for it's ambience. It suits for all occasions and with all types of company. The place is screamingly beautiful. You can escape for a romantic date or take your family for a day outing. The food served here is good but not excellent and the pricing is on the higher side. This one's located between Cafe Ekante and the floating restaurant.

If planning for a romantic date or a quick break away from the bustling cacophonic routine, this Place would be your soul healer!  Situated right in the middle of a lake on a island it is dangerously beautiful.  The quiet and serene atmosphere all around will lift you up to a all new level of romantic thrill. When it comes to food it is even better!  Murg jhaal lonka tikka and nolen gurer payesh should be a must in your order list.  Definetly a place you cannot afford to miss and to me it is one of the best restaurant i have been in recent times.. Also make sure if you are coming in a cab ask him to drop you at the bridge..

With a lovely open air ambiance this place is located inside the Eco tourism park cafe ekante island area. Among several other restaurant areas this is their open air section where you can enjoy the cool breeze sitting on peral white chair table with some hot or cold beverages mainly according to me.
Came here on couple of occasion and enjoyed a cuo of coffee along with french fries. Though thetvtasted very average but really enjoyed the ambiance here.
