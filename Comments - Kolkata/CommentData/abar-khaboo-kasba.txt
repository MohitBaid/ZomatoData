Got a chicken roll from here a few days back and found it to he below average. 
Service time 10minutes. Behavior is good.

The roll was soggy and the paratha was thin and soft and wasn't holding it's shape upright so had problems in holding. Brought it back home and split in to pieces for efficiency. 

Improvement needed.

Ordered for a chicken chowmein from Abar Khaboo today. The chowmein was nicely made. Quantity was more than sufficient. Came for just 50 bucks. Loved it!

This extremely cheap food outlet sells brilliant moglais and prawn chowmin.
Must try this pocket friendly place when you're around this place.
Also, rolls start for as low as Rs 20/- !

No ratings for ambience cleanliness decorations comfort or staff courtesy etc etc.
But you just taste their plain tarka or egg tarka and roomali rotis. They are so delicious and authentic.. you will love them. Take them home and eat them hot. You will definitely come back the next week if not the next day..

This place is just a hole in the wall kind of an eatery that basically serves street food such as kebabs, fish fries and rolls. I was unfortunate enough to come across this joint during my evening walk. I was surprised to see the ambiance. Just outside the place, the footpath is encroached by gamblers playing cards who have taken up any possible seating space. Anyways, I ordered a Chicken Roll which was prepared in the utmost unhygienic condition. The guy preparing the roll was a heavy smoker and kept on smoking while making rolls and coughing directly on the roll. Their small kitchen was filled with cigarette smoke because of that stupid guy.

Finally I received the roll which had a strong cigarette smell, thanks to the guy again. The roll had barely five pieces of chicken kebab and was not at all spicy despite adding sauces.
