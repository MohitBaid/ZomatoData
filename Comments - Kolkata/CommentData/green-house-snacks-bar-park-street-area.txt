This is an extremely economic joint located just a stone throw from park circus 7 point.....I wouldn't say that they serve the most delicious food in the locality but considering the pricing it is not disappointing at all....They make tasty chaats and moderately delicious fried rice and noodle...However, the chili chicken is a Mood spoiler...Overall, can give a shot....

OH MY GOD ! Hats off to Zomato ! I never expected to see this listing here. This is sheer nostalgia. I First stumbled upon this place when our school car pool hat a flat tire outside it and we were hungry and we had a dosa. 

This became our favorite chat place as children and we stopped here after school with friends... The glass shelf always had Raj kachoris neatly stacked and the singhara used to be yummy as well .This is a shop locate a the corner to the lane next to Park Sweets. 

Had completely forgotten about it and now i need to go refresh my childhood memories again soon . The food was never brilliant but it was always fresh and the raj kachoris were always crisp and the curd was always fresh . It is very easy on the pocket.
