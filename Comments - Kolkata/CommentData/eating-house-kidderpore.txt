Being a student of Army Institute of Management, the late night hungers are of usual basis and then you come across this restaurant open till 4 o'clock in the morning which serves as our appetite satisfaction. Yes the food quality isnt great but the quantity is of wholesale kind. Nothing to cheer for this restaurant except the late night deliveries.

Rating 4 only on the basis of food and its pocket friendly. If you want the dhaba style food this can be a good option and best part its open late night. My pick is butter roti chicken bharta and double egg tadka with onion salad.

Cheap food that fills your tummy - nothing more nothing less. Food is coocked with a lot of oil and spices, other than that its a good enough dhaba. Its on diamond harbour road, near my college. :)

This is not really a proper restaurant, but I would say a good enough pocket friendly eatery and is probably better than most others in this genre. The egg tarka and the mutton kassa are worth a try. Not a classy joint, but the food is not so bad either. A so-so experience for me.

this is a   road side dhaba  cum shack  NOT a  restaurant , however if you live near diamond harbour road & you are hungry during day time you can definitely visit this SHACK  , but a note of caution  DON'T TAKE  ALONG  ANY FEMALE FRIENDS OR RELATIVES TO THIS PLACE  ,  THEY MAY GET CATCALLS  or WHISTLES  ...  coming to food try  out all  the Mutton  dishes  , namely  mutton kassa  , mutton korma  , mutton masala  with naan  ...  i had a sumptuous lunch in this place a few days back  &  the bill  was  ONLY rs  270  ...
