Situated at the 3rd floor of manisquare mall this small outlet provided us with snacks like aloopops or potatoes pops. Instantly fried, crispy snacks, very tasty. The prices are lesser too.

Located at the Mani Square Mall besides the Kulfiano outlet, the Hot N Fresh serves hot popcorn of different flavours, candy floss and many more..They have 3 sizes of popcorn (Small, Medium and Large) having minor variations in prices...We had ordered  medium caramel popcorn and it was really served hot and tasted very good and had enough quantity for even 2 I must say....Service is fast...But better behaviour is expected from the ones serving the customers..Popcorn and Candy Floss lovers can definitely give it a try....

I have tried cheese popcorn and butter corn. 
It's a small outlet. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
Pretty quick service. 
Quality is average.

If you're going by Escalator, this be the first to hit on ! Thus it is located on the Top Floor of the Mani Square Mall.

It has no separate seating arrangements. The Cheese Popcorn needs a check.
But the Candy Floss is good. Oh ! I so love it. *giggles* :D
The place looks attractive. 
Service is quick and satisfactory.

Overall, Take your kiddish instincts out and try the Candy Floss ! Well, who doesn't ? Hurry ! :)

For a kiosk selling junk food it has some really rude staff that drags down their rating. The food quality is ok & kids love french fries, candyfloss, popcorn, soft drinks, etc. anyways. But the service is atrocious, I'm being too polite here, & the attitude of the staff terrible. They turn down customers if you fail to give them the exact amount of the item & snap at you if asked for a napkin or something else. Whoever is managing the kiosk needs to seriously look into this issue.

Located in 3rd floor of Mani Square Mall, Hot N Fresh is famous for its flavored popcorn & cotton candy. Cotton candy has traveled the sphere under a variety of aliases. It's candy floss in Great Britain, fairy floss in Australia, Papa's beard to the French, Zucchero filato in Italy, Hawai Mithai in western India and Burir Chul in Bengal. Cotton candy may lack the "wow" factor, but it does have its own kind of magic, the magic of riding the time machine. Cotton candy wasn't always kids' stuff. In fact, it was European dessert aristocracy at that time when sugar was so rare that it was kept under lock and key.

Cotton candy makes you feel like a kid again. We all watch spellbound as the cotton candy maker spins a confection that looks like pillows of wool but melts in your mouth like a snowflake. If you don't have a sweet tooth, be prepared to develop a sweet tooth and then give it a try. Foodies who love cotton candy can find refuge at Hot N Fresh.
