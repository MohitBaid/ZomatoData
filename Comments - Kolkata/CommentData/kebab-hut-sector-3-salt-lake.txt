It is located near tank no. 13 ... they serve kabab and biriyani ... the size of the kebab is small as the chi. Pieces in the roll but at this price its what we can expect but the taste is horrible kerosene smell will comes from it. If u want try it for once than u can by that i mean once only not 2nd time.

Food quantity as mentioned 4pcs kebab but size matters...well thats shocking! 4 pieces are very small pieces. I also ordered tandoori chicken(half portion) the chicken they delivered me was half cooked, the outer layer of the chicken was cooked but inside it was not.
This place situated near to my residence I was very excited that I will get some good Kabab but unfortunately I was shocked that making the food pocket friendly they have neglected totally regarding food quality and quantity.
I wouldn't mind if they raised price some more and has served a better quality of food.
This place is newly opened. I hope they will look after this matter & make changes for good.
Not now for sure, but hope to try from them again sometime.

A small hut with full of yummy kababs. Tasted kababs only once. Though many kababs were out of stock still we managed to have two plates of kabab. It was delicious. Will visit soon

The idea of a live kebab counter is the most exciting thing that can happen to a hungry kolkatabashi on the street , and this little kebab counter outside IA Market knows that too well ! The family that runs this little kebab counter has done a brilliant job by making kebabs available to the ordinary passerby and pedestrian , that too at delightfully low prices ! The chicken boti kebab and chicken haryali kebab here are the two most popular dishes. The chicken haryali kebab contains three pieces of skewered chicken , with capsicum and onions for company , cooked live on the grill next to the counter , and served with a green chutney. The kebabs here are great for a quick bite in the evening, and the average serving time is 5-7 minutes . Do order in and encourage the newest kebab kid in the block!
