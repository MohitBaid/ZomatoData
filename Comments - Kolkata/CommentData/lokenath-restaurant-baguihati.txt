A good choice for eating on a budget. I had ordered in from here and was pleased with the food and the money it charged. 

A plate of chicken chowmein , a fish fry and 2 chicken rolls for Rs. 150 ... A steal right ?? 

I had ordered in so didn't visit the place, the food is tasty and quantity is nice. 

I liked the dishes, the roll had generous chicken filling and it was a good meal

This restaurant is situated just beside teghoria SBI. The restaurant is small and does not offer a great variety in terms of food. There are only four tables and seating arrangement is not that great either. This place is much known for the rumali roti they serve, and to be honest it's quite good. Biryani, chicken kosha, tarkas , or rolls for that matter are not that mention worthy. They are not bad, bit not that good either. I personally found this restaurant to be a little dirty. So I prefer taking the food back home with me rather than dine in. The management should look into these things. :)

Each age group in one's life perceives new enthusiasm. The same happened to me about less than couple of years back, when I was searching for e-corner of a SBI. On the search for the delight I had traveled from Kaikhali to Raghunathpur and while leaving came across this restaurant.

Located just beside the SBI e-Corner at Raghunathpur, this is an eating joint which seems to have graduated from a roadside stall to a restaurant, while the skills still being that of a roadside one. I have had visited this joint only once and honestly do not feel like giving a second opinion. The reason why I feel so dejected are stated below.

On the visit to this place, I made my way inside for being seated which they (cook and/or the staff) resisted giving the excuse that food isn't available that particular day. On asking what might be available they said nothing at all, even though I saw roll being prepared. When I pointed at the roll being prepared, one of them said that having a roll doesn't qualify you to be seated inside the restaurant to which I nodded and left, without having anything.

A visit to be avoided at any cost!

This is a small place situated just behind the Teghoria vegetable market. It is more like a street food joint. There are only four tables and they serve rolls, biryanis, mughlai and romali roti. People like this place mainly because of the rumali roti. There's not much to offer from this restaurant.

Okay so let me tell you this would be a "Okay" place to eat if you can shut down your conscience about the "Hygienic" part.The food is low priced and tastes also "thik thak".But the thing which forced me to give it a bad rating is their hygiene.Otherwise worth of giving a try for occasional hungry moments.

Another local food joint
Biriyani, chilli chicken, egg tarka r fine but their roomali roti is excellent
Quality ok
Ambience needs improvement
Cleanliness needs much attention

Nothing much to say about this restaurant.  Average quality food, average looks with cheap menu. No special dishes or something like that.  So if you're in nearby this restaurant with less money in your pockets and a very hungry tummy then you people can give a try here.
