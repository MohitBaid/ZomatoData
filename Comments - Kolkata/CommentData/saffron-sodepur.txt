Yesterday I went to this newly opened restaurant at sodepur..I loved their ambience..All the staffs are courteous and helpful..let me tell you first I have bcme fan of their kebabs, though I only tried murgh malai kebab,it's so soft,delicious yummy in taste..must try...next I tried chicken fried rice and Hunan chicken. The rice was very nicely cooked but not so good in taste..again Hunan chicken was very good in taste..I bought parcel of chicken bharta,mutton roganjosh and laccha paratha..my mother gave those 5 ratings as according to her mutton was soft,chicken bharta was delicious in taste.. wanna try this outlet again and again...‚ù§Ô∏è

Sodepur lacks luxurious restaurants so this can be considered as one easily. Saffron is just 15mins away from my place. The food over here is just too yummy and quantity n quality is also amaizing. I ordered nurani kofta with masala kulcha and  butter nun. Everything was perfect the breads were soft and tge kofta waa also well cooked. Though visited only once m sure that the other items will also be delicious.

Lovely food we had today in this newly opened restaurant. We ordered Ajwaini Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Murgh, Egg Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken Gravy and Fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce for 4 persons and the quality and quantity is appreciable. The paneer was soft and the masala was mixed properly giving it a good taste. The chicken was tender, accompanied with Pudina and Mustard Chutney it tasted very nice. The Egg Rice was cooked with very less oil and generous in portion size with good taste. Coming to Hunan Chicken the gravy had a tangy taste with soft portions of chicken. The Fish was in lemon coriander was very nice as well.

This is my my 1st visit to this place. This restaurant is  in the hotel Grace located near girja more B. T. Road. Now my experience is nice with this place. As I entered The Grace I was heartily welcomed amazed with the ambiance and the decor. Then I took the stairs to reach the restaurant and the ambiance really pleased me a lot. I choose a two seater table as per my own will. Hospitality was great really appreciable. Not overcrowded. They pay attention to customers. I ordered for 
Fresh lime water (they provide me without soda according to my requirement) - 5 
Chicken Rashmi butter masala(8pc) - 4 a bit salty 
Butter nun - 5 
Probably price is hiked for Diwali. 
Now I want to share something first I preferred for biriyani but as I enquired they provide fried biriyani and not hydrabady nor Kolkata biriyani. So I didn't take the risk and ordered other items. 
Last but not the least management is appreciable.

Saffron located beside the sodepur girja is a newly opened Resturant cum banquet.. 
I must tell you that it is an exceptionally good restaurant and the best in the Bt road till date i guess, ..
When we entered the ambience was really good .the Resturant is at yhe second floor ..the capacity is exceptionally good and well decorated...

Coming to the food ... Its is really awesome.. thr provide with a variety of dishes the first time we had a chicken sizzler ,it was really mind blowing and too hot to handle üòÑüòÑ it is more than enough for a single person ,the presentation was also good we were amazed to have a continental item in Bt road.. 
we also had other few indian starters and main course some other day..the taste is amazing and delicious , the kulfi was the finisher and was good as our desert...
also to mention about the service provided is really nice and humble .. we get be advised as per your taste of choice and believe me every time we had an amazing result..

Went there with my friend to have dinner at ostomi evening. Located beside BT road. This newly opened place is quite big with decent interior and nice ambiance. Staff were helpful but a bit confused.
We ordered fresh lime soda, hot and spicy soup, crispy chilli babycorn, veg fried rice and chilli fish. Soup was okay in taste. They forgot to serve babycorn and came with main course. Then they served the baby corn which was good. Main couse was very good in taste, specially, the fish. Chilli fish was very good in taste and the fish was very fresh (bombay vetki). Overall nice experience.
