3.5 because the only thing that they seem to serve best is the roll. Chicken Roll or mutton roll, you name it. They are good at it.¬†
It is mainly a takeaway counter. The after taste of having the rolls is more sticky probably due to generous amount of fat they fry the base in?¬†

I prefer my rolls a bit on the tangy side. And they are very miserly when it comes to adding extra lemon juice!

Medium-cost 'cholable' Biryani and chaap destination. It's only take-away and there is no place even to stand and eat given its location at Nager Bazar Mode. Their rolls are the best in that locality given the Kachha paratha base.

This place is great for a good tasty meal at a cheap price. Their mutton kasha and chicken kasha recommended. Their laccha parntha is also very good.

Would have given them a ZERO rating had there been a provision for it by Zomato.Long story cut short,had biryani from this outlet yesterday night and my experience tells me never ever to have biryani from the same place ever in my life.While having it,from the smell of it one could have easily guessed that it was getting bad.No flavour,a horrible piece for mutton and rice that just refused to get chewed.Horrible experience.

Anyday. Everyday.

Anytime. Everytime.

Even if you have a very little money in your pocket, go there and grab a roll.

Yessssssss, Haji's Roll üòçüòç

It is opposite to Nager Bazaar Bus stand beside Renuka restaurant.

Their other items are also good. But chicken roll is the heart ‚ù§

Nothing so much special, Because mutton biriyani is not that much tasty . They are using gravy in biriyani..So if you take chicken kosha with biriyani as a side dish , you will not see any difference. colour of biriyani is Red. overall biriyani is average .chicken chap is good & chicken Roll is also Nice..

I am a big fan of their egg chicken roll though it is oily but tastes good. And about their biriyanis both the chicken and mutton biryani are good in taste ,the quantity is enough for two people ,the chicken chaap is okayish .They only have takeaway no seating arrangement and their service is very prompt Recently they have started their kabab counter but havent tasted yet. Good to go for takeaway when in a hurry..

They never disappoint you. I like rolls here. At this price range you can't ask for anything more fancy. Taste is quite good, oily yes but good. It is sometimes a hassle to get food packed.

Each year during the months of Ramzan, an iftaar party is being held in our complex and in one of those parties, I happened to taste the food of New Haji Saheb. There was a bulk order for paratha (also knows as, jali paratha) and haleem, along with various eatables from other shops too.

Just after the iftaar namaz got over, we got to taste the haleem paratha.

The order was self delivered and we got to taste the food almost after an hour of preparation. Even after that amount of time passage, the paratha was simply delicious which hints that it was baked in pure oil of good quality. However, the haleem didn't taste that good and it was just about right.

I am unable to comment on other constrains owing to the the fact that I haven't visited the eatery.

Known for it's muglai dishes. The food is not so good and over spiced. The only good thing about this place is the Paratha (bread) they use for rolls. Hence, I believe that chicken and mutton rolls are a must at this place. But make sure if ask them explicitly not to add sauce and make it less spicey. I would recommend this place only for this two types of rolls.

We generally used to have our rolls from here. The last time i had one it was dripping with oil and most probably used oil as it gave me a very uneasy feeling.Its been almost a week and since been shying away from this place.Their biryani is okay , but nothing that stands out. So if oily rolls are your choice come here.

Like all the haji sahebs they serve oily food. The rolls are neck deep rolling in oil. I  have had their biryani. It was an okay biryani given the price. If you are looking for subtleties of taste and spice, well you won't be getting any. The chaap is just bad. Never try it.

If you are at the Nagerbazar more,this tiny shop's aroma will definitely plead you to visit at least once. I've been their customer for the past 6-7 years. Their rolls are one of the best I've ever had.It's thick and made of lachcha parathas with very good fillings. I prefer their chicken biryani more than the mutton one.Their chicken chaps are excellent.Over all these years they have never compromised regarding their quality. One of the best fast food centres in this locality.

This take away counter packs quite a punch in their food department. The Rolls are very balanced, moist and very flavoursome. I love their Biryanis, but I would recommend the chicken one over the mutton. The Chanp they serve is also very good. I've seen a bit of fluctuation in their price chart over the past 12-15 months. and yes, the firni, you should give it a go. I'm not gonna say its the best around but it is something you should try if you visit the place.location: 6.5/10food: 7.5/10value of money: 6.5/10 ( as some items are a little costlier than usual)give it a go :D

This take away food counter gets my daily visit. Altough no dining place available here still it can attract you by their Juicy Spicy Delicious looking Chicken & Mutton Chap kept in front of the restaurant. They only make Rolls, Kasha, Chap & Biriyanis. Sometimes smell of those can attract you too. 
Coming to the food : I had tried almost everything over here. I must say their Rolls & Chap looks very delicious. The rolls over here are made with very thick crispy well cooked luccha parathas. Chicken or Mutton kabab inside it are well cooked & tasted juicy. Chicken or Mutton Kasa, Chap & Tikiya is made with same gravy but tasted good & spicy. Somehow Biriyani over here doesn't get any special attention.
Conclusion : Their is something special in their rolls & it makes them the best roll center in Nagerbazar. The prices are a tiny bit higher than other same kind of restaurants. But it definitely deserves a try.

Roadside shop near Nagerbazar with no dining facility and near a mosque and all the crappy surroundings if ignored, this place is really worth it. Just go for takeaways and you won't be disappointed. Biryani, Chap, Rolls. All of it. Really good. Plus the Laccha Paratha. It's really well made, a tad costly, yes but try it.

Placed at Nagerbazar more this place is a great choice for Rolls.
If you are here for Rolls n biryani clearly you made a great choice, but if you are here for other chicken or mutton items you made a bad choice.
My rating is based on my experience with Rolls n biryanis only.. Just another roll shop nothing fancy to get in details..

If u are in a hurry and misfortunately standing at Nagerbazar this is the best place to try some quick fast food . I had tasted each and every rolls . Infact their biriyani are also good in taste looking and quantity. Its a filler. There is no dine in only take away is applicable. But the food tastes good . Worth penny spent. It is just at the crossing of nagerbazar .

my friend lives at jessore road so while going there he took biriyani for all friends from here...as we all love biriyani..i juz saw its a small place with very little sitting arrangement...
 we took chicken biriyani and mutton biriyani..the mutton biriyani was not that good ..mutton pieces were hard and not properly cooked...while the chicken biriyani was very tasty..i really liked it..i would recommend their chicken biriyani..i have heard their rolls are good will definitely try it..
they serve fast..would love if they improve their mutton biriyani..:)

Situated right at Nagerbazar more, Haji Saheb is a popular fast food joint for the teens. Popular mostly for its rolls, the chicken roll and the tikia roll are a must try. The biriyani served in pretty good. The major disadvantage is the unavailability of seating. With their reasonable prices, it a good option for those who love to have their rolls.
