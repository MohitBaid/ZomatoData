Craving for some authentic south indian dishes? Coromandel Express is the answer. I am simply amazed by the food served by this restaurant. They have an amazing spread of dosas, uttapams and snacks. I have tried their masala and rava masala dosa, dahi wada, fried idli, and mixed uttapam. Must say that all the food tasted excellent except the fried idli as i felt it was too oily (but my friends loved it for evening snacks!). I am simply in love with the dahi wadas served by Coromandel Express and it's a must try. Several times i had ordered through zomato and their packaging is also good along with the food quality and quantity.

Had a Cheese Plain Dosa here. It was decent enough with apt quantity of cheese. They also provide a spicy chutney which was very different for me, a pleasant surprise.
Given the price and quality, I found it to be nice.

Firstly , the price doesn't match the Quality , no presence of Onion in the masala dosa even after repeated request, the white chutney wasn't thick and it was as if i am having a tasteless soup, sambhar was ok .sada vada is too small in size and that too it wasnt puffy...Overpriced and  lot of improvements required ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    o

The restaurant is located in a very prime location that is the "sector 5,salt lake" near RDB cinemas in the Bytes Food Court .
Many other restaurants are located in the same food court but we chose this because of many factors :

Ordered Idli Upma and waited for 20 mins. When enquired, somebody started cooking it !! Again 10 mins wait got the food. It was extremely salty, clearly made in a rush and extra fried. The portion also doesn't justify the price. Overall two thumbs down 👎🏻👎🏻

A small counter a part of the food court. They serve South Indian food. The service is okay. The quality needs to be raised as per the prices. The white chutney was all watery...so was the sambar.

#Location: Bytes food court, ground floor of infinity benchmarck building; opposite BIPL Building.

#service: Typical of food court - it was fast and uncomplicated.

#Ambiance: With a grey and green hoarding this joint exists on the left section of the entrance. Food court is generally clean and organized.

#Food: Had the rawa masala dosa while hanging around with a vegetarian friend during lunch. It tasted nice, but the masala was okish.

Well, I presume that they have changed their name from “Chennai Xpress” to “Coromandel Xpress” – because the former used to operate in the small counter of the same "Bytes Food Court" of Sector V – till a few months back! Had never visited this Chennai Xpress earlier, but nevertheless, visited this Coromandel Xpress today. 

I went for their Combo 4 meal – which consisted of 1 Rava masala dosa, 1 pc Vada and 1 pc Idly (and chutney + sambhar – obviously). Preparation time was not too much and prices are not too high, service being nice. 

Vada was very crispy – but a tad toooooo oily and Idly – pretty mediocre – although soft. Rava masala dosa – was fine – good but not great – masala content was decent. However, the dal pieces forming part of the masala were a major turn off. Chutney was cold (so it tasted very nice) and sambhar was hot (low on taste and high on vegetable content).

Overall, a decent experience, but definitely short of my expectations. Nevertheless, wish them best of luck for their future endeavours.
