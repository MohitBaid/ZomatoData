I'm not very fond of sweets neither do I hate tasting some; rather, I prefer some other desserts over sweets.
Once while going towards college street, two of my friends wanted to taste some sweet. I just nodded in response taking into fact the matter that majority wins.
We ordered different kind of sweets and savouries (the names which I can't recall right now) and they were served soon.
I felt the taste of those to be fine and nothing distinguishably different. 
The attitude of the staff were monotonous and it seemed they felt no emotions, which is kinda okay if not very appreciable.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) I doubt

Qs) Why have I rated them 3.5 stars?
Ans) They have placed themselves in a prominent location gaining few stars but there is no X factor to contribute for more stars.

So this has been my favorite-most places for traditional Bengali sweetmeats since my childhood now! Mishtis mean they gave to originate from Ghosh & Co.! I love their Mishti Doi, chandrapuli during Durga puja, danadar and rosogollas.

One of my friend has got some sweets from here very recently. The quality of the sweets are really commendable which I preferred even not being a sweet lovers.

Rabri and Rosomalai are quite popular here which is recommended strongly. Try out. Located near College Street area.

Rosomalai and Rosogollas as well as the Rabris are a hit of this sweet shop no doubt.
My relatives often visit here and pick up kilos of mistis and then come home.
