Best place to fill your belly with authentic Lebanese without worrying about the pocket pinch. Mama's Lebanese serves you fresh tasty delicacies with a price to afford on daily basis. Its located near Harish park just opposite Asutosh Centenary. Although small in size and best for take away, the food will compensate for it. One must try the Arbi Chicken biryani with the Naseeb and Pita bread with Hummus & Naseeb. The food is light and totally non spicy and least oily.

CHICKEN SHAWARMA and PITA BREAD is what we ordered from this outlet. 
Can't speak about the ambience as we ordered in food,but the food was okayish the SHAWARMA was DRY which I didn't like much, otherwise the quantity was good. The PITA BREAD was fresh.

Within 200meters within the given alleyway(following the map) from ashutosh mukherjee Rd,you'll find this lebanese joint,servicewise they offer quite well to their outdoor seating arrangement they have,such as providing you with stolls to keeps your food while having it.So coming to food I would say its quite delicious,its healthy too.If you are looking for even a little bit of eating ambience,sorry this place is not for you better to opt for a takeaway option if you want

This place near Harish Mukherjee road, in my locality, serves one of the finest Shawaramas in the city. Shawarma Nation was my favorite for the Shawarma but now I won't need to go so far just for a it. Only drawback is that you have to sit on the pavement.

When it comes to Lebanese food, I often end up comparing with the standard "Casa Lolo" a famous Pune based Lebanese joint. Mama Lebanese does fulfill the criteria (Unless you want to compare the same with the middle east)

The quality of the food is great. The salad is filling and the grill chicken is good. The rolls are really nice to taste. 

Though, I highly recommend to get the food parceled since the seating arrangement isn't really great. But none the less, for the food, taste and most importantly the quality, its a thumbs up!

Located in the lane adjoining Purna Das Cinema, exactly opposite Ashutosh Centenary Building.
Boy the taste of the shawarma remains the same as what i first had at Go Lebanese. Yes, that is because the chef at Go Lebanese, Mr. Rosario has shifted places and has opened up here.
The main item, Chicken Shawarma has the perfect tinge of sweetness that suits the palate. The tartare sauce is perfectly added which makes it juicy. 
Generally at other places you find the middle portion of the roll to be dry, but not here. The kebabs are also well prepared. Shish Touk and Kay Kebab to emphasize on. The salad is also worth a try.
The chicken is freshly prepared everyday. And the service of Mr. Rosario is absolutely inexplicable. 

As for the decor, it does not matter as it is mainly a takeaway joint. 
They also do home delivery if the order is in the vicinity.

First of all before I review the restaurant let me just say the number given in zomato is no longer valid and the new number which the manager of the outlet provided was 9038332789.
Now to the review.
The restaurant is located just inside the lane in Purna crossing. 
Its a tiny take out with very few shabby chairs outside the outlet. But since it is a take away I will not consider that. 
The location just opposite Ashutosh College Centenary and near purna cinema is prime so 5/5 for location. 
The staff are friendly so it is easy to communicate. So 4.5/5.
The food is healthy and very tasty so 5/5 for that.
I had the shawarma sandwich and the shawarma salad both of which were delcious.
Last of all the prices are very reasonable and not at all heavy. So 4/5.

Perhaps one of the best places in Kolkata for having Lebanese. I tried the Shawarma salad and it was just awesome. The quantity was very good indeed and they even gave some special breads to have the salad with. You can even ask for more bread. And the price is very much reasonable. If you love Lebanese food, you must check out this place.

Lebanese food is probably the best option when you want to eat out but the outside temperature is nearing the 40s as is now normal in Kolkata. Most dishes from this relatively healthier cuisine will not only fill you up but also ensure your body doesn't heat up too much. 
On a very hot afternoon we hunted down this place for lunch, taking the road immediately next to Purna Cinema Hall and the first lane going to the left brought us in front of the Asutosh College Centenary Building and Ma.ma. Lebanese was right on the opposite footpath. 
We ordered for a Chicken Shawarma Wrap and a Chicken Shawarma Salad. The wrap wasn't too big but what I liked the most about it apart from its taste was that the cheese sauce was more or less evenly spread across the entire length of the pita bread, which prevented later bites from becoming too dry. The older Lebanese outlets generally douse only the top of their rolls in the sauce, and it's refreshing to find that's not the practice here. There was an ample amount of sauce along with the chicken and vegetable filling, which tasted pretty good. The salad came in a generous quantity as well and had been accompanied by 8 small triangular pieces of Pita bread. Though the bread felt a bit under-cooked at parts, it tasted quite fine with the salad which consisted of a heap of julienned vegetables and grilled chicken strips mixed in a yoghurt based white sauce. Both the dishes came with chopped onions and pudina chutney. However, the onions were not pickled as is the norm in other Lebanese joints, and was a minor let-down for me. 
This place did fine in pleasing both our tummies and wallets, and here's hoping that they continue to consistently serve up their fares in the days to come.

Small place, somewhat difficult to locate but once you have the food, u easily forget the troubles faced while getting there...I ordered for a chicken shawarma... It was served within minutes of ordering... The uncle there is nice and helpful... The shawarma served was one of the biggest shawarma I have ever had... The pita bread was very soft... The sauces were bang on... Chicken pieces were succulent and the vegetables along with it complemented the taste perfectly... One thing to note is the sweetness of the sauce... This was somewhat first for me anywhere... They said that they had modified it to suit the local taste... But it was good...I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to have good Lebanese food...

One of the best shawarma outlets in the city, if not the best.
Not a very big shop, and purely a take-away outlet, it boasts of amazing shawarma, with one of the best tasting hummus, and substantial quantity of chicken in the shawarma at a very reasonable price.
The shawarma roll and the smaller shawarma sandwich are good and filling, but the best of the lot is the shawarma salad.

Also, good for the weak hearted, as they serve only olive oil, and usage of oil is minimal.

Easily the best shawarma joint in Calcutta, and it isn't a loadsome on the pocket.

Coming to the food, the quality and quantity are very good. Loved the chicken shawarma wraps. But the chicken shawarma salad was even better. Pricing is reasonable and actually cheaper than other Lebanese joints.

Finally! After lots of Zomato-ing, we found a Lebanese joint near our college and today we got a chance to hop to this place. Thanks to google maps, finding out the location of a place is no more difficult :) It's just opposite Ashutosh College's Centenary building.
It was the first time we were trying out lebanese. We ordered chicken Shawarma roll and the lebanese chicken biriyani. The service was pretty fast. And the shawarma.... heavenly. The pita bread was soft and a large amount of their special sauce and chicken made the dish perrrfect :D one roll can make u quite full. Then came the chicken biriyani. After having biriyani at almost all the well-famous(for biriyani) restaurants in kolkata(and disliking them) I loved their biriyani.. It was non greasy and had an awesome aroma. A little helping of raita and onion made it a complete meal. The chicken piece with it was also quite big (as compared to that given with the biriyani from other joints). The prices are also a bit less than other lebanese joints.Only disadvantage is that it is actually a take away counter. Luckily it was not at all crowdy so we got to sit on the plastic stools in front of the shop. And they do not give tissue papers. But, I will definitely try out the other dishes asap :D

Ma.Ma Lebanese the newest and i believe the only lebenese joint in the bhawanipore area,this place is quiet nearby from my place,while taking an evening stroll last sunday i suddenly came across this place, being a lebanese food lover thought of giving it a try right away,its technically a small joint with around 4-5 chairs outside,according to me its better to get the food parceled if you stay nearby,and thats exactly what i did,i ordered a shawarma wrap and asked them to parcel it,there service is really quick it hardly took around 5-7mins for them to deliver the parcel,which is definetely a good thing :) ,and as almost everyone has said by now that the things are a little cheaper than other lebanese joints.(btw Zomato needs to update the menu,the prices have increased a bit,even though its still cheap :P the shawarma wrap now costs Rs.90 ) the shawarma wrap was yummy,,,it was quiet thick with a lot of mayonese and plenty of chicken :) the pita bread was soft well baked and the filling as i already said was good enough to make you drool even after you have finished the whole of it :D one should surely give it a try if he/she also likes lebanese food,and as far as am concerned i'll make sure i try out the other dishes during another evening stroll very soon :P

This place is gonna go a long way and will make a sweet spot in Kolkata's food map if they keep up their good work and service. A relatively newer Lebanese food joint and the sole one in a neighborhood otherwise known for its old Calcutta charm eateries,this place is not really big. They have a sitting arrangement on the pavement in front of the shop(There were precisely two plastic tables and some chairs placed outside).One grill was also placed outside when I visited them one evening but the kitchen looked clean and tidy which was a relief. I had a chicken shawarma wrap which was served fresh and quick. The pita bread was soft and fresh with good proportions of mayo and quite a good amount of chicken stuffed in. The tangy taste of the sauce served was the perfect topping to this and I really enjoyed my food. Besides this I think the prices of food are also relatively a little less here compared to other lebanese joints though the quantity and quality of food was satisfactory.
Hope they keep up the good work..'m surely going back for gorging onto more food !!!

16Jan2015 - Recently tried their chicken salad and chicken shawarma sandwich. Both are really filling and priced reasonably. 
---
Mama Lebanese is perhaps the latest addition to the numerous Lebanese joints mushrooming through out Kolkata. Located at a 5  mins walking distance from my place, it was in my wishlist for quite some time. 

This small joint is located in a lane beside the Purna cinema  which leads to Harish Mukherjee Road. You might need to ask around a bit if you are not well acquainted with the area. 

A couple of friends had come home on a Saturday evening and suddenly I decided that this is the best opportunity to order food from Mama Lebanese. We ordered 2 chicken shawarma rolls and 1 chicken Iranian kebab. 

We were expecting a fast delivery and it was completed within 20mins. 
The chicken shawarma roll was neatly wrapped in wrapping foil. The pita was soft and the stuffing was very very generous. By the time we finished the rolls, we were really full. That being said, the flavour of the chicken filling is a bit Indian. Though both of us liked the roll, the flavour was a bit different than what we get elsewhere. 

The chicken kebabs were accompanied by pita breads and white dip. The kebabs were pretty good but the pita breads were not up to the mark.

Overall I am happy with the fact that a nearby joint offers pretty good Lebanese cuisine. I would definitely recommend the Shawarma rolls as it is filling and easy on the pocket (Rs80 each). Delivery is fast as well. A must try place if you are in the mood for some Lebanese food with fast home delivery at affordable prices

When i was introduced to lebanese food i thought that nothing could be better than GO LEBANESE but then i came across MaMa lebanese . I hoped in with my friend and had the shawarma roll . It was absolutely yummm . The sauce was amazing amd the chicken was just too tasty :) i think its the best shawarma roll i have had . The biriyani is actually not too good . It lacks flavour and seasoning . The staff is very friendly . Proper seating arrangement is missing . The place becomes extremely warm because the chicken is being cooked there as well

Really nice food but you should buy something for parcel as its not suitable for sitting ans eating. Overall a very good experience. Shawrma is the best. No idea of vegetarian food.

This is another new Lebanese joint to have opened up in the city.It is located very near to my place in the lane behind Purna Cinema at Bhawanipur.I have come to know that this has been started by the previous chief chef of Royal Lebanese and most of the staff are also actually from Royal Lebanese.I have already had food from here a number of times and I was actually delaying this review just to be able to make it more complete!

Coming to the food.The CHICKEN SHAWARMA ROLL is wonderful.It is one of the best I have had.The pita bread they use is as soft and fresh as you would find anywhere.The stuffing of the shawarma contains very little of the vegetables and much more of chicken.The chunks of chicken are well marinated and well grilled.The sauce is also absolutely brilliant and in generous quantities too.The sauce has the perfect amount of sweetness to it.They also provide a tasty green chutney and onions in vinegar along with the Shawarma.

The IRANINAN CHICKEN SEESH KEBAB contains five boneless pieces of chicken served with the beautiful pita bread and sauce.The kebabs themselves are appreciable both in terms of taste and size.

The ARABI BIRYANI is a much lighter version of the rather rich and oily Biryani we are more used too.Though quite tasty it lacked a bit on flavour.On having a talk with the staff I was informed they actually do not look to impart any flavour to their Biryani.They focus on a different lighter and simpler version using olive oil and a touch of ghee.I did like the idea but there may be some who will need getting used to.But then again if you are looking to try something a little different,this is surely worth a shot.The Special Biryani contains two pieces of perfectly cooked potatoes and also two generous sized chicken or mutton pieces both of which are soft and tender.The quantity of the biryani specially the special biryani is huge to say the least.

 I have also tried their CHELO KEBAB which was frankly disappointing.The kebabs were okay but the rice was kinda tasteless.They had served it with an accompanying gravy which made the overall taste better but still it left a lot to be desired.This is again very different from the versions of the Chelo Kebab we are used to.But this innovation unlike the biryani did not appeal to me much.

Although I have passed by this place a few times,I have never had my meals at the place itself.It is a small one with only a few stools available outside.Thus home delivery or take away is advisable.The staff are all very friendly and well behaved.My place is very near but still they are very very punctual with their deliveries.They are a bit under staffed at present from what I have heard but overall they do a commendable job.They are also open to suggestions and feedback.I have already provided them with my opinions both positive and negative.

The prices are very reasonable and that is just an added bonus.They are 10-30 bucks less than what it is at most other Lebanese outlets.The Shwarma Roll at 80 bucks and the special chciken biryani at Rs 150 are an absolute steal.

Overall this is a new joint with potential and from which I will be having high hopes and expectations.There are areas which need improvement and even more so considering the added competition from the many Lebanese outlets that have opened up.On the whole this is a place that I quite liked and feel is worth recommending.

All the Best to Ma.ma Lebanese!! :)

Mama Lebanese - Another good lebanese joint to grab a bite from. 
======
Intro:

Mama lebanese has been opened by Swapan Rozario who had been previously associated as a Chef in Go and Royal Lebanese. He has opened his own lebanese food joint. I had been roaming around this place and i had been thinking to visit this place for quite long and here i did it. This is located right in the lane behind purna cinema hall and is introduced newly. ======
Food:

I have tried here:-

1) Chicken Shawarma Wrap - This wrap like other lebanese joint is not served to me cold. They make it a point that they make it little warm and add on the adequate amount of sauce. The second good part about the sauce is that it is not too sweet. It is just perfectly sweet. The cost of the wrap is also 10-20 bucks cheaper as compared to other lebanese joints.

2) Chicken Irani Kebab - It is heavenly. Boneless chicken pieces are cooked and served sizzling hot with no additional Masala's added on to it. Additional servings comprises of Onion, Green Chutney and The famous Indian version of lebanese toum. ======
Summary:

Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Value for money 4/5======
Pros:

1) Parking available.
2) Can accommodate 2-3 seats even after being a very small kiosk. 
3) Customer friendly service.
4) Quite cheaper as compared to other joints.

It does home delivery too.

Cons:-

1) Less place to accommodate people. ======
Conclusion: 

I love this lebanese fast food kiosk and whenever i am passing by, i make sure to grab a bite from here.======
Recent Update: Went Mama Lebanese on 14.02.14 - Tried the Chicken Irani Kebab and Chicken Chello Kebab with Rice. Irani Kebab was consistently same. Succulent. Chicken Chello was a bit hard. However, the rice made up for it. :)
