Everyone who grew up in 90's sagar and amber was the place to be on Sunday's there use to be long ques  outside one of the most popular restaurant of 90's.
Went there for a friendly reunion with old mates
Food was great as they have maintained the quality and their dal makhani was awesome service was good and the drinks were cheap
Only problem was parking as the place is surrounded by singing bars so we had difficult time in getting a place to park our cars 
A must visit place for everyone

This is a simple restaurant cum bar and serves good food and the ambiance is ordinary. This is an old bar of the city and the prices are reasonable with the taste and location.

Not sure how many times I have been here when I was kid. All I remember is the paneer butter masala and tutti fruiti ice-cream that use to make me so happy....  The waiters were so courteous and so friendly it's quite unmatchable now a days... I'll love to go here once again if I get a chnace

A favourite amongst the 90's daddies who's frequent this office para restaurant quite a bit! The food has the traditional taste of Esplanade/Park Street restaurants. Recommend this place to foodies who enjoy an unpretentious meal of tasty cuisines.

My all time fav restaurant. Must try Kabli Naan, Paneer Butter Masala and Chicken stew. I bet you will never get this taste anywhere other than Sagar and Amber.

Long back it was very old and authentic restaurant.. In fact my childhood the chicken reshmi butter masala they served was too good but now a days it's horrible... Service is too bad and the quality they served can't amazing...its very good location so requesting management to look into this matter immediately and regain the honour...
