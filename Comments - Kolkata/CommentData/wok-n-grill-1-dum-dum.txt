Took home delivery, ordered schezwan noodles, and chicken satay and dry Chilli chicken, everything was great and tastes superb and was more than enough quantity for each of us.

Just a streetside joint, no sitting arrangement. Mostly runs on varieties of rolls. Recently they have started to serve biryani as well. I had tried their egg roll while returning from office - less oily, crisp and goes fine as an evening snacks.

The chilly chicken is good in taste. Best place to have chinese in a pocket friendly budget. Very reasonable but you have to clean the restaurant properly. Other wise a five star for everything.

It's my first attempt to order home delivery from this place. I have ordered their special mixed Noodles. It was delicious and light on stomach.

Located at Dum dum road tried some basic Chinese dishes and a Kebab from here while hanging out at a friend's place. The Kebab was a bit stiff where as the Chilli Chicken had the Indian touch in it. But the food was too oily and not so healthy at all. All in all an average experience.
