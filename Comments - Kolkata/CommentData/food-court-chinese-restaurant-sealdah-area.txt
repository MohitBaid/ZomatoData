It's located 5 minute walking distance from sealdah station. I went 12:30 PM and at first they told me the restaurant will open after an hour.Â  However, someone from beside, asked again, and told me that I can go to 1st floor. I thought waiting time will be more than 30 minute as usual I am the first customer of the day, but after placed order for chicken chowmein with chicken manchurian & a soda drinks, they took less than 15 minutes. Food quantity was enough for two people and quality was also good.

A very decent place just a half minute walk from Bank of India crossing towards Sealdha. Even in a small place it didn't miss to keep up the food quality.
Every food we tried was good in its class. Prices are very reasonable.
The Butter Garlic rice was well made. Chilli Garlic Chicken was excellent.
Seating arrangement is good. And the service is good and quick.

There are few places in town where if you go once for lunch or dinner you promise yourself to come back again. Food Court is one of those places. Just a minute walk from Bank of India crossing toward Sealdha and you will find this place on your left hand side.
.
I went there at around 2pm. The place was almost empty. A small place well decorated and lit up, consist of two floors. Fully AC.
.
We ordered for Butter Garlic Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmine and in side dish Kung Fao Chicken and Red Chilli Chicken in half plate all. Each and every item were exceptionally good and came in good quantity. The Kung Fao Chicken was perfectly spicy and the gravy was just fantastic. And the Butter Garlic Rice tasted so perfect in its such a simple preparation.
.
The menu on Zomato is out dated they have kept now options for Half plate in all of their items. The waiter was very polite and well behaved. Just the location is odd, located in the dirty Koley market of Sealdha.
.
Again don't charge any tax making your bill go down. Highly recommended. :)

It is a good restaurant for Chinese food but unfortunately I guess maybe they have some hair festival due to which in every dish on every visit i get hairs and when asked about the chef hat or a plastic cap which the chef's should be wearing a reply like "we don't always see" comes up..anyways it was a so so  types experience both the times.. But the food quality was good.

Although called by the name 'Food Court', this is basically a restaurant serving good Chinese dishes in huge quantity and at a very good price. The dishes are delicious also. They have a variety of items listed in the menu most of which are not available. So we had ordered the regular ones. Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chicken Fried Rice and Fish Manchurian. The food was really good. We were three and we couldn't finish with an average appetite as the amounts were enormous. The ambiance is not that great, a bit dark and shady. But the food needs a thumbs up! Happy Dining! :)
