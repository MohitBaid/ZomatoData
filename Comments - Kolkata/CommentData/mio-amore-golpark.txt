I have been visiting this place since my graduation days. It was our go to place when we used to feel like having something light and snacky!!! 
The chicken Internet and chicken sandwich are my favourite and chocolate mousse is a steal at the price they charge. 
Even on birthdays we would get cakes from there. The pure chocolate cake is just like the name suggests.. Pure chocolate and pure love!! 
Overall a good place and value for money!

Mio Amore is always your place to the rescue when ur in a hurry or extremely hungry.
A pitstop for quick bites that ranges from spicy items that will activate all your tastebuds , to the delightful sweet pasties to please the sweet tooth.

Mio Amore is a name that needs absolutely no introduction and I have had food from them countless number of times since forever.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I've tried out their Chicken Burger, Chicken 65 roll, Chicken Pizza, Chicken internet, Fish chop as well as sweets like kaju barfi, cream roll, Choco Delite, Butter scotch etc. I must say that though none of the items is anything extraordinary, this place provides some really good value for money.

FINAL VERDICT- I would recommend this if you are looking for a casual value for money tummy filler, nothing more, nothing less.

Visited here many times though never reviewed in zomato. Mio more is a place where you can get evening snacks or morning breakfast within your pocket pinch. However I tried there several items pastries as well as snacks and cookies. #chocolate_fudge#chocolate_cranberry cookies are my favourite. And their pastries are delicious. I particularly don't like their pizzas and sandwiches.

Well, this MIO AMORE counter is quite big and can accommodate a lot of customers at a time. The service is good and fast. 
So from here I had tried the CHICKEN 65, in which the bread was fresh , the chicken stuff present inside it was quite flavourful but altogether it  tasted a bit salty.
Then the CHOCO CHIP pastry was quite fluffy and moist from inside and was topped with some chocolate chips and it tasted quite good.

This place is located on one of the busiest crossings of Kolkata and thereby caters to a large number of people looking for a quick bite. I believe they are one of the best in their segment and does provide people excellent options to choose from within a decent price range. They have a dessert section as well and also sell decorative cakes for special occasions. Staff behavior is courteous and the outlet is well maintained.

I have always been a big fan of Mio Amore. Their food quality never fails to impress. 

The Golpark Mio Amore is not much far from
 Anjali Jewellers. 

A decently sized shop with a variety of pastries, sweets and savoury items. 

I had ordered their Laddu and Ghee Laddu. Both were great. You could really tell the difference between the two. 

Service is pretty fast. A good place to grab quick bites.

This outlet of 'Mio Amore' is located at Golpark more, just beside 'The Sugarr & Spice'. This particular outlet is a spacious outlet which has been well-maintained. We went there today at around 1.30 p.m. We ordered  vegetable burger and vegetable pizza at first. The vegetable pizza was tasty, there was a good amount of cheese, olive, corn etc on  it. The vegetable burger was however a big let down. It was dry and tasteless. I hated it, but my friend liked it. Next, I ordered a Paneer tikka masala roll. This was the best item that I have tasted here. It was delicious and had ample amount of tikka paneer inside. Finally, I went for the eggless brownie. The warm brownie was delicious. All in all, a good store. I will visit again.

This outlet of mio amore is as good as any other in terms of the quality and freshness of their stock. I cant get enough of their eggless chocolate muffin, milk muffin, choco almond fudge chicken 65roll and chicken internet. I was a huge fan of the choco lava cake by monginis, but the item has now turned more into a pile of chocolate sauce and very less of cake itself :(
Nevertheless keep serving us good you people! Thanks for the awesome food :)

This is our very own good ol' Monginis in a new and better avatar. I have grown up seeing a store of Monginis at each and every nook and cranny of the city. So when Monginis changed to Mio Amore, the nostalgic old sentimental in me became sad and thought that all my old favorites will be gone forever. Happily, I was wrong and rather than deteriorating, the store has upped its ante and come up with various new savouries and pastries. I love their Pure Chocolate Slice, Black Forest, Almond Brownie, Chicken 65 and all the other items. Recently, we ordered a birthday cake and the look of the cake left us surprised. Really, Mio amore has been an worthy successor to Monginis.

Mio Amore is a well known brand to all the sections of this society.
Best part is that they serve you very simple yet tasty products at an affordable price.

**Experience**
My favourite from them is their old and popular savouries like Chicken internet and the Chicken roll.
Also I love their muffins and walnut slices which is simple yet tasty.¬†

The staffs at this outlet is quite proactive and cordial with their customers.¬†

I bought twelve pieces of chocolate cake for my cousin's birthday. We assembled it to make it look like a whole B'day cake :P To avoid the fuss of cutting the cake in the car, we just bought slices of it, though I dnt know the name of the cake.

The change from Monginis to Mio Amore has also changed the quality of the items (in a good way). Mio Amore has included many desserts which are rich in quality and superb in taste. They have also changed few things which made it better. The Choco Moose hunting as become Choco Vanilla Moose which is one of favourite. This outlet in Golpark is lil small but you will get all the things which you want. The behaviour of the staffs are nice and friendly. 
Nothing much to say about this place because Mio Amore is known by all.

Situated on the footpath of Mouchak, this is one of the most centrally located and easily accessible Mio Amores in the city. Its close proximity to two colleges and the easy on the pocket prices has always made it a hit with the students.

The previously small outlet is small no more. Serious extensions have given it more space to accommodate more people and also the new decor has given the look of the place a much needed lift. The food here, like every other Mio Amore outlet, is delivered fresh every morning. The staff is cordial enough to let know their buyers which item are fresh and which not. They will ask you to wait a 10 minutes for the fresh delivery to arrive but never serve you stale food. So thubs up for the service. 

Two items that are must order for me, with every visit to Mio Amore are the Chicken Butter Masala Roll and the Chicken Singara, ever since I was a child. There are a whole bunch of other items you must try.

A name in and around Kolkata to which every household or people belonging from  every age or econmic group can relate to.Serving the city of joy from over 138 outlets this brand has a lot to offer.
The confectionary section has vegeterian and non vegeterian items.The former includes vegetable patties,kachuri,vegetable pizza,vegetable manchurian,vegetable burger and cutlet.
The later has chicken 65,chicken butter masala,chicken patties,chicken olive sub,chicken pizza,chicken internet,fish spring roll and many more.
The pastry hot sellers include cream roll, choco lava,chocolate excess,choco dollop,caramel,mango,butter scotch,black forest and many more.
They have recently rebranded themselves to Mio Amore,but let me tell you its not more than a mere name shift.The prices and product quality are the same. 
Just one request to the management please bring back the item fish and cheese burger.It was there in the shop for a week or so after which it cease to exist.I would love to have that in future.
So fellas if you are in the mood of a quick brunch with a two digit budget,"Moner Jinish Monginis" will make your day.

I still call it as monginis by miskate although the name has changed long back to Mio Amore. I have been very much attached with mio amore from my very childhood because of its wonderful cakes and the snack items. There are very few of the items of this place which i have not tasted and i have visited this particular store inneumerable times. 
Chicken internet being my favorite of all time ,the new mio amore introduced many new items like chicken olive sub..chicken in barbeque sauce to chicken 65 roll i am happy and eating their food from my very childhood. I just love mio amore.
Cakes are also awesome. I just love the butterscotch cake and rum ball. If you have 50rs in your pocket and you want make your tummy full try out  chicken 65 roll and rum ball and trust me you will be heavy.
If you want to go for chocolate cakes go with any of them. Mio amore never dissapointed us and i hope it never will.

The name of the Franchisee has changed, but the taste remains the same, Mio Amore Golpark sticks to its reputation that it already had even though there is a change in the house. I have not seen renaming of any existing items or change in the prices. Personal favourites here are chicken 65, chicken olive sub and choco crunch. I had also taken the pure chocolate cake for my sister's birthday and it was ¬†really good. Overall, the place is always stocked and you get an array of snacks to choose from.Still waiting if they introduce something new. I give it 3.5/5.

And an amazing thing. Monginis turns to mio amore on poila baisakh. The surprise for the bangalis on their new year. Particularly have been visiting this one at golpark for quite a long long time, ever since I was a kid and had to visit gariahat quite often for my dance classes. Monginis keeps those people alive,  those who want to spend less on their food. And so at times monginis is the sole saviour. After transformation to mio amore,  there has been subtle renovations as well, which makes this appear a bit more attractive. And finally I am always pleased with their fish spring roll and chicken samosa which is but just amazingly tasty. Well mio amore, just expecting a revolution in the menu just as you revolutionised your name.

This outlet of Mio Amore used to be Monginis a few weeks ago, anyways this one is located near Golpark crossing and is easily accessible. The store has undergone descent renovation like most of the old and rickety Monginis outlets. Store has been themed in purple and white backgrounds, modern display shelves and better lighting has been employed.

Food stocks are nothing new, this is sad but true that no new food items have been made available after change. Anyways, whatever is available seems to be fresh and prices more or less kept same. So overall a nice place for some evening snack.
