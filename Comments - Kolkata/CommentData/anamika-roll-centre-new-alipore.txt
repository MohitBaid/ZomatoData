Finally got to try out the rolls from Anamika Roll Centre, New Alipore, Kolkataüìå. Which also happens to be one of the very famous roll joints in kolkata apart from Kusum RollsüòÄ.
So, I ordered for a Chicken Roll from this place which was for Rs.50/-üí∞and no doubt it was too goodüòç.
The outer part (parantha) was very soft and crispy which a very few roll centres are able to offer and the chicken was equally soft and tasty‚ù§Ô∏èüòã.
Overall, it has quite delicious rolls and they also have a wide variety of options to choose from. They've also got chicken aloo roll which is quite uncommon and I'm yet to try that outüôàüòå.

One of the best rolls in town.....spclly egg rolls...
Their marinated onions with lots of lemon along with a dash of coriander makes it delicious.

I used to live in New Alipore in the nineties when Anamika first set up shop as a tiny cart next to a little park on the main road of G Block. Now, after 2 decades, it is one of the most famous roll sellers in Calcutta and believe me the city has thousands of them! Now that I live in Bombay, I make it a point to drop by every time I visit Calcutta. Though every roll is great, my favourite is the Double Mutton Egg Roll.¬†

What sets Anamika apart are:
1) Thin, light, well cooked parathas
2) Moist, intriguingly spiced filling - no dry pieces of meat here¬†
3) Speed of delivery - they have a lot of people to man the stalls¬†
4) Friendliness - it is always nice to get a smile along with the rolls :-)

The fact that this little joint exists on Google maps would be a testament to it's popularity!

The most amazing rolls ever .... super tired we went to this place to feed food into the starving stomach and we made the right choice 

Chicken and mutton rolls at a Anamika are the best in Kolkata 

The taste , the apt amount of green chutney and the succulent chicken made it taste like heaven

You aren't truly a resident of New Alipore till you've tried the rolls at Anamika. Frequented by people from all walks of life, you'll always find a crowd of people huddling near the stall with a roll (or two) in hand. The place is run by a band of brothers who have been dishing out their famous rolls for as long as I can remember. In fact, any relative visiting us from out of town fondly remembers the Egg rolls and requests that we do make a stop here.¬†

The best part of the rolls here are the paranthas. They are neither too thin, not too thick in consistency and the amount of oil too is kept to a minimum. The size of the roll is on the smaller size compared to the larger rolls that we get in most other places.¬†

My standard order here is the Egg Chicken roll. The tender chicken pieces are well marinated in their sauce and are cooked to perfection. Each bite is riveting in that the juicy goodness of the chicken and the inside of the roti is completely plastered with a thick egg coating which lends substance and richness to the taste. I prefer my roll to be extra saucy and request the same while keeping the chillis at a moderate level.¬†

My "eggetarian" relatives and friends swear by the Egg Roll here and are just unable to ever stop at one. Sometimes they do opt for the various vegetarian rolls on offer and never leave the place disappointed.¬†

Lastly, it is a complete treat watching the assembly line of sorts whereby each brother is tasked with doing one and only one job which as you'd expect enhances the quality and the speed of dishing out the rolls to the horde of people surrounding the spot.

main attraction is the egg potato roll, even I like that more than chicken or mutton rolls here... the proper mix of spices, thin parathas make it awesome.
then also tried double chicken and double mutton rolls, even being on a bit costly, that always give me perfect taste of rolls, lots of meats in every bites...

The place to hit after a long tiring day of college for a delicious filling snack. I remember having 3 rolls all by myself once and not being able to move afterwards. It's a small roadside stall but heaven for us students perpetually low on pocket money. The huge variety of rolls( planning on trying them all) and speedy service is what keeps the Zomato rating at an all time high besides the obviously mouthwatering rolls full of juicy chicken and the accompaniments. Going there tomorrow again üòá

An extremely popular roll joint which boasts a high 4+ score in zomato and i actually tried to get hold of their rolls twice before,  once at around 2pm and they were yet to open and the other day when i came there at around 7pm to only realise they were off on the day.... however finally made it today.... read some reviews before and somehow I was not convinced wit the idea of mashed potato inside a roll.... i thought it wud take away the fun and taste of the actual stuffing like the egg,  chicken,  mutton and paneer.... almost was about to tell them not to put it when i ordered a double egg roll but then thought of giving it a try,  afterall thats what contributed to a part of their success.... 
the roll like every other place had a stuffing of sliced onions,  local chilli and tomato sauce,  lemon juice,  chat masala,  chopped chillis,  they sprinkled some chopped coriander additionally and all of those on top of mashed potato....the paratha was not like the lachhas that we traditionally are used to,  its a thin maida roti which was pre baked in heaps to cater for the demand... a roadside roll center and all that i saw so far made me think that its a over hyped joint.... bt after i took the first bite,  i changed my mind.... wat made it different was the thin paratha which was not crisp but then tasted great alongwith the spicy mashed potato.... the roll costs inr 45 and it was heavy thanks to the potato inside... it gives great pleasure to see such roadside stalls garnering great compliments from all over and a great rating and a table topper in behala and new alipore area.... even fascinating that the hard working faces behind the stalls are probably clueless about this but they continue to dish out such orgasmic food.... kudos and well done!!!!

But boy do they have variety...Egg roll, Potato roll,Chicken roll, Mutton roll, the doubles of everything in every combination...they have got it all. Its budget frendly and served with a squeeze of lemony goodness..what more can a person want from a roll. Ultimate roll lovers joint.

P.S.- the paratha base for the roll is thin...I love that..no chewy soggy maida bite at the end.

By far the best rolls in town! And that's saying something for a city like Kolkata, which is known for its rolls. The double egg aloo roll is to die for. And if u r lucky enough to catch him when he's relatively free, he will happily customize the rolls according to your whims, which is appreciable. Always serves with a smile, which adds to the charm. A must visit, if you like street food.

Having heard a lot about this place I decided to try it out. They're known for their rolls and my friend had suggested the vegetarian rolls are better, so we had the egg paneer roll. When I got my roll I could see that the paneer had been well marinated, it was orange because of the tandoori spices. Vegetables including raw onions, chillies , capsicum and tomatoes. Now usually I don't see this in a normal roll. But I liked the inclusion of these things as they tasted very good. The paneer was soft and full of flavour and the roti that it was rolled in was thin. That was a big plus point as authentic rolls are supposed to be made in rumali roti. And this one was very close to that. It's a good place with cheap food. Rolls here are definitely a hit.

Potato, Panner, Egg, Chicken, etc name it and they have it...few years back they had serving inside the car with a host of Chinese dishes...although they have stopped all that and now stuck to what they are best with-Rolls!

Awesome place to visit unless you want to be sitting inside an ambient air conditioner restaurant...chill out with pals...

Anamika was a small bundle of surprises for me. I was first surprised to discover that this not so famous roll centre has scored the highest rating in the New Alipore area where there is no dearth of good restaurants. So I was curious enough to visit it. But reaching there I was utterly confused and had been searching for it amidst the couple of fast food take away joints in the triangular park area adjacent to Gupta Brothers and Steak Factory. Finally behind the park I spotted an unpolished kiosk right on the footpath. The name Anamika was written on it. I had least expected this highly rated joint to be one of those footpath kiosks which I had always avoided.
I ordered for an Egg Chicken Alu Roll. As I dug into the roll I realized why this footpath kiosk has moved much ahead  of the sophisticated eateries of New Alipore (in terms of zomato rating). The paratha was extremely soft and fluffy and had very less of oil. A spicy and delicious potato mixture in good quantity was added into the roll along with soft chicken chunks. Apart from usual onion and chilly dressings freshly chopped coriander leaves were also added which gave an unique flavour to the roll. It was heavy enough to be consumed for lunch though I myself had it for evening snack. 

Inspite of our exposure to finest international cuisines most of the Bengalis find it difficult to control their craving for rolls. The bongs staying outside Bengal miss this item so badly that it is inevitably included in their wish list when they visit their hometown. Anamika has undoubtedly taken Kolkata rolls to the next level. It was the best one I have ever tasted.

I did go through a majority of reviews before trying this place and I hate to say this but a majority of people have given it 4-5 stars because this place was their childhood adda or they have been going there for a very long time.
Starting with, this place looks highly unhygienic, 5 people standing behind one small counter and each doing their own jobs in extreme heat and very small place.

We ordered for double chicken, double mutton and plain onion rolls. Rolls were served in very thin maida paranthas and the paranthas were so thin that they were cracking from the middle
Each roll comes with a standard filling of onions, masala, green chillies(optional), ketchup, chilly sauce and lots of oil.
While double chicken and double mutton rolls were just plain paranthas with a filling of meat (keema + a couple of pieces) and onions in between.
The onion rolls whereas were just paranthas stuffed with onions and masala.

All the rolls we tried even onion rolls, were cooked with lots of oil and the oil was even dripping in the wax paper in which the rolls were served.

Overall the place is a chaos, with the waiting, heat and crowd. The rolls aren't worth it. I would suggest having rolls from a better place like Park Street. Anamika is not worth the time and sweat.

I was looking for this roll center for quite some time, but nobody in Zomato had eventually written where exactly it this roll center. Exactly behind the Park is the answer, figured out myself.

Ordered for the chicken roll and yes all the people who have reviewed this place are not wrong. The taste of the roll was really awesome.

Next visits I will try out the mutton roll for sure.

But yes only one disappointment that during rush specially on Sundays their rolls are sumtyms not upto d expectations.. Need to look after that problem. Else it has got amazing rolls..

The best place to have roll in kolkata is Anamika Rolls. The people who run it are very nice and kind. Their rolls are amazing. My favorite is Double Egg Roll with lots of Onions and Greenchillies. 
It's satisfying always.

I wish we had the option to rate it above 5.0 ..I would surely do so if I could. Rolls are fabulous. The egg roll is just yum. Very cheaply priced, the food is beyond words. Just that it uses excess oil in the preparation of the roll, but that is okay ;) ..i always have egg roll and I'm never ever disappointed. The rolls are very very filling and one roll is enough for a meal! I love it .i will highly highly and highly recommend everybody this place. Simply lovable.

This is a very small joint located @new alipore , beside triangular park . Its a take away rollcentre so i ordered a chicken roll for myself. They dont even provide a laccha paratha. Its a plain thin paratha i mean really thin like a paper. With 5pcs of small chicken and some corriander leaves and onion. They charge rs 45 . Not worth the money .

One cannot miss this amazing roll center in Kolkata. It's your bad luck if you have not visited this roll centre. The best I must say. The best part was, it was available till midnight. Ambience, I would say it's more like a counter where you have to stand and eat, but it's worth it.¬†
We were all craving to eat rolls, so my sister suggested this roll centre. We went there at 10 pm and ordered 2 paneer rolls, 2 double egg chicken roll. A simple roll made our dinner so delicious. Just a normal roll, which includes a paratha which was not too oily (they are very health conscious ;P), few paneer and sliced onions and cucumber, and for double egg chicken roll which included one paratha, egg and well cooked tandoori chicken and onion and cucumber and you can even ask to add your favorite sauce.¬†
The service I must say, they are very very very fast. Reasonable prices.

After hving momo from steam and fried ( review given ) in which i was not really satisfied i went to have rolls from anamika.. And trust me... I was soo soo happy. Yay.. One of the best rolls i ever had...

Location -- new alipur triangular park.

Ambiance-- simple roll counter.. U have to stand and have the rolls..

Food -- i had paneer roll at 40/-

some points to b noted.

i) the paratha was soo soft and not so oily..

ii) the paneer was not that spicy

iii) the paneer was soo soft

iv) the tinge of lemon added to the taste.

v) the onion... Uuuf ufff i love the taste..

Superb u r..anamika.. Love u

Will be back for more...

This one is a very small roadside role center, but they have a very large collection of rolls. This is located just beside the triangular park opposite to Gupta Brothers. The special thing about the rolls is the bread. It melts in the mouth. The quality and quantity of chicken chunks in a chicken roll is very yummy. Overall a good place.

Being a vegetarian, I have only tried the simplest of the rolls they have and even that seems to have a magical taste so you can imagine the rest

Road side thella wala is the first thing you see... this was my first time there so had something else in mind. Well coming to the food, it was a pleasurable experience. Did not love it though. Due to the crowd out there the quality is ¬†bit below of what is expected. We had rolls : PANEER & EGG CHICKEN. The spices were not mixed evenly. Surely due to the fast service they have to provide. Well not sure if i would go there again. Best of luck.

After kusum rolls, the next best destination for rolls is Anamika. To me their rolls are the lightest in Kolkata. Hygienic, quick, nice service all make it worth it. By nice service I mean they have boys who run around and serve in the cars. 

Don't know why they shut their noodles counter. Half plate noodles or egg fried rice used to be more than a meal. Hoping they would start again some day.

This stall just beside the triangular park New Alipore , opposite Gupta Brothers New alipore , is well known for Rolls . 

Well , when you talk about street foods , you actually don't consider many criteria to judge , except its taste . 

Talking about the rolls I had , Egg Chicken Roll , Rs.50/- . What inside is what that matters , the   roll has a thin bread layer (wrap) , inside the chicken is good , moreover kebab , which makes it good !

Anamika was quite a recent find, and i regret not being here before. Its a small road-side stall whch makes great rolls and is extremely popular in the New Alipore area. Have been there twice.. Tried their chicken and egg chicken rolls, and loved it. Chicken roll priced at 40Rs. is definitely worth a try. Would love to try their other rolls in my following visits.

This place is, what a Bengali foodie would call, "khasha khaoar jayega" :D not a shop or an eatery, Anamika is simply a roll counter on the pavement capturing the taste buds of passers by and roping them in!!

Simply put, the rolls are great. Forget Arsalan, forget Shiraz and forget any other damn place. Tender and thin parathas that are fried just the right amount coupled with generous fillings makes this place stand apart!

The mutton roll is oh-so-great! The egg mutton roll is oh-so-greater! :P

The sad thing is the first time I had visited this place, mutton roll was priced at 35. And now the prices have skyrocketed! :(

The rolls are quite light and not at all oily. A great experience overall.

Anamika Roll Centre is the typical thelawala road side food you kind of cherish in any city. I have been eating there since I was 15. My elder brother who was superbly fond of their onion rolls and paneer rolls kept bringing me back every weekend.¬†

15 years down the line nothing about them has changed. You can‚Äôt have a bad day at Anamika. I‚Äôve tried their paneer roll, their onion roll, their potato roll and a bite of their egg chicken roll. All very good.¬†

The beauty about this place is its prompt service and the fact that after a couple of times the servers remember your order and the way you like your roll. I like my paratha crisp, with saut√©ed onions as well as raw ones. No sauces, no green chillies but topped with lots of lemon. I usually pair my onion roll with a potato roll or paneer roll. It somehow just tastes better.

A tad bit overpriced it may seem, however the taste and the quality justifies it. The paratha they serve is not the trending Lachcha paratha, but the very quintessential type. Unlike the lachcha it lends a support to the constituents inside the roll and doesn't become the main constituent itself. The paratha is crisp and light. The day i first went there, i was having some trouble with my stomach and wasn't very inclined to add to the gastronomical trauma. one of the many men manning the counter, assured me of the quality of oil and ingredients used. Kind of challenged me that I will not have a single foul burp after having it. I decided to take the plunge, and without making it any more dramatic, i really didn't feel any kind of inconvenience. Quality is a top priority when u r serving food. Appreciated. Wont say much about the taste aspect. The chicken or the panner never tastes stale or left over from last nights low sale count. They are fresh and well cooked. Only I wish they could maintain a cleaner and more organised counter. And I also wish they could give the aloo stuffing in the egg roll as complimentary and not add a separate item in the menu with a 10 bucks stepped up price.

A small roll centre at the turning point of New Alipore.My first visit to that stall with my love.He is crazy abt that place bcoz he is going there from his collage days.The place is full crowded.6People are making rolls over there.Its really shocking that from other place there service is so fast.The price is reasonable.

Now come to the food part they makes different types of rolls like pander,chicken,egg,mutton.We both ordered for a double egg roll.The parathas are nt very hard nd everything they put inside the roll is perfect. The taste of the roll is Yummy.

It's a place you'd love to visit again.Whenever we both went to New Alipore its a fixed we stopped the car there and have roll.

The chicken rolls as well as the egg rolls are excellent.They add loads of lemon juice which gives the roll a very refreshing and distinct flavour.The parathas which they use are very thin not your usual laccha paratha and thus makes the roll softer and even tastier.
     This roll shop may appear very basic but caters to loads of people because they maintain good quality while offering great taste.And dont forget to tell them to fry the onions in your roll, believe me it tastes much better.

'Anamika' silently throws an open challenge to the traditional biggies of roll makers in Kolkata .. the making, the filling does'nt look any different, but the taste is absolute bliss .. Use of coriander leaves is a speciality, and really enhances the taste of their rolls .. the parathas are perfect in terms of thickness, which really lets you enjoy the filling .. 5-6 people working in a roadside stall would amuse you, but each one of them plays a vital role in the making of Anamika's Rolls .. My personal favourite is the Double Egg Potato Roll, as I am an 'egg-etarian', but I am sure this shop has never had a customer return dissatisfied, with any of their rolls .. A request, get your chinese stuff started again .. It was the best chinese food in the vicinity .. Great job guyz !!!!

I remember the time when we would walk from our skool to just grab roll from anamika... D place till today stays the same, one of d rare places in kolkata where quality hasn't changed... Though I miss the making Chinese by them... Which is not anymore a part of them... But the Chinese would surely give any good restaurant a tight competition... D veggies have the option of paneer/aloo / only onion roll...  The health freaks also can have a no oil paratha n still enjoy the flavour of d roll....

If you're one of those people who goes about trying rolls from every famous joint in the city just to ascertain where you can possibly find the best rolls, then you MUST come to Anamika.

The shop is opposite to Gupta Brothers and is very hard to miss after 3 in the afternoon, when their business for the day is in full swing.

The parathas they use are almost paper and isn't even deep fried. If you're counting your calories, a roll from here won't make you feel too guilty. Both the chicken and the mutton are amazing and have very distinct tastes. They are subtly spiced, succulent and taste divine. They make sure that you don't have to launch a search party for the meat in your roll, unlike some places that I know of; there's enough in every bite. The only downside is that, more often than not, it'll be a little too salty.

If you're a meat lover like me, you'll go for double the amount of chicken or mutton. Also, the mashed potato stuffing is to die for. Goes very well with both the chicken and the mutton. Complements the flavours and textures really well. It's generously spiced and even fried a bit. It's not bland and doesn't seem out of place when you eat it, like you might have at other joints(read Gariahat). Even the egg roll with the potato stuffing, or just the potato roll taste great. I've never had the paneer roll but I've heard it's as brilliant as anything else from this little road side stall.

The one thing I truly love about this place is how you can add on to or customise your roll. My favourite here is the Egg Double Mutton with the Mashed Potato stuffing. For the quality and quantity of food that you get here, it's great value for money. Although, be warned. It gets pretty crowded after 6 and on weekends you'll probably have to hustle.

Anamika... Well what can I say about this institution. I've grown up eating rolls and Chinese from anamika, and even though they have stopped chinese section,it still is a fabulous roll joint.

My fav is the egg double mutton roll, crisp and thin paratha with egg on the inside. Into this they stuff the spicy boneless chunks of mutton which are well spiced and provide you with a glorious melt in the mouth experience. Nowhere have I enjoyed such soft and tender mutton. 

The quality of the ingredients is excellent and you can see them maintain the taste consistently over the years. 

The brothers tarak, somnath and debnath are wonderful people and make it a point to personally attend to scores of hungry people.

Excellent

This roadside roll joint/stall is more popular than major restaurants in the locality. It is situated nearby the triangular park of new alipore and adjacent to the "Azad hind dhaba". They offer variety of Kathi rolls. Things which make this outlet special and better than other roll stalls is the- quality, tenderness and flackiness of the paratha, not deeply fried hence no extra oil, the quality and quantity of the fillings that goes into the roll(chicken, mutton, potato, veg) everything has a perfect blend and balance of spices and has its own distinctive flavor, good quality of sauces used for dressings, the tangy masala sprinkled over etc; all these distinctive things takes their offering into a whole new level. Even though this outlet always stays cluttered with people, the service provided by the operators is very fast and efficient. They fulfill everyone's different type of criteria and choices regarding the dressing efficiently and smilingly even in during the peak hours. Everything about this outlet makes it unique and a class apart.

Its a small stall famous for its rolls.. Have been going here since childhood for an evening snack. It opens in the evening after 3 i guess. The filling of the roll is quite good. Earlier it used to attract larger crowds bcoz of ita famous chowmein .but since that has stopped there are limited roll lovers. However its quite cheap and good. Have a quick roll and u r full until dinner. Cant vouch for non veg rolls. But since i see customers for egg rolls generally i guess it must be good . though sometimes the paranthas are little oily. But the taste of the paneer or potato stuffing is yummy.
So must try:)

Anamika Roll Centre is a great place to grab a stomach filling roll !! It might not stand out unless you are looking for it cz its tucked in a corner  near Triangular Park  , New Alipore .  

Food : The menu is closely elaborate & gives u choices to choose from.  The best thing about this joint is that they dun cut back on the quantity ( be it paneer , chicken or mutton ) you won't have one last bite with no filling ;) 
I especially love their Double egg Double chicken roll :)  The chicken fillers are supa succulent & the paratha yummy !

#Prices are pocket friendly # high on taste & quality## highly recommended :)

Well this place is just  on da opposite of new alipore gupta brothers shop. As we say its a " Paati roler dokan", But dont go on the looks folks, woh kehte hain naa " Chehra kya dekhte ho..... dil me utar kar dekho na... " From the outside it looks as paati but once you gulp down one bite ull be like its awesome. The rolls made here are as delicious as it can be.

Poeple from all around the city come here to have their bites. The rolls are not too thick. Not too oily, nd fr a change hygeneic, I havnt heard anyone with bad tummy after having this. Different types of rolls are available, but if ur a non veggie u must try Egg chicken roll here its just awesome. For veggies, paneer roll is the best.
The prices here are also very reasonable.
And if u go by a car they will also serve u.

A little mention, the shop opens from 4 Pm onwards, so dnt go at lunch tymes.

Overall, a nice place to go nd have some quick bites...i bet it wont disappoint..

While driving down from majherhat to New Alipore, you might have seen a tiny roll shack, outside of which you'd find people drive up in their Audi's and BMW's to grab a bite of what must be-One of the best rolls in Kolkata. Atleast for me it is. 
I live nearby, and whenever I come down to grab a bite here, there's always a flock of people waiting eagerly for a bite. 
The rolls are juicy with crisp parathas. They put in a good handful of onions and a dash of lime along with coriander and chaat masala along with the fillings to make the perfect roll.
However the rolls are a little small, which would urge you to order for another. 
They have a lot of options and while Egg Chicken roll is my favorite, the aloo roll is pretty popular too.

Some people say this is the Aliporites answer to all the big roll places in other parts of town and that it's a poor mans choice. I disagree. They may not be the same as the places in Park Circus or Nizams but it has a charm of its own. 
What started as one little stall/cart has now expanded to several. One for Chinese and another for the rolls. 
I love the double chicken roll. Double egg double chicken is also very good. For veggies the paneer rolls are good and usually are fresh. 
If you like Chinese you can't go wrong with the chilli garlic noodles. I prefer my noodles vegetarian but the non veg noodles and fried rice are great too. 
One has to come here early as they tend to run out of food by 7 or 8 pm. Which is a good sign as it shows how much people like the food and that they don't keep food overnight to sell the next day eliminating the chances one can fall ill due to improper storage. 
If you're in New Alipore and peckish this is a must try!

Location: New Alipore, Opposite Gupta Brothers. 

This place isn't a small eatery or something like that! 
It's a roadside roll centre. 
But, as we say,'Never judge a book by it's cover', it applies exactly to this roll centre. 

Serves one of the best rolls in town. 
It opens up in the evening and has customers from all over Kolkata waiting to get their rolls. 
Being near to my residence, I have been visiting this since childhood, nine years to be precise for their rolls and Chinese dishes! The Chinese section was however put to halt a few years back due to internal issues of the owners. So, its just the rolls they serve now, henceforth introduced it just as a roll centre. 

Coming to the point, 
I have tried some of their available options in vegetarian rolls: 

- Paneer Roll 
The Paneer is soft and has the right mix of spice along. More like a Tandoori Paneer filling but tossed on the griddle.
The wrap is thin and flaky filled with Paneer pieces, onions, lemon juice, ketchup, chilli sauce and a pinch of salt all except the paneer pieces according to your taste preferences. 
Tastes awesome!

- Double Paneer Roll 
Just the same as the above, but with a double dose of Paneer! 
Recommended! 

- Onion Roll 
This is one of the lightest yet yummy rolls they have on offer. The wrap is non-greasy and thin with a filling of thinly sliced onions, ketchup, chilli sauce, zing of lemon and a pinch of salt, all made according to your taste preferences.
Simply yumm! 

- Aloo Roll
As the name suggests, the roll has a potato filling in it. The filling was great to taste, boiled potatoes mash-mixed with pepper and salt and saut√©ed a little. 

The staff out here is super quick in processing the orders which implies there is speedy service too!

Prices are pocket-friendly. 

A little hygiene maintenance is called for.
Otherwise,
Overall a good experience. :-) 
- Has never disappointed me ever.

Surprise Surprise, they have the best rolls at this place located in alipore.It is basically a thela and dont be fooled by the appearance,their stuff is good and i havent had anyone claim that they had a bad tummy  after eating here.My favourites here are the onion roll(filled with onions slightly browned and green chillies),egg paneer roll,paneer roll.I like the parathas here,not too think and done beautifully.
Their stuffing is generous and dosent keep falling off as you progress down the roll.
I simply love this place, and whenver im in this area i stopby for my favourite onion roll.

I have heard about this place before but it was only last weekend that i got a chance to taste the best rolls of Kolkata..  We ordered double egg chicken roll.. The very first bite of this heavenly roll took me to the seventh cloud.. Unlike other rolls, this was not dripping with oil.. The coriander and onions were fresh.. And the best part was the chicken which tender, juicy and perfected by the choice of their spices.. I wish i could give five star but the stall is not well lighted and maintained..

If you are a Fan of the famous Kolkata Roll.. or just a Fan of good Non Veg Food, you must, I repeat MUST visit Anamika Rolls in New Alipore.. The only down side of eating Rolls in this family run joint (all the brothers are seen chopping onions and lime, Frying the paratha, and making and serving the rolls) is that you will never really enjoy Rolls in any other part of Kolkata ever again..

My personal favorite is the Double Mutton Roll, with Chilli Sauce (No egg, and no Tomato ketchup). This Roll is literally to die for, and would definitely be on my plate when I am having my last meal.. The meat is 'Bhuna' to perfection.. soft, full of flavor, and melts in your mouth.. One thing that makes the Anamika Roll stand out is the Paratha.. they are much thinner than the Paratha's normally used in any other Roll joint.. This makes the whole experience more memorable, and less heavy..

There are a lot of Veg options.. like Alu Rolls and Paneer Rolls.. So, there is something for everyone.. As per Tarokda (the eldest brother), there are days when they sell 800 ROLLS !!! And somehow, going by the taste and the service, I tend to believe him.. Oh !! Did I mention.. super value for money..

On the whole.. great taste, great service and great prices... How Great is That !!!!

The place has not changed in the pas 20 odd years... The taste of the rolls are just brilliant and I don't know how they keep the taste the same... The world has changed but not their rolls... And one more thing... 300 bucks for 2 people is false... To pay 300 bucks in anamika you need to eat atleast 10 rolls... Love this place from childhood days...

This place has to be magical. My cousins drove me from Ballygunge to Alipore so that I could have one of the best rolls during my stay in Kolkata. And the place lived up to the expectations. The rotis are nice & crisp. The sauces used to marinate the filling is what I am told a Kolkata special. I had the chicken roll and the egg roll. 3 pieces in total and my dinner was done. They have some good combos so take a look at the menu you will surely get something to excite your taste buds. 

This is a road side stall so no you have to sit In the car or then stand around the place. I suggest you take your water and drinks since he doesn't serve them.

Anamika is a place I have discovered recently, after I started traveling to New Alipore more, and I have to say, the place makes one of the better rolls in the city. The best thing is, the paratha is absolutely perfect. Its not too thick, or too thin, but just right, and I love the egg chicken roll, which is my standard order. I also eat the plain double chicken roll with no sauce, extra chillies and lemons, and till date, they have not messed it up even once. One thing - eat these hot, as I have found that when they are cold, the paratha goes limp, which is a personal no-no for me.

Anamika Roll Centre - Supplying Rolls of top quality in New Alipore! 

It situated near triangular park and very near to Azad hind Dhaba, New Alipore. This is basically a stall established since few years on the footpath of the main road. They are around 3 brothers who altogether operate this fast food joint. Previously, it comprised of another stall beside it which served Few indo-Chinese preparations which was suddenly stopped due to disputes.

Food description: 
They have rolls prepared in thin soft maida roti comprising of the oil required in appropriate quantities cooked with various food items such as paneer, chicken, mutton, egg. I had been eating rolls here since 4 years now and what makes this place special is you can grab a bite and have a chit chat with your friends with your cars/bike Parked or while walking. 

Paneer roll: Paneer is very tender and the marination in which it is prepared goes hand in hand with the roll which attracts a lot of vegetarians. 

Chicken roll: I always prefer to eat because they supply tender, soft and juicy chicken marinated in their special sauce which is sufficient enough to satisfy our taste buds. If you are hungry I would say try double chicken double egg roll which comes at a cost of 60-65 approx and is stomach filling. 

Sometimes a plain onion roll or an egg roll is good enough. 

How I prepare my roll: I always make sure to insist him to put less oil and make sure I fry chicken/paneer before serving into my roll and have little of both tomato n chilly sauce sprinkled with lemon. 

Advice: Avoid going on Sundays as its over over crowded. 

They provide prompt service and caters to all types of people. 

I'm satisfied with their rolls. :-)

Anamika: a very small roll center comprising of one stall.  Previously, it had two stalls one for rolls and one for chowmien, manchurian and rice etc(which I still miss). It is situated near Azad hind Dhaba new Alipore. Anamika serves the people of new Alipore+plus people from distant locations with awesome rolls. people from different areas such as salt lake come to eat their rolls. What makes their roll special is the thin roti prepared with very less oil(compare to other roll hubs) and the way the chicken or paneer is marinated in simple and a very different Way. I have been visiting anamika since the time I was a kid and it has never disappointed me. People from distant areas come in their respective cars and park the cars nearby and the roll workers even take orders in the car and supply them therein.  It is a cheap fast food Center which is hygenic than the rest roll Walas. 

Suggestion: always visit during weekdays from 4-8 pm. During weekends, it is too crowdy. 

Complaint: they should reopen their chinese stall which offered chowmien, rice, chilly chicken , manchurian etc. because believe it or not, it was simply awesome and people used to love their Chinese. I miss it. Plus, the price at which they supplied chowmien and rice was very cheap.

Lovely is the right word. everything is spot on. this is not a place for the normal roll eaters who are looking to fill their stomachs without the taste. unlike other roll centers Anamika does not use Dalda oil. and they are proud about it. all that said you can call for any roll and the taste of any will be out of the world. plus innovations like a triple egg roll made on request is something to try for the people who want to give it a shot. double egg paneer and others are new too. the fun about this place is that they are not misers when it comes to using their products on the rolls. They put with the heart and it shows when you taste them. the place they keep their stuff is quite hygenic for a roll stand.

all in all the best in kolkata

Anamika Roll Centre has its increasing patrons over the years. I have been visiting them since quite a few years but must confess that there quality is intact in spite of the ever - increasing crowd. They make every roll with patience.... one should actually stand there to see their craftmanship in action. From simple Potato Roll to Paneer Roll to Egg Roll to the best seller Chicken Roll, every roll is garnished with Onions, Coriander, Lemon and sauces. One can see a smile of satisfaction on the owners face while he serves the Rolls. No doubt they are favourites with School/College goers, Office crowd and homemakers too. I agree with some of the reviewers that there are many outlets where rolls do taste more or less same, but Anamika Roll Centre has 'that something'.

Honestly, I found THE anamika roll pretty over hyped. maybe it was the nonchalance of the guy making the rolls or the noise made by the thin crowd, that when I asked him to make my paneer roll less spicy, he topped it with green chillies even more!!! The taste is good, like any other roll you get here in Calcutta... Try the small Chinese stall's pan fried momos nearby - you'll be DELIGHTED! :D

Get 5-star food at road side Anamika Roll Center 
4 out of 5

A good friend of mine stays at New Alipur and hence I have explored a number of food joints in this area. So this time we went to Anamika Roll Center. Situated at Triangular Park adjacent to Azad Hind Dhaba, this is a road side food joint that sells a variety of rolls. Previously, it owned two stalls, one for rolls and the other for Chinese, but for some reason they have shut down the Chinese one and are only running the roll center. 

I have had the pleasure of trying both their rolls and Chinese and believe me, their Chinese used to be pretty good. I have seen people drop in here driving their cars from distant places like EM Bypass, Ultadanga etc. a number of times to eat Chinese food and rolls here. 
Though it is a road side small eating hub, this food joint attracts diners from local as well as distant areas because they never compromise with quality I guess. They don't make any of their preparations too oily, and their hygienic way of preparing food (for a roadside stall!) is a big plus for this place; something rarely found in other road side eateries. 

As Chinese is not available any more I better move on to their brilliant and wholesome rolls that are also the main money spinners for the owners. Imagine - with a neighbor like Azad Hind, Anamika's is still doing very brisk business! The rolls offered here are delicious to taste. The thin paratha of the roll (fried in very less oil may I add) is really the unique thing here that you won't find elsewhere, and this is the reason why people throng to this place instead of its neighbors. Moreover, the marinating process of the chicken, mutton or paneer pieces is really unique and you won't need a microscope to find pieces in your roll. There is a generous portion of chicken, mutton and paneer pieces in the rolls. 

Being a vegetarian, my friend always gives a thumbs up to their Onion roll though I haven't tasted it yet. I love to gorge on their double egg double chicken or mutton rolls. The meat pieces are so succulent and soft that your taste buds will be more than pacified. Moreover, due to the double filling, one tends to relish the meat pieces more. I have also tried these rolls with potato stuffing and they are also good. The mashed potato prepared with spices gives a real treat to the taste buds. I just hope that they open the Chinese counter once again.

Note: Avoid weekends because the place is overcrowded and if you are there at the wrong time, you may find that there is nothing left to order. They are open generally from 4-9 PM but on weekdays, you will find the stall open till 9.30-10 PM. Car parking is not a problem here.

Awesome! 
If u want to taste Rolls of kolkata....come to this little place .my personal fav is double egg double chicken roll...once u have it u wont need anything for whole evening.but apart from it other rolls are also quite deliii..icious.The main thing is that they make parathas a bit thin so the core of the roll can be enjoyed simultaneously while chewing on the paratha outside.people come from distant areas of kolkata to have one roll here.it automatically shows the gravity and quality . Pricing is fair.
Recommended.

Awesome Rolls! Just a small stall in a corner of the city but the rolls they serve are amazing! Their egg rolls and paneer rolls is what is i have every time i visit this place. My ever trip to Kolkata has to have at-least one eat out here. Drive with my cousins late nights, just to eat rolls from this place! Their paratha's are perfect! Not too thick, not too thin, perfect! And just cause it is a small stall doesn't mean it not happening! The place is totally crowded with people from allover the town and you might have to wait for sometime before you get your turn! Happy Roll-ing! :D

People of New Alipore and thereabouts swear for the Rolls from Anamika. This very popular Roll centre also used to sell Chowmein till last year but since have discontinued their very tasty product probably to focus on their star product. 
The Rotis which they use to make rolls are light and not less oily which is a big plus why people just throng to this place. The fillings are surprisingly different in taste and are delicious in every aspect. I have been a regular at this place for sometime now. The Onion Roll is just wow. The Double Egg Roll, the Egg Chicken Roll are all good and very light( You can have two at a time!!).
The location is just perfect, its located just at the Triangular Park Crossing. The products here look hygienic. The pricing is very reasonably low. 
4 stars for Anamika.

Ppl residing in the nearby areas of New Alipore.. you guys are lucky..haha. the best place for the indian rolls. The parathas are not too oily..not too thick..a perfect brunch after a refreshing evening stroll sideways. Both veg & the non veg rools are popular amongst all. The tint of tangy lemon juice inside makes you say .. yummy!
