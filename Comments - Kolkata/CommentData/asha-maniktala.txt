Asha holds a very special for me. I had my first lunch with my then girlfriend (who later on became my wife) here at Asha on a hot summer afternoon. The space is a bit crammed but the quantity is very decent and a single plate can be almost good enough to fill up two stomachs. I found the food a bit heavy on the spice though. But overall, not a bad experience comparing the pocket friendly price.

I have been a regular at Asha because of it's proximity with the university. Over a span of three and a half years I have literally hogged on their Indian-style Chinese food. However what I have recently noticed is that the quality is deteriorating. This being one of those rare places near college to actually sit and eat is definitely not cheap; over time their food is appearing plain SAD. Food is either overcooked or undercooked, or the plate is overflowing with oil. The service, too, is slow. Overall, if I have to say I am definitely not happy with this place anymore.

Must stop eat point for rajabazar science college students, all of whom have at least eaten here once. Only ac joint in the vicinity, serves both Chinese and moghlai dishes. The roll and biriyani counter are a runaway hit, specially in the evening.
Have eaten a lot of times of here.
Momo s are good, kung pao chicken, dragon chicken also tasty.
In moghlai have tried reshmi kabab, kulcha even tandoori chicken.
The food is good,slightly over priced given the quantity and ambience.
There is literally nothing called ambience in here but it gives stomach filled.
Waiters are indifferent and could not care less

Asha was the constant go to restaurant for us when we lived in the Maniktala area. It served some great North Indian food at moderate prices. The place is small with a seating capacity of about 20 people. The Paneer Butter Masala was my most preferred dish here. Even the soups were nice.

There is also a fast food stall right outside, which wasn’t there in the opening days.

Overall a reasonable restaurant.

Asha is a lifeline for all students of Rajabazar Science College. We have seen it through several changes- in menu, in policy, possibly even in the management, but the restaurant remains the one constant in our lives. It happens to be the only sit down air conditioned restaurant in a 5 minute radius. The food is tasty, clean, hygienic and both Indian as well as Chinese dishes are cooked equally well.
Their biryani is good, with a succulent piece of meat and a potato. However ever since they removed the special biryani option (two pieces of meat and the same amount of rice) we have had to stop ordering it because the amount of rice they give in one plate is too much for one person. I might mention here that the amount of rice in a plate varies sometimes. We often opt for the tandoori roti and chicken reshmi butter masala. The roti is made well and even without butter it does not feel too dry. The reshmi butter masala is the least spicy item on their menu which is why it is a runaway favourite with us.
In Chinese, their meifoon is absolutely delicious. The gravy chowmein is also quite good. It is not spicy and extremely filling. One plate can be comfortably divided between two. The manchow soup is pretty good. The side dishes in the Chinese section are all standard.
The price of the items are reasonable, but not very cheap. The restaurant is cosy with good instrumental music playing in the background (although sometimes they forget to play the music all together). The staff are more or less efficient but a little indifferent.
In the evenings, Asha has a roll counter on the footpath outside. Their rolls are not as good as the food you get inside and is best avoided on a regular basis.
NB: A recent visit to Asha revealed that they have stopped making Biryani altogether...what a stupid decision!!!

During my hostel life in Maniktala hostel of RG Kar Medical college I used to visit this place to avoid the monotony of hostel food solely due to it's proximity. They have a fast food stall outside that made some delicious rolls. 
Dine in part is small and decoration and ambience is nothing special. Sometimes it was  overcrowded by students from Rajabazar science college. 
Food: most of the Indian items are tasty but oily and more spicy.
They take bit more time to prepare tandoor items. I have mixed experience about tandoor, sometimes they are perfect but in few occasions they are disappointing. It would be better if they maintain consistency.
The also makes sizzlers but I never tried.so can't comment.
Chinese items are comparatively better. Cantonese noodles are great.
Staffs are usually friendly and co operative. They keep on changing stuffs which I have been noticing for many years.
Conclusion, if you have to dine in at Maniktala, then there are not much alternatives and you can try this place. It is better to order Chinese rather than Indian. And for a quick bite, their rolls are good option.

Asha is a costly hotel in the region has quite a variety of cuisines. If you only want fast food then it is very good and the ratings would have been higher. However it's dinning hall is very small almost cramped and taste of only selected few cuisines is good. The home made sauces are delicious though. The service people are very friendly and helpful. However the cost is tad bit more for the taste quality and quantity of most cuisines offered.

This particular joint is near to my house  and their home delivery service is pretty quick!
 *Good Food and really good amount
*You can basically ask them to cook as per your liking towards spicy, non-spicy, medium spicy taste!
*Quality is fine
*Momos are must try here since I vouch for their fillings and sizes!
*Delivery people are extremely polite
*Good option if you don't feel like cooking at the weekends!

Overall experience has been good although I have been at there restaurant for takeaways but never actually ate there since I live nearby. Price is competitive and students friendly, am sure none of their items will burn a hole in your pocket.

Good for the peoples nearby ( who stays in the North Kolkata , around the Sealdah, Rajabazar side ).. being situated on the main road is a plus point of place..

Food are OK, I found the taste a bit spicy, as I like spicy food, so this is not a area of complain for me, they serve only Chinese...

I stay near this place and It is a perfectly good destination to order home service on a lazy day. The food is good in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

Asha is located near my best friend's house.So went there many times with her..
The ambiance is okey....
Tried many things in the menu... But they recently changed their menu and some of the items I loved the most are not in the list now... :( The chicken hot & sour soup,chicken 65,chicken kasa...
But the chicken starter items are also very tasty like dry chili chicken,garlic pepper chicken etc. 
The price is pocket friendly also.

We frequently visit this place as its near my college. The food is quite good and the price is reasonable. Honey chicken, drums of heaven and chicken hydrabadi, chicken butter masala are the best dishes there. The interior needs some make over. Its a good place to have a meal with friends.

1.ambience-no seating arrangement
2.reception-no question of that
3.food-its good specially the roll section
4.price-normal
5.best pick-any roll be it chicken paneer or veg
Final verdict if you are a resident of maniktolla locality or nearby just give it a try...

We have ordered lunch for 8 people in our office from ASHA. We have have ordered 1. Chicken Chilli Pan, 2. Mixed singapore Rice, 3. Mixed Noodles, 4. Chicken Schezwan Fried, 5. Mayo Garlic Fish, 6. Chilli Garlic . All foods are very bad tastes except 1. Chicken Chilli. We can not completed our foods at least 40% of total quantity due to very bad taste. All these foods are below quality than a road side jhoops stall.

Today I went to Rajabazar due to some official work with my office colleague, that’s how I found this place. ‘Asha’ was situated near Rajabazar Science College. It was already 2 PM that time & both of us decided to have our lunch there. We had ‘Mixed Lemon Coriander’ soup as appetizer & I was very impressed. The soup was really filled with prawns & chicken cubes. Then for starter we opted for ‘Latmei Kai Chicken’ which was also nice. For main course I ordered ‘Mixed Shanghai Fried Rice’ along with ‘Ginger Chicken’ which was really good & I loved the flavour combination of the ginger and the spice. My friend ordered the ‘Mixed Manchurian Hakka Noodles’ it was also quite good. For desert we opted for ‘Chocolate Ice Cream’ & ‘Thumbs Up’ as there was nothing much to choose. Service wasn't super-fast, especially even they're not crowded, so don't go there expecting to be in and out in half an hour or anything but overall a nice experience.

It was for an occasion that my boss took a home delivery from this place today for 22 people.. We ordered over phone and they took the order and delivered the food within an hour... The menu was mixed fried rice and chilli chicken... The fried rice was good enough with lots of chicken and prawn in it..chilli chicken was so so... One thing I should mention is the boy who delivered the food was not at all in a hurry for money..instead he waited for our lunch to complete fully and then asked for money...

I came to this restaurant several times. The food is quite testy and aromatic. Specially their Biriyani, is one of my favourite. The Indian & tandoori side dishes are also pretty nice. The price seems to me little-a-bit high in respect of the locality and ambience of this restaurant.

WE usually order in North-Indian from here on weekends, say twice a month. They have a pretty extensive menu and their strength is their meat dishes. The Chicken Kasha is outstanding, the Chicken Bharta is delicious if a bit too rich, their Mutton Biriyanis are aromatic and loaded. Another favourite we try a lot is the Matar Paneer - that is also great. A dish that for some reason always runs out whenever we order is their Dum Aloo Kashmiri - I cannot even describe how good it is. Unfortunately, one has to call in very early to get that - they always are running out of it. For the moderate price, they give huge portions, often one portion proving more than enough to seriously fill  two people. The Chinese section needs a better chef though, and although it is fairly reasonably tasty, it is nothing to write home about. All in all, a great joint for treating your guests or yourself to some rich,aromatic,delicious Northie/Punju/Mughlai food. P.S - Avoid them strictly if you are the health food/diet brigade, they don't skimp on the oil/ghee at all.
