If u want food at the very morning ..then Sitaram is here to serve you better with its famous kachori sabzi..they also serve dosa,idli etc...their full thali meal is very good with a very good quantity of food and also with quality..their Kesari jalebi and samosa are worth testing..this joint is at the Howrah bus stand and opposite a mandir..

I would say an amazing dine in place in the mid of howrah station area. Easy to locate. Quite clean and very clean compared to others in that area. Air conditioned dining place. No extra VAT or service tax. You simply pay the printed price. Service is quite fast. Now coming to food. I ordered one masala dosa and my friend ordered one fried rice + manchurian combo priced 50 and 55 rupees respectively. Portion served was really good enough at such small price. Dosa was awesome. Size was big and sambhar and chutney was nicely cooked. Rice was lovely and manchurian was nicely cooked. Quite a good food deal at such low price. Must visit. Recommended!

Sitaram's as i have been informed is one of the well known place at Howrah station area. Taken there by my brother as he wanted me to try here. They have two sections one is the sweets section which falls first and another is the snacks and food section on the second. Sitting has been in ground and upper tier section, Place is fine but staffs are a bit absent minded.
Tried their food section in the rainy afternoon for my hungry stomach. The order were as follows:

1. Chola Bhatura - Really disappointed with it. The chola was not at all good, it lacked the taste as well as watery. The bhatura was good in size but was too oily.

2. Dahi vada - This is the item which impressed me for sure. The taste was brilliant. Vada was soft and fresh and the preparation and presentation was decent too.

3. Desi Ghee Imarti - This was again a nice one. The flavor of desi ghee could easily be found on my tounge.

When i told the staff about the chola they looked to be very ignorant about it and didnt bother to ask for a change which was really a put off for me. Staff improvement is needed.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

My mom was in an adventurous mood and brought home some rather innovative sweets from this particular shop located very near to Howrah station.This place offers various kinds of sweets and snacks.The sweets that I had were unique and innovative.I have never had them before.They had the unmistakable fragrance of a lot of ghee.They were just a little too sweet for my taste.The usual sandeshes were pretty decent but nothing exceptional.My mom said the vadas were quite nice but I did not taste them myself.

This is the best Sweet shop I have come across in town, The best part is they make the sweet for the present and future generations keeping in mind the rising diabetes trend in mind and hence maintaining the sugar level to the minimal possible. Its a must visit for me when ever I step in Howrah. Very innovative sweets very different and yet awesomely tasty. My whole family loves sweets from Sitaram Sweets.

If the thought of sweets makes you sallivating... if you swear by the name of sweets, this is the place to be. Located conveniently just 2 mins from Howrah Station Complex, this shop promises to satisfy every¬† sweet tooth.Before travelling,One can easily pack to their heart's content and carry it for their near and dear ones. Modestly priced, the sweets not only look lucrative, each tastes better than the previous one. The owners can easily give other prominent sweet makers such as ganguram,bhikharam etc a run for their money.Visit the shop and rediscover the delicacy of bengal!
