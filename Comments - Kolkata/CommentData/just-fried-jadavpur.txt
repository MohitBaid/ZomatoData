Food quantity was very less, not at all happy with the service, the joint is very small and the staffs were constantly keep their eyes on us like we've been there to steal something.

First and foremost thing is I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.It is located behind Jadavpur 8B bus stand.Very difficult to find out.Then it's very very very small restaurant,almost no place to sit.Though they put some chair and dining table.But it's difficult to sit there.The food is also spicy and oily.Not palatable.Please dont waste your valuable time visiting this restaurant.

Dear Owner,
Let me inform you that your staff is cheating you.
Reasons are as follows-1)I visited your restaurant on 27th Nov17 with nearby coupon ,But your staff very rudely inform that we should take prior appointment to avail the offer but eventually he let us entered your restaurant as if he is favouring us.
2)He did not allow us to choose any option  from the nearby menu and forced us to have what he wanted to serve us..
2)I was unable to finish the food so I asked to pack the food , but initially he said it is out of the policy of nearby but then he proactively  suggested us that he can manage if I pay them 50 rs for packaging charge .I agreed as I did not want to waste the food.But then again he suddenly  hike the price of the packaging  to 80rs from 50rs.When I protested he said he will throw the food on the road instead of giving me.But finally I paid 80 rs for packaging as I did not want to waste the food.When I asked the bill against the packaging he again refused to give us the same & also said he won't be able to provide us ice cream as he did not have it, but it was there under nearby deal.
I believe you are not aware of the fact what is going on at your restaurant.I lost only 80rs but you are loosing so many valuable customers just due to your employees unethical behaviour..
In case if you want to contact me..
My email-itsme.somnath@gmail.com

It's a disgusting place with disgusting staffs. The place is not at all hygienic and you are served bad quality of food. Do not ever buy their coupons from Nearbuy as they'll simply bluff you. They won't provide you with proper options of food and will serve you only the dish they want you to have. When we went there, water was spread on the table. They didn't wipe or clean it. After we had momo they were even reluctant to give tissues! And, their sweet lime soda was the worst we have ever had!

Food was not good. We have ordered hot and sour soup. This wasn't a soup, it's a mixture of soya sauce only. Sweet and sour chicken gravy was just a mixture of pure tomato sauce. No flavour, no special taste, Blank food. Lime soda was just pathetic..

Worst experience ever in a restaurant! Worst food with worst service. Do not at all buy their coupons from Nearbuy as it's just a bluff! They'll serve you the worst quality of food which is unhygienic too.

We went on Sunday 19th Nov to 2017.in there at 1:50pm, and out time was at around 4 pm. The restaurant was empty but there priority was for Over the counter delivery.there was only 1 waiter inside like a layman . Not hv any idea how to serve people. No glass for drinking water. Only a bottle with big hole kept in the table. After asking many times finally we get a glass for the water. No tissue paper, no salt/peppers ,no sauce at the table. The waiter told us that it got finished will be available soon. But that was just an eye wash. 
The Chicken hot n sour soup only contains soya sauce taste.
Dry chilli chiken just burnet and 3 slice onion on the whole dish, no capsicum.
Rice and Noodles quantity was very poor.
The Chicken prices in the Manchurian are very tiny. 
The ice cream they served like 1/4 th of a scoops.
Lime soda served in hot water. :(

Worst experience ever. I opted an offer from little app of RS 99 which included any one starter from the following items chicken lolypop, chicken pakoda, chicken wings and 2 lime soda. After arriving we had to wait for 40 mins though the place was almost empty. And only only chicken pakoda they agreed to serve. Taste was disgusting. And the hospitality I experienced was the worst experience ever in my life. Overall worst experience of eating at a restaurant. Will never go again and refer anyone.

Good place to tame your hunger at a low price.
I ordered one schewan mixed noodles. The spicy noodles were well cooked and full of prawn, chicken, egg and vegetables. Quite a decent place to tame your hunger. One plate is fit for 2 people.

I visited there last day. Its a new restaurant. Though its not very spacious but still its ok and interior was fine enough. Now we had chicken sweet and sour soup, which was really good. The as a starter we had chicken drums of heaven, which was good but garnish was missing. Chicken rice chicken noodles was good too but main course chicken was a bit salty (i felt). Services was not so professional but they tried their best and i liked that. So as a whole since this is a new restaurant, some cons will be there but I hope with time they will rectify those things. My expectation will be more next time.

My review is based on a home delivery, so it will be difficult to shed light on the ambience of the place for those interested in a dine in. This newly opened restaurant has certainly surprised me with the quality of food they serve.... especially the snacks items. We ordered a Chicken Tikka Roll, a Mutton Keema Roll, Chicken Kabiraji and Prawn Pakoras. Each and every item is worth mentioning. The rolls were good, the Kabiraji was fabulous and the Prawn Pakoras were simply stunning. Although one might feel a bit hard done by paying hundred bucks for five pieces of pakoras, I can assure you that the pakoras are the real thing. A big sized piece of prawn in a thin crispy batter is what you get, not one of those where you keep searching for the prawn within an oversized, overdone batter.This is one place where you should try out the snacks items.....you will not be disappointed for sure. I certainly cannot wait to try out more and the other stuff available have definitely been put in my waiting list....

Ordered lemon corriender soup, chicken tikka, tandoori roti,tadka Dal,peas pulao, chicken varta,lime soda,sweets Nd vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. They gave lachha paratha due to unavailability of tandoori roti Nd it was good but not exactly like lachha paratha. I didn't like much their soup Nd chicken tikka. But the chicken varta,tadka Nd peas pulao is really really amazing Nd worth of visiting again. Chicken varta, tadka Nd peas pulao are a must try item.

This one is new in town. Location is quite awkward and not easily accessible still a restaurant that worth suggesting to others. Not so much spacious rather a clumsy one. On total it has 5 seating arrangement. Tried some north indian dishes and some of the items are top notch. Ambience was not too classy rather normal one. Overall a place to visit if food is your only priority regardless the ambience.

Very courteous staff. The owner personally approached us and asked us about the food.

The food quality was pretty good and plentiful, given the fact that we were using a coupon that essentially reduced the price to a quarter of its original price. The lime soda was decent, a bit too salty, but that differs on taste. The chicken pakoras that we ordered were nothing out of the ordinary, but were of decent quality.

What grabbed our attention was the courteous staff and the beautifully decorated, bright and comfortable interiors.

Worst I must say...I carried a voucher with me of 2 Fresh Lime Soda and 1 starter. They have provided us with 1/2 glass of Fresh Lime Soda in each glass and upon asking to the restaurant people they confirmed that "serving 1/2 glass of Fresh Lime soda is their standard quantity". I was certainly astonished but didn't argue and The chicken pakora was worthless. I am not sure why they call it as restaurant.

Good ambience , well done interiors and great food
The interiors are okay.low ceiling, normal screen TV set makes it a happening place for live sports matches.

Very efficient, friendly and polite staff and amazing attentive service to take care of your needs

THE OWNERS who are always present to ensure the restaurant is running smoothly. With their ever smiling face they will not only greet you warmly but will get you seated and sometimes gives suggestions for ordering food too.

Tried their chicken clear soup, chicken pakoras, drums of heaven, chicken noodles, chicken rice, sweet and sour chicken, fresh lime soda and ice creams. All items tasted pretty well. The future rating of this restaurant will stand around 3.2 stars. I personally didn't like the chicken pakoras as they contained besan which really spoiled my mood but their drums of heaven were just delicious.

Bike parking is okay but car parking will be a bit problematic.(you can park it on the main road i.e opposite to kpc hospital and then walk for 5mins to reach this place). They don't charge gst separately. Awesome service. It made me feel so homely. Thank you!

This new place has suddenly became my regular haunt, where it would be to grab a roll or parcel any of their Chinese stuff for dinner.They also have a bunch of starters out of which my favourite is the chicken pakora.Only drawback is that they need to put attention towards their Indian main courses, which are not  that good as compared to their Chinese counterparts.
