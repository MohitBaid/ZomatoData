I must say it's really famous. I've tasted a lot of items here starting from Samosa, Samosa chat, Dhokla chat, fried idly, Vada pao etc etc. Samosa chat and Vada pao is my favorite. Their mixtures are also good in taste.

If you are nearby and want to grab a quick bite, this place is perfect. Samosa Chaat, Vada Pao and garam jalebies will make your day. This place also has a lot of packed Gujarati Farsan, so you can try that too.

Hopeless service. Placed an order online, they accepted order after 10 mins. After 40 minutes they called and said cannot deliver. We were too busy to respond. The attitude was also very arrogant, saying take anything else or will cancel your order. I do not have time to talk as well. Hopeless and arrogant person.

My dad went to this place today.

Bill time : around 5.30 pm.

1. Today's date is 29th May, 2017. They've sold him a Roasted Bhakri with date of manufacture 1st JUNE, 2017 coming all the way from Rajkot to Kolkata (Photo attached). HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE ?!

2. They gave him a Mixed Diet Chivda with price written as Rs 65 on the packet of 200 gm and charged 85 during billing.

Cheating an old man like this and defrauding customers who pay is simply unacceptable.

My first tryst with Gujrathi snacks began with my half gujju-telegu roomie during my time in Chennai. A snacks shop called 'Mithai Mandir' used to be our saviour in those days whenever we needed a breather from the everyday monotony of South-Indian food. Back in Kolkata, I had walked past Annaras on numerous occasions thinking it to be just another Marwari snacks shop selling the ubiquitous kachori-samosas-dhoklas-etc. It was until I read about it on Zomato, that my pursuit for "Farsans" finally came to an end! üíû

The shop is located in Theatre Road, a couple of blocks from Office Linc. The location makes it impossible to have a seating area, so you will need to stand and enjoy your food on the sidewalk. And what sets them unique is the serve of three mouth-watering chutneys - a green coriander chutney, tamarind chutney and a garlic chutney.üòª

Enough talk, let's get down to the food nowüò∏

‚èπThepla - The thin methi theplas (flat breads made by mixing wheat & gram flour, fenugreek leaves, yoghurt and masalas) are best enjoyed with curd, chunda or even pickles. Theplas are not only savored as part of regular meals but are also ideal for travelling or picnics as they have a shelf life of 4-5 days.üòªüòª

‚èπKhakras - These crispy, crunchy thin flatbreads are splendid tea time snacks. One can have them any time in the day. Good quality Khakras are hard to find and Annaras doesn't disappoint!üòª

‚èπDhokla - Both the regular gram flour and the white rice flour dhoklas, soft n fluffy, doused in the trio of chutneys, tastes aaaaahmazing!!!! üòªüòª

‚èπMini Pyaz Samosa - Love these little triangle shaped pockets of deliciousness! The filling is very simple n flavorful - mashed potato cooked with onions and spices and the outer crust is a nice golden, thin and crisp to the heart's delight (these are even better than that of Saushtra Nimki house). One can easily gulp down 5-6 of them at a go.üòª

‚èπDhokla chat - The dhokla chat is something I haven't come across elsewhere. Dhoklas are crumbled up and topped with grated coconut, chopped coriander leaves, sev and a generous drizzle of the chutneys. This one is MUST try!! üòª

‚èπJalebi - They make fresh batches throughout the day. The Jalebis have a faint hint of kesar which some might like. Good but nothing over the top.

Various other items on offer are Khandvi, Vad-Pav, Fafdas, Chanachur/Chewda/Puffed Rice mixtures, Moong dal snacks, Potato/Banana chips, Murukku, Gathiyas, Samosa, Onion Kachoris, Pakoris (palak/ mirchi)....etc. The place is a popular destination for breakfast and evening snacks, so the stocks sell out pretty fast. You might miss out on the Khandvis, Rice dhoklas or even the onion samosas if you reach there past six in the evening. The staff have quick hands and attentive to preferences. The shop is also well maintained and looks clean n tidy. Prices might seem on the steeper side but the food makes up for it n is totally worth the experience!!! üíû

It's ¬†A Gujarati Farsan (snacks) shop located on Theatre Road. They sell Variety of Snacks - Aloo Bonda,Mirchi Pakoda, Vada Pav, Dhokla, Pyaaj Samosa, Pyaaj Kachori,Patra, Sandwich and many more.

We tasted the above listed items as we needed to order snacks for a small Meet up nearby.

All the items we tasted were good in Taste, the taste here is different from other snacks shop as it looked like Traditional Gujarati.¬†

They have option of converting almost all the things in chat or they are served with 3 different Chutneys- Lahsoon, Sweet and Green .
Even the Vada Pav was cut into 2 pieces topped with Chutneys and served. I liked it. The serving staff knew their jobs well and noticed the preferences of customers immediatley.

The pricing might seem higher compared to other snack shops where you have to stand and eat, but the quality somewhat deserved it.

Our take away order was packed as per requirement . Overall it was a good experience.

One of the best places for breakfast. They serve khandvi, masala dhokla , gathiya, the papaya side to go with it , samosas , chaat and thepla. They even sell packed munchies , chips , dalmoth etc. I had the gathiya and the papaya side with it and it was really good. It was cooked well and was spicy. The masala dhokla is very unique in taste , as it has a variety of flavours going on in it.  They have this amazing garlic chutney , with coconut and chilliest in it. It's a must try. It goes very well with the dhokla. Their samosas are also very good , the potato filling inside is delicious and it has an outer thin covering of maida. It is a very popular eatery and is always crowded. The price is worth the food.

Bring a true north Indian I love jalebi it's it's one place you can find authentic jalebi which is not too sweet. Dhoklas are better than average and often act as a light lunch for near by offices. Namkeens are pretty good to by Calcutta standards. Any one from center India would not like it as namkeens there are unmatchable.

This outlet is located below Next Level on Theatre Road right next to Office Linc.
I was a regular here during college days. We would love the pyaz Kachori chat and dhokla chat they make. We would rush there during break time. Specially in winters it's a real treat.

They crush the kachoris /dhoklas and heap them with the coriander, imli and garlic chutneys. They add grated coconut, coriander or bhujia depending on which option you choose.

The three chutneys they provide with each food item is superb.
My other favourites are

Khandvi: This is a speciality dish made with great technique and has extremely short shelf life. So they make it in small quantities.

Mirchi Pakoda: the big jalapeno size mirchi stuffed with a potato filling, wrapped in a gramflour mix and fried whole. (They sell most items by weight rather than per piece)

Mini Pyaz Samosa: This one is a must try . Don't go on the size. Its goodness packaged in a samosa shell

Thepla packets : a Gujrati version of chapati , thin and masaledar they are. They come with a helping of mango pickle.

White dhokla: Rice flour Dhokla. Cut into cubes. Healthy and tasty.

Snack packets like Masala chips and Masala Muri. The Masala muri is so good that many of my relatives outside ask me to get a few packs while visiting them.

The food is hygienic and fresh. The quality has been well maintained and taste is consistent over the years. They also give as much of chutney you want .

Do try the place if you haven't. It's surely gonna be worth it.

Location : At theatre road.. near Arun tea stall..

Service : Helpful and polite staff.

Food ordered & Description : 
Have been coming here for more than 10 years now. As my home and workplace both are in north kolkata, I am not frequent visitor here. But whenever I am in theatre road area, I make sure I go here. What makes the difference here is the 3 chutneys they offer. Mint Chutney, garlic Chutney and sweet imli chutney. This combination is just out of the world.
Khandvi Chaat - khandvi chaat is prepared by adding 3 chutneys and bhujia to khandvi. It tasted good. Though simple khandvi tasted better.
Pyaz Samosa - Pyaz Samosa tasted awesome. Filling is Aloo and pyaz. Though the size is small bit no compromise with taste.
Pyaz Kachori  - Pyaz Kachori is hard and crispy from outside and very tasty filling inside. Chutneys added flavour to it. 
Amazing experience. Highly recommended.

This place is something which has so much for your taste buds. A typical Gujarati snacks shop where you get the entire Gujarat in it. Located at Shakespeare Sarani beside The Next Level Cafe just opposite of my office which is certainly a plus for me.
When you look at the entire shop its just Food Food and Food, from the packed items to the live service and to the take aways.¬†
Dropped here in the Sunday afternoon for some afternoon snacks, so get contacted with an uncle who was running the shop then. Very friendly and polite and helped us taste few items which were:

1. Dhokla chat - Heard lot about papri chat and muri chat but this was my first try to the dhokla chaat and it surely changed my concept about dhokla. Mixing with various sauces and bhujia with dhaniya, dhokla turned into something very delicious i thought about.

2. Mini Singhara - Mini singhara has been found in many places but what they had is something more different. Small singhara with alu filled inside, very tasty.

3. Jalebi - This is what i saw for so many days and wanted to try desperately from them. Fresh and tasty that i can say to this particular item. Nice in color and perfectly made.

As its just beside me so surely i am going to have more and more in future ahead from here. Looking forward for all those tasty items out there.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

One stop shop for the snacks and specially typical Gujarati snacks......
Love to have Lamba (long) Gathiya, Hot Jalebi with papita & achar... Pyaz Kachori and samosa are delicious and spicy with 3 diff types of Chutneys.... Dhoklas, alu vada, khandvi and all other snack items are always hot and fresh... Kesar penda among sweet is must try.... All other snack itmes as in Kela chips, Mixture, and other Gujarati stuff are all yummy...
Yes the prices are a bit high then any other similar shops but quality wise also they are the best so ppl don't mind in paying a bit more and also stand in que for almost an hour on sunday mrng for Gathiyas......
Definitely a must try place....

Have been buying from this outlet since many years. I find that the quality is gradually deteriorating and the prices are being increased every few months making the items not in parity with its weight. Seems the store is trying to exploit customers given the fact that there is no such store in the vicinity. In few of the snack items the oil doesn't smell good too.....

They serve probably the best vegetarian snack option in Calcutta. Dhokla and Jalebis are an instant hit. Snacks are fresh and of good quality. Serve three different chutneys to go with them.

Location: Near Arun Tea Stall; A few meters from Birla High School.

Annaras has been here for years now serving the City of Joy with delicious and fresh snack-type options from early in the morning till late in the evening. It has slowly become a pit-stop for the morning walkers and students in and around the area.
Known for its delicious chutneys (especially the garlic chutney) accompanying the wide range of snacks they serve, this place has slowly picked up pace and has managed to stay at or with the growing competition. This is the only place that has started selling its chutneys in bottles for home-use; also, they sell bottled pickles. My family does love the options this place has on offer and at times, does opt for a breakfast from here. And, never do I mind stopping by for a quick snack whenever am around. Having said that, the following have been sampled till date:

- Jalebi
Was crunchy and had balanced sweetness. Tasted good.

- Dhokla
Nicely steamed and topped with chopped coriander leaves, coconut shavings & tempered chillies, they were of a melt-in-the-mouth type. Delicious they tasted.

- Onion Kachori (Pyaz ka Kachori)
Crunchy on the outside and flavorful inside. Had a delicious filling. Wasn't found to be oily either. Tasty to eat. Recommended.

- Spinach Pakoras (Palak ka Pakodi)
When eaten right at the shop, the spinach-flavored pakoris do taste nice, but, when parceled, it didn't impress much as it had lost its crispiness and reheating didn't recreate that taste.

- Khandvi
Made out of gram flour, steamed and topped with tempered mustard seeds, these were delicious to taste when paired along with coriander and garlic chutney.

The friendly and polite staff have always been¬† quick in getting the orders parceled.
Prices have always been found to be pocket-friendly.

Overall has always been a good experience.

If you want to grab a quick bite without burning a hole in your pocket, you've come to the right place. The one and only shortcoming would be the vegetarian-only menu. Other than that, I've never found a fault with this eatery. Their dhoklas are to swear by. Being a college-goer with a limited pocket money every month, I find solace at this joint when hunger calls between classes and lectures. Do give it a go :)

Probably being a Gujju, makes them the most authentic for dhoklas and thepla. The dhokla chat with both the Khaman and the paneer is really addictive . Actually their kitchen made chutney --- imli, pudina & Lasoon are actually the catalysts to the taste in the chat . The onion Pakoris and the singharas are amongst the best in Kolkata .
I recommend trying the masala muri which comes in a sealed pack and mixed with loads of mumfali, roasted chana and bhujia is a complete Food in its own. Even the onion singhara , rice dhokla, Kachori , Pakoris have their own distinct taste . Even the jalebis have the right mix of shira and kesar which wraps up a good bite on the go .

One of the most famous Gujarati snacks so in the city, this place offers undoubtedly the best besan ganthiya in Kolkata. Even though the pyaaz kachori is no longer as good as it used to be, other snacks like paneer pakoda and pyaaz samosa continue to attract regular customers.

Overrated would be the word to describe their so called snacks. I tried their jalebis and found the taste to be quite ordinary and rather average, in fact a little dry. Their other snacks like Kachori and samosa aren't that great either as it is said to be. Maybe different people have different palette and they can say it's the best place ever for cheap and fresh junk food, but sorry I beg to differ.

Today after a really bad food experience at the next level which is situated just above this store, we came down and saw fresh jake I being made so we had to stop and get some. The jalebi was great but not fried in ghee as they claim but it was good enough.

To be honest, this review is only based on the jalebis we had and since I didnot like them at all, we are skeptical about trying anything else from here. A lane away from the backgate of St.Xavier's College, I have often spotted the crowd outside the shop. One of my Marwari friend is a die hard fan of this place and on his insistence we ordered jalebis from this place one day. Service is very very slow. We kept asking for the jalebis and the men inside weren't as busy as they were showing themselves to be. At the end we were served cold and sour jalebis. I wouldn't have tried anything else but after reading my fellow zomatians' reviews, I guess I will give their chaats' a try! Fingers crossed!

Annaras not only has a clutch of agile boys to serve you, but the proprietors are always smiling and only happy to make you sample anything that's new! Must-trys: Well, everything! Must-haves: Fresh gathiya (with boiled and sauteed papita)! Onion pakoras! Methi pakoras! Garma-garam jalebis! Dhoklas - besan and rice! Jhaal chips! Puchka packets! Khari biscuits! Corn chips! Fryums! Dhokla chaat! Ohhh, word-length please stop me...

It was one of my first outings in Kolkata this year and I must admit that I was lucky enough to get here. Definitely the best pyaz kachori I ate. Even better that the one I eat back at home in Jaipur. The best part is easily the special combination of chutnies served ¬†with the kachori. If i could, i would have brought the recipe along with me.

Another thing that I ordered was the jalebies. Hot and delicious. Making such thin crisp jalebies must be an art and that is why I find it that hard to find them. Certainly I would miss the taste for a long time till I my next trip.

The only thing I missed was a small place to sit and eat. But given the location this wish seems impossible to be fulfilled. Anyways full marks to the food.

Have tried there samosas, dhoklas, jalebis and pakoras. All are good in taste. They have recently added vada pavs which is great too. If you are in theatre road and want to grab a quick bite I would definitely encourage you to try out this place.

After a long shopping spree I completely loved the concluding part at Annaras. This place will give you the essence of true Kolkata style street food. We had Samosa chaat, Onion Kachuri Chaat, Paneer Pakora and Mirchi Pokora.. And here goes my review one by one based on their ranks,
4. Paneer Pakora: It was expected that the taste will be a little bland, owing to bland taste of paneer. I would not say they are not good, for people liking less spicy stuff, this one is the perfect.¬†
3. Samosa Chaat: This is a very common item we might have had a number of times in Kolkata, they make it good here, but not the best. Yea ! the stuffing is definitely worth praising
2. Mirchi Pakora: Yum ! I have always loved these, and Annaras have made it my best ever Mirchi Pakora ever :)
1. Onion Kachuri Chaat: I completely loved this one. The smell & flavour of cooked onions in the stuffing with the garlic sauce and other tangy sauces made it so damn good. Must try !
After all these two of us were so full, we could hardly walk. ;)
We paid: Rs 92 only !¬†
We expected: A seat & eat facility after the day long tiredness.
Advise: Do try their garlic sauce, they sell them too, so you can get some for your home .. its amazingly good !

All my visits to theatre road make me buy patti samosas, khakhra, dhokla from here. They are pretty quick when it comes to service. The patti samosa mostly vanish in an hour if you are late in ordering them. The chutneys they serve with the samosas and dhoklas are amazingly good. People can also opt for the chats in their menu which again are nice. I usually pack the ghatias from here as they are a hit at my place. A nice place for breakfast as well as evening snacks.

Annaras has been a very comforting part of my sunday breakfast. Every sunday morning breakfast without fail has to be samosas from here with 3 distinct chutneys( minty green with a touch of curd, creamy garlicy, the normal imli) mix these all three and voila, it forms a very comforting liquid and you just dung your samosas in it and have :D
Also their samosa chaat,dhokla chaat, anf rice dhoklas are a hit.
I simply adore this place for being consistent as always,serving us with delighfully tasting snacks. 
What i miss is their sabzi kachori( yes annaras,very long time ago served kachori sabzi which could leasily beat others like sharma's in taste).Sadly they discontinued it long ago (had it last around 10 years ago :( ) 

The gathiyas and other packed good are equally good.

Just as im writing this review, my tongue has started tingling imagining the taste of those wonderous chutneys and amazing samosas :D

Chaats at annaras followed by a tea at jagdamba tea stall was one of the most regular and routine activity during my college days, even more regular and punctual than the classes themselves !!

Just a lane away from the back gate of St.xaviers college, its a small shop that could be located from a distance coz of that ever lasting rush outside their counter. The staff are always trying to cope with immense crowd like robots and the uncle sitting on the cash counter is always helping them out with a wide smile. There is no place to sit and one has to stand on the sidewalks to grab a bite if he wants to have it here.

Annaras provided a wide arrey of chaats and other snacks like samosas, kachoris, dhoklas, mixtures, gathiya, subzi kachoris but what i have had almost everytime i have visited here is their samosa chaat and mirch pakoras. They add a couple of garlic oriented chutneys to their chaats which is just awesome and only one other place that prepares these as good as them is the gujarati restaurant in clive row near n. s. road. They have a pickle made of green chillies which is insane and i always get some of it packed on my visit.  

Even though i am not a fan of chaats but i love to make an exception here !!! My 3.5 only for a  lack of proper eating area ....

This is one place your guaranteed to find fresh nimki , farzan and the like .... their turnover rate is so high that the supply is always lesser than the demand. The chats are legendary and delicious and I love them. The jelebis are crispy and hot and irresistible. I always end up loading up on the mixture , aloo ka lachha etc. to carry home. 
Bad for your waistline but delicious to your taste-buds Annaras gets a thumbs up from me for all the wrong things to eat prepared in the right was ....clean and super tasty !

Fine memories of samosa chat, dhokla chat and kachori chat are associated with Annaras. The 3 rupees pyaaz ka samosa that used to get over within minutes of display, the thick crust samosas, the chutneys and the amazing fafda and gathiya and the papaya bhujji ... Mouth watering upon recall!!

Try the chats they have.. Despite a rather lousy service at peak times (eg: between 8 and 11 am), they manage to prepare amazing chats, in the form of pyaz kachori chat and samosa chat! And to top it down, cross the road for piping hot tea at ATS or just walk a few feet to Sharma for the same!

An all time favourite for students and office goers and housewives . Oh well in short everyone. If you are near this place during lunchtime it is best to have their excellent savoury items. The kachori which can be made into a chat is delicious with the mingling of three chutneys , garlic, green chutney (pudina, corainder) and saunth. Other savouries on offer are samosas, chilis stuffed with potato etc  If one drops in during the afternoon hours post 4 p.m. one cannot help but have those lovely hot jalebis which the staff makes right in front of the customers. I don't remember a single trip in the last 6 years when I haven't carried their mixture of puffed rice or banana chips and the bonus is the cleanliness. The host always has a smile reserved for his customers and once you become his regulars he asks after you and engages in small talk which is such a nice incentive because its a very old tradition which cant help but make you feel very special.

There is a very good chance that you aren't very fond of eating on the streets as much as you are fond of street foods. Especially Calcutta streets. But certain situations will drag you here early morning whether you are an early morning walker or a poor morning college student or someone here to buy authentic Guajarati Farsan (snacks) before they get over. One thing is common amongst all. They are all looking for breakfast. Good, sumptuous Indian breakfast at an affordable price. 

Annaras opens quiet early and shuts late at night. It is a Guajarati Farsaan place on Theatre road. It is not very easy to spot so try "bang opposite D-oh Boy! Doughnut place".
The place sells various types of fresh Guajarati Farsaan's (which disappear at a good rate), pickles, chutneys and Dhokla/ Kachori/ Pyaaz Samosa/ Pakora etc. They also take that Dhokla/ Kachori/ Pyaaz Samosa/ Pakora etc., cut into bite size pieces, squish green chutney/imli chutney on top, sprinkle coconut shavings and sev and serve it as "chaat". For 20rs.! Anybody who has ever been to Annaras love this unique chaat (and pyaaz ka samosa) and relish it their last bite. On any visit to this place you will definitely find someone standing in the street, eating their own chat. A popular tea stall nearby (ATS) makes the experience complete. And your heart sings with joy. The Farsaan's are a great take home treat too. The Theplas are a bit over priced. 

Annaras is always somewhat crowded and sometimes very crowded. The tiny place can only handle so many servitors who all work very hard. Getting your order in time can be quite a challenge during busy hours.

I give this place a 3! Do visit of you are a morning person or dragged out of bed early morning.
