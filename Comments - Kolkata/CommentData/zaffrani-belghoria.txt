good food. specially I love the mutton korma. ambience & service is pretty good. price is in very affordable range. in simplified way, I can say it is 'সাধ্যের মধ্যে স্বাদপূরণ'.

Zafrani is actually situated near the bus stand of rath tala,Belghoria. It's delivered moghlai and Chinese dishes but for my recommendation I suggest just try there moghlai dishes Chinese dishes r not so much good.....they make a really delicious biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala or chicken tikka butter masala...for quick bite this restaurant is really good...and mainly this restaurant is pocket friendly...but ambiance is not too muck high....

First time ordered from them...the chicken lollipop is bit hard, may be because they fried it earlier...the biriyani is really cheap and the main usp is the boiled egg...which is hard to find in biriyani these days...
The food is value for money...

A good restaurant with reasonable price. Kebabs are good, so are Chinese preparations. Ambience is not up to the mark but it's cheap. For two people 300 in enogh.

Small restaurant opposite kamarhati minucipality... Cheap & nothing can be said abt the ambience....
Service is fast.. but the fried rice here is really nice, the chicken tikka pieces r giving it a different taste... ❤️
Bt the chilly chicken is a disaster..

Zaffrani is more of a take away joint, rather than full fledged restaurant. The name points to mughlai cuisine, but they serve chinese dishes too. However it is jack of all trades, master of none. The USP is low cost prices and quite a good potion. Somehow they managed to serve good biriyani and a few Chinese dishes.

Wen u don have much left in ur pocket but hv a hungry stomach u turn to all ds places. Whr in low budget they serve decent food...its a small restaurant but have a v homely feeling to it.. the staffs are friendly and the food is justified in dt price range go for the biriyanis n fryd ryc n kebabs to mk ur tummy happy with minimum pocket pinch.

Chowmein was not good at all. The quantity is not enough for a person. They increased the prices of each menu. So price wise quality and quantity is not up to the mark. Other menus are not good.

I ordered first time from this restaurant for home delivery. And you know what? The food were pretty awesome. Their food quality is far more better than Rath! They delivered my food at a reasonable time. And they took no delivery charges for this. Good job Zaffrani...! :)
                    

Edit:
Moghlai porota should be avoided from this restaurant. I had ordered one chicken moghlai porota and received a chicken stuffed lachcha porota!! :'(

I read most of the review that it's a street side restaurant but last night I visited it Believe me yes the food quality and quantity is quite good than many restaurants.We tried biriyani and according to price we thought the chicken/mutton might not be cooked well.But we were wrong both the chicken and mutton was well cooked and the food was quite light as it did not contain much oil/ghee.
I'm going again.
But one cons the restaurant is small,so might not try at restaurant.

Pretty Average when it comes to street food. I mean, occasional rolls and biriyanis are fine. But dont expect much from here.
Also they DONT serve home deliveries! (The info is wrong over here; I couldn't get a home delivery 3 times)

This is a newly opened restaurant right on rathtala more bus stand. From the day it opened till now, I have always seen a good demand for their food.
It has overshadowed restaurants like Rath. Their chilli chicken is best and I love the noodles too. They accept all type of payments unlike other restaurants nearby.

A small restaurant situated at the rathtala crossing. Its not exctly a restaurant but more of a roadside eatery. Its better if you takeaway food and have at home rather than at the restaurant. This restaurant has both chinese and indian food. Quite diverse for a small roadside eatery.
We had odered chicken lolipop, mix chow, mix fried rice , chilly chicken and garlic chicken.
The chicken lolipop were quite tasty but the pieces were really small. As for the chow and rice , the quantity was really good along and it had a lot of chicken egg paneer and mushrooms. The taste was also good. The garlic chicken and chilly chicken wer so-so, the pieces were big and boneless. Its wasnt too great but ok as per the price.
Overall its a good choice for having food at home at a really cheap price.

I think that zafrani's biriyani is one of the best at belgharia area. There are many place where we can hangout for biriyani at belgharia but this one is better than the others. I have just tried once but found that it was much tastier than others.

I was a bit sceptical at first about trying biriyani from such a local outlet but I have to say the mutton biriyani has surprised me. It was really fresh and tasty. It can give any popular food chain run for their money. Try chicken roll also.

I have been there several times, it is really a awesome restaurant and the cost is also very cheap compared to nearby restaurants, with tasty foods. Yesterday I went to spencers and I was damn hungry. My quick decision was to grab a plate of biriyani from Zaffrani. The biriyani was good with a large leg piece of chicken and an egg. The restaurant service was also very nice. It was a nice experience overall, but yes, don't expect on ambiances. Good luck.

Generally if u take a roll in other place they don't offer to sit inside. But here u can do.

Again quantity of food also right.

Only one thing they should improve their quality.

Service is OK.

The roll was not properly fried ....... some portion too high  i.e.  non homogeneous fried. Authority Should keep on their mind in this point.

A new restaurant opened in rathalla... I had ordered chicken lollipop, chicken tandoori butter masala and masala kulcha... Chicken lollipop was average and not upto the mark... However tandoori butter masala and masala kulcha were really good and taste was beyond my expectation.... So my experience here was kind of mixed... Will certainly try more dishes here...
