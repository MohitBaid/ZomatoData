First time here. It's a small joint near Barrackpore railway station. 2mins walk from there. It can accomodate around 10-12 people at a time.

Ordered Popcorn Chicken and Chettinadu Chicken Wrap. The Wrap was good. It tasted fine. It had a lot of chicken inside. And it was very tummy filling. Coming to the popcorn chicken, the chicken was not at all well cooked. It was hard. A clear no no!

A take on KFC but in a better way. This place is value for money. The fried chicken buckets are so good..both in the classic and fiery Indian variant. The prices are moderate too.
The biggest downside of this outlet is probably the space constraint. With only two tables, its better that you get a takeaway. The orders take a lot of time to get delivered. But I don't mind it as it mostly means that its being freshly prepared. Some items like the much loved red velvet cake are not available as I feel that the owners want to stick to the tried and tested stuff that sell.

Place is small as it just opened.
Food is yumm. 
If no kfc then there is Meat and Eat, come and see.
The foods are cheap and affordable.
Great deal.
The workers are sober, well behaved.

The Fiery Indian Bucket is my all time favourite! 

The staff here is very friendly. 
Quality and quantity are equally satisfactory. 

My go to place when I'm craving good food.

The only negative aspect is the space constraint .

Situated beside Puma showroom outside Barrackpore Station. 
Ordered chicken burger and fried chickens and soft drinks  , taste is good but this place is for overpriced food. And they take much longer time to serve .

This Stop has already become my Burger takeaway counter as this is the first one that Barrackpore lacked since eternity. Burgers are the USP of this place. Tried fried chicken, popcorn, fries, drinks but didn't like them as much as I would have liked. My verdict, if you are thinking Burger,then this is your place.

Food tests nice but not so much as they charge. Lil overpriced I must say. Drinks are too much sweet. costly and less in quantity. Choco brownie tests nice.

This outlet being very near to the Barrackpore station premises remains almost full most of the time. I have been here twice and was quite satisfied with their service. We ordered chicken bucket on our first visit and it was a good and wholesome one, won't say the best i have had because it lacked a bit of seasoning according to my taste. On my second visit i had fish and chips and red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream, the fish and chips tasted good but the portion was very less in comparison to the price but i didn't like the cake, the crust was chewy and the cake was soggy, it was a disappointment, they need to work on it.. Coming to the ambience, its really tiny so its better to take away rather than dining in..
