I dont know why this place has got such a low rating(3.1) but to me, this is the best sweet shop in Kalindi and one of the best in Lake Town area. Has got a wide range of sweets starting from sandesh to gurer rosogolla. The misti doi is tasty as well. The kaju barfis are awesome. Don't be misled by the ratings. If you happen to pass by this shop, you can pay a visit. Yeah, you might feel a little pinch in your pocket.

Quite an old dessert shop in kalindi...'EASTERN SWEETS & CONFECTIONER' serves mouth licking food. I especially love their misti dahi, mihidana and nolen gurer sandesh. Have also tried kachori-aloordum, kaju barfi, rasgullas, gulab jamun, etc. However, rasgullas are bit chewy. They are quite consistent in their quality. Pricing is on the higher side.

Sweet shop in our para (locality) which I keep going to. Quality is consistently good. I like their sweet curd, bonde, kheer kadam, chamcham and many more. Wish the prices were lower. Note : This is in Kalindi which is close to Lake Town.
