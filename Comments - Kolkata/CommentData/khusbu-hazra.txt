Location: Opposite Basusree Cinema.

Discovered this place while returning home. This hole in the wall is quite small and has a couple of stools along with a wall-side table and serves decent quality of food. The aroma of the wok-preparation simply lured me here. And, since it was already past my usual dinner time, was quite hungry so called for Hakka Noodles (full). Yes, you read it right, this place has half-full options.

- The Hakka Noodles was prepared in a street-style indianized way having a zing of smoky flavor and wok-tossed along with fresh veggies on high flame. Visually didn't appeal me much and put me in a doubt about the taste, but, it tasted good! 

I got a half portion of Noodles packed for myself to eat late in the night when hunger calls amidst my work.

• Hygiene levels are a bit on the lower side.

Prices are super pocket friendly.

Overall was a decent experience.
- Would drop by when I crave for such a type.
