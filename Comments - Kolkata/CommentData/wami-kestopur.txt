Kestopur area is really developing with a great pace..a lot of good food joints are recently opened here, one among them is this place, so all the momo lovers can come here during their evening walks for good quality and variety of momos ..This place serves a very pocket friendly item here.. it doesnt let us miss the presence of wow momo in our area.

this is a new outlet and is doing pretty well at it.  Located at a walking distance from VIP , this one has its charms. The food I ordered was grilled chicken burger, which tasted nothing like it sounds but tasted good. The filling was bursting with cheese and mayo and was filled with veggies and shredded chicken.  The serve momo burgers, french fries, combo meals and momos as well. Pocket pinch for the budget was only 60 rupees. fulfilling, delicious and worth the money.
