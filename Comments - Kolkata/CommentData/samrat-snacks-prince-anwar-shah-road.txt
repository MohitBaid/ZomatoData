Located in lords more. They sell a wide range of snacks. Perfect for tea time. Their chicken cutlet is much in demand. The preparation is spicy yet yummy. Do try out their varieties of chops and cutlets.

Best fast food joint of Lords Bakery More. Mughlai, fish fry, mixed noodles and fried rice and rolls are must haves out here.   Only drawback is the time taken to serve as they are always having a huge queue of customers though it's of course a result of great food being served at quite a reasonable rate.

This place is located in my neighborhood and therefore I am quite a regular customer. They are a decent outlet for takeaway food. The food is good, and not pricy at all. However, it would be good if they pace up their services a bit sometimes.

I've been enjoying food from this joint since I was a little girl, the portions and the quality of the food is intact and that's what's so special about this place. A very pocket friendly eatery for your fast food cravings. I've usually had snacks and Chinese from this place, never dabbled into the mughlai cuisine apart from the occasional kebabs, really recommend people to try out this place if they aren't too health conscious and just want to please their palate.

Would recommend having the chicken cutlet, fish chop and the fish fry for starters. Mixed fried rice with the chicken Manchurian for the main as the mixed fried rice had generous chunks of prawns, eggs and chicken which you can taste with every spoonful. Value for money üëç

An economical fast food joint,located at Lord's crossing right next to the iconic Kalpana Mistanna Bhandar.
The preferred option is to have your food packed and taken away. From evening onwards, patrons flock here for their fried items and dinner dishes.
The Fish Fry,Fish Roll and Chicken Cutlet-have good filling and are the best sellers here.
The Moghlai paratha and kathi rolls are decent.
Chinese food here is typical Bengali Chinese available at most places with Chilli Chicken being the main attraction.

A shop associated with nostalgia. Grew up having snacks from here. There was big gap in between due to my shifting to a new house in other part of the city. Yesterday happened to visit the area and couldn't help reliving my childhood again. The taste is still the same and even the quality. Probably only thing which needs to taken care of is the amount of oil used for frying. I had to use paper napkin to wipe off the surface oil from the food. 
Fish chop and chicken cutlet is highly recommended

Samrat snacks is one restaurant i frequently order when lazy to cook or for parties. It offers lip smacking food at convenient prices without making a hole in the pockets! 

in the menu we have tried almost their Chinese and Mughlai dishes and I recommend to order both of them. 
My favourite is chicken biryani and their chicken tikka. I love the fact their biryani is kolkata style so those who like Hyderabadi chicken biryani. 

Overall my experience is 4/5! I highly recommend this outlet to anyone living in south city complex. Perfect for party orders ;)

I have tried their Chicken roll, good quality paratha and sufficient amount of Chicken in it.

Good value for money. Decent price.

They offer very good Chinese items with very pocket friendly rate and good quantity. Mixed fried rice most preferable item as it contains huge number of prawns & chicken. Generally i avoid Biryani from here as there are 2 more Biryani giants close to Lords more.

Overall very pocket friendly good items.

Chicken cutlet was something i tasted for the first time and found it pretty delicious. There is no place to dine in although chairs are there but no tables. Mostly people pack their food here. Would recommend people to try fast food items like cutlet, rolls etc.

If you are looking for the old Calcuttan Chop-Cutlet culture, the best place to drop by on Prince Anwarshah Road is Samrat Snacks. This shop occupies very little place on a bustling pavement of Lords More, and has been around for ever. I have been eating food coming out of their fryers for almost two decades now. Some of my favorite picks from the menu are- the chicken cutlet (always on top), the chicken pakora, the mughlai, the fish fry, the rolls and also the mutton biriyani. Though the biriyani is not out of the world, it does not disappoint gravely either. But, the fries manage to hit the ball out of the park. 
In case that you have not yet managed to get your hands on any of their fries, it is time you do. Do not forget to order the chicken cutlet.

Samrat Snacks is a small delivery outlet located at the Lord's crossing in Prince Anwar Shah Road. The place as most have witnessed remains too crowded at the evening. Coming to the food, their "Kolkata" Chinese dishes are lipsmacking and my personal favorites are the Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken dry. However, their Biriyani is too oily and does not seem to churn out the flavor it is supposed to be. The snacks like Fish Fry and the Rolls are good enough and above average compared to the joints of their sizes. All in all, the place caters well as a quick solution for food ! :)

A great place to devour Kolkata street food. The best is the fish roll filled with ample amount of fish, cashews and raisins coming to your tastebuds at every bite. The fish chop, chicken and mutton rolls are very good too. The Kolkata fast food is very oily and if you consider it is unhealthy for the long run. So is the food at Samrat. Still, the food here is yummy. Do give here a shot anytime you pass by Prince Anwar Shah Road. Located at the main Lords More. Definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)

Fried Rice and Chowmein are on the non oily side (just like the snacks items). The side dishes are pretty reasonable (neither exceptional nor bad).
Momos and stuff are also good. The service for home delivery is pretty fast. 
With a shallow pocket, or if living close by one may try out the stuff from here without much disappointments.

I was surprised that Samrat did not have anything fish related on their Indian menu. When I say fish related I mean like a curry/ masala and not a fry or roll. 
I don't eat meat, so it's fairly impossible now for me to order for something not Chinese from Samrat. 

To add insult on injury, the person on the end of the line hung up on me before I could ask him for other take away alternatives. Hmmmmph!!!! 

A disappointing 1 on behalf of customers who want to eat your food but cannot because people hang up on you!!!! 
And here I was looking forward to eating the biriyani (yes I just eat the biriyani rice) based on the lovely reviews on TOI. 

Samrat powers-that-be. Take note and add a fish item on your menu!!! Maybe train your people on basic customer service no matter how busy you are!

Located at the Lords Bakery Crossing, this is the best place to have snacks. Mind you, it is a roadside shop, and you have to eat either standing or sitting in a bench. But the snacks are so good that you'd be gorging on them. I used to be a regular at Samrat during my years of stay at Lake Gardens. They make the best Chicken Roll and other cutlets in that area. Their noodles and chilli chicken are also good and delicious, from a snack's corner's standpoint.

It's a small takeaway joint located at the Lord's Bakery More.The food is delicious.Be it the fish roll or the chicken cutlet or the hakka noodles or the chicken tikia,everything tasted delicious.But the standout dish is definitely their Special chicken mughlai paratha.

I've tried their Chicken roll, Egg Chicken Roll, Special Chicken Roll and Special Mutton Roll. They were awesome, and probably some of the best I've had. However, the place is not very hygienic and/or healthy. It's situated directly on the main road, so the atmosphere is dirty.

Been having rolls here since I was a kid. The rolls here are amazing. Quantity of food is quite reasonable. Their mixed noodles and egg chicken roll is fab.

I had ordered home delivery from Samrat today and as it is mentioned in Zomato I called up at 12pm for the order and u was promised that I will get the delivery by 1pm. At 1pm I gave a call regarding the time it will get delivered and I was promised to get it by 1.15pm and till 1.30 I waited and then again called and the order taker picked the phone and kept the phone without answering for 5 mins and then disconnected and after that they dint respond my call.. I would tell everyone out there don't opt for this restaurant ever.. 
By far the worst delivery joint I have witnessed in Calcutta...

Okay lets do this.

Samrat has two outlets . The one in golfgreen is the main one and has decent seating arrangement, the one in Lords "more" is nothing more than a takeaway counter. So nothing much to say about the ambiance except the street dogs there are a bit vicious.¬†

The food is the real star. Portions are HUGE. At least they used to be before the latest series of price-hikes and portion reductions.
Still the quantity is respectable.
The chicken cutlet and fish roll are delectable. I mean like best in kolkata delectable.The chili chicken is an abomination. Beware that sweet sticky pretender of a dish.¬†

Service is prompt.Best of all its still pretty cheap.

The food is just too good . This is mainly due to the use of palm oil in cooking which remains in liquid form every after reaching room temperature. Anyway, the tikkia roll the hot garlic, chilli, Manchurian and on request burnt ginger chicken are simply awesome and worth the penny . Its simply forknspoon lickin good .

It has been my favourite place since moving to lake gardens 12yrs back. Now there r many food stalls in Lords more, Samrat is the most frequented. It's a small shop bt dere's lot on the menu. Chicken roll is my favourite. Also vegetable chop, Chicken cutlet,Fish fry r worth trying. Fish roll is famous here. I also lyk dere chicken kebab.biryani is good for the price. 
Overall value fo money. Best in dis locality.

Street food at its best! Had chicken and egg roll.it was absolutely delicious with the right type and amount of masala ie seasoning. chicken roll was very heavy... its a lunch in itself... must try the egg roll... Also I requested for  the oil content to be not too much n they did follow exactly that.. so it was great!

Undoubtedly the second best fish fries in the city after Bijoli Grill. I drop in almost every week and I love the taste. However, it is NOT a place for the fine-dining lovers and hygiene freaks - this place is situated practically on the main road. The pavement is way too dirty :/

We are a huuuge fan of Samrat Snacks. Their food is finger-licking good. Of all the places, we find the fish roll awesomely good. Their portions are good too! 100 bucks for chicken biriyani and 110 for mutton biriyani and the portions are good! Their home delivery is good too. Prompt and really fresh food.

Recently i had their chicken roll. It was brilliant to say the least!!! The paratha was soft and flaky and not oily at all.The chicken pieces were well prepared,decent sized and had the right amount of spices in it. I prefer my rolls with a dash of lemon and generous amount of chopped green chillies.That is exactly what i got.Pure bliss.:)

This review is based on my experience at sampling the food from both the outlets of Samrat Snacks.Yes, folks they have opened another outlet on Prince Golam Mohd Shah Road(P.G.M.S.Road).It is located behind the laundry outlet-"Calcutta Wash".For the uninitiated P.G.M.S Road is the one that takes you to Golf Green from Lords Crossing.This new outlet is much cleaner,less crowded and well-stocked.Recently sampled a plate of fish finger-6 pieces(Rs 80/-) and the good old vegetable chop(Rs 7/-).Both the items were well-made and quite fresh.The fish used was basa but of good quality.The outer coating  of bread crumbs for both the fish finger and veg chop was slightly tough and hard.But that is a minor glitch.After all one cannot expect much finesse from street food akin to classy joints.
My earlier experiences from the PA Shah outlet was also satisfactory.The rolls,fish fry and the cutlet are good enough.Though as suggested by my fellow foodies am yet to lay my hands on their forte i.e. fish roll.But that shall be very soon.

This is a small food joint at Lord's More. Lord's More is an area where there are a multitude of food joints starting from sweet shops to snacks joints and Samrat is one of them. It sells a wide variety of snacks - rolls,cutlets,parathas,chowmein, fried rice etc.  This fast food restaurant enjoys a lot of foodies from the time it opens till its closing time. There is no seating arrangement as such and one has to stand and place the order. Consider this as take-away joint. The taste of the food is good and price reasonable (two good reasons why people pay visit to this place.)

This take away joint has been around for over 15 years now. My all time personal favourite has been their chicken roll and moghlai paratha. It has some benches where you can sit and eat but its better to take away. They also do home deliveries in the area. Try it if you are near the Lake Gardens - Prince Anwar Shah Road crossing. Its a small strip next to the big sweet shop New Kalpana Mistanna Bhandar.

The variety of gastronomic preferences across Kolkata has led to the formation of many quick service restaurants that offer rolls, chops and munchies at quite reasonable rates. These restaurants have evolved to cater to the changing lifestyles of the youth.  Fast food is all in rage these days. Fast food tastes good; it is also very cheap. Unfortunately, fast food comes loaded with enough calories, sodium and fat that take a toll on your health.  But for the time being if we can keep the health issue aside, we can surely consider a very popular quick service restaurant in Kolkata that serves lip smacking snacks at very reasonable rates. Yes, I'm talking about Samrat Snacks.

Located opposite South City Mall, Samrat Snacks is a small snacks bar that sells a wide variety of snacks- from yummy rolls to cutlets and from mouthwatering parathas to Indianized chowmein, fried rice and various Chinese preparations of chicken.  Rich and oily biryani and Moghai chicken preparations are also available over the counter. This quick service restaurant enjoys a lot of foodies from the time it opens till its closing time.  Rolls and cutlets sell like hot cakes.  Though I'm not a diehard fan of fast food, I still decided to try a few snacky varieties here. It was the crowd that drew my attention. What is so tasty about the food that the whole crowd of foodies throng at the counter to enjoy their fill? With this conjecture, I dropped in one day, casually, just to try a few titbits.  There is no seating arrangement here. Of course, I had to stand and place my order. My intention was to carry my food home. 

I ordered an egg chicken roll and asked the man over the counter to pack me a chicken special Moghlai paratha, chicken kabiraji, chicken biryani and chicken do pyaza. There was no harm ordering more because the price was quite low. The chicken roll tasted awesome, though not a healthy option for your regular diet. At my place, I tasted the paratha, chicken kabiraji, chicken biryani and chicken do pyaza. Although the food was cooked in loads of oil, it tasted delicious. I practically devoured my food. But, at the same time, I realized that this should not become my regular eating habit. I will not only add a few extra pounds, but my poor, tortured liver will start complaining. Nevertheless, once a while indulgence is tolerable. 

At Samrat Snacks you can also get Chinese Combo pack, Indian Combo pack and Lunch pack at very affordable prices. Office goers often opt for their lunch pack, which comes at Rs.50/- only.  If you want to pamper your taste buds, once a while, with something awesomely tasty but unhealthy, then Samrat Snacks bar is the right place to hover.

If you do not mind the fact that this is strictly takeaway and the oil which has been used to fry is probably been there a while. However, one word for this shop - FISHROLL!!! The fish roll is incredible - they make a completely addictive little thing, and I would be standing outside the shop ordering two at a go, because one for me is not enough. They also make a fairly decent roll, and fish fry, but they all pale in front of the fish roll. The moglai paratha is also pretty good, but seriously, if you are here, check out the Fish Roll. Its worth every cent.

Food coming out from a little passage can never be complained about too much. Though this place i have been visiting for over 15 years now. They whip out good rolls but what i personally find amazing is the Fish Roll. It is absolutely to die for!! Even if you find everything too basic to try, just try the Fish Roll. Remember it, FEESSHH ROOOOLLLL. This big fat crumbly thing full of fish and also added cashews and raisin to give that complete food experience. Yes of course their Moghlai Paratha is also yummy! It's something you can enjoy sitting right over there on the benches of the footpath!
Overall a cool small place pocket friendly place you could catch a quick bite from!
Cheers!

This place is a small outlet that I have frequented for over 12 years. Their rolls and moghlai paratha's are pretty good. However its best for takeaway as there is no seating available. Their egg chicken roll and egg mutton roll are both good for a quick bite. My personal favourite however is the Special Chicken Moghlai Paratha. This has pieces of chicken kebab placed in the egg mixture before the paratha is folded and fried and is delicious. Served with salad and a gravy aloo ka  subzi , its a sinful meal loaded with oil and calories  but well worth the guilty pleasure it affords. Pretty pocket friendly as well !

This was one of our favorite fast food joints near our school, Ram Mohan Mission. The egg, mutton, chicken rolls here are quality controlled. Service is also fast. These people make an amazing Chicken Cutlet. You could also take the chicken kabab which is a steal at Rs. 75. There are 15 pieces of meat in that dish and none are too small. try to avoid the fish though. Special suggestion would be the Lachcha paratas. The prices are a bit higher than average but all are in tune with the local neighborhood. 

Chakraborty Tip : This place should be your pick since all the nearby shops are always flooded with customers and for some reason this place never is.
