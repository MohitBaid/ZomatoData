Overall - 4.5 ... Huge Quantity (pocket friendly), Rich Menu , Great Taste.

Food -- 4.5...
Quantity -- Every item is at least DOUBLE the quantity what is generally provided at this rate. 

Quality -- Any item you order and you gonna appreciate the taste. 
Fish items are just delicious ; Fish Tikka and Fish Banjara are my favourite .
Prawn items are average.
Badshahi Kaju Chicken recommended for sweet taste while Balti Chicken for spicy lookout. 
Do try the Shahi Biryanis , it jumps to the level of Arsalan on some days.
You can also try the Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice some day. 

Ambiance- 4.5 .. Clean and peaceful . Gets full occupancy and crowded during dinner time on holidays.

Service - 4.5 ...Polite and professional , I am a regular as I stay nearby so I get a family kind of feeling here during my visits. 

Location -- 3.0 A bit far from bus stand and Railway Station . So reaching here is a bit tardy.But perfectly located on main road , so very easy to find for private vehicles.

Calcutta bistro is located on Jadavpur area opposite kpc collage. The restaurant consists two floors. Their sitting arrangements ,interior decoration ,and their staffs are really very good. They created a comfortable atmosphere for us. Now am coming to food. We ordered mainly Chinese items like two egg fried rice ,one plate of Mongolian chicken ,one plate of kung pao chicken. The quality of the food is great but the quantity is not as good as we expected. But I think they should be improve their food quantity. So I think Calcutta bistro is good for one time visit.

Here you get delicious food in a reasonable price range. Decor is basic. We ordered Garlic naan, Plain naan, Tandoori chicken, Chicken Reshmi Butter masala, Chicken tikka butter masala and Fresh lime soda. The tikka butter masala was absolutely delicious! Rest tasted good too.
Service was slow. They took really long to serve.
Moreover, as students of KPC Medical College and Hospital, we get discount on the food price i.e, we don't need to pay the additional tax on showing our college Id cards. So, that's some cool benifit.

Gravy chow I felt could hve been with more veggies and little more gravy..2 of my vegetarian friends had chilly paneer which was excellent too.. overall its one of the best place to visit as a student becaz u get a great quantity of authentic food at a pocket friendly cost.

This eatery in Jadavpur is known to be quite popular with students. I selected this place over Bawarchi for a post-semester dinner based on it's higher Zomato rating,4. 0. We ordered both Indian as well as Thai dishes - among Indian, were Navratna Pulaao and Balti Chicken and choice for Thai were Pad Thai noodles and Stir fried chicken with broccoli and oyester sauce. We had crispy chilli baby corn as starter. The bill was priced at ₹950/- for 4 people.

What I must point out is superiority of Indian dishes over any other chicken and the decent quantity served. Pulaao was sweetish with a variety of veggies and kaju(cashew), kishmish(raisins). Balti Chicken comes in a cute looking small bucket - it's a visual delight. And the quantity of noodles served - My Gawddddd, even two people with enormous appetite cannot hog down a single plate of it. But pad Thai trumps in terms of quantity, not quality - it's just the run of the mill stir fried noodles. I'd strongly recommend against it. Pieces of chicken were juicy, succulent, dipped in rich gravy. In Stir fried chicken with broccoli and oyester sauce, the sauce is added in generous amount. The starter was also quite appetizing - more so after a long wait.

The main drawback is scarcity of tables and hence, a long waiting time. We had to wait for about 45 minutes straight.

For students like us, who are on a budget, this place is highly recommended. Try their Indian dishes. Earlier they offered 20℅ discount on producing student ID which have been discontinued. Yet, in all, it's a decent place to dine at.

This eatery is present in Sulekha more just beside Indian Oil petrol pump. We have heard that this is a place for students and as we entered we saw most tables are filled with students only. The place is 2 storey building. We were seated at a place which we didn't like. 
Coming to the food we ordered,
Caribbean Drumstick in starter which was good 6 pieces. It was best among the all. The sauce was spicy and drumstick was crisp.
Drunken Noodles And Hunan Fish in main course. Drunken Noodles is made of pasta noodles. It was nothing amazing but edible. Also pasta noodles can be taken in small quantity but they gave lots, hence that spoiled the taste after sometime. Coming to Hunan Fish, it was the worst among the all. The gravy tasted like starch and had no taste or spice.
But this outlet is pocket friendly and good for starters and snacks.

The best fine dining restaurants in this part of the city! It is always full house at Calcutta Bistro both on weekends and weekdays. 

You must try their mouth watering appetizers and pamper your family with the finest chinese dishes. The Fish preparation, battered with cajun sauce is the perfect for a winter evening along with your favourite drink. The best part of this culinary destination is that there is no hanky panky over the communication of availability of a particular item. They would make sure that booth you and tummy is satisfied and contented at the end of the meal.

The service is worse than government offices. The waiter was deaf to our requests. The order was taken 30 mins ago yet the food was not served. Finger bowl was not given only in spite of continuously asking for the same. The waiter was rude and un-cooperative. And also they did not provide us student discount after showing the appropriate discount card. I advise people not to visit this place ever. Close your restaurant for the good of the people.

Also, their delivery is extremely fast and service is prompt.

Amazing food. The Fish Moffato had an authentic Thai street food feel to it, with the tender fish and the crispy garlic which just melts in your mouth. The Singapore fried rice, with huge chunks of chicken, eggs and prawns, was a delightful experience. The Kung Pao chicken too was quite beautiful, with succulent small chicken pieces and perfectly done peanuts. The virgin Pina Colada on the side was okay too. And at a price tag this low, it's basically a steal. The ambience is not the best, and there is a lot of crowd, and talking, but as soon as the food comes, I promise, you won't notice them at all!!! Highly recommended!!!

We even thought of apologizing for our delay. The service men were too good and polite as they took our orders and served them fast. I loved their Chicken Rashmi Malai and Kadhai Paneer in the Indian side. We had also ordered mixed singapore rice noodles and garlic chicken. They were equally good. Keep up the good job team!

We ordered Fish Moffato,mixed fried rice and Kung Pao chicken,virgin mojito and a drink called Out of Control. The fish was extremely tasty. The chicken was good. But the dissapointment was the rice. It had a huge portion of rice with very little of chicken and prawn. The virgin mojito was a little too sweet and the Out of Control was good.

Now lets come to food - we had ordered 2 chicken fried rice which tasted awesome and was enough for 4 of us. The hunan chicken and sechezwan chicken served can't even be described in words. 
The cost is moderately good for the pockets but worth it.
The service is also pretty good enough.
I would definitely recommend this for having a quality time with friends.

I absolutely love this place ! I've visited this place a lot of times, this is the first time I'm writing a review on it. Located just behind the petrol pump in Sulekha more. Pretty nice ambience and friendly staff. Coming straight to the food , we order chili crispy baby corn and fish moffato for starters, both were equally amazing. For main course we ordered two chicken dishes, buttered noodles , rice noodles manchurian chicken and fried rice. For dessert we took ice-cream. Amazing and affordable food.

Calcutta Bistro serves good food both in terms of quality and quality. The location of this restaurant is also quite convenient and is usually crowded with students most of the time. Staff behavior is also courteous which is a definitely good thing. Ample varieties are offered in the menu both in Chinese and North Indian fares. A must-visit if one happens to be nearby.

I used to go in calcutta bistro.. but the food of 25/10/17 was terrible.. they usually provide good food with good quality.. but on that day we ordered THAI CHICKEN BASIL FRIED RICE,BUTTER NAAN,PAN FRIED CHICKEN,TOOTY FROOTY...all tastes quite ok but....when we ask for a chicken preparation which is less spicy one of their waiter told us about MONGOLIAN CHICKEN..then also we hezitated..but they said "no madam it's very good, u can take it" and as we had no idea about its taste we ordered.. But believe me it @was the worst dish of Calcutta Bistro.. aftr that i ordered egg wrapped fried rice and sweet and sour chicken for parcel. When i opened that parcel the egg wrapped rice was vry good but sweet and sour chicken was the another worst chicken preparation..chicken pieces were good but smells like medicine..

1 star. I visited this restaurant many times and I found it good. But yesterday's experience was horrible. We ordered pan fried chicken, fish muffto and 2 mocktails first. Then we ordered 2 mixed fried rice,1 Chicken hakka noodle, 2 side dishes for main course. When it was served, we got a high burnt smell from the noodle. We told the staffs and one of them tasted that. But they were continuosly saying that the noodle was fine. After multiple requests and after getting positive supports from other customers, they agreed to replace that. We waited for 45 minutes but no food came. They continuously ignored us with false promises during that time. After 45 minutes one of them came and told us that it will take more time and I can go for any other item instead of noodle. We reacted to the situation (why they kept us waiting if they knew it will take time) but they were like indifferent. Then We ordered Chicken rice for the replacement. But again we waited for 30 minutes to get the rice. They were not at all friendly and the hospitality was bad. As we have some good manners, we didnt get angry to that situation and we just finished the food somehow and paid the bill with a 50 rupees tip. I fully lost my faith on this restaurant.

We visited during the durga puja. Food was good ambiance was good. But their staffs were really rude. We have to get off our chairs to call them to take the order. One more thing while we were midway through our food they were requesting us to empty the seats and finish the food as soon as possible. This is quite awkward. Maybe they can have a crowd waiting outside. But at least they shouldn't have done that. We also have waited before getting a table. I have'nt received such behaviour from any of the restaurant i dined earlier.

Visited the place for the first time. Ambience of this place was quite similar to some other restaurant. There was nothing special which can catch my eyes. Now coming to food, chicken sweet corn soup and murg reshmi kabab were indeed tasty..but the mixed hakka noodles and  kung pao chicken were not that much appealing. Numbers of chicken and prawn pieces were very less in the noodles. Sweet lime was good. Proportion of sweet and lemon was perfect.

A good place offering good food at reasonable prices. First time when I visited this restaurant, I wasn't that much impressed.

We went to dine in another restaurant nearby but seeing a long queue, we planned to go somewhere else. Then we chose Calcutta Bistro. Heard a lot about this restaurant recently so I agreed to give it another try.

This time I was really happy with the food they offered. The ambience was also nice with young and good crowd. We had Fish Moffato and Drunken Noodles. The first dish tasted heavenly. Their Indian dishes are quite famous. Will visit again to try out those dishes as well.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (approx.)

If you're in Jadavpur and you need a restaurant that is pocket friendly and would not completely disspoint it would be this place. 
The Calcutta Bistro is a little restaurant that serves a variety of entrees. It isn't truly the best at everything but it doesn't serve food that would taste quite contrary to what it's supposed to be. 
I've been there a multiple times and I've mostly ordered from the Chinese section. It is somewhat oriental in its approach towards the cuisine but then it's also very Indian-ised. However General Tsao's chicken needs a shout out and the schezwan entrees. I wouldn't really recommend the kebabs and tandoori but then it's up-to the person ordering. 
I'm not very happy with the service though.

3rd class restaurant, very poor service, rude staff behaviour.
We were 22 person and decided to go to Calcutta Bistro for dinner.

So I called up the restautant and requested them to arrange "Eggless Naan" for 6 of us, as 6 of us are vegetarian.

I would like to mention that the restaurant had enough time to prepare the "Eggless Batter for Naan", as  I called up the restautant at 1:30 in the noon, and we were supposed to reach the restaurant at 8:00 in the evening.

Also the request was not at all extra ordinary which the restaurant cannot process.

But the restaurant denied the request in "Very Rude" manner.

The overall rating is not quite correct. I was under impression that it is an exceptional place but I was disappointed when visited. The seating arrangement is quite clumsy as the place is quite small.

I ordered Crispy Chicken, Chicken Hariyali Kebab, Kung Pao Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice and Honey Glazed Chicken Wings. Kung Pao Chicken was most appreciated on Zomato and it deserves. Rice tasted good but contained very little amount of Prawn and Chicken. Other starters tasted well but the Honey Glazed Wings were quite similar to Kun Pao Chicken with nuts and red Chilies.

I was most disappointed with the serving time and quantity. The price looks small on the menu card and it is small on plate in similar fashion. The menu card make you feel that the place is cheap but it is not if you consider the quantity. It was not so busy afternoon and the ground floor area were pretty empty but they still took lot of time to deliver the dishes.

Lastly it is a good place for college goers and they even allow discount for students. Quite cool. I missed it in my college days. This is something resulted in the high Zomato Rating. I wish Calcutta Bistro all the best and hope to see improved service next time.

Went there during the Durga Puja so had to wait for quite a long time but that is quite obvious for all the the restaurants so no hard feelings for that. The quantity overall is pretty decent and quality of food was pretty amazing. The quantity of Fried Rice or Noodles served in one bowl is enough to feed two persons. Anyone looking for quality food with reasonable price, this might be the place for you. Though the place is little bit hard to find.

You need to know this - a large group of people(more than 5) turning up for lunch will have a lot of issues unless they have the habit of having stale noodles and struggling to serve each other themselves - yes, the waiters won't do that for groups as it's not convenient for 'them'(guess who gets paid!)
The side dishes were okayish and the staff was absent-minded. 
Nothing separates this place from an overrated restaurant with no good food.

Dined in here during the Durga Pujas, had to wait for quite some time but the usual experience of dining out during the Pujas revolve around the food being stale, under cooked or just plain disappointing. But it wasn't anything like it.. We really liked the food, behavior and service was still great even while managing a rush! A nice restaurant to go to with family n friends where you get decent food at decent prices. But nothing exemplary. Plus, we discovered that they give discount to students.

Another visit, chicken tandoori full,tikka butter masala,balti chicken and butter roti..apart from balti chicken everything was very good.

This place is like a hidden gem.. A perfect place to have quality food without burning a hole in your pocket..

Location:- Near the petrol pump of sulekha more of jadavpur.. This place may get overlooked if you don't have the map..

Food:- 1) Veg schezwan fried rice :- It was really tasty.. good amount of veggies.. (baby corn, capsicum) and the perfect blend of spices.. it was not too much spicy.. but was wonderful in taste..

2)Thai fish:- A savy gravy dish with a touch of Thai flavour to add the sour taste.. 8 pieces of boneless fish in gravy of bell peppers and tomato.. it was a perfect accompaniment for the rice..😀

Service :- was upto the mark..

Calcutta Bistro had been in my wishlist for a long time. Finally i gave a visit to this place with my family. Well i went there during Durga Puja and was lucky enough to get a seat immediately on entering. The place is more or less spacious but they need to check on the lighting section because its quite dim. Apart from that service is good. Our order was chicken chowmein(gravy),murg reshmi kebab,crispy chicken,tandoori roti and blue sky. Everything was good except the blue sky. The blue sky lacked taste and flavour and was no close to what we know of. The tandoori roti was soft and i loved it with the kebab. The crispy chicken too was good and so was the chowmein. Overall i was very pleased with their food and service. Will definately visit this place to try more of their offerings.

This was my second visit to this place and you know when a person visits one eatery for the second time,right?Yes,a kickass first experience is the reason and this time,the experience was even better 😍 
Now coming to the details.
Location : Bang on right hand side of the famous 'Sulekha More',just beside the petrol pump.
Ambience : This place is perfectly done up - milky white table clothes,the pastel shade over walls,the warm lighting and the cherry on top,the roses on each table only add to the feel.
Food : We ordered,
1. Veg Manchow Soup : An amazing starter and way better than what average restaurants serve in the name of this.
2.Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice : The best schezwan rice I ever had and it came all loaded with egg and chicken chunks.A must try if you love your staple spicy.
3. Mongolian Chicken : 8 succulent,thin coated boneless chicken pieces tossed in a balanced gravy with capsicums and bell peppers.
4.Fish in Gingered Pineapple Sauce : A tad bit sweet and really flavourful dish consisting of 6 pieces of coated basa fillet,generous amount of pineapple slices and cherries.This complemented the rice super well.

|| PROS || 
👍 Standard Pricing
👍 Swift Service
👍 Fresh and yum food
👍 Lovely Ambience

Something that i have tried over the years whenever i have been to this place is Finger cut flakes, lemon grass chicken and hunan fish.
These things are just perfect to taste here. 
Havent really tried out any kind of north Indian cuisine  here. 
Food , service and ambience is pretty top notch.
I would definetly take this as my go to place. 
Maximum of days i end up ordering food from here.

 The ambiance was nice Nd the staffs were warm and they gave a good service.
Coming to the food we had pan fried chilli fish and American chopsuey. The pan fried chilli fish was awesome in taste Nd I just loved it, I would surely recommend everyone to try it atleast once. Then coming to American chopsuey, I did not like it much because of the sweet nd sour taste, otherwise the quantity of both the dish was pretty good for two.

This is very popular restro in this area. Location is easy, just beside the sulekha petrol pump. By the time we went there it was crowded. So we had to wait few minutes to get seat.
Ambience is very simple. This place has two section. They gave us the upper section. Place is small.
We chose their chinese section. As we were very hungry so decided to skip the starter. We had egg wrapped friend chicken with spicy hunan prawn. This particular was different. It was totally wrapped with scrambled eggs with tiny piece of shredded chicken. But somehow i felt like it was overcooked otherwise it was okay. And the prawn dish was spicy, juicy yet tasted average. Service is okay.
But i think they should renovate their decor.

This was my first visit to this place on a rainy evening.
Heard a lot about it 
Food is really nice and pocket friendly.
Tasted butter naan, masala kulcha , chicken tikka butter masala.
The kulcha was a bit too stuffed.
Chicken tikka masala tasted nice
and so was butter naan.
Ambience is basic, waiters courteous.

Have had food from this place a number of times and never have it failed me once. Surprisingly, both the indian and chinese section are equally good.
Have had: 
Mixed fried rice, mixed pan fried noodles, schezwan chicken, hunan chicken from the Chinese menu. Worth trying each one of these.
Tried chicken biryani (it was okayish), chicken bharta and chicken kadhai a couple of times. Good ones!
Must try out if u r in and around Jadavpur or Sulekha as this place does not disappoint.

After lots of discussion we eventually decided to go for Calcutta Bistro. This was not the first time that I chose this place and going by my previous experience and today's one, it can be stated that nothing much has changed. Definitely, the ambience has become even better. The quality of the food has been pretty same, which is really great. (Actually I persuaded my friends to go for CB ahead of others in the vicinity, and I am glad that I didn't disappoint them). It would have been even better had we got proper assistance from the person who was taking down the order(main course dishes). Since there was no assistance we ended up with surplus food which we could have avoided. Otherwise it was pretty good.

When you look around yourself nowadays,you will see a surge in prices in almost everything.In this situation, where restaurant bills are almost never less than 1000 for two,Calcutta Bistro still gives you the opportunity to fill three hungry stomachs completely within a thousand bucks. This is the best feature of this place. It provides you a wide range of dishes from the Indian and Chinese cuisine.

Located in Jadavpur,it is just about 5 minutes walking distance from Jadavpur University.It is a bit tough to locate as it is behind a petrol pump.

The ambience is quite normal - neither highly decorated nor too casual or unhygienic.It is just normal yet perfect.There are two floors and hence has ample space.

Now coming to the food,we ordered :

|| Starters ||

✓ Tandoori Chicken : Four soft succulent chicken pieces were served with perfect garnishing.The chicken was well cooked and tasted great.Highly recommended !!

|| Mocktails ||

✓ Fruit Punch : This is the perfect mocktail for fruit lovers.It is a blend of strawberry and pineapple which refreshed the soul ♥

|| Main Course ||

✓ American Chopsey : This is the only dish we tried from the Chinese Cuisine and I must say,we were really impressed with its quality and quantity. We took the non-veg Chopsey,the gravy had generous amount of chicken and prawn.Recommended !

✓ Badami Mutton Pasinda : This dish was good enough - it had three pieces of soft and well cooked mutton.But the preparation could have been a bit better.

✓ Naan : The naan was soft and fresh.No complaints.

✓ Butter Roti : The taste of butter was quite evident unlike most other restaurants these days - really liked that part.

✓ Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : This was a really great preparation. Six pieces of chicken were served with a generous amount of gravy which tasted extremely good !!

|| Desserts ||

✓ Arabian Delight : This is basically three big ice cream scoops of vanilla,strawberry and chocolate ice cream garnished with cherry and dates.Another awesome dish and hence recommended !!

The service was good enough.

Overall,it was a great experience.Hope to visit this place more often in the future !! ♥

This restaurant is near my place and based on the rating we thought of giving it a try... Though this restaurant is very much pocket friendly however I feel it's a bit overrated. I mean like other than some specific dishes the rest of the food they offer are not that good. So we ordered chicken hot and sour soup which was okaish and was a bit thick. For starters we went for Caribbean drumsticks and spicy stir fried chicken. The Caribbean drumsticks were just awesome. Then for main course we ordered chili garlic noodles, chilli Chicken, egg wrapped fried rice and Fish Mandarin. So the noodles were not at all spicy instead it had some sort of grainy texture. The chicken was ok. However the fried rice was awesome. So what I feel is that this place servers some very good dishes. Only you have to know their name. Other than those, the rest of the dishes are just average.

It's located behind Sulekha Petrol pump⛽, it might be difficult to locate it as it's hidden by a huge mango tree🌳.It is a double storeyed reastuarant.They provide 20% discount to students if you provide student id but there is certain terms and conditions (they will provide you 20% discount only from your second visit, on your first visit you must carry your students id and fill a short registration form, you must carry your students id plus that copy of registration form until they provide you Calcutta Bistro card).
Coming to  food in starters we have ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn🌽 : which was undoubtedly delicious but it can be better than this 
After that we had ordered Chicken Haka Noodles🍜 (enough for 2 people) : which was the way it should be.In main course we had ordered a chicken dish exactly I can't remember the name, it contains 6 pieces of juicy chickens🍗 finally to end the meal we had Soda Lime Juice🍹. 
Overall it was a good experience I will definitely visit it again and again...

I have heard a lot about this place from one of my friends. I first had a taste of this place when he ordered some dishes at his place. The food was very homely. It wasn't too oily. And I didn't have any stomach cramps later which I usually have when the food somehow doesn't suit me. On one fine evening, we decided to go to this place again. And this time we ordered quite a spread. I don't remember all of it. But what I have felt was that the starters, soups and rice dishes were really nice. And so were the chicken preparations and not to mention the custard which was a delight. The only thing I didn't like about their menu was their noodles and ice cream. The quality of the noodles could be a lot better and the ice cream was really not that great and the fruits they served it with, tasted really cheap as those didn't really go well with the ice cream. They go great with Puja Prasaads to be very honest. They should incorporate exotic dry fruits instead of local market cheap fruits. Anyway, the staff's behavior was good and the ambience​ was okay. But one thing I have to admit. People do tend to flock to this place quite a lot. Maybe because the food is good for the most part and the prices are not too high and just right. I would have given this place 3.5 stars. But I really like the fact that they serve good food and it's affordable. So, I had to give them 4/5 stars. All in all a great place to have dinner and to dine at.

I visited it once; it’s quite spacious, with the dining area spanning both the ground and first floors, though I would prefer the first for a better decor....incidentally, the restaurant staff too recommends the same. We ordered Egg Wrapped Fried Rice, Chicken in Hot Black Bean Sauce, and Caramel Pudding – the last not mentioned in the Menu Card, though.....infact there is no dessert section in it, only those who are regular customers know about it! I was fascinated by the manner of presentation of the rice item – encompassed in a humongous square-shaped egg envelope! It could almost be the Chinese equivalent of an egg ‘moghlai paratha’ :P The quantity was ample, though the taste of both the rice and the side-dish could have been better.

One of my most favourite restaurant in Kolkata but never had the opportunity to review it. I absolutely love their chinese dishes. Very well maintained place with sitting arrangements both in the ground floor and the first floor. Nothing much to mention about the decor, it is simple but elegant.
We ordered a lot of dishes crispy chilli baby corn, paneer in hot bean sauce, caribbean chicken drum stick, chicken in oyester sauce, mongolian chicken, fish hunan, egg wrapped friedrice, mixed fried rice, vegetable polau, hariyali kebab, malabar prawn curry, balti chicken, schezewan noodles.
My absolute all time favourite is the egg wrapped friedrice, I have not had better anywhere. I also liked the hariyali kebab and hunan fish. The Indian dishes were also really tasty but I would definitely prefer chinese. The staffs are quite helpful and polite. So a absolute must visit to have good chinese food without burning a hole in your pocket.

This restaurant is located in Sulekha near Jadavpur. The place is quite homely and has seating area downstairs as well as upstairs. We sat in the second floor. 
The menu has a wide variety of Chinese and North Indian dishes. We ordered :
1. Honey Glazed Chicken Wings- These chicken pieces are juicy and the sauce with honey makes it a sweet yet spicy combination. Tastes brilliant.
2. Kung Pao Chicken- The diced chicken pieces with Kung Pao sauce and veggies make it taste good with the noodles that we ordered.
3. Mongolian Chicken- Chicken pieces with a thick gravy, Mongolian sauce and perfect blend of spices makes it delicious.
4.Hong Kong Chowmein- This dish is served with a good quantity of chowmein with an egg poach on top. The quantity is good and is enough for 2-3 persons.
5. Singapore chowmein - this chowmein has a reddish colour and also served with an egg poach. The chicken dishes taste really good with the noodles. 
The service is good, presentation is impressive, the food tastes really good, quality of food is top notch. The quantity is more than enough. The price is reasonable. Highly recommended.

This review is for the countless times I have had food in this restaurant or got it delivered to home.The restaurant is nothing fancy but it's sober and welcoming.And the good news is they give a 20% student concession on showing id.Now coming to the food,my all-time favourite from this place is the carribean drumsticks which are really juicy with proper proportionate spices.Their kebabs are good too and I love their tandoori chicken also.In main course, today only I had their Thai chicken basil fried rice which I think is one of the best fried rice in their menu. Schezwan fish was cooked in schezwan gravy with 8 pieces of fish in one plate. Their three alarm firecracker chicken is one of my favourite dishes which is a really spicy dish. General Tso's chicken on the other side has a sweetish taste to it. Among the Indian dishes,their kadhai chicken tastes delicious. Balti chicken is so-so and tandoori chicken butter masala tastes alright.There is one dish which I personally don't like is their biriyani. Although they serve the biriyani with beresta on top and in copper vessels but I find the biriyani to be too spicy which I don't like. Oh and they serve a really well lime soda.The pocket pinch is very much reasonable here and is ideal for all the students.

This place has a special something in my heart...I come here atleast once a month if not more with family and friends! From outside it may not spark a any intrest in people but...then looks can be decieving!..the ambience is great with casual light music ...the staff is very humble and know there dishes..and are always keen on suggesting new ones! Coming to the food I have tried almost everything from the menu...and Chinese is the speciality over here ...Kebabs are good but the other Indian dishes are average. If you come here do try the Carribbean drumsticks, Drunken Noodles, mixed pan fried noodles,Kung pao chicken, three alarm fire cracker. The mocktails and the deserts are also delightful. The best thing about this place is the quality of food served ..the quantity ...the value you get for the money spend is just incredible! ..
P.S- If you are a student, you can also get a student card made though I m not very sure about do they still do it or not. Anyways I have a student card and get a 20% discount on the bill because of it everytime I come here..considering GST is 18%...I pay less then the menu rates😅. In any case it is a MUST try for everyone!

A friend of mine treated me to a delightful lunch today (probably yesterday is a better word since it's past midnight) here.
The ambience is calm and quiet peaceful with the attendants being very polite and cordial.
First we ordered crispy fried chicken (hope I remember the name correctly). It was well made and the sprinkle of cilantro and lemon juice with a tomato sauce dip really made it appetizing.
Then we ordered chicken fried rice and Thai chicken. The portion of rice was quite sufficient for two. Though I was a tad bit disappointed by the fact that I had to search quite a bit for any remains of chicken in the rice. I expected more chicken and less egg in it. The Thai chicken probably was the best dish of tge day. With the sautéed onions, capsicum, tomato and the flavour of ginger and garlic made it slightly spicy with a tangy and sweet twist. Really something wirth having here, I guess.
Overall, a nice experience.

So much hype but not upto the mark as mentioned in other reviews,we ordered kung pao chicken,chilly garlic mixed noodles,crispy chicken,out of the control mocktail,caramel custard and chocolate sundae.All together were billed for 845+18% gst=997,Now talking about the food:
 Apart from crispy chicken and caramel custard,all were nothing but ordinary and not even worth to recommend others to visit Cacutta Bistro, they burnt the kung pao chicken and the taste was very okayish,not upto even average level,noodles was just normal type, one can have in a street food joint,even some street food joints make a better preparation,chocolate sundae is over-priced and just a normal chocolate ice-cream,if you are not a money waster,have ice-cream outside,out of control mocktail is combination of mango pulp and green chilly,taste was not what a bengali toungue wish for a mocktail,so its your choice,i personally did not like the taste,what was worth to mention is the custard,it was fabulous and mouth watering.. But you should not go to a so called "famous"(read 'worst') chinese outlet just for a custard,so overall very much unsatisfied and it is totally an average restaurent.

A restaurant that had long been on my wish list. Finally visited it and man, I was missing something. The food was served hot and fresh. Ordered shechezwan fish and chicken fried rice. By the way, if you want to have tandoor dishes you need to visit after 7pm. We were there at 5,hence we missed them. The ambience was nice. The only backdrop was the shechezwan fish, which even though the fish was cooked marvelously with just the juicy softness of the fish melting in your mouth, the gravy was somewhat of hot and sour instead of shechezwan.

Went there in the evening after classes when my stomach was rumbling for a wholesome meal as i dint have lunch that day. Located in the alley  just beside the Indian oil petrol pump this restaurant is extremely pocket friendly. We ordered chicken fried rice and schezwan fish.. The food was hot. Fish was extremely good... The most interesting fact is that the prices of seafood is almost the same as poultry dishes. Never seen that before! So Calcutta bistro made my evening that day!

Located behind the sulekha petrol pump. You just see the hotel's ads from Mine Road. But after entering you will see not too small. I've been a long time ago. The food seemed good. Food Quantity was good. Very helpful staff. Price not too much. Good environment to go with family.

Location:it's located just beside the petrol pump at sulekha...a narrow lane of a few seconds walk to reach there
Ambience and staff:the restro is well maintained and the staffs are cordial and welcoming too..the music was soothing as we entered which later on changed to a different track that disappointed us though
Food: Now the main reason for being here...cause heard a lot about it's quantity and quality.. ordered baby corn (fine nice and crispy),pepper chicken (this disappointed me cause I didn't have a bit zing of pepper flavor rather it was stir fried with loads of chopped onions and garlic) and the chkn manchow soup delighted us...a thick soupy stuff wid egg and chkn and fried noodles..this was good.
Now,in the main course we took chkn hakka noodles,mixed fried rice both of which were nothing unusual but the quantity was so good that would completely fill 2people and still remain..for the sides we took Tsos ckn(it led my mood real down with it's burnt smell and taste),next was the Thai chkn(it was too ordinary with capsicum and totally non spicy)..we also took the chkn bharta which we heard a lot about..this put smiles back on our faces...this was too good..and oh I forgot the raita..it had perfect sweetness tanginess and spice.
Desserts were good..took chocolate sundae(two scoops of chocolate ice cream seated upon a bed of fruits dressed with Chocolate sauce and topped with a cherry and a caramel custard(this looked heavenly but a bit inappropriate for dessert section caust it was too less sweet..
Bill came out of 2k bucks which was worth the quantity but not quality of food!!

So, we went to Calcutta Bistro on a normal Saturday for dinner when we found out that this place has quite a popularity among the local mass. This place is located at a by-lane, prominently at the back of the Petrol Pump located opposite to Sulekha More. The place has a well lit hoarding visible from the main road, and hence it won't be inconvenient for a first time goer to locate this place. After dropping there, we were made to wait for around 10-15 minutes when we were given a table for two.
Coming to the interiors, it was decent and the furniture were comfortable too. The ambiance feels good if you are in a group as it was mainly filled up with family groups chit-chatting together creating a resonating effect of voices all over. A suggestion from my side would be to add some music to the backdrop so as to balance out this resonance.
Now, the food ! Below are the item-wise feedback :
1. Caribbean Drumsticks - One of the best drumsticks I ever had. Rich in red sauce and juice to the core. Loved it !
2. Pan Fried Chilli Fish - The quality of fish is very good. The preparation was an inch below excellence due to the over sourness and overuse of chopped ginger.
3. Chilli Garlic Noodles - Brilliant ! The quantity and the generous amount of chicken in it melted our hearts ! :)
4. Kung Pao Chicken - Was okayish ! Wish only the gravy was a bit thicker in texture.
The service was professional and quick amidst such a crowd which signifies that they are pro in handling such situations. The pocket pinch is quite low and the overall experience is very positive from my side. I sincerely hope to drop into the place again with my family !

Celebrated both Monday blues and Marriage Anniversary of my dearest friend. It was raining, so being it nearest from our place we opt for it. Our starter: Chicken sweet corn soup 🍜
Pepper Chicken.
Main Course: Mixed Hakka Chow Mein 🍝
Kung Pao Chicken 🍗 
Sechezwan Chicken 
Sweet Lime Soda 🍸
Don't know why we have a fondness for this place, maybe be both for the service and the ambience ❤️. The pocket pinch was also moderate.

Had a wonderful experience in Calcutta bistro. We had pepper chicken as the starter which I felt was one of the best I had tasted. Next in main course we had bistro special mixed meifoon  rice noodles which was just amazing. There was plenty of chicken , prawn and egg in it. As side dish we ordered three alarm fire cracker chicken which was medium spicy nd saucy. In the desert we had Arabian delight which had three full scoops of ice cream including chocolate, strawberry and vanilla which was savoury. It was garnished with date palm strips and cherry. The ambience was good and the service provided was nice. But the space inside is a bit less.

I did not exactly visit this place, but a friend had treated us on her birthday with food packed in from this place. So my review covers only the food and prices and excludes the ambience and service.We had Hong Kong Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and another chicken side dish, the name of which I don't remember exactly. The fried rice was somewhat different from the usual fried rice and tasted quite good even though by the time we had it, it had turned cold. I guess it would taste even better when warm. Both the chicken dishes however disappointed me. First of all, both the dishes were quite similar, and they had an unpleasant burnt odour. I don't know if it was an one-off incident as I have tried the food from this place only once.Prices are very reasonable and the quantity is really huge. One plate would be more than enough for two people with medium appetite.

Nice simple cozy place with fantastic "Calcutta Chinese " cuisine. Price is a big USP for them so is the quantity. You will always find 2 or 3 student groups having a good gathering here. Also popular with families from near by areas. You will not be disappointed guaranteed. Must order pan fried dry chilly fish. Fish dishes are very tasty and fresh. You can hardly find outlets serving fresh fish dishes now. But come here and order fish dishes for sure.

This is a pocket friendly joint in Jadavpur which provides great value for money. The ambience and food both were satisfactory.
               We tried out Chicken Tikka butter masala, Reshmi Chicken butter masala, Mutton do piaza, butter naan. I must say I was extremely impressed by the food here and it far surpassed my expectations. It delivered on both quality as well as quantity departments.

FINAL VERDICT- I highly recommend this place to all. Do give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Food quality is exceptionally good as well as the quantity. 1 plate of fried rice is enough to fill the stomach of two.

Dead beat found some real beats in blood after getting inundated by some lovely cates. 

The weather and our drained life made us to find some near restaurers to seek some lip slurping foods. So went for a perfect 'bistro' to satisfy our tongue.

I had been there before, twice, and this time it was after 4 years almost. Place is still the same and cosy. Food was always amazing and pocket friendly too, and this time also it has kept it's tradition. 

We had ordered fish moffato, which was bit crispy with little spice in it. Different dish to start with. Then for main course we chose Hong Kong fried rice with work braised fish in black bean sauce, which not only looked different but also made me recall the Chinese taste. 
And all of the above their service was prodigious. And  you know how much did it cost? 657/- only. And we we're so full. So I would suggest you guys to go for an exploration over this place.

I will not complain about the food and their prices but what struck me was their service.
We were 6 people and the guard outside told us that there were seats for us.
But when we went inside we were told by one of the waiters that the seats were full.
He did not care to talk to us nicely.
The waiter's name was biplab sarkar.
There was a seat for 4 and we asked him if he could arrange for two chairs extra.
The way he talked to us was disgusting
He did not care for us and just shooed us away.
We were really hurt by his behaviour and vowed not to visit this place again.

I was in Kolkata in January 2016 and my second visit was just 10 days back. This place is one place to definitely visit in Kolkata even if you are staying for a single day. The location is quite accessible as it is near Jadhavpur university. You can find a lot of college students here.

The ambience has two levels of seating. It's not a very big ambience but is well maintained. The decor is minimal.

This place has a wide variety of food for both vegans and non vegans. In the starter, I tried crispy chilli baby corn. It was really well cooked and the spice level was great. It wasn't too spicy but not too bland. If you are a vegan definitely try this starter! In the main course I had Mongolian rice with dum kashmiri aloo. The rice and aloo were well cooked. The aloo was really soft. Being a Hyderabadi, I don't really like the dum kashmiri aloo I've had. In Kolkata, I really enjoyed having it. Also, I cannot survive without Biryani! I thoroughly enjoyed the biryani despite being in Kolkata. The Shahi chicken biryani was a good competition to Paradise biryani in hyderabad! The raita and salan were amazing! I had this with fish tikka masala. Afterall, when in Kolkata, you cannot afford to miss the fish! 😁 the biryani and fish tikka Masala combination was heaven for my taste buds.

The pricing is really reasonable and you get a lot of quantity for the price. The staff was really friendly and very fast with their service. If you are a local of Kolkata or a tourist, please please bookmark this restaurant on your list! 😁

Ambience : 4/5, staff: 5/5, food : 4.5/5, price: 4.5/5

I don't know what's the hype about this place as I found it to be very ordinary both in terms of food and service.

We ordered

Fish moffato - unnecessarily spicy but tasted nice as the teekha sensation lingered for some time.

Tandoori rotis- fluffy n soft just exactly how it should be

Chicken bharta- the best dish of the lot. Tasted really nice with the Tandoori rotis

Veg hakka noodles- avg in taste and quality

Phad Thai noodles- worst of the lot. Actually it was of a very fine texture like Singapore noodles and did not taste like phad Thai at all. Probably not a dish u should order from this place

Hunan fish- unexpectedly bland and did not go well with the noodles unlike the waiter's reco.

Overall this place is not amongst the Must try ones. Having said that I would like to add that quantity to food is more than enough and all the dishes are reasonably priced. However after reading such nice reviews on Zomato I did expect a lot more from this place. I personally felt this place lacks hospitality which is evident from the overly casual and somewhat indifferent attitude of the staff. Not quite happy with this one. Would think twice before revisiting.

The amount of noodles is more than sufficient for 2 people. So, I asked for parcelling the leftover which the readily arranged. The staff was courteous and friendly. The service was also swift despite a full house. My only concern is the crowd there which is too loud at times and saw some of them really misbehaving with the staff. The management should think of having some control over it like hiring a bouncer may be.

A pocket friendly place near Jadavpur 8b. Hv visited there two times and really like it vry much both for indian and chinese cuisine . Bistro's chicken bharta is my personal favourite, hs a creamy texture and a mouth watering taste. Kadhai chicken nd schezwan chicken are also gd. Quantity of each dish is enough for two person. Ambience is also pleasant. Really a good dinning place at an average cost.

Located just behind the sulekha petrol pump this restaurant is a favourite place for the young generation especially the school and college students. Being always crowded,we were lucky enough to get our seats immediately. It has two floors with the upper floor having greater capacity.
The decor is quite good and the ambience is perfect(ignoring the loud gossiping of the groups of friends) with light instrumental music playing in the background.The staffs are extremely courteous and are well behaved and are always ready to help you.
Coming to the food we ordered crispy chilli baby corn,mixed fried rice and Mongolian chicken. The baby corn was excellent and perfectly cooked. The mixed fried rice was good and the chicken was very good as well. All in all it was an excellent experience and a true value for money.The bill was only 600/- after adding taxes(previously it did not have tax but nowadays they take extra tax). A must visit and looking forward to coming again.

A regular to this place. It's an amazing restaurant with super friendly staff and speedy service. The kababs are tender and perfectly cooked. Carribean drum sticks are a huge hit. For main course, crispy fried fish in lemon coriander sauce and chicken in black bean sauce are really mouth watering. Quantities are usually large for most dishes. This place would keep coming you for more.

We had visited this place a number of times. Tried both their Indian and Chinese cuisines. Though we love their Indian cuisine more, the chinese dishes are pretty good too. Even during the busy Durga Puja days they didn't disappoint us unlike other restaurants. 
Mutton Rara, Peas Pulao and Hariali Chicken Kabab are our favourite. Ending with the fresh lime soda which is perfectly balanced.
The ambience is average. 
They offer 20% discounts to students, which makes us love this place more. Though the discount is not available on holidays. 
If you are looking for a pocket friendly good quality food, this is the place.

I just loved their food , and that too without spending a huge amount of money...... Ambience is not that great.....I mean it's moderate.....Not very spacious, still ok......But believe me,their food is just awesome, both quality-wise and quantity-wise........😘😍..... And u don't even have to spend a lot of money also, in order to have authentic Chinese food here....If u take a full plate of any item,u can easily share it with the other person,& still some food might b left,even after sharing. Really, me and 1 of friend went there and enjoyed a plate of starter, 1 main dish,1 side dish and even dessert, and came out of the restaurant fully loaded with food uptill my throat,and had to pay only 560(including taxes n ol) for such huge amount of food..... Guys, I m pretty sure that u wont b disappointed..... This one should be in every food lovers "must visit" list......

Had been several times. Satisfied with food quality and quantity along with the price. Price is literally reasonable but that doesn't compromise with food quality nor quantity. Am a fan of cold coffee with ice cream and chicken drumsticks. Their mixed fried rice is also too good with garlic chicken. Service is also good. Only that, during puja time, we visited but the quality was not so good at all. But will surely visit again.

Have visited this place a number of times and yet it never dissapoints me... This restro situated near Sulekha is one of the best budget friendly yet superb place for fooding. Anyways this time around we ordered Butter Prawn .I must say it is one of their best dishes.What followed was Bistro Meifoon and Gravy Noodles... The Meifoon was simply awesome. Do try it once.Overall the quality is quite nice . Though the decor is juz okay, but with great staff service and great food, this restro ranks among the first line of restros in Kolkata.

This little place deserves more love than it gets.

It is a very small place, tucked into a bylane near Jadavpur Sulekha, difficult to spot unless you know of its existence. Parking is even an issue on busy days. 

The food however is some of the best I have had in that price range - both the Chinese and the Indian selection. 

If you have a largeish group of people to treat, and are looking for a pocket friendly destination in the thereabouts, I personally believe it is the best option.

To beginwith- the restaurant is well decorated having a good ambience but coming to the food quality it really sucks.... we ordered MIXED HAKKA NOODLES n HUNAN CHICKEN and thought of ordering 1 or 2 more dishes but the first two dishes (mentioned above) disappointed me so much that i didnt think of proceeding any more.....Mixed hakka chow contained only cabbage an.d capsicum that too not shredded well prawn was not cleaned properly but the quantity they served was good enough for 2 sharing 1 dish..... waiters served well but the one who took the order was busy showing his attitude and lastly they were in a hurry to push us out from the restaurant because even before asking for the bill they placed the bill....Its pocket friendly.....but i wont suggest anyone to go here.... They should try to improve

Tsos chicken , shahi chicken, special biriyani, schezwan rice, masala kulcha, and the tikka kababs were great too. But the butter noodles was too simple and was nothing special actually. Hence a 4.5

Well, the food quality as well as quantity is good but the behaviour of the staffs , especially of the managers , need to improve a lot. We went for a dinner on a Friday night and the restaurant was fully crowded. After standing in the queue for almost 20 mins we got two seats over there. But due to the "fault  in their time management", the food was served after 30 mins from ordering. I think the team should be prepared enough when its fully crowded instead of being an amateur in the service.

Had ordered crispy chilly baby corn, American chopsey non veg & Chocolate Sundae.

The orders were delivered quite soon, and the food tasted quite good too! And the dessert was the best dish in my opinion, it was very tasty and upon being served was looking very good.

The staff were well behaved and very prompt in service. 

All in all a very good experience.

Food:The crispy fish in lemon coriander was a very unique dish as it was crispy from outside yet soft inside.The bistro special rice noodles had generous amount of chicken and prawn.The spicy hunan prawn was also very tasty and the chicken fried rice was good.
Ambience:Ordered for a home delivery.So cannot comment on this.
Service:The delivery was done within an hour.
Price:The quantity was sufficient for the four of us and the bill was Rs.782 which according to me is very affordable.

Hidden away from the plainsight, this is a gem of a place for people who love oriental cuisine. Nice cosy interior, good food and reasonable pricing is what makes Calcutta Bistro a thumbs-up​ for everyone from teenagers to families. Had Kung pao chicken and chilli garlic noodles and it was awesome.

The only letdown, which is also applied for most of the eateries in Kolkata, is it's service which is quite slow. Otherwise, it was a nice Sunday lunch

Calcutta Bistro, though highly rated has never been my favourite option in and around Jadavpur.  The place is easy to locate, behind the petrol pump in Sulekha. This review is based on a visit last Saturday. The place was crowded which correlates to its popularity around. But the staffs were always in hurry though they were polite. We ordered masala cola, which was ok.  Pan fried fish was very good, saucy, tangy. The Mutton biriyani was ok, though the mutton pieces were a bit too stiff.  Non veg American chop suey was good too.  Overall this place is value for money, though taste of the food can improve.

It was my sister's birthday and she suggested a restaurant which I cant deny. The quantity of food served is quite more than expected. The butter masala was very smooth and chicken was very tender. The pepper chicken was a bit more sweet which I think you need to improve. The seating arrangements are a bit suffocating. I would suggest to bit enlarge your boot space. The service was quite quick and the staffs are helpful as well.

This restaurant is located near jadavpur sulekha. Beside the petrol pump, there is a lane leading upto the place. The food here is reasonable and fine both quality and quantity wise. 
We were 7 students went there for lunch today and we opt for the chinese..
The chicken side dishes ordered by us (hunan chicken, mongolian chicken, general TSO chicken) were delicious .. 
One of the turn down of our visit today was that they mentioned that they have student discount which were being refused to us even after showing our student IDS .

Food is substandard. nothing mind blowing. The waiters are impatient, rude and kept rushing us to give the order. Furthermore, when we asked for some of the food to be packed they refused and justified as food half eaten by us cannot be packed. They gave us a bowl and asked us to pack it ourselves .

This is a nice ambient restaurant at the heart of Jadavpur Shulekha. Went here on yesterday evening 'Poila Baishakh'.
Ordered Chicken drumsticks for the starter, which were quite nice in every aspect. I loved them to the bits.
Then we went for Butter Nun and Balti Chicken. I found them quite disappointing. Butter nuun had no taste of butter and Balti Chicken was of utter destruction which had no specific taste or smell. 
Overall I can conclude that they have a nice Chinese dine but not a good Indian cuisine

The ambience is beautiful. The food quantity & quality is awesome. The treatment of the staff is also excellent. Try their chicken lollipop & chicken bharta once. They are amazingly delicious! The restaurant is affordable too (if not very pocket friendly)

This restaurant is located in a place that would seem like a really unlikely place for a beautiful restaurant as it is. The ambiance is nice and the place is very cozy,with nice service. The food too is genuine and budget friendly. I would suggest it to be better suited for dates.

Tutty Fruity Ice Cream:
Mixture of fruits more but less ice cream..Could have been better..They should come up with more varities or flavour of ice creams..Good place to visit at cheaper rate..Chinese food and biriyani is a good choice of food

Being an ex student of jadavpur university, hunting for poket friendly food places around was the bigest challenge my student life. Bistro is located at a stone throwing distance from university, is one of the popular student hangout center. This place serves multi cuisine specialy chineese at a very reasonabl price so that it is well afforded by students. Also they provide a huge quantity for single plate. All the dishes are almost perfect, tasty and delicious but the schezwan chiken, which is too much hot spicy better to avoid during these rediculus hot sun of kolkata..

Try the Fish Banzara. This is a very unique dish. I often visit the restaurant only for this particular dish. 
And must try their caramel pudding as dessert. 
Food & ambience are very good.
Avoid their biriyani. Else all Indian dishes are good.

i had lunch here about a year ago and liked this place instantly. the highlight then was the amount of food they serve at the given price range. visited it again recently with a friend. we ordered chilli garlic noodles and kung pao chicken. to our surprise, the quantity wasn't enough for two where as in the previous time, the quantity was enough for 3. also they have introduced service tax which is a huge turn off (for me atleast).otherwise the food was good. so was the ambience.

This is a good place, whenever I visit, I get extremely pleased. Not because of the services or interiors or anything, its all because of the quality of food they serve. They all are lip smacking 😋 The best in the menu according to me is Pan fried chilly Fish. This is the first time may b I am giving them a review but I have been there 'n' number of tyms.. 
Note : Sometimes they queue is so long, that people get irritated.

Been going here since childhood. One of the most complete restaurants in the price segment. The ambience is fantastic with good lighting, soft instrumentals being played in the background. Food is great. Try Lung Fung Soup, Haryali Kebab, Mongolian Fried Rice and Butter Prawn. I've probably had everything in the menu and these are my favorites. The price is also very moderate.

Pro Tip: Don't go after 9. You'll not get a table before half an hour.

Resides just behind the petrol pump at Shulekha More. There is an arrow marking the restaurant at the pump annexed to which a narrow walkway leads to the destination. Its a two-floored spacious minimally decored restaurant.

Food tastes good in modest pocket dig. Visited the place several times with family and had an overall satisfactory experience each time. Noodles, biriyani, naan, fried rice,baby corn, chicken starters as well as the main course tasted good. The desserts and mocktails were fine too.

Staffs cordial.

Ambience okayish.

Food good. 👍

I personally like the Chinese here.It has an Indo-Chinese flavour which makes the food more acceptable and more tasty.

I am going to this restaurant for past 3-4 years now. Any occasion and we choose this place. It's my all time favourite. I think I have had most of the dishes that is there in the menu. It's a nicely decorated restaurant and you can visit here for any purpose like birthday treat or anniversary. It is very much pocket friendly. Earlier they did not have tax but recently they included tax but even then it is pocket friendly. I am amazed how they have maintained the standard for so long and how they maintain the same taste of the dishes. You must try theirs crispy chilli baby corn and Caribbean drumsticks. These two are must whenever I go there. The schezwan fried rice is too tasty. It is a family restaurant and will always be my favorite. The service is fast and the staffs are okay.

Location: 5-7 min walking distance from jadavpur 8b bus stand. In the backside of a  petrol pump. Decoration: simple but clean. Sometime a nice music or some  songs plays in background. Nice ambience. 
Now come to food: almost all fish and  Chinese chicken dishes  are nice and full of taste. 
Hunan chicken is what i tried.. and it taste really   really nice. Although red chili was there but the dish is not much spicy. For medium spicy lovers it would be a favourable dish.
Chiken fried rice is good in taste, vegetable fried rice is not a like other resturents, it includes sweet corn,  and other common ingredients which makes it more tasty and lovely. FISH MOFATO is a starter ( 8 piece per plate)...specially who loves spicy it is a perfect starter for them. Kung pao chiken in main course can also be taken...because it is also a very nice delicacy.

We had three alarm fire cracker chicken, chicken noodles and as starter we had crispy chicken and manchow soup.. Crispy chicken-- the worst thing in their menu,it even doesn't have any specific taste. Bt the soup tastes awesome.the fried noodles on the top makes it more delicious.. the rest of the items were awesome as usual..❤❤
Its our common hang out place. We love to visit their again and again.. ❤
I will suggest everyone to visit here.

Calcutta Bistro is really a nice place for dinning out with family and friends. They do serve good Chinese food in a pocket friendly price. Their north Indian dishes are good too. But I felt the Chinese is better. Cordial stuffs, good quantity. I and my girl friend usually order one plate of rice or noodles or chopsuey and a side dish to to share. Really nice ambience here. One will like to come back here again. Service is a bit slow especially in special days. And you might have to wait behind a long queue before taking your seat. Beware! It's popular.

Located in Jadavpur area who offers students' discount. Good food, decent decor & ambience,  makes it recommended. Service has been good apart from the last time I visited there, when they behaved quite rudely. Fish Moffato and crispy chili babycorn is a 'must try' dish there, crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce was disastrous, & one should also avoid pan fried noodles. The current ID card needs to be produced to avail the discount. For students who get a single id card from college at the beginning of 1st year can use it only in the 1st year.

One of the best places if you love food, if you plan a sudden dining out, and of course when you aren't willing to pay much.. as it provides THE BEST FOOD IN BUDGET! This is the most common dining places for my family.. the best for me is always Lung Fung soup and Egg wrapped fried rice. These are the "must try" ones over here. Be it a fish or a chicken, it is always well cooked and they maintain the menu names giving variations to each recipe.
I am very much satisfied with this restaurant.   
The 0.5 is reduced from my rating only because of the location, as for the newcomers it will be a hard to find. Add on, it is one of the crowded restaurants on any occasion. So I would like to request if they could accommodate more people to sit.
Otherwise, food, ambience, service is always  a "thumbs up".

The perfect place to hit when pocket is almost empty and appetite is inversely proportionate! We took pepper chicken for starters which came in a good quantity. We also took two combos - one with a chicken fried rice and garlic chicken and the other with chicken noodles with Manchurian chicken. It was more than enough for three people. Would definitely go back again for the a la carte menu. Staff was good and seating space is a lot.

Toilets are very clean. No bar but that is no issue. Food here, oh God , I can bet, you will not get such good food, at such reasonable price in Kolkata. Thats the best part. You can feel it after a meal. One more part try only Chinese here. They are quite good and you will come out happily.

This was one of my go to place, whether it's a friend's reunion, family gathering or a casual walk-in.

Located in Sulekha more, just beside the petrol pump.

The dining, the ambiance every thing suits the mood. I am amazed even after so many years this place still attracts so many customers. On weekends and holidays you might face a long queue and you have to waitup for your turn. So it's better to reserve a table before-hand.
Among the cuisine they serve I always prefer to go with the Chinese over indian that does not mean it's bad it's just my own preference. They do serve good chicken tandoori out here and its definitely worth a try. Service is good. And you will get a wide variety of delicious food. 

Overall a nice place for dining.

FInally visiting this place..it is in jadavpur area..the restaurant consist of 2 floors also the interior is well decorated, spacious & sitting arrangement is quite comfortable with light music playing in the background.. the staffs are also very polite,well behaved and supporting. Now coming to food, we ordered mainly chinese items like kung pao chicken, mongolian chicken and egg chicken fried rice..all the items are really delicious and well cooked. specially mongolian chicken is awesome . quality of food is also very nice..but one area that i feel it needs to improve is in terms of quantity..don't take it wrong the quantity is decent, one item can easily shared between two individual..but if u r a bit too hungry then u can certainly finish 60-65 portion of an item . so that might be a little disappointed things. but overall they serves a very good quality of food with in a reasonable price. so, i must recommend all of u to visit this place..it is good to have a lunch or dinner with ur friends as well as with family members.

Being a resident of this place, this is a regular food joint for me, my family and my close ones who live nearby. I myself never visited this place till 2010 until I was recommended about Calcutta Bistro by a dear brother of mine. I was completely swept away by their food in my first visit and thereafter it has always been my favourite among the local eateries. Food is served in good quantities, courteous stuff, neat and clean ambience, good gentry...they also have the home delivery option for local areas. 
Now coming to the food... First the mocktails... I tried their chocolate milk shake which is a good attempt, next among the starters... Crispy cronjee paneer / chicken, pepper fish are the must tries. In the kabab section, chicken tandoori, chicken haryali kabab, chicken lahsuni and chicken irani kababs are the best. You get succulent pieces of chicken or fish well marinated and well cooked. The starters are lip smacking and need a special mention.
In the main course I have tried both Chinese and the north indian served here. Notable among them are peas pulao and veg fried rice (served in good quantity), dal bukhara( a must try for all the dal lovers), malai kofta, Kashmiri Dum aloo are delicious. Fish banjara is a good dish where bhetki cubes are cooked in a tomato gravy and it can be ordered. For the spicy food lovers chicken do piyaza (which I have tried recently) is a dish worth mentioning. Badshahi kaju chicken is again chicken cooked in a white cashew gravy... a mildly spiced dish. The Chinese that they serve also tastes good specially the Szechwan chicken/ fish dry. Another dish which is highly rated here is the lung fung soup (I have not tried it though). They do not have much to offer for the desserts except for the ice creams but yes they serve caramel custard which we hardly get to find nowadays except in the speciality eateries. The custard prepared by Calcutta Bistro  is nothing extraordinary in taste but the restaurant must be appreciated for its effort. 
 A pocket friendly restaurant offering a nice, pleasant ambience with sumptuous food- overall my experience with Calcutta Bistro has been a good one...never disapponting till date.

This restaurant is located in the lane beside the petrol pump at Sulekha.
The inteiors are neat and beautifully maintained compared to other local restaurants in Jadavpur.
Being near to KPC Medical college,we often visit here to have lunch and also get added discount by showing student's id.
We have tried almost a huge number of dishes from Mughlai to Chinese.
Their biryani and murgh reshmi butter masala tastes amazing.
Starters like crispy fish in lemon coriander,Prawn tempura,kebabs tastes good.
Chinese maincourse has a huge variety alongwith side dishes.Egg wrapped fried,Hong Kong fried rice recieves special mention.
Also,Hunan fish,Lemon fish,Schezwan fish etc and each and every chinese item tastes good.
Freshlime soda & mocktails are nice too.
Just the only drawback is that the service is not prompt.

The description of this place states it as the go-to place after college, and it can't get more accurate than that. This place has been a favorite ever seen I entered college. I have visited it on multiple occasions, be it a friend's birthday treat or just some food cravings. 

Tucked away in a small lane beside the Petrol Pump at Baghajatin Crossing, Calcutta Bistro is a saviour when it comes to cheap yet delicious food. I am a bit biased towards their Chinese preparation, although the Indian dishes aren't bad either. 

For starters, I love the Caribbean Drumstick and Honey Glazed Chicken Wings. The latter isn't a popular choice, though I personally like the sweet yet spicy taste of it. For main course, you can resort to the Egg Wrapped Mixed Fried Rice, which is a favourite or the Chopsuey or just normal Noodles. They have a wide range of items to choose your options from, rest assured. They also have caramel custards on offer, in case you have a sweet tooth!  

The cherry on top however is the fact that they offer 20% discount to students having an id card and receipt of their last meal. Be sure to avail it, but even if you don't, the prices are fairly less!

Have been here 2-3 times before.. And this time it was my sis' birthday party!

From previous visits, Fish Moffato and Hunan Chicken are two exceptionally delicious ones here... But today we had totally different buffet which was pre-booked!

First, Sweet Corn Soup was the perfect start one could've asked for in this winter to begin the lunch... And it was real yum!!!

Then, in the starters, we had Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Caribbean Drum Sticks... And the Drum Sticks were so richly spiced and sauted so perfectly that I could help myself finish it upto the bones!!!

In the Mains, we had both Hakka and Gravy Mixed Chowmein but I prefer Hakka as usual... It was pretty average... But the side dishes were really good as the Oriental here is as always perfect...

So, Fish Manchurian and Thai Chicken both got a thumbs-up from me... I felt the chicken had a rather thicker crust but I liked the sweet taste!!

Lastly, Caramel Custard to end with a good mood!

A good place to spend with near and dear ones; and especially, the pocket pinch doesn't bother you much as my previous encounters say....

First and foremost the location of this restaurant is very good. Located just behind the sulekha petrol pump. The restaurant is a pretty big one and can accommodate quite alot of people. The ambience inside the restaurant is good although you might feel it to be a bit congested. I have been to this restaurant manier times and this time I thought to write a review . We went inside and ordered butter naan, kadhai chicken and chicken bharta. They took more time than usual in delivering our order and it consider it to be 1st of January, it was supposed to happen so , although it was worth the wait. The naan was cooked very nicely and the naan was quite big compared to the other places I have eaten. Even the kadhai chicken was well cooked and the gravy was superb. And at last came the chicken bharta . Bharta was good with lots of eggs and small chicken pieces in it and the quantity was enough. The price is pretty cheap and affordable and the quality and quantity of food they provide is enough. And the price in the menu is exclusive of tax.  Calcutta Bistro is one of my favorite restaurant . Anyone who wants to have good food can go to this restaurant :) .

Ambience is nice, very much like a fine dining mood going on. However, the food REALLY disappointed. We ordered Pan fried chili fish, which was actually not that bad. But what followed, was abysmal. We ordered and received mixed hakka chowmein which tasted like 30 rupees roadside chowmein. The Hong Kong fried rice was just about alright. But the Kung Pao chicken was also very bad. The service was dismal. The man in concern wouldn't give me a knife upon request, until ultimately succumbing. There were other things too, but there were too much to mention here. All in all, it's no more than a 2.

Located near Sulekha, behind the petrol pump in Jadavpur. Being close to Jadavpur University, this is quite frequently visited by students of the locality. So it's always moderately crowded.
It is located across two floors, with minimal and soothing decor, with clean interiors and polite staff. I've been here on two occasions and both times I've tried their Chinese. This review is based on my last visit, for a pre birthday lunch.
We ordered one portion each of Chicken Fried Rice and Mixed Fried Rice and one of General Tso's Chicken. There were two of us, but the food was too much, despite both of us having pretty huge appetites. We could only finish half of each of our rice items, and we got the rest of it packed. It had good amount of veggies, chicken, egg and prawns. The side dish was very good, slightly sour and sweet, complementing the rice well. And I had met with an accident due to which I was eating extremely slowly, but they were very accommodating.
The best thing is the pricing. It is very cheap. Moreover, they give 20% discount if you're a college student. So my stomach and my pocket were both quite happy. :D

The best place to have lunch or dinner if you are in Jadavpur. The waiters carry a bit we-don't-need-you attitude, but if you can bear with that, this restaurant will surely make you come back for its pocket-friendly delicious food, mainly chinese. The restaurant is located just behind the petrol pump in Sulekha more, jadavpur. The seating area has 2 floors, ambience is very similar to Bawarchi in jadavpur. The food needs a special mention though. We ordered one egg wrapped mixed fried rice, sliced chicken with broccoli, thai fish and lemon chicken. The food arrived in 15 mins. The fried rice was enough for 2 persons and was very well prepared. The thai fish is a bit spicy, but tastes good. The chicken items were awesome! The price is very pocket friendly as i mentioned, so you should definitely give it a try. It gets very crowded on occasions, so be prepared to wait in queue.

'Calcutta Bistro' is well known among the students of Kolkata for their cheap price and huge quantity of food. It is located near the Sulekha more, just behind the Petrol Pump. 

We went here for our Christmas lunch yesterday at 2.30 p.m. We easily got two seats even though the restaurant was crowded. The seating area is divided among two floors which maximizes the seating area. The decor inside is simplistic, though they have decorated the store with Christmas trees etc. 

Coming to food, we went for 'Carribean Drumsticks' first. The food came within seven minutes. The drumsticks was delicious, the chicken inside the batter was tender and juicy, however we found raw batter inside it, which is not expected from a restaurant of such high reputation. 

Up next, we ordered one Chicken fried rice and one Kung Pao Chicken. The food took ten minutes to arrive, but on arrival we saw that they have provided us with Mixed Fried Rice. This was again not expected from them. They changed the food immediately and we had to wait another ten minutes for the food. Now, the chicken fried rice was delicious, it was cooked well. The Kung Pao Chicken was delicious. It was made with mushroom, peanuts and went really well with the fried rice. 

The staff was polite. All in all, it was an average experience, and I may or may not visit again.

Its located near sulekha more, Jadavpur. We went for a post graduation hangout. Ambience wise very cozy and comfortable with ample seating capacity. Kung paw chicken, chilli garlic chicken was moderate. One kaju shahi chicken was best. We ordered paneer kadai which was equally tasty. Quantity of fried rice was more than enough per dishes. All in all a good place for after college budgetary party!

A birthday treat with 5 gals ,easy to locate from Sulekha,jadavpur near a petrol pump.
A spacious restaurant staffs are well behaved and helpful.
We ordered:
*Caribbean chicken drumstick(6 pieces) 2 plates- damn spicy & tasty one can feel the crunch of garlic and spicy sauce.
*Pepper fish(6 pieces) 1 plate- small fish balls tossed with pepper and garlic good to taste but the fish was very soft.
*Chicken shahi biriyani 2 plates- a handi full of  biriyani with 1 piece chicken, 1 potato,1 egg and topped with fried brown onions and cashew nuts and tasted wow! very lite less spicy and enough for 1 hungry tummy.
*Chicken Do piaza (6 pieces) 1 plate- chicken tossed with green bell pepper,onion and yellow gravy. I didn't like it much felt like having Chinese do piaza..
*Green Salad
*Egg Wrapped Mixed Fried Rice 1 plate- an egg omelet wrapped in mixed fried rice tasty enough for 2 people.
*Kung Pao chicken(12 pieces) 1 plate- small fried chicken tossed with mushrooms,onions,red & yellow bell peppers,cashew nuts and soya sauce.. good but wanted to eat spicy but this one was less spicy..
        Overall the food was good and it is pocket friendly.. love to visit again specially for biriyani's..
KUDOS :)

Bored of caramelized popcorn, a failed experiment @Inox while watching a movie, we went to this place just to soothe our tastebuds. My friend is a frequent visitor there and suggested this place out of all nearby places. In contrary to its look from outside, Calcutta bistro has some nice ambience.  The staff is really nice. My friend gave me a suggestion of the Crispy Fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce and it rocked. I can easily nominate it as one of the best fish-based dishes I ever had in Kolkata. The pan fried noodles was a little confusing since it felt like a lost cousin of some chopsuey. But anyway passes my tastebuds' standards with flying colors because of its taste, under a little misleading heading though. I do not recommend the tutti fruity I had there. The options for drinks and desserts are kind of limited. I can give it a 5 star just for the fish I had, but since I do not want to be misleading like the noodles, 4.5 is a deserved rating I believe.

One of the best and pocket-friendly restaurants of Jadavpur. The ambience is quite good, and it is a good place to hangout with friends and have some good food. I, with my friend, ordered Chilli Garlic Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and Shahi Chicken Biriyani. The noodles and the biriyani were delicious, but I expected the Kung Pao to be a little more mouth-watering. The waiters were helpful. I would have given better rating, if the place were a little more spacious. So, this restro is recommended.

One of my friends had come down from Bangalore and he was dying to have a pocket friendly dinner in a good eatery as such a concept was unknown in his place of stay 😉😁.This is a nice place when it comes to a quality lunch or dinner without a big hole in the pocket. So we decided to hit Calcutta Bistro.We were given preferred seating and the staff guided us nicely through the menu.We ordered Honey glazed Chicken wings & Pan Fried Chilli Fish as starters. I am not a fan of chicken wings but this dish simply stands out with the wings being dipped in honey and dressed with seasum seeds.For main course we had Mixed Hakka Noodles Kung Pao Prawn,Tandoori Roti & Chicken Bharta.The fresh lime soda was also good with nice mix of salt and sugar.No matter how many concept cuisines we have or concept cafes we visit places like Calcutta Bistro will always remain as favourites in the heart of Calcutta foodies 😊.

FOOD and its quantity is the USP of this place. 
I went here for a birthday  treat and we ordered  Mixed Fried Rice with two chicken  side dishes which came up to be too much for us. Nevertheless  we love eating and we were pleased with the quantity. 
When it comes to quality I feel it can be a little better. 
Ambience is OK and this place is more for family dinners or gatherings. 
Sometimes  the people around get a little loud but the place is spacious . 
Servicing is decent too.

" Stole my heart .. in 3 dishes "

And that's how I will sum up my experience in one of the most underrated restaurants in South Kolkata . And why do i say underrated , because I don't see it in the trending section no matter how much footfall it has in a busy Friday night . Trust you should often celebrate this restaurants whose most important goal is to serve good food . Food that does not burn a whole in your packet but again enough to fulfill both your tummy and appetite . Calcutta Bistro is not a new name to those who know of its value but i somehow didnot seem to manage to go there even though I have been to banzara and bawarchi so many times . And after finally having a dinner here , I have found out what I have been missing .

° Location :- You have to come to jadavpur sulekha petrol pump which is just a few walk from the 8b bus stand . At the petrol pump you will be guided by banners to the restaurant .

° Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Frankly it doesn't have a huge space but it's still manageable because it provides seating in 2 floors . The deco is homely , and the chairs and tables are well arranged . The plates were changed from starters to main course and i personally love that . When the dishes were served for the main course i found those hot and therefore had an immediate impression of how they are serving the customers . The service was really commendable . The serving time was a little over 7 mintues . I found the overall experience in this section just about top class .

----------------------------------
° Food :- If you read the reviews , there is one aspect in which everyone has come to agreement . And that is they serve good tasty food . And , that's what made me more curious . And after my meal was over i was really in a pity as to why am I trying this after so many experiences . The food was just awesome . We were 2 people and I already knew about their quantity so we ordered :- 

1. Tandoori chicken ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Mentioned to be their speciality and I heard from a close friend cum foodie that their tandoori is awesome . After I had it , I just had no other options but to agree to it . Let me tell you why . You will find tandoori in a lot of places and in almost all of them you will find some portion of the chicken burnt or over grilled . But , here that is simply not the case . The meat is soft and the flavour is original and the pieces were really big . So, if you are craving for tandoori ( almost the best starter ever ) then this is the place for you .

2. Mixed Singapore fried rice ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Another amazing dish . I am a sucker for @fried rice and this was the best thing I have had for a long time . When they brought it to the table I was awed by the presentation . Very few restaurants present their fried rice in that manner ( with a poached egg on top and salad in the side ).  The taste was unique and the quantity was huge . The amount of chicken and prawn was to my liking . Overall , it is more than enough for two and I will highly recommend it .

3. Schezwan fish ( 4 / 5 ):- Almost perfect main course . There were 8 to 9 pieces of medium sized fish balls and cooked in a dark tasty but not do chilly gravy  . The gravy was really really tasty but the only thing that disappointed   us was that it was not very spicy . Certain schezwan dishes tend to be spicy but this was not but still it was tasty and we loved it . Once again recommended .

4 . Sweet lime soda ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- I have had so many that I know and distinguish from a bad one and this was perfectly sweetened to my liking . The perfect cooler for me to end my meal . You must order this .

------------------------------------------

Verdict :- I have already spoken out in the beginning of this review that i am highly impressed and after keeping this in my bookmark for a long time i have shifted this to my must visit list . Trust me i donot wish to visit a restaurant twice unless the experience overwhelms me . All this time I have been eating in Jadavpur and I was missing out on the real gem . This is the best restaurant in this part of South Kolkata I can estimate after one dining and i am hoping to be proved right when I go there again . Till then happy dining and my best wishes to a very able and honest team at Calcutta Bistro .

I have tasted all the chinese dishes but I suggest basil rice and thai chicken perfect combination. Try Mongolion rice and buttered noodles. Butter prawn is a must try.! But I have to mention the quantity of the food is enough for 2 people to have full fleged meal.!

Use to be a big fan of this place wen I was in college.. very close to my place , nice soothing ambience and very good quality food but the thing that make this place a terrible one is the service , some waiters are really rude, and it's a nightmare how they treat people on a busy day.So now I just order from there as food is quite good and so is the quantity.. Not a fancy place but for good food you can easily try out this place, try not to go on a holiday..

After watching good reviews on zomato went there today with a friend of mine.We ordered one chicken tandoori, a plate of chilli & garlic chicken noodles & lime soda.

Chicken tandoori was good at that price range. Chicken was juicy & tender but the flavor could be better. Rating - 3.5/5

I am not a big fan of noodles & didn't like that much but it was good, the quantity was more than enough for two of us & we became really stuffed, couldn't finish that. Rating - 3.5/5

The Lime soda is really refreshing & a must try here. Rating - 4/6

The interior was simple & the staffs were really good.

Overall a good experience.

Writing this review, sitting in the restaurant itself. Disappoint is the term which could possibly express my emotion right now, though I've tried only their starters. I've had crispy chicken, pepper chicken and pan fried momos. The crispy chicken was exactly like as follows: "the road side daal pakoras which you get, so it was chicken strips fried in that batter". Pepper chicken had surprisingly high amounts of ginger and about the pan fried momos, lets just say that the roadside stalls give you better quality at far lesser rates. It had the stench of oil coming from the skin. The 1.5 rating was for the fresh lime soda which was the only good thing.
Conclusion: There are other places far better which are pocket friendly and provide quality food.

It's basically a college goer's den...they even provide "student concession" on food bill. Otherwise it's a basic restaurant with cordial service and can fulfill your appetite. Food is good considering the bill. Though it's multi-cuisine but personally favored the Chinese.

Used to come here frequently.. Good ambience.. The quality of the food is always very good.. Had a special liking for its Hong Kong fried rice and also badsahi chicken.. Kababs are also delicious..
Service provided is satisfactory.. But the problem is it's lack of space. You have to wait in the queue for at least 15 to 20 mints

I would say the best family restaurant in Jadavpur. Very decent ambience, with light music playing in the background. Very dignified demeanor of staff. Food is very delicious. I have tried the pan fried chicken momos here which were sumptuously made. The paneer butter masala absolutely lip smacking. The malai kofta to die for; perfectly cooked! The butter naan  soft and fresh. The tandoori rotis too well made. You can dine out here with your friends and family and you won't be disappointed by this place. They deserve much appreciation and also deserve the queue of customers patiently waiting outside to dine in during weekends. Keep it up guys. :)

Before moving on to the food part, I'd like to mention here that Calcutta Bistro is immensely underpriced, given its unparalleled decor, ambience (service included), and food. This should be the ultimate stop for college students as your ID card can get you a discount of a whopping 20%. Now, for the food.
We'd ordered Caribbean Chicken for starters, which is six medium-sized chicken legs, crispy and spicy (oh and delicious!). Then Chilli Garlic Mixed (chicken, and prawn which doesn't smell) Noodles and Kung Pao Chicken (super spicy!) for the main course. Dessert was Caramel Custard. The photos of this particular dessert can be misleading, as the quantity is just enough for one person, and two people couldn't share it, unlike the Chilli Garlic Noodles. Nevertheless, every item was scrumptious and it was an amazing experience.

We took away our dinner from here the day after dashami. Placed our order at 9:06 p.m. and as the place was overcrowded they took an hour to prepare our food. We ordered 2 mixed fried rice with kung pao chicken and Mongolian chicken and one veg pulav with mutton do-piaza. The fried rice was good and the quantity was enough for 2 but bits of chicken or prawn or eggs were less in the fried rice. The kung pao chicken was ok, a bit too sour which was a little off for my taste and the Mongolian chicken was prepared nicely. The disappointment was the mutton do-piaza, it didn't taste like an indian dish rather it tasted like some mutton Chinese dish as per my mother's review.

All in all the food quality is ok and quantity is enough and also on the affordable side.

This is a very nice family restaurant. I went with my friends there a couple of days ago to try out some Chinese food. We tried Caribbean Drumsticks and Pan Fried Chilli Fish in starters. Both were really delicious. Noodles and rice were also very nicely cooked. In main course we ordered Kung Pao Chicken which I didn't like much mainly because of the gravy, the gravy didn't taste good.

This restaurant is very popular amongst those youngsters who are low on cash and yet looking to have some decent good food. Calcutta Bistro saves the day for them...well sort of. I have mainly tried the chinese dishes here. The quantity served is a lot,more than enough for two people to share,although the quality of the dishes have scope for improvement. the kebabs here are decent too. Overall,apt place for a quick hangout with friends or for giving a treat due to the reasonable prices. The ambience and staff are alright :-)

Well I heard about this place for a long time but never got a chamce to visit this place. Last evening me and one of my little brother decided to have our Dashami meal over here. So we went there by 1930 Hours and the place was half empty. We were seated and were offered the menu card with delicious choices. We ordered Pan Fried Chicken, Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice and Hunan Fish. 

Pan Fried Chicken was really good in taste so was Hunan Fish but the Schezwan was very spicy. Altogether a nice experience would recommend others to visit also. 

Will be there again to try rest of their dishes. Cheers!

Popularized by college going students who are eternally low on cash, Calcutta Bistro comes out from the narrow lanes and into the list of one of the most favourite spots among youngsters.

When it comes to food, Bistro does deliver. While quantity is impressive, quality needs a bit of work on. My other complaint is the unavailability of food items and the casual attitude behind it. My first order here was their Drunken Noodles. My attendant seemed rather arrogant and a wee bit too casual about the unavailability of my selected item. Furthermore, among the variety of choices I had, he restricted my choices to just three: Hakka, Gravy and Chili Garlic Noodles.

Having no other choice, I placed an order for Chili Garlic Noodles. Food arrived on time. I was impressed with their service. Quantity was enough to fill up two and still take a bit back home.

Coming to flavours, the bowl of noodle actually tasted pretty good. However, the meat was tough.

Positives that I'll take back from here are their pocket friendly menu, fast service and obviously generous quantity. What the restaurant may want to work on though is trying to get the basics right (maybe not get the meat overcooked and tough), making available the things you place on your menu, they must be there for a reason, right? And last but not the least, putting up a smile while making a conversation with the customers.

I have been to this place a number of times but never really got the scope to review it ever. I am glad that I could finally review it.It does justice to it's name.It really is a bistro with amazing food served. This place is located in Sulekha right behind the Sulekha petrol pump. It might be difficult for first timers to locate the restaurant as it camouflages behind the petrol pump. Hence,make sure to spot the signboard adjacent to the pump which would direct you to the right place. The food joint is fairly big and can accommodate a big crowd easily;the decor is nothing mentionable.But what is worth mentioning is their food.The quantity along with the quality of the food served is impressive.We had ordered Caribbean Drumsticks,Pepper Fish,Butter Roti,Reshmi Tikka Butter Masala,Kadai Chicken,Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice,Caramel Custard Pudding,Trutty Fruitty Ice Cream,Chocolate Sundae.Each and every item was amazing.
The Starters:
Caribbean Chicken is one of the must-try dishes for me.Whenever I visit this place I make it a point to start my meal with this dish.Excellently tossed in a spicy sauce this dish might well give the Drums of Heaven of Hatari a run for it's money.The Pepper fish too was excellent and full of flavours.Both the dishes are highly recommended.
The Main Course:
The Reshmi Tikka Butter Masala and the Kadai Chicken were perfect for the Butter Roti. Both were a little spicy served with ample of gravy.The Schezwan Fried Rice too was brimming with flavours which enabled us to have the rice without a side dish.Again,all the items would be recommended by me.
The Desserts:
The Trutty Fruitty Ice Cream is one of the famous items of Calcutta Bistro and hence do not forget to try it when you visit this place.The presentation of it along with the heavenly taste makes it a class apart from the same item present anywhere else.The Chocolate Sundae was presented beautifully along with pieces of fresh fruits.
A very good restaurant with optimal ambience but amazing food.Students do not forget to flash your college identity cards in order to get a 20% discount.This student program is one more thing about Calcutta Bistro which impresses me.Give it a try,you will not be disappointed.

This restaurant is situated in jadavpur near the sukanta setu crossings but it is a little tricky to find it in the first place,as it is situated inside a lane.
It has two floors and we had been requested to sit on the first floor.
Now coming to the interior it is good nothing too fancy. It is quite big in size and also filled with so many young college students. 
The management were very responsive and friendly. They even allowed us to celebrate a small birthday party of one of our friend. They helped us a lot.
Now coming to the dishes we ordered.
First of all we had fresh like soda, followed by pan fried chicken as the starter. Then our main course was chicken sechezwan fried rice, chicken fried rice, hot garlic chicken and almond chicken.

Fresh like soda was very tasty and refreshing.

Pan fried chicken was also very good in taste and it had a tangy feel in it which I personally liked a lot.

Now coming to our main course the chicken fried rice was excellent.
Although the chicken sechezwan fried rice was good in taste but it was too spicy for some of my friend, hence some of them didn't like it that much. But according to me it was good but may not have too much of it , as it was very hot and spicy.

In the side dishes the hot garlic chicken was fantastic although the almond chicken wasn't that good.
They charge 20.5% of tax 
But overall it was a good experience and to visit here again...

I rated them for their staff behaviour. Most of them are extremely reluctant in serving their customers. We went for a lunch at 3 20 pm when the resturant had few customers still we weren't allowed to sit In a table of 4 inspite of them knowing that we had several bags with us. After waiting for 10 mins we got our bottle of mineral water and then the glass was not cleaned properly. Food was average . But the  staffs are really annoying

And it turned out to be quite delicious and something new. The quantity of rice was sufficient for one but maybe it can fall short if its shared depending on one's appetite. Overall a tasty experience.

CALCUTTA BISTRO, it’s a place which attracts me for its NAVRATAN POLAO. From college days it has been one of my favorite places. 

 We ordered FISH TIKKA for starter and in the main course there were NAVRATAN POLAO and BALTI FISH.
 All the dishes were delicious. Enjoyed the taste of "Good Food".

But in the last month we tried NAVRATAN POLAO, KADHAI CHICKEN, PLAIN NAAN and PINEAPPLE RAITA to satisfy our appetite. All were nice but the “Pineapple Raita” was not up to the mark. We missed the taste of Raita.

The service and attendance of the staff were good. We waited for our dishes hardly for 10 to 15 minutes. The romantic song in the background and pleasant ambiance made our evening nicer.

I think this place is one of those who serve quality foods in a pocket friendly rate.

Among their Indian dishes, the Navratan Pulao , Chicken tikka butter masala are commendable.

I have been to this restaurant several times and have always had a similar experience. 

I like it as a nice family restaurant which serves decent Chinese and Tandoori dishes ( I prefer the Chinese ones ). Out of everything I have tried here, I do recommend the chicken manchow soup. It's probably the best I have had in Kolkata. Among the tandoori dishes I love their tandoori chicken.  

The food is very reasonably priced and won't leave a huge hole in your pocket. I have heard about a student discount they offer as well, so do use it if you have a valid ID. 

Don't go to this restaurant for the decor or the exquisite food. Expect decent dishes like the kung Pao chicken, drums of heaven, etc.

I went there several times, but today I just share my recent experience. Last Wednesday one of my colleague's birthday celebration party was happening in our lab. So we ordered the food from this restaurant for lunch. Chicken Lausooni Kebab, Mutton Biriyani, Veg Pulao, Paneer 65, Kadai Paneer, Chicken Bharta. The best item was Paneer 65. It is a must try dish. And the worst item was Chicken Bharta. The Chicken pieces taste like rubber. It tastes like it freeze for several days. Biryani was not bad and Kebab was good. If you show your valid student id card, they give you a special 20% student discount which is a very nice option. Nothing else to share.

An amazing eatery hiding behind the petrol pump. I've been there quite a few times. The chinese they serve is really good. Ambience is good, though not the "woooowww!" kind. The best part is that it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket( the 4.5 is for that). To keep it short, one of the best in the pocket-friendly genre in kolkata.

When there are so many 4s and 4.5s....then why this 2.5.... here's in detail as to Why?

When I called up the guy receiving the phone was very prompt (forget the tenets of hospitality and gentle talk!!!) in refusing that they do not deliver at my location (Bansdroni) unless the order's worth ₹1000 (although their page says ₹500)....I was determined to get the order at my place so that technically/justifiably I could write about it....after reasoning for a while the guy reasoned at ₹700 min order, I agreed....next was the weirdest part, the first guy hands over the phone to a second guy, for a while his method of talking and tenor of voice seemed as if he's doing some kinda favour, rudeness abounded....

Now for the second and more important reason....had ordered a couple of singapore fried rice, kung pao prawn and stir fried chicken and broccoli in oyster sauce....
- cost me ₹720, not that bad
- the food was pretty avg or well below it especially the singapore fried rice, it felt like something a hostel bunch cooked out of desperation...the prawn was second on the list of the poorly cooked ones....
- the time schedules for delivery was pretty much ok
- the packaging for delivery was also reasonably good

So for two of the most prominent reasons....conduct and cooking quality wouldn't go for more than a 2.5

NB: if any joint has restrictions on where it wants to deliver / enhanced min ordering requirements beyond a certain area limit, they should mention it on their page!!!

Who doesn't want delectable platters at cheap prices and that too in a clean and hygienic ambience? Calcutta Bistro can provide you all.  Hidden from the prying eyes, behind Sulekha petrol pump in Jadavpur,  it is going strong for a decade now in the business. I would personally vote in favour of the Chinese food served by them. Prawn tempura, chicken drums of heaven, pepper chicken, pepper fish, egg-wrapped rice, pineapple fried rice, chicken and broccoli cooked in oyster sauce are some of my personal favourites. Well, I might have missed out some as the list is inexhaustible. The interiors are simple and the staff is polite. Here's to many more decades of such great cuisines.

The ambience is great. Service was really good. I just love the food. We tried this new item called the Egg wrapped fried rice and I must tell you guys it was really very nice. You all must go and try this dish out. We couldn't eat the whole, so asked them pack it. They didn't pack the whole food and we found that the next day. This isn't expected. We trust you people and you fail to keep it. You guys charge extra for packing but do not pack the whole food. Very bad experience :(

Calcutta Bistro is an old restaurant in this area and quite a known place for South Kolkata residents.
Their only plus point is the pocket friendliness.Otherwise,the food items were average.
I visited this place for a Saturday lunch with a friend of mine.
We ordered Chicken sweet corn soup which was average but the quantity as compared to other regular Chinese restaurants was quite less.
For starters,we ordered crispy chilly baby corn and dry schezwan chicken.
The baby corn was not at all crispy,it was rather hard and it was almost impossible for me to use the fork for the baby corns!
The schezwan chicken was average but the fish was soft.
The only thing which I liked was their mocktail Out of Control which had a different taste and was quite refreshing.My friend ordered Chocolate Shake which was also good.
This place is mainly recommended for a quick snack or simple lunch/dinner.

Has changed into a nice and cosy place since i last visited there in 2012. I went there with my colleagues and we had a great outing. We first ordered veg sweet corn soup for me and chicken corn soup for the non-begs and both were good. In starters I had crispy chilli babycorn and the non-vegs had tandoori chicken. The babycorn was same as everywhere else. In the main course we had Masala Kulcha and Dal Bukhara. The kulcha had a good stuffing of vegetables (better than most of the restros) and the dal bukhara had extra butter. Finally we had a pinacolada and it was also up to the mark. The service was very very good. The waiters were eager to help and they did not pestered us with "what more do you wasnt? anything else?" Whenever we wanted we gave orders. And the best thing was that i was CHEAPER and had better food quality than any other restros in the region. A perfect place to spend your time with friends or dates.

well after hearing a lot about this place, i decided to test the joint out. So last night i placed an order of seemingly random things.. 5 butter naan, tandoori chicken, chicken kungpao( as heard a lot abt this dish in here) and hot garlic paneer. Delivery arrived before time and packing was good ( no sign of cheapness).  
As off food, i was the impressed by the condition of the naans, as after certain time they tend to become leathery. the paneer gravy was good, sweet and sour with a hotness towards the end (very interesting), and kungpao chicken well it was okay, tbh am not a fan of peanuts in my chicken. And finally tandoori chicken (tandoor items are very important for me, and to try a new place i always order tandoori) was nice, above average.  All in all above average and enjoyed the food, considering the fact that i was exhausted ystrday and i still enjoyed the food. Good job

If you are at the end of the month and you want to go for a dine out, then calcutta bistro is the best place where one can go. Today only I went there with my family. When we reached the restaurant, it was deserted. We were the first to arrive. The ambience was very good and the staff attended us well. The interior was clean and well decorated. Now on to the dishes

1. Chicken lasooni kebab - an excellent north Indian preparation. Tender, succulent pieces of chicken shimmered in Malai gravy with mild blend of spices and a bit lasooni flavour. Excellent dish indeed. A 4.6.

2. Pan fried chilli fish - an awesome Chinese authentic dish. Big and literally tender bhetki basa battered with spices and gently tossed in extravagant Chinese sauces. A mind blowing dish. A 4.5.

3. Chicken tikka butter masala - an authentic north Indian delicacy and my favourite dish. Succulent juicy chicken pieces cooked gently in tandoori with a whole lot of spices and shimmered in exotic creamy gravy. A 4.6.

4. Fish banjara - 4 big and tender fish basa battered with exotic spices and gently cooked in rich tandoori gravy. A mouth watering dish indeed. A 4.5.

5. Kadai paneer - an authentic north Indian veg preparation. Cubes of fresh cottage cheese blended with Indian spices, onions and capsicums.
A good preparation. A 4.0.

6. Kungpao chicken - a fantastic Chinese preparation. It was the first time i tasted this dish and literally it was heavenly!!! Small chicken pieces gently prepared with Chinese spices topped with cashew nuts and mushroom. One must surely try it out. A 4.6.

7. Butter naan - a traditional Indian bread. Big pieces of Indian bread brushed with butter and cooked in clay oven. A great meal. A 4.2.

8. Plain naan - a great Indian meal. Gently baked in clay oven. A 4.0.

9. Mixed schezwan fried rice - a great Chinese preparation. Rice greatly tossed with whole lot of spices, chicken, prawn and cooked to perfection. A very tasty dish. A 4.6.

10. Caramel custard - a great cold dessert. Custard brushed with tasty caramel sauce. Heart soothing. A 4.5.

Overall a nice restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone.

Hmm, Kung pao was ok though, bit too tangy. Bottom line is, its a solid restaurant for pocketphillic ppl like us. Go on drop by.

Calcutta Bistro is bit difficult to locate, situated behind the petrol pump in Jadavpur. But once you are in you will get to find out its good ambiance, beautifully lit up with adequate space.
Beside the ambiance it serves really good food. And the prices are reasonable too. We ordered Crispy Chilly Baby corn as starter and then Mixed fried rice with Chicken with Cashew Nut which was really really good. And overall the service they offered us was again decent.
Additionally if you are a student you can avail the students discount of 20℅ by showing your School or College ID (any one among you will work), and that again brought down our total bill value.

The rice was too delicious and the quantity was huge with adequate chicken pieces. The noodles were perfect too with the right amount of spices. The kung pao chicken had around 10 small pieces and tasted a bit sweet.

I am writing this review quite late, the last time I visited was around 6 months back. Previously I had to visit this place number of times, quite against my wishes.

The food and the items on the menu are just normal, nothing great, nothing special, not much variety, similar things you find in most regular restaurants.

The ambience itself is just like another middle class average restaurant.

But the worst part is the people, they are not courteous nor helpful. They do not smile. It seems like they are not paid well. What I have seen mostly families and groups throng to this place, billing up big figures. And if you happen to be a single person, or a couple with just two course order, get ready for the song.

The staff will not heed to your seat request , even if you are regular, they will take time to bring the order, no customizing request will be entertained, infact I had once asked a waiter to make the gravy tighter in a particular dish, smack came the reply "Ja ache, tai paben" (you will get what we have... no request can be entertained) I was shocked!!!! And this was not once. 

But surprisingly, I see families of Jadavpur area thronging to this place. Maybe if you are a big group,  with big billing, happy with the similar food menus, they will love you.

If you love to experiment and try new dishes, love to speak  to the waiter about the food, get a wholesome experience, if you are coming as a single customer or a couple, if you are planning for a single or double course meal avoid this place, the staff behaviour will spoil the experience completely.

A nice family restaurant located beside the sulekha petrol pump.
Ground floor is basically reserved for huge families. The first floor is for the small crowds.
We were given a warm welcome. And the décor was nice too.
We ordered the pan fried chicken for starters.
It was quite good. It had a sweet and sour taste.
For the main course we ordered for the chilli garlic noodles and kung pao chicken.
The chilli garlic noodles tasted fantastic. Spicy and tasty.
I some how could not like the taste of kung pao chicken. It had mushrooms and peanuts. The nutty flavour made the dish taste horrible. I didn't like it at all. Plus it wasn't spicy as it was described.
Overall a nice experience. Just don't order the kung pao chicken. It tastes horrible.

A place where I visit quite often. Located at Sulekha crossing, just beside the petrol pump, this place is heaven for foodies. A deadly combination of quality food with pocket friendly prices with quantity just about perfect! Ambience is average but not bad at all. They thrive in Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines. Special discovery : Crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce! This takes time to prepare but is absolutely worth the wait. In short, great food in low budget! A place which is a must visit for any foodie!

Appropriate quantity and pretty good quality. That's how I'll describe the food at this place. The tandoori chicken and Iranian Chicken kebab are quite delectable. Try out the mutton dishes, Mutton Rara or Pasinda along with Butter Naan. You'll not be disappointed. The price is reasonable. The ambience or the decor is pretty ordinary but they make up these things by their service which I found to be very good. Overall a decent place.

Visited this place with my brother, on a lazy afternoon. Wasn't really hungry, however had to spend an hour somewhere, in between two meetings. The entrance is at a weird corner, however locating this place wasn't hard as it is very popular amongst the local crowd.

The waiters suggested us to take a seat upstairs as cleaning was going on in the ground floor. Apart from us, there was one more person at another table. The decor was simplistic.

A waiter came to take out order after almost 15 minutes. We ordered a chocolate based mocktail and a Virgin pinacolada. And requested the waiter to suggest a snack that we may get super quick. The waiter suggested a batter fried prawn dish (forgot the name)

The service was super slow. It took more than half an hour to bring us one starter and two mocktails. The food was okay, nothing extraordinary. The pinacolada was a bit too sweet.

In spite of the Good feedback about the food of this restaurant, I hesitate to go their again. The service was so horrible. My point is, if they were not ready to serve, they could have said that we're closed. Why let the customers come in and wait till infinity, till their whole appetite is lost.

An awesome destination for foodies who can live on Chinese cuisine.Must tries are-Pan fried fish/chicken, pan fried noodles, Singapore fried rice.The aroma of Pan fried fish/chicken are mouth watering.Going back to this place again n' again only for the pan fried noodles is worth it.The color,aroma,texture,flavor of the Singapore Fried rice is amazing.The ambience is satisfactory.Pocket pinch is perfectly balanced for those who dine out every weekend.Have developed such an affinity for the place that I've forgotten the number of my visits here.On the downside, the biryani here is very disappointing.In fact the Indian dishes served here are satisfactory but not mind blowing.The 3 alarmed fire cracked chicken is not worth a try.In fact,recently most of the red sauce based chicken dishes have been a little disappointing owing to the amount of sauce added in the prep.

The place is easy to locate... ambience and behavior of the staff deserves a thumbs up.. coming to food they r pretty much ok according to the price... we ordered Singapore rice, schezuan rice, kungpao chicken, chicken garlic.. quantity was perfect but the taste was somewhat not up to the mark.. during peak hours one may need to wait for 1-1.5 hours.. availability of dishes during late hours is also a matter of concern..

I just realized I haven't reviewed this restaurant(once my go to place) yet.

Location: Jadavpur, Sulekha more. Locate the petrol pump, walk down the aisle right beside it and voila you'll find yourself looking at a multi storied building!

On weekends, during dinner time you WILL have to wait outside. It is unbelievable how this place still  manages to attract foodies if all age groups! So if you don't wanna queue up with a hungry stomach, go early or deserve a table.

Food is delicious, no doubt. But in the span of so many years, I did however get one or two plates of under cooked dishes. One which I distinctively remember was a plate of chicken lollipop. It was totally under cooked and had raw batter. Otherwise, food is good. 

I feel Chinese is a bit better although kebabs and all are not bad either!

PS- they offer 20% off for students holding valid id card. So don't forget to ask them about it! Recommended.

Calcutta Bistro is situated just behind a petrol pump opposite to Sukanta Setu in Jadavpur. As it is not visible from the main road, initially it was difficult for foodies to know about it existence. But now it has made a name for itself to pull crowds from all across the city. During weekends it is difficult to get a table and the crowds gathered in front of the restaurant will make u feel as if the festive season has already arrived.

Mouth watering Chinese food at a very reasonable rate is the main attraction of this restaurant. We had ordered for Spicy   fried chicken and cashew nut, Fish in chilly honey sauce and Fried prawn tempura. For main course we ordered Mixed gravy chowmin, Schezwan fried rice and Kung Pao chicken. All of them were cooked with perfection and was indeed a delight for the taste buds. The quantity was also good. 

They have a cosy interior and service is also decent. It was a get together with our beloved cousins and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening in Calcutta Bistro.

The ambiance here is cozy and comfortable and the staffs are warm and courteous too. Though I left the chairs to be little closely placed. Food served here is very tasty and well cooked. Pan Fried Chili Fish was soft and the thickness of the cornflour coating was just perfect, not that thick too which one generally finds at a standard restaurant. Hunan Chicken served was good too.

What we ordered - Pan Fried Chili Fish, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken, Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce

This is so near to my house yet this is my first time of visiting. 
The interior is classy with well decked tables and soothing music playing in the back. 
The service is well grand. Each of the waitors were very well behaved and cordial. The food was awesome..we ordered crispy chilli babycorn, masala kulcha ad badshahi kaju chicken to experiment on both indian and chinese cuisine 
The babycorn was crispy and well cooked tossed in medium spicy sauce. I loved the preparation. 
The masala kulcha was hot and stuffed fully unlike other places and the chicken dish was out of this world. 
I loved the food over here. And the serving was great too
I would definitely visit this place once again to try out other dishes.

Calcutta Bistro has been a wonderful experience. The lehsun chicken Kabab is succulent and flavourful. The quantity of mixed rice and singapore rice was more than enough. The Kung Pao chicken was delectable but the almond chicken in lemon sauce was a disappointment as it was too sweet and did not really have any flavour. The tutti-frutti and the cream custard caramel was a winning finish to our long lunch. The ambience was soothing and understated with soft music playing in the background. Love the decor.
The prices are really affordable and reasonable enough. I am looking forward to my next visit again.

This eatery is located at sulekha crossing,just behind petrol pump.two wheelers can be parked infront of the restaurant but for the four wheelers, those have to be parked on raja scmullick road. 
This eatery has a decent deco.sitting mostly arranged on the first floor & they dont have an elevator.i had asked for chicken stir fry for the starter & butter noodles,chicken with cashew for the main course.foods were tasty,serving time was really quick,quantity was really appreciable.pricing was moderate.butter noodles is a must try item.

We ordered haka mixed noodles & mixed gravy noodles along with a couple of chilli chicken sides.. The delivery was prompt & the pricing very reasonable. The amount is a lot & i mean one portion would be way too much fr an average eating person..taste was so good esp the gravy noodles that i couldnt even get a second helping..😒 the chilli chicken tasted yummy too..
Definitely a place to check out..looking forward to more dinners from this place..

Its bit difficult to locate when visiting for the first time. The place is located just behind the petrol pump in Sulekha, jadavpur. Ambience is good, nice place to hangout with friends. Staffs are cordial. Coming to the foods: Polular as a chinese restaurant so better to opt for chinese dishes. A plate of rice or noodles is sufficient for two person with a normal apetite. Prices are reasonable.

Calcutta bistro is one of the hidden gem I found.

●Location●
Located at the small lane beside of Sulekha petrol pump which you'll definitely missed in first time.

●Ambiance and Deco●
When you entered in the restaurant you will be amazed because the place is huge and has seating arrangements divided between two floors.

●Food●
Went there nearly 1 and half year ago. Not much in memory but food quality was excellent and service is very good. Portion size is little bit small and price is kinda high. But all are justified.

A simple restaurant....neither the decor nor the place is exotic but food is yummy. Really delicious. A great value for money and one would like to visit it again n again. The best part is that they do not close down in the afternoon.

Cheap luxury!
Had come to this relatively unknown place on recommendation of a friend. Not to forget, the student discount drew me more. A few days left of coleg and I along with my veggie friend came here to get the benefit of the offer. 

Honestly speaking, I was awed by the interiors as compared to the exteriors. Two floors of seating, white walls, nicely done tables, well air conditioned. When you see a cost for two on zomato this low, you certainly don't expect it be this gud.

The order comprised of Veg Manchow Soup, Thai Fish, Budhha's Delight and Ginger capsicum fried rice. To start with, the soup was nice and flavourful, ample amount of noodles. Thai fish was the star, wit nice tangy flavours and 8 pcs of fish. Buddha's delight was actually a delight, a mixed veg dish in manchurian styled gravy with ample amount of mushrooms broccoli and baby corn amongst others. The fried rice, though huge in quantity, was just normal. Apart from a few juliennes of ginger, it didn't justify its name.

The service was prompt. The waiting time for food was maybe a little longer than other places I have been, but bearable. You need to notify them before ordering about the students discount. The servers were attentive to our requests.

The best part of this experience was when the bill arrived. We actually payed much less than what we had expected. All this for only 550. But then u need to be a student with a valid ID card to avail this offer. Keep up with the good work Calcutta bistro!

This place is well served and maintained with amazing pocket friendly prices for the Students. And they've special discounts for Students (upto 20%) if you can show a valid Student ID card. How's that? :D 
Ambiance is quite good with Two levels the service is reasonably good. Dishes are served very nicely, my personal favorite being Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Chicken Fried Rice with Lemon Grass Chicken. They serve Indian as well, do try Garlic Butten Naan :)

Calcutta Bistro when it came in my mind i always reach there to eat delicious food.  Nothing to describe about the food, the quality and very important quantity of the food. They provide rice in a bowl,which is almost enough for 2 persons. Chicken is not upto mark. I have visited this place 4 times. And the most important which gives a smile on a student face. ie 20 % discount of those who has valid student id card. So if you want to go to this place make your day with Kebab,Rice(mixed/schezuan/HongKong), chicken(as you wish) and dont forget to take desrt(tooti-frooti).

If I have to describe this restaurant in few words then then I would describe it as, pocket friendly, huge quantity , serves average quality food. They serve both chinese and indian .But eating here number of times I feel that there indian is little bit superior than that of their chinese. Although pan fried chilli fish is really good and they have wide range of chinese dishes . But please don't go for biriyani.

Note: My previous review got deleted automatically due to some issue so its a repost.

Date Of Visit : 18/03/2016

The Place &Location : This place is situated near Sukantasetu, just before the crossing behind a petrol pump. The entrance seems like entering someone's house through a small passage but its built in quite a big area i must say. This venue has two floors and both are for dining. The walls are decorated with nice paintings, good false ceiling lighting and few other decorative items displayed. The ambiance is nice and they maintain proper cleaniness and hygiene with soft music playing in the bacground as per mood. The waiters are nice and their way of serving is good too, but one thing that i felt irritating is one of their waiter was continuosuly looking at us while eating (Reason for giving less rating). This is something that creates panic in mind when you are enjoying your food and somebody watches you with eyes wide open. The seating arrangement is very nice and the tables are very well clean and decorated with plates,spoons and flowers. This place is a well known joint for youngsters and students. Price is reasonable and most of all they are giving special discount of 20% to students.

The Food : A sudden craving for Chinese food erupts and it made me to come here. Heard a lot about this place so decided today to try it. I tried 4 items today and they are : 1. Prawn Arabian Salt & Pepper, 2. MurgReshmiKabab, 3. Mixed Fried Rice, & 4.Schezwuan Chicken.

1. Prawn Arabian Salt &Pepper : The presentation of the dish was ok and the size of prawns were decent. It lacked softness which normally prawns do have after cooking. The spices used were tasty enough to give a good taste and the chilly flakes made it more mouth watering. As far as i am concerned, The prawns used were sponzy to eat and needed effort to chew it. Overall it could be tried as a starter if you are a prawn lover... My Rating : 3/5

2. MurgReshmiKabab : One word for this item, Fantastic!!! The outlook of the dish was giving a positive feeling and nicely presented. Have tried Reshmikabab at somany places but this place has the perfection. The taste was amazingly superb and it went far beyond my expectation. The chicken pieces were nice and soft and the Chatni given with it was a hidden gem. Its a must order dish and highly recommended from my side if you are planning to visit CB. One of the best dish at reasonable price... My Rating : 5/5

3. Mixed Fried Rice : A disappointing dish i must say. Lacks chicken & prawn pieces, made with simple ingredients and doesnt even made me feel the chinese way. The quantity and quality was good enough for two persons but whats the use of having those when there is no taste. I really felt that even small food stalls make better fried rice than this one. They need improvement in this catergory for sure.

My Rating : 2.5/5

4. SchezwuanChicken : Again a disappointment. Heard lot about this dish and decided to try it today but no satisfaction. Chicken stripes were dropped in a somehow made gravy and presented. Got no special taste of this dish with mixed fried rice and seemed like having curry with rice. Only found lot of onion inside the gravy and no spicyness or bitterness which could make any difference. Dissatisfied with the main course... My Rating : 2.5/5

Overall Experience & Recommendation : In my Overall experience for this place i am going to rate

4/5 for Ambiance

4/5 for Service

4/5 for Cleanliness & Hygiene

3.5/5 for Food (This rating just because of good starters)

Something new and innovative ideas drags the youngster to come to this place and spent quality time. I felt nearly satisfied with the starters but very disappointed with the main course. May be the quality of food was not upto the mark but more hardworkd could make it best. Its a reasonable place so the pocket pinch wont hurt you much.. My recommendation would be Murg Reshmi Kabab.

Wow, look at the ratings! And look at the photos I had attached! 
Started with the mocktail, pinacolada was good, in fact really good, so 1 star for that.

The soup was OKAY, nothing special about it!

Biriyani! The worst till date in Kolkata. It tasted somewhat like pulao.

And the last one, Balti chicken, served in a balti they thought is a cool idea, I appreciate that, but I got was a slippery curry with 4 pieces of chicken floating in that! 

Please management, look at the custard, after looking at it I had to cancel it, grainy stale looking custard it was!

After complaining the manager ensured me that I will get a better service next time, but what about NOW?

Nice ambience and good staffs and i just love this place as it is.
We ordered pan fried chicken for starters and then hong kong rice, singapore rice, kung pao chicken and hunan prawn. The side dishes needs special appreciation for its beautiful taste.
Whats more? its pocket friendly easy to locate and with the student discount event..worthy of being a student fav.

tried many of their dishes ... but  the tandoori chicken and the hot garlic paneer are my favourites ... 
the quality and quantity of food are good .. pocket friendly ... it has got clean and tidy interiors and friendly staffs... 
This place also scores for its location... If you are looking for a good restaurant in the jadavpur area then this is definitely worth visiting ..

I've been visiting this place for quite some time now but this is my first time reviewing it. The location might be just a bit tricky for the first timers. Anyway, the décor is pretty good, gives a nice & calming vibe. Special marks for hygiene and overall cleanliness. The food is great and the quantity is pretty damn good too. Caribbean drum stick, honey glazed chicken wings, kung pao chicken, lemon chicken, Hong Kong fried rice, Chinese chopsuey are some of my favourites. The only real problem that I've faced here so far is that the order takes a lifetime to arrive at your table. But overall it's a great restaurant. Cheers.

Located near the sukanta setu, though this place is quite spacious; it still remains quite full during festive seasons. Reason being the good food that is served at a reasonable price. I have tried only chinese items from here and would say everything was very good. The quantity of a single item is more than enough to serve two person.

Located just behind the Sulekha Petrol Pump. This place was on my wishlist for long and i heared many good reviews of this restaurant. I being a student got 20% discount on the total bill. I ordered Thai chicken basil fried rice and Spicy Hunan Prawn. The food tastes good. Also the quantity is worth every penny. Though the ambience is not at par, it's a little bit congested.

Visited this place last weekend.It was for a long time in the bookmarks.Firstly interiors were tidy (its not a themed restaurant) .It is located just beside the sulekha petrol stop.  Not hard to locate as they have their board outside.

We ordered chicken tandoori for starters and then plain rice and khadai chicken for the mains.The food came to our table in 15mins and it was awesome.Just one note I would like to give the the restaurant authority that if you could make the Indian main chicken dishes with bone(When asked about it the waiter said that all dishes were boneless :( . We though prefer the Indian ones with bone.PS:The tandoori chicken was with bone obviously).
Overall the food was tasty and we enjoyed every bit of it.And the extra 20% off was bliss.
We were so hungry that we forgot to take pictures.We do it in the next visit. :) .

I've visit this place uncountable number of times. From my view the Chinese section is better than Indian food here. Drumstick, Meifoon and Balti chicken can be the highlights of this place, you can also try tutty fruity ice cream here...nice place to come with both family and friends...

The cuisine is really good with the food quality being excellent. I went there with my parents to try out Chinese delicacies and we were not at all disappointed. Pan fried chilli fish and chicken drumsticks set the mood. Fried rice and hakka noodles were simply great. And so was the dry chilli chicken. The quality goes hand in hand with the quantity. The funniest thing about this place is that after you have had your food to the fullest and see the bill, you will just have a laugh because it is super duper pocket friendly. The only point I found against this place is the service. It is a bit on the slower side. Rest is something worth having rather than speaking...

Calcutta Bistro is second home for me. It's very close to my place thus I often go there or order home delivery. A decent ambience summed up with some nice dishes. I had #PanFriedMomo, #SchezwanChicken #GarlicChicken #MixedNoodles #AmericanChoupsey and #TuttiFruity ice cream. You can add this place in your regular's list as it is pocket friendly. The presentation of the dishes are appealing and you won't be able to resist as soon as you get the plate on your table. 

P.S :- Do try the ice creams (Desserts) out here...

I have been to this place many time.the stuffs are nice,every thing is pretty clean. My favourite starter is the carribian drumsticks, it's yummy.the Singapore fried rice,egg rapped rice,Hong Kong rice are good,the chicken items are better than the fish ones,in Indian section the biriyani and  masala kulcha are very good,biriyani is a bit different than the others,but I liked it,didn't like the polao much,but the kadai chicken is my favourite. Desserts are nice also and important thing is it goes easy in your pocket. Over all It's a nice place near home.

Another place, walking distance from my college. So we tend to eat here once in a while. Its located behind the petrol pump at Sulekha More, Jadavpur. Its pocket friendly and you get  both Indian and Chinese food. I love the pan fried dishes specially the Pan fried fish. The fried rice and chowmeins are okay. The hong kong chowmein is a little spicy.

Now coming to the food... I would not say it was very good and would not even call it too bad... We ordered quite a few things and of course Chinese is what we all wanted...
I would say it was a so-so experience and Calcutta Bistro is not one which finds a very good rating in my list. :):):)

Well opinions may differ but i didn't like this place. Went there for the 1st time a couple of weeks back along with my 12 friends. For starters we had drumstick pan fried fish ( the best part of the whole evening) and pepper chicken. In the main course we had Mixed pan fried gravy noodles, mixed fried rice, kung pao, chicken manchurian, chicken three alarm fire cracker chicken and hunan chicken. Well the pan fried noodles was awful and i had to struggle with it all the way through. Moreover the AC wasn't working.The side dishes were decent but nothing extraordinary. The service was satisfactory. Overall it wasn't a very pleasant experience for me.

I have heard of Calcutta Bistro from many of my friends,but never got a chance to visit. Today we ordered for home delivery through Zomato here. And their service was pretty good. :) We ordered two mixed fried rice and kadai chicken. The rice item was so light and full of vegetables, paneer with less amount of any oil or spices mixed up. The chicken was tender,well cooked and fresh..and the gravy was so delicious that we finished every trace from the container.. :D really I am in love of their food,the combination of kadai chicken and mixed fried rice made our day really. :D

Sharing another experience of today too..we had drum sticks,kulcha..murg hariyqli kabab.. All the dishes were good. But I just loved the drum stickcs,they were so perfectly cooked and tasted very yummy..there is also a 20% discount going on now,so go visit this place...

When In Kolkata, the food is cheaper. Atleast for people that live in any other metropolitan city. This place is a decent visit. Been there a couple of times with friends and family. Ordered delivery as well. They're pretty good in terms of food. Service and decor are moderately okay. Always prebook, I've had to wait in queue a few times to get a table. Recommendations include anything Chinese. Special mention would be lung fung soup and egg wrapped fried rice.

This one is a very special one. I forgot the number of times i visited this restro. This time it was for my parents' anniversary. We orderd pan fried chicken and fish mofatte in starters. The fish preapration was much better than the chicken one.  For mocktails we had humpty dumpty and my mother's favourite blue sky.
For the main course there were chicken fried rice and kung pao chicken and finally coming to desserts i had my all time favourite tutty fruity whereas my dad went for arabian delights. Overall it's another great outing after a long time.

I have been coming to a place just opposite to this for quite some time now and always wanted to visit this restaurant since then. Having heard so many good reviews, this was definitely in one of my bucket lists. So, one fine evening, I decided to drop by. Locating this place can be a bit difficult as it is not visible from the main road. This is rather situated behind the Sulekha Petrol Pump, so one needs to take the small line to the right of the petrol pump (lane towards 8B side) to reach the restaurant.

The restaurant is probably divided into two floors. I decided to settle at the ground floor. The staff however seemed very reluctant, but I was too tired to make a fancy venture upstairs. Ordered for a Masala Cold Drinks, Crispy Chicken, Tutty Fruity for dine-in and a Lollypop for take-away. First to come was the Masala Cold Drinks. Smeared in 1 kg of Masala, the person preparing this one probably didn't seem concerned about the excessive Masala he had put in. The Crispy Chicken was to come next. Although crispy in nature, the presence of the chef's special sauce, as it was supposedly to come with, was nowhere to be found. Only accompaniment was the Tomato Ketchup. The last one to come was the Tutty Fruity. Prepared fancily, with good quality ice creams and topped with just the right amount of sauce, the disappointment lied in here too. The quantity of apple was way too more than I would have had liked, and there was no balance between the number of banana slices present to the number of mini apple slices. 

For the take-away, I found the lollipop decent but the batter was way too thick. If not for the 20% student concession, I don't think this place has any other USP's to boast about. There are a number of places which serves better Chinese food at a similar price tag and I definitely do not fancy myself paying another visit here.

Yesterday was my second visit to Calcutta Bistro on account of a friend's job treat.. For starters we had pepper chicken, pan fried chilli chicken, pan fried chilli fish and chicken drumsticks.. I found the pepper chicken to be little dry but taste wise everything was good.. Coming to the main course, there was a difference in opinion among people about the pan fried noodles. some who compared it with other restaurant's pan fried noodles didn't quite like it... but for me it was just fine.. The other dishes were okay but I particularly liked the Manchurian chicken dry and Hunan chicken.. the wine flavour in the Hunan chicken was coming right through.. Overall the food was good and the service was kinda okay..

Well, first the actual place of this restutrant a bit hard to find. This is actually just behind the petrol pump at Sulekha, Jadavpur. 

It is a very good well designed and two floored resturant. Ambience is good.

Me and my two friends went there yasterday for a dinner. We ordered the Hariali Kabab for the starter and a Chicken Fried rice , a Hong Kong Fried rice and Thai Chicken for the main menu. The serve within 15 minutes the quality is cery good. Hong Kong Chicken is very spicy and well cooked. Thai Chicken is semi gravy and very tasty. 
Allover this is a very good experience there and will go there again for sure next time .

This place was bookmarked in my list for quite sometime and finally had a chance to visit them.

USP: Decent pricing is the main USP of this place and has been among the students favorite as they offer discounts for them upon showing your student ID card.

Location: It's just beside the sulekha junction petrol pump

Decor and Ambiance:
It's a good family restaurant divided in two floors. Mid sized to be precised with simple decorations around.

Food:

1. Orange blossom - a little too tangy..not too bad.
2. Soda good.. like the usual
Honey glazed wings was good
3. Mixed gravy noodles- a bit bland..
But gravy chow had adequate amount of prawns, chicken and egg as it was supposed to be that was a plus.

4.Cashew nut chicken was ok..bt shredded chicken pieces were too small and not enough.

Service: I was quite satisfied with the kind of courtesy and helpfulness they offer to their customers. Well done.. Keep it up...

I was expecting a bit too much from this place which they just managed to suffice although can be done a little better.

A place located behind Sulekha Petrol Pump, hidden by a mango tree, this might be a bit difficult to locate. But once you find it, you are going to turn up here quite a few times with friends because they provide a 20% student discount when you produce your student ID to them. 
Well, yesterday we had been there as usual for a late lunch. The restaurant is two-floored. The ground floor was empty when we got in. They asked us to go to the first floor. A few families were dining, two or three couples too. By the time we settled in, they all had left. So we were the only one to enjoy alone. It was too late to have lunch, so we went for starters only.
We had ordered the Chicken Meatball Soup, Fish Moffato, Butter Prawn and Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The soup was pretty good, had a very different flavours, the bowl filled with succulent meat balls. The babycorn was typical too but really tasty - it was crispy, tossed in the sauce very well and had a perfect balance of spring onions, chopped onions and the babycorn itself. Next came the prawns. It said to be a popular Malaysian delicacy and also had mentioned of some Indian connection. Don't know about the Malaysian connection, rather the curry leaves, the coconut essence all left us of thinking this to be a Keralite dish. But it was good - in quantity and quality both. Last came the Fish Moffato. We had great expectations from it. But this was kinda okayish. At last, we had ordered a Virgin Pinnacolada and a Fruit Punch mocktail to end the meal. Both of them were delicious, a bit on the higher side of pricing. The meal was good. Thanks to the students' discount policy, it made the bill much less than we thought it to be. Ambience was good and all. I am surely gonna come back soon with my friends for a treat or so. Happy Dining! :)

Situated at Sulekha just behind the Petrol Pump at the crossing, this place offers great food at a very reasonable price. Though a cluster of food ventures have come up in and around this place, few really offers food of such delicious and  sumptuous proportions. Seating is also very comfortable with well cushioned sofas being provided at most of the tables. The most welcome thing about this restaurant is however, the 20% flat discount which the restaurant offers to all students on the basis of their valid ID cards. Overall, a wonderful place offering sumptuous and extremely tasty food at a very reasonable price, which has been made even more reasonable courtesy the discount offers for all students. Thus, a highly recommended place which should be on everyone's priority list.

I have been to this place a couple of times, and I have pleasant memories to account for from both instances. The place is clean, the costs are low, the menu is moderately versatile all things considered (if their tandoori items are available of course), the service is decent and the food is pretty good.

There isn't much more that I can add because there isn't much more TO add. This is a standard decent restaurant selling indian and chinese dishes. Perhaps the tiny 'balti' where they gave the balti chicken will amuse you. There's nothing remarkable about the place, which perhaps is a double edged sword. Other than that it's a very decent restaurant which feels like it can't really do wrong on any count.

The reason why I give it a  staggering 4.5 is I went there way back in 2011 during my college life with two friends and one stranger and at in those times I hardly visited any restaurants because of my financial crisis. So I am feeling so nostalgic to write this review after 4 and a half years!!!
To start off it was my 1st visit to The place called Jadavpur which I currently don't like because of some circumstances.
It was located opposite to a petrol pump and we 4 (or I should rather say we Three) entered.
I was very happy with the food quality quantity and the interior.
You can say that I liked it so much because I hardly visited any 'Accha Wala' restaurants at that time. Aminia and Hot Kathi roll was perhaps the two rebounded places I've been. I don't know about Zeeshan and don't quite remember any other. All was local 'Choto Khato' hotels!!!!!

I was amazed with one fish item and I was not expecting it to remember but while writing this review I remember the item name, it's was FISH BANZARA!!
ONE OF THE BEST I HAD. I am Kean to visit this one again and get lost in Nostalgia and #CollegeDays

Now these kind of places were very common in Kolkata when themed restaurants were yet to get into the city. Here you'll get a bit of everything. Chinese, continental, Indian and mughlai -  all in a single menu. For an on the go dinner with your family or friends which will be a bit pocket friendly, this is the place you need to be in. The service, decorations and quality us up to the mark.

One the best family restaurant I have ever seen! Really good quality of food. Quantity of one dish is like sharable with 3 people who are not so very foodie! Waiters are really humble and good at serving.

Though the board says 'amily restaurant', u can be assured that it's a family restaurant only :P
Interior is nice, though not outstanding. It took some time for the orders to be served, but the foods were worth the wait. I ordered Bistro special meifoon and Shaoxiang chicken with cashew nut and chillis. The quantity was way more than what I could consume alone, so had to get them parcelled. The foods tasted really@ good. The rice noodle was outstanding. Chinese foods appeared to be really good in this joint. Probably the best served in the locality of Jadavpur. Will definitely recommend others to come here..

A brilliant place for a pocket friendly meal to fill your stomach with. 

The location is not really hard to find, the ambiance is lovely once you've gotten inside. Seating however is a problem, so highly recommend going early to get a seat. The staff are fair and as such alright. 

Their selection of food is really good, I've been there multiple times with friends and the place has never been disappointing. 

Their quantity is really good and their home delivery is prompt and quick. 

Quality of food is good, definitely worth checking out.

This restaurant has the same owners as my childhood favorite CIT Café.. So it did not surprise me when I found the food to be exquisite.It is traditional Indian Chinese. We took Tom Yum soup, a traditional Thai soup which is quite spicy, Singapore Rice and Schezwan Chicken along with Prawn Trestina as a starter..I liked the quantity.Add to it they give 20% discount to students if you have their card.

This is one of the best eateries in the area! Pretty popular among people. Neat interior. Cordial staffs. Delicious food. The mainstream dishes such as friend rice, chilli chicken, pulao etc are all standard. Apart from those, I found the Badshahi kaju chicken, Shahi biryani and the Almond chicken in lemon honey sauce to be exceptionally good. The cocktails here are very popular!  A good, pocket friendly restro , typically ideal for those who frequently eat out!

Went here in a LARGE group after a successful show (I am into theatre) for the 'Director's Dinner'.
Tasted almost each and every item that my fellow actors ordered and was blown away by most of them.
Personally, me and the friend sitting right beside me decided to split a 'pad thai noodle' and a 'ginger pineapple fish'. Loved both the items. The pineapple fish was quite sweet, but I liked it. The noodles were full of chicken,shrimps, eggs etc.
The other items I tasted were- thai chicken soup,kung pao chicken, Mongolian fried rice, Hunan fish, Hakka chowmien , chicken in black bean sauce, American Chopsuey etc. All were considerably different in taste and quite nice.
But the icing on the cake were the desserts...
I ordered my all-time favourite dessert- caramel custard and it was perfection on a plate. The light, fluffy, souffle-ish custard was drowned in caramel which had an alcoholic aroma to it.
Someone ordered the Arabian Delight which was basically three scoops of different flavoured ice-creams (vanilla, chocolate and strawberry) drizzled with honey and served with pitted and honey-soaked dates. It came together perectly.

Suzanne, our British co-actor ABSOLUTELY LOVED her first tryst with Chinese food that was not bland.




2nd visit- Went here for lunch again, today. We were a group of 4 and we ordered a ginger and basil fried rice, mixed hakka chowmein, Hunan fish (fish steaks in a gravy of rice wine and chilli) and a superb veg dish called Buddha's Delight (which is a white gravy based dish with diced carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, shiitake mushroom, oyster mushroom, baby corn, cabbage and sweetened fried cottage cheese cubes)
Each and every dish satisfied not only the tummy but the SOUL...

We rounded the whole meal off with the tried and tested caramel custard which was heavenly perfection as always...
I had given this place a 4.5 in my last review but today's meal compelled me to increase it to a full 5.

I went there last week with my friend. First of all we received a warm welcome from the staff. They were very co-operative and well-behaved. The ambience was pleasant. We had pepper chicken which was quite good. A special mention should be made of the quantity of food they give. By sharing also we couldn't finish a bowl of rice. Side dishes were pretty good. Altogether a nice place.

After what has happened to me on my last visit I am bound to rewrite my review. Previously I had rated this place 4.5 and now I give it a 1 (wish to give a negative score) . A restaurant with fraudulent staff!!! I had been given a bill of rs 1513 rs on my last visit. I had given 3 five hundred rs notes , one ten rs note and 3 rs in coin. I had repeatedly counted the money. The waiter had somehow misplaced one of the 500 rs notes or maybe even stolen one of them and I was told that I had paid only 1013. I had to pay extra 500 rs for no fault of mine. NEVER EVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE

The Calcutta Bistro offers good food at very reasonable prices.. The thai soup and chicken clear soup, both were very good.. The malai kebab was extremely soft, juicy and tasty.. Fried momo was very tasty.. The wantons i felt had too much flour bt taste was good.. The crispy chicken was however not as crispy as we had expected it to be!!! All in all a very good experience... Staff was very attentive...Prompt service.

I went there with my friends. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn nd drums of heaven as starters. They were good. In the main course we tried north indian food such as masala kulcha, masala nun, chicken varta, raita and kaju chicken. Till now the food tastes good. I ll give 4 out of 5. Then we thought of ordering some chinese dishes. We ordered hongkong rice and pan fried chicken. They were not up to the mark. I ll give 2 out of 5. So if you r thinking of visiting this place thn I ll suggest you to try only north indian dishes. I forgot to tell 1 thing. They took long time to serve our dishes though we were the only group present there.

hongkong rice was the best part out of all which i had order for....moreover the garnishing of the food items were so good that on seeing the items u might feel that ur tummy is already half filled ...... lol...
Yeah saying about quantity its more than enough and about quality i wud say it was a delight to eat.... waiters were polite with their customers.... waiting till my next visit.... this time i would lyk to explore the indian section.... .....


_______________________________________________________
   

So this is about my second visit to this place .... in two word this place is  "absolute love " .... chicken drumstick turned out to be the best out of all that we had ordered  for  ....  as usual like the last visit to this place again i had taken hongkong rice and as a side dish i went for chicken  in oyester sauce  .... well all the  food satisfied my buds ... and last but not the least the crispy chicken could have been better .....
Served well... :) :)  :)

One of the popular student friendly restaurants in jadavpur area. Tried chicken in black pepper sauce, balti prawn, masala kulcha and a mocktail. The ambience is quite good, and the service is fast. The food could have been better. One can try the hunan chicken here. The balti prawn was not up to the mark and the chicken in pepper sauce tasted sour. Expected a lot better. Overall, 3/5.

Calcutta bistro is one of the best dining option in Jadavpur at pocket friendly prices. Interior is above average. Though it is a multi cuisine restaurant, it mainly specializes in indian food. However, crispy chilli baby corn is one of their signature dishes. Starting from biryani, naan kulcha and Indian curry, all are quite good. Their Chinese preparations are okayish. Pricing is on the lower side.

It's a great place for students hangout in Jadavpur area.Located in Sulekha more,this restaurant serves decent foods in fair range. Visited this place just last day with my friend. We ordered Chilli garlic noodles (veg and nonveg).Noodles are delicious and divine.Thai Fish is amazingly tasty and mouthwatering. There are various items for prwan lovers also.We tried Mandarin prwan, it's tantalising, amazing tasty. In desert, Caramel custard is wonderful in taste, you just can't miss it.
Ambience is good except lighting. Staffs are well mannered. Bonus is that if you have students id card,you will get 20% discount on total bill.Overall it's a pleasant experience.

Its located exactly behind the sulekha petrol pump-a narrow lane at its right will lead you to it. Tandoori chicken,Caribbean drumsticks , chicken tika butter masala, mixed fried rice and tutti frutti ice cream are my personal favourites from this place!Though kung pao chicken is famous here-yet i would say i have tasted better kung pao!food served is great!Must try for everyone especially if you are a student!

Probably one of the best in jadavpur area and the price is really reasonable and they also serve a varied fare. Went there for a birthday treat and the first thing that left a mark was the pan fried chilli fish. It somehow has become one of my favorite starters nowadays. We had Singapore and Hong Kong rice. Both were really good and we were pretty apprehensive about the fact that most places ruin them,but they thankfully didn't. Do give it a try,its worth it.

The noodles tasted awesome nd went well with the semi spicy chicken side dish.  The quantity was another positive. One plate noodles would suffice three. The onus was 20% student discount

One bus stop distance from Jadavpur University and near Sulekha more , The Calcutta Bistro is one of best in South Town ... And As a student of JU it's the nearest restaurant where I can visit now and then... I have visited Bistro a plenty of times and guess what ! The taste never gets old...
I have tried several dishes here ... among them Chicken and Mutton Shahi Biriyani are good ... Among fried rice Mixed , Sechezwan, Singapore, Hongkong , Monogolian all are delicious but not so different from each other ... it's just some are too spicy and some are less ... Reshmi kebab tastes good in mouth ... But the most scrumptious dishes I had was non veg curries ... I have tried balti prawn, balti chicken , Kadhai chicken, Reshmi chicken butter masala , Mutton roghan josh , Mutton Keema ...
Every dish has its own taste and is price worthy ...
The best part was the serving of the foods ...like balti prawn is given in a small balti or kadhai chicken is given in small kadhai...
The decor was also good and space is also sufficient as it has two floors of seating arrangements...
#Best for giving treats...

It's one of the best restaurants in jadavpur. Yeah I can safely say that considering food and the price point. I've been there twice. And at both the times I fell for the food and for their cosy ambience as well. 1st time I asked them for 'house special' - they recommended mongolian chicken wd mixed rice. And for starter we took drumstick nd tandoori. U may find this combination a little weird tho :). But I enjoyed every bit of the food. My girlfriend and I visited again a few days back this month. Ordered mixd rice, thai chicken nd desserts. Thai chicken was delicious. Not so spicy, rather a perfect combination of sweetish, sourish and tingling to your tastebuds :).

And above all what makes me love Bistro so much-the affordable price of food. It wouldn't burn your pocket yet you'll be satiated.

Location: Near sulekha. Nearest bus stop: K8
It'll be on your ri8 when you head towards garia station/garia bazar from jadavpur p.s

In one word my first time experience with this place is awesome. I went there today for new year special lunch with my best friend. Firstly, the ambiance and simple decor of the dining place was decent. Secondly, the staffs were well mannered. Thirdly and most importantly the taste as well as the quantity of the food served was great. We have ordered Pepper chicken in starter, Kung pao chicken & Chicken chilli garlic noodles in main course and Caramel custard in dessert. Each and every item was perfectly tasty, yummy and delicious. I liked the pepper chicken the most and also the caramel custard was pretty good. Very much satisfied and happy with my selection of this place for new year lunch. :-)

One of the best restaurants I've ever dined in. Reasonable prices, sumptuous delicacies, cordial waiters, hygienic conditions. Plus the dessert Arabian Delight was the topping on the cake. A must go dine- in.

We had a lovely experience at this place today. This place has two floors, and the upper one is separated from the bottom by a staircase lit up by halogen lights, really pretty. The ambiance was decent and the service was really good. Polite and courteous waiters. The quantity of the dishes served were more than sufficient, could not have asked for more. Nothing overpriced, everything was just about right.

I accidentally bumped into this one this afternoon. And much to my surprise, it turned out to be a pleasant experience. 

Let's start with their service. It was quite decent. The waiters are well aware about what they serve. 

Coming to the food. We were just 2 people. Had ordered Pan Fried Chilli Fish in the starters which was amazing. A Must Try I would say. Then we moved on to Egg Hakka Noodles along with Kung Pao Chicken. The quantity was enough to sustain 3 people in a single plate of noodles. The chicken, though a nice preparation, contained nuts which I personally do not prefer in Chinese and hence was a bit disappointing. 

Coming to the pricing. It was decently priced. Not too heavy on the pockets. 

Worth a try!

One lane leads to another and you end up in this joint. No parking area. Very noisy surroundings. Cheap interiors. Horribly dirty washroom. Food is fairly priced. Too spicy. Waiters do not care. Too many staff clutters the atmosphere. Maybe one time go is ok. Table cloths are dirty. Water jugs are stained.

Calcutta Bistro the name seems to be very old but well popular in its locality that I got to know from my friends living there. It was a birthday treat from my side & the final experience was very satisfying.

Location : Near to the Jadavpur Station just beside the petrol pump on Sakuntala Road you need to notice the board of Calcutta Bistro & follow the lane till you reach the entrance. Although the restaurant is inside of the small lane still the roadside board makes it easy to locate.

Decorations : With 2 floors of full siting this restaurant is pretty huge to handle many groups at once. Simple elegant looks are the impression of first sight & small decorative items & photo frames does catch eyes. Warm white lightings makes the ambience more pleasant. A single table can handle 6 people at once & sitings are comfortable too. Even the table was well decorated with plate & glass mats & flower holder with rose. Old Bollywood music playing in the background at very low volume makes this place romantic too.

Staffs & Management : Staffs were very friendly & well behaved from guiding us to choose the best dish to serving. But they took a bit long to serve the order on table.

Foods : I was following the Zomato users guidelines for our order & we ordered the following...

Tandoori Chicken : This is one of the item the restaurant is known for. There was 4 pieces in a full plate served with salad, lemon & green leaf sauce. The chicken pieces were equally soft in every corner & perfectly baked. Lite spices were used so that the real taste of chicken can be felt well. At the same time the chicken pieces felt juicy from inside. It was carrying an authentic taste unlike other restaurants, so that this place is known for it. Simply this was one of the best Tandoori Chicken I had tasted.

Chilli Garlic Noodles : The bowl of Chilli Garlic Noodles was very eye catching with its rich looks. It is also one of the famous items of this restaurant. The rich garlic smell impressed me in a fraction of second. The noodles were of thin quality that I really liked & it was mixed well with rich spices. Less vegetables were used to overflow the taste of chilli, garlic & spices. It was fried very well with perfect amount of oil used & little crispy that felt very good. The quantity of the dish was pretty good to feed 2 people easily. It itself feels so good that you would like to have it without any side dishes. This dish tasted so good to me so it changes the definition of noodles to me.

Chicken Fried Rice : Just like the noodles the rice bowl also carried a large quantity. Apart from the quantity the rice quality was very good & cooked very well. It was little bit oily but very lite on taste. Less vegetables were used but they were well diced & mixed. It doesn't carried any special spices & it tasted very average to me.

Kung Pao Chicken : With lots of rich dry fruits like pie nuts, It was such a wonderful dish that you can't get everywhere. There were 8 very small chicken pieces but well mixed with the rich gravy & taste was coming from inside. The taste of this dish was very unique & hard to explain. It was kind of sweet & chilli type. Sweet dry foods adds a new flavour to the chicken where its richness felt really good into the mouth. It was with lots of vegetables & spicy at the same time. It tasted very good with the noodles. Doesn't matter if you like the chilli dishes more still you will love to have this.

Hunan Chicken : Chicken Sliced Pieces were dipped into the white sauce with lots of green, yellow & red capsicums. There was 8 pieces of chicken, marinated well with white gravy. Chicken pieces were very soft well cooked & tasted very lite spicy. This dish tasted very good & it was perfect with fried rice.

Pricing : For all those mentioned dishes fulfilled 7 people very well & the bill was Rs. 1910. The pricing was expected & common with same kind of restaurants.

Conclusion : Some of the dishes of this restaurant is famous for is a must try & fully recommend for any kind of foodies. Nice environment & good foods is enough to blow your mind to visit this place second time.

If you are looking for quality and quantity near the Jadavpur area, Calcutta Bistro should be trusted blindly. I've seriously lost count how many times I've been to this joint. And this place has amazingly remained consistent as usual. 

I try something new every time I'm here (barring the Caramel Custard which is compulsory on every visit). And they never fail to surprise me. Truly, it's a great place for college goers who can go with great food at affordable rates.

This time, I went for Spicy stir-fried chicken with cashew nuts, Thai chicken basil fried rice, General Tso's chicken and my favorite dessert here (obviously). Everything was cooked to perfection, tasted great with big portions. And as usual, the custard bowled me over.

Heaps of praises apart, this restaurant can really do with some remodeling. Most of the menu cards are torn and tattered, you get to see big cracks on the walls, and so on… things which shouldn't happen with such a great joint. So I'm hoping to see some positive changes made to this place pretty soon.

A regular family restaurant. Food is descent and their prices are very reasonable. Small lunch can be planned here. The staffs are good and most of the time the place remains moderately crowded so no reservation needed. The white and red ambiance is good enough to create a good impression. Worth trying a few of their mock tails.

Everything was awesome, chicken pieces were tender and flavourful. Would licked thicker noodles, but that's okay. Price is justified. This place is a classic restaurant in jadavpur area.

Visited this restaurant for dinner on 18th November,2015 with my brother.This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant,the first experience was not that good thats why I didn't write any review.But this time I was really impressed by their service and food quality so this review.Being a wednesday night,the place was not much crowded so got a table immediately.The most common complain I hear about this restro is their service and reception but to my surprise both these factors were found wrong.While eating one of the waiters kept asking repeatedly about how the food was and also served the food with lot of care each and every time.We ordered a plate of caribbean drumsticks,mixed chilli garlic noodles and prawn in oyster sauce.The waiter even suggested the prawn dish to be taken with chilly garlic noodles.He advised me to take something light since chilly garlic noodles was a spicy dish,he advised me to take prawn in oyster sauce and I agreed to it and was not dissapointed.All the items were served hot and fresh and were lip smacking.Both times I tried chinese,will definitely try their kebabs and Indian dishes next time.

Last saturdaý it was the day  of kali maa bhisarjan..and we decided to visit calcutta bistro.it was our post diwali celebration.the restaurent is behind a petrol pump near sukanto setu.we decided to go upstairs and  found the right place to make ourselves comfortable..we  first ordered carebean drumsticks..they served it very quickly.it had six drumsticks.all were deeply fried and tossed in red sauce.yummy it was..next we ordered tandoori chicken.the chicken were well cooked yet very tender and juicy..we enjoyed it.afterwards for main course we ordered kung fao chicken and egg wrapped rice..when the food came   I was very excited  seeing the egg wrapped rice..the fried rice was fully covered with a egg omlette and the waiter served it with expertise.the rice was very tasty.though i didnt like the kung fao chicken as it had a smoky flavour..the food was overall good.price was very reasonable.. wish to visit there next tym and taste their caramel custard and butter noodles..all i have to say its a place worth visiting.. thank you calcutta bistro. 😊

So here is the deal with this restaurant, the chef here is decent (okay..ish) but the management is just horrible.. And i mean HORRIBLE. 

If there is waiting, the guard will not even answer how much approximate time it will take. (Minimum expectation?). He would rather shove u away.

You order food at 8:00 PM, they will say it will reach at 9:00. Call them at 9:15 and they will LIE ( i want to bold the word LIE here) and say its on the way (home is 2 min drive away). It will however reach at 10:30 PM (after you resort to begging)

We went there last night. Actually all other restro were closed that's why we had no other options left. The food quality was good but the price of salad and cold drinks was too high.. 1 plate small normal salad was 60 rs + tax.. And 1 glass of pepsi was 40 rs + tax.. They told us that contains 300 ml of pepsi but we really have doubt about its quantity..

I expected a lot more from here when i saw its overall rating (3.9)! I had been here for a birthday treat and had both the cuisines available here. North Indian dishes tasted better than Chinese.
As starters, we took pan fried chicken(8pieces) and crispy chilli baby corn. Pan fried chicken here didnot satisfy me.
In North Indian, we took butter nan & reshmi chicken butter masala. Both complemented each other very well.
In Chinese, we had veg fried rice, schezwan chicken fried rice & kung pao chicken (8pieces). The rice was good but something was missing from the chicken dish..i felt!
And lastly we finished our lunch with a sweet tooth i.e dessert. In dessert, chocolate sundae was awesome!!
Otherwise the service was fast & good & very cheap. :)

Although its hidden behind a petrol pump, its fame & glory is barely hidden. My friend invited me there for her birthday treat. We ordered Drumstick Chicken and Pan Fried chilly fish for starters. The drums were very tasty and also the pan fried fish.
Then came Singapore Fried Rice, Hakka Chowmein, Kung Pao chicken and Crispy Fish in Coriander Lemon sauce. The star of the show was Crispy Fish, everyone must try it cause this is one dish I'll never forget. The other main course meals were also great specially Singapore Rice.
Must visit again. :)

This place is almost always crowded and sometimes getting a table is hard. And their popularity is very much understandable once you order the food. Their ambiance, decor and service is not much to write home about. But what they do best is provide humongous quantities of good food at very low prices. This is the place to be if you are very hungry and very low on cash. And they shall provide you a very high amount of unusually high quality food. Word of caution: Due to the large portion sizes and low prices first timers generally tend to over order a lot. No longer a problem for me as I am a regular, mostly because i regularly run low on money and eat a lot.

I have visited Calcutta Bistro a number of times, it being located near my house. Coming to the dishes, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Schezwan Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Kung Pao Prawns, Reshmi Kabab, Tikka Kabab, etc are some of the dishes that i have tried. The standouts are the chilli garlic chicken and the kung pao chicken. The rest of the dishes are good enough. They don't use a lot of oil in their food which is a bonus. Great for treating friends on birthdays!! Ting! :-)

This place is immensely pocket friendly and the quality and quantity of food they serve is really great. If you have low budget and want give treat to your friends then try this restaurant ... It will satisfy you and your reputation too. Chinese and tandoor both are great lip smacking here.

I had a chance to visit this place during durga puja. All the dishes were delicious. No complains about the food. Great services by all the boys. But i was disappointed by one thing - during durga puja they reduced their quantity of food... I wont say that this place is the best place to dine out but for a change one can try this place...

It's a very good place to have the lunch or dinner. I went there with my friends during puja after looking most the reviews. But unfortunately I am sorry to say that the food quality isn't up to the mark. The stuffs are not friendly. It might because of the puja the extra pressure. So I gave 3 out of 5..

Visited the place many times,specially for the location and its price make the place ideal for hanging out with friends.let's come to main point..food.I have tried many of the dishes...I think the Indian menu is good.bt whenever we go we surely ordered caribbean drum sticks in the starter...the delicious one.
As a main courses,hunan chicken was one of my favourite.recently I have tried the crispy fish with lemon coriander sauce...which you can try in starter as well as in main.The dish was truely delicious :)
But I dnt like the bistro special mei fun(rice noodles) which was suggested by them.It was so light and simple dish....there is no special about it...we have to put sauce on it to make it tasty.

Heard some great feedback from my colleague about CB. So while returning from workplace decided to take a detour and check this place out. During my college days in JU we used to visit banjara or beduin. This place seemed like new hit with college crowd. We ordered soup, pan fried fish and another starter chicken with cashews. Service was prompt. Food quality and quantity was also apt. I like the college buzz about this place. Surely I will be back to this place to check out other dishes.

Located behind sulekha petrol pump this restaurant is popular , always busy and crowded owing to its reasonable pricing and quality of food. On a regular weekend , you have to wait atleast 30 mins usually for a dinner spot. Food quality is good and price is very reasonable. Must try chicken biriyani, chicken drumsticks,it has a different taste over here.

We ordered lung fung soup carribean drumsticks, pepper chicken, pan fried chilli fish, murg reshmi kebab, egg wrapped fried rice, hong kong fried rice, balti chicken, kung pao chicken. The starters were really good in taste. But the main course was a bit on the down side. But overall we were quite satisfied with the taste and quantity of food and service.

They've recently added tax, but still they are one of the most reasonable and amazing restaurants here in South Kolkata, jadavpur area.  I've tried both Indian and Chinese food.  Must try - hot garlic noodles, Kung pao chicken, stir fried fish in lemon coriander sauce, chicken sweet and sour, pan fried noodles.

Very close to Banzara in terms of value for money. Only been here twice or thrice but the quantity and quality of food has impressed me on both occasions. Regular Chinese and North Indian food doing pretty well. Some of their main courses can be sweeter than you want them to be. But please try the Murgh Lasuni Tikka, fantastic. A very good place if you need to treat a number of friends but you are on a tight budget.

I have been visiting this place since last two years. Design of the MENU card is still same. :p
Today I visited this place for lunch. Bit crowded and have to wait for sometime for my turn. I have ordered the Bistor Special maifun rice noodles and Thai Prawn. The quantity was enough for two persons and the taste were too good. Finally ordered ordered cold coffee with ice-cream. I will say this is 1000 times better than the cold coffee at CCD. Another desert was Arbial Delight (Three Scoop of ice cream + dates+ honey and 3 cherry on the top). This was more than awesome. I will say each of the desert, you must try. Tutifruti, cream caramel custard.......

Each of the cousin, I have tried there till date was just fantastic.

I could not control myself to take a photo of food.. :p

Have eaten here for probably 30 times now. Reasonable price with good amount and taste defines them correctly. Good environment though the service is on the slower side a bit. But that's fine once you get fresh and just cooked dishes :) Quite a huge amount they provide i must say. It's great for students too. My personal favorites that i would always order are: Chicken Caribbean drumsticks, Prawn in oyster sauce (must try!) and lemon honey chicken.. Overall it's a great family restaurant..

i have been there once for my friend's birthday treat.we ordered caribbean chicken drumsticks in starter.Actually we wanted to have honey grizzled chicken but they could not provide that.So they suggested us to try this.And this was real good.In main course we had mixed fried rice and mongolian chicken.The quantity they served that is pretty impressive.

POCKET PINCH: 800 for four persons.
Ambiance and Decoration:Its very cozy i must say.Dimly lit ambiance and soft music made the atmosphere very gentle and soothing.
FOOD:consider the budget and you will find the food lip smacking :)
jokes apart food was fine.
P.s:your birthday is coming and you have to give treat to a biggg gang.Soo Bistro is the best to save your a**.

I went to this place a number of times, but today we got our food delivered. It took about 45 minutes. Today we ordered, 
Chicken Fried Wanton, Pan Fried Chilly Fish, Mutton Biriyani, Egg Wrapped Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken and Mongolian Chicken.
 The quantity was huge. it was hot. And every single dish was lip smacking. Tried Wantons after a long time and I loved them. Pan Fried Fish does not need any introduction. It is always good. I love their Egg Wrapped Fried Rice, it's worth mentioning. I tried the Mongolian Chicken for the first time today, it's been added to my favourites. I might sound repetitive here, but I'm telling the truth. Lastly I want to say that the Biriyani was good too. It had two mutton pieces, and the taste was nice.(I am not a fan of Biriyani, still it satisfied my taste buds.)
All these items cost around 1200 which is cheap considering the portions and taste. I will definitely visit this place again.

This quaint restaurant is the better alternative for Bawarchi in Jadavpur area. Located at a short distance from 8B towards Sulekha. The price range is medium and similar to that of Bawarchi. Its a favorite among students for the comfy ambience and the taste and quantity of food.

I have visited this joint quite a few times. They make a mean Tandoori Chic. The Crispy Chic is unique in taste and is a specialty.The Chinese they serve is pretty decent as well.

Today I ordered Tandoori Chic along with Butter Nan and Parsi Mutton Curry & fresh lime soda.
The nan was soft,crispy and buttery. What really impressed me was the aromatic flavor in the Parsi Curry. It has curry leaves in it and has its lingering flavor well balanced with 3 tender & soft mutton pieces. Its definitely recommended if you are looking for something different than routine dishes.

Had Chocolate Sundae for desert. It had too much fruit topping. The ice cream and the fruits were separate in their existence. When first served i had a tough time finding the chocolate beneath. It was a bit turndown. Simple ice cream would have been better.

The initial service was also a bit slow. They took 20 minutes to serve the Tandoori Chic. The rest was fine.

Will keep visiting.

Located at jadavpur . This restaurant is spacious, having dim lights ,comfortable seating arrangements and a moderate ambience . We ordered a fried chicken momo for the starter. Kung pao chicken and singapore noodles . 1st and foremost they served you 5pcs of momo for rs 170. Momo was good .but it was overpriced. Nextcomes kung pao chicken . Too much of soya sauce . Tasted bad n chicken pcs are too small . I mean really small. And they served noodles with an omlette at the top of it . The noodles also tasted bland
not worth a penny . Though the quantity is more than enough for 3 people. So we had to pack the left over food for parcel .

A great place with good food at the right prices. Ideal for the student crowd of the nearby Jadavpur University as well as the various research institutes like IICB, IACS, CGACRI etc. The decor is cosy indeed. They have a reasonably extensive menu. Last time we went there we had the fried prawn tempura and the prawn arabian salt and pepper. Both were well made and delicious. For the main course we had egg wrapped fried rice accompanied by General Tso's chicken. The egg wrapped fried rice was wonderfully presented. Moving on the drinks and desserts we had tutty fruity ice cream, something called arabian nights ice cream and a delightful mocktail which went by the name of Humpty Dumpty. All in all it was a delightful experience. Full marks to the management for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in the restaurant as well.

The food here is delicious and quite fresh. Have tried probably all dishes of chicken and they're all pretty good. Prawn is also fresh and well cooked here. Meifoon, Fried rice and Noodles are amazing. Prices are reasonable. Only little complaint is about the delivery services. 
Keep it up, CB!

Anyway. .I do hope they buckle up soon on this issue and continue to deliver good food to feed a hungry foodie..

I've had this on my list for sometime and finally managed to have a grab. The restaurant is located just behind the petrol pump near Sukanta Setu, Sulekha. It's a two storied building. It might be a trouble locating it coz the restaurant is not on the roadside.

The ambiance is at par, nothing to appreciate. The waiters are very courteous and the service received was quite good.

We settled for Hong Kong Noodles(Non-Veg) , Hunan chicken, Mixed Fried Rice, Butter Naan and Balti Chicken. The Hong Kong Noodles tasted awesome but the Hunan Chicken failed to impress. The Hunan Chicken tasted more like Chilli Chicken which was a fail. Mixed Fried Rice was good. Balti Chicken tasted really good and the Naan was well made.

The cost was well within the range and the quantity was well enough for two people.

P.S: After receiving such service it was worthwhile to keep it on my list.

Disappointing experience. Never going to order again.

We're pretty regular at this place. 
The first thing, that comes in my mind about Bistro, is "crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce"... that beautiful smell and crispy slightly lime taste makes it a must try over here.. Caribbean Drumstick and Firecracker chicken are also among the popular choices... I like the lung fung soup quite a lot over here... This place also serves General Tsao's chicken and lemon chicken which are pretty decent... My personal fav in rice/noodles section would be egg wrapped fried rice.. and Drunken noodles.. I m not very veg guy.. But Crispy Konjie baby corn is a good try.. :)

Had a very good dining experience over here. Calcutta bistro located at sulekha really serves fabulous dishes. One must go there to taste the chinese dishes. The quantity is much more than the amount. One plate serves two. The mocktail was awesome.The biriyani and Tandoori chicken was also delicious. Really wanna go there again..

Loved Egg Wrapped Rice. 
Loved Kungpao Chicken.
Service quality just OK
Major setback - I was having dinner with 2 of my opposite gender suddenly I discover the table next 2 us was occupied by 3 (NOT-SO-GENTLE-MAN) Uncles, all of them were drunk & was having fun with each other using cheap slangs(in Dolby Digital Sound).
That made my night into a nightmare.
Never going back there to seat & eat

My suggestion would be keeping the menu simple and you will absolutely be happy after that perfect lunch or dinner. Pocket pinch is minimal.

Decor is minimalistic, ambience is below average , the only thing this restro boasts of is its popularity amidst localities and students alike and good quantity of food. I was feeling  hungry while passing this joint and decided to give it a try. I ordered lung fung soup which turned out to be quite spicy, prawn Arabian salt n pepper and carribean drumstick as starters. The prawn was delectable but the chicken  dish could have been better. As for the main course, I went for mixed gravy chowmein  which was average. The only thing I genuinely liked about the place was the politeness and efficiency of the staff. Other aspects need to improve drastically.

Calcutta Bistro is an authentic chinese restaurant. A good variety of chinese foods they have in their menu to offer. But somehow they take a long time to serve their orders. If you are hungry and want food at the earliest then forget visiting here. Quanity is appealing enough but do not depend on the quality.

Very astonished to see that after Ordering Thai pad Noodles we were served with meefoon and when asked the F&B manager told us that they use meefoon as Thai pad noodles. Totally misconception in menu to run a Restaurant like this where people don't know the difference between the type of noodles which they have mentioned in menu and General Tao's chicken without roasted peanuts was very Surprising. Would suggest to have any Asian cuisine in any other place other than Calcutta Bistro where people don't know what the guests need by viewing there menu they prepare food According to there choice

This place is  located behind a petrol pump near Sukanta Setu great if you are under a budget and want to give a party or a treat to your friends. I have gone to this place many times also ordered home delivery.This place is more frequented by students.They provide good food at a reasonable price and the portions of the food is also great( 1 dish is more than enough for 2 people).They have a huge variety of dishes and all of them are always available and are tasty.The ambiance and the service of wait staff are great, their home delivery service is also great.This restaurant makes equally good Tandoori and Chinese items.My absolute favorites are Crispy fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce(crispy fish in mildly flavored sauce),Murg Lasuni Kebab,Egg Wrapped Fried Rice and lung fung soup.

Location- It is located just behind the petrol pump near Sukanto setu sulekha (Jadavpur).Very easy to find. Though it gets covered by huge banners of the petrol pump but they have a hoarding  or else you can ask any  person they will guide you.

Ambiance-The restaurant is 2 stored. Casual, clean and lightly dim. The staff are courteous. They are quick with their delivery. They serve in huge proportion, if 2 people are going take for 1. 

Food- very tasty! Not that spicy. There Chinese is better than Indian. Since i have been to this place so many times i have lost track of which food was good and all. But there Drumsticks for starter was great, for main course there Noddles and Rice are well cooked. As for side dish one should take Garlic Chicken, Balti chicken( which they literally serve in a small balti),Hunana chicken and chicken manchurian. Even there Biryani is light and my mother liked it.

Price-  They dont charge any tax! so definitely reasonable. You will not get such huge quantity and of such quality in any other restaurant i guarantee .

AND no , reservation is not required :p

Calcutta Bistro can be categorized under "student's favorite restaurants" for the affordable food they serve.
I've been here quite a few times and I must say that the interiors are quite good for a restaurant that serves food at such low rates.
As far as the food quality is concerned, I'd say it varies. Sometimes it's delectable and then again I do have a memory of an incident where we were served "burnt" noodles.
On my last visit to the bistro, we had drunken noodles (a spicy preparation of flat noodles), chicken peanut and butter noodles ( a spicy preparation of flat noodles with the twist of butter and the crunch of peanuts), Mongolian rice (rice topped with vegetables,chicken and prawns in white sauce), General Tso's chicken (meatballs in a bed of spicy black sauce) and Shao Xiang chicken (chicken cut in shape of tiny patties served in a white sauce with cashews).
Anyone who loves spicy food will for sure love Drunken noodles and Chicken peanut n butter noodles. I know the combination of peanuts and butter don't quite sound great along with noodles, even I was quite apprehensive about having it but then we went ahead and ordered it just for the sake of trying something new and to my surprise it did taste good.

Mongolian rice and Shao Xiang chicken are for the ones who love their food less spicy. I personally wouldn't recommend any of these to anyone mainly cause both of them were too bland for my taste. The description of Shao Xiang chicken in the menu card clearly states cashew to be one of the major ingredients, however, the sauce the chicken was served in barely tasted of cashews. One only finds a few cashews scattered here and there on the service platter.

I also do have a few words about the staff. They are friendly and courteous. However, I did find it strange when in spite of asking the staff to suggest something spicy amongst the chicken delicacies for us he chose Shao Xiang chicken, which as I've stated before is not spicy at all. Maybe, the waiters should be trained better so they would know well what food they serve.

Calcutta Bistro is a nice multi-cuisine restaurant to hang out at. Although I tried their Chinese dishes only, so I am restricting my review on their Chinese dishes only.
Quantity that they serve is very good. The Egg wrapped fried rice Mongolian fried rice are very good. Most of the chicken side dishes that I have tried are exciting as far as the taste is concerned.  For starter pan fried chilli fish is a really good option.
Just  one piece of advice for them 
 I think people working there are not courtesious enough .

The whole experience for me was marred by this"restaurant". We live in a competitive market and there are loads of choices around that area. Why did I go to Calcutta bistro? Because it was recommended to me. The restaurant was fairly empty when I went in so I got a seat as soon as I got in. However, the staff and the manager were ill prepared. They don't know about their own menu and couldn't guide me with any ideas. So I settled for some starter. The food was mediocre and un-inspired at best. Nothing to write home about. You could bring those pesky friends from college or those out of town relatives with their annoying kid here, cause the food is a bit cheaper. I wouldn't recommend bringing your date here, unless you're broke and cheap 😆.

It was my best friends birthday treat and when we reached their we were fully drenched and famished. So we ordered:
Crispy chili babycorn: its was spicy sweet n very crispy
Schezuan rice: well spiced and very good quantity
Pineapple fried rice: I loved this one. Pineapple prawn cashew came in correct class combination. I could really have it without any side dish.
Nabaratna rice: it was from Indian section and pure veg. It came with lots fruits and dry fruits and I loved it
Chicken in black bean sauce: the dish was too  overwhelmed by sauce that we could hardly eat the gravy
Chicken butter masala: tasted good
Veg makhanwala: it was really very tasty. A hardcore non vegetarian like me even liked it more than the chicken
The place looked good, tasted good, gave good quantity and moderately priced.
The only con I found was the staffs - they were a bit rude and non friendly..

Took a home delivery from here to Garia on a Friday evening. They said that they would deliver if the order was above 1000rs.
The Caribbean chicken drumstick was good but on the spicier side. What I really loved was the Hunan chicken. Quite different from other places and light on the taste buds with mushrooms and spring onions. Mandarin fish is also good. White sauce based. Rice quantity is huge. A couple can share easily. But they can improve on the Fried rice which I felt wasn't up to the mark. Lacked quality of rice and preparation.
Overall a good option with low price.

Last night,me and my wife visited  Calcutta Bistro for dinner. We drop in there once in a while because  the restaurant offers excellent(especially chinese) food at reasonable prices ,one of the best among the nearby restaurants.To our surprise,the place was crowded and we  had to wait for sometime to get in,probably as it was a holiday(Rathyatra and Eid).
                     We ordered Thai Tom Yum soup,Pan Fried chicken,Mixed gravy noodles and fish moffato . The quantity of the food as usual was good,but what was really disappointing was that the food quality was extremely ordinary and especially  the soup,mixed gravy noodles and the fish item were almost tasteless. We were really surprised with the  poor quality of the food which was unprecedented at the restaurant and wondered whether it was due to the excessive crowd or whether it reflected a recent decline in food quality.Hope that they do not let us down and maintain  their good reputation in future.

Calcutta Bistro is located right next to the petrol pump station at Sukanto Setu crossing. This is a very popular restaurant, and remains full during festive seasons, for it provides good food at reasonable price.

I've been here for a couple of times. The first time, it was on the day of Saraswati Puja, and we had to stand in a long queue for around 30-40 minutes maybe. I had Mixed Hakaka Noodles, and Chilli Chicken. The noodles I was served had the pieces of prawns, chicken, egg, and few other vegetables all burnt. It looked burnt, tasted burnt, and smelled burnt. When I complained this to a waiter, he said, it's the specialty of their noodles. After asking them for a few more times, they agreed to replace it. Within 10 minutes, what they brought to me was similar- burnt. The chicken pieces were good though.

The next time I visited, it was a normal day, and I didn't have to wait to get a seat for the two of us. We ordered for Pan Fried Chicken, Mixed Hakka Noodles, and Schezuan Chicken. What they got us instead was Pan Fried Chilli Fish! They were very reluctant to replace it with what we had ordered. Anyway, the sauce was good, but the pieces of fish lacked the taste of good fish. This time however the noodles was not burnt, and it tasted great. The chicken was good.

I'd have given them 3.5, but the two bad experiences made me deduct 0.5 from their ratings. Also service time is a tad bit slow.

It was a quiet Saturday night when I visited this place with my boyfriend. We were really pretty hungry and hence we were quite relieved not to see any queue in front of the restaurant, which is a common sight at this place. Seated comfortably on the first floor, we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken and Choupsey. As usual, the quantity of the fried rice dish was substantial. In fact, so was the choupsey. The food tasted good too, and we had a pretty decent time filling ourselves up. After the main course, we helped ourselves to a glass of Pinacolada each. The staff were pleasant as has always been the case. It wasnt the first time we were visiting this place, and definitely it wont be the last. Mainly because, it is indeed one of the best restaurants in Jadavpur area considering ease of access, price and quality. So, we would wish to be back there trying some other meal some other time.

Located just behind the Sulekha, Jadavpur  petrol pump makes it a little hard to locate. There is a bit problem for parking.

On entering the restaurant I was quite attracted. It has two floors and the ambience is  worth mentioning. The things that stole my glance are the cleanliness, the interior design and the decorum of the trained waiters.

We were offered a seat for two and from that time onward the waiters assisted us till the end of the dinner.

Ordered a hot and sour soup first which was a quite brilliant appetizer. Then the waiter suggested to take SINGAPORE FRIED RICE and HUNAN FISH for main course.

To my surprise the food quality was quite good and can be compared to any four star restaurant and the garnishing was alluring. To be truthful it met my expectation and I had a good dinner.

To state the cons the table we were offered was a bit small and the absence of a good parking place.

Delicious courses,served in good quantity and at reasonable rates.Recommended for family dinners.Or birthday treats(if your group is not into pizzas and all).

Not ALL items are good.You need to choose properly ofcourse.
My recommendations would be :
Pan Fried Fish.
Thai Chicken,if you like it spicy.
Schezwan Rice with Sweet and Sour Chicken for people with a sweet-tooth.
Mughlai dishes are okay.

Dim-lights and red sofas add to the ambience which is decent and nice.

Well first of all, this place doesn't have the Bistro feel today. It is more like a flat turned into a restaurant. But the ambience was nice and their decor is minimal so that the customers can solely focus on the food.
For starters, we ordered the Caribbean Drumsticks. It was smothered in a sweet and spicy Schezwan sauce with hints of garlic, spring onion and ginger. The fried and coated  chicken was crispy and juicy. They refrained from using any artificial coloring which is definitely a plus. Next we ordered Prawns cooked in garlic sauce and Hongkong spicy noodles with chicken and egg. The noodles had a nice tangy taste to it and it was loaded with chicken and egg pieces. The portion is quite big for two. It was mildly spicy and hence they spice didn't over power the other flavors of the dish. The prawns were quite big in size but the coating on it rendered them chewy. The sauce was a light garlicy sauce with tiny bits of garlic strewn in it. 
Overall, a definitely nice place to visit with good, authentic and flavorful dishes.

Heard about this place a lot, from friends and of course saw the excellent reviews in zomato. Place is near my home but never got a chase of dining there. Finally went with one of my friend and had pad thai noodles and chicken wings with honey syrup - really can't write anything good. Only the decor and all is good, soothing.. A pleasant ambience whatsoever but the food was aweful. The noodles especially was  sweeter than its supposed to be, the service was sluggish (we waited for not less than 45 minutes to get our food) although the waiters were quick to pull away our plates even though we didn't complete. All I expected was some decent food as it's supposed to be. Well I'm awfully disappointed.  :(

Had awesome experience every time I visit this restaurant. The quality and quantity of the foods are really great. 1 serving is sufficient for 2 people. Though sometimes they take quite long time to serve a dish but the foods will simply blow your mind. Service and ambience are also good. Recently they have started taking 20% service tax. Their home delivery service is also good. It's fast and free.

A nice restaurant, been here few times with friends for dinner. Chinese dishes are excellent and the price is also reasonable. Drunken Noodles is a must try if you are a fan of noodles, specially flat noodles. They take time to prepare this dish but its worth the waiting. Side dishes like General Tso's Chicken and Mongolian Chicken goes great with the noodles.

The favoured eating and meeting place near my hospital. I've been there many times, like today, with friends who've now become colleagues. So this time I went there with three friends of mine. Spacious restaurant. Nice ambience. Lovely decor. Serves at about more than 40+ people at any time so you won't be left waiting for long. We went there to have lunch together. We ordered Veg Chili Garlic noodles, Drunken noodles, Thai fish, sautéed chicken with celery and pepper, Paneer butter masala. The food was served after 20 mints or so. Food was tasty as always. Loved the sautéed chicken and Thai fish, you must try them. For desserts, Arabian Delights. Even that was excellent. Price 1495 rupees. I think that's affordable for a good lunch for four people. Decor, food, ambience, washroom - excellent. The staff - helpful. But you'd like to have the food served a lil earlier, sometimes. Four stars.

Reading the other reviews of this place my expectation was towards the higher side but am very sad to say that i was disappointed. The first draw back of the place is size...it gets very congested inside and specially the table for two are two small to keep the plates and the dishes together. And when it comes to food I just dontlike grumpy faces...and here the waiters were all so disinterested to serve or take the order. the courteousness was lacking all the way. Coming to the most significant area, food: we ordered a chicken lung fung soup which looked very unappealing because  of the netted egg smeared over it in a wrong way. then came pepper fish which was just a bit more warmer than cold, though the taste was good. In main course ordered chilli garlic noodle, which didn't have any flavour of garlic. when i said this to the waiter he said they use garlic powder and not real garlic in the dish that's why there is no strong flavour. I mean seriously! whatever,  we had chicken with cashew nut with the noodles which too didn't has any different taste than chilli chicken with some added cashew in it. One positive of this place is that the quantity of food is very decent and price wise its okayish, but definitely not worth of what they serve!

They serve decent Chinese n North Indian food at a low price.I tried the Chinese dishes there..almond chicken in lemon honey sauce,schezuan chicken,panfried chicken,schezuan fried rice,singapore fried rice.In the desserts I end up having the caramel custard everytime..its so yummy! All the dishes I tried here are really good.Being so pocket friendly is another positive side of this place.
Today I went there for a friend's birthday treat and I have to say that the lungfung soup, chilli garlic noodles, hot garlic chicken, stir fried chicken with chilli and cashews and egg wrapped fried rice are worth mentioning. .tasted amazing! Other dishes we had were firecracker chicken, chicken in blackbean sauce and a mixed fried rice.We ended our meal with a fresh lime soda which was good too.

The only setback with respect to this restaurant is that it has no car parking space. You have to park car on the main road beside petrol pump and while sitting in the restaurant, suffer from tension regarding the fate of your car - did anyone object to its parking there? Did any rough vehicle just smashed it? Did the police take note of it?

Apart from it, it is a nice cozy place. The food is perfect. I had taken sweet corn chicken soup and Carribean chicken drumstick. The soup was light and delicious, the drumsticks fat and juicy. The staff knowledgeable and attentive.The next time I go there, I shan't take my car so that I would be able to enjoy more.

Calcutta Bistro is one of the best places for Chinese food, not only because it is pocket-friendly, but also because the food is simply delicious. The servers are prompt and attentive, the ambiance is both elegant and comfortable and the quantity was more than enough. It's a good place to eat whether you are out on a date, or with family or just a hangout with friends.

So, if you ever get a hankering for Chinese, Calcutta Bistro is a fine choice!

Our pick- Schezwan fried rice, Crispy Chili Babycorn and Hunan Chicken.

Well I visited this place about 3 or months back. One of my colleague gave us his birthday treat there. The entrance of the place is bit confusing for the first comers but as you get to see the board of Calcutta Bistro on the road you can easily find your way through the lane to the restaurant. 
Well we were the gang of 20 people over there and for my friends birthday treat we asked to order combo dinner for oneself so that, he doesn't have to return home empty pocket. 😜 
The food was really good no doubt, but the service was not up to the mark and I was irritated with it. But no issue may be because so many of us were there. So may be it got bit confusing for the waiters and for us too. But the food there was good. Like one would love the food. Hope to visit it next time so that I can understand the service well this time. ☺

A really good VFM restaurant.
The location is the tricky part for newbies, as it is in a lane but once you see the sign with Calcutta Bistro written and follow the shady lane, you find the treasure.... er .... I mean the restaurant.
It's a treasure indeed, for people who have wallets slim, hungry stomach and a search for good food.
Now this restaurant serves in two levels, luck will tell on which level you'll be seated.
The staffs are warm, a tad bit late in serving the food, but they help you out with what to choose without any frown.

Coming to the food, the Chinese food is good, just good, with great amounts  (even though I saw other named restaurants giving a somewhat large quantity at this price point).
We had the chicken noodles and hunan chicken (if I remember).It tasted great, the hunan chicken could have been better but the prices dared we didn't complain.
2 plates of noodles and a hunan chicken and the bill comes 550-ish so it was really a happy affair.
A great restaurant to fill up one's stomach without an empty pocket

Located behind the sulekha petrol pump, this place has a nice ambience, friendly staff, is reasonably priced n most importantly, serves great food. The pan fried fish is one of their best dishes. Also must try the egg wrapped fried rice, chilli garlic noodles, thai chicken n kung pao chicken. Yet to try their indian dishes but have heard that it's equally good.

Calcutta Bistro was in my wish list for a long long time and even though the place is not too far away from my house, I didn't get the opportunity to try it out until recently. There were four of us and we ordered Indian as well as Chinese dishes (all four of us can eat a lot). The food was amazing, really good the quantity was more than enough. Coming to the decoration and ambience, seating is apt not too great and interiors are just fine. Try this place out if you're on a strict budget and want some great food.

This place I have been to more than a dozen times literally! And that aught to speak for itself, a little hidden from ordinary sight( thank God !else I can't imagine the crowd) to speak in fewest possible words: its decor is good. Its food in terms of quality and quantity I doubt has any competition in considering the price they provide it for! Their crispy chilly babycorn is to die for! No kidding!!! Oohhh a bonus their sundaes are luxurious too being heaped in fruits and choicest sauces!

Expenditure / VFM : 400 for 2 people

Ambience/ Service : Plain surrounding and decor. Quick Service.

What to Order: Gravy Noodles. Starters are good.
The food in terms of taste and quality are above average. Special mention to the gravy noodles which is made better than most places (0.5 extra rating for that). We generally order in from this place and we've always experienced timely delivery. One problem is the sauce packets that come with the dishes during delivery - even after repeatedly asking for more of these packets, they only send one or two of those. Overall, a decent eatery when you don't wanna burden your wallet.

Visited Calcutta Bistro with friends. It's a very apt place to be if you are looking for good food; if not extraordinary and which is very pocket friendly. The ambience is quite ok for a friends or family get together. The staff members are very courteous but yes service is a bit slow. That can be ignored mostly because the food you are about to get after the wait will keep you occupied for sure. The prawn items, Thai Chicken, Hong Kong Fried Rice (Mixed), Navaratna Pulao, Reshmi Chicken Butter Masala are really good. The Deserts and Mocktails are also above average. Altogether it's a worthy place to be....

And you should definitely try their buttered prawns, egg-wrapped rice, chilli garlic noodles and general tso's chicken. See, you've already got a great entrée menu! The amount is pretty good . If you are still in college and have to treat your friends, you can comfortably head on.. And yes... Don't forget to order a caramel custard if you are taking your special one ;-)

It is hard to find it is behind the petrol pump and there is a small sign bord so it is difficult to get I there. 
Now the food I have order Peper Fish , Murg Lehsuni, Mutton Do Pyaza, Naan, Garlic Naan & Masala Kulcha. And in Chinese Chicken Hong Kong and Mixed Hakka Noodle.
The stated was very good the fish was melting in mouth and the garlic flavor in chicken make it different from other chicken staters.
Mutton do pyaza was not good the dominant flavor of the spices used in it and the naan's was good but not best the worst is mashala Kulcha its thin and hard.
The chicken Hong Kong was good average Chinese chicken preparation but the mixed hakka noodle was very good and the quantity was enough for two people. It was a mixed experience some of the dishes was very good but some of not up to the mark it's poket friendly nice ambience nice staffing the only the need to improve is the taste of food and make some big sign for the restaurant way.

It was my friend's birthday and had gone there for dinner.Had heard very good reviews of this place and its always crowded so decided to drop in.
We ordered Indian cuisine,however chinese is also available and tastea good as well as i have heard.
Moving to the food we ordered lasuni kabab and mutton sheekh kabab, the kababs were soft,succulent and juicy and just melts in the mouth.For mains we order basic butter naan and chicken kali mirch and it tasted good as well.The bill came upto 800 which was pretty reasonable.
The staff are very corteous and the place is simple yet bright.nothing over the top.
Its a good local eatery and definitely worth a visit.

I have been in Calcutta bistro last week for the 3rd time i guess and I would love to visit again and again. The foods are awesome. Last week, we've ordered Fish Moffato and Pan fried chicken as starter and both r equally nice and tasty. Then for the main course we ordered Hong Kong Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken in Hot Black Bean Sauce. I personally loved the Hong Kong fried Rice very much and would recommend to try this one out. On the contrary, I find the Kung Pao chicken a bit sour but though I loved it and the chicken in black bean sauce was very nice and tasty.

Definitely the joint for petuk Bangalis on a shoestring budget. Their lemongrass chicken, chili babycorn and Singapore Noodles are TO die for!

However, some of their items may taste similar such as chili baby corn and hot garlic prawns. Exercise caution, and ask your server to help you out with the menu choices.

The portions are great and will feed two people to their gills! Don't hesitate to try their mocktails either :D

Hmm..where 2 to start from.. one of the most "pocket friendly" restaurant serving mouth watering dishes.. place is pretty cool with no extra unnecessarily added features or so called interior decoration.. very homely atmosphere..
The "must try" dish is chicken tandoori.. very reasonable.. fleshy..juicy.. and very indian in taste.. it was served with a green chutney which I remember I had a whole cup of that.. rest many other chinese items like garlic noodles.. chilly babycorn & sooo on will also satisfy someone's hunger.. also, mughlai dishes like naan, chicken butter masala etc is very delicious & tasty.. service is quite good..
In short its simply wonderful.. it will give u a restaurant "next door" wala feeling.. difficult to get seats at times..but people wait in big lines with full patience to enjoy every bit of their money they have accumulated for this meal.. once again I repeat it, this place will give u a "home like" atmosphere..
& one cant complete a meal without having tandoori chicken.. :)
Would surely love to go here again & again..

Great food and nice ambience are the remarkable characteristics of this place. Though had an unpleasant experience of a staff misbehaving with our group. We also had to wait for almost 40mins after we placed the order. But the food was undoubtedly best of its kind. We also received an apology for the wait and the misbehaviour  later on. Personal favorites: reshmi chicken butter masala, chicken do piaza.

Located behind the sulekha petrol pump, this place is a very common place to dine out for mainly the students of kpcmch and jadavpur university, and also for the residents of jadavpur, santoshpur, and baghajatin.. And, because of their delicacies, portions they serve, well trained waiters, and mostly, affordable price, this place has earned a lot of good name..from soups to desserts, all are deliocious to savour.. However, my personal favourite are, panfried chicken, caribbean drumsticks, egg wrapped friedrice, thai chicken basil friedrice, kungpau chicken..

Location : It is a downside, as it is located behind a petrol pump and finding the entrance could take some time
Ambiance : Nice, cozy.
Food : Quantity and Quality are both above average and sure to tickle your taste buds
Price : Reasonable

Suggestion : Kung Pao Chicken is amazing. Do mention them beforehand if you don't like your food too spicy, as they tend to go for high notes on spices.

Calcutta Bistro is my all time favourite one!! The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering delicacies and the food is yummy. Both the quality as well as the quantity of the food items and the presentation is just over the top. The ambience and the hospitality is very good. I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.

We all love to have tasty foods and it tastes yummier when the place is pocket friendly. And that's the USP of Calcutta bistro. Food is awesome, area could have been a little bigger. A group of 10-12 people would be a trouble for them. And as I said earlier,food is delicious irrespective of what you choose. A perfect place for college students and group hangouts.

Located right on SC Mullick Road, near Sulekha, Calcutta Bistro has good neat and clean dining facility. They also do home delivery. 
They have really good kebabs. What I like most is their Chinese preparations.
The mixed gravy and mixed hakka chowmein are both sumptuous. All in all a good place to go for a reasonably priced lunch or dinner. I frequently order their chowmeins and kebabs and I am never disappointed.

Update: Tried the chicken bharta and kadai chicken... Yummy.

We went there for the anniversary celebrations of my parents. Had kung pao chicken, chicken thai soup, hakka noodles and singapore fried rice. All the items were simply mindboggling. We were discussing that these items probably could not be made in this fashion elsewhere in Kolkata. The ambience was also great. Quite spacious. The hospitality was also very good.

Calcutta Bistro is situated beside the petrol pump at Sulekha, Jadavpur. The interior is pretty impressive. Two floors. The first floor witnesses a lot of guests than the ground floor! The waiters are amiable and service time is also good. We had ordered for lung fung soup and it was delicious. Though it is a multi cuisine i guess the chinese is better here! The pan fried chicken was yummy too. The quantity is worth a mention. We were full by just the starters. For the main course we had American Chop suey and a side dish of prawn. We also took pan fried noodles. The taste was nice though for the pan fried I believe it was a little undercooked. The prices are not too high but given the quantity the prices are justified. A good dining place at a convenient location. :)

Size of the Restaurant: Medium, two floors.
Ambiance: Nice and cozy.
Service: Prompt (though our visit was not during rush hours)
Quality of food: Better than average.
Quantity: HUGE 
Price: Reasonable (not cheap)

We tried egg-wrap fried rice and chicken cashew nut from Chinese main course. Both were innovative. They wrapped the whole portion of mixed fried rice within a thin egg-omlette. We were pretty surprised when the thing arrived. It's pretty commendable. 
As of the cashew nut chicken, it came with little pieces of chicken, lots of cashew nut, babycorn and other vegetables. I personally didn't like the taste much, though both of my friends I was visiting this place with, absolutely loved it. 

p.s. As I got to know from some of the reviews here that they don't apply extra charges on food price; I guess I should update this information. They do apply tax as per the norm in the final bill now.

Calcutta bistro fulfils its name of bistro. It is indeed a small place which serves reasonably priced food. But the compromise is not with the quality of the food which is better than average. The Chinese food is good but nothing special about it. North indian is maybe tad better. Ambience is okayish n service is also good but a tad slow. Overall all a small eatery with some quality food n ambience without much pocket pinch.
P.s. Kung pao chicken is highly recommended ?

I visited this place a lot of times. If you searching for a pocket friendly restaurant and some good food to fill your appetite, this is the right place in the locality. 
They serve you both north Indian and Chinese.  So people with different taste can dine in together. 
Quality of food is great, especially Chinese dishes. They also have a category of "today's special" which is really good to have.
The staffs are helpful with choosing the dishes.

There are two floors and table reservation is recommended on weekends or any other holidays.
One must try the egg-wrapped fried rice and chicken drum-sticks. 
Happy eating!

Located near the 8B bus stand of Jadavpur, this place is really a nice visit. It's a bit hard to find because it's located behind a petrol pump and in an enclosed area but you can ask one and they will let you know.
Lowly lit and full AC, it's an okay place if you look for classy stuff, if not. Then go for it.

Okay. To food. Just ordered a gravy chicken chow and it in short is really good and the quantity is ample. Enough for two almost. It's really good, the food.

Now. The negatives. They serve slow and the ambience is nothing great like said before. Otherwise for a good bite in relatively cheap rates. Go for it.

Located right behind jadavpur petrol pump, it is one of the few multi cuisine diners in the area. Had read a lot about it. Finally decided to pay it a visit. We had to wait over 10mins for a table for 4. Finally inside, the decor was good. But it was jam packed. However, once our food came, we were not sure what all the buzz was about. We had ordered indian and the quality was not upto the mark. For what's worth it, once bitten twice shy sums up my exposure to this place. Been there. Done that!

Despite great reviews from friends, I found this restaurant strictly average. Had the Caribbean drumsticks and I have to add, there was nothing Carribean about it; it tasted like plain old hot and sweet chicken drumsticks. Also, if you're looking for good drumsticks, Kimli is way better. The crispy chicken is an abomination in terms of the quantity- a sparse handful of alarmingly red chicken strips at a barely-mid-level restaurant like this doesn't deserve Rs. 150, I'm sorry. 

The main course entailed a friend rice and Schezwan chicken both of which were unremarkably average. I have eaten at this place only once before and that too almost three years ago. Even back then, I had found it fell short of expectations that its devout patrons have created. My opinion remains unchanged.

On 15th Oct 2017 I went to this place with 16 other friends for celebrating my birthday.
Everything was ok till a waiter came and rudely and very much harshly said "ashte kotha bolun onnoder problem hocche" Now my question is I had booked the table for that day almost 1 week earlier, then u have not said that there might be a problem if we celebrate. And celebration of a birthday with 17 people can't go in whispers, i think all those who objected know this. And when I asked for the manager the manager was not there.

Calcutta Bistro.. its a good place for family dinner, i went with my brother and sister. we headed straight to the first floor, the ambience in the ground floor and first floor was extremely controversial. the ambience was soothing with dim light they could play a light music in background which was missing.. we decided to go for Indian, we were told by a staff to order Irani kebabs which is not listed in the menu to give a try.. the kebabs they were just awesome, juicy and never had like that, then came crispy chicken i was disappointed with it, the chicken was very dry one cannot eat it without a sauce... then came the kulcha and chicken tikki masala.. both were good enough.. we cannot complain  or compare it with the other once as the price goes too easy on pocket... overall its a good place for dining one may give a try.. i would surely go for the chinese next time... was happy with it overall ...

This was one of the places I'd been literally pining for, and it did happen today with two of my buds.

It's hard to miss though, it's luminary signboard close to the petrol station at Jadavpur. Inside, nice and cosy - but the food (and the price) is what simply blew us away.

We had ordered the Chicken Shahi Biriyani, the Badshahi Kaju Chicken, the Butter Naan, and their signature rice noodles, all of which were both excellent, presentation-wise and taste-wise. Special mentions go to the Kaju Chicken though - that gravy was to die for. It's really not very hard on the pocket, as we ate to our heart's content while the bill came to about 220 bucks per person.

The staff are courteous too, which makes it a very good culinary experience.

Definitely coming here again.

Let me first clarify myself that I'm perfectly in my sense when i am writing  this feedback. Calcutta bistro is one of the finest restaurants in the city when it comes to the taste ,  ambience or the quality of the food. People may not believe this  , they might go for a classy restaurant but calcutta bistro really serves the value for money. I went there for more than 5 times and everytime my experience was better than before. Every dish we ordered was of superior quality and  our taste buds  were satisfied like never before. I would recommend this place as a 'must go' for everyone.

The only thing I liked about this place was the Butter Prawn they served. It was perfectly cooked in South Indian Style and the taste was good. The experience we had with the rest of the dishes were really terrible. One could easily predict how sweet the chef must be from the amount of sugar he added to each and every preparation (even Schezwan Chicken was one of those). lol. The Cost is on the lower side and this can be the reason why you may think of dropping in there. There is no way I am going back there though. Definitely not...

TOTAL VALUE FOR MONEYThe ambiance of the place is perfect for casual dining; be it with friends or family.The best part is that all the taxes are included in the food menu and yet it is much cheaper than many similar type of restaurants in Kolkata.
Visited the place a couple of days back with 2 of my friends.
Ordered: Murg malai kebab, Chicken Iranian Kebab, Pepper Fish, Crispy Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Mongolian Chicken & Desserts.Quality: Its mouth watering. Chicken & Fish were fresh, tender and served hot. Iranian Kebab and Pepper Fish are a must try since they had a unique enchanting taste to it.Quantity: Each dish can be divided between two comfortably.Cons: Quite a bit of time was taken to serve the dishes, especially the desserts and one of the waiters was not polite enough. Hence the deduction of a point.All in all this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

And now they have started taking taxes which was not there earlier. A tax of 20.1% including vat and service tax. So don't tip anymore.

Had heard about the good restaurants in jadavpur from many of my friends and so on the occasion of a treat tried this one out! Calcutta bistro is a place where you want to be when your craving good tasty food and its the end of the month!! Along with good taste they provide you a great quantity which will make you jump up on your toes! We were a group of 9 and had ordered gravy noodles,Hakka noodles,hongkong rice,kungpao chicken and Hunan fish! All of the dishes were very satisfying to the stomach and after visiting this place I can surely tell that Calcutta bistro will make the foodie in you pleased!!!

Having read rave reviews about this place, my husband and I went for a snack after work last week. We ordered tomato soup with basil and egg flower and fish flakes. The soup was very strong flavored with an aromatic taste, not very pleasant. We ended up ordering rice to dilute the taste. Then we ordered chicken sweet corn soup just to eat something predictable and comforting. The rice was in excess after eating the tomato soup. So we order Peshawari paneer which was bland and neutralized the zingy taste of the soup. Having thus eaten a completely hotchpotch meal which spoilt our dinner, we packed some crispy kronjee chicken and prawn tempura to bring home for the kids who loved them. So overall, not a pleasant experience. The restaurant itself is tucked away in one corner of Jadavpur and you really have to be a foodie to even find the place.

On my last day of vacations in Kolkata, decided to end it with Chinese!
So I ordered chicken fried rice with chicken manchurian. It was good and well made. Didnt expect it to be this good. It was surely value for money in terms of price and the quantity served. Worth trying this out!

I have been here twice & both on the occasion of my friends' birthday treat. This place two floors of dining area!! This place offers chinese as well as north indian..

I've had chinese from here namely chicken hakka chowmein,Chicken manchurian & drums of heaven which all tastes great. From north indian side I've had butter naan,reshmi butter masala & drums of heaven equally appealing to the eye & the taste buds.. The bill in my visit came to around 800(consisting of 4 persons) & 1300(consisting of 8 persons).. so yes this place is pocket friendly & offers quality & peaceful dining experience

Pals this the best restaurant in Jadavpur area for family dining. If you want to fill up your tummy with stupendous dainty this is the place you should take a visit to.
The staffs are courteous and would engage themselves in each and every need of yours with a polite and big smile.
Cost for two would be around 500-600, though it depends on your order.

Spending 6 years in Jadavpur from the age of 17 to 23 as a Jadavpur Univeristy student became a finer and better experience just because of Calcutta Bistro. It has negativeities just as all other food hubs do have. But above all the affordable prices and the plethora of dishes served at this restaurant was overwhelmingly good  every time!
I have tasted each and every dish available here and have visited it may be more than 50 times during my entire stay at Jadavpur!
All I can say given the hardships and thin pocket condition of a student, bistro is the best place to relish and savor and let the gourmet come out if it is within you!
If anyone is interested to give a first visit, try Singapore/Hong kong fried rice and Tikka and Reshmi Chiken butter masala!! They will win your heart definitely.

The said restaurant is not so old and located just behind the filling station at sulekha more. The place needs to be renovated and work in there inside looks. Moreover there effort to make your taste buds satisfy seems worth. Among the near by restaurants in competition. Calcutta bistro is a worth choice to be at. The menu has got a standard set of dishes and really no complaints on there perpetration. Easy on pocket too... Truly Recommended...

Jack of all trades ! It's a multi cuisine restaurant with great Chinese and mughlai food. Basically a multi cuisine restaurant do not provide equally good multiple cuisine but this place is an exception,Chinese was equally good as mughlai. Fried rice and noodles were well prepared and taste was on par. Tandooris need a special mention. So food was excellent for the price it offered with good quantity which is my top priority with taste and this place didn't disappoint. Speaking of ambience the place is nice and cozy and will definitely make a nice gathering place. Highly recommended.

Calcutta bistro is a real bistro .Bistro is basically a French word that suggest some small eatery where food is reasonably priced. decoration3.5/5 for north Indian dishes 4/5 but for Chinese 3/5. Having tried chicken reshmi kabab as starter followed by chilli garlic noodles was quite a good going food journey. Kung pal chicken though was slightly better than average.Prawn items here are highly recommended .Deserts if not divine were great to treat UR taste buds.Service is a little slow. Phone reservation is kind of denied a couple of times.staffs are courteous but a little slow.

Bistro is a french word which means a small restaurant which serves quality food with minimal price range with quality seating arrangements. Calcutta Bistro is the perfect example of the given word..

Situated in Jadavpur,this place is really easy to locate,head down to Jadavpur and ask for Jadavpur petrol pump,a prominent landmark and easy to spot,Just beside the petrol pump you can see a neon board hanging saying Calcutta Bistro

Make your way through the small passage and you discover this place..

The place is perfectly lit nothing too fancy and you got tables on both the sides,they informed us that they have seating arrangements upstairs also but we preferred to sit on the base floor.

The tables were neatly covered with a faded yellow sheet and rose in the middle,we started going through the menu we ordered Lung Fung Soup,Mongolian Non veg Rice and Thai CHicken..
I would recommend Lung Fung Soup to everyone,the egg on top along with a pinch of lemon and healthy cubes of chicken is still one of the best items i ever tasted.. Mongolian Non veg fried rice was also great and it was perfectly matched with Thai Chicken which were both perfectly prepared.. 
As the name suggests this place is moderately priced and would cost around 500INR for a couple to enjoy a delicious and quality time.
Starting from quality,quantity,cleanliness and behaviour of staffs every thing was in the best possible way. The staffs were courteous and would engage themselves in each and every need of yours with a polite and big smile,,

Pros--
Quality of the food
Quantity
Behavior of Staffs
Cleanliness
Price range

Cons--
Ambience - separate tables for couples with a nice soothing music would be a great addition to this place

So to conclude loved my first experience over here and would love for a next visit hopefully with a massive improvement on Ambience..

Last time when I went to this restrau with my friends I was disheartened by the bad behaviour of the staffs..
However, I decided to try my luck once more yesterday and was pretty sure this time if the staffs behave badly I would make it sure that they get penalized but to my surprise this time the staffs were very friendly, they gave me ample time to decide on my dish.They were swift in serving water, had to wait only 5-10 minutes for the starter (Murg Reshmi Kebab) to come. Now coming to the food, the starter was succulent and a sheer joy to taste followed by wonderful main course ( Naan and Kadai Chicken). The kadai chicken was perfectly cooked, the gravy was tasty enough to please my tastebud neither too spicy nor too bland. The naan was soft like cotton.
All in all improved staff behaviour and as usual awesome quality food.
I would visit this place again and hope the improved staff behaviour prevails.

I've got a good approach to start this review, you know, like the tv serials or movies.
WARNING: This restaurant becomes a really unfriendly place on special occasions like saraswati puja, or any day when a crowd can turn up. Patience of mind and quick eating skills are advised. 
Now the Bistro is a very nice restaurant hidden behind an alleyway between jadavpur 8B and sulekha. However I'd implore you people to go to that place because it really could be lovely. Well I did not start off on good terms with this place since we had planned to throw a surprise treat for a friend, which involved me reaching the restaurant before the said friend. The idea, to wait till the said friend was pursuaded to come to this place however, did not sit well with the management. I understand that there was a crowd waiting and you people wanna make more money. However behaviour goes a long way and some people may not consider returning here. I even ordered some coffee to spend some time which was not available if a proper meal wasn't ordered. They said we could wait for 15 minutes. They did not let us wait for more than 5. If not for that I'd have given this place 4-4.5 because this place, it's ambience was just splendid. The setting was magical. I loved it. The tables could be a bit bigger though cause ours did become congested. The service was just a bit late. The food, regardless of every irritation I felt for this place, was absolutely awesome and it's the only thing compelling me to still give this a 3.5. It's like I took one bite and all the anger was replaced by taste-bud-satisfaction. It was wonderful. The taste was lovely, food was well cooked, the flavours were all oh-so-good. The quantity was ample, more than enough in fact, which makes this place pretty good on the pockets too. Infact we still had to pack away some of the food despite 4 of us being there. And that packing was prompt on their part. So I'd recommend this place on any regular day but I will NOT speak for festive days. The warning given above should cover for that ;)

The first impression about the restaurant is that its quite big. It has two floors and it can handle a lot of customers. We had some chinese dishes here and the menu card had a wide range of other dishes to offer as well. The most irritating thing of this restaurant is their Service. Neither the Waiter was well behaved neither the person taking thr order. Not only with us, they were casual as well with other people too. My fork fell down accidentally and had to wait a long time for the waiter to come and clean it. And another 2-3mins time were taken for them to provide me a new one. Allover without that thing all were well. Giving a low rating for their service.

Nothing but only praising in superlatives can do justice to this place! Undoubtedly, the most pocket friendly restaurant serving extraordinary food in Jadavpur Area!! Situated behind the petrol pump at Sulekha, spread over two floors, with decent ambiance, spectacular service and amazing quality of food, this restaurant has been making people happy from its inception. :D I have been visiting this place since like forever :) :) 

Their Indian and Chinese dishes both are equally good! Among Indian, specially the kababs are worth mentioning! A-class kababs ! I personally just drool over their reshmi kabab! The Butter Masala (Chicken) and the Mutton Rara is amazing as well! 
Among Chinese, all time favorites are -  the THAI CHICKEN (Highly recommended!! ).... the HUNAN CHICKEN (Their specialty!!)...... the PAN FRIED CHICKEN (amazing as starter as well as with rice)....... the CHICKEN IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE (one of my Favorite!!).......the CARIBBEAN DRUMSTICK (crispy fried drumsticks juicy inside and spicy outside!!).  They are generous with the portions as well. One bowl of Fried Rice/Noodles can serve 2 persons easily!  

Ambiance as mentioned before is pretty decent with spacious dining area spread over two floors! Waiters are cordial and polite. 

Each time a delightful experience with a happy tummy and a happier wallet! ;) !!

Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5

Tucked behind the petrol pump opposite Sukanta Setu is this place, all decked up in freed and cream - a clean and simple place with no frills. 
It is one of those non-specialised 'multi-cuisine air-conditioned' restaurants which used to be the most prevalent species even half a decade back. It serves North-Indian and Indian-Chinese. 
I was craving for some tandoori chicken and polished off one full juicy chicken in a matter of minutes. I was very happy with what I got, and also the prices ate very reasonable. 
But just one glitch - this was around 8.30 pm when the people at another table were told that they had run out of all sorts of biriyani.

Jadavpur’s Calcutta Bistro is a place which offers excellent food and good servicing. The food items are no doubt delicious; take their prawn tempura which is simply yummy, or fish mofato or chicken pan fried momo or crispy chili baby corn, these are truly flavorous. Among the soup I like Thai chicken soup and kebabs which will be must are fish tikka and murg lasuni tikka. On the main course vegetarian are chili potato, chili garlic vegetable, paneer sauce of your choice, chili paneer and many others. And my favourite is vegetable Manchurian and sweet and n sour paneer. Sometimes when I want to try non veg, I prefer their chili prawn or kung pao prawn or garlic prawn. I always prefer rice so I order schezwan fried rice or egg wrap fried rice. For change I sometimes I prefer their mutton shahi biriyani or chicken shahi biriyani. The other day, when I was in the restaurant with my cousin sister she ordered chili garlic noodles which was fabulous. The restaurant also has non veg food items, nun roti etc. with that there is salads items raita and green salads.

And it was my bestie Tanwyee Ray 's birthday.  We had to decide for some great place where we could hog soulfully for a Christmas lunch. Of course park street had to be avoided. So finally the great great zomato made me search for this one. And we managed to creep in. We had called earlier to reserve the table . But they denied to take in the phone reservation. And finally we landed there. Just near sulekha. And there it was. Loads of people waiting for their turn to arrive. And then after a long wait of 1 hour, the turn finally came and the five of us just hurled in. The restaurant was small and crowded. Since it was Christmas, the tree, the santa and mistletoe hung all over. The ambience appeared joyous. What was missing was music. Then of course hurling and eager to serve us the staff took the order all at once. The starter was simple buttered prawn and pan fried chilli chicken. It tasted amazing and I would recommend this for people who love prawns. Then of course came the time the main course. We simply stuck to mixed hakka noodles and chilli garlic noodles. To team it up we did kung pao chicken and stir fried chicken and mushroom in oyster sauce. All the preparations were amazingly mouth watering. However a special mention of the kung pao chicken and chilli garlic noodles is a must as the delicious taste still persists. and the dessert was of course the birthday cake that they courteously let us cut. I will definitely wanna come back with Arindam Dey  @tanwyee and Swarnabi Pal again. A highly recommended restro for all those who crave for chinos.

My expectations were high due to its general popularity but I am not thoroughly impressed by this place.

Food: Quantity more than sufficient and quality very good. The noodles and chicken items are pretty tasty. However, there is very less option for vegetarians. They completely belittled the tree-huggers by keeping utterly basic, boring and less number of items. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: It's a pretty small place with basic decor and soothing lighting. It has very less number of seats so most of the time you would need to wait a considerable time outside the restro before you can get a seat. Sofas are comfortable. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: If you are going there for dine in, you will b treated well but if you want a take away then the staff genuinely loses interest on you to the extent of ignoring you or making you feel insulted. Speed is moderate. I rate it 2.5/5.

Overall, I give it 3/5.

Having gone here numerous times I have no problems in vouching for this restaurant! Quality food and more than adequate quantity for a foodie like me at a pretty reasonable price makes this place one of my favorites!  The waiters are usually pretty friendly with good recommendations. Interiors are nice, especially on the 2nd floor. One of the best things I've had here is the Honey Glazed Chicken and its sweet after taste is unusual and yummy all at the same time! the only downside is that sometimes the service times are not what you would call optimal but when you are with a bunch of your friends it really doesn't matter too much!

I had to wait 40 minutes to enter the resturant so  I was expecting great food.  The staff did not have enough experience to handle the pouring crowd, the tables were not cleaned properly the mats and the plates were disorganised. When the food arrived I was disappointed, there wasn't much visual Beauty to it. It was all just stuffed in bowls. The taste wasn't that great but it was okay according to the price. There's so much demand of the restaurant is mainly because of the low price, but I don't think that the food was worth waiting 40 minutes. @malasen

CALCUTTA BISTRO..Though located in a very popular, crowded and interesting part of the city which befriends several other good food heaven, what sets the location of Bistro apart from the others is the quaint alley which welcomes its visitors. The ambiance of the place is very soothing, the seats, the tables no one can complain. Now the main part..the food..Oh My God..My taste buds were dancing in joy and at the same time it did not burn a hole in my pocket!!What else can I ask for? Our order included Tandori roti and Kadai chicken. The rotis exhibited a soft melt in mouth taste whereas the chicken was spicy and succulent..the gravy was yummy! One plate consisted of 6 chicken pieces..The staff were very attentive to the customer requirements and a person keeps continuous vigilance to make sure nothing goes wrong...So if you care about your hard earned money and want good value for it definitely eat out here...whether on a date, family gathering, hangout with friends or arrange a small official meeting.. CALCUTTA BISTRO would not let you down!!

P.S: Though I initially planned on taking the picture of the food..ultimately when it arrived I gorged on it and forgot everything else!! :-P

Yesterday me and my wife visited there for a dinner and ordered Mixed Fried rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Crispy Fish . Although this was our first visit to Calcutta Bistro but we are happy to be there. Ambiance was good  and courteous.
Both quantity and quality of food was enjoyable. But only one thing, delivery time was too long !!We ordered at 9:15 pm and got the food around 9:50pm !! others were also facing the same problem.
Definitely I will visit again ,but, only concern is waiting period.

Calcutta Bistro is one of my favourite restaurants. It's located just behind the Sulekha petrol pump, jadavpur. The food tastes really awesome. I have tasted navratna polao and balti chicken and they have become my hot favourites. The ambience is good, nothing extraordinary and the price is very reasonable. Will love to visit it again.

Located just opposite side of sukanta setu, behind the Petrol Pump. Nice Ambiance, staff's and service is quite good. But takes little more time to serve after getting the order. Food quality is good and tastes well. Most important No Tax on billing.

Pathetic, I'll never go back there. Lousy staff. Appeared to be friendly to only the ones they know. Kept us waiting to take the order. We ordered a dish of veg rice, they brought us a chicken one. We waited for another 20 mins for the rice to be served while the other side dishes awaited in the table to be eaten cold. We also ordered an Arabian prawn salt and pepper to be packed, they gave us something which looked like a version of chilly garlic prawn. I will never go back there.

Not very difficult to find thanks to the signboard on the main road.
Nice place with a nice ambience and decor.
The food is served quickly,but the waiters don't serve at all,so don't pay much tips I suggest. 
The food is good in both taste and quality,although some descriptions provided on the menu were misleading. For e.g. the Three Firecracker Chicken was supposed to be really spicy,but wasn't.
The good thing bout the menu is that it shows the final price of the dishes,hence making it easy to calculate your expenditure before hand.
In all,a nice place.

Well,this place had made its position and name between my peers and acquaintances very fast. One of my friends suggested i should try this place once and i won't be disappointed,and i should thank him for his suggestion to me for trying this place out. Truly speaking,this place has ambience that would attract families as well as couples. Dimly lit,roses on the tables and neatly placed mats on the tables,i loved its ambience. Now coming to hospitality,they are always very much welcoming and hospitable to their customers,not only for taking your orders and serving them but also for other stuff that you ask them to do they would always be at you service with a huge smile on their faces. Now about food,if you want to try out really tasty and awesome food of great quality and equally great quantity then this is your place. Do taste their lung fung soup,the lovely egg on top along with chicken,prawn and with a flavour of lemon will take you taste buds outside the world. Other chinese items on their menu are equally delicious. Over all,a great joint to hang out with friends as well as family.

Well , i got many opinions about this restaurant. Its too far from our place. When we reached there, ahuge line was there. Bt fortuanately we didn't had to wait for too long. Ambiance was ok typs. We ordered fish mofato, and paper chicken as starter. Paper chicken was not that good. Bt fish mofato was very delicious. Then we ordered parsi mutton curry, masala naan, chicken biriyani , singapore noodles and another chicken dish. The parsi mutton curry and masala naan and biriyani was awesome, but Chinese foods were average. I wd suggest to hav indian foods here. U must try the parsi mutton curry and masala naan and the fish mofato...

One thing i must say about the service they provide, was good, bt they at 1st didn't serve the onion and pickle for indian food. I was a bit disappointed at this. Other wise this was a good experience....

This is a pretty mediocre restaurant which serves average food. Chinese dishes and biriyani both are of average quality. They don't even know how to make schezwan fried rice and behaviour of their staff is not acceptable. People generally like this place because of their low price as they don't apply any tax.

I had brought my family and friends over here on different occasions and have been given a sloppy and mediocre service, servers were not bothered with us, the food was uninspired and mediocre at its best. The manager himself was not in a position to help us when needed. No upselling or push for sales was there.. Thank God! But it was as if they didn't care 
at all! They also couldn't describe a few dishes of their own menu, which I guess speaks a lot for the service. The food is priced suitably for its quality. Only come here if you want to treat those pesky friends or family members without hurting your budget.

Ordered home delivery last evening.
I was promised delivery with one hour, but by the time the food arrived more than two hours had passed since I'd placed the order.
On top of that no one was answering the phone, I'm highly unimpressed with this kind of service.
 Food was good, no complaints about that but it had gone cold by the time it reached me.
Hoping for a better experience next time.

When the fault lines in your family run deep on whether to try chinese or indian then Calcutta bistro is the place to be. Simply avoid dining out at this place on weekends and holidays because of its unnerving popularity! They dont take reservations on weekends and that adds to the chaos. We went there for a saturday dinner and the place looked like a fairground at 8 and the waiting crowd hadn't thinned when we left at 10! To top it all the man at the gates was rude!
The decor of the place is nothing special and pillars at odd places make seating difficult at some tables. The tables are also extremely close to each other. Privacy on your conversation is not an option here.
Coming to the food we ordered a mixed tom yum soup, chiken reshmi kebab, biryani, egg noodles, a chiken tikka butter masala, moon fun rice, a chinese prawn dish and one chicken dish. The soup was pretty good. So were the noodles. The chicken tikka butter masala was delicious. Nice and creamy with generous soft chicken. The moon fun rice was downright horrible! The chicken and prawn dishes were decent but nothing special. Some items like mein foon, black bean sauce and mushroom items were not available.
The portions are generous and the prices will keep you happy. The service of the waiters is fast and courteous. Nice to see that. 
Overall a decent place to dine out if its not the weekend. The food will satisfy you but won't elate you. Home delivery is a much better option i guess.

It was a sort of great disappointment for us when tasted the home delivered food from here in lunch. My in-laws uncle and aunt who are the residents of US had come over to India in a short visit and wanted to host a family get together at home.
After going through the reviews we had grown a very positive idea about food taste and quality and the persons here about their hospitality.We were to order for about 26 heads and we visited the restaurant , a day before to book the order.We requested for some suggestions but the persons present there were not so warm and took the order in a very casual manner and as suggested by them almost all the dishes tasted the same(though we asked the dishes should taste different from each other) . We do not know if their chef was in a hurry , as we asked the delivery to be done by 1 pm.
We ordered for Kung Pao Chicken and Chillie fish, both almost tasted the same.However there was no compromise on quantity-it was enough for  26 heads.

A nice and cheap place to hang out with friends or family. The waiters are really well mannered and take good care of you. Located a little away from the rush of Jadavpur 8B bus terminus, it has a calm and quiet surrounding.

I like the Biriyani which they served and the chines starters.  I must say that the paneer which they served under the veg main course was unique. 

The first floor of the restaurant is well decorated but the ground floor looks a bit off as the kitchen door, the counter as well as the stairs are all situated at the wall which is directly facing the door.

I came to know about this restaurant through zomato."Pocket friendly" and great food is like your dream combo in student life.

The Ambiance was soothing.
The Staff were polite and helpful.
Now lets talk about the food
So far All the items I tasted over the two visits along my friends had been memorable.

Murgh Tikka-Typical tikka kabab with perfect blend of spices and almost as soft as malai kabab.Must Try.

Chicken Tandoori-It was also really tasty but not as soft as tikka.

Drunken Noodles-It was suggested by the staff. Pasta style noodles apparently cooked with less spice and less oil yet having a smooth chilly flavour.Quite a surprise.

Chilli Garlic Noodles- It was really a spicy bit of amazing noodles.If you love spices it will instantly become your favourite.

Kung Pao Chicken- I heard about this item a lot over zomato.So decided to have a go and it was a great success.
The curry had a special blend of sauces and spices,really different in taste.

Firecracker Chicken- Its a purely spicy and chilly item,if you love spicy things you will love this by your heart but if not then you will regret your order.

Pan Fried Chilli Chicken- This item was a gem.Awesome to have as a starter or with rice.Must Try.

Kadhai Chicken- Typical spicy Indian style gravy dish.goes well with nun.

 
#P.S.- The Sweet Lime Soda serves as a awesome sidekick to all these superheros.

*** The second time i visited the place,we had to wait a long time for the food to come.Hope that doesn't happen often.

Bistro, i would say is a wrong name for this joint. Everything about this place was avarage , but the egg wrapped fried rice prompted me to give a 3.5 rating. It was tasty and the portion size was good. Tempura prawns were okayish.. The fish manchurian we ordered was horrible.. After having a piece each, we didnot touch the dish.

Went there for having dinner with my cousins. At first the place was a bit crowded and we had to wait for 15mins but that was not an issue. Now the food part, I probably had the best Chicken tikka butter masala I have had ever! It was so delicious and the chicken pieces were also very soft. Bur that was it. The Chinese dishes I ordered wasn't that good and I was very disappointed. I forced one of my cousin to have the kungpao chicken which I had before and was disappointed with the one I got here. Did not meet my level of expectation. Even the fresh lime soda felt more like cold water rather than, well fresh lime soda! Overall it was fine, not something I will remember for a long time.

Check out Pan Fried noodles here.
Its just in a odd place otherwise the food deserves a visit.

When you are low on cash but friends are asking for a treat,visit here...Must say very pocket friendly,and I also must say come here only friends...Not a family place...Staffs are ok not very professional...Ambience is also ok...Place is right near sukanta setu,stoppage name is sulekha...My favorite dish here is kung pao chicken...Chefs are very good at Chinese food...Recommend place to visit...

If cheap food n wholesome quantity is what you are seeking, you may proceed to this restaurant.  It was a scorching summer of May when I took refuge to this AC restaurant.  I was taken for a ride by the name n outer appearance of the restaurant.  I ordered gravy chowmein. What came for me was a shock. Red gravy chowmein???
U think they had experiented all spices except Keora water (used in Biryani) in this dish. Wat hopeless!!!
Strict NO NO for repeat visit.

A really good place to have food....very very tasty food, affordable and a good location (Jadavpur). I had been here twice and both times, I had loved the food. We had ordered tandoori naan, chicken and paneer--all the dishes were equally yummy.  5/5 for ambiance--clean, prim and proper. Serving and staff behaviour-really co-operative. I would really recommend people to visit this place if you really wanna have good food within your budget.

Visited here twice bt experience was nt good in both the cases.....1stly the waiters seems to be in a hurry always and wanted us to give orders right away..then the food was of inferior quality..we had a tough time having crispy chicken it ws soo stiff...noodles were half boiled... we ordered cantonese gravy noodles..n the gravy was jst confined to the top layer of the bowl in which it ws served n the bottom had stiff half boiled noodles..side dishes were also very degraded speacly the chiken ws stiff...the price r cheap bt the food  is not satisfactory

Went there with friends for snack on a evening. So we ordered Pan Fried Chicken and Lung Fung Soup. Soup was decent and kinda like Thai Soup and the taste of the Pan Fried Chicken was awesome. The Chicken was like melting in my mouth and i was kinda like WOW! What the Hack is this!? Love to visit there again..

I am a regular visitor to this restaurant since its initial days and it feels awesome to review this place.

The ambiance,the hygienic condition and the staff score extra points for being such a wonderful place to dine-out.

What do I say about their food...be it their Chinese dishes or North Indian cuisine..they excel equally in both. Everytime I visit I make sure to try their varieties of soups and starters mainly almond chicken in lemon honey sauce and kung pao chicken. In the main course my favorites are hong kong and mongolian fried rice,cantonese noodles and Bistro's special Mei foon.
Indian dishes like prawn lababdar,malabar prawn curry,karai paneer,kadhai chicken,chicken do pyaza,navratan polao and masala kulcha are a must try.

Went there again recently with a friend..the menu has changed a bit. Had balti prawn,masala kulcha,general Tso's chicken and blue sky. As a starter the Tso's chicken was a bit overcooked and full of soya sauce,so didn't like it much. Balti prawn and kulcha were awesome. Blue sky was a refreshing drink. Extra Browny points to the management for introducing the student loyalty card.

Hot and Sour soup - 4.5/5
Pan Fried Fish - Awesome. Must have. (4.8/5)
Drumstick - Awesome again.(4.7/5)Chicken Biriyani - It is a bengali style biriyani with potato and egg. It tastes great. Quantity is more then enough for a person.(4.5/5)
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala - My favorite dish. Though the taste is not the same as it tasted the first & second time,it has deteriorated.(4.8/5)
Balti Chicken - Good One. Comes in a small balti ;) . Indian dish with spices and capsicum,tomato.(3.8/5)
Chicken Tikka Masala - Great in taste. It goes great with palau. (4.5/5)
Mutton Do Piaza - Mutton Pieces were average. The dish tasted yummy. (4/5)Masala Khulcha and Butter Tandoori Roti - 4.5/5Kung pao Chicken - Good (3.7/5)Hong Kong Fried Rice - Comes with an omelet. More than enough for 2 person. Tastes really good(4.2/5)Navaratna and Peas Pulao - Good(3.7/5) Nice ambiance. Great place for family and friends.

Tucked away in a nondescript corner of Jadavpur, this place is clearly a students' hangout because of its cheap prices. But, the service is very slow and the food is nothing extraordinary.  The tandoori rotis were served cold, but the naan was good enough. Spare your pocket, and don't order any dessert. Try to avoid the soup section too! Stick to the main course and you won't regret it!

A decent place in the Jadavpur locality to have your meal.. very popular among families and the young crowd.. The chinese is better than the Indian.. on my last visit to Kolkata I went there along with a friend of mine.. We ordered 2 fresh lime soda,1 prawn pepper salt,1 chicken fried rice and 1 thai chicken.. All the items were good except the Thai chicken .. it was way toooooo sweet as per our taste.. The plus point of this place is the quantity they serve which is HUGE!! .. we couldnt finish off our food and had to parcel it.. A reasonably good place for dine in..

The restaurant is very polular among the locals in the area and people from other parts of the city. Primarily known for its chinese foods it also serves north indian dishes. Every time I visited there I tried the chinese dishes. 
Must Try Carabian Drum Sticks Mongolian Rice
Kum Pao Chicken
Rice Noodles
The quantity is good and most interestingly they dont charge VAT.

Only a few minutes walk from my place, Calcutta Bistro is a nice place to be in. The Thai Chicken soup (which I tasted on my maiden visit) is pleasing and light. The Mutton Biryani (I felt) is slightly overpriced since one can get a little more (quantity-wise) at Rs 140. The kebabs are lip-smacking and when seasoned with lime and savoured with peppermint sauce, one would start craving for more pieces. However, the flip side of the coin is that, upon my latest visit, the dishes, ordered by a group sitting quite close to where I was, contained some bits of hair in them..!!! Though It is not my job, suggesting on how the cooking staffs should be careful with their kitchen chores, but if such an incident is repeated, then, I'm afraid, Calcutta Bistro would find it hard to maintain the reputation it had earned for itself over the years. :(

After reading about this place in Zomato I decided to give it a try. The place is inside an alleyway near Jadavpur. The ambience was quite good. We went there at around 5 30 pm and were quite surprised to find it nearly full. We ordered the Crispy Chicken Konjee, Hong Kong Fried Rice and the Hunan Chicken. The Chicken Konjee was a disappointment. It was very dry and salty. The quantity of the rice was, however, huge and it tasted amazing as well. Hunan Chicken was again, a bit salty, but I liked the taste. Service was very slow. It was pocket friendly though, with each of the items coming under a 100 bucks.

Calcutta Bistro, quietly hidden behind the Sulekha petrol pump station was our choice for brunch on the first day of the Bengali New year. As was expected of the day, the place was totally filled up and after having to wait for a few minutes; we finally secured a table upstairs. The décor of the restaurant is neat and fuss free, not at all made for attracting attention.
We had firstly planned to order the buttered noodles but its unavailability made us opt for the safe and sound Chilli Garlic Noodles instead, along with the Firecracker Chicken (we were feeling a bit adventurous). While the noodles were packed with a delicious crunch of fresh julienne veggies, chicken and a much loved hit of garlic, the firecracker chicken was a total disappointment. It was a bowl of boneless chicken chunks in a sauce of thick extremely sweet tomato ketchup, having nothing firecracker-y about it.  We were finally forced to fork up the 8 chicken pieces and totally avoided the gravy.
Nevertheless, the helpings were very generous and the bill quite affordable. Even though some of the staff members were a bit muddled up while taking our orders (owing to the rush maybe), they’re pretty polite otherwise.
Overall, it is a good place for a budget meal, if you stick to the tried and tested dishes.

Not to keen to visit again.

Situated right behind the petrol pump at SULEKHA, this place serves amazing food at a reasonable price. the staff is well mannered and polite but the service could be faster. I am absolutely in love with their panfried chicken and singapore noodles. The quantity of the food is ample. If one's in south calcutta and does not feel like spending too much or travelling to far, this place is definitely a good option. :)

Having hearing of this one for quite a long time now from my friends in Jadavpur , i finally decided to pay a visit yesterday night only .... :) .... though not situated exactly beside the main road like Red chopstix or Golden Gate (which are just nearby but on the opposite side of the street) , have to enter into a narrow lane by the side of the petrol pump .......

After waiting outside for approx 20min. , we got our turn to enter inside ....... the space inside is quite less ...... ambience not that great .....its manageable i should say ...... behaviour of staff is ok i should say .....neither very courteous nor rude ,infact its  inconsistent depending on their mood i guess :) ....the security guard who was outside managing the queue , initially wasn't so polite in his behaviour with us (though not definitely rude) ,but later on after we had entered and taken our food, his behaviour was noticeably different ,i couldn't make out why .....!!

Newayzz ....coming to the main aspect ..... .the food ..... We ordered Crispy konjee chicken and caribbean drumstick .....crispy konjee chicken was a disappointment ,especially considering the same item being served in Tandoor Park (which is also in jadabpur) ........ Caribbean drumstick was good .....almost the same in taste as u would find in Golden Gate ....but with quite a lesser price ..... For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice .....quantity was really good .... 2 plates of it would easily suffice 3 people on an avg ...... (and if u r a big foodie, i plate would be sufficiently enough for you as it was for me ) .....tastewise it was good too ...... the hunan chicken was also nice...... the gravy was thick ..... a little extra (gravy) would have been more appreciable :)

The main USP of Calcutta Bistro is its PRICE ...... nowadays overall tax stretches the total bill by almost 20%+  on food ...... here not only are the prices of items are quite less than its counterparts nearby (like Red Chopstix ,Golden Gate,etc) , but also the prices mentioned are INCLUSIVE OF TAXES ,which makes the total bill even lesser ...... so i would definitely recommend it ....



Ambience : Not very spacious ,not great but manageable

Food : Standard ...quite good

Value for money : Definitely YES

A place where I often visit for dinner with my family, the only down side is that you have to wait for your seat at rush hour.

I love the fact that they provide a very good quantity of food, almost everything i have ordered till now, every time I visited this place, tastes very good. And I have been to this restaurant atleast 8 times ,if not more.
The ambience is good , and since they have no bar it is good place to go with family.  The behavior of the staff is also pleasant.

All in all  good food, nice quantity and reasonable price.

Reasonable price and tasty food. Decor not too good. Kind of slightly uncomfortable sitting. Service may be late sometimes. I liked the hunan chicken. Price is in fact justified. Ambience nothing special. The location is quite nice given it's not directly in front of the main road. Waiting in the alley doesn't hurt much given it's quiet and not too hot during the day or not raining.

Few years back when I visited this place for the first time, Calcutta Bistro used to be favourite for many of us. Since then, the quality of food has gone down according to me.
They serve both Chinese and Indian, but Chinese items are better. Kung pao chicken is still tastes really very delicious.
The quantity that they serve is more than enough for a single person. Another good thing about them is - it is a pocket friendly place.
Ambience is nice and staffs are pretty cautious.

The very first thing you notice about this restaurant is the cutlery...they serve you in a warm plate.. thats what adds to its charm!
    A delightful eatery with warm interiors and good ambience. It is spread across two floors. But the service on the first floor is better than the service on the ground floor.
    The food quality is good and the quantity makes it easier on the pocket.
      Of all the dishes i've tried, right from starters to main course, barring a few like prawn malabar curry, sweet and sour chicken and garlic naan, all have been worth eating and paying for.
    All said and done, be your best judge and if you want to enjoy a soulful meal, this is the place you should definitely give a try.

The food is delicious & the ambience is quite striking!! Serving is quick & the most surprising thing is that there's no hassle for any heavy VAT!! When I visited the first time I tried Special Meifoon (rice noodles) with Thai Chicken  which was heavenly!! They also have a vast platter of starters among whcih murgh tengri kebab is a must try! Yesterday I tried Mixed Fried Rice with Firecracker Chicken which was 'hatke' & completely new to my taste buds...all this was washed down with a sumputuous glass of virgin mojito!! u can also try their Cold Coffee which is quite up to the mark!! All in all a tremendously satisfying experience & an excellent place where you can hang out with your buddies without burning a deep hole in your pockets!!

So we decided to go to Calcutta Bistro after zomato-ing it.
We reached around 12:30. The place is difficult to locate.
Anyway, we found the restaurant to be empty and we were seated in the second floor.
The waiter who was attending us, was not very well trained.
He was'nt giving us much attention, maybe thinking that we kids ( according to him) wont give him good tips.:/

Coming to the food now.
Since it was a new place, we went for dishes which are quite safe for a first visit

Food we ordered.

1) Chicken Reshmi Kebab : Soft pieces of chicken marinated and grilled to perfection. Very nice.

2) Fish Tikka : Tasty but I found it to be salty for my palate whereas others found it fine.

3) Chicken Gravy Chowmein : Quantity was huge. Tastd amazing. Had huge amount of chicken pieces.

4) Chicken Manchurian : Had a slightly sweet taste and was hot too. Good.

5) Chilli Fish : Tasted normal.

6) Stuffed Kulcha : Served hot with butter. The stuffing was amazing. Tasted amazing.

7) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala : Decent.

8) Fish Banjara : Pretty nice. Liked it. :)

9) Fresh lime soda : Good.

10) Chocolate Sundea : It was just chocolate icecream.

11) Strawberry Sundea : Again. Strawberry icecream.

12) Tutti Fruity : Three scoops of Icecream with fruits (canned). Refreshing.

13) Caramel Custard : The quality was good. I did not expect such a fantastic taste. Very nice.

Pocket pinch was around 3000 bucks.
I would have given a 4/5 rating but I have deducted 0.5 because of the waiter who was attending us. :)

RECOMMENDED. :D

Go there only for the Stir Fried Chicken & Broccoli in Oyster Sauce and make sure to have it with the Chilli Garlic Noodles or any of the other varieties of fried rice, but not their Singapore Fried Rice since it came as a disappointment and so did the Kung Pao Chicken. I wouldn't recommend having the Tutti Frutti Ice Cream either as it was devoid of canned pineapples, and shouldn't have had chocolate ice-cream. I'd give this place 3.5 only for the Chicken in Oyster Sauce which I quite liked.

A pocket friendly place that provided average quality food. Had ordered the delivery once and have dined in once. Restro decor is nothing special although quite clean and bright. I liked the Chinese fare much better than the Indian. Chili Garlic Noodle was really tasty. So was the Singapore Fried rice. Tandoori Chicken is average and a bit bland. Chicken tikka butter masala was in the sweeter side and nothing extraordinary. 
My recommendation would be Chinese food from this place as the quantities are huge and tastes quite good.

This place is by far my most frequently visited place. The best thing abt calcutta bistro is it is pocket friendly and the food is also awesome. The menu is long and consists of different cuisines. The quality nd quantity of the food served is the best. 
Overall
Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5

Some of their best dishes are the usual ones like the manchurian, or say the Singapore fried rice or even the chckn in black bean sauce. The biriyani is also good although not the best. But ths place shud get best rating bcoz of the quality nd quantity of the food they provide at tht rate.

Tucked away behind a Gas station right, this place is easy to miss, but due to its enormous popularity in the locality of Jadavpur University, there will always be someone to point it out to you. 
The reason for it's popularity is obvious: cheap, great food and in HUGE portions too. 
Both it's continental and Indian fare is good, even if nothing besides their kebabs stand out at par excellence. 

Servers are courteous. The interior modest. The seats comfortable. The pocket pinch, very little.

Calcutta Bistro was on my food-list for a very long time, as its close to my home.

Some days back, me and my friends were returning from our ex school's fest.
As usual tired of meeting all the friends after so long and the endless chats we 5 decided to go grab some food here.

Its located in a very easy to find place so we all just hopped in there. :3
Things we ordered were - Paneer Makhni, Butter Naan,
                                                Chinese Chopsuey, Fried Rice and Chicken Makhni.

Paneer Makhni was okayish.
Chinese Chopsuey was good.

But the Chicken Makhni just stole my heart away!
It was amazing.

And that is why I'd love to go there again!

As they say all good things are hard to find, so is the case with this Restaurant.
The restaurant is located in a narrow alley adjoining the Petrol Pump near Sulekha Jadavpur. 

Ambience : Average decor, calm neighbourhood with  nice instrumental music in the background.

Food : Good quality with ample Quantity (Every serving is good enough for 2) and Reasonable Price sums it up for Bistro. Starters : Caribbean Drumsticks is my favourite here.
Main Course : Singapore Fried Rice with Chicken with Brocolli in Oyster Sauce is a delight, so are the regular Chinese dishes. 
Havnt tried the Indian dishes yet.

Service : Well mannered and courteous staff who know their food and sauce. 

USP : All rates displayed  on the menu are INCLUSIVE OF ALL TAXES, that's the best part of the deal. Highly economic for the kind of food they serve.

Highly recommended for Youngsters with limited Pocket money and Bachelors looking for an economic eating option as well as for big family outings.

Reasonably Priced , Hygienic , Perfect Ambiance and Awesome Serving Staff. Food is actually good. Pepper Fish , Prawn Arabian Salt and Pepper, Kung Pao Chicken are my favourite. The point is taste doesnot vary from time to time. Its constant and I like that. Fish Tikka and Murg Reshmi Kebabs are wonderful. Try this place :) :)

I went there several times to this restaurant which is situated just at the back of Sulekha Petrol Pump. This is place is not easy to find for  person who is not aware of this place well. This is the perfect place to give any kind of treats if you have a low budget .
The ambiance is average , you can not just say its below the quality or extra ordinary its just average. They always ask you to go upstairs if the place is empty but nothing special is there! 
Coming to the food quality and quantity , they used to serve good food with adequate quantity with a decent price, they never charge extra taxes on the menu. I have tried most of their Chinese items which used to be quite good with the price and quantity and quality served. But on a recent visit I found that they serve 65-70% of the quantity they used to serve before. Taste  has deteriorated and prices have gone up.  Would not like to visit again (  on my own money) but if its a treat have to :P

I had visited this place long ago with my friends.I had found nothing special over there so kept a safe distance from it for a long time.but yesterday after so much positive reviews in zomato,I decided to try it once more.and omg I regretted every moment that I have missed to come here.the food was awsome.it talks about quality quality and quality. Me with my gf ordered fish mofato,veg fried rice,non veg schezwan friend rice with schezwan chiken.
And we loved the most-
1. The fish mofato(the taste haven't gone from my buds yet)- listened so much about this dish,finally had the chance to taste it..I can come over here every week for this perticular dish.
2.the quantity and quality of the foods.
3.the behavior to the customers.its a very important point for me in any restaurant.and they have recruited so many well behaved men..
Waiting To go there soon :-)

this was my second visit here. took chicken kebab full, kulcha, badshahi chicken, chicken kadai. All dishes were avg. Didnt like the chicken kadai taste that much.it was somewhat good. kulcha was good and badsahi chicken was nice. chicken kebab was something that i like among these items. total was around 900/-.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Visit :
situated in sulekha calcutta bistro is near to my house in santoshpur.Today went for dinner there..As we entered the ground floor was empty.There was no one.We were told to go upstairs..It was a good place.ambience was good.It was neat and clean.
After a small discussion with my friend we deccided to go for OUT OF CONTROL as mocktail, PAN FRIED  CHICKEN as starters and STIR FRIED CHICKEN WITH OYSTER SAUCE and CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES as main course.Thw waiters were good and well mannered.The mocktail was good.It was kind of mango juice with hajmola mixed with an essence of cilli.whatever but it tasted good.Then they took a bit more time then they should actually take.after  around 20 minutes the starters cames.it was nyc and spicy.What i think is that hadit been more crispy than chewy it would have tasted a bit better.A bit more time , den we were served the main course.main course was throught nice.liked ot.the noodles was enough for 2 persons.all dese costed me Rs 580/- which was ok for me.
overall a pleasant visit.overall a good restuarant.liked it.next time will try the north indian dishes here.

i was omg so very unimpressed when i first ventured inside with a friend .. the petrol pump bang in front of the resto, the queer *galli* which leads to it looked so meh..once inside, the decor was quite clean but nothing out of the ordinary! typically done up in red and white, i had almost no expectations and was just regretting coming here when my chicken in oyster sauce and pan fried noodles arrived and i was :O :O the amount was awesome and the food smelled so authentic..and with the very first bite, i was a fan!! the noodles were neither too soggy nor too hard, fried just perfectly and had a lot of chicken and veggies going on in the plate..it took us quite a bit to polish the meal off and the bill made us cry *in happiness*..the staff is nice and polite, the ambiance is nice and the prices are mwahh..the next time we ordered tandoori chicken and the lachha onions, the pudina chutney were the perfect foil to the moist, tender, soooo juicy tandoori <3 i loved it more than i love my arsalaan tandoori *yes i am in my right state of mind* and thats saying something! the price was marvellous and we hogged like ogres :P waiting to rush over ASAP again!!

Went to the restaurant for a friend's birthday party...  Firstly,the staff was very polite and good.(we bought a cake from a nearby pastry shop,the manager of the restaurant allowed us to cut the cake inside the restaurant)
secondly,the ambience was also good(3.5/5). coming to the food, we ordered mixed fried rice,thai chicken,naan,badshahi kaju chicken. truely speaking,the food was delicious,and quantity was also very good.
only con is that,the food takes long time to arrive after ordering.
would love to visit this place again....

Are you planning to order food on a weekend? No please don't place an order here. They take a lifetime to arrive and half of the time they don't respond. The mutton biriyani that i ordered was kind of ok. I didn't dislike. The side dish chicken tikka butter masala was yummy. So i would say i may try their food again and definitely i would recommend an inside the restaurant order.

This one is a special place for me!! Had a lot of hangouts with my colleagues and friends. The amazing thing is the quality and quantity calcutta bistro manage compared to their pricing. Ambiance is ok though a bit space crunch is there. In decor is average but I strongly believe a restaurant is as good as its food is. My recommendations are fish mofato as starter, followed by     mongolian rice or singapore fried rice. If u are a noodles buddy I dont think this a place for u. Chicken dishes are average. Most importantly they serve a choice of north indian dishes including a delicious pulao tossed with fruits. Dont forget to grab a bite of balti chicken or mutton rara masala. Amazingly the chinese dishes are more than enough in quantity and the quality is decent too. If u r planning to throw a bunch of gluttons a party with a flat purse this is the place for u. have a try.

visited this place with my family. The ambience is soothing. The waiters are very polite. 
food that we ordered:
thai soup: which was tangy in taste with coriander and good quantity of egg and shredded chicken.
mahi tikka: nothing out of the world, could have been better. 
mutton Biriyani: contained two pieces of mutton, an egg and potato. I wasn't pleased with its taste. 
navaratan rice: this was really good.
balti fish: spicy. but the fish wasn't bekti or basa. but it was soft and juicy. 
pineapple sundae: was quite disappointed as they served me vanilla ice cream and some pieces of pineapple with it. They should have served pineapple flavoured ice cream.

We met up after office at a friend's place in Santoshpur. Quite hungry, we searched Zomato for delivery options. Ordering deliveries near Santoshpur is never an issue since the region is flooded with restaurants serving different cuisines. Last evening we zeroed on Calcutta Bistro for some starters since none of us wanted to make ourselves full for the dinners waiting at respective homes. We ordered for a plate of pepper fish and pan fried chilli chicken at about 9.20 p.m. The order (including the locating of the address issue) took about 1 and a half hours to arrive. We waited impatiently and when  it finally did, we jumped on it and finished it to the last bit. In fact, half way through the food did I remember to click pictures of the same (the new point incentive regarding pictures! phew!). 
The delivery did take a quite a bit of time than what I would have expected and here I would rate the Calcutta Bistro delivery service a 2.5.
 I haven't been to the restaurant yet, would reserve my comments about the ambience for another time. The food though was really fresh and tasty. The fish (neither basa nor bhekti, thus not sure what... but it did not stink) was soft, had an absolutely minimal thin cornflour coating and tasted quite spicy yet comforting. The pan fried chilli chicken on the other hand was sweet, a tad too much at that because I literally picked up some chillies from the fish to neutralise the sweetness. Other than  that, the chicken along with the carrots and capsicum fries tasted really good. And more so for the price shed (310 INR). The food gets a 3.5 from me.

Initially it was difficult to locate the place since it is situated in a narrow alley,but we somehow managed to get into it.. It has a pleasant set up,double-tiered arrangement makes it a lil more spacious.. we ordered chicken biriyani,balti chicken along with masala kulcha and butter nan.. Though the prices and some interesting choices made me excited,we all were utterly disappointed with the service.. It took an eternity for them to deliver the stuff and by the time it arrived,half of our hopes were gone.. The kulcha was more like an aaloo paratha while the balti chicken was so so.. But i was really let down by the biriyani,it was a disaster.. The waiters were nice,they switched on the ac when asked(although i expected them to have that sense since it was boiling outside).. The only good thing was the vat free bill which finally brought some smile on our faces... Overall it was an average experience, i wont recommend it,there are far better places in kolkata right now.. stay healthy, good luck..

You can't go wrong with Calcutta Bistro. can you?
Tucked away in a neat corner of Sulekha more in Jadavpur, Calcutta Bistro encompasses pretty much everything a foodie craves for. Order anything, be it Chinese or Indian, and there's little chance you would be disappointed. The double- tiered arrangement helps the restaurant as expectedly, it draws sizeable crowds. The ambience isn't extraordinary, but one would be inclined to accord full marks for cleanliness and hygiene. 
The food, as adumbrated earlier, is unquestionably good. The quantities are more than decent, the taste is commendable & the prices are reasonable by today's standards. The fact that no extra VAT is charged here gives the foodie in you the added impetus to indulge with double the verve. You can also have a large variety of mocktails here, though I am not quite sure whether they serve alcohol. Hardly matters to a teetotaller like me!
Go give it an earnest try& I guarantee you' ll have little room for disappointment.

Me and my friends sorted this place after a prolonged disagreement, maybe its fancy name helped. But this place is difficult to navigate, because it is hidden in an alley way, you would not understand until you step in. Then you have to push back a heavy wooden door to find your way. 

When you step in you would find a limited place, maybe they have upstairs to cater food, but I did not notice it. When we were surfing the menu there were many interesting items that attracted my mind. But a special incident cannot be overlooked, when my veggie friend asked the attendant ‘What it is in Schezwan Paneer? The opposite answered, ‘Paneer’, we laughed our hearts out. But this is not the way you rudely prompt your customers. After that giggling laugh, we have ordered Garlic Chicken, Egg Wrap Fired rice, Hong Kong Fried Rice and Schezwan Panner. When the hot dishes came to our table our appetite had already said ‘Goodbye’ to us. But our grievance had died down when we tasted the food. My veggie was not cheery about his Egg Wrap Fried Rice or even the Paneer, but my non veg dish was savory to consume. 

In Hong Kong fried rice, there were ample amount of meat, egg and prawns were swimming, and Garlic chicken was tender and so mixed with toothsome flavors. The mass of food was quite handsome and mouthful. 

On the terms of service they should be more prompt with orders and service and obviously with politeness. But it is a good place to visit.

Today was my grandmother's birthday and we decided to order home Indian food from Calcutta Bistro. The items were Chicken Reshmi Kebab (4), Paneer Butter Masala (2), Chicken Tikka Masala (2), Yellow Dal and Black Dal (1 each), one mutton biryani and 6 naans. We received our order within 40 minutes of calling, and the food was all piping hot, which was a big plus point. The bill was INR 1718, which was quite reasonable, we thought. The quqntities were really huge and 7 of us ate heartily with plenty of leftovers. The paneer was quite well cooked with a spicy tomato gravy, though there were too few paneer chunks. The kebab was nice and well-cooked, and very filling. The naan, sadly, was very chewy and hard. Still, I understand that packed naans tend to lose their fluffiness. The chicken curry was also okay. 
The most marks go to their promptness in delivery. The food is decent Indian fare, good for a quick inexpensive lunch. I quite liked it.

Quality restaurant in Jadavpur area. Not so costly. Would wanted to rate 4.5. But could not because of one item - Hunan Chicken. The quality of the fish & the taste of the preparation was not upto the mark. But barring that all were good both from quality & quantity standpoint. Special mention of Chili Babycorn & Prawn Red Island. Must try. Last but not the least is the service.  Overall it can be gladly said that Calcutta Bistro is a perfect family restaurant.

As far as services are concerned its very slow and dull...But we cant expect more than that as the prices are too low to demand more.... Hongkong rice, mutton biriyani, fish masala, mint kebab are my fav there....But  normal chinese dishes like fried rie and all are not up to the mark.....

Pepper fish was something that I savored  the most. Their fish was juicy and soft. Same goes for Thai Chicken. The quantity is reasonable but I fund it a bit oily. Mixed fried rice was full of chicken chunks and good quality prawns (because I mostly find small prawns in fried rice in most f the restaurants). Service was also very good. The waiters were friendly and they were visiting time and again to make sure we are enjoying our food. I also happened to notice that they change the table cloth as soon as the table is unoccupied by the people who were having their meals. I was going to rate it 3.5 but for this thoughtful and cleanliness gesture I am giving them an extra .5 marks. So I am rating Calcutta Bistro as 4. Will visit again to try other items.

the only negative point for me is that this place is too far from my house :P 
i went there for a friends bday party and we had to take a long  walk from 8b bus stand 
but the place was worth it 
the restaurant is not on the road which may make it difficult to find for first timers
well coming to the restaurant......... the behaviour of the staff was very satisfying ......they were very responsive and helpful 
they gave us some good suggestions about what to order 
i ordered a kung pao chicken ... i had heard it was good but we didnt like the taste at all 
not sure if the restaurants fault or the dish actually tastes bad :P 
but thats about all the negativity 
the rest was great 
awesome 
the starters ....chicken reshmi kebab  and crispy chili baby corn were really tasty 
the main  course was also a winner for us 
the noodle was great well boiled and well seasoned the veggies were not  over cooked and had a crunch to them just like they should 
the fried rice was equally nice 
the butter naan were soft and the chicken butter masala was very tasty ....i am so eager to try the other dishes ....my friend who is almost a regular customer there speaks of CB with high regards

a pocket friendly place but the i found the place a bit clumsy... I really liked their chinese dishes.. We had manchow soup,crispy chilly babycorn,pan fried noodles, Singapore rice, general tso's chicken, chicken Manchurian... All of them tasted really good... Stuffs were well behaved.. Though I found their service a bit slow.... But overall the experience was quite satisfactory and I will visit the place again :)

I would not say this is a great resturaunt but it is good for a quick hangout with family. We have soup and chinese dishes here. The food quakity was not bad but the kung pao chicken wr have ordered could have been prepared more carefully to reach better taste. Soup and noobles were good. The thing I dislikef is the sitting arrangement and cleanliness. They should not drop the food lrftovers in the floor and re aligned the table cloth when someone is dining in the next table. Otherwise I could give them better rating

I don't rate a restaurant the highest unless the best memory of life is left with it. Eloping to calcutta bistro with Once love of my life and suddenly discovering her dad is on the ground floor too. Even today a bite on the prawn arabian salt and pepper brings a drop of tear to my eyes. 


Coming to the place. It has a beautiful ambiance, subtle, romantic, and a very nice and friendly staff. Parking isn't much of an issue if you are a bit acquainted to the place. 

Coming to the food, people used to the cit cafe based interpretation of modern Chinese food will be knowing what they are having. It's a delicious blend of tang and balance. Starters like the prawn arabian salt and pepper, prawn tempura, crispy konji chicken, drumsticks deserve a special mention, there is that eclectic blend over the starter range. 


I'm a particular fan of the chilli garlic noodles, but other variants are pretty good too. The kung pao chicken is a pick but packs quite a punch. The sesame chicken for the light hearted. Even the chicken /fish with broccoli and oyster sauce is pretty brilliant. All the sides are pretty brilliant. 

I have never been inclined to try Indian food here, just doesn't feel right from cit cafe experiences. The Indian kebabs though are pretty excellent from peer reviews. 

Lastly be sure to visit this place with someone special, you'll have a fond memory that may end up lasting more than the love. Had this place got a decent bar id be a practical resident.

I and a few of my friends happened to visit this place for celebrating birthday. The location is good n at times plays hide and seek behind the petrol pump. But once you cross the alley and reach there its sheer pleasure of food. The staff was helpful as we made preparations for cake and candles. After the ceremony we ordered the food and the quality and quantity both made us happy. We went for mixed fried rice, Thai chicken, Hunan chicken and Szechwan fish. The fish was real thumbs up for me, tender and juicy and spicy. The others were good too. The service was quick and the staff was real helpful.

Would definitely visit it whenever would be in vicinity.

Call  for delivery!
Ambience: No idea! Even after 4-5 meals from Calcutta Bistro, I never actually visited the restaurant! 
Service: Their home delivery service is pretty good. Once I emergency ordered a massive home delivery as late in the night as 10pm, which they served under an hour! Impressive.
Food: I like the Chinese here. Indianised yes, but not overdone. The gravy dishes are not too saucy. The Hakka noodles and Fried rice are flavourful (a bit oily though). The quantities of the mains are very generous and the items are also very reasonably priced!
Recommendation: Do try their Dry Chilli chicken and the Garlic chicken!

C and I were tired after a long journey all the way to a friend's place at Santoshpur, and she was waiting for us after ordering from this place, since Blue Lagoon won't pick up the phone. We got chicken Thai Soup, chilli chicken, pepper fish, pan fried fish, mixed gravy chow mien from them, and the food reached us in one hour or so. This was the only problem with the meal, otherwise, the meal was pretty good. C loved the pan fried fish. I loved the pepper fish and the soup. The gravy chow was all right, although the quantity was big, which was definitely a bonus.  Would love to try out more food from here the next time around.

Calcutta Bistro was recommended to me by a friend of mine a few years back. On my first visit to the place I was quite impressed with the food. You get to choose from a variety of dishes, be it Chinese or Indian delicacies. The second thing that is really a plus point is the quantity. If you have an average appetite then a bowl of any kind of rice will be enough for 2. Prices are quite reasonable, which is good if you're giving a treat to a group of, say, 8-10 people. The place is quite spacious with 2 floors. Hence, vacancy is not really an issue here. The service, at times, is little sloppy, but it's not much of an issue. The ambiance is okay for a group of friends or family. The location of the restaurant is also very strategic, making it easily accessible. All in all, it's a good choice without a doubt.

The food here is really good. Good quality. Good preparations. The thing I like the most here is the Pan Fried Chilli Fish. Because I've never been here personally I can't comment about the sitting arrangements and ambience. But I keep on ordering home deliveries from here. The food takes nearly 45mins to come to South City. The only flaw is that they don't bring change even when they're told to. That annoys a bit. But after having the food you don't think about it anymore. You just love it and melt into it. Overall good food. So I'd recommend the place in aspect of their food quality and taste!

Well, this is my 3rd visit to Bistro and finally I have decided to write something about this new favorite place of mine. Right, Bistro is fast picking up the popularity as it provides very good food at awesome prices.
First thing, Bistro is located behind a petrol pump and you will not see it easily, but I found that there were good number of customers every time I went there. So, that means Bistro has made a mark here.
Why not? The food is simply too good here. I have tried Chinese dishes all the 3 times, and I hope that their Indian dishes will also live up to the same heights. Their noodles is splendid, the chilly garlic or the hongkong one... just go for it.
The price includes VAT and is also at very reasonable rates with good quantity on your plates.
The restro offers you a good dining or lunch experience, only if you are seated upstairs. The interiors are good, the waiters are polite and this a place that you can go again and again!!!
Keep up the good work people.

Excellent service. Food quality is very high standard. Peoples who will visit this place should try the soup once. if we consider the food option it is extensive. Quantity is also good . Ambiance is unbeatable. far better than other premier restaurants in Jadavpur like Bawarchi. People should visit this place once who are fan of restaurants like baawarchi, they will know the difference.

I have visited the place today along with my fiancé. It was a great experience indeed. We have ordered following items.
1.	Fresh Lime Soda salted .
2.	Fish Mofato - Little spicy & tangy  fish starter dish with shredded cottage cheese. Excellent in taste. 
3.	Egg wrap fried rice – It was Chinese mixed fried rice wrapped in a thin layered Omelette. The rice consists of too many prawns & chicken. Tastes very well.
4.	Mushroom & Baby Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce – It was a red gravy dish. Spicy & little sour in taste. I found it best among everything.
5.	Hunan Chicken - Sliced Chicken cooked in Hunan Style. Use of Bell Pepper is great in this dish.  
The décor of the restaurant was refreshing. The staffs of Calcutta Bistro were very much polite & efficient. But an old Bengali song playing in the background was somehow irritating. But above everything I recommended the place to everybody. It is must to mention that the price of the dishes are inclusive of VAT & Service Tax. It was a great experience to have a lunch in Calcutta Bistro.

This place is pocket friendly and good for your taste buds. 

I was extremely happy with t heir chilly garlic noodles and chicken section. My friend is a huge fan of navratna polao and that would definitely be on the list next time I visit this place. No extra VAT or service charges would make your day. 
They must add some variety to the dessert section though. 

I found the manager a little unfriendly since he always keeps an eye on the customer and their food. This might be just his job but it can intrude your privacy and comfort. Ignoring this, Calcutta Bistro is just the perfect place for a pocket friendly meal, especially for students.

As far as my review i would recommend if you are going for a date or something.....hit it!! can spare few bucks in pocket :)

I had heard of this place from  a few friends of mine before. Lastly got a chance to pay a visit last weekend with my friend soumya. I and Soumya go for a food fiesta every weekend on different restaurants. Located behind a petrol pump it isn't a pretty noticeable one, esp when you have Golden Gate and Red Chopstix just on the other side of the road.
We went there pretty early by almost 730 in the evening and had a gala time. Being a "Khaddo rosik Bangali" we tried both Indian and Chinese and believe me every dish had its own class.
We started with Lung Fung Soup, Fish Mofato and Chef special Murg Lasuni Tikka. The soup was heavenly!!.... and also the mofato and the tikka.... the best part about the food is it doesn't make you feel stuffed at all. We then went for Mongolian rice noodles and Lemon Chicken for main course... both tasted exquisite!! we then moved to indian and had tandoori roti and Badshahi Cashew Chicken....... (yes we did have both the same day, told you before, we are "Khaddo rosik Bangali") :-)
Thus we ended our food fest that day.
Another unique thing about them is they don't charge VAT in their bill and the sauff which they serve as the mouth freshner is menthol flavoured.. We had all this and guess what the bill didn't even go past 900. Calcutta bistro .. Take a Bow... _/l_

Quality meets Quantity.

This should be an appropriate tagline for this superb restaurant. Visited this place, uncountable times. And never did I leave unhappy or hungry.

Location: Located just behind the petrol pump, opposite of Sulekha.

Décor: Spacious and cosy, this place spreads over two floors. Ambience is really nice. And the waiters are really courteous.

 Food: Coming to the quality of food here, it is impeccable. Last time ordered Caribbean Drumsticks, Singapore Noodles and Thai Chicken, and believe you me, me and my fiend were stuffed. And all this for a whopping 410 bucks.
Love the Chinese, they serve here. I will especially recommend- Thai Chicken, Chicken in Hot Black Bean Sauce, Stir Fried Chicken and broccoli in Oyster Sauce. The only con that I can imagine is that the dessert section is not that good.

In any case, do drop by this place if you are near Jadavpur. It is a gem of a place.

calcutta bistro! hats off to u!
this restaurant undoubtedly is the best place in south kolkata for middle class families and students.banzara and golden gate are two nearby places which are in my favourite list,to dine in with my friends.but this place wins over the others,in terms of price,quantity and most importantly NO EXTRA VAT.
the restaurant has 2 floors,the upper one is preferable and more spacious,avoid the ground floor as it is very cramped and clumsy.we had to wait for a long que on sunday.so drop in early.their preparations are very well quality and quantity wise.the rice and noodles are sufficient for two,n most of the chicken and fish items have 8 pcs.decor is decent with red sofas and chilled a.c.service time is average.
from chinese we had hongkong and mongolian fried rice.both were superb.we had them with fish mandarin which was delicious,and thai chicken.this was extremely sour and not very much upto our liking.
from indian section, naan with chicken tikka butter masala was an awesome combo.
all these dishes costed about 750 bucks and left 6 of us full.we were super happy!!
but they should improve their desert section.the truti fruti at 125rs is not at all cheap.moreover they is much scope of increasing the varities of deserts.

this is again another restaurant which caters to both chinese and tandoor devotees alike.its in a very convenient loaction in jadavpur,although a few steps off the main road.it is branch of cit cafe which prompted us to visit.its smaller,but the food remains as good and more varied.we orderered schezuan and lollypops,an soup.it was deligtful,and we intend to revisit soon.the staff was attentive,and the service needs no reprimanding.

Dining at one of its best when it comes to moderately good ambience, decent service and great and tasty food. Calcutta Bistro is a pocket sized dynamite that serves excellent delicacies and is pocket friendly also. The biriyani and the prawn items are somewhat favorite of mine and I would recommend this restuarent highly if someone wants to grab a quick and stomach-full bite.....

P.S. Don't forget the Caribbean chicken in the starter menu. Oh heaven! Heaven!

DINING AT BISTRO IS REALLY A DELIGHT

Calcutta Bistro located at Jadavpur is perhaps one of  the best restaurants of Kolkata which can simultaneously maintain good food quality, good quantity, reasonable price combined with amiable service. Visited last afternoon wid couple of frnds & our order included American Chopsuey, Cantonese Noodles, Thai Chicken, Hong kong Noodles, Hunan Chicken, Hakka Noodles, Schezwan Chicken, Mongolian Rice, Kung Pao Chicken phew!!! and trust me all the items were good in taste. Specially The Mongolian Rice & Thai Chicken were just too good. Ambiance & staffs were really good. They dont charge any VAT & Service tax over the bill which makes it a sure dine in destination with a limited budget

Many a times had I seen this restaurant at Jadavpur Sulekha, but never visited, until yesterday, when finally we did!! Since its not on the main road, one has to follow signs that lead up to the restaurant, which has two floors. The interiors are cozy, with perfect lighting, and a calm ambience. we were led up to the first floor, which is more spacious.

For our orders, we went by the recommendations of the restaurant. For starters, we ordered Chicken drumsticks. The dish was so tasty that we ended up ordering another plate of it. For our main course we took Masala Kulcha, Navratan Korma, Malai Kofta, Cantonese Noodles, Prawn Fried rice and Garlic Chicken. Now I must tell you, the food is tasty, and the portions are ENORMOUS. So two dishes should suffice easily for three people. The chicken was tasty, well cooked, and tender. However, a minus point was that both the navratan korma and the malai kofta appeared to made in the same gravy base and so tasted the same.

Overall the food experience was really good. I ended up packing a plate of Thai Fish, one of their specialties, and that did not disapoint me as well, when I had  it back home. The prices are inclusive of taxes, so a meal for two, with starters, will come to a maximum of Rs 450.. 

Calcutta Bistro is a cheap, but quality food joint for people who wish to indulge in good food on a budget.

A very pocket friendly restaurant with good service and quality staff. Visited this place often for their Chinese cuisines, am very fond of their Hongkong/Mongolian/Singapore fried rice, which they serve with a egg wrap and salad on the top.One must try their pan fried chicken/fish, its too good.Haven't tried their indian dishes, so can't comment on that.Overall its been a pleasure to be there.

After seeing zomatos rating it was our plan for many days to visit this restaurant....but it was not happening...at last yesterday we went there....
on the 1st view my gf told me it is like CIT CAFE..means there are similarities of ambiance  between these to place.....actually in my point of view ambiance is very simple...not to much decorative...
regarding service they will win the match....very fast and cordial service from all of the staffs...somedays back we had a conflict with the manager of BAWARCHEE regarding attentiveness of the staffs...we complained and the manager arrogantly said a staff cannot stand beside you during ur dinner...this is my request to the manager of that restaurant that please go to calcutta bistro and look what is called attentiveness....
food is simply delicious...both the quality and quantity...we took our fav hot and sour soup,pepper fish,mixed fried rice and thai chicken....all are very tasty and we were very much satisfied...will go again and again...

Grab a bite or two at Calcutta Bistro!

Good food and a cosy ambience- these are the two things that any foodie looks for when he plans to dine out (Not that we are always lucky enough to enjoy this combination!). Often, customers who get to eat good food in a restaurant may not like its ambience. Remember, a restaurant can be called a foodie's paradise only if it offers awesome food and has a nice and cosy ambience. Calcutta Bistro, located on 50A/1A, Raja S C Mullick Rd, Near Sukanta Setu, Jadavpur, Kolkata, can be regarded as one of the top-rated restaurants in Kolkata as far as food, service and ambience are concerned. 

About three months back, I dropped in at Calcutta Bistro with two friends. We were voraciously hungry and were just looking for a nice and cosy place near Sukanta Setu where we could dig into lip-smacking food. We just came upon this restaurant, which is located on the main road. On entering this restaurant, we realized that cleanliness is not at all neglected here. The place was very clean and food served hygienically. Their service was actually good. As soon as we were seated comfortably, a waiter came and took our orders. I found him prompt and courteous. Within half-an-hour of placing the order, he arrived with our delicious preparations and placed steaming hot food bowls on our table. 

We had some fish mofato and seasame chicken nuggets as starters and some delicious Tom Yum Soup. Only a foodie knows how it feels when the aroma of steaming hot soup tantalizes the taste buds. I must say that both the fish mofato and seasame chicken nuggets were delicious. All thanks to the chef who has mastered the tricky art of cooking to satiate the hunger of this joint's patrons.

We also had some mutton sheek kebab which tasted awesome. Once done with our starters and soups it was time to dig into mouth watering navratan polao, prawn do piaza, badshai cashew chicken and chicken tikka butter masala ( all a part of our main course menu - yes, we are big eaters!). I must say that the food tasted delicious. Each spice was used in the right proportion to bring out the strong aroma and mouth watering taste. Calcutta Bistro also offers Chinese dishes.

I am a frequent visitor to Calcutta Bistro being very close to my house. The first and most important fact about this restaurant is that it is great value for money. The rates are real cheap and the prices are all including taxes. Second, the food you get at this price is surprisingly good, if not great.

There are not many dishes to recommend cause anything you order will impress you. The Chinese is better than Indian food here. You can try the Buttered Prawns (starters) and Humpty Dumpty (a fruit based smoothie).

The decor here is good, service is quick and the waiters are polite (though they don't smile).
So Calcutta Bistro is a nice place with good food, cheap rates and decent ambiance.

Delicious cuisines. Nice ambience. Both Chinese and and Indian cuisines are available. I often rank restaurants depending on their performance on festive days. If a restaurant can serve good food on a festival day (Durga Puja say), then it indeed puts quality at its top priority. I have witnessed many restaurants faultier on puja days, but not this one. They surely reduce the menu size but do not compromise on quality.

We are had been a regular visitor of CIT cafe in CIT road for last 10 years. Last year when we visited there, We were informed that they have opened a branch in Jadavpur which is near by to our place named Calcutta Bristo.This time I insisted my parents to visit "Calcutta Bristo" .At first we were not sure how te food/ ambience would be. The moment we entered , we were greeted by a known waiter from "CIT CAFE". The moment we had a look at the Menu Card , I was sure that the place is pocket-friendly. The decor was nice and last but not the least , food was "awesome" . Specifically loved "crispy cronjee chicken","Chilly prawn" and Mixed Noodled Cantonese Style" .Quantity as well as quality of food was great.I would recommend this place for foodies who love Chinese

I just the loved the " Kung pao Chicken" and Hongkong chicken" there. Even the desssert like " Tutti Frutie" is nice. Overall It is a good place to spend lazy sundays.

One of the better places to dine out or grab a quick bite on the lip smacking starters. I made it a point to visit this place after reading the reviews on Zomato and it was worth a visit. The 'chicken clear soup' we ordered was very good followed by the 'Prawn Arabian Salt and Pepper'. The prawn was not bad n they served 7 medium pieces in one plate. Next we thought of trying something from the tandoor and asked for 'Fish Tikka' which I personally found very tasty indeed. The behavior of the staffs are also good but do make it a point to go this place by 8pm if you are planning for dinner, otherwise people would be queuing up by the time it's 9. The best part was that the prices on the menu are inclusive of all taxes. Overall was very satisfied and hence rating it very good.

I went there yesterday for lunch. The place is almost camouflaged behind a petrol pump, but people who know Sukanta Setu and Sulekha shouldn't have a problem. They have a two floored seating arrangement (and the guy who seemed like the cashier generally redirects people to the upper floor if it isn't filled. So old ladies with knee problems beware).  But after the short trek it's pretty comfy. Unlike mentioned in the website, the place IS Air conditioned. Also, the actual prices are a bit higher than on the Menu in Zomato. I'll inform the discrepany right away. The menu was well varied, and we chose Indian. The waiter seemed friendly enough. The crowd (just one table, with a group of eight-ten) was extremely noisy, but that can be an exceptional case. They don't serve alcohol. We didn't have to wait for much long until the The Chicken Lasuni Kebab arrived. It was simply out of the world! I haven't had a juicier kebab in quite some time. The Chicken Shahi Biriyani and Parsi Mutton Curry (most probably that's the right name) were pretty good as well, but I've had better. Another thing I must mention is that the plates were warm, something that's missing in MOST of Kolkata's restaurants, and I'm very impressed with that. Once the bill came, it was an extra brownie coz the prices on the menu are tax included! I left with a happy stomach and heavier wallet than I had expected. This foodie recommends Calcutta Bistro to anyone with a modest budget living in Tollygunge-Jadavpur-Garia area. I'd rate it 3.5 out of 5!

Happy tummy pleasing! (or in Bangla: Subho Pet Pujo) :)

NO BAR   or DRINKS  but that is pardonable  given the excellent quality  & quantity  of food  ...  must try out pan fried  chilli fish  ,  very pocket friendly , waiters are decent ,   & even the crowd  is good, if you stay near jadavpur then don't miss this joint .... you will be amazed

I think this is one of the most fine dine in place at Jadavpur. First to say, service and behavior of waiters were excellent. Just had Chinese several times and I would say not all dishes but some of them were good. Liked "crispy cronjee chicken" and "Hot and sour chicken soup" both were very good."Kung Pao", "Hong kong rice" and "Mixed pan fried noodles" were also good. Keeping the quality, quantity for rice and noodles are too much to finish :). You will definitely get good food without thinking of your pocket.

i visited the place last saturday..the ambience was awesome upstairs and so was the food. The best thing i liked about this place was that the prices in the menu were all including taxes and yet, SUBSTANTIALLY LOW as compared to similar sort of restaurants in South Calcutta...The chinese dishes were excellnt..specially the Hong-Kong fried rice (non-veg) and the PAN-FRIED fish are really worth a try...crispy konjee chicken, as a starter, was also great....liked the waiters too and the service was pretty fast!! The menu-card given over here is more or less ok, with some of the prices varying by about Rs.10-15..One more thing, besides the taste, the quantity of food per plate is also quite good...for example, 2 plates of fried rice (any sort) would easily satisfy 3 hungry tummies!! A must try-out for all food lovers visiting or staying at south calcutta!!
Note: Although zomato shows that its not air-conditioned, in reality it actually is at the present moment!!

When I think about Calcutta Bistro, the one & only thing that comes to my mind is the "Quality of Food". One can get food of awesome quality. The service is good, the ambiance pretty, the price range comfortable. One must try Calcutta Bistro's Special menu. 
I have visited the restaurant more than 10 times. I can say that this is the best restaurant in Jadavpur area and one of the best in South Kolkata :)
