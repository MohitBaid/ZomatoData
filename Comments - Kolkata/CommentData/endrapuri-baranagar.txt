This is the second outlet of Endrapuri sweet shops marked in here. Sweet curd is a must try out in here. Other sweets quality is not that good as it was a few years back.

The radha ballavi of this place is just too good. Rasmalais are awesome you should try if you visit this place. Visit this place in the morning to try out the best sweets and radha ballavis of  baranagar area.

Do not go on the negative reviews of this place!!! How can any body just blatantly complain about such a wonderful sweet shop.. Anyway this shop is one of the most oldest sweet shop of Baranagar. The sweets are just simply awesum however one should really rise early in the morning to actually try the true delicacies that this shop has to offer which are its scrumptious Radha ballavis , singaras and jalebis which are served early in the morning and best eaten hot! Well ofcourse people who pass by the area would not actually know these intricate details which are available to a person who literally lives right beside the place. The golap jams are also quite delicious . All in all people who love sweets and are not attracted by the outward grandeur of a shop would  find this place suitable. plus side its quite light on the pocket too. :)

I have been to this place once and it is fairly good however doesn't stand out as best in the area.
Their emarti isn't that good while rest of the sweets were good especially sankh sandesh. Samosas aren't worth giving a try :-P and what I didn't like was, there were too many different kinds of flies inside the sweets cabin which is not very hygienic. 
Overall a decent one, will be better if they maintain cleanliness and should keep a dustbin atleast in front of the shop, this is so irresponsible asking people to dump waste in sewage which causes the streets to flood during rain.

they have a speciality of shor bhaja and shankh sandesh which was really good..apart from that their gulabjamun is very good..their shor bhaja is also of great make..and i really loves their gulabjamun which had a pur made of shuji it was very tasty..
i would like to visit and bring sweets from here..and would see their variety..i liked their mishti..they make quite good ones:)
