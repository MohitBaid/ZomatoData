I can't believe that I didn't rate this place in new alipore . I guess I have been visiting this restaurant since I learnt to eat and south Indian food specially dosa was my favourite since then . The previous outlet was near bidya Bharati school and had okayish sitting arrangements . But the food was legendary and inexpensive . One normal masala dosa could easily satiate one's hunger pangs almost for 6 hours . But after the outlet has shifted here , the entire thing k vice versa . Expensive , not satisfying and quality has degraded in total . Moreover you have no attached washroom to help yourself , you have to stagger to the staffs bathroom if it's extremely emergency which is not maintained most of the time .

The best South Indian food in Kolkata is served here and there is no doubt in it. I've been visiting this place since it was a small south indian eatery opposite The Kolkata Mint. Basically, i have seen it grow, and how!! I have tried almost all the items on the menu but nothing can ever beat the dosas and also, the sambhar is pure greatness!!
I have recommended this place to many of my friends and they all loved it!!

Went over there with friends and family while it was pouring outside. Had different variants of dosas which incidentally I can have for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also had idlis and vadas. It was seriously great. It's a very clean place and the service is good. The coffee over there is a must try. Ratings on the 5 most important aspects :

Not as popular as it once used to be, it still is a delight for the south Indian food lovers. It does not offer a wide variety of food type like most other restaurants nowadays do but the food available there is worth a try, at least once. Ambience and service is at par and the price is on the cheap side.

Always visit this place for lunch from my office as it is the nearest place to my office. 
The restaurant ambience is perfect. Food is average. 
But the rates of the foods are too high. Sevice quality is also not upto the mark. 
The waiter will always look hungry for tips as if they don't get paid from restaurant owner.

Located just beside New Alipore Petrol Pump, is the most simplistic and not worthy South Indian place. It's location has made all the name it has gained till now. It is a simple family restaurant with squeaky and wobbling chairs (more like cushioned stools). Red and White decor makes it all the more nauseous. The Wash basin and Towel are so old that even Government places have better, Earlier, it used to be a filled up place, but with growing new places and modern places, it lost its touch and has miserable failed to uphold it's brand name. However, being close to my home, at times when I feel lazy I order some food from here. Food is no doubt satisfying and has a good variety.
One can order or visit this place if you stay close. But I dont see any point coming from a distant place to have it's experience.

I had a very bad experience with this place very very recently...zomato and super snack bar don't do home delivery...so I had called up this place taking the help of zomato to place my take away order over the phone thinking that by the time I will reach the destination my food will be ready and will not have to wait. When I called up and requested him to prepare the order and will come myself to pick up the guy very rudely said "Nahi,  nahi hoga"  without even explaining the reason and banged the phone.

This kind of behaviour is totally unexpected and so thumbs down üëéüëéüëéüëé

The old SSB was far superior than the new one!¬†

However, having said that even though Super Snack Bar is just known for its South Indian, I find it inferior to the taste and quality of Jyoti Vihar and a few others, thus I end up always eating from the mix of dishes they serve apart from South Indian.¬†

The must try here include the Chola Bhatura and the pav bhaji.¬†

They can work on making the seating arrangement a bit for comfortable!

We frequently go to this place for lunch as its quite near to our place and is fairly reasonable!
The service is nothing extraordinary, but the food is good as compared to what they charge.
Our favourite picks from here are:-
Cheese Masala Dosa
Sambhar Vada
Paper Masala Dosa
Fresh juice
They really make good and fresh juice which one should taste if there!
There is one drawback about this eatery,  that they can work a little upon the seating arrangements!  The whole seating is very uncomfortable because there are no chairs with back rest.
Overall a nice and casual place for quick food.

The super snack bar is located at New Alipore. It mainly serves South Indian, North Indian along with pizza , burgers, sandwich & beverages.

Ambience is clean with sitting arrangenents comprised of stools, which is little uncomfortable.

Service is fine.

Tried Cheese onion sada dosa & Cold coffee. Dosa was decent. Cold coffee was nice too.

Pocket pinch is bit high.

LOCATION:

Located in New Alipore on the road adjoining the New Alipore petrol pump on the round crossing there. Keep going straight for about 150 metres and it will fall to your left.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Super Snack Bar has been a legendary name for their South Indian food and one of a kind pizzas and sandwiches. They use to be located at a different location in the same locality but have shifted to their current spot a few years back. Seating is an issue with only backless stools to sit on. My wife is pregnant and she had a hard time with her meal there. The same goes for old people or people with back problems. The interiors are ordinary and have been done up in white and red. The restaurant itself was neat and clean.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Onion Capsicum Pizza, Paw Bhaji and a Strawberry Milkshake.

The Paw Bhaji was decent. It was hot and well seasoned. But somehow it lacked freshness especially with the quality of vegetable produce that winters in Kolkata brings with it.

The Strawberry shake was good. It was tasty and had been churned with Vanilla Ice Cream. Its hard to go wrong with that combination.

I had a problem with the pizza. It was too thick and there was not enough sauce on the bread. All I could taste was bread, oodles of cheese and veggies. One does want to taste a tomato based sauce while having pizza. This was dissappointing.¬†

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Food definitely needs to improve and I think if they played some music, the sound of the kitchen and the staff shouting inside could be diluted to a certain degree which would result in a more comfortable dining experience. Also, more comfortable seating would be appreciated especially in parts for the pregnant women and elders.

VERDICT:

A legendary name in need of a facelift.

This place is my all time favourite. The dosas they serve are just mouth watering. Cheesa dosa has a lot of cheese in it. They give unlimited sambhar and chutney and the taste is superb. Special mention to "special chutney" which has to be ordered separately. Cheese pizza is a must try. Its yum. Cola float is also good. Medu vada is also a must try. Its an old restaurant. The decor is not very lavish. Service is fast. üôÇ
P.S The seats are not very comfortable.

Located in alipur. The best thing about the outlet is their service. Extremely prompt ...and always. So a great place to have quick south Indian food. Their sambar is really tasty. They serve a variety of dosas and all are yummy. Idlis,vadas n uoma are yummy too. The pav bhaji is nice but bhatura is very oily. 

The ambience is ok...but good place for quick and a reasonable meal. 

Only con ...is that the chairs are basically stools and so there is no back rest. Also sofa kind of seats are not that comfortable either. They should work on it.

Do visit and try south indian... Would not recommend other items. Not to forget the coffee. Its good.

Super Snack bar is a no nonsense place. They serve food from the heart. Not everything is grand or perfectly made but then sometimes you do crave that pizza so Indian that it should have its own name. The classics are the dosas,utthapams and the light idlis and vadas. Sometimes you might feel that the normal chutney is stale, just tell them they will be more than happy to change. The special chutney is quite heavy to be taken only when in a big group. The mysore masala, rawa are good to eat. The chola bhatura is huge but just your standard. So is the paw bhaji. But then you get what you pay . Standard dishes at standard prices. This is the sort of place where memories are made. Where small families start their eating out experience till they graduate to the fancier ones. But it will always remain in your heart. Must try is idli and vada.

The funniest thing about this unimpressive veg hub is that they shut down the place at 10:30 and allow customers to enter at 10:05! 
I went there with my parents once and we were having our food talking and taking our time, and mind you we entered the place at around 10:05 and we were allowed to come in and were seated. Towards the end of our meal (I was STILL eating my pizza), my father was handed a bill for the food we had. The bill was paid and quite generously tipped and I wasn't done eating my food. As soon as the waiter received the bill, we were promptly asked to leave. We were completely at a loss of words and I left my half eaten food over there and left the place at 10:45. When we asked the waiter the reason behind such an unexpected behaviour from their side, he replied that they close down the place at 10:30. 
But the weirdest part is that they allow people to enter at 10:05. Now unless you're Flash, you can't expect yourself to finish all your food by that time when they take 20 minutes to serve the food itself. Never expected this kind of cheeky behaviour but nevertheless I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody unless you magically turn in TO The Flash after ten or you're okay with eating burnt pizzas, stale chutney, vadas that smell of petrol or you're okay with getting served paper soda when you ordered plain dosa. Make a choice now. Cheers! :D

This place is just near the New Alipore Petrol Pump and its quite easy to find this place. This is a vegetarian place which I dont prefer much but the quality of food is decent and worth the price. The price tag is very reasonable and the taste food will make you happy as well.

Service:
The service is not as fast as you would like. The behaviour of the staffs are decent but they lack proper skills and experience.

Ambience:
=>Pretty Spacious
=>Simple Decor
=>Clean and Tidy

Food:
Its not many a times I went to this place but whenever I went, the experience was decent.
These are the things which I liked:
#Chola Bhatura
#Butter Onion Masala Dosa
#Cheese Pizza

Last Words:
The place is decent to have some snacks and chill with your buddies. Not a great place to have dinner though. If you wanna have some decent veg food with a reasonable price tag, this place is a good option.

3.5/5 for this place.

If you are looking for good south indian food then super snack bar is the best option which offers good quality food at reasonable price. Paper masala dosa and sambar vada is simple awesome. Will not recommend pizza of this place as it is not good at all. You can also have tasty chana batura. Parking is convenient. The only negative about the restrautant is its  chairs which is not comfortable for seating.

When they got the bill and had put the idli plate money in it too.. I just left with paying for everything other than for the idli.
This is not expected from such an old, good and a (now no more) reliable place where i frequented one time.

These guys first started out at the junction of Majerhat bridge and then moved to the area next to Kowloon restaurant at the New Alipore petrol pump. They were good back then and they are still so.

Tried their plain dosa, the vadas along with juices and shakes and found that these guys have still got it. The dosa was just lovely as was the vada and the rose milk shake was out of this world. Prices have obviuosly shot up but still well worth the experience.

Came here with my wife. Had a sudden craving for South Indian food... I had come here twice before today.  Surprisingly though, the food quality has detoriated quite a bit, unlike the pricing which has only increased manifold with time... With dissatisfaction at its peak,  the worst that could happen,  is that card payment option is still not available and I had to rush out to fetch money from an ATM. .. As though we have come to a Railway Station South India food stall.. Huh... Thoroughly disappointed... No need to visit this place,  as there are places in Kolkata where one can have the same quality of food for half of this price...

Pretty standard as things go. You have your most basic idlis and dosas and sambar and chutney. Nothing special there. The rawa dosa should come with a warning that they have green chilis in a the dosa itself since a lot of people( like me) can't eat extremely spicy foods. The fresh juices are pretty nice though.  And love the fact that they have Rollicks there which has been the all time favourite ice cream.

This place is a South Indian food lovers haven in new alipore...but it has a good stock for " fast food" on the menu backside. Firstly sticking to the usual I ordered a dosa and then since I had space I couldn't resist trying out a cheeseburger. Note : cheeseburgers in india don't always include a beef patty.
This joint was veg and hence I got served what I DIDN'T EXPECT AT ALL. ( The latter order )
I'll tell you why- I had imagined a patty with a cheese.slice and perhaps two buns to protect the bottom.and top but instead they went bonkers with their version. A potato patty with vegetable mush. Between two pav breads. And....and... To my odd delight... Cheese all over my plate. Every visible space had been filled with shaved cheese. It was definitely worth the money if it came to this. I didn't mind at all. Perhaps next year.would bring a few Mates to try this. Overall good clean place... Dazed out servers.... A curious juice stall and amazing sambar.

No matter how many times I have been here I always love this place and love having south indian here. It is simply one stop place for all your snacks cravings. They have several types of dosas and each one is better than the other. The dosas are large and fills up your stomach easily and fast. They serve all sorts of snacks and fast food. Have anything and it sure is going to make your tongue cry for more. I also love their chola bathura which is simply big with too good quantity. I am a die hard fan of south indian and so i love being here always.

The location is also good and it is a huge place which can seat more than a hundred people at one time. I mean to say its a all time running restaurant which keeps on making wonderful dishes. The service is also good, fast and hot always.

Must recommended by me and a must visit for all south indian and snacks lovers.

If you haven't been to super snacks bar a part of your childhood has been missing. Always crowded. Extremely good quality food same staff I have seen for last 20 years. Too much matter of fact. All the South Indian and North Indian items are good. Even the juices are very authentic with minimum water dilution.

This best snack bar in India is now in shambles. Yesterday entered their new address for a quick Lunch. Ordered 2 plates Idli's. Very good stuff. Nice sambhar and chutney. The problem was poor service. It took 15 minutes. The earlier place would serve in 2 minutes. The place is badly managed. Cleanliness is gone for a toss. The owners touch is missing. "Buck up soon or melt away"

This place used to be my regular childhood weekend outings till they shifted it to their new location. I had seen it from outside a few times and was pretty impressed with the decor. Yesterday I tried this place out and it was a nice experience.
Given this place is a cafe and the price range, it is pretty well kept and has a posh decor. Or it did when it had just started out. There are a few blemishes now, here and there, which can be easily ignored.
Coming to the food, we ordered chhole bhatore , onion rawa dosa and a milk-shake with ice cream. 
The chhole bhatore was amazing. The chhole were succulent and melt-in-your-mouth. The bhatore was not so greasy as I have had in other places and pretty light. They give you two bhatore in one plate and it's filling enough, an average woman stomach will be stuffed to the fullest with one plate. 
The rawa dosa was okay, didn't find it to be anything extra-ordinary. 
The milk shake with ice cream too was lip-smacking.
They have a pretty wide-range of food items to choose from, the service is quick, pocket-friendly prices- an all over good place to take a break from regular home food.

A primarily South Indian restaurant at the prime location of New Alipore. 
It serves various varieties of Dosas and enjoys a good reputation of serving some lip smacking south indian stuff! 
Also one surprise item in the menu is- Cola Float! An apt combo of vanilla ice cream & chilled coke!
It fits smoothly into the budget & does not put a hole in the wallet!
A must visit if you are in & around New Alipore :)

This is a pure vegetarian joint and this is one of the BEST south indian restaurants of Kolkata, serving lip smacking South Indian Food, Pao Bhaji and probably the BEST Chole Batore. This place has a separate juice parlour and a separate icecream parlour as well. The Juices are superb and too refreshing. Just love this place. Very courteous behaviour of the stuff,nice ambience and interiors and prompt service. Thumps up! :D

Accidentally visited the place to kill some time while waiting for someone. 
Located in a good locality, this place is generally filled up with people but i found it almost empty cos i entered the place just when it opened i.e. 9am. 
The place is too spacious with decent sitting arrangement but the upkeep seemed not so good. 
Ordered onion masala dosa and lassi. 
Dosa was good. Actually one of the biggest that i had eaten with proper stuffing and a crispy outer layer. 
The lassi was thick and tasty but could have done with less suvartin it. 
The poor rating of 2.5 is die to the poor service. Waiters being rude and the food taking about 30mins to be served even though only a couple of customers being present. 
Not a big fan of vegetarian food and the biggest hater of poor service, I'll gibe this place a miss in future.

This south indian branch in new alipore previously would use to be the best place for sunday breakfast and dinner in our locality. But since the days have passed, the quality of food has detoriated and the service is s***. No one even dares to step into this restaurant. I hope this branch could sort out the various issues and thrive in gaining its lost fame abd reputation.

This outlet was previously located near majerhat bridge but later shiftes to its present place i.e. near 3B bus stand, block "M" of new alipore. It has vast layout and floor space with a neat and cozy decor. It can easily accomodate 30-40 person at a time. They serve pure vegeterian food ranging from south indian, north indian, itailan etc. As it is situated at walking distance from my home i often pay a visit to this snack bar. Their offerings are quite good and tasty. Some of my personal favorites and their specialities are- channa batura, pav bhaji, utthapam etc. Their mango shakes during the summer is just unforgettable. During the weekends and specially sunday evening this joint stays completely filled and its hard to find a place to sit even after waiting. So its preferable to come early or do "take aways" during the weekends. Overall its quite a upscale and hygenic destination for the residents of new alipore especially the vegeterians.

SSB used to be an institution. 
Went for lunch the other day. 
The pomegranate juice was mostly water, the idlis insipid, the only flavour the sambar had was chillis. They didn't have Upma. The uttapam wasn't too bad. 
Better to stick to Jyoti Vihar and Bhupender Mansion for South Indian Food cravings.

Have been  visiting Super Snack bar since 1981 when we stayed just bang opposite to their Original outlet next to Boroline factory near Mazharhat petrol pump. You may choose anything from the menu and it so good. Their Sambhar ,Chunney are indeed very good that makes everthing Dosa, Idly, Vada  taste even better.  Our family has been very regular to the new Super Snack Bar outlet near New Alipore Petrol Pump . 

Pizzas are also very good. Very nicely baked , hot and crispy till the last bite.

The sudden pang of having lip smacking South Indian cuisine at New Alipore has to be in SSB ( I love their Dosas & Vadas esp)  ! 
The outlet is quite spacious with no fuss table arrangements . Menu offered is quite a variety too with both North & South Indian spreads . 
  I feel the only drawbacks here would be 'no restroom' & 'HIGHLY SULKING men ' (sulking & serving) , so a 3.5 for me !

Location: New Alipore, Near Suruchi Sangha. 

This is a fast food centre cum South Indian  restaurant. Serves good quality food and is hence quite crowded during weekends. Being a pure vegetarian joint, I keep visiting this place with my family. Expect a waiting of atleast twenty minutes. Ambiance isn't something to be excited about, pretty simple and non-descript. 
In short, the Fooding is good, service is quick and prices are pocket friendly (considering the servings).¬†

Detailed:
About the Fooding, these were ordered across a number of visits: 

- Paper Plain Dosa 
Is something that most south Indian joints fail to produce! 
Here, the dosa is super crisp, super thin and the length is approximately 18" or I guess more. 
Great to eat. 

- Cheese Onion Dosa 
Loaded with cheese and sliced onion in perfect balance. 
Tastes great.¬† 

- Plain Dosa 
Nothing great about it, is soft and good eat. 

- Onion Rawa Dosa 
Made with a lighter consistency of batter and topped with onions, this dosa is an absolute delicacy.¬† 

- Special chutney 
This chutney is one of their specialty.¬† Is a dry chutney topped with crackled mustard seeds. Great accompaniment. 
Recommended with south Indian food.

- Sambhar tastes good as well. 

- Idlis 
Soft and melt in the mouth types. 

- Plain Vada 
Crisp but slightly oily at times. 

- Chola Bhatura 
The bhaturas are big in size and two in number. But, slightly greasy too.
The chola tastes good. Served with sliced onion & cucumber, chillies and pickle on the side.

- Mix pizza 
Was great to taste, not as good as pizza joints, considering a fast food centre, tasted great. Indianized pizza. 
Topped up with tomato, onion, capsicum and cheese.¬† 

- Cola Float 
A personal favorite, cola served along with a scoop of vanilla icecream. 
Yumm. Nothing unique but good. 

- Cold coffee with ice-cream 
This is a dicey drink out here, at times you would be served such a drink that you would want more of it, and at times such that you'll not be able to finish the one served to you. 
Wish for a consistent service. 

- Papri Chat¬† 
Okay, this dish was an absolute disaster.¬†
Just had sweet tamarind chutney along with curd. Lacked flavours.
Kindly refrain from ordering.

The staff was quick, courteous and well informed.¬† 

Prices are pocket friendly (considering the servings).

Overall a decent experience (considering all visits).

this outlet has drastically reduced the quality for all items including DOSA ,for which it is known for!!

I have been going to this outlets for last 3 years now....and I have observed drastic price hike of more than 3 times in last 1 year!!    where as for masala dosa , they reduced the "alu stuff' quality and quantity both !!   first it happened in the month of march 2014 when one sunday I visited wth my family on a sunday....when crowd is maximum!!  I told them to increase the ALU SABZI..which they did after lot of persuation....and unnecessarily arguments!!   all other restaurants giving same item at 2 times less price also does not give such less 100 gm sabzi for the dosa...which is priced at 97/-  now...2.5 times costlier......outside decent place a dosa I s privced at 38/-   same one!

this happened today also , on 12th may 2014 after giving vote I went to have my lunch...as usual same less alu sabzi was given which I protested and they shouted wth me without understanding the problem....its  a clear notion of 'cheating THE CONSUMER EVEN AFTER HIGH PRICE!!   ALSO THE JUICES ARE FILLED WITH WATER AND SPOILED UNHYGEINIC pomegranate..which is not the fresh one as it tastes in new mkt and elsewhere better..when I wanted to complaint this to the manager they got furious..i visit lot of good eateries including Hi end dinings and middle one in the city and outside Calcutta..i never saw such cruel intention of the business form!!  I am surprized how ZOMATO has rated them good??   this episode of  less ALU SABZI inside is going on for long time...and it appears to be the owner instruction !!!  why shod I pay more and eat less??  are you listening??  I will surely spread this worst experience of mine with key people in F&B circuit Kolkata...I visit global kitchen ...quest mall maimland china, oh Calcutta , peter cat ,garden caf√©..everywhere I found decent people who endorses the view of customer and not CHEAT LIKE THIS!! also the chef of quest mall /global kichen is extremely polite and well behaved who I share a good rapport with...I will share my experience with him..surely   and  ....today was my last day in this restaurant and I will now only visit GARDEN CAFE alipur which is less priced and better quality!!  no one shd even consider SUPER SNACKS BAR..they are careless because of those rich marwaris..who go there and pay blindly!!!

Super Snack Bar is a very old restaurant, which has moved to a new location. The south indian food is what they are famous for. They have large variety of south indian dishes. They also keep ice cream. 

When this new outlet opened their interiors were very nice but when i went last it was dirty and dilapidated.

The service is average.

Really  - A snack bar that serves some super snacks!
3.5 out of 5

Very close to New Alipore Petrol Pump and New Alipore Railway Station, Super Snack Bar is one of the favorite hang outs for many who love to gorge into delicious vegetarian delicacies that pacify the taste buds while providing a wholesome meal (and at reasonable rates!). The ambience is quite soothing as well as stimulating because of the tempting images of desserts, beverages and other foods all across the wall. Quite spacious but with limited seating arrangements - something they can improve by adding more chairs and tables without cluttering the place because on weekends diners literally have to stand in a queue to get a table.
 
This place has gained much popularity among foodies because of its quality service as well as excellent food. Though they serve both North Indian and South Indian food, according to me this place is extremely good for South Indian food with an average rating (at best) for their North Indian cuisine. 

They have many options in dosas starting from sada to masala and rava. I generally prefer masala dosas of different varieties and all the dosas that I have tasted here are really awesome. The cheese onion masala dosa, paper butter masala dosa and rava masala dosa are a must try here. Mixed utthapam is another thing that like here. Their sambar and chutney are good and have lots of south Indian flavor. 

In North Indian section, one can try paw bhaji followed by mixed or papri chat. It is my suggestion - do not order any pizzas here because they are horribly prepared here and you will be disappointed. However, the chats are good though the prices are not in line with the quantity and taste that they provide. According to me, the rates of their chats are a bit high. You will find many juices here, and this section really rocks. Their healthy fruit juices will quench your thirst, leaving you refreshed. Among the other beverages, I always prefer cold coffee with ice cream.

Their service is quite fast and no one will feel unattended. The waiters are always around you to serve you, even when your table is filled with South Indian food and you need to get your samber and chutney bowls filled from time to time. 

One thing - if you are driving a car to this place, parking can be an issue to worry about.

Have been visiting this place since I was a kid. This particular joint is a new one though. It's previous outlet in New Alipore closed down and it got shifted to this location. The quality of food is very good. Dosas and idlis are what they specialize in. I particularly also enjoy their fresh juice from the juice bar. Also their Chana Bhatura, Pav Bhaji and Parathas are also high on taste factor. Apart from these filling items, you should also try their lassi, dahi baha and chaats -- the quality of dahi is especially good.

Super Snack Bar in New Alipore has been synonymous with good south Indian food for years. Have been visiting this place for a long time and have rarely left disappointed. It has a very good ambiance, the seating could improve though. The dosas ranging from sada dosa to masala dosa to rava dosa are all tasty. The Idli and Sambhar vada taste good. The accompaniments (sambhar and chutney) are always fresh and good to taste. 
The Chola Bhatura is very tasty here. Didnt like the chaats. The Chai is superb so is the Tutti Frutty. The service is quick and you always find the place abuzz with people as it has maintained its quality part throughout the years. Its pricing is reasonable and dosent burn a hole in your pocket. Overall a good resto for South Indian fare. 3.5 stars for Super Snack Bar.

Now anything which has sambhar as an accompaniment is automatically my favourite. 
Like, Sambhar+Anything= I want it<3

I like Sambhar. I have been to the Super Snack bar in Minto Park which does one of the best Sambars in Calcutta.

This place just can't replicate the recipe right. 

I visited it, again, yesterday night. I tried the Plain Rava dosa, Masala Dosa and papri chat. Apart from a variety of South Indian food it keeps North Indian Chaat, Burgers, Pizza, Fruit juices and Ice-Creams.

The Papri Chat was pretty good. Do try it if you have a liking for Chaat. The Masala Dosa was again very good. Rava Dosa kind of didn't match up. There were hints of Jeera in it and it was a tad bit undercooked.

The service was great. The quiet busboys are easy to call and quick to refill your sambar and chutney. Order doesn't take much time.

The ambience is comfortable. This place was earlier located near Majerhat Bridge and shifted near Durgapur Bridge. Round red seats and rectangular tables give it a Super Snack bar look. I like the ambience as there is plenty of air between two tables and at no point you will feel your neighbours breath down your neck. There are washbasins on one side and a juice/ice-cream counter on the other. One wall is done up entirely in glass. I particularly like places with glass walls especially at night.

Pricing is easy on the pocket. South Indian food is hardly expensive no matter how much you order. The service is good. And the hygiene is clean.

I give this place a 4. It's a place you frequent with family: )

Have been there 2 to 3 times. I did not like their food quality.. Dosas were tasteless and idlis were horrible...Its completely a vegetarian eatery. But i only liked their juices. Service is slow and staffs are okay. i tried there pizzas also,,,i thought that homemade pizzas are better than that.  No special ambience and prices are moderate. They need a lot improvement. I would rate 2.0 for THE SUPER SNACK BAR.
:(

Super Snack bar is one of the 1st few places in the city that started serving pizza. 
Being predominantly south Indian restaurant, this place was a landmark and going there on a Sunday was a herculean task as people waited in queues. 

they hav a good assortment of fresh juices... although i feel over the years the quality has come down.. but i still like to visit for the nostalgia. getting a parking near it can be a little tough.

or else its worth going to... pocket friendly and  value for money.

If I remember correctly this place used be close to Majerhat bridge area; can't recall for sure. 

A south Indian joint - very average. Location is good. 

Negatives - no restroom, wash area dirty, food bit overpriced considering quality, attendant attitude below par, chairs are nearly falling apart, utensils could be cleaner. 

Positives - convenient location (for me) if in mood for south Indian, place is big :P

Things you can try 

Paper Sada Dosa
Paper Masala Dosa
Rava Onion Masala Dosa
Paper butter Sada Dosa
Plain Vada
Idly
Pomegranate juice 

Here's a piece of advice - when you do take away - avoid newspaper wrapping - if the food is touching it that ain't good for you tummy. Few wraps it in banana leaf - that's good. This place uses newspaper only - aw craps it too darn lousy! If you wanna eat, eat in.

Been coming here ever since I can remember .... for me Super Snack Bar means Cheese Plain Dosa ! They also serve good idlis and vadas though I feel the vadas have become a bit oily of late. I also have eaten their cheese pizza quite often and it reminds you of a simple home made pizza with no frills. They have a decent variety of juices and I eat here often as it is located fairly close to my office. Good value for money as well.

Customers are given no respect here. We were asked to vacate our table because another bigger group had arrived, even though we were seated way before they arrived. 
Another family who went through the same experience even had an argument with the management. 

About the food:
south Indian is avg.
sandwiches are bad.
shakes are decent.
service is obviously  pathetic. 
prices are a bit on higher side.
disappointment: high probability!

For the price they charge, they could served better food. Oily dosas, pakodas; vadas were soggy and tasteless, the chutney doesn't have the coconut taste and is just too creamy.The sambar tastes as if made from a ready mix. I have tasted better south Indian fare from roadside vendors.This place disappointed me.
