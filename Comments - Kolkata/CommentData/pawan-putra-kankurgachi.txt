A pure vegetarian restaurant with a welcoming ambience and friendly staff is what makes Pawan Putra a fine dine experience. If one wants to have amazing North Indian food, this place can be visited. I recently went there with a group of friends, and we tried a bunch of dishes, none of us failed to satisfy us.

If you are craving delicious north indian food, you can try this restaurant.
Good place to take your full family to.
I ordered :
Plain naan : (4/5)
Butter naan : (4.5/5) This one was delicious.
Dal makhani : (4/5) Must order item.
Kadhai paneer : (3/5)
Cantonese noodles sauce : (1/5) the noodles were too soft as if it was from yesterday. This place is good for north indian food. So ordering chinese is not recommended.
Vegetable manchurian : (1/5)
Lemon ginger on the rocks : (3/5)
Kiwi ice : (3/5)
Cranberry plaza (2/5)
