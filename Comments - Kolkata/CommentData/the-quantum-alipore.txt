I went with my friends today on the 31st eve. It was great to be there, the ambience was great, very spacious, staff were courteous. The food was really good with a very reasonable price even after taking hookah and alcohol.

Foodies with a penchant for quirk, and an eye for geeky get-up will simply love The Quantum Kitchen and Lounge. The smart decor topped with quick service is always a plus, when you plan to eat out. The food is amazing, at affordable rates. So, Chill out at the lounge with Hookah or fine dine with your loved ones, this place will surely steal your heart.

You will keep coming back for more. To hog some more.
