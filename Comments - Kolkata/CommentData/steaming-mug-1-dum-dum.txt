One day while taking a stroll down the streets we found this lil quaint place, the place has its own charm. Beautiful interior decor with intricately designed walls, and they have absolutely heart warming music collection.

Coming to food we ordered :

‚Ä¢ Cold coffee
‚Ä¢ Chicken sandwich
‚Ä¢ Honey glazed chicken wings
‚Ä¢ French Fries

Cold coffee had enough froth but they gave minimal amount of milk hence it didn't taste good.
Preferred the sandwich most of the all.
Chicken wings were good as well, but I found it tad bit sweeter.
French fries were fine though.

RATINGS :
FOOD : 3/5
AMBIENCE : 4/5
SERVICE : 4/5
VFM : 4/5

A small cozy cafe in Northern Avenue. Great place to hang out with your friends. But only 8 people can be seated at a time. 
Affordable.
Service is a little slow.

This place is near to old ice and spice in northern avenue. A small cozy cafe for friends and couple to grab a cup of coffee and chit chat. What i liked is their  collection of music played. All unplugged versions of recent songs were being played, which refreshed my mind. Not much on the menu. Sandwiches, coffees, and for other pls refer to menu. I forgot. They cam accommodate 10people at a time. Worth a visit. 
Four of us were there. 
We ordered honey chicken, Buffalo chicken, fries, cold coffee with ice cream and brownie with ice cream. 
We were there for more than 1hour gossiping and clicking and enjoying. All and all it was a good experience.

A very small cafe opposite to Ice and spice near seven tanks , dumdum. Well one of the most attractive feature of this cafe is the decoration and the ambiance. Its really very cozy the sofas , the showcase and wall painting and decors are really awsome , it really gives a good vibe. The only problem is that there are only 3 sofas. And getting a seat is really a problem.Another funny thing about this place is that there are no staff, there is a door inside the cafe and if you want to order you will have to knock and a guys comes out takes the order and serves. For everything you need to knock, no one stays inside the cafe.
As for the food its quite good for an cafe with such an ambience.We had ordered cappuccino, chicken 65 , chicken tikka sandwhich and ice cream with brownie.
The sandwhich was really tasty with lots of chicken and cheese served with chips.
Chicken 65 had 6 pieces of chicken which were a bit overcook but tasted good.
Cappuccino was so-so.
And the ice cream with brownie was also standard.
To sum it up its a good restaurant and dumdum really needed one such. A good place to visit.

This small but beatiful food joint is just 300m from my house. Easy to locate at Norther Avenue. The joint is small though. But the decor is eye-candy. Comfortable sofas. Ideal for a coffee break in the evening. :)
We ordered a lot of things from their good but simple menu. The Cheese and Chicken Sandwich was awesome with cheese gurgling out. The brownie with icecream was good as well. The Chicken in Barbeque sauce is fairly nice. 
Some cons:
1.You have to call the waiter time and again for ordering and every other thing. 
2. Space problem-really small.

This is probably my best discovery as a foodie. I have been known for experimenting with my food choice and i wouldn't lie, it is not always a praise from the other end as i don't experience it alone. But this small cafe in northern avenue near dum dum is the best find. I saw this place quite a few time while going to lake town. And always wanted to visit for its decor and cozy atmosphere.

So finally we decided to visit this place. And our jaw dropped after seeing the price. The sandwiches were cheaper than that of a road side shop with no hygiene. We ordered one french fries, chicken 65 and one chicken tikka sandwich. French fries were properly cooked. Quantity was great and came with a lot of mayo as a dip. Chicken 65 was ok, nothing extra ordinary. It is essentially 6 fried boneless chicken pieces with sprinkled chat masala and lime juice. My partner seemed to like it. The sandwich was of supreme quality considering the price and tasted quite good.

After this experience, this small joint has been our go to place for hangouts. Go here for the tea, coffee, cookie and sandwiches. The menu is very compact. You won't get too many options. But the things they do serve, they serve it the best they can. Don't expect anything exceptional. Let me remind you this is a very small cafe with only three tables, rather couches. This cafe is definitely not the best at anything and i don't think they are trying to be, but they tick right about every boxes for a bang for buck hangout.

A nice place with comfortable sofas... but the capacity to hold much people is less. I love the chicken tikka sandwich there. The lemon tea is nice. The crispy honey chicken wings is a must try there. Hope they include some pasta dishes soon...

Steaming Mug is a cool place for hangout. It is located at DumDum .

Ambience & decor is colorful and nice, but has limited sitting arrangements.

Tried Chicken 65 & Cappuchino. Chicken 65 was average, nothing special. Sipping Cappuchino was a delightful experience.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

The Steaming Mug ,located just opposite to the old restaurant Ice and Spice near Northern Avenue is a small cafe ,yet a great place to visit .
Why ?
1.The ambiance is great ,cozy and comfortable .
You can spend as long as you want to until there are customers waiting to be seated.
Its a great place to go with your friends and family.
The decoration is good too.
2.Food is good ,especially I like the sandwiches.
Corn and cheese sandwich is my favorite at times extra cheese makes me happier,Chicken Tikka sandwich is great too.
Ice creams of rs 40 comes with two scoops and a must have.
About the Chicken 65 and the others below them in the menu card are wholesome of chicken and great in taste.
3.Price is affordable and quiet cheaper than the other cafes around and prices are inclusive of tax.
So keep on eating ,still your tummy will be full and wallets will be half filled with your money .
4.Service is okay.You have to knock on the door to call them and order.
Its a bit slow but still okay in the beginning.
Overall ,Its a great place to be and keep eating ,and keep talking with your buddies and click pictures too.

This place is a small cozy cafe. Very much pocket friendly. The ambience is kind of nice. The food quality is so so.
We ordered Cappuccino, Masala Tea, Chicken 65. The cappuccino was good though. Chicken 65 is nothing special, but kind of regular chicken pakora. 

The ratings are as follows,

Food Quality 2/5
Ambience 3/5
