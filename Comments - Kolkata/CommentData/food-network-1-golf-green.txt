I have had the chicken cheese balls and pasta with white sauce and both were equally good. The price range is appropriate with the quality food served.

For people residing in Golf Green, Bijoygarh, Bikramgarh and adjoining areas, locating the place is quite easy. The place is in the line of Needs Store in Golfgreen. The place is fast food joint with Chinese and continental service. The food is pretty good and quite easy on the pocket. Must try.

Heard a lot about that place and had a lot of expectations and was very much disappointed as well ðŸ™„
Firstly the dishes we wanted to order was not available thus had to change our mind and had finally ordered Chicken Steem Momo and Chicken Noodles
The quantity was very disappointing! The tasty was very average
Oh! We opted the home delivery option
I will think before visiting this place again ðŸ™„ðŸ¤”

Food quality is excellent. They care a lot about the taste and preferences as per requirement of my child.. He loves the food out here. Behaviour is great.
On time delivery..
Crispy chicken tastes really good..
As far as other dishes like friedrice , garlic chicken tastes really good.
Hope they would also start up with the mughlai dishes too.

Tried this new joint today, as for the starters, momo and the chicken mayo wrap was simply brilliant. In the mains, the egg chicken fried rice had a true touch of authentic chinese fried rice and tasted very nice, schezwan noodles was also very good. As for the sidies tried the Devils chicken which had a signature flavour, spicy and loaded with babycorn and mushroom and would make your taste buds very happy.
Moreover all this at a very reasonable pricing and in a very hygienic environment.

Its a new food joint and they also have home delivery which is good. The food is of good quality and hygienic. They also prepare wraps which is the highlight of the place. I will recommend to give it a try.

This is a joint serving variety of items from momos to fries to noodles to rolls to rice.  Located opposite to UCO BANK ATM beside Need store, cordial behavior , quality is good and so is quantity..  Have tried their pan fried momo,  schezwan noodles, chicken cheese roll and chicken wraps..  Must say all the items are 'YUM'..  Initiative by friends..  Must recommended for evening snacks to main course dinner if u are looking for a Pocket friendly day.. What more..  They are dropping the food at home within certain reach.. !!!

A venture of my brother from another mother. Freshly opened with a twist of a classic cartoon channel from 90s which was an essential part of our growing up! From the very first day they're doing quite well and it you're lucky then within a small amount of time you'll get your food. Orelse you have wait for a while cause of their amazing following and regular customers. Had one of the best pan fried momos from here. It took 5 mins to serve the dish to me fresh and hot! Mouth watering taste and the quantity is perfect. I'll try out more dishes too! All the best to this budding food joint! Hope to see more interesting dishes and foodies at your shop.

Price is cheap..seating not available..but there are plenty of add-ons. They will deliver within 2 k.m. if the bill amount is just â‚¹100 or more. Moreover the food is extremely tasty and hygienically made. But since it is a newly opened shop with 3, 4 boys only, I had to wait for a very long time for 3 egg chicken gravy noodles. Plus I wanted mixed gravy noodles but they didn't have prawn hence egg chicken. Overall I would say good.
