A nice sweet outlet located on DH Road. Price is very reasonable. I really loved the gulab jamun, rosogolla and laddoo here. Sweets are baked fresh too.

Radha Shyam Sweets is located at Behala. It's an old shop which is quite famous in this area. They sells a variety of sweets.

Ambience is tidy.

Service is quick.

Tried Kachagolla , Dhokla & Singaara. All were pretty decent and fresh but still not the best. There are many other options.

Pocket pinch is reasonable .

A very old shop. Their misitis are really very good. I have tasted a few but long ago when I used to there to teach.
Rosogolla, Kalojam, Kanchagolla every thing tasted very good here. I used to pay a visit whenever I passed this area.
