This is what old park street is made up of. Affordable food and booze and amicable staff and a lot of nostalgia is what Silver grill is made up of. It's probably not a fancy place to dine at with exotic delicacies, but one needs to have spent time here with friends laughing and chatting loudly to understand the value of this place.

Went with friends on 31st Dec night as we didn't able to get a table in Olypub. We faced a horrible situation which was enough to ruin our year end fun.
First of all, the choice of available beer was very limited. Food was very cheap. There is not smoking area inside.
Even if you manage to tolerate these things, the most dangerous experience was the guy (old enough for not working in a bar in Park Street area) who waited our table. He was pushing us to take food items continuously and his behavior was very rude.
Ultimately, the last nail in the coffin was the cashier. He was not ready to accept the payment via card whatsoever and was giving such silly excuses.
Hence the punch-line is, not recommended at all.

It's surprising how such low grade restaurant even exist in Park Street. We had order American Chopsuey, and Hakka noodles. My aunt ordered vodka with lime soda. But surprisingly even after clearly mentioning our order, me and my sister were served soda too. When we reminded them, the staff became rude and refused to take those back. Even the manager was no help at all. Ultimately we had to pay for two extra lime sodas. The food was very bad either. Overall not a good experience at all.

Located at the heart of Park St. Certainly one of the oldest chaps in business. The decor is unchanged for quite a few decades. Food is pretty average. We took roast pork along with fried fish fingers. The pork was a bit stiff and the fish fingers were full of vinegar. The best part of Silver Grill is that they won't disappoint you with fuckall strong beers like Olypub or Magnolia or other famous pubs in and around that area. In short, if you like strong beers and prefer less food with your drink, this is a pretty decent place.

Location: Park Street,Near Flurys.

Visited this place on a sunday afternoon for a couple of drinks and snacks,I was along with a few friends and found no place in olypub as it was overcrowded,so we decided to hit this place.

Ambience and Dec√¥r: There is nothing much of a decor,its simple with shabby old interiors,the ground floor is for everybody and the first floor is for familys.

Food and Drinks:

Dry Chilli Chicken: It did not taste as bad as it is stated in the reviews,It tasted decent enough and was on the spicy side.Perfect companion for drinks.

Among drinks we opted for Kingfisher beer and blenders pride,the drinks were reasonably priced and served with peanuts.

Service:

The service was not top notch but considering the waiters were very old,they did a pretty good job.

Recommended if you want to catch a few drinks at a reasonable price.

Worst service, less quantity, price hiked by 30 rupees each item...but quality and quantity degraded. They are not serving also...only settles the bottle on ur table.
Their main dish pork slice roasted also lost its quality.

Had to come here, as Olypub was out of Kingfisher beers. And what a great thing that was. This is situated beside flury's and gives that old days bar feeling. The best part is the price. 170 bucks for a bottle is dirt cheap. So the next time someone asks me which is the cheapest place to booze with the best service possible. Silver Grill is the place I will reccomend.

Yesteryears watering hole, that used to be a must visit restaurant once in 2 months for the sake of chili pork and beer in my salad days . I remember Mr Gomes, and his all attentive eyes serving efficiently whatsoever you order for. My last visit was not quite of the same experience though. Be it with the taste of food or the service. Perhaps they need to re-energize and restart.

Food is disastrous. The ambience of the places gives you the feels of a mere 'Raju/Lakhsmi Bar & Restaurant' type place. 
Food is way too much costly as compared to the level of the place. Service is poor as well. The only thing you get good is alcohol. A definite 'DON'T GO'.

One of the preferred drinking holes for office-goers around the Park Street Area. Doesn't score very high on cleanliness or hygiene factor. Has a good collection of Beers. Noted dishes are Chilli Pork, Roasted Pork Slice, Pepper Chicken, Chilli Chicken. Just mention the waiter to prepare them with less Salt. Smoking not allowed inside. You can have your fag outside.

Located between Flurys and Hakuna Matata , it is an ancient gem for Chinese lovers. It is the rare mix of peaceful boozing and good food. Yes the¬† interior requires more finesse and touch but still it gives u a sense of familiarity. Food is good. Chilli pork, fish-fingers, chicken in cashew nuts, chili crab etc¬† are few items ppl should definitely good. ideal place for boozing . In terms of variety , plenty to chose from. A good place for casual dining and to hang out with friends.

If you like Pork, then you must visit this joint. Try cold Beer (a lot of options are there and rates are quite reasonable) with Chili Pork on a summer afternoon. I have been there several times and every time I compulsorily had their signature Chili Pork. In fact, I will rate their Chili Pork as definitely one of the best of Kolkata, surely among the top 5.

We went here during the puja... Food was okay and the drinks were probably cheaper compared to other places on Park street... but the waiter who served us was very rude. Don't take this job if u don't know how to be polite üòä 
We paid him for the bill and were supposed to get back the change out of which we would have tipped him. This is what you'd expect,right? But this old guy who was serving us REFUSED to give back the change saying he took it as tip. I couldn't believe that a restaurant on a place like Park Street hires such kind of people.I didn't want to create a scene so I let it be. I wish I could give a negative rating. DON'T visit this place.

Located at Park street just few steps ahead of Hakuna Matata. Basically this place is for those who loves to hang out with wine and beer. Went there few weeks back with few people for a hangout. As a non alcoholic i was just there for the food and company. The place looks little cozy and dark and has got red colored sofa sitting inside with good amount of tables up for grabs.
We tried their Chilly Pork and friends had their beer. Its a decent place for a long hangout.

One of the worst places to go in Park Street. I guess I visited this place after 15 years. It was good previously. Now, Service, food, everything is awful. Price of the food is also on the higher side. The waiter said that there is no food available as it was already 11 at night. He also asked for tips because we did not give any. Who would in their senses would give tips for such horrible service. The fish fingers were not even served properly. The ambience was good and peaceful. The booze was cheap. Now I know why the place was empty when we entered the restaurant on a Saturday night. It is all because of the above mentioned reasons.

For patrons of the greatest place on Earth, and strictly for them only, Park Street would have been poorer without one of its earliest inhabitants, the ubiquitous Silver Grill. Tucked aside the behemoth called Flurys, this nondescript restaurant is much more than that. A restaurant. It's a moving example of the changing times and our struggle to remain the same. Slightly offbeat in nature, and probably some might even use the word shabby, this watering hole is a foodies delight. For the booze guzzlers, it's a boon in an otherwise pricey locale, for me a gastronome's den. 
The crispy chilli chicken, the honey chicken and the mixed fried rice can any day be my last meal. The icing is the service. I have never ever come across a waiter, not smiling. The ecstacy of Park Street is embodied within the dimly lit confines of this awesome refuge. 
I am a sucker for good food and Silver Grill more than makes up for that. The ambience is old world and I am pretty much won over by it. Dine, discuss and drive away. With a smile. Silver Grill assures you of that.

He is extremely rude and more concerned about collecting bills than serving customers. Had beer and chilli chicken boneless. Could not even dare to order something more just because of the pathetic slow and rude  service. Never going back for sure!

Used to be quite regular to this place ages back. The bar section when you enter should really be avoided. However, the first floor is the dining area where you can actually dine at peace. We never got this place jam packed, sometimes totally empty. And that exactly where the advantage was.

I've always liked their food. Nothing extraordinary but they serve quite typical chinese food as others in park street. Reasonable prices too.

Basically we ordered drinks from here and a Hakka chicken chowmein.
The drinks ordered were served in proper glasses and all and the people who waited our table brought the snacks or the 'chaat' as we call it that goes gratis with the drinks at regular intervals.
Now coming to the service...it was good but not the best I have come across. The food took really long to arrive. But all in all, the experience was good.

Last day I and my bestie of college went to this awesome place.Well starting off the food is of exquisite quality. Infact if you're like Chinese connoisseur like me this is the place for u.The items that we ordered were Boneless Chilli Chicken as a Starter, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Prawn Fried Rice, Pepper Chicken and Chilli Pork in Red Chilli Paste (I think). We ate the chilli pork ravenously. The quantity also is pretty good. For the bar I would say there are not many options to choose from but bar is cheap. It'll very disappointing if you're planning to go out for lunch with your date to this place. It is basically for college goers and if u have a huge rowdy horde along with u you'll enjoy a lot because the place is not privy. I really liked the sofas, they were very comfortable. And I'd prefer had there been music playing. Though these are all lilliputian faults one major erring was they took a lot of time to take the orders and deliver them. If u are in a hurry, choosing this place would be precarious for u. Another major drawback was there was just one waiter to take all the orders so the work load on him was clumpy and people from all around the room was calling him to wait at the the respective table.

A few days ago, a friend of mine took me to this place. A meeting was arranged between three of us, and it called for a special occasion.

We ordered fish Mandarin and pepper chicken. Fish mandarin was quite good but the chicken preparation was not upto the mark. Besides, service looked really sluggish as if we were not welcome there.

Giving 3.0 rating based on my personal experience.

I was never aware on the existence of this restaurant until few days back. I would say.. it's the only place after Oly Pub which serves cheap liquor.

Though the service is a bit disappointing, but the food isn't bad.

Food - 4.5/5

A few minutes of walking distance from parkstret metro station.
Silent ambience to gossip and hangout with buddies.
If you really don't care to go by its social reviews, then do come and visit here once.
Not only for its extended bar menus but also for its delicious food items.
And yes it's not so costly.

Like olypub this is a bar cum restaurant . Silver grill has been an old hangout zone for college students and after office crowd for well over the years . The cheap prices of alchoholic drinks and classic cocktails are the main reason for this place being crowded . The interior decoration is pretty ordinary . They serve drinks much faster than they serve food and that can be a curse if you are hungry
Overall its an average place to eat and drink :-)

It's essentially a bar where you would have to wait for a long while, in our case nearly an hour, for the food to arrive. But if you enjoy pork and are patient enough, it's worth the wait. The meat is flavoursome and melts in your mouth. Worth a one time visit

A bar  come restaurant situated at the heart of park street. The place craters mainly to the office gooding crowd. The decor is decent and service is good. The old waiter serving us was really warm and prompt. 
Drinks are priced reasonably .There are some four cocktails in offer all priced at 150( though my favourite bloody mary was not available). 
Coming to food, we ordered some 3 pork and 2 chicken dishes. The best were  roasted chilly pork and dry chicken....

Shaddy to it's core. Ladies please don't go alone. The main attraction is chilli pork and they make it really well. Alcohol prices are low. Please check your bill before paying coz the staff members goof up most of the times (personal experience ). 
They take a lot of time to serve the food.
If you are sitting upstairs...then tgere will only be one waiter and you will be half dead placing your order or asking for anything.
If you are in a group...u tend to enjoy all places. At times it all about good company.
So not a very good restaurant unless u don't care about the place but just want a cheap place to get drunk.

Worst experience I have ever had. From d√©cor  to service to food everything was substandard. I went there with my family once on new year. Even though it was evening and the roads were full of people, this restaurant stayed empty which does say a lot about its reputation.  The d√©cor was negligible. Nothing caught my fancy. Don't know why but it had a damp atmosphere. The service was very slow. We had to wait quite a while even though we were the only ones there barring two love-birds. We had ordered American Chopsuey, Chicken Prawn Chow. In addition, my aunt ordered Vodka and soda for herself. After waiting for a long time, when they finally served us, we found they had served 4sodas..even though we had clearly ordered one. We protested. But the waiter was very rude and went to fetch the Manager. Even he too sided with the waiter and ultimately we had to pay for 4sodas. Coming to the food, it was disgusting to say the least. The American Chopsuey tasted like a bunch of 'kotkoti's dipped in sauce with no flavour whatsoever. The Chicken Prawn Chow was no better. It did not have enough Chicken and Prawn. It was completely tasteless. It was a very bad experience. One doesn't expect such callous behaviour from a restaurant of 'Park Street'. I wish I never have to go back again.

Usually people end up going here when all other options around Park Street area don't work out OR if you actually want to sit in a place which gives those cheap bar vibes. üòÇ I fall in the latter category. This place is real shady. Pork dishes are decent and there's something called Golden Chicken which tastes okay. Alcohol is not expensive here so it is ideally a place where you should go to drink ( without any expectation of good ambience and music) The staff seems to be the same ones of the colonial area. I almost felt guilty making him (one of the oldest) walk to and fro from the table for placing my order. üòõ The manager doesn't give a damn as to what's happening and there's a tiny TV in the downstairs seating area which boasts cheap hindi movies. So, probably it's I don't give a F**K attitude has made it sustain amongst the biggies like Peter cat, mocambo and barbq all situated at such close proximity. Very different experience. üòÇ If you do end up going here, please go in a group of friends for getting sloshed. NOT a place where you go on dates or family dinners.

A place in Park Street where you can limit your wallet damage a wee bit! Beer and hard drinks are priced steadily and they do offer some good pork dishes and is more of a Chinese cuisine spot. However, what they lack is the consistency in taste which for me defines the food at any place. The same dish may taste different on different days and that for me is disappointing to a great degree. Their Crispy Pork in Hot Chilli Paste is a winner with beer. It is a good place just to go out with your bromantic buddies! Have some beer and food with conversations ranging from UEFA Champions League to relationships and crushes Lol!

Good place for drinking on weekdays. The hustle bustle is not felt. You can keep to yourself and drink among your company.
Staff is courteous, but food is not that great.
Choice of beer is generally very limited.

Food is ordinary Chinese, nothing to brag about, typical food to munch on with drinks. It has this really old look because it is really that old. One of the items on the menu is Pork Chilli which was pretty good to taste. My stomach was in a bad shape after the meal I had here, not sure whether it was some allergy or the food. Service was good and prompt.

As much as I would love to write up a good review about this place, I can't. Over the years it has steadily gone down hill and barring the cheap booze everything else is very blah. The place has potential given the fact that it has such a reputation and location, if only they tried a tad bit harder.

Id like to specially mention the staff members who are very soft spoken and patient.

Visited Silver grill for the first time yesterday. 

Food : Below average. Noodles, baby corn chilli etc.. Were way too oily. 

Ambience : Below average. Looks like age old conventional restaurants. 

Serving time and quality : serving time was about 30 mins (though there were hardly few customers in the restaurant) and the decorum of serving food was shitty. 

Price : comparatively cheap than other restaurants nearby.

I found a hair in my drink. When I requested that they change it they looked pissed off and went away with my drink. They did not apologize once and replaced it very reluctantly. The quantity of the new drink was less than the first glass so I don't even know if it was a fresh glass or they just poured away the part with the hair.

Great little place on park street serving good Chinese food. Indian Chinese of course. Plus the beers are priced reasonably here. 
The ambience has an old cabaret bar feel to it with the little chandelier and the red  and if the owner cleant up the place a bit he could really capitalize on the look and feel along with the location. Maybe they are already rolling in the dough.
The waiters were prompt and did a good job getting my orders and they came up pretty quick. The food isn't something to rave about but was good enough. Overall they are reasonably priced too.

This used to be my regular haunt last year because it is not only nearby my college but is probably the most pocket friendly restaurant in the Park Street area.
There is nothing flashy or impressive about the interiors - quite plainly done with mellow yellow lights. But that aside, if you are looking to gorge upon good food and cheap liquor, here's your place. 
The Crispy Chilli Pork, Dry Chilli Chicken and the Roasted Pork are my favourites here. The other items on the menu are also pretty good. However, do not try cocktails or wine here!

This is by far one of the worst restaurants I have eaten in. Four of us boys went on a warm evening looking for a couple of cold pints each. 
While we had our beers we realized we were hungry as well. All of us were in the mood to consume a lot of pork.
We went for pork sweet and sour, chilly pork in hot chilly paste, roast pork slice and crispy pork in hot chilly paste with veg hakka noodles and veg fried rice.
It can be very safely said all of the items were really bad except the crispy pork which was indeed crispy and had a nice sweet and spicy flavour. 
Our waiter was really quick with serving the beers and the food. In fact he was so quick he once even spilled some beer while pouring. Once we were done with the food he tended to hurry us up despite the fact that all of us had half filled glasses in front of us. And it wasn't like people were queuing up outside.
The ac wasn't working and fortunately there was one of those old rickety pedestal fans near our table which we could switch on after which each of us had to raise our voices to hear each other speak.
I had once done a takeaway and the food was below average but not bad. This has sort of sealed the deal.
Never again.

There are names which are the hallmark of Parkstreet food culture and one of then is Silver Grill.During its hay days it was one of THE PLACES to dine. Over the years it has lost its shine,mainly due to lack to upgradation on its part. Their food quality still has real good class alongside the price tags being not over top.¬†

Service wise there are real good,as they actually remember their loyal clientele by face and names,alongside also the alcohol rates are pretty reasonable too.What it definitely needs is a new upgraded menu along with new decor.We went for ¬†Clear chicken soup,Chicken asparagus soup along with dry chilli chicken.

The clear chicken soup was nicely made up ,the chicken asparagus soup had the right mix of asparagus along with chicken shreds in good quantity alongside the dry chilli chicken struck the tangy spicy tone that it needs too.

Nothing beats a classic and thus,even though this place has lost a bit of its shine still is worth its weight in gold.

This restaurant is located right beside flury's. A lovely place to catch up with friends over beer and finger food (that's hat we do there). The pocket pinch is comparatively lower than other restaurants in this region. Last time we ordered their tuborg and ultra max beer from drinks and from food we tried their chicken hakka noodles which was good in taste and the quantity was decent too, fried chilly chicken was okayish, chilly pork in hot chilly sauce paste tasted good and crispy chilly pork in hot chilly paste was the best and tasted amazing. The interior is not worth complimenting. Staff management is good too. :)

Location:Park street area beside flury's.

This is one of the cheapest places in this area,frequented by regular goers.The price of the drinks in comparison with other restaurants in the vicinity is quite cheap.
If you're looking for starters & sides you can try the pork preparations.
This is strictly not a place to visit with family & is a bar mainly.If you're visiting with friends try the upstairs.
Visited many times & would visit once again.

But Park Street bars are NOT FUN,they don't ALLOW SMOKING, NOT A SINGLE BAR/PUB, and its been like this since like the last century! Go for other places like Esplanade and such,don't even think of Park Street if you find it stupid to not smoke while drinking(like me:))!!! P.s. Starters ARE HORRIBLE here haha

The place is quite old and hold nostalgic values. But I feel they are a bit overpriced keeping in mind their quality of food. The quantity however is not bad.

Beside one step up this little restaurant is situated. Both the main course food and side dishes comes in large amount. And the prices are also reasonable. Alcohol prices are cheaper than other restaurants in park street. What they have to improve is the interior. Else it is nice place.

Quantity and quality are sufficient with respect to its cost. Also drinks are relatively cheaper than other bars at Park Street, ambiance is good. But the interior portion needs a little improvement.

Been here twice. The fisrt time we were in a hurry so had taken 1-2 pegs of whisky along with chilly chicken dry. Second time along with the drinks we had ordered Crispy Chicken and Fried Spring Chicken. Crispy chicken was nothing like I had eaten before hundreds of times at other places.. It was big 5-6 pieces of deep fried chicken with bones. Spring chicken was undercooked. It was a bad food experience.

We, a group of 13 people, landed up here as Olypub, which is directly opposite, was filled with people and an Uncle suggested us this place. Nothing exciting. The decor of the place is nothing to talk about. But the staff was welcoming and accepted our requested of joining three tables together. The place is known for the cheap alcohol that it provides. A typical Kolkata watering hole. The menu has quite a spread, but order according to your needs and stick to the basics and don't venture much.¬†

For food, we had ordered :¬†
1. Chicken Chilly
2. Prawn Masala
3. Paneer Tikka
4. Mushroom Masala

Decent taste. Since we were the only ones in this place, we could let our hair down more and the crew was very accommodating in that regard and also offered a discount. The place is good if you are hard on cash and you and your friends want to have a nice get together in Park Street. Only in that case, do venture out here.

This place used to be my favorite when I was little... But the quality has detoriated like anything...
From starters to main course, to the quality of rice used and also the quality of meat used is beyond your imagination...
Everything had an unpleasant smell...

Located almost opposite to a popular and pocket friendly pub, this one doesn't recieve the same amount of footfall. Its a pretty descent and ordinary place to have a few beers or hang out with friends that wont burn a hole in your pocket. Service was good. Finger food was quite good to my surprise! Overall a good option to spend an evening in park street.

We went to this place last Christmas. We had a party of six people and were seated in the upstairs section of the place. The decor was drab with white sheets covering the sofas.

We ordered a few drinks and Pork roast slice and Chilly chicken boneless for starters. The food was OK. But the service was sluggish to say the least. We had to ask for refills of the drinks for a few times before they finally arrived.

Not a place I'd recommend.

This is one of those favourable hangouts for tipplers in and around Park Street..I have spend quite a few evening here with friends over economically priced alcohols..they do have a good stock for popular brands and the food served here seems to be quite delicious and pocket friendly to go with your booze..However off late they have heavily increased the rates for both their food and booze..also the quality and quantity of the dishes served have gone south..Coming to ambiance they have two floors..the ambiance is pretty average..kind of sleazy and they have some hygeine issues at this place..The servers are seasoned,so if u r regular they knows exactly what satisfies you..Some of the better itmes to try out here are:
Roast Chilli Pork: It was way full of fat..tasted decent enough..
Fried Chilli Chicken: It was better..but one issue is all the items are way too oily..
Thai Fish: One of their signature dishes..spicy and tangy..taste good..
Last time our total cheque for 6 large pegs of Blender's Pride alongwith starters and main course came to Rs.2200/-..SO a word of caution this place isn't economical anymore as it used to be..

Located beside One Step Up, this is another hot spot for drinking at a budget in Park Street among my friends. But my maiden visit to this place was disappointing. I was there on a weekday evening at the entire place was empty.¬†

We ordered for a pepper chicken, a few drinks and mixed noodles. The food is extremely oily. While the chicken was not impressive at all, the noodles was average but had generous amount of chicken/shrimps.¬†

The ambiance is pretty worn out and basic. Also the prices are at par with Oly pub where the food is much better. Overall I was not very happy with the experience and dont think I will return.

Located at a nook in Park street, this place was at a certain time one of my father's favorite restaurant in his bachelor days. He used to go there to get his fair share of pocket-friendly old monk and we have been nearing stories about how he went there almost everyday... So, out of curiosity, we along with a family friend visited the place...
Upon entering, I understood why the place has an appeal to bachelors. It's like those shabby yet cosy places where you can booze and nobody judges you for the number of glasses in front of you. That's the ground floor, while the second floor is whe the waiters and the manager insist upon parties with ladies to sit and so after a quick glance at the ground floor with half the tables full of men, with mostly glasses in front rather than food, we went up to the next floor which was empty (probably due to the fact that there was an earthquake)¬†
The upper floor was a charming place. And people like me who are more old school instead of preferring glitter and flashy decor, found the dim lights quite soothing despite what the previous reviewers say.¬†
We ordered...
For starters- the famous Chili Pork dish which lived uptown its expectations. It's a dish straight outta heaven. The points might be awarded for this dish alone.
Pepper chicken- which I gladly can say wasn't a bummer after the pork and maintained the quality.
After the beverage and alcohol and starters, we were too full for a wholesome dinner and hence ordered a chicken corn soup which was light and nice.
A plate of chicken noodles which was the lowest point of the food, but not that bad as it sounds and a chili chicken plate which was absolutely fantastic.
The alcohol is affordable too.
The staff was courteous and friendly and helped us with good suggestions.
It's surprisingly hassle-free for a pocket-friendly drink joint (which it actually is thought to be). There were no untoward incidents and we managed to dine quite peacefully, contrary to our previous fears.

On the whole, recommended if you can get past the fact that the ground floor is for people who just wanna drink out their stress. Highly recommended, if you just wanna drink out your stress.

Average service, average food (the noodles may taste and look like the one from a local fast food stall), the exception probably being the chilly pork. On the upside, it is less crowded. Ideal for people with low budget.

If you are looking for typical Park Street ambiance and service with your family, this is not the place for you.

But then if you have ample time and want to spend a evening with drinks and snacks at a very cheap price, Silver Grill is the place for you. I love their Roast Pork slice as well their Chilly Pork. ¬†It is one of the few available joints at Kolkata which serves these pork dishes with drinks at a reasonable price.

Unlike other popular drinks joint of Park Street area, the place is not crowded and that is what I love about the place. Of course decor and speed of service are not at par with other similar ¬†joints , but it is not noisy at well. Unlike many reviewers, I never had any problem with the waiters. ¬†

A nice place to hang out with old friends over drinks and snacks ( especially Pork) in the evening in Park Street Area.

In our childhood and early youth, Park Street used to be the food and fashion street in Kolkata. that is, before the rise of different shopping malls. And I still remember going to the park street area with dad and choosing which restaurant we would dine in. Later, the company became that of friends and that too on a tight budget. Times have changed and so did we. This time, I was looking for a chinese restaurant in Park Street which is not crowded (unlike the famous one)- Waldorf is out of the league now (sadly) and the next choice was Silver Grill- the pocket friendly old-world chinese joint.

How to go:

Silver Grill is extremely easy to locate. Get on park street and go towards flurys. the next or the second next shop from Flury‚Äôs towards Park hotel, on the same footpath as Flury‚Äôs, is Silver Grill. There is this small door in the busy road. Open that and you find an almost empty restaurant (surprisingly, I‚Äôve hardly seen it packed up during lunch). Get in and take a rest from the hullabaloo of the street outside.

Ambience:¬†

The AC is strong, sofas are comfortable, They‚Äôve seen better days though and an old-world laziness prevails in the entire restaurant, which I personally love. You find an aged gentleman handing you the menu card and beverage card, who never seems to be in a hurry. You take your time and order for your choice. Price is reasonable, so don‚Äôt worry.

Food:

Beer is chilled there and they have a good variety of Indian brands. We ordered for Tuborg and along with it, a nice bowl of chanachur arrived (which was replenished regularly) and we immediately dived into our conversation- no hurry whatsoever. These guys still serve beer in beer mugs- love that.

¬†Along with it, came the fish finger with tarter sauce. Unlike some biiiiiig brands, these guys thankfully used betki fish in the fish finger and that had made all the difference. Ther are 6 big pieces of fish fingers a portion, some finger chips (locally made, not the McD types) and a large portion of tarter sauce (replenished a no extra charge).¬†

¬†As the main course, we ordered 1 portion each for a noodles, a fish dish (we got confidence from the fish finger and a pork dish). The portion size is quite filling is 2 portions are good for sharing among 3 heavy-eaters.¬†

Regarding ordering a noddles dish in restaurant, I mostly order the gravy noodles variety. Somehow, I have a mindset, the hakka variety is made better (at least same) in any roadside joint at fraction of a cost of a big restaurant and hence I intend to avoid it. But, this is a purely personal thinking. Silver Grill gave us their special mixed gravy noodles, which is one hell of a dish. Being a bong, I prefer a noodles where the meat portion dominates the noodles quantity and here it was. With every bite, we had some meat in mouth and heaven was ours. Love this dish‚Ä¶..

¬†We teamed it up with Singapore Fish (as suggested by the waiter) and definitely a Dry Roast Chilly Pork. Both were brilliant. The fish dish had around 8-10 pieces of succulent fish pieces with perfect balance of spice. But, being a pork lover, the dish of the day for me was the Dry Roast Chilly Pork. It was dry, non-greasy-lean pork meat tossed with onion, little capsicum and lots of chilly. It was heaven. God bless these resauranteurs who still prepare pork in Kolkata.¬†

Off and full we were, And didn‚Äôt wuite get when these 3 hours have passed. The bill was miniscule (around 1100/- with drinks), but then again when could money buy happiness ?¬†

A definite come-again-affair‚Ä¶.

If one is looking for an empty restaurant for that college gang nostalgic reunion or a quite lunch with your significant one (other than wife‚Ä¶..) come down, locate this old door and get in. You won‚Äôt regret. For records, they have a family section at first floor, which doubles up as a party venue (which can be booked for small gatherings), but the ground floor is not that bad either. 

Bon Apetite !!!

A few days back a couple of friends and myself were extremely low on budget and we were looking for a place where we could get drinks for cheap.We decided to try out this place located in Park street opposite Oly pub and beside One Step up.

This place is one of the least popular places in Park street and there are reasons behind it as we found out rather uncerimoniously.The ambience and decor of the place is decent but it is dimly lit and a bit on the shabbier side.The cleanliness and hygiene and overall maintenance I must say was pretty poor.

Coming to the food,we ordered a chilly pork,crispy chilly pork,dry chilly chicken and a chicken chowmein to go with a few drinks.The food was pretty average overall apart from the crispy chilly pork which was quite good.It was tasty and the pork contained the right mix of lean meat and fat.The drinks menu was pretty limited but yes quite cheap I must say.

The service was very poor.The waiters seemed reluctant to serve and it seemed as if they were doing us a favour by serving us.The prices were cheap and that was the only positive thing about the place.

Now,the worst part.One of the glasses of drinks we were served actually contained an insect! And astonishingly enough the waiter did not want to replace that particular glass and we had to argue with him and the manager to get it replaced! It was truly one of the worst experiences I have had anywhere.Then to add to this all one of my friends suffered a bout of food poisoning the next day.

Overall the only plus to this place is the cheap prices but the quality and the basic staff courtesy is so poor that I am surely not visiting this place ever again.

Silver Grill would be a place for casual dining to me. That's the place you would not decide to go before stepping out but if you have a group and want to find anyplace to sit and catch up, you can come here. 1st floor is specially for the ladies and people with them.

Prices are not high and since it's an Chinese/North Indian restaurant, you will get many options to choose from.

My favorite would be crispy chili pork though.. No offence!! :)

The service was very poor.The waiters seemed reluctant to serve and it seemed as if they were doing us a favour by serving us.The prices were cheap and that was the only positive thing about the place.

Now,the worst part.One of the glasses of drinks we were served actually contained an insect! And astonishingly enough the waiter did not want to replace that particular glass and we had to argue with him and the manager to get it replaced! It was truly one of the worst experiences I have had anywhere.Then to add to this all one of my friends suffered a bout of food poisoning the next day.

Overall the only plus to this place is the cheap prices but the quality and the basic staff courtesy is so poor that I am surely not visiting this place ever again.

Silver Grill would be a place for casual dining to me. That's the place you would not decide to go before stepping out but if you have a group and want to find anyplace to sit and catch up, you can come here. 1st floor is specially for the ladies and people with them.

Prices are not high and since it's an Chinese/North Indian restaurant, you will get many options to choose from.

My favorite would be crispy chili pork though.. No offence!! :)

Never go to this pub. WARNING! Costs are high. Ambience is too bad. Instead, go for Olypub. Its way better.¬†
And you cannot get a peg of beer.

on the pre christmas day last year we went @ park street. & when we reached there everywhere else was full(of our choice)..
so we decided to go there for our diner.
food were average except the mixed american chopsuey.It was very tasty n quantity was also great.
I loved it.
but other than this chopsuey, the starters n noodles were not so interesting.ok ok type..
interior decor was average..
hospitality was good.

Good food. Drinks is cheaper comparable to other restaurants of park street but be prepared for late service. Ambience is moderate. Went there for the second time with a friend of mine. Tried roast pork, chilli chicken, fish finger and mixed Cantonese noodles. Roast pork was delicious and the fish finger was soft and well fried. Mixed noodles was also good but the chilli chicken was a disappointment. We had 7.5 pegs of antiquity blue along with these dishes which costed us 3k.

me and my friends have been frequenting this place for a few months now and it is a good place to step in on a saturday night, pre club for a few drinks and snacks. the food is decent, and the drinks are reasonable. 
BUT, the reason for my low score is the fact the the waiters are extremely rude, and despite frequenting the place, this hasnt changed. unfortunate.

I like this place because of two reasons. Drinks are cheap. And their roast chilli pork is really tasty ( I always order with less fat). 

I have tried some other snacks too, but they are below average. This place is filled with office crowd on weekdays. Weekends are empty. 

This place is ok. But better alternatives available in the form of Starlit and Olypub.

The alcohol is cheap which makes it a good place for a night out with a big group of friends. The fish fingers, chilly pork and crispy baby corn are nice enough but I wouldnt recommend this place if youre looking for great quality food. It's just a great location if you want to drink a lot without paying too much but do not go here for a first date. Also, the ladies restroom is kinda nasty with no toilet paper and most of the times there's no hand soap either!

Silver grill is located right in the middle of Park Street. I was advised t go here by a Xavierite friend. Silver grill disappointed me a little on the service. There were a lot of empty tables and a few regulars were sitting on their usual tables. The chilly chiken was very nice but the french fries were average. the ketchup was not good either. The thing that worked for me was the alcohol rates and the chanachur. Maybe its more busy in the afternoons.

The Silver Grill has been really popular among the Youth mainly cause of its low cost booze. The food here is Okay. While some dishes are really good, some are not worth the price at all. 
 We were greeted well but when we wanted to clarify the differences between dishes, nobody could answer or tell us what the difference was. The interiors are okay. The place is really old but there's no harm in that. This place goes a bit light on the pocket compared to other places on park street. All in all it's a decent place but don't have high expectations when you're visiting here.

I've read several negative reviews of Silver Grill, and I must say I beg to differ. Silver Grill scores with us Xaverians on its sheer pocket-friendliness and proximity. Another major plus point is its openness to women customers - we girls have never once felt abashed there, neither have we been subjected to drunken scrutiny. The alcohol, of course, has an impressive range and is not too heavy on the pocket. I also, admittedly, like the chanachur that some reviewers have criticised - probably because I've never liked peanuts! The crispy potato, babycorn and pepper chicken are very spicy, very filling and the perfect accompaniment to the drinks. Add to that surprisingly homey red sofas and mostly efficient service, and you've got pretty good value for money. 
In my opinion, definitely one of the better watering-holes around.

Silver grill has been a popular restaurant among the college going students and home returning professionals working in that area because of it's amazingly priced low cost booze. The place is dimly lit and there's nothing special about the interiors except that the place is quite old so does the decor. Chairs and tables are very old and out of those few tables need repairing which I think they are least bothered about.

You can try their pepper chicken, dry chilli chicken and Singapore chicken. Pricing seems to be bit high as per the food quality is concerned. Service is not that good and need a lot of improvements. They will make you sit on any other table without even asking you while having food (my experience). I think this restaurant is struggling hard to stay at par with other modern bars and restaurant in that area as the competition has grown a lot.

STAY AWAY!

This has to be one of the worst, and definitely the most pretentious, drinking places I have ever had the misfortune of going to. On more than one occasion. And with each visit, the experience has gotten progressively worse. Firstly, Silver Grill is a "oh there's no getting space in Oly Pub tonight" place. Absolutely last resort. Secondly, the ambiance is terrible here. It's a very sidey joint, which is okay, no problem, but is hilarious in it's aspirations to come across as something better than what it is. (Lizards crawling on the walls, friendly roaches grazing past your foot, a heinous looking Santa Clause gaping at you from the wall during Christmas time, suspicious looking table cloths). Thirdly and most importantly, THE STAFF IS PATHETIC! THEY ARE COMICAL IN THEIR RUDENESS AND ABSOLUTELY SAD! Better waiters are found in roadside dhabas. And there's an especially annoying manager type person who acts smart, every single time. On our last visit, he flatly refused to serve us a bottle of beer. He said "Please don't come here and order 1 bottle of here...you have to order food." I obviously said I won't. Partly because the food here SUCKS and secondly because, well, me and my boyfriend did NOT want to eat! We wanted to have beer. That's all. The guy said "This is a diner, so you need to order food. Bollocks. Cheap place that it is, they were simply asking us to order more, in a (you guessed it right) exceptionally cheap way. So I said, give two bottles of beer. Immediately the whole grand illusion of it being a diner crumbled. The order was given to us. With a sidey little bowl of chanachur which tasted terrible. 

One of the worst drinking trips ever, after a hard day's work. Bad headache. The despondent faces of the waiters would have made us feel pity, but it did not. Why? Because even before we finished our first beer, the severely depressed looking waiter came up to us and handed us the bill. Whatever the hell, we smiled and inquired if we can finish the second bottle of beer after paying the bill. He nodded. We paid the bill. Then my boyfriend accidentally spilled some of his beer on the table. The waiter/manager/whathaveyou saw. Did not do anything. So we asked them to clean it. Which they then cleaned VERY RELUCTANTLY. And then the waiter waddles up to our table and places the brown money giving thingy and stares at us. I asked him "what?" and he waddled off again. He was expecting to be tipped. He did not get tipped. 

We somehow glugged down the second beer and ran out of that seedy little place, running down the creaky stairs towards the door. FREEDOM!

Never going back there. Ever. Previous experiences have been similarly terrible. Oh, also, the food and alcohol are overpriced. But even if they were being given for free, it would not redeem this place.

Yes, I agree that the place has deteriorated with time. Whenever I hear the name Silver Grill the first thing that comes to my mind is cheap liquor! And indeed it is that way. The best side dish on menu is chilly sliced pork. I have been to place more than twenty times perhaps, and this is perhaps the best place for mens-only groups. Pocket friendly bar in Park Street. Also try out mushrooms and gravy chowmein.

Such a poor performance on the heart of park street beside flury's  ........... starting from starters to mail course all are terribly
disappointing(road side stuffs are better at least they wont cheat you regarding the price/quality  lol)..  stink inking ambiance ... 
now there;s added embarrassment .. extremely ignorant and ill-mannered waiters /stale tables you have to call up for service assistance to remove the piled dirt
only tipplers may find it okhay.. in the stag section ..but again considering the ambiance and smelly  decor the alcohol is also over priced.. i personally don't think they are going to improve on the standard scale
NB:  JUST MIGHT SPOIL YOUR DINNING MOOD ;-)

The restaurant has gone down pethatically. I have visted silver grill on two occasions when my father in law took me there on his birthday. The place has a stinky smell about it on the room upstair. The restaurant definitely needs to improve its standards by and large in all departments, be it the food, the service, the interiors, etc. It is not what silver grill use to be a decade ago. 
The breakfast use to be good of silver grill that too has gone down badly.

Good place to dink Red Wine. Side dishes are enough but main dishes like mixed Fried rice are not good in term of quantity. Staffs are very good. I was there with my gf, while eating one junior staff asked me to take our snap very politely although he was not very efficient to use my Phone but took some very good snap and smiling.  My gf was also felt very happy by his nature. A place to visit time after time since it's very very pocket friendly.

with almost all restaurants of park street being jam packed on an afternoon during the pujas and with stomachs screaming out for food we had no choice than to visit this place which we preferably wouldn't otherwise at the first go
however quite surprisingly the ambience was not that bad as we were expecting it to be. in fact i was quite surprised to see that it was almost empty with only a handful of customers and the staffs being in a quite relaxing mood and watching tv which pretty soon made me unsure about the quality of their food
however, the day being a dry day we ordered for fresh lime sodas while waiting for the food to arrive.. 
the fresh lime sodas indeed refreshed us instantly but soon we got tired waiting for the food! the food took ages to arrive which is the exact thing you wouldn't want when you are hungry
we ordered roast pork slice.. which was cooked quite perfectly and the taste was good but i have had much tastier roast pork slice elsewhere
however the pork fat which was also served along with it was something i would not want being served
coming to the noodles & rice- tastes nothing extraordinary. when you are immensely hungry you will gulp down everything without much judging its taste
the only thing that hit me was the ingredients in them like the prawns and chicken were not sauteed with proper seasoning, they were simply blanched
the lemon chicken was way too honeyed for my palate
the fish with oyster sauce- at first i wasn't sure whether there's any fish at all or whether its just plain flour! but surprisingly there was fish finely sliced which was very soft.. the gravy tasted good
the quantity is quite filling
price-reasonable
i would not say the food was great it was okay! service is poor
ambience is good

Silver Grill once was one of the top draws of Park Street before it got drowned under the lights and sounds of ever improving food revolution around it. However this place has managed to hold onto a certain reputation among its regulars which still makes it a crowd puller during the festivals. The price level is pretty decent and food with alcohol for three would come around Rs 1200. Mostly, a nice place to hang out with friends after a long week and have a decent meal and long chat session. And, if you are lucky, you can see some local celebs sharing the table next to you, so keep your eyes open..!!! :)

Siver grill  ......  well  the name  is or  was  synonimous with  good  alcohol  once  upon  a  time  ...  i.e  around  2002-2007, after  that the place went down hill  ...  although  the  ambience  is quite decent  ( which  i must admit  )  ..  the same cannot be said about the  food quality  , infact all dishes are priced around rs 160 or above ,  fish dishes are even more costlier ...  in alcohol  try the HAIG 60 Ml  whiskey price at Rs  160 / 60 ml  peg  , other options are not that good  ....  in  food try the Fish items  ....  average  cost  for  two  would  be  750  Rs  to  be  more realistic......
