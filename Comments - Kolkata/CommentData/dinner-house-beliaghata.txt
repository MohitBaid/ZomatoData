We ordered a Murg Musallam,it was delicious. The price is Rs.450 but,if you want to order that you'll have to wait for an hour. The gravy was awesome with cashews and raisins in it. The place is small but,still can accommodate quite some. The staffs are nice and friendly. And the ambiance is decent. The prices of other dishes are reasonable. Previously I had chicken rolls, biriyani and chicken tandoori from this place which were delicious too.

We go there two weeks back for dinner. It's situated opposite of beleghata P.S. It's a small outlet‚Äã capacity of 25-30 people. We ordered butter nan, paneer butter masala, chicken afgani masala, fish hariyali masala n firni. Quantity n quality is ok type except firni. Whatever it was can't call it firni at least. Decoration is very simple. It's an‚Äã a.c restaurant but a.c was not working so that was a suffocating atmosphere because there was no fan as well. After telling them d matter several times they arranged a pedestal.

Dinner House is situated at Beliaghata CIT More, opposite the Police Station. The eatery has been refurbished and reopened under a new management.
Kudos to them, for the delicious food they serve at surprisingly low prices, without GST so far!
Personally I love their North Indian gravy items with butter naan or rumali roti. They can improve on the Chinese dishes, which are not bad either.
Dinner House has grown popular in my locality for their speedy home delivery and discount offers on rolls... üëçüëçüëç

Well, more than 30 years of residence in the Phoolbagan neighbourhood, but was still unaware of this gem of a place named Dinner house at Beliaghata, just a km or two away!

Some pulao was made at home, devoid of any main course, hence, went for a home delivery of the below items from this place:-

(i)	Dal makhani

(ii)	Paneer butter masala

(iii)	Phirni

While placing the order, little did I know that I was about to have one of the best dinner experiences of my life. Delivery was done in some 35 ‚Äì 40 minutes, which is pretty commendable ‚Äì considering the monsoon!

Both the main course were outstanding, the dal deserving a special mention ‚Äì especially, when it contains lots of fox seeds!

Both the main course had a pinch of sweetness ‚Äì just perfectly optimum ‚Äì neither high, nor low.

Both the main course were perfect on taste, although, I feel that presentation could have been better!

Both the main course went so perfect with the home-cooked pulao that we relished each and every morsel of the food!

And, since we all love happy endings, the phirni was the best I ever had ‚Äì may be it was prepared by God himself. Forget Arsalan, forget Aminia ‚Äì come to Dinner house ‚Äì and relish the heavenly phirni!

USP of the place:-

(a)	They don‚Äôt charge a single penny for packing, nor for home delivery!

(b)	They serve generous quantum of food.

(c)	Taste is out of the world!

(d)	Delivery is swift

(e)	Prices are not reasonable, but pretty low ‚Äì considering what they serve!

A warm hug to the management and of course, to the chef for serving happiness to us on a food platter! I am now planning a dine-in shortly to this place!

VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
