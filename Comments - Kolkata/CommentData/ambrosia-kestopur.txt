Nice ambience ; a quaint A.C chinese restaurant. Service is a little slow but that could be because we went in the afternoon. Nevertheless it gives some time and there is no rush so that is a good thing for people looking forward to connecting over some good chinese food. The chilli chicken and garlic chicken preparation are a must try. The quantity of the food is sufficient and price is very reasonable. One plate of mixed fried rice and one plate of garlic pepper chicken cost around 285/-Rs. and was enough for two people. Definitely a place to visit for the peace loving population who still prefers the old fashioned conversation and good food.

Located right on the keshtopur auto stand and can be seen from VIP road. Have been there a couple of times and was not more or less satisfied with the food. The only thing is that their management team is not at all professional. Needs to work on their interior and cutleries as well.

A mediocre but ac restaurant.
Food quality is ok.. n quite pocket friendly.
We ordered chkn biriyany.... Roti n daal makhani.
Quantity was good.
They need to do better in respect to hygine n cleanliness.
The glasses n jugs had marks.. n dint look very clean.
The washroom was also not clean & leaking water from the toilet pan.

Without any proper advertisements this place flourished quite well and they are doing great for a long time. This may not be a 3-star or so restaurant but their food can compete anyone, anytime. Ambrosia is ideal for friends' hangout and family dinner equally. My Mom took me there first time and after that I personally recommended many people. They have take-away and home-delivery facilities also. We even ordered on 31st December once. In spite of heavy rush and bulk serving, they delivered our food just on time and hot. The behavior of the owner-manager and the waiters are very polite and nice. I visited them many times and I got food readily served always. I am very happy with their service.

If you just want to eat, or better, take away, this place is good. Decorations or "dining experience" does make sense. I had chicken drums of heaven and dry chilly chicken with more coating than chicken....the biriyani and kadai mutton is decent with good portions and quantity.

Just another place for a casual visit. Was here yesterday for the first time with my friends for an evening snack. Nothing much to say. Decor is simple. Food is average. We tried chinese. If not good,it wasn't bad also. Especially the chicken chilli garlic noodles was good. Their service is a bit on the poor side I must say. Took a long time & also the way the waiter served the food was disapproving.

Located on the right hand side as u just enter the main road at kestopur from VIP road ...its one the better options if u r on a tight budget .... the thing with these local restuarants is that they serve average quality food at a very cheap rate ... with no expectation of ambience and other factors , u just look for basic requirements here like the AC , basic interiors(in terms of space,etc) and standard quality and quantity of food and stick to the basics while ordering items i.e not try out something experimental¬† :) .... in this category i would say ambrosia gives a tough competition to its other competitor like lords or the newly opened Al-Hayat in the same area ......... prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes ..thats what makes sure that u dont burn a hole in your pocket even after ordering a multitude of items .... serving time is quite less as well ..... maybe a smile and a bit of enthusiasm from the waiters would fill up its other deficiencies to some extent ....

So, let me start by saying that I hate giving bad reviews, My ability to look on the bright side is probably why this place is getting the rating that it is...
I have been there only once...Ambience is okay...
I remember we ordered Singaporean rice...Hunan chicken...mutton biryani..chicken kasa...The rice items were too dry to eat, and the chicken preparations were totally bland...we had to leave without eating anything...we just paid our bill and left the place...
Really wanted to like this place...My bad...

Well nothing great about the ambiance both inside and outside.
As you enter the place crossing the crowd of Kestopur, climbing the stairs if you get a place near the AC its fine, otherwise the chill inside is not same everywhere. If the restaurant is almost full you will feel the heat and suffocation inside.
Food is nothing great, they maintain food of average taste just as per the money they will charge you.
I guess there are much better places around , so just for a normal weekend hangout you can go here, but for special occasions--please do avoid.

Quality of Overall the experience is good...Word of caution:Don't expect a specialty restaurant treatment, you won't get one. No extravagant decor or food that will blow your mind.

The food is average, the service is not at all good, the place is small and I will have absolutely no time to add this to my never to eat again list. No specialty in any item, and the quality of the food served is not that great also. Just an average eatery where you'll eat anything you get and you pay for sitting in an air-conditioned room, and obviously the price of the raw food!
