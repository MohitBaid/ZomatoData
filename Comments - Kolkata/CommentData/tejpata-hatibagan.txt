When asked about the day's special, the lady sent me this snap. Got really interested immediately and ordered for 3 plates of it with a few more suitable options. It was great. Cannot put in words. Prawns so tender and flavour so strong. Will order again, very soon.

A stunning home delivery service of bengali soul and comfort foods. Very very hygienic and tasty with a twisty tale. Really impressed. Ditching all other bong joints and getting committed to this one. Love love love!

Had an awesome echorer torkari with gobindobhog chaaler bhat. Good quality. Very hygienic and swift. Moderately priced and moderately spicy. Value for money.

Ideal place to order bengali cuisine from. I thought that the price might be on the higher side. But was totally surprised when the food was delivered. Their bhoger khichuri and bishnubhog payesh were amazing. Tomato chutney is so flavourful. Just awesome.

So this is a new delivery counter near our house and managed by a very sweet and young lady. We ordered for curd rohu, chicken stew and pumpkin side. Chutney came complimentary. The curd rohu was really rich and creamy and on a sweet and sour side. I prefer it spicy though. But I could not just deny the taste. The quality of the fishes was really good. The chechki kumro was so tasty and the milk laden savoury chicken stew was one of the best stew dishes I have tasted so far. So light, so healthy and so tasty! One of the best places in kolkata to order from. This is my first review on zomato and this is just for them. The delivery boy was not very efficient, but I will just overlook that.

They have great care for their customers. That is what that strikes me the most. Nothing to say about the food. Only good things. I ordered doi katla, bashonti polau and mutton kosha. Each of the dishes were like signature dishes. Brilliant and flavourful. Not a very fond of spices so they kept it light for me as instructed. Very healthy and very tasty. Good job!

The most awesome Chingri malaikari I had in years. Being an almost non bong I am generally reluctant about bong foods. But Tejpata team changed my mind setup. Thank you! Keep it up. And also it was lovely to talk to Debby. She has some killer customer handling skills. Much love. Will order again.

It is a takeway/ delivery counter. No seat arrangements. The lady who manages is warm and polite. 

Coming to the food- 
We ordered silk zafrani mutton, bashonti mutton pulau, muri ghonto, fish fry and parshe shorshe. 

1. Silk mutton was very royal and elegant with all exotic spices.

2. Bashonti mutton pulao was very good. Mutton pieces were soft and fragrant with kesar.

3. Muri ghonto was so great that I did not even need rice for its accompaniment and even preserved it for midnight snacking. 

4. Fish fry :- o my god. Canâ€™t explain in words. You gotta taste that to understand how it tastes! It is completely extravagant! 

5. Parshe shorshe was tasty. The quality of the fish was to die for. 

Great going. Will order again soon. It is also a pleasure to communicate with Debby. She made sure that the food reaches on time and made things easier though the delivery area was a bit far away from their place.
