On the way of jadavpur police station. I always take away foods. Egg roll, crunchy fish fry, chili chicken are very delicious. Want to try more.

It's a takeaway cum roadside eatery.They also provide catering service.The food is average.In summer their menu had a drink which was named Blue Lagoon and it was quite refreshing.I personally liked it.
Vegetable Pulao,Veg Tardka and Matar Paneer is what i like here.What i like is the food that is served here is not very spicy or oily.On a whole food and service both are average.

This outlet is very close to a relative's place and whenever I go to their house, food from the Howrah Bridge is a must. Their Biriyani is really, really nice. It's light but full of flavours. Their Fish Fries are pretty good too, with the unique cornflake coating which actually gives it a wonderful texture. Their Fried Rice is a bit dry but the Chilli Fish is delectable. The rolls are average. Overall, it's perfect if people drop in suddenly and u are out of food, and for homely parties as well. They're quite reliable and their quality is pretty consistent if you know what to order!

Much filling, same great taste.

At this point the review us pretty much over. And the online above was public service announcement for all my ADHD friends looking through to catch a bite. If you would like to read, however, the review follows ..

I ordered a special mutton biryani, reshmi chicken masala and 2 rumali rotis. 

The biryani wasn't greasy and the meat was intimidating. The reshmi chicken masala had mild sauce that didn't overpower the rest of the meal. The rumali roti was soft and tender like my feelings. 

Now for the brickbats. The egg was overcooked and tough like 12th class calculus . The meat was fibrous and I doubt I can tick it off as a part of daily fiber requirement.

The whole package was delivered before time which is always nice to have happened to you and the surprise raita in the package. Although the amount of raita is mere pittance when it comes to the whole package, it is much appreciated. 

A solid 4.5 in my opinion or a 9 if it's out of 10. You do the math.

Ordered few items for supper from this place.Ordered yellow butter dal fry,chicken reshmi butter masala and chased it with some tandoori roti,butter naan and jeera rice.Talking about the food:- 
1)Tandoori Roti and Butter naan:-Soft and almost melted in mouth.
2)Yellow Butter dal fry:-Was so delicious that i had it without roti and started liking my fingers.
3)Jeera Rice:-Rice was fluffy,less greasy and I liked the fact that they put less jeera on it.
4)Chicken Reshmi butter masala:-Liked the gravy, it was mild and had a hint of cardamom flavour to it.The only flaw of the entire meal was the chicken morsels, it had a  chewy texture.

Located in the jadavpur Thana to avisikta stretch, this place stands on the main road just opposite to the spice of joy restaurant. Food quality and quantity is decent. Have been tasting their dishes for more than 7years. Almost had all the items from the menu. The Chinese is good here specially the fried rice and chowmein. Rolls and starters are delicious. This time I had mutton Biriyani..it was okay the mutton was well cooked and the biriyani comes with an egg and a potato. Cost about 150INR. Overall it is a satisfactory option to tame your hunger at a reasonable price.

This take away snacketeria is a popular venue for food lovers in Jadavpur Selimpore area. It has limited open air sitting,  but is more popular as a takeaway or delivery place. Food is yum,  and price is cheap. Highly recommended for a quick evening snack. 

My favorites are listed as follows: Egg Roll,  Chicken Roll,  Fish Fry, Chicken Fried Momo. 
You can also try their large variety of soups, Chowmin,  Fried Rice and Kebabs. I have seen many people go for American Chopsuey,  though I am yet to taste it. 

Dial Hiwrah Bridge for some finger licking snacks!

It is situated right on the main road between Jadavpur police station and Prince Anwar Shah connector!
The quantity is really filling and the food looks appetising too!
Although the place needs to turn their hygiene up a notch! That's why they missed out on a star from me!
The seating arrangement is not upto the mark because it's on the main road and there are several people and cars passing by all the time! This again coincides with hygiene and peaceful conversations! They just have 2 tables laid out on the footpath which accommodates 8 people in all! 

The food is sumptuous and the staff is really polite! 
Approximately, ₹500 for two!

They have a small restaurant behind their delivery outlet....Went on a Friday night,the cashier asked me to go the restaurant,while being there the security guard stopped  me telling the restaurant is booked for a private party,clearly something illegal was happening  inside with loud sound and smell of booze(they don't have a liquor license)....Came back to the delivery outlet,they asked me to sit on a plastic chair in footpath,then I thought of ordering jst a chicken roll,they told they don't have change for 500...Clearly this is shame for a restaurant...Won't ever visit or order from here via Swiggy...While coming back saw they are picking up some boiled rice from their floor which was spilled by accident to be put in Kadai...Surely shameful and disgraceful...Boycott Howrah Bridge

This place is basically close to Jadavpur police station. Take the road towards E.M. bypass from Jadavpur police station, cross the bridge and you'll reach this place. There's not much for ambiance because it is mainly a take away counter. You can go there by your car and park it over there and have food. There's no charge for parking. 
Coming to the food, the only thing which is not upto the mark is the biryani. Try anything else you won't be dissatisfied. The must tries are the fish fries(trust me they are good and award winning) kababs(preferably chicken), tandoori, reshmi butter masala, tikka butter masala, chicken lollipop, pan fried chilly chicken, paranthas(they are HUGE) and the fried rice. Or you can also order any of the rolls too. 
I've seen Howrah bridge grow as I stay nearby, I can assure you about the dishes that I've mentioned up there. If you ever visit here do try them.

Today My 1st Ever Visit To This Awesome Twosome Outlet The Howrah Bridge And After Looking The Scenario It Was Quite Cozy And Comfortable For Me To Locate In The Jadhavpur Area For The 1st Time. After I Scored A Brilliant 122 Runs In Just 54 Balls With My Friend Arnab De Me And He Had A Huge Partnership Ever Of 187 Runs In 66 Balls. Total We Scored 243 Runs In 15 Overs. And Our Opponent 40 All Out In 2.3 Overs. We Win The Match By 203 Runs. Man Of The Match Was Me. After That I Ordered 1 Plate Veg Chowmein For Just Rs. 90/- And I Certainly Tell This My Zomato Friends That Is The Day I Will Never Ever Forget. I Enjoyed Their Food And Thier Ambience Was Good With Their Hospitality. Great Atmosphere And Great Venue As Well. A Must Visit Place. Thank you Howrah Bridge For Making My Day Very Special. This Place Is Located Opposite Spice Of Joy, Jadhavpur.😄😄

Located near to Jadavpur thana on the Jadavpur- Avishikta connector, this is one of the pocket friendly take away counter that serves quality food. Love their mutton biriyani and afghani murg kebab which tastes awesome in addition to rolls. They do have limited number of seating arrangements in front of the eatery.

A classic example of an underrated food joint. Howrah bridge is near my home and it's a shame that I discovered the greatness of this place after so long

Although most of the food here is pretty nice, I absolutely love the fish fry. They fry it in cornflower I think and I have never tasted better fish fries in the town.

There is no AC and you may not get a place to sit and eat but it's a must try!!!!

A few days back,we planned for a small family dinner but we didnt really want to go out anywhere,so decided to order the food. We ordered 1 chicken biriyani,1 fried rice,2 masala kulcha,1 laccha paratha and 1 plate of chicken tandoor butter masala.

The biriyani and fried rice was good enough. The masala kulcha was also good to taste,and was nice and soft,however it was a bit too oily. The laccha paratha was ok ok,not anything great. But the chicken tandoor butter masala was just awesome,it contained 2 large succulent tandoor pieces in a really really hot and spicy gravy. So its good if you r wanting a spicy meaty maon course,good value for the amount charged. Overall,although not exquisite,yet a small and nice experience.

I ordered food from them through Zomato. The delivery experience was quite bad. First, out of the 5 items ordered, they did not have 2 - so I had to go for substitutions. Then, the delivery was quite late. The restaurant person called me after the due delivery time to ask for directions, and when I point out that it is already past the promised delivery time, he nonchalantly said the items will be ready soon.

As for the food, I tried veg kolhapuri, paneer butter masala and chicken bharta. The veg kolhapuri is okay tasting - no idea why it is called kolhapuri - it is not remotely like any kolhapuri dish I have had anywhere else. Chicken bharta was decent, paneer butter masala was average. All the dishes had way too much oil. The best part of the meal was rumali roti - which was very good. Quantity wise, they were pretty much like other places in this price range - three dishes shared between three people makes a filling meal.

Overall, the food would probably rate a mediocre 3.0, but I am deducting  half a star for the unprofessional attitude.

Some noteworthy items on their menu are the pan fried chilli chicken, crunchy fish fry, and the gravy chowmein, specifically the chicken one.

A small roadside shop on Avishikta, Kalikapur -  Jadavpur Thana connector.
I can't say foods are decent but compare to price quantity and quality is good.
Boti-kebab is one of their special item that you can obviously try. Small pieces of chicken specially prepared with lots of onion, capsicum, lemon and spices.
Other foods like Biriyani, Kebabs, tandur are also good. Actually I've tried their food multiple times and never got a food that made me feel that ohh this a waste.
One thing is that this is mainly a take away counter. Small areas are there for sit and take food but you may not consider that uncovered area beside a heavy traffic road.

Located near the Jadavpur Thana - Avishikta connector, this place started as a take away, until recently they opened up a restaurant behind their place. 

A stone's throw from my place. I have been a fan of their Indian and Chinese delicacies. I have had a pick up done from there many times. Yesterday, I got a Schezwan Noodles and Pan Fried chicken and both were to the point. The Schezwan Noodles had the right amount of chilli in it. And the Pan Fried Chicken was amazing even. The chicken was evenly coated and it managed to be sweet and sour at the same time which gave it the necessary punch in flavors. Earlier, I got some Masala Kulcha, Chicken Bharta and Butter and they were equally delicious. Yet to taste the Biryani over there. I did try out their Fish Fry and to be honest, I realised, why it featured on the list recommended by TOI.  

Can't comment over the decor as I have never been to their dine out. It has been my go to place for pick ups.

Worth visiting once and trying out their Fish Fry.

Good place for a quick bite just before the Selimpore Bridge towards Jadavpur thana. Food is tasty, moderately priced and well cooked. Try avoiding Sundays as it remains packed-up then!

Had passed by a number of times before finally ordering up for a take away some few days back ! I ordered Egg Tarka and Tandoori roti. The Egg tarka was diluted more than expected with a layer of butter floating over it which seemed repulsive to me at a fist glance. The taste was not upto the mark too. The rotis however were okay. Overall, not a satisfactory experience !

This take away joint is situated on the Jadavpur Avishikta connector. The place serves rolls, fries, as well as cinese and mughlai dishes. They unique fish fry featured in TOI, and even was judged to be one of the best. I found the fish fry rather mundane, the only exception being the KFC like coating. As for the food, this place is a bit steeply priced but taste  and quantity -wise it's good..

Just a walk away from home, this is a no-nonsense place! It offers Chinese and Indian/Mughlai cuisines and the dishes are quite decent in taste and flavour..!The menu is very vast with a variety of offerings! My favourite so far from them is their unique Mutton Pulav.. It is more of a North Indian rice dish (without that usual aromas of Calcutta biriyani) with small boneless pieces of mutton. Though the quantity of mutton can be more, the dish is quite tasty, especially because its flavour might take you back to some of the restaurants in Delhi NCR!!Even their Chinese dishes are fine but then, most restaurants in Calcutta serve similar tasting Indo-Chinese stuff!

Have been to this place sometime back,, been there with my family.We ordered plain naan,chicken reshmi butter masala,chicken bharta in main course and in starter we ordered chicken lollipop and fish finger. .The food is good  and a bit spicy. They have home delivery - but sometimes take quite a long time.The entrance is not as good as compared to others as it is a road side joint .No problem in parking a car . Overall nice place.

I have seen this restaurant multiple times as I am a frequently commute through the Anwar Shah connector but never actually dropped by. It was only last week that I happened to drop in (that too by chance). This is an interesting road side joint where you can just park you car or two-wheeler by the side of the road and grab on to some tasty dishes. Incidentally it was their birthday that day and they were offering a discount on the total menu bill (what a day to drop by..yay...). 

As soon as I parked my car on the road next to this restaurant, a face peeked through the window and asked what we would like to have. What followed next was an example of great service. Since it was the first time, I did not know the menu and he promptly produced the menu card from his pocket. While we were browsing through an extensive menu to decide what we would order, this guy went about attending other cars. I would see a row of cars and two-wheelers parked by the side of the road. 

The menu had almost everything starting from rolls, indian starters, biriyani, chicken-mutton-fish-prawn dishes, veggie dishes for vegetarians, tandoori to soups, chinese dishes. Being a bit cautious on the first day, this is what we ordered:

1. Chicken clear soup 

2. Fish Finger (6 pieces) 

3. Mixed chowmein (gravy) 

4. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala (for parcel)

While we were waiting, I noticed that there is just about 2 tables on the footpath with 4 chairs in each table for sitting. I gathered that their primary business is either from take-aways or more so from drive-in dining. There are very few food joints who actually run by this concept, very nice! 

The food arrived, with plates, spoon, fork, napkins et al, all in the car itself. The food was hot and tasty. 

Two days later, my aunt came to my Kalikapur apartment in the evening. We (me, my wife and my son) planned to watch a movie at Inox and Maa did not want to go for a 3 hours long movie. So the ladies chatted away together till we returned at 9:30pm. It was late and I decided to drop my aunt to her place at Golf Green. We were hungry and on the way we stopped at The Howrah Bridge. It was almost 9:45pm and yet there was line of vehicles in front of the restaurant. As I parked behind a Ertiga, the same person came over. 

This time, I was aware of the menu. So we decided to have the following:

1. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup 

2. Chicken Tandoori full(4 pieces) 

3. Mixed Chowmein (Hakka) 

4. Chicken tikka butter masala (parcel)

The taste of the items were really good. Especially the chicken tandoori pieces were large sized, nicely done and excellant in taste.I am surely going to have chicken tandoori once again at this place.

Overall, a nice food joint and a good service. Really enjoyed the food. Two things which can be reviewed or considered. Firstly, the time taken to prepare the dishes is a bit long. This is especially apparant when there are large number of orders that come in. We faced this on the second day and it becomes a bit boring sitting in the car waiting long for food. Secondly, I thought that the prices are on the higher side considering that this is road side joint. If this price was charged in a air-conditioned restaurant with moderate sitting arrangement, it would have been appropriate but for a road-side joint, they should reconsider the price tag. The food is anyways great which would make you come back for more.

My first official zomato review! 

So to begin with, I had ordered through foodpanda which was a breeze. My choice of food for dinner included jeera rice, fish curry, mutton chaap, crispy chili baby corn which also included a complimentary salad. the packaging was absolutely perfect and the food was hot at the time of delivery just as foodpanda portrays in their ad. 

The food tasted yum. the rice was fresh with the smell of ghee, the curries were pretty light without any excess oil, probably the area of improvement would be the baby corn, though it had the right mix of spices but they weren't crispy (as the name goes by). 

Overall i would recommend this place and myself would be looking forward in trying out the other items from their menu.

Budget take away. Typical Indian Chinese is what they cook. Cannot comment on the indian dishes as I have never ate those. Very common Indo-Chinese dishes hugely improvised to fit local taste buds but successfully. Quality is good; no stomach upset ever. Quantity is also value for money. Perfect when your daily cook is on an unplanned leave and you are lacking the energy to get into the kitchen.

Located on the Anwar Shah Road connector, just a few minutes from Selimpur Bypass, this place is a small joint, very well lit. I have had take-aways from this place, so I dont really have much idea about the sitting arrangement and the service. Mostly I took biriyanis, which is like decent in taste, quality and quantity also. The peas pulao is a bit on the sweeter side which actually i don't like normally. The kebabs were disappointing actually, I didn't find it good at all. So I would like you all hitting this place to avoid the kebabs. Otherwise this place is decent enough, not very expenaive and quite satisfying.

It's a small take-away cum outdoor seating joint. Its easy to locate and pocket friendly. Have been there quite a few times. It serves Indian as well as Chinese. The Indian hicken dishes are cheap as well as tasty. The mutton boti pulao is my personal favourite and one plate is adequate enough for two. The waiters are a little slow but considering the quality and quantity of food its a win-win.

Front eating out area is not adequate enuf so basically it serves as a take away joint.

Howrah Bridge is the busiest take away joint in my para. It is a tiny place with only two tables on the pavement for seating. People mostly sit for a few minutes while their orders are getting ready inside. Even the cashier sits on the pavement with his cash counter! 
I've tried only the Egg roll here and it was good. Devoid of any aloo tarkari inside (Alas! Gone are the days of Bedouin and Ratna Cabin), even the cucumbers scraped, what they serve has loads of onions and green chillies. Not bad, either. The minimum order for home delivery is 250 Rs within 2.5 km, anything farther would make it Rs 500. 

Since I'm a biriyani person, would come back with a detailed review once I try it there.

This review on Howrah bridge is specifically for tandoori and momos. 
The momos are tasty as compared to its price, though I must say the prices are a bit high but the taste and preparation will sweep off the disappointment on your wallet. My favorite was the tandoori chicken nicely prepared and packed and the best part is the home delivery facility that too on time. Good job guys, my orders for tandoor will always ring your phone every Friday.

A friend of mine had come over and suggested the place.....so  we went there and brought food home. We ordered malai kabab, chk. tikka kabab, naan, chicken bharta, chk.reshmi masala, chk tikka butter masala. Firstly we had to wait almiost an hour to get the food. The Malai Kabab was a disater....I dont know what they tried to make....chicken wrapped with omlet???, just tased a bite could not have any more. Tha chk tikka kabak was hard, small pieces and horrible to taste. the other items were also equally  baaaaad....really baaaad. Over all the food was so bad thet we dropped the idea of eating it.....could not take it anymore. Ordered pizzas from dominos which saved the day. This place was a sheer waste of money and time......paid Rs1500/- for the food which the maid servant took the next day. Hope she dose'nt quit the job after having that food.

Mostly a take away outlet, also doing delivery, howrah bridge serves both indian and chinese cuisine. I have ordered in many times at this place, from tandoori chicken,kebabs, chicken bharta, nans to special fried rice, scheczwan chicken, and the sorts. The menu is a typical fare consisting of all the known dishes. But they do it well, and comes at a reasonable price too. I find the indian dishes specially the chickwn bharta and tandoori to be a notch above the rest.
Another plus point is its open till 1130pm. Nice place to order in,in case of a house party.

I've been acquainted to this place from its onset so I practically know the menu outright and also the people but on an honest note, this one has deteriorated. 


The biriyani portions were great served with a free raita when it started with the special biriyani. Now the taste has become blunt for the average Indian palate and the biriyani itself a lot more soggy. 

The boti polao was my pick but now I find it a genuine wrecker for my senses. Getting too spicy. 

Still the achari kabab is amazing when taken fresh, very succulent, the lasooni kabab was even a better one for flavor but they seldom have it. 

The nan selection overall good with the masala kulcha standing out for a solo meal with something light. 


The disappointing part is the Chinese considering the neighbourhood. Very overpriced, very inclined to be Indian rather than Chinese considering the spice quotient.

A friend of mine lives by the Anwar Shah connector and orders from this place quite often. Yesterday, when I was at their place, we ordered a whole Tandoori Chicken and Reshmi Kebab. 

The delivery was rather prompt. The tandoori chicken is at par with some of the best known tandoori joints of the city. However the reshmi kebabs we not very reshmi, and a little too dry and tough for my liking. Also the green chutney that they serve with the kebabs was too less.

On another occasion, ordered their Butter Naan, Daal Makhani and Chicken Bharta. The Naan hardly had butter, but the other two dishes were very good indeed. Specially their bharta, (which has an egg too, yay!) Is what we all loved.

I was bowled over by 'Howrah Bridge's delicious starters and luscious kebabs. They are soft and boasts a fabulous garnish. One must try out the awesome 'Fish in Mustard Sauce'.You will surely lick your fingers once you dig into the Prawn items. A Thumps Up to the excellent service.

A small take away resturant on Anwar Shah Connector to EM Bypass. They still do not have a decent seating area, only option to sit and dine is only few plastic chairs on the pavement in front of it. So no recommendation for sit and dine.
But what I applaud about this resturant is their food. The indian as well as chinese food available is quite good. Biriyani is not the best of their menu - instead take some pulao and side dish. You will be quite happy with the quality of food. 
They have home delivery - but sometimes take quite a long time. 
Very much a value for money, sometimes I feel better value for money.
The kabab range is quite good.They also serve rolls.

Don't try their Biriyani it's avarage but specially like their tandoor dishes "Reshmi butter masala" (too good must try),"Mutton handi masala" and "Masala kulacha" (must try it has different taste). Kebabs are also tasty, specially named "Toofani kebab" it's good. Rolls are ok not that much good. Overall it's a good take away food shop at the Sahid Nagar area.
