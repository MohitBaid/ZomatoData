We often much rolls from this place and mostly when bawarchi is crowded.
The ambience looks really bad but taste wise it's good enough. (if you let go thinking about the quality of food,i.e)
Never clicked a pic! Will upload one soon!

Another option for biriyani at ajay nagar. It's simply a take away.  Biriyani tastes good and home made. I suggest u give it a try.. The portion of biriyani is a lot and will easily satisfy ure hunger

This one is better option than Siraz... it's a roadside little fast food joint, serves chinese too... I had there biriyani quite a few times... it's good but not excellent... also it's a pocket friendly option to... didn't try there chinese... nothing more to say about deco, staffs and service...

A roadside place.Offers food at cheap rates.
The biriyani is quite OK type. But the chicken is not that great . Otherwise rolls and pakoras are good enough. Go there if you terribly hungry are and left with no options.
Ohk thanks .

A roadside resturant so you cannot expect very much.Me with my friend went for biriyani on Dashami.I can say the biriyani is average but the fragnance of rose water is too much.The rice not cooked properly.So even if u r hungry u could try some other places nearby.

At Ajaynagar it is an roadside average place..they are mainly known for their biriyani..also serves pakodas and stuffs likr that..if you are finding something cheap then it is a very good option..otherwise the Raj Biryani is not a clever choice..only allows 3-4 persons to sit and eat..

It's one of those local roadside joints which make biriyani once early in the morning and serves the same throughout the day. The biriyani is not bad when you compare it to other local eateries of the same category. The prices are low and the food is okay. Definitely worth eating in if you're a little low on cash. And there're only place for three to four people to sit and eat.
