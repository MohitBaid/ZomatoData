The food quality is barely edible. The Biryani I ordered had boiled chicken which tasted almost raw and it had way too much  attar (scent used in Biryani).

A pretty average restaurant for everyday purpose .Nothing flamboyant or flashy.
The decor is normal....
The food is ok, needs further improvement but all in all a good place for having good food on a regular basis .

I ordered food from here, few of the very common and basic dishes like dry chilly chicken, chicken fried rice and Garlic chicken. 
The quality of the food was very unsatisfactory. It was really not up to the mark. The Garlic chicken was so sweet and the colour was so pale that I only managed to have only one piece. My whole dinner was wasted.
If a new restaurant does not focus on the quality of the food then I don't see them anywhere in this competitive market.
And how did you get the Rating of 3.8??? Just not worth it.

A nice budget friendly restaurant near my home.
They have a fast delivery service with cool discounts on ordering above 1000 bucks in total bill value.

My family ordered through home delivery from there the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala Paneer butter masala along with Roti's....

Coming on to the food well it was good hands down and also light to eat which will soothe you specially after you have a long hard day the food will definitely no shortage in recharging your stomach batteries...

So from me it's a 4 star restaurant with quality and lips smacking food at pocket friendly prices....

Definitely will visit in the near future

Bagchi’s Restaurant a newly opened restaurant near New Garia Station serves amazing homely food. The restaurant located in a market place, so its little bit noisy neighborhood, but is a hidden gem. The ambiance and decoration was decent and staffs were very friendly. Warm welcome always makes everyone happy and you will surely get it here. Recently we went to this place to launch there Special Durga Puja 2k17 menu. Every preparation has a unique name and amazingly delicious.

They welcomed with a refreshing drink which was made with yogurt. The preparation we tried are,

Fish Kurkure: It is the Signature dish of this restaurant. Small pieces of fish marinated and coated with a batter and fried until the outer layer become crispy, and tossed with a special sauce which make the taste perfect. Served with chopped bell pepper. A perfect starter. I am sure everyone will like this small crispy fish kurkure.

Mutton Bhunto: Medium pieces of boneless mutton marinated with different spices and cooked perfectly with different sauces until the mixture become dry. The mutton pieces were very soft and tender. Little bit spicy and taste simply superb. A must try.

Jhankar Polao: Unique name. This was mixed a fried rice with lots of dry fruits, small pieces of fried chicken, fish and fried egg. Cherry is also used. This flavoured rice is very good in taste. Try it with any gravy preparation. 

Chicken in Basket: A spicy gravy preparation. Minced chicken wrapped in an envelope and cooked in a spicy gravy. Just try it. It has a very unique taste.

Chicken Muithya: I am related with Chital Macher Muithya which is a famous fish preparation, but chicken muithya is something new for me. It’s a dumpling stuffed with minced chicken and cooked in a spicy gravy. Served with chopped onions and carrot. Taste good. 

Deshi Fish Masala: Delicious mouthwatering fish preparation. Fish cooked in a spicy rich thick gravy. Fish are so soft that it will melt in your mouth in no time. Taste unbelievably good. Served with fresh cream and poached egg from top. Just try it, you can thank me later.

After trying these superbly delicious starter and main courses, we tried dessert, which was

Rice Mifanto: Its taste just like firni but has a different flavour. You will also get three different flavour mifanto here. Chocolate, Strawberry and Mango. This mifanto is real bliss for your taste buds. It looks great and taste even better. 

A experience to be remembered. Try this place in Puja. A homely atmosphere, amazing hospitality and delicious food. The quality and quantity both are very good. Prices are very pocket friendly. So, for pet puja must come a Bagchis’s Restaurant. Wish you all a very Happy Durga Puja. Stay safe have fun. Happy Eating Everyone. After all Good Food Feel Good.

They do say- “KHADDOROSHIK BANGALI“- well you can’t blame them; as a community we are known for our delicious recipes as much as for Rabindranath Tagore. There has never been any culture where food gets so much of preference. We have learnt to incorporate diverse cuisines into our menu while retaining the secret bong ingredients. The result is tasty,sumptuous and very light food which is way tastier than the original ones made with authentic ingredients. Chinese is perhaps the most popular and appreciated cuisine which has blended with our culture really well. Bagchi’s is one such gem of a place located near Garia station where the  touch of bangaliyana in the items will surely impress you apart from the mind boggling taste. Team Panchphron was invited over to taste the Special items incorporated in their menu. Here’s why this should be checked off the wishlist immediately:-

An AC family restaurant , which mainly serves North Indian & Chinese dishes, the owner's surname being Bagchi , is the name of the restaurant  and they believe in serving high quality tasty food at a reasonable price. They also have home delivery system with a prompt service.

Location - This place is located close to Garia railway station at Kishan Mazdoor Bazaar. It is probably the best restraunt of this place. It also connects Garia metro station . So henceforth , it is very conveniently located.

4)Chicken Hariali Kabab 

5) Chicken Malai Kabab

7) Bagchi’s Special Fried Rice

Review - All the items given were well cooked as it should be  and tasted yummy. 

Foodie's top picks - 

1) Gondhoraj Dabmalai - A refreshing and healthy non- alcoholic drink with tender green coconut , kafir lemon etc. It was presented in a shot glass. It instantly energised me after having it. A must try....!!

2)Fish Kurkure- A signature dish of this place. It is made with boneless Bhetki Fish, spices, herbs, flour, egg etc and then deep fried. It was crispy outside and soft inside and was lipsmacking.

3)Chicken Hariyali Kebab- A green kebab which was very flavourful , soft and delicious.

4)Chicken Malai Kebab - Another delectable kebab, it was creamy , supersoft and very tasty.

5) Shanghai Chicken - a saucy , rich and sticky chicken preparation was very flavourful, perfectly cooked  and yummy. 

6) Special Fried Rice - It was usually a mixed fried rice which had a generous fillings, less oily , flavourful and perfectly cooked. It was beautifully presented in the shape of a heart.

So whenever you are nearby this area , come here to enjoy the delicious food ride in a very reasonable price. If you live far , don't worry !! Order your meals and enjoy. They have a very good delivery  service.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception and hospitality.

So whenever you are nearby this area , come here to enjoy the delicious food ride in a very reasonable price. If you live far , don't worry !! Order your meals and enjoy. They have a very good delivery  service.
Thanks to the management for their warm reception and hospitality.

Bagchi's is an AC family restaurant located at Kishan Majdoor Bazaar, Garia, near Garia railway station . It mainly serves North Indian & Chinese dishes. They also provide home delivery system , various combos at a reasonable price.
This restaurant provides MSG free , Dalda free healthy and tasty food at very reasonable price.

Ambience - A Spick & span moderately spaced restaurant with nice interior and comfortable seating arrangements. I went to their kitchen and found it to be very clean.

Staffs and service - The staffs were courteous and service was prompt.

We Panchphoron team were invited for a food tasting session and we had the following -

1) Gondhoraj Dub Malai – It was beautifully presented and was very refreshing and healthy. The blend of tender green coconut and the flavour of Gondhoraj ( kafir lemon ) was fascinating. A must try....!!

2) Crispy Veg with coriander Sauce – Mixed vegetables fried to a crisp and tossed in a delicious Indo-Chinese sweet chilli sauce. It was tangy and lipsmacking.

3) Fish kurkure – A wonderful snack with boneless Bhetki cooked with spices, veggies and sauce. It was the best item of this place and was delectable. Highly recommended...!!

4)Chicken Hariali Kabab – Hariyali Chicken Kabab means chicken kebab with Greens Paste. It was well made & delectable.

5) Chicken Malai Kabab – Murgh malai kebabs are mildly flavored with cream and cheese and ginger garlic paste. It was very soft, creamy & delicious.

6) Shanghai Chicken – Shanghai Chicken in the special Indian style preparation of making chicken in Chinese sauces along with Indian herbs and seeds and then served with the garnishing of spring onions. It is a unique non-vegetarian appetizer from the list of Chinese recipes. The Indo Chinese dish is really meant and irresistible when cooked in the combination way. It was well prepared and very tasty.

7) Bagchi’s Special Fried Rice –A mixed fried rice, less oily , well made and flavourful.

Durga Puja 2017 special Menu Launch - ( 9th sept 2017 )

Coming to the food , we were served on account of a food tasting event on behalf of team PanchPhoron are as under :

1. Fish Kurkure 

2. Mutton Bhunto 

3. Jhankar Polau 

4. Chicken Tawa Tawanchi 

5. Chicken in the Basket 

6. Deshi Fish Masala 

7. Chicken Muittha

Desert :

1. Rice Mifanto

All the dish would be available on all normal days and also during Durga Puja time. As Garia is very famous for its Durga Puja celebrations, come here with your friends & family and relish the food.

All the Puja special dishes were extremely tasty and light in stomach to my surprise.

Highly recommended dishes -

1) Fish Kurkure
2)Chicken Muittha- Cooked like Chitol Macher Muittha , it was mind-blowing.
3)Chicken Tawa Tawanchi
4) Jhankar Pulao- a light fragrant rice preparation was well filled and well cooked.
5)Mutton Bhunto - a type of momo , but has Tandoori flavour. It's a must try....!! Highly recommended ....!!

# Pocket pinch is reasonable along with sufficient quantity.

This is a very nice place to hang out with friends and family and to have lovely dishes in a homely ambience. So whenever you are around this area , come here and relish.... They also have home delivery system with a prompt service, so order and get your meal .

Thanks to the management for their amazing hospitality.

If you’re looking for a place where you want to have some delicious lunch and dinner,foods you want to eat like Indian and Chainese then you have to visit “Bagchi’s”. At here You are treated like family and the service is impeccable. The different meals all have their own unique qualities and character,  which is often missed. The somewhat unprepossessing entrance and the busy take away activity do not substantially detract from the dining experience.
                                                                ...

Not even worth rating. Had ordered dinner from here for 4 people. They delivered normal chicken noodles with tomato ketchup instead of Chicken pan fried noodles. They served Hunan chicken with 'white' gravy. I've no clue why they are serving chinese if they don't have basic food grammar. Then we opened the foil that had 'butter naan'. We couldn't eat even half of the food that we ordered.

I visited Bagchi's several times with my family. It is situated at the heart of ever busy Garia station area, ideally connected by rail and road route. The internal decoration is really unique and very different from so called 'big' restaurants. The uniform of the serving guys, design of furnitures, cutleries and crockeries shows aesthetic sense and created a soothing ambience altogether. Coming to the food quality, Bagchi's can surely compete with the best in business. Chicken reshmi kabab, chicken sweet corn soup, chicken sezwan and Bagchi's special fried rice are some of the delicious dishes , which I liked the most. The dishes are served in due time without unnecessary delay. Finally the hospitality shown by the staffs, is truely admirable. The restaurant essentially cater to the needs of a true foodie , and has the potential to grow in leaps and bounds in near future. Overall, it's a complete family restaurant, and deserves to be visited with all the family members.

I have ordered food at bagchi for the first time...Had a terrible experience....I ordered the biryani, Kashmiri polao at 9 for the first time... But felt to order a hariyali kabab 10 mins later...
Also asked the restraunt to deliver it together.... From that time my wait for the order began. It was supposed to be delivered at 10... But finally got delivered at near about midnight .. the restraunt didn't received our call..Thanx to zomato team ...They constantly kept a track....

Coming to the food...It was cold...Biryani was OK but the chicken was hard .... Polao was not good ...Kabab was OK..
I don't know whether I would be ordering from them again or not.

Best thing I liked about them is the order follow up. They ensured on time delivery and later on inquired about the quality of food which is something I liked. Highly recommended for casual dinner.

Behaviour of staff is good.A welcome drink was given.
Coming to food,ordered one crispy fried chicken,one mutton kasa,one masala kulcha,one veg fried rice and one chilli chicken.
Food was eatable.but according to price,quality was just not okay.Really overpriced.
Chilli chicken and crispy chicken had too much soya sauce and the chicken pieces were stiff.Kulcha was sour,so it was changed and lacha paratha was given in place.
Veg fried was nice.But momo,80rs for one plate.
In short,not satisfied.

I visited there almost three times. Location wise it's easy to find. It's just near the Garia Station-Gangajowara Auto Stand. Ambiance is also good and it's nicely decorated. The staffs are very good and polite with a very prompt service. Each time they welcomed me with a welcome drink which I liked very much. Now coming to the food I have only tasted there Drums of Heaven and Mixed Fried Rice. Both the dishes are very good both quantity and quality wise. But the last time I found the Drums of Heaven a bit more oily than the previous time and for parcel when you people are charging 10/- for container then you should give plastic container boxes not aluminium foils. Only that's why I am giving it a 4 star. Other than that in Garia Station Area it's the best family restaurant still now.

Located amidst garia station baajar area,opposite the fish market.
Tried their Parcel counter. Two Veg chowmein, one chilly chicken and one chicken roll.
The roll was good.
Chilly chicken had 8pcs and it was unnecessarily overpriced.180 bucks? Quality wise,price must be low.And Chowmein was from overnight stock as it got stinky and smelled stale.Had to through the entire food in dustbin.
Me and my family will never visit this restaurant again and will also ask my friends not to go here.

It's a place to go to if you are a foodie and want to have a good meal at an affordable price. You have an array of delectable dishes to choose from, a decor that's not too fancy yet modern and service that doesn't leave you hungry. And the best thing about this new start-up is that it's just the right thing to happen to a locality like Garia. If you're anywhere around, give it a try.

Well... To be very frank when for the first time I visited this restaurant with my girlfriend I thought I may be have to wash the dish for lack of money...cause it has a mind-blowing decoration n the employees are very familiar.. N after the bill I got some relief cause it was in my range... I tried chello kabab.. Which was very nice...😊

Good food, great atmosphere, that's how I would review this place in an one liner. 
Went there for dinner last week with my friends and loved the food.
The Fish Kurkure is a must try.
All in all, it is a nice place to have lunch and dinner and also it is pocket friendly and quality conscious.

Dining experience in Bagchi's was awesome . I found the cuisines as tasty and good for kids. The staff were very gentle and cordial. It is definitely a good destination for hungry tummies.

The location of the restaurant is perfect for parties and get-togethers. The ambience is awesome and the taste of the food is fantabulous.The restaurant attenders or waiters, as you may say, are very humble and well natured. Overall, I would say ....200% yes..for foodie families and bachelors.

One of my favorite place to eat. The spices, the flavor, the taste of mix noodles is unique.  They also have good prawn and shrimp items too. Must try.

We have been there with Family on 27th of January . We have ordered Fish Kurkure as a Chinese Starter . Surprisingly we have been offered with a Welcome Drink and some potato chips . The welcome drink was awesome . After few minutes we have been served Fish Kurkure and the taste was AWESOME . As a main course we have taken Chelo Kabab and trust me we enjoyed the taste like anything . 

Service and taste are good and worth of what you are spending . Highly recommend
