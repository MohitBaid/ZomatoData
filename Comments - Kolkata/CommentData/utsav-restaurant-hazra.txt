We went here in Nabami.... After almost 2 hours later we can enter in d restaurant... Because there were every single place were full!!we decided to wait there.. they said in case we ordered Chinese something....it would be late.... So we ordered chicken clear soup, mutton  biriyani, chicken chap, and brownie with chocolate fudge....
About d ambience...it's a small place ...but nice...
About food ....when our food was served...there was a problem... our mutton biriyani smelled a little bad...so we told them...and there manager came and apologized... And changed our food... After that it was ok...other food was nice... 
Service was good...

Its into a by lane off Hazra crossing. Not difficult to find it out. The place is small have around a sheeting capacity of about 40-45 including both the floors. The place is beautifully decorated and is a lovely place to dine out. The staffs were very well behaved though we had to wait for around an hour after we ordered before we  got the food. Coming to the food, we had ordered mutton steak which was beautifully presented, in fact it was the best decorated dish that I have ever seen, but the mutton was mashed and did not consist of a solid mutton piece. The Mexican chicken was also so so. The mixed chicken noodles was good but nothing extraordinary. The chicken pasta was also good but the quantity was poor. The thing that put us to the edge was the chicken sizzler, it was the best. On the whole I felt it to be a restaurant with price on the higher side but quantity and quality on the lower side. Nothing extraordinary neither visit again type.

A really small, quite infamous restaurant in hazra area. They have upgraded, renovated and made their menu quite interesting. Service is also nice. Had mixed gravy noodles and crispy chicken at this place today, which made me a fan of them again. Quantity, flavour and the colours on the dishes made a smooth palette of pure pleasure on my tongue.
Prices have increased though from before, but its totally worth my meal!

Been there with my close friends during puja time .. This was not my first time as a visitor .. But one thing I need to say quality gets down heavily with proportion to time .. At same place we have had a good food for past 2 years, but this time ( Nabami night ) visiting to Utsav much worthless as their special chicken biriyani and pathetic complementary salad ..  Sorry !! ..

The first time I got to know about this place was also during the Pujas... I think it was 2013. The next time was last year, again during the Puja. And again this year, same Puja time. So this place has become my Puja destination to have the perfect food during this time. But nothing has changed since the first year. Great food quality, great taste and above all awesome hospitality. These things make this place a perfect place to dine out. Thanks for the experience. Will visit again soon and this time before the Puja üòâ

I am visiting this small food joint since my childhood! The decor, the interiors have all remained the same. Most of all, what I liked about this restaurant is their value of food for money! I personally like this joint! U may feel that m biased..yes to some extent I indeed am! the food they serve in here is actually above average and considering the price tag they put up there, its cheap! The quantity of food is satisfactory and one thing nobody can deny is the quality of service! Everyone is generous and helping as they should be! The only con in here is that they take years to serve a plate.. you'll feel drowsy sitting in here for so long. except dat its a visitable joint for foodies like me! :P¬†
P.S. Try the chinese delicacies here. They really serve it good!

I rarely give 5 stars to a small restaurant but this small one really packs a punch!!! This restaurant may look small but the taste of food can easily give some competition to five star hotels as well. Yes guys I m right. 
Located at hazra...limited parking ...ambience satisfactory. But if I come to food its just awesome. All the starters they have in their menu are marvellous. Crispy chicken, crispy fried babycorn,  chicken lollipop, chicken65 are must try. They will blow u away and u will tell where I have been so many days? Coming to main course Chinese dishes are more better. Specially seczwan rice and hongkong chicken. If u want Indian menu u must try veg kofta. Over to dessert section tell the manager Mr. Bijoy to make their special strawberry shake. Its my fav. 
Overall its a small good place to try out quality tasty food in budget price. A must visit for Young's. But if u visit with family of 6-8 u may find the place bit crampy. Best go in group of 3-4. Yes its never empty and u must be prepared to have good number of people at the restaurant all the time. Its quite popular in the locality. 
The taste of food they offer and large variety of dishes is sufficient enough to get a 5 star rating in my opinion. 
Friends pls visit and u will not regret. 
Happy fooding!!!

The quality of food has definitely gone down. However this small restaurant near Hazra crossing is still a restaurant worth a visit. It has nice ambience and decor, but the service time is deplorable. My order of pan fried momos(good by the way) took 45 minutes to reach me just as I was on the verge of walking out!

Utsav is located in Hazra, in very close quarters of Women's Christian College. Its a small restaurant and yesterday when we went in, it was empty. Somehow, I had a feeling that people do not visit very often. But the staff were at their best to make us feel comfortable which I definitely appreciate :)
We were the only customers there.
The ambience is very simple and just basic. Clean.

First things first, we were starving so without going into further discussion, we set the order. Here's what followed :
Crispy pepper chicken (read : starter)
Chicken sweet n sour
Mixed stirred rice (funny name) :p

The food was at par with the prices flowing.  Decent food with generous amount and good to taste.
I mean, when people are hungry, they tend to like any food you give them, so that was my case yesterday.  Not that, I did not like it, but it was not something great either.

A good try for a change.
Wont dissapoint you.

Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

Location: Hazra road, in a lane opposite to the Bhojohori Manna outlet .
Ambiance: Quite cosy and comfortable spread across 2 floors.Seating area is spacious.Though the upper tier section was closed during my afternoon visit on a weekday.Staff were courteous and did a decent job in suggesting the right dishes to order.
Food: Nothing special to write home about.They serve an array of Indian and Chinese dishes.I tried out the Indian dishes -chicken handi,chicken butter masala,mixed veg and phulka rotis. The availability of phulkas was a pleasant surprise-not many joints serve them.The curry items were decent enough.Not very oily and spicy and just right for my palette.
On the flip side the quantity of the dishes was not adequate enough for two people.Service is on the slower side. Pricing is reasonable. Not a bad bet at all if one wants to have a hearty mean around Hazra road area.
Bon Appetit!!!
