I have been to this cafe twice once during the Durga pujas and next time a few days after Diwali.

The Food:- On my first visit we wanted to try their sausage platter, shakes and some finger foods. The usual menu items of small cafes. But to our utter disappointment, they said they had changed the menu for the pujas. We ordered some Chinese dishes and a wrap. Both were equally horrible.Very bad 1st experience.
The next time we went there, it was after the pujas so they had swapped out the Chinese menu. We tried their crispy chili baby corn which was more like crispy sweet baby corn. Then we tried their sausage platter. Well cooked, good presentation but god they used so much chat masala. They have a tendency to put chat masala everywhere and anywhere.Sandwich and cappuccino were the only two remotely edible items we had ordered.
Overall a bad experience
Never going back. 
Maybe will go for the coffee, it was really good.

I have found this small yet cute cafe in zomato and decided to visit for lunch today. 
Location and Ambiance : This cafe location is quite difficult to find but it can be found with the help of Google map easily. The space inside the cafe is quite small but nicely arranged. 
Foods : Our today's menu included,
* Chicken N Cheese Omlet
* Chicken Steak Platter
* Grilled Chicken Salad
*  Panna Cotta ( Nolen Gur Flavour )
The food took more than 20 to 25 minutes to be served before us. Firstly Chicken N Cheese Omlet was served and it tasted quite good with adequate amount of Chicken and Cheese. Next Chicken Steak Platter was served and it contained one Chicken breast in BBQ sauce along with sauted vegetables and mashed potato. This dish was truly commendable. Grilled Chicken Salad was nice too. Lastly the dessert was served and it was a custard served with Nolen Gur and dry fruits toppings. All the food items tasted pretty good. 
Service : Though taste wise the foods are very good but the main drawback of this place is very slow service. They had lack of staffs I guess. Prices are very reasonable. No extra tax is added on the final bill. 
Overall our experience is nice. You can definitely give this place a try if you are looking for hanging out with your friends and spending some quality time.

Pocket friendly with an ounce of lethal quality. Best bites offers you both degrees of pedestrian as it is also apparently one of the smallest cafes in town. I don't think this place is for someone who wishes to eat like a lot, but biting snacks and staying absorbed in conversations happens to be the best form of treasury for this cafe.

Best Bites is a diminutive cafe situated in the Golpark area. The place can accommodate 12 people at once. It is very simply decoreted. A good place to grab a quick bite.

I visited this restaurant on the evening of Christmas with two of my friends. The restaurant was empty around the time we entered. Understandably so, as the crowd was centered around the parkstreet region.

We wanted to try out few items which were highly recommended by the previous reviewers. We ordered:

üî¥ Chicken Pasta in red sauce

üî¥ Fish and Chips

üî¥ Chicken steak platter

üîµ Pancakes

üîµ French Fries

And in dessert we ordered:

‚ö™ A strawberry milkshake
‚ö™ Strawberry Panna Cotta
‚ö™ Brownie with ice cream

The Fish and chips were undoubtedly the best items of the night. The fish was fresh, the fries were beautiful and the dip was amazing. I can go back to this cafe for this dish alone any day. I recommend this dish.

The chicken pasta with red sauce was a nice dish as well. I had no issues with it. It was okay.

Chicken steak was disappointing. The mashed potatoes that came with the dish was very tasty but the star of the dish, the chicken was just not up to the mark. The sauce they used for this dish did not really complement the chicken meat plus the steak was over done. It lost it's natural moisture completely and become very dry.

The pancakes were nice. It is something that I enjoy a lot, and I was glad they got the pancakes right. Though I would like to add that a little more syrup should be provided with pancakes.

Coming to dessert, first was the strawberry milkshake which was okay ish. I did not like it, neither did I hate it.It was just okay.

Then was the turn for the night's biggest disaster , the brownie with ice cream. The dish looked very tasty till the time you try to slice the brownie up. This was more like a brick piece instead of a brownie. It was so hard that when we hit it with a spoon, it did in fact made sound. Additionally, The vanilla ice cream served had more ice pieces in it than the actual ice cream.We showed the manager what was wrong with the dish and he immediately asked the servers to change the dish. However a little later we got to know that they were out of brownies so they cancelled that from our bill.

The Panna Cotta was the last dish of the night and it was delicious. After the disaster with the brownie, we needed that kind of a dessert.

The service aspect of the cafe was kind of a mixed bag. The servers were really nice to us and always greeted us with a smile but I saw few weird practices there. When the first dish came out they served that dish alone with one fork and a spoon which left me startled. I mean I have never went into a restaurant where I had to ask for a plate and spoons from the servers as I believe this is an unsaid rule. But when he asked us that how many plates do we need, it just became weird. However he did provide us plates and spoons after asking.

Overall the experience was a mixed bag. Few food items were very nice but at the same time few were just not up to the mark. The service had some minor flaws but otherwise fine. It was a okayish first visit for me overall.

Simply loved it! They have such a good spread of food, ideal for college going peeps and very friendly pocket pinch as well! The food is very very tasty and quite a sumptuous portion is served! Just one disappointment, the place is a little too small..so can't really get your entire gang if you have a big group of friends...

If you ask me to describe this place in two words then they would be - SUPER CUTE! 
Located in Golpark, a really cute petite cafe,perfect for meet ups with your friend or your loved one. The sweet simple interior won my heart. It ain't a very spacious one, can comfortably accommodate around 10 people.  My friend and I were not very hungry, so our order was confined to coffee,masala tea and french fries. The masala tea was on point. French fries are sufficient in quantity served with ketchup. 
So if you want to catch up with one or two friends over a cup of coffee or some light snacks , do give this place a visit.

It's a tiny 12 seater outlet on the bylane next to Ramkrishna Mission. It's a peaceful cozy cafe and a hidden gem in true terms. We ordered a chicken burger combo, a chicken wrap and hot chocolate. The chicken wrap was a winner for me. The portion is huge and the filling is extremely delicious and juicy. The hot chocolate was again, something worth mentioning, given that it was a cold winter evening. The owners are friendly and so it the rest of the staff. To conclude, it's quite pocket friendly. Although the interiors are nothing extravagant, but the food makes up for it. Highly recommended. Do drop by.

Won't go to the details of the location. Already given below the name of the restaurant. Food is all I can think about, so let's dig in. A quaint and small neat place with decent seating arrangements. Ordered chicken sausage meat platter. Very well made and good presentation. Quantity was good compared to the price. Also had one of the finest early grey at a cheaper price compared to other honchos around the golpark area. Scrambled eggs was good too. My only suggestion is that the menu can be expanded a bit. But a good place to tuck in on a wet evening.

A quaint little cafe amidst the hustling street of Golpark ,Best bites is all about delicious food at pocket friendly rates.The owner husband wife duo jointly run this tiny cafe just beside Golpark Ramkrishna Mission.Decorated with pictures and showpieces here and there this dimly light place can seat up to 10-12 people.Coming to the food, we were invited to taste a sample of their new menu which will start from December.

üçÅHot Chocolate--This is my personal favourite from the menu.Just what you want on a winter evening---a steaming cup of dark brown chocolate  topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.Pure sin it isüòç

üçÅPasta Salad--Tossed in mayo dressing ,veggies with boiled pasta makes for a quick snack on the go.Very refreshing

üçÅFish and Chips--Homemade version of fish and chips ---crispy coating on the outside and soft succulent fish on the inside.This comes with a serving of french fries and mayo on the side.

üçÅGrilled chicken platter--Served with butter sauted veggies and toasted bread ,the grilled chicken was nice

üçÅKitkat Shake--Frothy milkshake topped with a swirl of whipped cream and a kitkat bar on the side.Tastes good

üçÅChocolate cupcake--Chocolate flavoured cupcake with cream frosting on top and dusted with coffee powder was the sweet end to our lovely tasting.

Kudos to team Best bites for their effort.

A hidden gem in the truest sense, this is a small yet delightful caf√© serving some finger licking food in absolutely affordable prices. So if you're looking to spend a quiet afternoon with good food in a soothing ambience, Best Bites is the place to be in. Coming to the decor inside, they've done a good job by utilizing the minimal space with maximum inputs of wall hangings, cute show pieces and soft music in the backdrop to top it off. Now, the most important part of course is the food, coming to which I must say, 'quality over quantity' is what they seem to have implemented. I was presented with an opportunity to taste a part of their new menu that's going to be officially available December onwards, and I got pretty impressed with the following >>

‚Ä¢ Hot Chocolate - The perfect hot beverage to sip on, as the chills start to set in. (5/5)

‚Ä¢ Pasta Salad - Surprised with the inclusion of such a dish here, I can't help but say, it was well made with a balanced flavour. (4/5)

‚Ä¢ Fish & Chips - Simply loved this one. Ample amount of french fries and the mayo dip made the deep fried fish truly enjoyable. (4/5)

‚Ä¢ Grilled Chicken Platter - Not one of the most authentic item, but it wasn't a total miss as well. Served with hard toast and stir fried veggies, the platter was nice. (3.5/5)

‚Ä¢ KitKat Shake - Frothy milkshake with crunchy bites of KitKat, another beverage to love here. (4/5)

‚Ä¢ Chocolate Cupcake - Garnished with a swirl of whipped cream, this small Cupcake is the perfect item to finish off your sweet tooth craving with. (3.5/5)

All's well that ends well, so after a sweet ending, we left with a satisfied tummy and happy heart. Do visit Best Bites for a memorable experience and definitely try their upcoming Menu.

Dont judge a book by it's cover! This proverb is applicable  for this place.  Located near the back gate of Golpark Ramkrishna Mission,  this is small cute cafe.The best thing about this cafe is it is extremely  budget friendly.  For two person it costs around 350 bucks!!  And most importantly,  though the food here is cheap,  but the quality of the food is great indeed. 
Now coming to the items i tasted. 
1.Hot chocolate - A thick layered hot chocolate garnished with chocolate syrup was served. It was great in taste. 
2. Kitkat Shake - Decorated with cream and kitkat,  this shake is a must try for all the choclate lovers out there. 
3. The pasta salad - This was my favourite  among the all.  Mixed with veggies white sauce,  pasta and Mayoneise this is a highly recomended dish. 
4. Fish and chips - Fried bhetki fish served with a dip and fry.  Indeed great in taste. 
5. The grilled chicken platter - The grilled chicken served with crunchy toast and veggies. Is a must trt for all the continental  lovers. 
6. The chocolate cup cake-A cute little cupcake garnished with cream , was great in taste,  and coffee powder dusted over the cream gave a different  touch to the cupcake. 
Over all this place serves great food in a very pocket friendly budget. 
All the above menu will be available from 1st december 2017. 
One must visit the place and try out their new launches.

Look I like cheap food but then again I like cheap food which is tasty. Here in best bites the sandwich which I ordered was full of capsicum the sausage platter which I ordered was full of capsicum, I wonder do they grow capsicum in some nearby  farm? if they do I will be very intrested. The shakes were ok, the ambience well what can I say it's a small place just opposite ram krishna mission gate number 4.
To sum it up if you are looking for a tasty meal then give this place a miss but if you are low on money but high on hunger or weed go for it!

Directly opposite to RKM 3rd gate, the shop is small but has air conditioning. We order the chicken sausage platter and coffee. Even though we were the only customers, service was really slow. The chicken sausage platter had a bland taste, though well cooked sausages. The bread served with the platter was completely burnt. The coffee was weak and had added milk, despite specifically asking not to do so. Passable food.

Best Bites is located in Golpark inside a small alley beside the Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture. The cafe is a small one consisting of modest seating. I found the ambience of the place lovely with a nice collection of Bengali songs. Even the staff are very hospitable making for a quite warm, loveable environment. Coming to the food, we ordered White Sauce Chicken Pasta, Chicken Sausage Grilled Sandwich and Chocolate Shake. I loved the pasta dish and it was very well made. The dish had a huge amount of quantity and would suffice a couple of people. The chocolate shake tasted nice as well. The grilled sandwich could have been better made and had too many vegetables in it. The place is quite cheap and it also has a 10% discount on bills above Rs. 199/- for students on brandishing their ID card. Since we visited the place in the Diwali week, the restaurant authorities gifted us a surprise gift in the end. Overall, a good experience!

But the chilli chicken was upto the mark. I liked it. Chicken wrap was not at a wrap. They made it like a roll thing. Overall the experience was okay but didnt like it that much that i would recommend someone to visit this place.

A small and cozy place situated on a Bylane near ram krishna mission gate no. 4.. Google map will be your saviour.. A little place decorated well.. 3 to 4 tables which can accommodate 12 people max..

We ordered blue lagoon as a refresher.. to be honest it was awful.. It was not at all cold neither refreshing.. plz don't try this at all..

Chicken and cheese sandwich :- This dish was quite good.. The serving was also good.. 4 pieces of stuffed bread grilled to perfection..

Chicken burger :- again another good dish.. A patty made of chicken and potatoes and other veggies topped with tomato onion cucumber and on top of that a cheese layer.. A humungous burger.. was good in taste..

Overall a good place to have some evening snacks.. They don't charge any tax.. overall bill was 225..

Do give a visit..happy dining...üòÄ

A boon to the student crowd of the area!. ‚óè Location: Bang opposite to gate no. 4 of Ram-Krishna Mission Cultural Institute. Or, crossing the road, go straight inside the lane opposite to Anjali Jewellers. ‚óè Interiors: with 10-12 seating arrangements, the cafe has a dimly lighted ambience which is so soothing to the eyes after a hefty day.

Just opposite to the gate no. 4 of Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Golpark gets a new address for quick bites. This small cafe with seating capacity of 12-15 is going to make a good name. Newly opened just 20 days back, this place already started creating a buzz among the foodies. Their main USP is, they are ‚Äòeasy on pockets‚Äô and ‚Äòthe standard quality‚Äô.
                                                                ...

As a modern day guy .. Caf√© sounds interesting and attractive too. A little caf√© opened just behind The Ramkrishna Misson Cultural , Golpark. Keeping in mind about the student crowd over there, probably I will say it as an intelligent idea.
                    

First thing I will like to say that they had kept the pricing part in mind while forming the menu. Very much pocket friendly. Really a good option for college students around it.

Let‚Äôs say me about the food part. We had Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich, Veg Burger, Egg Wrap, Chicken Popcorn, Strawberry flavoured French Toast, Chicken Sausage Platter, Masala Thumps Up,  Mixed Sauce Chicken Pasta, Masala Omlette, Coffee and Cold Coffee with ice cream.

Coffee at that rate was very good... Trust me.. I will visit this outlet for Chicken Sausage Platter and ¬†Mixed Sauce Chicken Pasta.

For more details, visit my blog...

" Best Bites " - The name itself describes the place and the food...
This is a newly opened small cafe just at the back side of Ramkrishna Mission ( Golpark ) near it's 4 no. gate . Just 2 mins of walking from the bus stand.
This place is very neat and clean and very simply decorated with seating capacity of around 12 people. As it is a collage nd office area this place has come up with a very very pocket friendly price which can be easily affordable to the crowd.. The staffs and the owner is very friendly.. We tried few of their items which were really good.
* French toast- if you r fond of sweets nd strawberry den go for dis strawberry flavoured French toast.
* Chicken cheese grill sandwich- it was too good, not lyk sandwiches we have at other places but having a desi flavor in it.
* Masala omlet- omlet with veggies nd house made spices.
* Popcorn chicken- not lyk the KFC one but in a desi home made style chatpata , good to have with hot coffee.
* Veg Burger- crispy, crunchy nd cheesey veg burger
* Egg wrap- eeg roll not lyk da regular one , but a wrap in desi style with mix veggies
* Chicken sausage platter - this is their signature dish I wl say chicken sausage tossed with veggies nd served with a grilled bread nd boiled egg+ house made spices for a desi taste...
* Chicken mixed sauce pasta- this is another item I can say which was really tasty nd mouthwatering along with chicken nd cheese nd mixed sauce , sweet corn nd veggies.
Last but not the least comes hot coffee , cold coffee with ice cream and masala cold drinks which r equally good...
Thanks to Mr. Pallab Saha nd Sayantani Mukherjee Saha for inviting us nd their warm hospitality..

A really cool cafe recently opened! Located just near gate no.4 of ramkrishna mission,golpark, and is a 2min walk from the main road!
First of all I would like to categorize this as a super pocket friendly cafe! Apt for the huge students crowd in the area!
We were invited on a food bloggers meet, for the tasting of the new menu, and well we were satisfied :)
All the prices are really affordable and this place gets a 5/5 for value for money. The interiors are neatly decorated, but the place is a bit small, having sitting capacity of 12 people.
Now coming to the food,we had
‚Ä¢ Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwhich-well done!
‚Ä¢ Veg burger- crispy and hunger satisfier.
‚Ä¢ Egg Wrap-up twist to the desi egg roll. Really well made!
‚Ä¢ Chicken Popcorn-not the kfc version, but in their own style, with bread crumbs coating! Good quantity served. Can be tried with coffee or masala cold drink.
‚Ä¢ Masala Omlette-Delight for egg lovers!
‚Ä¢ Strawberry flavoured French Toast - can be tried if you have a sweet tooth. French toasts with egg done with strawberry flavour.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Sausage Platter-Must try! Totally recommended! Chicken sausage with sauted veggies and egg! Loved it!
‚Ä¢ Mixed Sauce Chicken Pasta-the chefs special! Another must try! One of the best pastas i had in recent times, in such prices. Amazing! A total meal in itself!
‚Ä¢ Masala Cold Drink
‚Ä¢ Coffee- well made :)
‚Ä¢ Cold Coffee with ice cream- well done :) try this!
A must visit for friends looking for a hangout in a pocket friendly cafe.
A big thank you to Mr. Pallab Saha for inviting us, and Mrs. Sayantani Mukherjee Saha for hosting us with such warmth. And ofcourse

Heard about this place from a friend and visited last Saturday based on his recommendation. It is a small cafeteria near Ramkrishna mission Golpark. The menu is different and offers various options to choose from, rare to be found under a single roof. We ordered Chicken Cheese Sandwich, Chicken Popcorn,  White Sauce Veg Pasta. We also went for Rose lassi and Cold Coffee. The preparations were really lip smacking and the beverages were heavenly. Now what is jaw dropping is the value for money that this place provides. Our bill amount was only Rs. 400 which included a 10 percent off. The staff were really courteous and took sincere feedback of every dish. If someone is hunting for good food without a major pocket pinch, one should definitely check out BEST BITES.

Location:it's in the just after the Lawrence and Mayo showroom if u are heading towards golpark
Ambience and staff:a small place with not much decor but it's cleanliness gives good vibes.
We were welcomed by one of the staffs and order was taken by a female staff who most probably was the cook too
Food: we were actually not prepared for such quality and quantity of food at such a cheap rate.we hit this place because we were completely broke.ordered
Rose lassi (the curd was perfectly blended and the whipped cream or dahi on top with rose flavor was real good),soda shikanji(this hat perfect sweetness and refreshing one), chocolate shake(the flavors felt so good to the taste buds)
For the meal we had,chkn sausage platter(stir fried veg with diced sausages,good one)chkn salad(shredded chkn and sauteed veg with spices that tasted good enough),chkn Burger (though we were disappointed to see that it contained only the chkn Patty topped with cucumber tomato and lettuce and no cheese slices but at the 1st but it filled in pleasure..the Patty contained cheese and chkn and it was so perfectly crunchy and soft),the chkn white sauce pasta( it was good but would suggest it to be a bit cheesier as white sauce stuffs are meant to be cheesy affairs),mixed sauce chkn pasta (this one was okayish could have been better with a bit spice and sauces) and lastly the chkn cheese sandwich+this was good with crunchy toasts but a bit more cheese would have been better)
All this came for an unbelievable low budget and tax-free..a must drop in for good food and low pinch in pocket

Been there here on 15th August with a friend. Located very near to Golpark, we found this place quite cozy and comfortable to hang out. Ordered Baby Corn Cheese Sandwich, Cheese Omelette and Coffee. Food was really nice and staff was courteous. We found the prices quite low considering the quality of food and the ambience. To top it up, we got a special innaguration discount. Would love to come back here.... Food lovers can try out!

Well, I wouldn't be biased because I am an ardent foodie !
If you are a lover of any good kind, I guess this is the door you'd want to open ! Though the place isnt too big, it is just enough for you to come, sit comfortably with your friends, eat, drink and be merry !

Coming to the food, I would strongly recommend you to try the sandwiches. We have a tendency to go for non-veg ones, but I can vouch for the veg ones too ! Other than the sandwiches, you have pastas (the one in white sauce is yum!), wraps, fries and other things nice !
The smoothies are too good too !

Kolkata is young ! Kolkata loves food !

Visit this place. It's worth it üòä
