Recommended for all foodies to enjoy the most beautiful view of the city with good food in front! Located opposite Nazrul Manch and easy to locate. We had ordered a virgin mojito, virgin Mary and chicken roulade. The mocktails were good and the chicken roulade is highly recommended. It is stuffed with ham and cheese with perfect seasoning and tasted really good! There are beautiful seating arrangements both inside and out on the roof. The staff was very affable. I would definitely visit it again! Happy eating!

When i went to this place on a sat eve at 6, it had waiting for about 20-25 mins, but it was worth it when we got the place to sit rooftop,kolkata looked beautiful from here. Rest food and drinks are good so is music and the crowd.

I along with my cousins went there today at around 1pm for a family get together. The restaurant is located in a very popular place just opposite to Nazrul Manch and very easy to find out. The decor is impressive but we faced confusion about our table. Next, Food was delicious and satisfied our expectation. Quantity is good according to the prize. Deserts were really very impressive except Cheese cake.Staffs are very helpful and courteous.Recommended for college groups and friends' get together mainly.

What an evening spend in an awesome environment . The restaurant is located in a very popular place just opposite to Nazrul Manch. A small place but a perfect pub with a perfect view. The drinks are good and the food was also good. The entrance is small but you will like the lady in reception and you can wait for sometime to get a place in rooftop. We reached around 6 and have to wait for sometime to get a place in rooftop. Overall the experience is really good.

Been there before some hours ago & it was my first visit over there...The interior is awesome & atmosphere is super cool but unfortunately some stuffs & it's service is truly poor.... Me & one of my friend were at the 2nd floor and we had to sit inside due to the crowd... We were keep on asking about the food & hookah but nobody was even bother to assist us well... All Stewart's were very busy going here & there & also doing back bitching about someone i@n front of others.... I requested a song but unfortunately that was also not being played... Anyways it was not a good experience over there as we both imagined it would be... Take care of the place with some good stuffs if possible....

I have been there thrice and always faced disappointment.
They were not able to deliver the food every single time which is definitely a minus point for the cafe.
Hence, not thinking any longer to visit again.

This place has different levels of seating and has an option to sit on terrace as well which has amazing views, and you can have Hookah as well.

At one of the floor you have an option to sit for a fish spa and enjoy your drinks with your feet in water..The food is good and ambience is pretty interesting.

This place is definitely one of my favorites now! Beautiful place. Really good ambience. We had ordered Tandoori chicken, meat lover's pizza and beers. Food was brilliant specially the tandoori chicken. However, the rooftop was already full so we had to sit inside in the indoor section.
Anyway, the view still kills it and the people serving us were really polite too. It's a bit pricey but the food was worth every penny!

This is a overhyped place in Kolkata. They have a long menu but half of the items are not available. 

They will make you wait for an hour to tell you that we dont have enouhh options. Manager is a kind guy (sarcasm) who will give u life lessons (God is great and vl help u wth your choice of seating) but is not competent to give u place to sit. They will make u sit all around before you settle down in some place.

Waiters found here are special characters who belongs to rare species amd are full of arrogance. They are proud to tell that they dont have enough options. They vl give u some sort of deal u take it or leave it. And that too at exorbitant rates.

We visited this place on 1st January. We had to wait for more than 30 min to get a table, may be that was because of the date.
Now coming to the food, We tried Prawn in Honey Hunan Sauce and it was just fabulous. Best ever prawn dish I have ever tasted in Kolkata. You must try this one if you love prawn. The quantity was enough for two people.In soups, cream in roasted chicken soup was also very good.
Cocktail we ordered was stuffed with little bit extra ice cubes. Only reason for not giving a 5 star review. 

When it comes to the ambience, roof top segment is what everyone was asking for. Even though the bar counter attached segment is also well decorated with nice window views.

The staffs were very polite and friendly.

They just killed it with their everything. Very smooth behaviour by the staffs. A bit crowded was there as it is 1st Jan of this year. The musicians also making the moment more cherishable. We had to face a large queue before entering. The management was also good and courteous. Next visit for sure😎

This place was on my wish list for long and finally planned a lunch here with my special. 

The ambience of the place is very nice . The staff is very cooperative and polite . The place has a wonderful decor, completely going by its name having a good, old English bar in the centre of a large space which lots of seating available. The chairs and the sofa, the brick wall decor . The outside place is very beautiful , with nice top view and from the terrace the whole kolkata view really changes the minds.

When we entered the place, it was filled.. so had to wait for a while to crunch in. The staff members were not that receptive and that was a bit disappointing. Despite having vacancies in the rooftop, we were made to sit inside. 
The food was average. I didn't find anything great about this place except the ambience. We were eager to attend the live performance  but had to leave due to time constraints. Rescheduling the live performance at a convenient time would be great

Nice place to chill with an amazing atmosphere! The hookah is one of the best I have had till date! It was a pan flavoured hookah! The food was good and reasonably priced. The desserts raised the rating, the blueberry cheesecake is really nice and filling, don't order the tiramisu if you do not like the bitterness of coffee, and the chocolate mousse is quite regular compared to the others! The cocktails are nice and refreshing too! We tried the daab punch and the LIIT, and we didn't regret our decision! :)

When it comes to this Cafe OMG the ambience- amazing. You get to see the roof top view of the metropolitian along with mind boggling food, drinks and hell lot. Though expensive but worth it. Had ordered fresh lime soda, Pizza and lot more. But it seemed i treated heaven to my eyes, stomach and ear too as there was live music being performed. What else do someone need when we get all the three in one go? A must visit.. Coming to the hospitality- I rarely received such.

What's up- heard a lot about this place. Hence thought to drop in. Now when I entered at around 6ish on a winter evening, I was surprised to see the place filled, so had to wait for a while to crunch in. 

The staff members are not that receptive to the customers, that's the thing I dislked, and was taken aback. I was asked to occupy the table at the bar counter, so we sat there for good 30 minutes and were in a mood to smoke Hookah, so asked the staff if we could have Hookah. The staff suggested us to share a table, with a couple in the outdoor seating. Which seemed unreasonable since we are paying such huge bucks, and in return we need to share tables like roadside joints. This is the reason for the 3 rating. 

The food seemed average, ambience is amazing, lights are great. The music played in the house is mundane.

Went there with my friends during Durga Puja. Had to wait for a long time to get in. The ambience is pretty cool..roof top but apart from that service isnt that great! Ordered (4+1) budweiser beer, jagerbomb, kamikaze shots, chilly baby corn, chicken 65 & a few other starters. The food wasn't that great compared to the price. Extremely overpriced & adding to that the seats which we were offered was just in front of the huge sound systems which was deafening.

There is an upper portion roof top area where we partied.  Ordered Pan fried chilly fish, grill chicken with mustered and mayonnaise, pan fried Cantonese style noodles and chicken hakka noodles. In drinks we ordered a virgin mojito,  9 small bacardi white rum(2:1 offer was on) 3 spritrs and a bottle of mineral warer. Bill Rs 2970. Food was awesome.  staffs were courteous.  Blown away to witness the ambience.  Must visit again.  only suggestion is to allow prior booking of table.  Thank u what's up

I absolutely adore this place. This is the best place to come with a few friends to catch up over a beer and some scrumptious pizza. The rooftop over looks Southern Avenue and give a 360• view of the lake. The ambiance over some delicious kebabs seals the deal for me. I recommend to go here in winter afternoon to soak in the sun and relax with with their various options of coach tails and fries.

Hopped in to this awesome place, after a random unplanned visit to Rabindra Sarovar. We were lucky to find the Christmas Special menu still available! So, turkey it was...
This is a rooftop restaurant located on the 6th floor. Both open-air and in-door seating arrangements are available. Interiors are funky and differently designed, lights hanging from water pipes, seats on top of bicycle pedals, etc.
Food is awesome! We tried:
◽Turkey ham rolled on Chicken sausage (6 pieces - Quite heavy a starter for 2 people)
◽Roasted turkey with cranberry sauce (shredded turkey, with grilled veg, mashed potato - sufficient for 2, after the heavy starter).
Ambiance is western, waiters are courteous. Pocket pinch is moderate to low. Only the serving time could be faster, as we had to wait for almost an hour. This is certainly a hidden gem!

30th October: my first visit to this place, I had no idea that my city would look this good from top. Such serenity, amazing atmosphere, beautiful decor,soothing music playing in the background. We had pan flavored hookah, virgin mojito,chicken65, chicken tikka kabab,formaggio chicken, Cantonese fried noodles. Food was really good both in quality and quantity. Chicken65 and formaggio chicken are highly recommended. Noodles dissapointed me a bit.

21st December: my 2nd visit to this place was a complete lit. Enjoyed a tale of cocktails. Had lots of amazing cocktails along with lip smacking good crispy chili baby corn.

I heard a lot about this cafe and went there.Honestly this restaurant is not for having dinner. If you want to get an open rooftop bar to drink and smoke and along with it you want to have some snacks this place may( or may not) be suitable for you .They made us wait for more than 40 minutes and provided with absolute shitty food. The quantity was too small and the quality was in a word ghastly.we ordered roasted turkey(it was a "turkey festival" they said) and I felt like puking it out after having a few bites.It was totally undercooked.I won't recommend it to anyone. if you want to have continental food, it's better to go to Park Street. There are lots of good quality restaurants there.

Absolute recommend for casual dining. What's up is famous for its open terrace ambiance. The management is also very helpful. On weekends, one may find the place tight on schedule and have to wait for sometime to gain entry. The house is divided in three phase. The main entrance room is cozy and nice for couples to sit and enjoy the evening with dim lights. The second phase is the bar as one may sit infront of the bartender admiring the wide variety of malts sitting over bar stools. The third one is the open terrace with two levels. Awesome for group hangouts as well as enjoying the evening under naked sky. We had hot crispy chilli chicken and hawaiian pizza. The service quality was equally nice.

I love to come to this place. But the rating is based on the service entirely. What’s the point of having ladies night when you cannot cater to the requirements . I saw the guys serving only those tables that ordered drinks eligible for payment and not complimentary. This is not how business is done, this way you will make money for sure but cannot reach heights. Extremely disappointed with the service and will never ever bring my friends back here.

I went to What's Up, Southern Avenue on Christmas eve 2017, expected a lot of crowd so went there early by 4 PM. What's Up is an amazing place to hang out with your friends with an awesome view - watched the sunset from roof top. The staff was very very friendly and accommodating. As we requested, we were provided with the Jacuzzi table/warm pool table - it was so relaxing to have wonderful food and cocktail with your feet in warm pool , wonderful music in the air ! 
We ordered Grilled fish and Grilled chicken platter - both were awesome. The staff (I guess Arnab) was very attentive and listened to the food and drink preferences carefully and suggested accordingly... I couldn't imagine a better ambience, food and drink in so much rush in Kolkata !!! We had 2-3 yr old children with us and they enjoyed the music and jacuzzi too (unexpectedly)...Overall A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!!!

No drinking water glasses provided along with no spoon but only fork till almost towards the end of our eating and drinking. Our group of 5 ordered drinks and non veg platter and chicken soup fried rice and Chilli paneer. The food quality on the platter was astonishingly low quality which when pointed out they just blabbered and stuttered and kept saying sorry without acting on it. Total confusion. Guess they depend on guests getting drunk to not remember the taste but the ambience which was the only high point.

Great ambience! It's an awesome place to hangout with a bunch of friends. But not that great for couples. Food is okay. We didn't find the food to be something mind-blowing. But of course, they serve quality food there. Staff is courteous and helpful.

What an amazing place to hang out and chill with friends! Such perfect vibe! Good food , great music, lovely view. As I watched the winter sun set behind one of the city's high rises, I felt glad to have finally come to this cafe after a long period of  procrastination.

Extremely dissatisfied with the food and the quality of  service was also pathetic, infact we weren't even served any water and had to ask for it twice while we were half way through our meal.

I attended the Turkey Festival here on 24th Dec 2017. The food was excellent and served well.. Though the environment is a bit crowdy but the scenic view is good from the roof. A great service indeed.

An advice to management: Must focus on sitting arrangements, as I had to wait for half n hour with my family to get an appropriate seat.

Amazing place to rewind and rejuvenate. The open area seating is really awesome. One doesn't have to worry about smoking zone bcoz most of the area is open. The only problem is the waiting time for the elevator, small washroom and I did not like the cocktails as well. I ordered a mojito and found that the mint was black in colour.. on asking the server he called the bartender. To my surprise the bartender told me that the dark color is due to brown sugar used in mojito.. I know that mojito has demererara but never understood how the brown sugar can turn a mint leaf to black colour. Anyways I would suggest everyone to go for either fermented beverages or spirits but not order cocktail.

Located in Southern Avenue, around half a mile from Golpark, this place is one of the coolest place to hang around with your friends. 
The food is presented very nicely and even the Cocktails are quite good.
You must try the meat lovers pizza 🍕 and the noodle wrapped chicken and definitely get the Beer Bucket.

The best part is the Alfresco Seating along with mini pool. If you have not visited yet then you must!

I think What's Up is the best place i've visited this year. The quality and quantity of food is top notch. 
However, their aim to serve every customer the best is what I loved about this place. As you ll open the menu card , the very first page will bring a smile. 
Where they have mentioned : "We don't accept tips or service charge. To show appreciation , just visit again". The staffs are very cordial and prompt. The view is spectacular. I returned home with an elated and satisfied experience of this restaurant. A must visit. :)

We were fortunate enough to visit on a Tuesday. What is pretty amazing about the place is the ambience, especially the outdoor seating area with little water areas under the tables. The cocktails served were okay, nothing over the top or different. We were having a problem with our orders placed but the manager really helped us through. It wasn't too crowded and we made some friends over the evening too. Great place to chill and hang out with friends while sipping on cocktails under the clear sky. We had an amazing time there, surely to pay a visit soon enough.

This is one for the 'Must visit' list for all tourists and Kolkatans.
Perched on the 7th floor of an otherwise ugly building, with a view to die for, this place is a mini paradise for couples.
Their USP - the "Jacuzzi seats"!
On what was a first in a lifetime experience, I didn't hesitate for a second to pull up my jeans and soak my legs in the lukewarm water, with a bottle of chilled beer!
The Tender Coconut cocktail is another item you should try!
In short, a "Fatafati" place!

Heard a lot about this place. Finally I was there with my friends. Lot of space and enough tables to handle rush. Rooftop tables are main attraction of this place..but since it was raining yesterday we chose to sit inside. The view was amazing from the top. For starters we ordered Cajun Chicken and Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. Both the dishes were very delicious..mainly the baby corn( ordered a second one). For entrees we ordered Chicken Lasagne and Fish and Chips. The portion of the lasagne was not satisfying and neither the taste. But the fish was fresh, delicious and two decent sizes of fish was served along with crispy french fries with tartar sauce. Dessert was Baked Alaska and Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream (my favourite). Baked Alaska was disappointing, but Brownie was good. The service should have been much faster. But overall a good experience. Perfect place to hangout. Wish to visit again.

I feel like this place is overrated. Yes it's very chic and we'll decorated to attract the youngsters to chill, take cool photos at the rooftop overlooking the city or grab a beer or smoke in the smoking zone. Food is good too and so is the quantity. It is a bit priced. But I don't understand what the hype is for. I don't know because I haven't been here at night. Overall it's a nice place to be, but a one time thing for me.

Easy to spot in light traffic this café is right opposite Rabindra Sarobar Najrul Mancha gate. 
Of course when you go to a café that has an open rooftop, during winter, you want to sit there. But when we got there we faced a slight impedance as only the "jacuzzi" seat was empty so we had to sit indoors. But thankfully the service staff were very helpful in this matter and they relocated us as soon as there was an opening.
Coming to the food. We ordered Tandoori chicken, chicken roulade, meat lover's pizza, two-in-one Panna cotta, sizzling brownie, caprioska, sex on the beach and planter's punch.
The tandoori chicken and meat lover's pizza were a delight. The chicken roulade failed to impress. The Panna cotta was interesting but could do with some improvements and the sizzling brownie was of course scrumptious. 
Though the service was slow it gave us more time to chat on the open rooftop on a cloudy winter afternoon so no complaints there. However the ambience was completely ruined by the loud and obnoxious music. Perhaps something slower or even the absence of music would be better suited.

It's a perfect setting for a relaxing rooftop dining experience amidst the bustling city.
They could hugely improve it by refraining from playing loud music all the time :)

The decorations are very beautiful and quirky. Courteous staff. Coming to the food, it wasn't exceptionally good but worth the money.

We ordered sex on the beach and caprioska from the vodka based cocktails and planter's peach from the rum based ones. They were good.

For starters, we had chicken roulade and tandoori kebabs. Very beautifully presented and tasted good too.

For main course, we had meat lovers pizza. And it was really good!

And finally for the desserts, we took the two-in-one Panna cotta and sizzling brownie. The brownie tasted usual but the Panna cotta had a really interesting taste to it.

First, I mention the location. It is a prime location on the heart of southern avenue. There are a few restaurants around it. It will catch your attention by the name written on a guitar.
 I went there once and ordered for Momo with tandoori chilli chicken stuffing and meat lover's pizza. The Momo tasted unique (if you don't like much spicy food, don't go for it) and the pizza was heavenly. You will regain your love for pizza if it seems to be lessened. 
Next I mention the ambience. Mostly young gangs are found here. There's a rooftop provision which is very attractive to many folks. 
Prices are slightly high but it won't be an issue if you are in a group. You will feel slight pain in your pocket if it is a couple's date.
Thank you!

Nice place, good ambience, good food and decently priced.
We went there for lunch on a bright winter day. Enjoyed our meal while sitting under the sun, as the place also has open rooftop seating. 
We were two people and ordered tomato soup, gnocchi de patate, triple schezwan fried rice and chilli paneer and virgin mojito.
Everything was good and tasty except for the mojito which was overpowered by lemon and had little flavour of mint.
The place has closed as well as open seating. Overall it was a nice experience and I would definitely recommend the place.

The best amongst so many rooftop cafés. The staff are so friendly and co-operative…seriously needs to get a thumbs up for the excellent service they provide. The live DJ was an add-on boon to the night as I went to celebrate my would-bes’ bday which was made more special by the whatsup staffs. Played bday song along with the cake which I handed them to bring it on later, and wallah they did as I asked for, without any charges….!!!!!!. Really made the night worth to celebrate for. 

Thanks a ton to the team….Good job guys… Behaviour is really important for any customer to give honest reviews. Will definitely come back to enjoy the Jacuzzi table….

They also have a air conditioned bar area and separate smoking zone area. The outdoor seating is specially nice in the evenings. There is live band performing everyday around 8 pm. The selection of English, Hindi n Bengali songs is superb. The band is awesome. Their food is also very yummy !!! Both veg n non veg options are superb. They have a good variety of mocktails as well.

Eating is one of the great beauties in life.
One of my favourite recreations.
But what's more than just eating is eating with the people you love, gossip ,drinks and calcutta from the top view - a perfect match to a good ambience to set the good vibes meter to a high.

Beer. 🍺
Favourite people.
&
Calcutta from the rooftop during sunset or maybe during night 🌃

The cafe is divided into 3 sections,the section on the later half being the open part,with an attached hookah parlour(lit by blue colour and the light carried by smoke) and just above this parlour is the highest point of this cafe,the perfect altitude which gives you a "balcony" seating experience when you're watching the live performance and also gives you a fantastic view of the city of joy.

Music?Live music!
It's the best part of this cafe.
The day i visited this place,it was a 3-piece band(vocals,synth & guitars) performing variety of songs ranging from let it be by The Beatles to Shape of you by ed sheeran.
From the music playing to the voice style of the woman who was singing was mesmerising and surely added to the soothing experience of the cocktail.

The open terrace has the tables where you can sit by dipping your feet into water,sounds kinda spa?
The covered section of the place is compact yet well presented as the decors are well generated to comply with the mood and "yellow" light's can never go wrong as for the warmth of colour it gives to the place is fascinating.

The food they serve are good enough, especially the item's which include "cheese" in them are the perfect companion for your drink diaries.
The rice & noodles,quality of which is a bit under par as compared to the price which's charged for the same
Classic cheese fondue with garlic bread, bruschetta & mutton items are the best of the lot along with the continental delicacies.

It's the perfect place for a cosy and a casual dining experience and the nicest part being the cooperation you get from the staffs.

5-star to their amazing hospitality.

Much has been said about this place and today I m going to add more adjectives to this must visit place. We have visited the place on 25th of November wid my constant. We had a birthday to celebrate on that day. So I told them to arrange one surprise cake. Each and everyone of this place is so we'll behaved and attending to you the moment you enter. They nicely arranged one brownie for the surprise birthday celebration. We have celebrated kind of surprise party before but their arrangement was really appreciated.
Now coming to the food menu, we have ordered Bruschetta with chicken Ham, Roasted chicken Nachos,Fish Salad(must try) and their signature cocktail Drunken Parrot.
We really amazed by their foods,service and also the view from the place. I highly recommended to visit the place once.Because after visiting the place you will be definitely falling in love with the place.

Amazing place to enjoy a Saturday evening. I've been here twice, and both the times I've been lucky enough to witness live music. Kebabs and the Shepard's pie is a must try. Moderately expensive but worth the money. You can choose to sit inside and enjoy the ambience, although sometimes it becomes a bit stuffy.. or go for the rooftop. (This is where the live music happens).  They have this arrangement on two tables at the rooftop ( which I have never seen vacant) where the table is surrounded by a periphery of water and you can dip your feet in it while you sit.

No need to look at any reviews. Just jump in. The atmosphere wil drove you all. This rooftop restaurant cum bar is one of the best till date. You get various options for sitting. One inside near the bar counter which is greatly decorated, many in open air which is the best part. The cold breeze, the sun setting scene will catch your views. The food is also really good there. ❤️❤️

This place is just perfect to hangout with with friends or cousins. Be it in daylight or or after sunset, the view from this place is just awesome. Even the ambience is great. The cafe has three different pars, like one is indoor, second one is outdoor, that is rooftop which also has a jacuzzi and third one is tge smoking zone which is mainly for hookah. Coming to their dishes, all of them are quite good. We ordered Bruschetta with creamy chicken, Mutton Barrah kebab, Molten Chocolate Brownie shake, Baked Alaska and out of all the dishes we ordered we liked 'Baked Alaska' the most. Overall the place is very beautiful.

KUDOS to team what's Up..
Since a long time i had this place on my mind and atlast got the chance to drop in for yesterday's lunch.
Just opposite the Rabindra sarabar lake this place is known for its ambience; outdoor sitting area,Jacuzzi and all. Since it was hot and sunny yesterday we settled down inside. But the manager was sweet ngh to let us explore the whole property b4 we choose our table. The indoor area is small and cozy with quirky decors and a small attached bar.
Staffs r well uniformed, courteous, friendly (one of them was really funny), provide suggestions and communicative to maximize your comfort and serve better.
We ordered one mocktail guava hari mirch; though i didn't try it but my friend liked it becoz of the chilli kick.
I was suggested to try mai tai; it was refreshingly sweet and strong "Chota packet bada dhamaka".
We also tried kamikaze shooter; lemoni vodka shots. Just perfect after pasta. 👌👌
Now comming to food, as starters we had polo con aioli, chicken with garlic meyo; its served with a bread crisp and salad. Though the chicken was a little bit chewy but tastes good. It is milder than chicken 65 so our server suggested to have it first. Now really loved the chicken 65. Its sauce was really good, spicy and tangy, just great combo with my mai tai.
For mains we opt for mixed sauce pasta, formaggio chicken; i am not much a mixed sauce type but this one was really tasty and highly recommended. But i must say as per quantity it was too much for two. As it was lip smackingly delicious so we managed to complete the whole plate.
Though we were already full but there were always a place for dessert so we had sizzling brownie with icecream; and it can't get wrong. Hot walnut brownie with cold melting vanila icecream , pure ❤.
One of the must visit eatery in Kolkata; atleast once.
But for me i gonna visit again definitely.

This place is located exactly opposite to Nazrul mancha(Rabindrasarobar). Alomg with my 4 friends, I visited this place today at around 7:30p.m. in the evening and managed the poolside table somehow. The service was awesome and the environment too. For hangout with friends, this is an absolutely perferct place. Only con is that its a little congested.

I visited back in May.
I didn't find it really great. The staff people are not really into helping you and they didn't give us the outside seat even though on grounds that pre-booking is required. What is the use of going there if you gotta sit inside.
Coming to the food, we ordered a hawaian pizza which is sufficient for two.
And a blue lagoon and Virgin mohito.
The latter was a better optipn.
Pocket pinch is 1000 for two. 
And do book to not face problems.

Being a resident of Delhi which sets a high standard for bars and pubs, this particular restro-pub didn't seem to disappoint. One could easily miss this place because of its small entrance, but once you are in, you will definitely revisit this place.

Talking about service, this place is almost up to the mark. The waiters could be seen in their uniforms, attending to you the moment you step in. They will even inquire you about your sitting preferences (outside or inside or in the section where you can smoke Hookah). Their service is quite prompt, and by that, I mean the serving time of your ordered food. Though I thought that the way the food was served on your plate could have been better. 

Coming to food, we ordered beer and along with that crispy chilli chicken, formaggi pasta (a mixed sauce variant), and the first bite of the food assures you about the rest of their dishes. These two dishes in particular was very delicious. The chicken was tender, cooked to perfection with the right mixture of spices and sauce. The pasta too was mouth-watering. The quantity and the blend of mixed-sauce and seasonings was just perfect! The plus point is their presentation of the food. 

The ambiance inside was also nice. The view of the Kolkata high-rises with a clear surrounding just complements your booze! Plus it was raining the day i visited. The seating is quite comfortable, cozy and spacious. They have made sure you get a view of the Kolkata skyline from wherever you sit.

Altogether a nice experience! Definitely visiting again.
P.S. Try the outdoor seating.        
       The place is quite friendly on pocket
@What's up keep up the good service! Cheers!!

Highly dissapointed with their service and hospitality. First of all there was no place to sit in the open roof top area. They said that they will shift us as soon as it is available...we agreed and chose a place to sit..then they moved us to another seat, in a couple seat, however other couples were sitting in 4seat tables without being disturbed. Mind you...there was no one waiting for the seat we were asked to leave...Next we ordered starters and soup...food was good...but they did not even bothered to put a glass of water, unless until we asked for it...then we ordered mocktail and hard drinks...after finishing half of the drink they provided the snacks..what kind of a service is that?..spent more than an hour...we did not get a seat in the rooftop..but we found new people easily going in... because they were more than 2...So please guys if u don't have enough couple seat have the guts to say that.. why did you promised us to give a seat? You just wasted our time by giving false hope...we were so pissed off that we didn't feel like having the main course. Being born and brought up in Kolkata and having visited so many restaurants in the city till date...this is my worst experience. Trust me there are hell lot of better places in Kolkata at this price with awesome food and hospitality. Would never like to visit or recommend.

Well. I headed to this 'thing' to have a great evening and try something out new. But what happened after that is beyond my imagination. The ambience felt like I'm waiting outside of Google's interview board. Service was of the worst quality I have ever seen in kolkata. Come on guys you are supposed to give more with that high bandwidth of price. Being frustrated with everything I ordered drinks (screwdriver). Man! That was the stupidest cocktail I ever had. Snacks came up 10-30mins after drinks were served. I have a suggestion for the administration, go to the Spice craft restaurant (it's not far from you) and learn how to make cocktails and serve them to your customers.
I'm so frustrated by this restaurant that I just have to say, be professional guys, you are not giving grace to anyone by serving. I just wasted my 2hrs of evening on you and decided not to go there ever.

I had hit this place during the Durga Puja and hence off course it was quite over crowded and we had to wait for sometime. But it was nice experience. Didn't get a nice view from the top as we got our seat at the Bar counter. The food was nice. We tried the chicken pizza, sangria​ and tiramisu. I loved the Sangria and the Tiramisu as I have a sweet tooth. Live music added to the experience. I had a lovely time and look forward to visit this place yet again in near future.

Visited this place with my family friends a few days back. There were people already waiting outside. We had to wait around 10mins outside, but I would say it was worth the wait. We took a rooftop table. The view was superb. The service was slow, but that was understandable considering the place was packed. 
So about the food. I don't remember the names of all the dishes we ordered, but all the dishes were very tasty. The chicken Caesar salad was delicious. The virgin pinacolada was also yummy.
We were there for birthday celebration of my aunt, so I informed the waiter to get us a cake with a candle on it. He suggested the blueberry cheesecake, so that is what we got. When we got the cake it had a candle on it and the plate was decorated with happy birthday written on the side. Also they played happy birthday song on the stereo while she cut the cake. The service in the end made us very happy. Overall a very positive experience. :)

If they had an option of negative rating , this place would lead the way .
One of the worst places to go.

1) The entrance is so shady that one wouldn’t want to enter .
2) The building has 1  lift with a strict rule of carrying  4 people including the lift man. 
3) Their staff just don’t know how to behave . 
4) The entire place has this weird disgusting smell.


I don’t even want to start with the service and food. 

One should just not visit this place if they are looking to have a good experience .

This is probably one of the most hyped places in south kolkata at the moment. This place is primarily Known for its roof top access and jacuzzi table. It’s a good place to chill with friends on a winter evening. We ordered kebabs, lasagna and pasta. Kebabs and lasagna were good. However, the portion was way to small and definitely not worth it. The service here is a bit slow.. overall it’s a nice place to hangout at but not such a great place for dining.

The place is known for its open air atmosphere, Jacuzzi, view of the Lake from the sixth floor.  Its divided into many sections, wherever your heart wants you can enjoy. Ambience was soothing. We had on yhe roof top, that section is small. Service is fine. Food was okay, not so great. We had ordered for Shisha, crispy chilli Babycorn, Veg. Mix sauce pasta, Nachos, Kiwi Mojito, Kit-Kat shake. Mojito was good. Pasta was very spicy, so need to be corrected once after saying before, the changes weren't made.

It's on the sixth floor located near the popular vivekananda park. 
This place is known for their Jacuzzis, the open air atmosphere and the view of the lake from the sixth floor.
We were unfortunate that it was raining and couldn't get a seat outdoor. 
Anyway, ordered meat lover's pizza. 
It was a thin crust pizza with 8 slices. The dough was decent and there were ample cheese too. 
Would love to try their outdoor seating some other time.

One of the popular roof top restaurant in Kolkata. Talk of the town always because of its ambience and it deserves to get that famous. The ambience is impressive with both indoor and outdoor seating, people prefer more the outdoor one. Decors are done perfectly matching the aura of the place. 

Since mostly I tried their cocktails, drinks and finger foods. I was happy enough with their service and the quality of food served. Everything is upto the mark, people must not miss the rooftop view while munching on some foods.

Best of luck Team What's Up !!

The ambience is nice enough. Being on the sixth floor it has a good view. The part of the pub that is on the open roof is also pretty nice, albeit a tad warm (that is where the bizzare foot dipping pool thingie comes in handy I am guessing). The only thing issue is the presence of this tiny, lonely and sad lift which is so small that it only takes up/down three people at a time!

It is overhyped first of all. If you are lucky enough on weekends then only you can enjoy the place. The place on picture looks very big but in actual the place is very congested. Lift was horrible as it takes only 3 people at a time.. so in weekend you have to wait in a queue for lift. No waiting area. So you have to wait on stairs and stair is not at all spacious so you may get pushed by other people.
After half an hour waiting we get a place in normal area not in rooftop. After multiple requests we get the place in rooftop under stairs. The place was not at all comfortable as the sound box would be just above your head and behind the table place is for waiters.
Now about the food. The food was really nice. We have ordered chicken roulade, chicken tikka kebab, chicken banjara kebab, Shepherds pie and crispy icecream balls. Rating is only for the food.

Good to see a pub like this at Kol. The entrance to the pub is not good apart from the guitar lighting but I think this is fine because in Kol I have seen places like this. The ambience is beautiful but the area is very small, esp. the terrace area. So better to avoid crowded weekends. The walls are made of glass which looks amazing and the stairs also. So better to wear pants or jeans if you have booked on the rooftop. There is a seating arrangement below the stairs also which didn't make sense to me. Food is good, I especially liked the chilli chicken fry. We ordered pizza, Spanish omelette, creamy chicken bruschetta, chilli chicken crispy fry and noodles wrapped chicken. Among all these, l liked Spanish omelette and chilli chicken fry. They gave a good filling on top in  bruschetta but since I don't like creamy chicken so it tasted ok. But if you like creamy chicken then you will like it. Hawaiians pizza was ok. Overall food is in between ok and good. Overall ambience is good especially for the terrace and rooftop. Highchairs are little uncomfortable when you  feel like relaxing and having a drink on roof top. Staff was polite and courteous. Overall it was a good experience. To come up with a concept like this in Kol  I will give 5 marks extra.

Visited the place with friends last night . It was my first time when I was visiting this place and I was excited as I live out of of kolkata and I have been seeing the pictures all these days . But honestly I am disappointed with the overall experience . I am satisfied with the food and service which they are offering . But the problem is with the atmosphere . The way they are doing the propaganda you will have the impression that it's a silent and quiet place where you can sit and enjoy the rooftop view along with food and booze . But the reality is these place is too small to adjust your selves .which makes the place too much clumsy and noisy and you will miss the silent beauty of the rooftop .

We sat on the lawn adjacent to smoking room.One problem was that the space was too cramped up.Chairs and tables have lesser leg spaces.
 
I would love to visit again.

Good view that's totally wasted and ruined by extremely poor service! Perfect example of an evening going wrong! 

We visited on a Wednesday about a week before Pujo. We went pretty early and had a terrible experience. Moved on to another rooftop experience and never visiting this place again.

What we hated:

1. The service was extremely poor

2. Upselling

3. The manager was hovering past every now and then. He seemed to be least bothered about people waiting. It seemed like he wanted to make everyone hurry, ruining the experience for others around. What's the point of a good view if you are being rushed before you can finish your meal and have a decent conversation?

4. A young couple in the queue wanted to enquire about availability of seats and though there were 2 empty tables next to us, without any reservation board, they were flatly refused. More than the refusal, the behaviour was shocking! When they asked why, the manager left rudely without answering! And this was by the manager so what do you expect from the team! I don't think he was aware that we noticed.

5. The staff were slightly better. However, there was a lady and a guy in the front desk who were busy with their stuff and chitchat instead of attending to those who were asking about seat availability.

6. Too crowded, tables so close by  that you can overhear conversations. Add to that average food, expensive dishes that you cannot quite enjoy given the circumstances.

What we loved:

1. The view and the decor

2. Some of the dishes ( finger food) were good, hookah too!

3. The liftman - smiling, helpful, friendly and asking about everyone's experience, even apologised to those who complained, those who were waiting for the lift. There was a lot of unloading of heavy soundboxes etc going on in the ground floor but he tried his best to manage the staff, the parked cars and make way for the guests. Kudos to his efforts, warm welcome, hospitality! 

Now either it's a new team, or just hard luck but the place I had heard great reviews about simply disappointed me! And guys, a little smile and a bit of good manners won't kill you. Unhappy employees lead to unhappy customers!

I maybe wrong but it seemed like they simply do not care about customers or good service, given their popularity. There was a recent discussion about their deteriorating service in the Calcutta Foodies Club on FB and majority of the foodies seemed to agree, please feel free to check it out on the public forum.

Some things are classic you know like good service, like asking for feedback, like a simple apology to people who waited and left, simple things that show you care. And even if things go wrong, a polite conversation can make all those straight if you care enough. In this digital age when experiences can be summed up in videos, photos, reviews and blogs and shared with millions - instances like these happen only in fools' paradise. 

Sorry about the bad review, for spreading the bad word! And thanks to you, we found a perfectly romantic rooftop restaurant that more than made up for all these!

Its been long I have been wanting to visit this place and what could have been better than husband's birthday. Since the place is always full, we had to wait a little. Weekends are overcrowded. The restaurant is quite huge with inner area, bar area, outer area and hookah area and must to mention pool tables. Good music, great food and drinks, awesome view, superb service. We ordered Classic Cheese Fondue Platter, Lime flavoured Thai Corn Noodles, Chicken Roulade, Virgin Pinacolada and Beer. Everything was great! Would surely visit again.

On 24 th Sept 2017, we went for Dinner ,there's 11 heads when 1 called up in morning to reserve table,they denied.. So we went there earlier to avoid queue but still we had to wait almost an hour. Finally we got a place at rooftop, nice view...
We ordered: 
1. Pan fried chilly fish ( 4.5/5): They served 8 standard pcs in a plate. 
2.  Chicken Garlic cheesy kebab (5/5): As the menu has changed i cant find the exact name of that chicken item.. Soft, well marinated 8pcs of chicken , cheese spinkled over it engances its taste..
3. Chichen 65 (4.5/5): Not like normal 65 but more of chilly chicken.. 8pcs of chicken balls.
4. Chicken lover pizza with ham stuffed in it (4.5/5): 
We requested them to make 10 slice, they said they will do it on table..but they didn't...
5. Key west cooler cocktail (4.5 /5) : Balanced sweet and tangy taste
6. Alxender borbourn ( 4/5) : To strong to subpress other flavour..
7. Mojito  : Not tried personally , liked by my friends ..
8. 3 - 30ml Vodka and 5 beer ordered by friends
Bill was approx more than Rs. 10,000.. And that was real pinch on pocket.. In other places park st we could have ordered some main course in this budget 
Hard Drink and Cocktail price is quite high here as compared to other places.... In there new menu I found they have increased it to around Rs. 50-100 each ..
Surprisingly the server dont except Tips.. They returned us the tip we paid... In few restaurent whether they serve u properly or not adds 10-12 % of service charge but here they refuses.. 
Overall this place is excellent and the quality and quantity of food is also good, they should just think about the price so that it become pocket friendly and so that people can visit there frequently...

I went there with my husband & the experience was disgusting.. one of the attendants was so mean.. he didn't let us enter to the roof/jacuzzi area, saying that it's filled up but we could see that there was a lot of vacant space. If not,he should have let us see for ourselves. But he kept on insisting that there was no place outside in a rude manner.. **** I AM TOO MUCH DISAPPOINTED & CONDEMN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR*****

Went to this place along with my high school teacher! It was her treat. The place is really nice with a cozy decor. However the rooftop part us really small. This is not the kind of place one should visit if you want to sit and talk to an old friend over nice food. This is more like exchanging glances in loud music and maybe lean in to whisper something in the ear of your partner kind of place. We ordered Chicken Roulade and Bekti Fish Fingers. Chicken Roulade was just amazing. 

Live music in the evening can be extremely enjoyable! 

Decor : 8.5/10
Food: 7.5/10

We went on a Sunday night and it was so bad. I will start from the beginning . We had to wait outside for 20 min then they shifted us to the bar area where we had to wait for another 30 min. And we were not given seats until we order the food or drink. Then we finally get a seat after 45-50 min and 5times Roaming throughout the place. We ordered cheese fondue and garlic noodles. The fondue was not even got it was cold. The noodles were so spicy we couldn't eat. The waiters were nice whereas the receptionist was very rude. So in all a bad experience.

Visited this place on a Sunday evening at about 6:30. After a long wait got to the bar counter and yes it was worth the wait. At a glance we really liked the interiors. The bar tenders welcomed us with a nice smile. My parents were probably the oldest of the lot surrounded by mostly college goers but they didn't feel out of place. The staffs' behaviour was nice, helped us with suggestions on what we should order to drink n eat. Later they got us a table with nice view of the city. Overall experience was really good.

I am sorry for the poor review but its for the food and drink only. Only ambience is not everything that's what I must say. I had very high hopes after I read so many good reviews about this place. Saved money and was so eager to visit this place. The interior is nicely decorated specially the bar place and exterior. We ordered bloody Mary and caprioska with starters bruschetta with creamy chicken and a veg cutlet. The drink arrived 15 mins after the ordered time, it was so poorly made that we ordered a beer to change th
e taste. The food arrived after 30mins but we were ready to wait. The cutlet was nicely presented but it was harder. The bruschetta was so bland that instead of fighting over food we we're asking each other to finish the plate.. we paid hugely and left with a bad taste promising never to return again.

When friends come to your city for vacation or for any other purpose you need to have a good place to hang out..this place does complete justice to it..

Was fighting with a friend as to why he chose a place so far..but it was worth the visit..

We sat on the terrace front..and the view across the city was mesmerising..

Food - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
Cost - 3/5(not very costly)
Ambience - 4/5

Loved - the platter,potato wedges,whats up desi pizza,mixed sauce pasta

Cons - too crowded at times and gets a bit congested..kitkat shakes was okay.

Should visit with your friends 🙂

Winter is coming and what can be a better place than rooftop section of what's up to get soaked in afternoon sun and sipping your poison with delicious continental foods!

LOCATION

It's on Southern Avenue, just opposite to the Lake entrance.

AMBIANCE

It has both covered section and roof top, which is again separated for smokers and non smokers. If it's not hot and humid in outside, go for the rooftop section and enjoy the beauty of kolkata from above! Rooftop section is really the one to go for

FOOD

To start with our beer, we had ordered 

NACHOS WITH  CHICKEN TOPPINGs - It came with plateful of Nachos, spicy chicken to add, kidney beans sauce( I was expecting black bean though) and Sour cream. Taste wise it was good, nothing extra ordinary to mention

CHICKEN AND HAM LASAGNA - This was the star of the show. It had minced chicken and ham with good portion of cheese and very nicely blended together. Taste was perfect, texture was creamy and was smelling good too!

GRILLED CHICKEN IN RED WINE SAUCE - The portion of this dish was really big, I had to struggle to clean my plate but the taste helped me here! chicken breasts were perfectly grilled and soaked with red wine sauce, mashed potato was creamy and vegetables were nicely sauted. I would liked to have broccoli instead of cauliflower though!

Overall a nice place to spend some quality time with quality food and ambiance. Remember good things come with a price tag though!

Its a crazy place in a good way. Even on a dry day there was waiting for 15 mins. They have good options for food and drinks. The place is equally popular with family and youngsters. They score pretty high for their ambience and live music. The only problem that l faced was they weren't ready to take a reservation.

When to this place few days ago on a sunday.
The ambience is good with lightings which look like tap etc.
There is out door sitting too.
Food quality is good and service is excellent.

But the place is in an official building that too situated in the top floors. And the lift is very small which carries only 4 ppl and out of which 1 is occupied by the lift man and waiting is not proper, one has to wait on the stairs.

So I suggest this place coz of the ambience and food quality but am scared about the croud management of the place.

Location: Southern Avenue Opposite to Nazrul Mancha.

I was here with a few friends to have some drinks and grab a bite.

Ambience and Dećor: The ambience is of course top notch because it is a roof top place giving an amazing view of the city.The inner seatings dećor is also good,simple nothing fancy.

Food and Drinks:

Beer: We opted for the beer bucket,we got 5 beers at the price of 4 but we had to opt for kingfisher lager as fosters and carlsberg were
not availble.

Shisha: The shisha was good and long lasting but it was too expensive. 500+ Tax.

Hawaiian Pizza: The pizza was really good and very tasty and fresh. I loved the pizza.

Complementary Cake: It was their 2nd birthday so they were giving each of the tables complementary cakes on their behalf and to my surprise the cake was really tasty. Big thanks to them for that.

Service: The service was ok but the staff were courteous and really well behaved.

I liked the place and everything about it but it is really very pricey specially the hookah.
Recommended if you have a decent budget.

We ordered Hawaiian pizza, chicken roulade, mac n cheese, chicken hakka noodles, caprioska and dairy milk shake. Was disappointed with two things only- caprioska and tiramisu. Other items were satisfactory and in good quantity.

I had this place bookmarked in Zomato since a really long time!
Our much awaited plan for visiting What's Up suddenly happened when we decided to have lunch here after a tiring night in!
This place spans across a big area.. more than being big.. I think the way they have utilized the space is amazing.. with the indoor & outdoor seating.. seperate bar.. lovely!
The view it provides from the 6th floor is mindblowing.. the beautifully done interiors add cherry on the cake.
We ordered-
Chicken caesar salad
Shredded chicken & mushroom soup
American chop suey (chicken)
Fresh lime soda
Honestly speaking..I think I had the best food I've had in a while. Period.
Courteous staff.. the manager himself visits every table asking about the food.
I totally loved What's Up!!
Would love to pay a second visit very soon.. preferably in the evening this time ❤

Happy eating 😊

Opt for the rooftop seating arrangement with the jacuzzi. Decor is quite good as well. The food is really delicious & they make it look beautiful with their garnishing style. Loved the Bruschetta.
They only offer drinks to legal age people so watch for it!
Surely a place to visit again for me.

Nice ambience.......but lacks in a few areas like the professionalism of the waiters. They don't charge less for the food but they do not use up to the mark crockery and cutlery.

Overpriced place with worst service. Food served was nothing extraordinary as per the price. We ordered Nachos which they just bought a packet of it and served with minimal garnishing. Although the open space was empty but they refused to give that place to us saying that it has been reserved. Overall I felt that they are actually taking a much higher price compared to the food and service they are providing, also ambience is not so good. Wouldn't recommend anyone if you're genuinely looking for a good rooftop restaurant/cafe.

Don't go into a restaurant and expect that just the food should be good. You are not doing your hard earned cash justice with this mindset. The ambience should be great, the service should be effortless and you should not be aware of how time flew by because you were having so much fun. What's Up cafe does not score more than average on any of these parameters.

We came in on Panchami, and wanted to book a table beforehand. After calling them they insisted that rush is crazy from 7:30-9:30pm so no table was guaranteed to us. We walked in at 9:30 and were able to get a table inside since we were not interested in hookah. I'll probably sound a little spoilt but the insides were cramped - no negative points since real estate can't be helped. The "best server" was assigned to us with the words "he knows the menu inside out" - from the restaurant manager (?). It was a little surprising that the manager himself was not very familiar and comfortable with the menu.

We decided to start off with nachos, tequila shots, virgin pina colada and a what's up special fruit drink. Tequila is so expensive here! Drink at home unless you just inherited a fortune. The pina colada was served warm! How does one even make such an amateur mistake?! It had to be returned and they took forever to make it right. The fruit punch wasn't bad. The nachos - the less said the better. We were served nacho chips from some packet (pretty sure they don't make their own) and it was served with salsa, sour cream (except that it had the most odd consistency and taste) and some mystery white sauce. The chicken it came with was pathetic. Avoid this dish at all costs!

For mains, we decided to order these earlier than we would have liked since they were taking their own sweet time serving the dishes. We had pesto pasta with chicken and the panini chicken sandwich. The mains were thankfully a bit better - the pasta was pretty decent. I recommend getting pesto sauce when you don't want the overwhelming tomato flavour from the red sauce yet want a decent creamy taste without too much cheese. The sandwiches were decent and served with fries. Must say that strong usage of mustard oil while cooking chicken made it a bit interesting.

Overall, a lot can be done to improve service. A hookah paying customer should not get preferential treatment over a non-hookah one. Unless you're in the mood to flush money down the drain, don't have the nachos.

Tip - the inside part of the restaurant has music playing at a decent volume so not bad for a family meal. But this place is more geared towards the young crowd. I am not going to return enthusiastically.

It's one of the coolest place I have ever been to..
It was a sudden plan with school friends meeting after a long time and what a time we had!!
It's on the 6th floor and naturally gives you a wonderful view of the city! It's a very busy place but accordingly well managed. We ordered not much because we didn't have much time...so ordered 3 mocktails one cold coffee and French fires.. 
All the mocktails were quite refreshing and so was the cold coffee.. 
The ambience is what you will fall in love with! Wonderful view, cool breeze, great service and you have areas where you dip your legs in water while chatting with friends.. and yes, they do have good music too!!! The area is well decorated and well lit. Especially the bar area where you see aquarium all around you! 
Overall...it's a very nice place and I am definitely hanging out there again!

A view to kill for 
Located adjacent to the lake on southern avenue 
Has a rooftop sitting arrangement 
Went on with a couple of friends on Thursday afternoon
You can have a decent view of the night sky if Kolkata up from here .
They hit us with cocktails like jaggerbomb,  LIIT, Sex on the beach , screwdriver and hurricane and all of them were to the point 
For food we had quattro formaggi pizza and lasagne
The food quality is great but portion is a bit less for the price .

PS : if you really want to chill after hectic office hours to some catchy music , cool natural breeze And water spa 
This is the place.

A rooftop café, with the speciality of an breathtaking view, especially if you go on a rainy day. 
The food, though a bit costly, is quite tasty! Don't go by the picture on the menu card/tab, they usually differ.. Nonetheless, the taste remains awesome! 

Ordered the chef special spaghetti, was indeed satisfied. 

Planning to revisit it during the winters!

Went on Navami when they have restricted menu but then serving the best.. Customers were welcomed with pujor dhak.. 
Ambience - Amazing with good music. They had both soft and rock song music option depending on the sitting area.

Food (veg) - I ordered Cottage Cheese Steak with Butter Rice with Virgin Pinacolada. Pinacolada was okish whereas Steak was superb and a must have.

Service - It was a nice experience and the staffs were polite, understanding and professional.

          We ordered a 4+1 tuborg, chicken reshmi kabaab and roasted chicken sandwich. every item was so good. very happening place. the roof top is so smartly arranged. loud music was going on which was creating the party mood. staffs were very careful towards all the visitors.

This restaurant is the talk of the town now. This place is opposite of Nazrul Macha southern avenue. There is a small entrance a lift man is there to take u up to the 6th floor nd yup here u find the restaurant. This restaurant has 4-5 segment 1st indoor sitting area, 2nd bar, 3rd roof top area with a jacuzzi nd 5 tables nd there is a glass stair once u'll climb up d stair u'll gonna see another rooftop sitting area. The staffs nd manager are really friendly nd well behaved. We went there in tym of durga puja so d place was crowded. Staffs manage the crowd so well. We got a place in the rooftop area bt after 5 min rain has started so we cme bck to the indoor sitting area. We ordered some drinks , moctails, pizza ,fries, quality of the food was good , atmosphere was perfect. Though the price is lil bit costly bt its worthy . So we r gonna cme bck again 😊

This place is the talk of the Town! Any person residing in South Kolkata would know it's location. It's located just opposite to the nazrul manch in southern avenue. The lift man will take you up to the sixth floor. The entrance is small but it opens up to a whole new different world. There are a total of 5 sections. The first section is a restaurant area. The second section is the bar area, the third section is the roof top area which has a Jacuzzi and 4-5 tables with high chairs. You climb up the stairs and again it's another rooftop area with a fewer sitting setups and then it's an indoor restaurant cum bar area. It was sunny so we couldn't opt for either the Jacuzzi or the rooftop areas. We had to wait for around 15-20mins just to get a place indoor.
I would like to mention that the manager and the staffs are really friendly and well mannered. They know how to handle the crowd. There are very few restaurants who has such friendly and lively staffs. Even while we were waiting, they kept us entertained. We went during puja, so there was a rush. But hats off to these people for managing the crowd so well.

Coming to the food, we ordered for a chicken Caesar salad and the chicken roulade. We ordered the key West cooler and the cosmopolitan as suggested by one of their staffs. Both the cocktails we're fantastic. Suited our taste. Cranberry was the main ingredient and the concoction was smooth.
The chicken Caesar salad was served in a huge quantity. Lots of chicken pieces, olives, bread pieces. It tasted really good. The chicken roulade was served in a less quantity but the taste justifies why it's a favourite. This is a must try if you're coming to What's up.
I had a wonderful time here. Gonna come back again for a seat on the rooftop.

Well the dishes were too good nd was value for money.Also had Pina colada nd lime soda to accompany with. The main highlight of the place is the view it offers.We went at the time of dusk and the terrace view was breathtaking.A must visit for all foodies. I am planning for another visit very soon..

To start with, KUDOS to team What's Up.

We visited this place on Shoptomi evening.

The staff were super friendly. The manager too was polite and he ensured that we feel comfortable as we were a group of ladies only. 
The service was prompt. We loved the ambience- the breathtaking view of my city, the live music on the background. SUPERB!
We settled for beer, crispy chilli chicken and meatlover's pizza. Food tasted great. Quantity was enough too.
However, the price is a bit expensive but that is alright given the experience to spend quality time in this place.

Definitely coming back very soon. 😃

Went there on a crowded Saturday evening. Got seat after a 5 min wait. Waiters were patient and gracious even with so much crowd, which is rare in Kolkata. Food we ordered was a non-veg tandoori platter which included 5 different varieties of chicken and prawn. Second dish was Turkish boat chicken pizza which was also nice. 
We didn't have their signature cocktails (a bit overpriced), just had regular beer and Bailey's Irish Cream. 
Reasonable bill and no extra  service charges. Even a tip of ₹100 was returned to us as it's a no-tip zone.
Overall a good experience.

Chicken 65 with a twist - the taste was awesome
French fries - it was a hell lot of fries and the presentation was very cute
Fish fingers - it was okayish
pan fried chilli fish - again it was awesome
KitKat shake - normal shake
The ambiance is just awesome. And we tried the jacuzzi too once it was empty. The staff were super friendly.

First of all, it is located on the 6th floor of the building but with a lift which can carry only 4 persons including lift man so need to wait a long time to avail the lift.
Now coming to the ambience, this place is only for the people who would like to swim and indulge in smoking,drinking,loud music.It has a terrace and a roof top arranged for the same but the inside place is also full of loud music which makes it impossible to have peaceful gossips(Adda) with friends.My experience says it is not for family outings for dinner but its purely a pub and the ambience says so.
Now coming to the food which was good - the only thing not to complain about.
Would definitely not keep this place in my option for my future outings.
Specially went to enjoy the food and masti with roof top ambience to see the kolkata lights but the lesser space with over crowded people having smoke and hookah just failed me..

Coming to food, we ordered
Chicken 65 with a twist which was tasty
Milk shake with ice cream (which when the waiter showed the tab menu, looked different and the order came was different, so they said that's just picture) and it tasted really good
Also had the Chef's special Lebanese spaghetti, must have, it was by far the best spaghetti i had

Last Friday one of my husband's frnd has gave us his birthday treat on what's up. The place is perfect for hanging out with frndz in weekend, environment of this place will surely refresh you from all your stress carried out through the full week. The place has the rooftop seating area along with ac rooms. Jacuzzi seating arrangement shows us the greate innovative sense of the owner. Center of attraction of this place is the live music, that will blow your mind so quickly that we will not able to leave the place easily. We had ordered chicken cheese ball and fish fingers as for starter. They served the fish fingers with french fries so we can call the dish fish and chips. In main course we had ordered noodles with chilli chicken. Quantity is very good there ,1 bowl of noodles is more than enough for two person. Taste was really good but it's little bit spicy. Service was quite good and fast as per the crowd in Friday night. I will suggest to go this place at the early evening so that you can spend more time there which will refresh you for the weekend.

SERVES FOOD WHILE YOU RELAX YOUR FEET. I visited this place in August and loved the concept of enjoying the food with your legs in water.

One of the fancy places in the town, with variety of food and drinks. 

I had the following dishes:

•Chilly Paneer: 5/5. Perfect dish
•Chicken Roulade: 5/5, well cooked chicken with crispy layer and stuffed chesse. 
•Stuffed Cottage Cheese Crest Pizza: 2/5, the pizza was dry and the sides were filled with raw paneer. It was one there speciality but failed to justify 
•Sangria: 4/5 

OVERALL: 3.5

SERVICE: 3/5

AMBIENCE: 5/5

The service is slow. The way to reach to the restaurant, located at 6th floor, is through lift which can carry only 4 people at a time or through stairs.

Just opposite Nazrul Manch on 6th floor of the building, this is one of the city's best rooftop bar. There's ample seating area, inside and outside and a bar counter. It may seem narrow and stuffy....but it's quite cozy. I must say, the view is awesome.
There's duplex rooftop with another covered area. There's even a seating area with Jacuzzi!
Music played here is mostly English pop and rock.
There's live music most of the nights which goes on till 10:30pm. The performers mostly sing unplugged medleys on guitar in Hindi, English and Bengali.
Food is really delicious here, and quantity is enough for two person. We (4person) had Fish n Chips and a chicken kebab for starters, two bowls of egg noodles, and a chilly chicken with couple of drinks. The bill was 5k. Be warned, they tend to make the gravy dishes very spicy!
Waiters were nice & polite and service was fast.
I really liked the interiors and decor. Its funky as well as classy. The crowd was a mixed bag with people of all ages. It was mostly posh people but not too snobby or pretentious and the right amount of intellectual ;). There were a couple of foreigners too.
In conclusion, I can't wait to visit again!

A Friday evening started off rather well when the amiable lady at the gate told us very nicely that the requested terrace seats might not be available but she'll try her best. And she got us three seats on the terrace.

We sat at a table here we were told that it was meant for a larger group and we were moved to the next table. Before even ordering the same staff gave the same table to three people but different people. Probably they didn't like our faces enough to give us those seats.

Next a friend was asked to not smoke while sitting at the table. Apparently you have to stand and smoke near the ashtray which was less than an arms length from where we were sitting.

I quite liked the ambience and the beer temperature. The service is the easier part. It doesn't take much to smile and be nice about things. It's called hospitality for a reason.

It seemed to me a failed attempt at creating a hep place to attract young crowd. The ambience is great but the seating is neither adequate nor comfy. But most importantly they need a good bartender. I ordered two different cocktails giving them a second chance, but both were equally disappointing. The staff however is friendly and helpful.

Sigh! I don't know what to tell about this one. Unfortunately it felt terrible being there and we literally regret our decision to visit that place. Everything was awful. The location is weird. You can't even have the views as it shows u in here. The food was expensive. And when we finally got the food,my god! It got me into tears 😔 ..very poor quantity. Sadly we had to visit an other eatery to feed our hunger. 😏 disappointed!!

To start with, you might not get to see the view that the photos promise. There are a lot of different options from seating- two indoor sections, the bar(which is pretty trippily done), one outdoor lower terrace, where there the jacuzzi seating option as well, then there's a higher terrace, on which again u get outdoor and indoor options. But for each different variety the capacity is so low that essentially more often than not you will be forced to sit in something other than your preference choice. Needless to say, the view is the best from the higher terrace outdoor area and that's the picture they have put up here.
The ambience is nice, service could be faster, staff is polite and attentive.
We liked the cheese fondue with popcorn chicken. The most interesting thing was the cocktail I started with. I wanted to order a particular cocktail on menu which wasn't available, so I told him my preferences and asked him to give me a bar-tender special. He came back with a perfect concoction, keeping with my preferences and, wait for it, with a green chilli! Yes I was shocked too, but it turned out really nice. I would surely like to try out more cocktails in that place.
Since we failed to get seats at the top we were seated outdoor on the lower terrace, beside the jacuzzi seating. There would invariably be a noise group over there at that table...I think it would have been nice if they had a separate area for bigger tables (read noisier tables)
Overall, an interesting experience, might visit again to try out different seatings, more cocktails and the live performance we missed.

Well what do you know the world is round. Oh! you knew that, well you can verify it from this rooftop restaurant and bar. Spoiler Alert! here is the main attraction they got a jacuzzi where you can sit on and enjoy the food along with your favorite drink. And yeah! its a hell of a view out there.

5/5 for Ambiance.

A perfect place for boozers. Well apparently you get every drinks available here. Remember to ask twice or if you are denied of some remember to ask other stewards they might serve you the same. There is serious a lack of conduct sometimes. You might be denied of the jacuzzi even its empty.

2.5/5 for Conduct.

This place not pinch but might burn your pocket a bit. Cost of four will take you around  12,000 INR. Yeah you see that right.

1.5/5 for expense.

The food is average and yes definitely over-priced. 

Special Highlights :-
Jagger Bomb (You don't get that every where) 
B-52 (You don't get that every where either)

3.5/5 by taste.

Moderately average service time.
3/5 by haste.

An honest recommendation to see the world up from here.
And if you are lucky enough like me, you can enjoy the jacuzzi too.

Happening new place to visit. The entrance is not quite appreciable but once you are inside the atmosphere is all charged up. The staff is extremely cordial and helpful. Finding a table takes time even on weekdays but the staff arranged seating for us at the bar counter which was appreciable. The live band performance is awesome and is really a big plus.
All I want to suggest is that the staff should be more lively specially the bar tender who needs a second helping hand desperately. Don't get me wrong the guys are trying their best but at times are really under pressure.
Overall a very good place and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. A must visit as per me !
Cheers guys for your hospitality !

Went there on a Sunday evening. First of all the elevator leading you up to the restaurant on 6th floor can carry only 4 people including liftman. You have to wait for ages to reach the top. Then waiting in queue on the stairs - no AC, minimal fans. We were seated in approx 15 mins. Had asked the guys to call the owner since we were recommended by someone to visit this place - meet the owner so that he can suggest their best items. Owner did not turn up but manager did who never showed his face to us after first introduction. From a long list of beers they had only 2 or 3 available. From a long list of food they had hardly anything available. At the end we had to settle for garlic bread, med pizza and stuffed aloo. Very average food - pizza was stinking, tandoori aloo had nothing great but garlic bread did save the day. Ambience turned out to be very ordinary compared what we had heard or thought of. Extremely poor service - took them hours to get our starters. Asked for water - we were just given a bottle without glasses. Asked for glasses they never came. Guys there are much better places in town than this one.

This place offers a wide variety of seating arrangements under the same roof - a cafe/dining, bar, pool side lounge, open air dining and also a rooftop glass house. Food is top-notch. We tried the continental and also the kebabs and had absolutely no complaints. Sizes are decent and the pricing is value-for-money. Staff are friendly and that adds to the overall warm ambience. 
Food - 4.5 | Service - 4.5 | Ambience - 4.5PS, finding the place might be tricky since there's only a small sign board (which you might miss out unless kept a close watch on) on Southern Avenue next to the Fung Shway Outlet. You have to go in there and take a lift (with long wait queues) to the top to reach What's Up.

Ambience is the best place about this joint. They have a very B'ful decor and the outdoor seating makes you feel like you are at a rooftop garden. They also have Jacuzzi tables which is a unique concept.

Location - Rooftop of a 6 floor building in Southern avenue. No valet parking available but if you manage to get a place on road, there are no parking charges.

Service - A tad slow but there was a live performance so the place was jam packed. May be that's why the service was slow. The staff otherwise was polite.

Food - Some things we ordered were very good, others were average.

# Mediterranean Pizza - Very good
# Cheese Fondue - Good
# Sczhewan Noodles - Ok, very very spicy
# Quesadillas - Super Sad
# Bruchetta - Okies 

Overall a good place when the weather is good and you want to have an outdoor seating. The live performance was really good.

Recommend - Yes

I've visited this place earlier but I haven't had such a bad experience before. Their food and drinks quality has seriously detoriated. Which is really sad because I liked the ambience and service alot. But I wouldn't recommend the place again or visit it either.

We ordered for quite a few dishes among which the most disappointing was the dessert, their fruit cheesecake which is apparently their specialty. It was inedible and looked just as bad. Their drinks were also disappointing except the cosmopolitan, their green apple mojito was too sweet and the caprioska was very bitter, and tasted only of lemon seeds and we couldn't finish both the drinks.

I wish they had maintained their food and beverage quality. It wasn't worth the amount we spent on the meal.

Located just opposite to nazrul mancha a few metres ahead from vivekananda park, this place is easy to locate. Or anyone from golpark take the route through southern avenue towards vivekananda park it will fall on your right side. The cafe is located at the 6th floor. A great place. Indeed i loved the place. This place is heaven for party lovers.
They have outside roof seating arrangements and also there are seating arrangements inside the rooms. Even they have bar counters where you can seat and hve your drinks. Hookah is all time available.
One thing that attracted me is the seating arrangement along a small pool, inside which you can put your legs enjoy your food or drinks.
On Tuesdays they have live band, which you will enjoy a lot. The singer was too good and the ambience was great.
Now coming to food and drinks.
They prepare great mocktails and cocktails.
Now comming to food quality, i must say the quality is awsome and quantity is quite a lot.
And the prices are moderate.
One must visit the place.
I bet you will love it.. 💝

Cons: We ordered for the cheesecake here, apart from several other dishes which were okay, and I wanted to stab my tastebuds till they bled. DO NOT CALL FOR THE CHEESECAKE HERE. They claimed to have seasonal fruits on it, when asked, and we were gloriously served canned sweetened fruits. Like we wouldn't know the difference.

Pros: Service was good.

Entrance to this place seems kinda shady at first but the ambience is worth it.
The terrace seating is amazing with nice views of the city. Food is excellent so say the least. It had one table where you can soak your feet in a jacuzzi, a nice touch.
We had both veg and non veg starters and they were just great.

This place is located beside Indthalia in southern avenue. This is a very good place to hangout specially in the evening. The jacuzzi is a must try during summers. The food is also nice whether its pasta pizza or just starters. Personal favourite starters being crispy chilli baby corn ( this is a must for me Everytime i go), crispy chilli chicken , Cajun chicken and fish kung pao. Recently for the last few months the ladies night on every Tuesday evening just gives me and my friends more reason to hangout. You can actually select from a wide variety of cocktails depending on the availability. Worth visiting sometime.

We had ordered for:1. Vegetable Crostini: Served with hot toppings and grated with cheese. The dish was tasty and pretty filling too. 2. Garlic pepper prawns: Yet another favourite prawn starter. Very well fried, and extremely delicious.3. Burnt ginger capsicum fried rice: This served well as the main course. 
A great rooftop lounge indeed with lovely dishes.

So , What's Up - The Much Talked About Place of The Town.
Me and my closed buddies went there yesterday to have a good time as it was my fiancees birthday. We heard about the Jacuzzi there , so we badly wanted the same.On calling the previous night , they said it's an "Early Bird Prize" 😉 . So we made an entry there by 4pm and luckily the jacuzzi was available . As we relaxed down on the jacuzzi , slowly and gradually the mood sunk in . We ordered an ultra bucket for 2 people but the usually the bucket comes with ice in every pub or cafe , here it was not . I personally called the staff and made the same to do so. Moving on the food , French fries , Green island , Tandoori chicken , chicken roulade - a whats up special , calzone pizza and club sandwich. Tht was the food part . later we ordered more buckets as the mood sat in ..

Pros :-
1.The View
2.The Feel 
3.The Jacuzzi 
4.Rooftop - Night 

Cons:-

1.The Staff - Not so good , as if they are being paid just to work not at all courteous.
2.No Parking and Shit traffic area hardly u will get a place to park your car (luckily i got a place that too after 20mints of waiting. 
3.The Lift - Uff Mahn !! Such a nice place but the Lift - thumbs down. 

Yes The Rooftop Is Really good , but there's nothing much " Wow" factor apart from The Outside seating arrangements.. Prices of few bar menu items was over priced rest was ok .. A Just A good experience ..

I went to what's up for two things. Coffee and a good view of the city. The open roof on a considerably tall building offers a fantastic view of south kolkata and sunset would be a good time to be here, as for the coffee, it makes you wonder why this place lists itself as a café at all. IT'S NOT A CAFE. It is sort of like a happening pub with EDM music and good food. The interiors are interesting and it would've been better had I been a few pints down. If it's beer and music you want, it's the place to be in south kolkata.

We chose Independence Day for our trip there. And they had a special menu ready which was awesome. Sad they had no vacancy on rooftop but the seating area was spacious and had great ambience. The music playing was so in my zone. The staff were amicable and the vibe was good. When the food arrived it seemed too pretty to devour. Though it tasted good as well. The milkshakes were hard to resist. I had two mango shakes.

Located in Southern Avenue, this lounge is not as simple as it seems. The lounge has two sides. A closed bar, and an open area. The closed bar has an excellent decor, with a complete city view. The open area is surrounded by glass walls, with a garden flooring and a fountain cum mini swimming pool table. And there's another floor at the open area, which is just crazier. The staff here is just excellent and courteous. The food here is excellent. They have a really wide choice for drinks, including draft beer too. Overall, an excellent place. Cheers!

Well ordered here schezwan bhel which is totally tasted like Chinese bhel nothing much spicy but taste was good. About pan fried noodles nothing great. Hookah was very smooth and perfect one..

Beautiful view from the top floor! Perfect place to chill with a bottle of beer/wine on a rainy evening. Their sangria did have too many fruits though. However, the view itself is worth the 4-point review.

Not upto mark. Not at all. I have seen better places. Still i am rating it for good food and drinks. First of all they should mention when the rooftop os not available. I thought such a famous place would make some arrangements on rainy evening for the rooftops. And secondly the ladies night of tuesday is upto 7:45pm whereas here it has been updated as till 8pm. And the waiers should be more cooperative and responsive. While taking orders I had to call on them twice or thrice but when it came to bill payment they came by themselves.

What's up cafe aka The Rooftop Cafe is a wonderful place to hangout with your (soul) mates.
It has got an indoor and a rooftop seating arrangement with a water pool where you can dip your feet and spice up your sip.
I tried their mock-tails, the salads ( the quantity was more than enough for us) etc. and all of them were absolutely awesome.
The staffs were no doubt courteous and they also give a round to check whether we need anything anytime.
Coming to the price, it wont burn a hole in your pocket if you choose your items wisely.

NOTE: To locate and reach the place quickly, I would recommend you to take the Golpark Route.

What's Up cafe is an absolutely budget friendly place to hangout with which completely changed the notion of rooftop restaurants being expensive.Perfect for every age group.Live music,awesome ambience,and most importantly amazing food make the place a must visit one.It has a bar,lounge,roof top segment,hookah parlour and a mini pool too.The staffs' behaviour was well and good.Coming to the food, pizzas should be tried without any doubt.

Went to this cafe on 6th August 2017 on friendship day. Waited for around 20 mins due to unavailability of table. We ordered pizza, lasagne, noodles and mocktails.
Pizza was yummy. Mocktails weren't up to the mark. Mocktails didn't taste good. Also they weren't presented nicely. A cafe of this stature should present mocktails in a proper manner.
Food was good.
Also in the lift only 4 people could go at a time, including the liftman.

The retro bar cum cafe is the best place to booze with friends or have hookah while pondering over cuisines.
It was Thursday n I ordered only veg items though I don't maintain so much of religious rules.

The first time I went to this cafe I was totally mesmerized by the view.. The decor added to the overall aesthetics, with the jacuzzi, creating a perfect ambience to relax. I have been there a number of times and have not been disappointed even once.. The food is great.. I particularly like the crispy chilli chicken, kung pao fish and American corn salt and pepper.. The cocktails are great too, my favourites being Planters Punch and Long Island Iced Tea.. Service is pretty good as long as it doesn't get really busy.. However, the servers are friendly and always ready to help u out...

One of the most talked about cafes in town. The Decor itself deserves all the hype.
The view from the top is AMAZING!
Coming to food, we tried Crispy Chilli Chicken and Shakes with Hookah and the vodka based drink Sex on the beach. Though a bit overpriced, I liked the food and the shakes. The hookah was pretty refreshing.
I don't know why they suggested Sex on the beach drink when asked their best. I found it average. I'm sure they have got better ones.

I had visited this place with high hopes and expectations of enjoying out here in the wonderful ambience it has. However, it doesn't matter how good the food of the restaurant is or how sexy the ambience is, if the staff is not courteous enough, it's an absolute dislike. I hated the staff behaviour out here. I will never visit this place again. Please train your staff to behave with customers and then come and open a restaurant/cafe!

A rooftop cafe in southern avenue. Its located on 7th floor so gives a great view from the top. A place that offers everything...hookah,jacuzzi,drinks, loud music , roof top ....so a place where one can really party and enjoy with friends. Stays packed on weekends. Given the rush they do not serve hookahs on weekends after 6pm which is little disappointing. Also the jacuzzi n roof top will be completely packed on weekends. 

Ambience- as described. Great. 
Service- good. Some servers are really nice and friendly. 
Food- okayish.
#chicken 65 with a twist- very ordinary. 
#paneer tikka- okayish.
#chicken maggi- should be improved
# chicken ravioli- nice  
# mocktails can be improved. Mojito was bad. 

Overall decent experience.

Located just opposite to Nazrul Manch, it is a pretty chic place to chill with your friends. I went on a Wednesday evening with my girl gang.Thanks to the Kolkata rain, we couldn't go to the rooftop initially. The ambience inside is alluring, with large windows by the seats for a perfect view. Later, we shifted to the rooftop. The view from there is amazing. There's a smoking zone in the corner where you have to walk down for a smoke. You will find a small pool where you can dip your feet and while sipping your drink. The live music is an excellent attraction which calls for a huge crowd even during the weekdays. The stairs lead up to the terrace where one can enjoy hookah. Food is just fine. Owing to the quantity served, the rates are okay. We had ordered for a bucket of beer(4+1). Though it was served  chilled, we expected the bucket to be filled with ice to keep the beer chilled for a longer time. The waiters were courteous and swift. In short, if you want to hang out with your friends over some beer and good music, Whatsup is a promising place.

This place is a must visit as it's worth it!
Went there,few months back for a friend's farewell and totally enjoyed the summer evening with chilled beer bucket(yes! 6 beer bottles which costs okayish)
Food we ordered:-
CHICKEN CREASER SALAD (a must try if you go there)
MARGARITA PIZZA
CRISPY CHILLY BABYCORN

Service is prompt is a good place for hangouts.

This was my first visit after I was suggested by one of my friend. Though I live in Bangalore but I am from kolkata and this place definitely on my visiting list every time I visit kolkata now onwards. I visited on 9th August 2017, initially was sitting inside due to rain disruptions every now and then but later in moved to the top floor where the hookka section was. It has got some good staffs with awesome view of lush green trees of southern avenue. They follow a no tip policy which I have personally only seen in one or two places in India but definitely never in kolkata . 
But since there is scope of improvement I have rated 4.5. Because while we were sitting, we were asked to move to different table because some big group was coming and was told by one of the staffs that they have reservation from 7:30pm and if they don't turn up in half an hour (8:00pm) they will give the table to someone else, though we then moved outside but until 8:20 (approx) people turned up for that table. That was the only unpleasant experience I felt during my maiden visit to this place.
Otherwise over all it was great experience with live Bengali folk music and the crowd was pretty decent and good one.
The food was great and the presentation of the food was also more than average as compared to some other good places in kolkata.
The staffs were very courteous and friendly with smile on the face.
Prompt service.
Hope I can convert 4.5 to 5 on my next visit. 
Keep up the good work and Kudos to the What's Up team.

What's Up is one of the popular rooftop pub in Kolkata.What's Up is located on the 7th floor at southern avenue,opposite of nazrul mancha.I've been there with my college friends on last saturday night.First of all ambience is very good,rooftop is very beautiful.Coming to food we ordered one plate tandoori chicken & one plate chicken 65 with twist.Both starters are average.There is too less food option,you may go there for drinks.Price is reasonable.Food service is too slow.In weekend there is too much crowd.

Good location with a beautiful view. Good customer service and affordable alcohol makes it a wonderful place to come spend time with your friends at. The jacuzzi table is an interesting setting in the outdoor terrace area overlooking the green southern avenue. However the wait to get up to the place by the lift that can carry only 3 people at a time( excluding one lift man) is annoying. The place doesn't rank high on the vegetarian food front either.

Obviously..rooftop...thats already attractive.. The view all around(with clear view from the sides too)is just mesmerizing for me.The seating on the inside is also good.Decor nice. And yes...the seating area where u can dip ur feet in water is sooooooooo...wonderful😍

Staff is courteous.Prompt service.Oh..that tab that they give in replacement for menu cards is cool.

Food is good.We had chicken 65 with a twist and chicken popcorn with mustard mayonnaise.Both was nice..
Good place for hangout with friends and family.

Only yes, if the lift could accommodate more people together..one has to surely wait if too many people come together as only 3people at a time can use the lift.

I would highly recommend this place...though is a bit high on pocket pinch...... That ambience is just way to awesome.

Absolutely beautiful place for the budget and the ambience. The main sitting area, right as one enters, is fully exposed to the city, which makes for a great view. The place is also on the 7th floor, which means there's a lot of sky. For people who like cloudy days and/or city lights, this place is absolutely beautiful to go to during/after sunset.

A friend and I ordered 3 desserts, the cheesecake, panna cotta, and the tiramisu. The portion sizes are very generous, and a single dessert is enough for 2 young adults. The tiramisu had amazing texture, and was flavoured just right. We shared one cup, and it lasted us a proper 40 or so minutes over conversation. The panna cotta was beautifully made, and their 'seasonal sauce' happened to be mango, so we got lucky there.

The waiter serving us was just the right combination of formal and warm, and we were genuinely satisfied with the experience. ~230 for the desserts + 18% tax is totally worth it, considering each of the desserts can feed two people.

We personally thanked the chef before leaving, and we certainly plan to visit again. Great place for a mid-tier budget. The entire pocket pinch for us was ~1.1k, which is perfectly acceptable given the ambience, service speed, and (most importantly) the quality and portion sizes. Beautiful place. Definitely recommended.

Terrible experience. The ambience was good due the roof top view. Besides that the food was terrible. Wouldn't recommend going there at all. We ordered the chicken stuffed pizza which was soggy, tasteless and lacking cheese. After this we ordered a plate of nachos. Bare minimum chips, atrocious dips and not worth a single penny. The virgin mojito (kiwi flavoured apparently) tasted like our cough syrup medicine. The only thing that was barely tolerable was the brownie shake. Overall it was a horrible experience and I definitely will not be going back.

Well awesome ambience!!! I visited with my love on a rainy evening in a cool weekday. We reached there by 8 pm yet the outdoor place was almost full.as told by other people here they actually have two floors with indoor n outdoor sittings.in a place like southern Avenue with such ambience outdoor is undoubtedly awesome but I would like to specially mention the fantastic indoor ambience as well.best place to visit with friends or your lovable one.also nice songs were being performed live! With Rafi Kishore Kumar Sanu to Shaan kk n Arijit singh.a must visit for hukka n daru loving people.coming to the food it was okeyish.but I personally felt hukka was ordinary despite of long list of ingredients. It was the hariyanvi hukka
But ultimately in bar n restaurant s ambience matters most and I can give 5/5 in that category. again must visit for party loving people

Located beside fung shway is this exquisite restaurant cum hookah parlour.
Located on the top floor of a building in vivekananda park, the terrace of this place gives a perfect view of the city.. With beautiful seating arrangements and a soothing atmosphere this place is a craze among us youths.
Visited what's up for thier shisha and pinacolada.
I really liked the arrangement where u can dip ur feet in the pool and enjoy hookah in the terrace.
Loved the flavour of the hookah, it was extremely well made. The pinacolada was the best and was very refreshing..
Though the pocket pinch was on the higher side, loved the place and i would highly recommend it.

Ambiance is truly awesome, so is the pricing and serving. Truly enjoyed the awesome view and lovely evening at our hometown visit from Delhi. However, preferential treatment towards a bigger size gang and towards celebrity is something which we found to be obnoxious. The behaviour in this regard was rude, loud and not appreciated. Please include betterment in this regard. Hence, a mere 3 star, which would have been 5 star otherwise.

Among the best cafes in town!!
Location: it's in southern avenue near to indathalia..located at the 6th floor of that building..it has an outdoor seating to which makes it so popular for it's magnificent view.
Food and staff:the staff welcomed us warmly and was too helpful in deciding the menu..we took the pesto chkn pasta(quantity and quality simply won the heart and),minced Chkn lasagna (be it the presentation the taste the quantity everything was so heavenly about it),the cheesecake (the perfect dessert with Perfect sweetness and texture)all of these came for 1200approx..which was worth the dishes.
Ambience:the soothing music would definitely make ur mood enjoy the food better.
A must try out cafe in Kolkata!!
Don't miss out

When the newest trend is all about rooftop and outdoor sitting arrangements, people following it should once try out this beautiful tavern. 
Being on the 11th floor of a building and because of its location in an area like southern avenue.. The view from the roof was awesome...pretty amazing skyline!
Coming to point we were seated in an glass catchment in the tallest section of the restro, wherefrom the entire skyline could be seen. Ambience was pretty awesome with loud music accompanied by drizzles outside. As we went during Durga puja the place was literally crowded.

Coming to food we ordered :

(DRINKS)
• Pinacolada 
• Blood Mary
• Heineken
• Tuborg

FOOD
• Chicken Arabiata Penne Pasta 
• Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce
• Fish Florentine
• Chicken Involintini

After ordering the pasta, we had to change the pasta thrice by calling the staffs as they kept us serving veg pasta every single time. After that also we were highly disappointed, as it tasted salty and extremely spicy unlike it should taste.
 
Unlike pasta, Fish Florentine was cooked till perfection, absolutely luscious... The fish melted in mouth along with the creamy buttery sauce.

Fish in Lemon butter sauce is another such dish in which a continental restro can't go wrong...as it's a classic dish. And they did it quite well...absolutely delectable. 

Chicken Involitni being a new dish, we gave it a try, although it didn't taste good to me..neither the taste of the chicken was good nor the veggies it wrapped..the sauce was the ultimate let down!

Service can slowdown on a full house.

From my experience, I can wrap it up like this... Rooftops and ambience can do wonders no doubt but staffs need to be more efficient with the taste of the basic dishes...If one pays so much, in return they expects dishes made with ultimate perfection in accordance to taste.

RATINGS :

FOOD : 3/5
AMBIENCE : 5/5
SERVICE : 3.5/5
VFM : 3.5/5
 
RECOMMENDED!

This place is one of the best places which has got rooftop areas where you can hangout and enjoy the intense view around yourself, specially when there's  an overcast sky above you. It's fresh. If you're looking for a place to hangout with your friends. And have drinks. Do visit. You won't be disappointed.

Awesome awesome awesome.... I loved the place. Both the rooftop part and the indoor part was awesome. We went today and it was a cool rainy weather, so we preferred to seat inside and that's why we got a chance to sit and have lunch beside a window outside which it was raining and it was a great view, as it was in the 6th floor the feeling was like heavenly. The food was also good. But the ambiance is best. I would love to go to this place again and again. Coming to the food, we ordered crispy chilli chicken, Chicken schezwan noodles, Grilled chicken with red wine sauce. I liked first one and the noodles. Last dish was continental. We thought to have ordered brownie but after having all 3 meals,stomach was full. So next time when will visit, will definitely order hot brownie.

What's up is the new hype of South Kolkata. It has panoramic view, good music and interesting cocktails. 
The space is not really spacious, the waiters could be more courteous and I hope they serve the food on time (before 20 minutes and not after 45 minutes).

Recommendation - The Vodka mixed cocktail "Cosmopolitan" is the new Black! Go and have it!

"What's up" as the name suggests is actually up and on 6th Floor with a nice rooftop view. There is a seating area on the inside as well for those who wanna sit in the AC. But i'll suggest to take a table outside on the roof as that is what makes this place special. You get to chose a table with jacuzzi in which you can put your feet, so suggest to wear lose trousers. It's a nice warm place with good service and good food. Do try their mushroom bruschetta, chilli paneer, chilli chicken, nachos, sizzling brownie with ice-cream. On weekends, there will be an hour long waiting so make sure to arrive atleast an hour earlier than your intended party time.

A nice little cozy place (not as spacious or big as it looks in the pictures in Zomato), service was excellent but try and avoid the American foods leaving the prawns served with breads, mocktails are good. Don't order draught beer, though the price is much less than any other places but it's not skimmed well resulting in a bad quality draught beer. Tandoor menu is the best they serve.😊

Visited the place yesterday. Good place with lovely foods. We tried cocktails, it was not best in the city but it's fare enough!! We tested kababs and some fish preparation with Cheez it's really mouth uttering .

Post that, I have few concern like I have reserved the seat beside Jacuzzi over phone but when I went there with friends they were unable to accommodate us there and advised to wait for 20 min. 
After waiting 30 min they accommodate us in rooftop but not beside jacuzzi and promised us to secured the place within 30 min.

However we left the place after one and half hours but they don't keep their promise. 
PS- We love the food but they should think about this. False promises can be impacted on thei rating.

Hope this clarifies the feeling!!!

A great rooftop lounge. Great ambience. They also have a jacuzzi in which someone can dip their legs while having the wonderful cocktails they serve. But as I've drunk my fare share of cocktails I know for a fact that these cocktails are not the best in town. We tried the classic margarita. A drink named the Bone Crusher which had a punch and a drink named Hurricane in white rum base. The tandoori tikka chicken awesome. Chilli chicken dry was great. And quantity of the food is too much to handle at that price range. If u want a relaxed night out with ur loved one then this is the place. Not a place for party animals. Just for those who wants great ambience and a great night out.

I went to this place today and the first thing that caught my attention was the ambience. Dimly lit yet comfortable enough to enjoy your food. We tried for the outdoor seating but the weather didn't permit us. Anyways we were seated inside and the very courteous staff helped us out with the food. We had ordered a fish finger and noodles wrapped chicken for the starter. I loved the fish which was fresh and beautifully fried. The noodles wrapped chicken served with a spicy sauce was a little on the heavier side. For main course we ordered grilled chicken in red wine sauce which was sumptuous and nice. We had also ordered a drought beer and a mojito. Though i don't drink beer my husband insisted me you take a sip and yes there was a lingering taste of burnt wood... Or I don't know how to describe the taste! The mojito was hands down the best I've had. All in all a good experience and would like to visit again.

I cannot get over with this place. So I visited last sunday and where do I begin, I am sooo awe struck. Completely in love with the food,ambience,service and crowd! 
So it was a sunday evening and we were aware of the heavy crowd and had a mindset to wait. Though didnt had to wait that long we were offered a seat at the bar counter but as we refused and wanted a proper table either in open air or inside we waited a little more and later we managed a table absolutely on the top terrace where they have the big screen.
We ordered a beer 330ml and a cocktail along with chicken 65 with a twist,which didnt taste something exceptional but was moderately good to taste.Now we wanted something heavy to eat,so ordered kitkat shake and dairy milk shake which tasted similar and a meat stuffed pizza which has a good portion to serve 3-4 people and is quite heavy with all the sausage stuffing in it.
Service was excellent as having such a long queue on a sunday evening none of the guests were rushed or hurried to vacant the seats rather waiters were courteous enough to look after from repeating drinks to helping you with your seats to suggesting the menu.Thums up for that.
Ambience was one if its kind,crowd is posh and healthy so you can enjoy without any worry. The view from the top is something to look for as the greenery of southern avenue make you feel you are sitting in some cafe on the top of a hill. Walking around inside whatsup gives a vibe of a big party going on where everyone is enjoying,smiling and grooving in their seats with all the lovely music and the amazing drinks.
One thing which i really liked is the management.Whatsup is not very spacious or huge rather its broken in parts and it would be really difficult to manage all the parts with such a crowd on a weekend and so they have bouncers all over to make sure guest are fine and constantly coordinating with each other with headphones and walky-talkies.
The bill came up to rs 2083 for two,GST did not make it bad i guess.
Next time I visit will try to get the jaccuzi.
Kudos whatsup!

The ambience and the drinks are good. But i feel they need to improve on the quality of the food served. I had ordered chicken club sandwich. It was very dry and the bread was roughly toasted. Hence it became very difficult for me to chew the bread. Next we had ordered french fries and mayonese. But it seemed like the mayo was not fresh.

I went to this place with my wife and couple of friends and we had a pitcher of beer along with Chicken Ceasar Salad, Chicken cooked in red wine sauce and chicken rice and the food was just awesome. We finished off with a couple of beers more and a hot choco cake.

The staff have had been real courteous. Looking forward to many more.

SO I went to this place with my in-laws. This was my first visit and I was extremely excited.

We started off with the Kabab Platter and I accept that I have not tasted a better Kabab preparation any of the outlets operating in the city ( barring the Peshawari outlet in ITC Sonar) .

Next up, we ordered

1. Chicken Involintini
Stuffed Chicken With rich red wine sauce. True to its description the taste of this dish remains even after I have gotten out. The well cooked chicken with the accompanied ingredients acts as a cherry on the CAKE.

2. Chicken Emmensea
wow...... Reminds me of my Thai affair... The coconut based gravy strikes the right chord. I don't like eggplants but that didn't stop me from eating it.

3. Grilled Chicken with Red Wine Sauce
This one is so soft and tender that it melted in my mouth. I might be exaggerating but I have not tasted a softer chicken before this...

Though I have not tasted all the items on the list, I wish to and I will definitely come back here. A 5 from my side... Special mention about the staff behaviour, service and courtesy.

This is a roof top cafe on the 6th and 7th floor of a building in Southern Avenue. Went there with a friend on a Saturday at around 4-5pm. We couldn't manage to get a seat in the open air and was just seated in the long chairs just adjacent to the doors opening to the open air. I ordered food and requested to shift us to the open air if by chance there is any vacancy by the time our food arrives.

Luckily there was a vacancy and we were shifted but just an opinion from my side, dont sit just below the staircase which goes to the 7th floor, as there is one glass pane open and you will be constantly in the fear that some dust falls in your plate when some one is walking above.

Go for any other tables in the open air. It has an amazing view of the south suburbs. The 180 degree view is soothing with lots of greeneries. Its advisable to wait to occupy a table in the outside even if that wait is for long and in the shabby staircase of the building where we found customers waiting while we were leaving.

The staffs are good and was keen to explain the items which were on offer on the menu.

We had the following...

Chicken Red Curry with Steamed Rice - I have had this Thai dish many times and I would say it was one of the best.
Chicken Involintini (Stuffed Chicken Breast served with Rice Red Wine Sauce)  - This was just awesome and a must try. They also serve mashed potato and vegetables along with this dish.

Food: 
Entree
1. Chicken Quesadilla - It tasted pretty good, however, it wasn't that special. 
2. Fish Lasooni Kebab - This was nice. But the side veggies we're not boiled enough.
Mocktails & Cocktails
We had ordered Virgin Pinacolada, Caprioska, and White Russian. And liked White Russian more than the others. 
Dessert
Sizzling brownie with ice cream and fake chocolate syrup. This is the WORST brownie I have ever had in my life. And believe me, I've had brownies from too many different places. Never in my life I've had such a brownie that such killed my mood. Chocolate syrup used is a very cheap one... Major bummer for a chocoholic like me. The chocolate stick was moist already when served with an oily smell. Sucks. 
Ambience:
Very very short space. Bad music collection. Too loud for such a small space. They wanted to probably merge a cafe with a bar but forgot that right kind of music plays a huge role. 
Service:
This is a USP for any eatery. And they flunked at it big time. Dessert was served before the entree and when they were asked the reason, they started giving stupid excuses.

All that glitters is not Gold. One of the worst cafes I have visited in Kolkata. To be honest the staff simply sucks. They don't know how to behave, how to talk in English and are complete turn offs. The place is very pathetically planned out so it always seems crowded but the fact is they have wasted a lot of space and the seating is less. The view is nice but the credit should go to nature for that not this cafe. What really pissed me off was that people arriving after me got seats and mind you they had not reserved from before, this happened just because of the inexperienced staff who had no idea about the people waiting. Please it is not even worth calling a lounge, we have series of much much better lounges in Kolkata who are similarly priced. 
I was so pissed of that me and my friends just walked off and didn't even feel like trying there food so I don't care its nice or not but definitely compared to the place it is way highly priced. I will never visit this place again and will stop all my known people too. 

DO NOT COME HERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY

There's a rooftop cafe on the sixth floor with a fabulous view of the Southern Avenue lake greens. You have your childhood best friends by your side, the alocohol lovers get to try some of the house special cocktails complimentary, there's a sudden drizzle and the sky becomes even more beautiful. Lovely music is being played live and there's a jacuzzi to relax as well. Tell me, what more can you ask for? 
The above paragraph was basically my What's Up Cafe experience in a nutshell. 
Last month, I had come here with my school friends to avail their Trippy Tuesday offer for a Ladies' Night. Being a teetotaler, I have had my portion of Virgin Pinacolada. My friends had tried - Adam and Eve, Sex on the Beach and Pinacolada. They said that the portion of alcohol in the cocktails were commendable and strong enough to get them high. I had my virgin version of Pinacolada. It was creamy and thick with the richness of coconut and refreshing pineapple. I liked my mocktail. 
Now comes the finger food, that we grabbed alongside the drinks.
Samak Makli - Pan seared fish in Lebanese Style. This tasted pretty good. Eight in one portion, the pieces were tender, fresh and succulent. Liked it. 
Polo Con Aioli - Basically this was grilled chicken served with coleslaw. The coleslaw was fresh and it is very important for a non salad person liked me. I literally hogged it down and needless to say, did the same with the chicken. 
Mushroom Crostini - I was surprised when a vegetarian dish turned out to be the best one of the night. Five in one portion, the breads of the crostinis were perfectly toasted and the topping tasted brilliant. This is definitely a must try at What's Up Cafe. 
My experience over here was fantastic. Being a bar, the place faces a lot of nuisance. The staffs handled the whole situation from tackling odd situations to allotment of places very efficiently, even during rush hours. This deserves special mention. 
Lastly, but not the least, What's Up Cafe bowls out all other places because of their ambience. The jacuzzi, the view, the indoor sitting area including the bar stand and most importantly the top floor withholding the spectacular view of the lake greens - visit this place for all these factors if not for their amazing food, drinks and hospitality. This place gets a thumbs up from me. You do come here, try out all their signatures and do let me know how it went. Happy Dining! :)

This place is really beautiful and well managed. I usually dont give reviews but once youbhave hae a bad experience wih some other place, it makes you appreciate the good ones. We went on a saturday and it was really packed . After waiting for sometime we got a seat inside which we were not satisfied with. On asking the manager, he assured us he would shift us outdoors as soon as it was empty. And although we had already placed our orders and food was served, they shifted us outside. I know it sounds normal, but we had gone to yet anothwr renowned rooftop restaurant where they refused to do this and made us place two orders.  So one could say this place is really well managed.
Coming to the food. The food was really good and the ambience made it even better. It is a bit costly but well worth it.

Really bad experience. We have visited there on a Saturday and after offering to beer the waiters announced that they were out of stock. Even when there was place available on the roof they said its already booked. Worst place to spend your evening. The food was not that good as well.

was there on a saturday night and the place was buzzing with life. good food and great drinks. was raining before we entered so couldn't get any rooftop table. after the rain stopped, had a smoke on the rooftop and it felt awesome. quality crowd and one of the restaurant guy helped me get a pack of cig from outside. had a great time there. definitely recommend.

One of the Cafes you got to visit before you die. Ambience was majestic, specially the view from the terrace. But you have to order hooqah for the terrace, as they said. We orderd a paan flavored hooqah, cocktails, chicken salami pizza and hot brownie with cream as dessert. The hooqah was well prepared. The pizza was good, thin crust (8 slices). 
It gets really crowded on weekends. The 180 degree view was breath-taking. Lotd of greeneries in that area which gives you a soothing experience. A must try. Warning - not light on the pockets!

I know it was not their fault as the cafe was full to the brim.I was lucky as I witnessed an event over there with some lady singer who was so sexy by her voice.the evening was all set.Bengali songs by a sexy voice,chicken cheese Maggie n shisha along with the drizzle outside.

Been to What's Up a couple of times. 
I have sat inside as well as outside. I particularly like the view from up. 
My friends and I enjoyed the jacuzzi on our first visit. 
The ambiance is excellent. But on the days they have live music, the case isn't such. The music keeps blaring from the music system and it becomes quiet unpleasant. 
The food here is so so nothing to rave about. I like the pizza. The cocktails are also ordinary. The beer bucket is something which will definitely attract your attention. 
The service here is good. The staff is prompt, cordial and always ready to accommodate you. 
You can come here with your friends to enjoy the ambiance they have to offer.

Was very excited to visit the place but all I could get was disappointment. As we visited on weekend so had to wait for 20 min before getting a seat but Its okay to wait that much if you want to visit a popular restaurant. They stopped one of my friend by saying that you don't look 21 year old. Even after providing them id card they were not satisfied. Had to convince them a lot to get us entered. On entering they had both the roof top and and dine in setting. We were fortunate enough to get outside seating. We had mainly gone there to have drinks. The waiter serving had no clue on how to serve a table. We ordered starter snacks with alcohol but he said "no sir! we will serve alcohol before snacks". After a lot of repeated requests he provided us with snacks when we had already finished half drinks. They were even not responding in one call. Had to literally rise from table to get their attention. But once our bill started to cross 10K then all of a sudden all focus was converged on us. All of a sudden they started providing us extra care. It is very unprofessional to do partiality with customers. 2.5 star for good food and ambience. Upgrade your staffs and behavioral standard.

From my last visit -
Crispy babycorn - 3/5
Formaggi pasta - 5/5 (the best)
Honkong noodles - 3/5 (because I am not a spicy food lover :'3)
Chocolate sizzler brownie - 5/5
Altogether, a superb ambience, great view, and @ with all cooperative staff.
The only problem is regarding the transport facility from that place particularly if you are 5 and no cab or taxi is ready to take one extra. :3

Kolkata is going ga ga over this place and why not? There is great ambience and brilliant service. Although I felt I'm sitting at a Bangalore pub, but it was extremely nice to be here. I wish the place was bigger on the outdoors because the rooftop side on both the floors is a little too small. It even started raining a while after we started and the staff moved us in, quickly.

Since we were there on a Sunday busy night, the tower was not available. I convinced them that I'm in town for just this weekend and boom, they got us the last tower. I was very happy with this .

The food is pretty good as well. The kebabs, fried chicken, french fries, nachos and everything. They play nice music and the view of south kolkata behind will surely make you happy. I enjoyed my dinner and I strongly recommend this place.

I have been to this place for 3 to 4 times and every time i found something or the other dissapointing. 
The service is not that bad they manage it pretty well on rush days like saturdays and sundays but when it comes to food they do not have a single dish that will soothe your taste bud. 
Located on the 6th floor of the building and on a terrace i genuinely found the look of the restaurant extremely pretty but food was way below average. It is absolutely on the go because of the availability of alcohol.
It is given 1000 for two on expense but it is a lot costlier than that . NOT AT ALL WORTH THE PRICE THEY TAKE.

I have come to know about this rooftop bar cum restaurent from facebook. 

But when i went there i got disappointment only. The photo on facebook on official page and the extact place is quite different. 

It was opposite on rabindra sarobar lake. 

We ordered blue lagoon , iced tea , old monk and chicken steak ! 

Blue lagoon was only mixed with water amd blue colour. I have found nothing good in it. 

Chicken steak was okay okay. 

Music was too loud. And the staffs were careless so much. They did not pay attention to us. 


Only the view from the place is nice. 
Thats all i have found good about what's up.

We tried stuffed calzone pizza which was gross and mixed sauce pasta which was just fine. Coming to the sisha, it was really good. We tried their special X in Dubai. I suggest they should improve on their food quality or else it's a great place to be at.

One of the best places if u want to spend a summer breezy evening but only if u get a table at the rooftop in open air as this place remains jam packed. Me n my friend were lucky as we got the famous pool table although we had to share it with a couple. Nevertheless, we ordered for stuffed chicken breast with red wine sauce, french fries, chicken popcorn with mustard sauce and cocktails - Hollywood Night and Caprioska. Food was delicious. Ambience was cool. But incase u prefer a quiet atmosphere this ain't the place! All in all a very well built place n highly recommended.

I simply couldn't stop swaying on my seat. The food is excellent. We gave continental a try and everything was bang on! Loved the Fish Florentine! The chocolate shake was surprisingly good. Simple but delicious! Service was good. Overall, a very nice experience. Thumbs up!

Situated at Southern Avenue this is a small wonderland which can please you with its amazing combination of people,  ambience, food and cool music. 

Firstly the surrounding is more like of an open air euro pub. The idea is well brought up, especially the fabulous concept of dipping your feet in a pool of water and enjoying some chilled beer and ofcourse the beauty of the greenery from the 6th floor added a sense of bliss to it. But that doesn't mean this place is a beer pub. It serves other drinks as well.

Secondly coming to the drinks and food as always the best  part... Well the we folks planned to enjoy a pitcher full of beer with some snacks. So off we were for a pitcher of beer. Complimented with some gala view of the ambience and real good music. We ordered for 2 more which was served on time. Also we went for some starters to have it with the beer. So we ordered for some crispy Chilli Chicken which was served hot and crust was real crispy and the dish medium spicy. 

Thirdly coming to the staff there is one word to describe them "Extremely Courteous" the food and the beer was served well in time. One of the few places where we were refused to tip the waiter inspite of the fact that the bill didn't have a service tax or a service charge added to it. Absolutely a homely experience that's what I can say.

Word to the management will be that the place is just awesome and can't be better. May you keep going this strong...

Great view and courteous staff. But sometimes a place's success leads to its downfall.
The place is located in the 6th floor of a mixed use(residential and commercial) apartment complex.
The elevator to the restaurant is very small , it can fit 3 - 4 people at most. The elevator may be branded what's up. But it is used by all residents in the building as it is the only elevator. This exasperates the problem by making a cramped elevator even more cramped.
The outdoor seating area is divided into two floors with upper floor offering the best views. The lower floor features a mini jacuzzi with tables.
The view mainly consists of rabindra sarovars tree canopies which surround the restaurant.
The food is so so. The moctails were tasteless and the chilli chicken we ordered was very spicy.
The main problem is with the places success it is attracting too many people .All of whom want to sit in the outdoor seating area. Hence it feels very crowded particularly at the evening. Also the music that blares out from the outdoor sound system can be a bit loud.
Overall an OK experience.

Wassupcafe 

Heard the buzz and went to check out wassup cafe. Locat d in Southern Avenue the place desperately needed something like this. The Interior's are regular but the main attraction is the open area which has 2 levels. Lower level has a jacuzzi where we sat with our legs in the water. A great experience I must say. On the upper level is the hookah area where u can have a go at one. The whole open area is covered with a faux grass carpet and gives the feel of relaxing meadows. The food n drinks are reasonable and good no surprises though. Also we were lucky to be there on a live band  night which created a magical evening.
The service is excellent under the leadership of there efficient manager Mr Shanti..
We had a lot of fun and looking back to go again.
Highly recommended..

The most disappointing is the way up to the place. You have a reception waiting up there in the narrow staircase with a bouncer and that when I realised it's like a pub or place for clubbing. 

Once we entered we were given a good seat with their tablet to go through the menu. Undoubtedly the menu is expansive and the food is good too. Step a bit more in and you enter the bar and then the open area where you at about 5-6 floors above open to sky. 

Can't say much about this place as I like it in the first place and then as time passes by, it got on to my nerve seeing the crowd and the activity all the time. It became a loud fish market with people undecided. This is the first place I fee where people come with no dressing sense and some very well dressed. 

There were people walking along the isle who didn't seem to have come to eat and chill.. it was strange to see the crowd this place attracts. 

Well the 2.5 point is only for the food.

My my! This is one of the best spot to calm yourself from the busy life of Kolkata. It's a 6 story open cafe, so you can imagine the kind of view you get from up there. They have range of hookahs each bringing a sudden different twist & change mood which you will enjoy. The music is awesome, the place looks sexy at night and you will love their service. In the end, you will have a great time up there.

The way of talking of waiter was absolutely undesirable and unpleasant. He was shouting whether we knew about a particular kind of dish. Even if he wanted to make a suggestion , there has to be some etiquette

No matter how far you stay; this place demands a visit. I am giving 5 stars for Decoration, Interior, and Location.
They have indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangements. Indoor area is beautifully decorated and I bet you have never been to somewhere like this before.
Now.. the most famous part of What's Up Cafe is the rooftop area. I can not express how strikingly they have planned and implemented everything. Kudos to the people whoever has designed and decorated the place.
While entering you will notice a Jacuzzi, where they allow their customers to sit! A sultry, summery evening in the jacuzzi with a drink accompanied by your favorite people. Imagine how cool is that.
I was already impressed with cafe itself; a picturesque​ view of south Kolkata just added more excitement to that.
We witnessed one of the most glorious sunset from the cafe. If you are late to catch the sunset don't be upset because they have rocking playback list too, which is a perfect stress buster.
Moving to the food, we had ordered Blue lagoon, Iced tea, Kit Kat shake from the mocktail segment and one Cafe latte from beverages​. After that we had Chicken
roulade, Fish kung pao and Chicken hakka noodles. Don't have a single complain about the food, though the quantity could be a little more.
Staffs were well behaved and service was okay.
Hope you all enjoy the fullest and share your experience too.

Had heard about this place from a friend, so thought of trying it out! completely wasteful, except the rain and jacuzzi and Sanam Puri songs, nothing really was so good about the evening.. Bloody Virgin Mary was like tomato soup without vodka and Screwdriver was like orange juice without pulp and vodka!

Visited this cafe on Sunday during the India Pakistan match for a beer and some grub. The location is easy to find as it's located on the main road right next to crave restaurant. 

It's situated on the 6th floor and the outdoor seating is not an issue as a slow breeze blows almost at all times. Coming to food and drinks, we ordered for beers which were basic so no complains there, in snacks we ordered 

Salt and pepper chicken - this tasted just like the salt and pepper American corn but better cause chicken was involved 

Cajun spiced chicken - this dish didn't appeal to my palette as much as the other dishes did, so no go from my side

Roasted chicken nachos - the toppings were too less for my choice so I didn't particularly enjoy it too much. If the toppings were better, it would have been much better. 

The place isn't exactly cheap but not too expensive either, it's a good deal for the ambience. 

For photos of food I eat, follow me on Facebook and Instagram! (Same name in both places)

This place was in my bookmarks for a long time. Finally got a chance to visit this place. 
This is a nice place bustling with a different range of people (age). I liked this place very much. They have a  Jacuzzi. This place is always full and very hard to get a seat. The decoration is very quirky. The ambience was good with good music. The food was nice. Nothing extraordinary tastewise. But the presentation of the food was very innovative. Staffs were friendly and helpful. Will definately visit this place again.

Read about the place a lot and heard about it too..But sadly failed to impress me. Their USP the rooftop and a surrounding view. Sadly it seems that the staff only allows the regulars outside and a new face is rejected by saying that the rooftop is full. When I ordered a lime cordial to go with my vodka they served me freshly squeezed lemon along with the seeds saying that it was better than lime cordial. And the most hillarious part of the evening was when they served the starter after the main course sighting that the ingredients had finished. Did not know that so many people were happy with such trashy service.

I'm putting up this review quite late.
The place is obviously a delight in terms of its decor and the way it's been put together. 
The food is tad decent and nothing great to be honest. 
What makes this joint stand out is the fact that it has this brilliant outdoor seating space. That's definitely the USP.
The service really needs to improve as the staff at times is a bit arrogant and lacks courtesy.
Definitely a visit for the sheer ambience it provides.

Highly hyped rooftop cafe. Loses its charm though while sitting indoors, as during this summer time. Didn't get a chance for the Jacuzzi seater, seems like few priority customers get that chance ignoring others who might be waiting from before.
Ordered-
Oreo shake and cafe frappe- These were the only 2 decent options left as the waiter informed there was no cheese for strawberry cheese shake and no kiwi for banana kiwi shake. Nevertheless, both tasted as expected.
Twice cooked mushroom topped with feta cheese- It was a good combination of fried noodles and mushroom. The cheese mentioned in the menu actually turned out to be one tiny dollop on the top of mushroom, if not seen with focus could totally escape ur attention. 
Seasonal mango panna cotta- It tasted divine. The only good thing about visiting this place. #recommended
Service and food should  be improved.

Though I have visited this place many a time, but first time we got a chance to sit at rooftop. It is just same other any other roof top in any other cities, but the add-on is the jacuzzi! But you must have a great luck to enjoy that. We had nachos and french fries since the plan was like that only. The only thing I am not satisfied is that they don't serve towers. 
Moral of the story : The place is recomanded to hang out with friends!!

Whats Up was in my visit list as I have heard a lot about the ambiance of this place from my friends. The place is situated on Southern Avenue, right opposite to lake. The place is on 6th floor. It was a Sunday hence the crowd I saw there was expected. However the lift was very small and you will always see people waiting outside the lift. They have 3 parts in this place. The first one after entering is the indoor part then you move to 1st level open rooftop and above that there is another open rooftop on the upper level. I would always recommend to sit on either of the rooftop segments if you are going around the afternoon.

In the menu they had a huge list of draught beer but when asked they mentioned only one brand is available as draught. We ordered couple of pitchers and tandoori chicken with them. Service was not very fast but beer was served chilled. Tandoori chicken was nice and good in quantity. I must say the tandoori was more spicy that the ones I have everywhere. The ambience of this place is great as you get a nice view of the city and the greenery around. I felt that they should train their staffs a bit about professionalism. As this is not a very cheap price pub, customers will expect more professionalism while serving foor or cleaning up the table.

Hey Guyz🙋🏻
Today we went to this really beautiful place called "What'sup Cafe" located in Southern Avenue, Kolkata just opposite to nazrul mancha with my group of friends and without a doubt we had an amazing time there.😀 We went there for lunch and had 4 different kinds of food.
Firstly, to talk about this place it has a really beautiful and soothing ambience with some good music playing in the background❤️. It's situated on the 7th floor of the building which obviously provides you with a perfect view😍. They have both indoor as well as outdoor siting arrangements. Also, you have seperate bar, hookah and smoking area. They have a wide variety of items in their menu to choose from. 
Plus you get a really courteous and helpful staff to help you out and the service was really good which is also a big yay!😀. 
Coming onto the food-
We had Blue Lagoon, Stuffed Chicken Pizza with ham crust, oregano crushed chicken tikka kebab and sizzling brownie served with ice-cream & chocolate sauce.😍 
Overall, we had a great experience dining in at Whatsup Cafe. And would surely recommend you guys to visit this place with your family & friends👍🏻😀.

Came here yesterday with another lady friend to enjoy the perks of trippy Tuesday ladies special at What's up.The ambience was brilliant and I loved the music being played here.We stayed there for long we enjoyed a bit of the live music too.It started pretty late though.

We tried these cocktails

Mojito
Cosmopolitan
Pinacolada
Sex on the beach
Adam and Eve

All of these were very well made.Amount of alcohol in the cocktails were pretty good without hampering it's pleasantness on the palate.

Alongside we ordered a fish finger.Fish was fresh,flaky,soft inside with a crispy golden brown coating.It was served with French fries and tartare dip.
We also had a pint of beer each.

I would've given it a higher rating but there were few glitches.Service should be markedly improved.It was very slow.For smoking one has to walk up to corners to the bins for dumping ashes and cigarette butts.The corners were getting congested often.It would've been easier if ashtrays were kept in each table in the outside sitting area.

We had a great time otherwise.

A much awaited and long pending visit. The planning was on from Jan and was successful yesterday. After a long time visited a very cool yet affordable cafe cum hangout zone in Kolkata. The cafe is decorated in the most simple yet chic fashion. Both indoors and outdoors seating options are available. We got to seat indoors as the outdoors section was all full. The big glass windows give you a full view, which makes the cafe look a lot more spacious than what actually it is.
Coming to food, since it was a visit for very short time, got to try only a few items, but all of them was a major hit for me.
Starting with roasted chicken Nachos- the roasted bits of chicken was very well prepared and 4 different sauces added extra flavor to the dish. Tried 2 mocktails - Kiwi Delight and Virgin Pinacolada and Kiwi Delight tasted simply awesome.
In dessert i had my favorite that is Panacota which was tasted ok to me as it was a little hard compared to what Panacota should be, but the taste was definitely good, it was topped with seasonal sauce - Mango extract for this season.
I would love to visit again and try more options.

Located in the area of the city I love the most. On top of that it's on the top. 
Ambience - you can't go wrong if it's in southern avenue on the 6th floor with amazing lighting and music. Loved it.
Food - Went there for drinks so didn't have much to eat. We did have rosemary's garlic bread and babycorn. Decent.
The problem was with variety. They just had Heineken beer and only one brand of vodka. Maybe we caught them on a bad day and most drinks are usually available. Anyway, lovely place. Highly recommended.

Me and my friends had this place as a priority in our  MUST VISIT list, but somehow the plans usually failed. It was only on 29th April that our plan was actually executed.

Wooo!!  What an ambience... truly in love with it!
 The surrounding, the decor, the arrangement everything was awesome. But, when it comes to food, it was actually a little disappointing. We had ordered chilli babycorn, chicken hakka noodles, and mocktails. Taste was okay, standard but not so good!

Well it is located in southern avenue, opposite nazrul manch, 7th floor....so can be easily located....a place where college students usually hangout, so for young generation like us, a place like this is a bliss.

We were lucky enough to get a seat outside in the jacuzzi area,and the weather too was breezy so all in all a beautiful evening with my friends..

The staff was also very humble.

So to conclude, I would say that though its a bit on the Expensive side..
 But given the ambience, the feel and the freshness you actually get at this place, price doesnt matter that much.

Be sure to leave the place with a smile on your face :)


PROS: Ambience, seating arrangement, music, location.
Cons: shabby entrance, limit of 3 person in the lift, food is little expensive.

That's all folks! :)

Been to this place 2 days back. Ambience is sober and soothing along with well behaved staff and generous amount of food and drinks. Only drawback is the elevator system, as the cafe is situated on the top floor you have go with the help of an elevator which can only accomodate 3 along with the liftman.

Recently visited this place with a few friends late at night. It's located opposite to the KaliBari lakes, just ahead of the Southern Avenue outlet of Dugout. The cafe is on the 6th floor and the lift is small, fitting only 3-4 average sized people. The place is popular and there is often a waiting line. Food wise the food portions and taste are good but the prices are slightly higher compared to other options, but their prices have a convenience premium attached to them because they offer Liquor and Hookah along with food all under one roof. The ambiance is fancy, specially the seating space outdoor and glass chamber on top of it. All in all, this place is a must visit if ambiance and the feel of the cafe is what matters more to you and not the food. They could work on the prices though.

I have been to this place twice but didn't get the chance to sit in the rooftop area :(. But the food made up for that. We ordered 2-3 dishes and the best among them was the chicken lasagne. They should take care of the volume of the music that they play.. It's too loud. Other than that it was a nice experience.

What's up wowed me up with its majestic ambience. Such a cool place to hang out. Located just opposite to Nazrul Mancha on the 7th floor.. They both have indoor and outdoor (roof top) seating arrangement. The huge glass panes gave a extravagent spectacular view of the city. The open rooftop was crowded up so we settled down in the indoor space. 
Even the menu card surprised me. It was not the normal paper card. It was E-menu. 
So for the foods ordered 
*ROASTED CHICKEN & PANINI SANDWICH- The sandwich was served with french fries and tomato sauce. The bread was a toasted one. Loved it. 2 layer of toasted biscuit like bread filled with roasted chicken, tomatoes and sauces. Loved it. Enough for 2.
*HAWAIIAN PIZZA- 6 pieces of thin crust pizza filled with chicken, ham, caramalised onion, pineapple, capsicum and green chilli. The v.first bite gave a chessy burst into my mouth. The pineapple popped in your mouth alongwith the chicken and ham. The green chilli added that extra flavour. Must have for pizza lovers. The quantity was again enough for 2 of us.
The price was little on the higher side. Total 699 bucks.
So basically if you are in a mood for good food with good friends to chill up with a beer alongwith some crackling music then definitely its a must visit. Will be visiting again and next time definitely on the rooftop 😊

Awesome. Once you look out and discover you are on top, that's the feeling.  Go towards dusk/evening, and see the sun setting in and the city lights coming to life, while you sip your favorite drink.

Wish the place were more spacious.

In Calcutta i always used to crave for a place with identity,  not another run of the mill eatery.  This is one of the really unique places south Calcutta. Besides being a bar,  sheesha and lounge,  the eatery it beholds overlooking the rabindra sarobar area is spectacular. If nothing ypu should visit the outlet for the view!!. The service itself is good,  however the food is average. But its the experience for which i am giving my rating to whats up

The view is very nice and the unique decor! Rates are medium for two with alcohol. Only problem about the bar is they don't keep other beer except Tuborg & Kingfisher, Obviously drinkers would like to try something else than that! The services are not good enough! Take 30 minutes to deliver the food. You probably will not get any deserts which is written on the menu except only one blueberry cheese cake where it's not really a cheese cake.

Ambiance - phenomenal!
Food - good.

I went there with my fiancé and friends. We were a group of 6. My fiancé and I reached early so we sat there having hookah. The servers are very friendly and courteous. I had made a reservation for the Jacuzzi so we got it when everyone reached. It was one of a kind experience to eat and drink sitting in a jacuzzi in a breezy evening and having a gala time with friends.

Coming to drinks and food, we ordered Bailey's Irish Cream, red wine, beer, fresh lime soda, crispy chilli baby corn, veg hakka noodles and veg manchurian. All were pretty decent. A little pricey.

This is a great place to chill with friends or a loved one and chat over a couple of drinks or hookah. A very happening and one of a kind cafe to be in!

P.S. They accept reservations only 24 hours ahead of your visit so if you're going in a big group, make sure to reserve tables. It's a very busy café. There was a queue by the time we were leaving.

@Udita and Me went there for a fun hangout . But then it turned into something different . As we waited for a table ,a guy came and asked us do u have id proof ? We said no. He replied, if you don't have id proof,I can't allow you into the bar. I curtly said we don't want to drink . He looked at us ,taken aback . and then checked us head to toe. We both were wearing jeans and top .NOT A SHORT DRESS LIKE MOST GIRLS IN THAT CAFE. We waited and then casually strolled into the rooftop area ,this guy waved us out ,declaring "This is a service area Mam. " I was surprised, many peopel went in there ,he didn't shove them inside like he did to us . We felt humiliated. Finally when we got a seat ,we ordered . Chicked Bruschetta & Chicken Club Sandwich . The waiters too were quite indifferent . There was only one senior waiter who talked to us kindly . I understand the cafe is mostly a bar . But that does not mean ,I am compelled to drink right ? SO IF GIRLS REFUSE TO DRINK. YOU JUST IGNORE THEM LIKE AN INFECTION. ..WOW !!!! KEEP IT UP .

Its been a long wait since I was eagerly waiting to visit after I came to know about this place and saw the roof top images. Its a lovely concept with cool interiors and a South Kolkata and Rabindra Sarovar Lake skyline. I visited during the evening and found the place choc a bloc with young crowd hopping in. After a quick scroll through their e-menu I opted for Chicken Roulade-it was quite high on garlic and herbs but tasty. The Pan Friend Chilli Fish was nice and tangy with good portion size. Fish n Chips-was more like Fish Orly/Batter Fry and not the typical fried fish we crave for, it was a bit sour in taste may be due to its seasoning. I had to ask for drinking water and then again for a glass, I think this was uncalled for. Overall a good yet clumsy place. The minus point is being clumsy it has no emergency exit, only way in and out is through a narrow elevator and a narrow staircase to the 6th floor and the kitchen is right in front of the exit door which is alarming. I am sure the authorities would take a note of this. Would love to come back soon :-)

My first visit to any open-terrace restaurant. I just loved this place. Decor is mind-blowing. There is seperate areas for family-get together and friends-get togethers. They have live band, hookah bar also. Ordered a bucket of Budweiser, two nonveg platters, and two pizzas. Foods tasted good. Stuffs are really very careful about their services​. A bit costly but the place is so amazing that everyone will love it.

Absolutely disgraceful behaviour

The place is a little bit small and somitimes if its full you could have to wait for hours in the staircase standing rubbing your face with your hanky coz its not centralized ac.
Once your enter the cafe your perspective changes and slowly if you spend time ypu would be in love with the ambience.

Going to this place was a very sudden decision and 1 that I wouldn't regret. It's got a beautiful rooftop arrangement and the view from the top is amazing.Great choice of music.
Service and quality of food is good.
One huge disappointment was the coffee whereas the place is known to be a cafe as well.They should definitely improve the quality and the presentation.
But nonetheless will make it a point to visit again!

The only disappointment was the seating arrangement ... The manager promised to give us a better seat but later changed his mind and gave the place to others very smartly ... Even other staffs were clueless about what to do ... So, service was not upto the mark at all ...

On a friday evening if you ask a person that what would they like to do after office & if they are in the mood for party & chilling out then whats up is the place to be for your ideal chillaxing time. Located about 5mins from golpark more towards southern avenue opposite of lake tucked in the 6th floor of the building. They have both indoor(A.C) & outdoor sitting(rooftop). Unfortunately we couldn't get an outdoor sit since it was full, so we took the indoor place. The decoration seemingly caught our eyes with age old light plug points & funky steers. The place was really buzzing with great music & live match screening.

After settling ourselves, we ordered the following:-

1. 1 draught beer pitcher - Unfortunately we wanted to have 4+1 heineken/miller but those were unavailable so we settled for this. A large mug of chilled draught beer was served which was equal to about 5.5 small mugs(330ml)

2. 2 beer mugs

3. Roasted chicken nachos - Crisp nachos was served with roasted chicken,bell peppers & spicy masala. The dips were warm cheese,cream,tomato salsa & rajma salsa. The roasted chicken were super tasty although the it would have been better to sprinkle all over the nachos instead of just using it as the bed for nachos. The dips were okayish but the cheese stood out, liked the stickiness of it.

4. Meat lovers pizza - Thin crusted pizza with 8 slices which had full of flavours. The combination of chicken ham salami along broccoli was a new one but complimented quite well with each other. The dough was crisp & tasted superb.

5. Crispy chilli babycorn - Super crispy babycorn sauteed in onions,chillies & capsicums. The quantity was good for the price & the spice factor was spot on. The ideal started with your beer.

Overall the service stood out in my opinion. Always busy yet very attentive. The food was served super fast from the time of order. The price for 3 of us came to 2220. They charge separate vat & service tax but no liquor tax/service charge which makes the pocket pinch a tad lighter. We were totally satisfied.

What's up! Foodies.. I am sure I will be short of words in this review.

This cafe is located just opposite to Nazrul Mancha. The entry of this place is off a bit. The escalator can only have 2 people at a time but in the night when we were leaving around 12 am, it was not working. I planned this cafe visit months back because I was waiting for my better half to land in Kolkata. Finally last week was that beautiful evening. The place made us groovy.We were unable to have a seat on rooftop but we managed that by taking our drinks from indoor to rooftop. The breeze hit us hard and it was a full moon night. Each and every details of that day was perfect & it turned out majestic with a live performance & precense of Tollywood actor Parambrata. 

Now coming to the interior , food & service. The cafe was well designed, the bar counter & the rooftop get a huge thumbsup. Would strongly recommend to have a visit and experience it by yourself. We ordered Tuborg,Burdwiser, 3 cocktails along with chicken 65 & chilli baby corn. The service starting from table reservation to our goodbye bade was appreciatable. 

The night was perfect in every sense, I would strongly recommend to visit this cafe at sunset time & an urge to the owner to make a dance space.

Went there few days back... when we arrived there we request them for outdoor seat but they told we have to wait fr sometime so we waited fr long time last of all they refused to give seat outside.. mainly it is famous for its open rooftop cafe.. Mainly we visited there fr its openrooftop cafe but we were embraced by their behaviours.. some of the waiters behaviour is so bad cant even express.. if we visit next time should book table in rooftop if they ensure they will give table then we should visit nexttime.. otherwise not at all interested to visit..

A rooftop cafe located just opposite to the nazrul manch.
Been there's few days back for a friend's farewell party, so one last amazing hangout was mandatory. 
The place suits our mood and it was Sunday and we were thing if we will be able to grab a seat or not. 
Well we did, Yay!

And the view was a bonus. 

We ordered for 
beer (tuborg green) 
Crispy chilli baby corn 
Chicken Caesar salad
Margarite pizza
Milkshake with ice cream 

There waters were helpful and the service was first.
Would definitely recommend to those bunch of baboons who wanna hangout and make some noise.

This place is very relaxing & u get a beautiful view from the top. This open air restaurant has a very soothing environment which gives u a Goa-Goa feel, no seriously. The wind is a plus point here.
Though the space is bit narrow & small but still it manages to attract a lot of crowd.
The entrance is a bit confusing, only 3 people in lift along with a lift-man are allowed and after getting down from the lift, u need to walk up another floor where the entrance is really very much narrow.
About the ambiance: Well, its a beautiful view especially at the night time with the cold, soothing wind.
Food: It is good not best but... Yeah, good.
Service: Well maybe for some reason our order was being delayed every time. We orderd a kebab platter & stuffed chicken pizza & a beer tower, & all these 3 orders came a bit late otherwise its a must go place.
The music is good, the place is good, the food is good & most importantly the view is really very good.

Located just opposite to nazrul manch,its on the top floor of six storeyed building. The decor was innovative and inviting. We went there around 1pm and wanted to try the jacuzzi seat, but the staff told it wont be available before 3.30. Tried polo con aioli, grilled fish with parsley lemon sauce and margarita pizza. The 1st two tasted good. But the pizza was horrible. 
The view of the city from the open air is awesome. 
Staffs are good and friendly.
Overall nice experience.

This place is just the perfect weekend fun spot. The décor n services simply succeeded my expectations. The best thing about this place is the Amazing open air rooftop with spectacular view o the city. Loud music n fun crowd, something you can never afford to miss. Now let's talk about the food. We had ordered white pasta n grilled chicken in red wine sauce. The good quality food left me jaw dropped. We were literally full still didn't wanna waste any o the mouth watering dishes. Do visit in a group to have added fun!

The food was horrible. I don't know what was wrong with the chef coz he didn't manage to prepare one good dish that evening!! Not a single thing that was ordered was palatable. I hate to do this but I think it's important that I highlight the fact that if someone's going to this place for the food, then he/she is bound to get big time disappointed. But what the good part about this place is, is the behaviour of the waiters and the manager and also their service. It's a pity that they have such a bad chef! Apart from this, the place has an electric atmosphere specially in the evening!! Ideal place for the young crowd to hang out!  The location, the set up and the service - everything deserves a thumbs up except for the taste of the food!!!!! Oh yes. The cocktails were prepared equally horrible.

The place-- amazing decor. The jacuzzi is a killer. The view is also breathtaking. Preferred the outdoor seating.
Food-- Had ordered the staple French Fries, Chicken Roulade and Chicken Risotto. The food was nice but the risotto was mushy mushy whereas I prefer the Al Dente type. Had also ordered a strawberry mojito which was really nice.

Overall nice experience which I would love to relive again for sure

Listing from appetizers to deserts , this place makes some good dishes though i'm a bigger fan of it's shakes and deserts than it's continental offerings. Give the Sizzling Brownie served with Hot Chocolate and Ice Cream a try if you ever come here.

Review highlights-Ambience: The outdoor sitting is cool but space is very limited.The chairs/tool should be more comfortable for relaxation.Food: Satisfactory.Service:Good .The behaviour of each service people was very friendly and well mannered.Suggestion: 1)There should be some selective genre / theme for music playing in background for a particular day of week. (e.g. Blues/Jazz / Rock n roll / RNB )2) Booking procedure should be more systematic.(through Zomato or direct booking).Overall experience is good.Wish to  visit again for the top floor of rooftop or the amazing foot water bath to capture some more picture.Thanks!

Good things first, the guys are nice. The ambiance is good, particularly the terrace. Initially they told it is full - which was untrue, probably they wait for larger groups to come. The food is decent, we ordered Chelo Kabab . Don't order bruschetta pomodoro, it's not worth. Drinks are good.

Probably one of the best roof top restaurant in the city..The food is somewhat satisfying not upto the mark..amd even the food and drinks is damn costly.But only thing that drags me to them is there ambience..I hve visited this restaurant 3times and its a pure bliss to seat under the sky with a beer in your hand..So its a must go if u want to spend a extra pinch to get a worldclass ambience

Targeted and filled with teenagers and those in early 20s. Not really a premium place. Inside furniture,  cutlery etc doesn't give premium feel. Service people are friendly. They didn't have any domestic premium beers.  Only tuborg,  kingfisher,  and Crona.  The only plus point is outdoor seating  and but you can use that only when weather is on your side. I hope they will make outdoor seating more weather friendly.

So, my boyfriend brought me here to celebrate v day ✌
We had a table booked for us at the rooftop and arrived at around 5:30.  I was quite amazed as the well decorated cafe was situated on the 8th floor of a building opposite of nazrul manch and had a really good city view . Its best to go there in the evening, one can enjoy the afternoon breeze and sunset generously over there.
Ambience 5/5
Food came with cool garnish. ( Though not the drinks). But the taste was poor. Among food we ordered dry chili chicken, club sandwich and hot chocolate. The hot chocolate needs some serious improvement as it tasted like bournvita! 
Food 3/5
Service was quick and they were friendly ( a bit too friendly though according to me) . 4/5
Pocket pinch is a bit high. And i felt it is majorly due to ambience, since the good was nothing great . 
But the place is really one of a kind and worths a visit ! 👍

Well, food and booze were great but I expected something more sophisticated from their service persons. At a point of time the waiter was kind of arrogant and didn't feel like take the order in a polite way. This was our second time here and the guy serving us was behaving like he had a rough time with his close ones which affected his work etiquette. We were ordering foods but his gesture compelled us to call the manager. He was more towards teaching us how to behave ourselves but we already mentioned that we already did our apology part. We had to checkout earlier. Never coming to this place again.

As a restaurant owner they should know how to cooperate with customers rather than only feeling proud about their branding in the city of joy Calcutta.

Even a huge rain fall could stop us nor the innkeepers to server us . Loud music , beer , friends , beautiful view and rain .... Blessed from above. Thanks what's up.

Being a South Kolkata resident, it is very convenient to reach. The ambience is good, but the space is cramped, which at times feels cozy, but with an influx of people the environment gets very noisy and annoying. The food is great, and service is prompt. I will recommend a visit during the afternoon hours, when their will be less rush and you can enjoy the view of the South Kolkata skyline with a pint of beer.

Pros:
1. Good Ambiance.
2. Got good food option.
3. Service was also good with staff really patient and nice to everybody and quick service of orders.
4. No guest parking but being in good location you can easily find one nearby. 
5. Good Music played with separate music for open space and separate for enclosed one. 

Cons:
1. Not all beers listed in the menu is available.
2. If you order beer bucket, there actually isn't any bucket given. But the staff was courteous to change it when its time for you to move to next bottle. The beers were not chill though. 
3. Being a small place, getting a seat outside can be challenging specially during weekend.

Overall I would say its a good place to hand out as the crowd was also decent. 

Happy Experiencing Life !!!

Very nice ambience , to die for view of the entire Southern Avenue. Service was top notch and warm. Only thing that took half a point away was the availability of preferred mocktails and cocktails. Otherwise , there's nothing that can take away the glam that the place adds to meaningful conversation with special people and the good times that you have with them. Good luck , gonna visit soon enough.

A nice place to hang out with friends or colleagues. Has got decent range of hookahs and foods. The best place to sit is the tub/pool. If you are lucky enough you might get a chance to sit there otherwise you have to take some other sit. But I would suggest to have the open space seats because they are much more enjoyable. And of you want the tub/pool then I think you need to book them earlier. The only downside according to me is the music. It's a bit loud for me. But if you enjoy loud music with good food then surely you should visit this place.

And, I'd like to go back again, if not for anything else, but for their excellent service.

Located in southern avenue,just opposite of Nazrul Mancha,this place has already become the talk of the town!
This was my third visit here. For a group of 3 individuals we ordered
1.Cheese fondue with chicken popcorn- beautifully spiced cheese fondue with 8 pieces of crispy chicken popcorn
2.Polocon ( Chicken) aioli- tender chicken pieces well spiced served with aioli(dip),salad and a savoury biscuit.
3.Minced chicken lasagna- This one fills your stomach completely.
4.Meat lover's pizza- it had salami and veggies,however could have given more chicken pieces instead of broccoli and capsicum.
5.Two mocktails,virgin Mojito(kiwi) was very refreshing which had mint and tulsi leaves in it and Pina colada which was pretty mediocre.

Rooftop ambience is amazing mainly because of the topfloor location and overlooking Nazrul mancha which boasts of its greenery, however the interior is dimly lit and the seating arrangement is pretty cozy inside. Staff is very well behaved.

There are only two negative aspect here, firstly is its entrance which can be easily missed as there are several other eateries located in the ground floor
And secondly the price is slightly on the higher side for food and extremely high for hard drinks.

We came down here on a Friday evening. We were told that the rooftop was off limits that evening. This was disappointment number one. We settled for the indoor seating which was decent. 
Next, credit has to be given where its due. The service staff is very friendly and helpful. The music that they play hits the right notes, which is very important to someone like me. 
Coming to the food, we had roasted chicken nachos and chicken roulade. The dips were average. Nachos were nothing special. Roulade was good-ish. One thing which what's up can think of is a happy hours window. There prices are competitive with those of other pubs across the town, but most of them have happy hours for all or some specific days.
Looking forward to visiting the place again, this tine probably on the rooftop.

This place is quite easy to locate..just opposite of najrul mancha. On 6th floor of the building. Amazing view, this place has a Jacuzzi too where you can just drop your legs and chill with your friends or beloved ones. The ambience is great i can say but they need to improve their food menu the number of verity is less...same goes for drinks..
Well that day we ordered two non veg salads that tested average and too much leafy..i mean too much 😖
and we ordered a kiwi mojito that also tested average..and beers, as they were only serving kingfisher on that day...along with that average food experience their service was also very poor...they took almost 20mins to serve salads.
Bt it is worthy for the ambience to visit the place over again 👍

This place has a huge advantage due to its ambience. There's something particularly satisfying about sipping a drink on top of a high rise with the Kolkata skyline surrounding you. 
The food,however,dissapointed me. The chicken salt and pepper was chewy and hard. The oregano sprinkled tikka kabab was marginally better but not mind-blowing. The food options were quite limited.
The cocktails could be stronger,and the drinks are quite pricey when compared to the service.
We had 12 small pegs of Black dog,2 cocktails and 2 starters,and the bill was around 5000 bucks. Not a place to get properly sloshed,I guess.

No doubt. It is a good place to hang out.  
Well we was really unfortunate that we have to seat inside the room of the restaurant when there is a beautiful roof is available it was because of highly demand of those table.  
It was first experience for me that,  people are standing outside of the restaurant as queue.. just to wait for their chance to enter.  So I just you to go early  after evening you might find hard to get a entry. 
All together it was a good experience.

Food quality is good with variety in booze.  Staffs are well behaved and efficient . You will fall in love with this place once you visit. Would highly recommend  for a casual friend gathering! Price is fairly reasonable.

With a lot of memories, this place has to offer one of the best times you can have. 
Viewing the very few skylines in the city with your legs down in the jaccuzzi, and some good music can sort your evening only if you are there with your closest friends. 
Try the variety of sandwiches they offer in wooden plates, which are finger licking good. 
They are very strict in serving alcohol to someone under 21. 
The rooftop is nice as you dont have to smell the second hand sheesha smoke. You can have your own too if you are 18.

Honestly, this place deserves no star. You cannot get good ratings owing to just the location, unless you're on top of the world which this restaurant isn't. 
I've visited this place twice and for both the times, I've had the "luck" to get the Jacuzzi. The last time that I had visited, I had particularly tried my best to book a rooftop table for my friend and I. But of course, it was turned down by the owner as well as the staff there, which seemed weird because when someone books a table, it is usually ALWAYS offered if it's not pre-booked otherwise. In my case, the rooftop table wasn't and it was still not offered owing to the fact that we were 2 people. We went to the rooftop area only to find empty tables. To our surprise, we noticed the owner tell the staff to put "Reserved" tags there, forcefully. 
Way to lose customers, guys! 

While I was infuriated and was ready to leave, my friend had seen my zeal to make this date special. He insisted on staying and therefore, we settled with the jacuzzi which my friend loved (that was the target, so, no complaints.) Coming to the real points now- the food.

1st visit was in January, when I had ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Hot Coffee. Both were decent.

2nd visit irked me and made me confident on never returning to this phony place. We had ordered one plate of Chicken Popcorn with Mustard Mayonnaise which served hardly 11-12 tiniest bits of chicken cubes. The meat was hardly present, mostly it was the fried batter. That too for Rs.275. I'd have had way too tastier chicken popcorn at a KFC and a better price and more quantity that this place. The food was a royal disaster.
Then, we took one Chocolate Shake and my friend took Pina Colada. Both were decent because they were liquids. 

STAFF: This is perhaps the biggest negative point of the place. Rude waiters who denied everything, from seats to certain food items that you wanted to eat. Enough to switch off the excitement, more when you see that the owner of the place is as arrogant as the waiters. Plus, they take at least 20 minutes to deliver your food/drinks.

MUSIC: WAAAAAYYYYY too loud. Cannot enjoy a lonesome conversation.

PAYMENT ISSUES: Happened only the first time when I visited in January that none of their credit card machines were working. Absolutely none!

In one line, NO THIRD TIME VISIT. :)

We ordered for a chicken lasagna. Which a cheesy chickeny delight. Very filling. Came looking absolutely devour-able on a wooden platter. The quantity was sufficient for two. We ordered for a Mexican boat pizza, which was good but did not have a thin crust. 
The prices are slightly on the higher range but the food is definitely worth it.
The highlight is definitely the cityscape visible from the place. Absolutely beautiful!
Will go back for the sizzling brownies :D

I visit Kolkata once or twice a year and generally amused by the laid back nostalgia that has stood the test of time. However, to my pleasant surprise, Kolkata now has a  number of amazing roof top restaurants with vibrant music. What's up will definitely rank quite high on that list. It has a nice seating arrangement on the inside where you can converse over food with your loved ones. If you step out, it's a whole different world all together with clear skyline and rabindro sarobar lake lurking in the dark.
Fish Lasuni Kebab was so soft that it literally melted in mouth and chicken tandoori was also nicely done. This is definitely a Gen X place which appears a tad bit expensive but the ambience and crowd compensates for it 😁

I ordered grilled chiken wid red wine sauce nd chef's special lebanese spaghetti and 1 bloody mary (for which we had to show our id cards , any age proof -they were asking for voter id or pan card).
Overall 2/5.. I suggest this is not a that much good place for friends hangout...

What's Up Cafe has made a name for itself within a short time in Kolkata. It is now the go-to place for young people nowadays.It is located in Southern Avenue,just opposite to the Nazrul Manch.

We went in a group of 16 people,however as the authorities were not letting us to keep tables for our friends as it was Saturday.Nevertheless,all of them arrived and the party began. We sat outside and the view from the top was breathtaking.

We went for one half chicken tandoori first.It was served with fresh salad and a green yoghurt gravy.The chicken pieces were delicious and tender.The salad was fresh and delicious.

Next we went for french fries.The potatoes were fried to perfection and tasted delicious with the sauce.

Up next,we went for the Nachos which was served with four dips and salad.One dip was too sour and had rajma in it.That dip was a disaster.The nachos went well with the warm cheese dip.The salad was also delicious.

Next,we ordered crispy chili baby corn. This item was horrible as it tasted bland and had little baby corn in it.We also ordered chicken hakka chowmein which was also very dry.

Up next we ordered Rissotto Primavera which was good in taste.We also ordered Arrabiata Veg Pasta whic was delicious to say the least,we also ordered non-veg pesto pasta which was delectable.The chicken pieces were tender and juicy.

For dessert,we went for sizzling brownie with ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce and blueberry cheesecake. The sizzling brownie was delicious but the cheesecake was the star of the show.It was the most delicious cheesecake that I have ever had.

The staff was a bit rude sometimes and they certainly need to work on that.

The pictures you have seen isn't actually that good.. 
The place is on like 7th floor or more! 
Only 4 person can go at once, rest has to wait for the lift to come back and take them! 
The people out there will keep staring at you, wasn't really a comfortable place for me.. you will find it crowded! 
Food was also okayish.. I wasnt really delighted by the food.. 
Place rating overall - 4 out of 5 
Food - 3.5 out of 5

Opted for an indoor table and ordered Roasted Chicken Nachos and Oregano Crushed Chicken Tikka Kebab. The Chicken Tikka was the softest chicken tikka I have ever tasted with exact flavor. All in all, an amazing experience. Well done, What's Up!!!

Presentation of the  food was nice  but in terms of taste(Chicken 65 and club sandwich)that was okayish type.But I love the taste of blueberry cheesecake . Staffs are well trained and courteous.

I visited this much hyped care on a weekend along with my bestie & as was expected the place was full of the brim. Though we wanted to sit outside we were told all seats are 6 seaters which was disappointing us but they also told us to wait saying they will do their best. Finely the manager made some space & allowed us to seat outside albeit sharing with another  couple which was ok with us & the ambiance & the overall feel of the terrace is just divine. The staff were courteous & specially the manager who took a lot of effort to accommodate us in middle of so much crowd & this itself calls for an extra point. Coming to food we ordered quesadilla, chelo kebab & kebab platter along with Heineken bucket (4+1). The food were awesome & the chelo kebab deserves a special mention. Thumbs up to what's up. Will surely recommended to all my friends. Keep up the good hospitality...

This café is one of the best in open area cafés. It is famous for it's ambience and for the great view that can be seen outside. The place has one of the best services but I found it to a bit slow. The roof top is the best place to sit and enjoy the delicious food. 
   However, the place needs to be a bit more fast with the food service. One of the best dishes of the café is The cheese cake and the veg pizza and not to forget the Oreo shake... 
The jacuzzi sums up the whole ambience.

Rating given mostly based on their decor and ambience. Food was okayish. We had pan fried chilly fish and some chicken. We had quesadilas which was good. Cocktails were average in taste and presentation but higher on alcohol content. The place is very popular among youngsters as it seems. Always crowded. The staff were too friendly. I wish they add few more options in the cocktail menu.

I have visited this place alot of times and have come back with alot of memories , sometimes with school buddies , sometimes with college friends, this place offers both indoor and rooftop seating and both will mesmerise you. Located just near golpark crossing , which is easy to locate is an awesome place to arrange an get together with your group and grab couple of drinks and have amazing food. Let's come to the point one by one.
The ambience of this place is so good enough that you cannot let the beer glass go away from your hand. This place provides the best rooftop view in all over Calcutta, with music playing in the background with so ample volume that you can go on a discussion other your friends.
The food and the drinks are even good , I will especially refer the cocktail section , they are very good at it.
The service is very friendly and they does not keep your order on queue for a long time. 
This place is no doubt a must visit place again and must try out one too :)

This review is on the basis of visits during December 2016 through February 2017.

Food

Tasted about 7-8 items there in total. Went for all finger food and sides. All of them were perfect. Some were better than others. If I had to recommend one, I would recommend the spicy cheese fondue with popcorn chicken.

Drinks

The cocktails are wellmade. The screwdriver is my favourite. Not bitter, not sweet, just orangy vodka. Other cocktails are good too. They usually have all the options in the menu. You can expect to get your first choice of beer, whiskey, or anything.

They are very strict about one thing. You must carry an age proof. Even a picture of it in your phone will do if not the document itself. But they tally the face carefully. If you cannot produce an age proof they will just very politely make sure you don't get a sip.

Ambience

Beautiful as you can see. The upper terrace is reserved sometimes. But you can get a table at the lower terrace if you wait. It is also obviously a smoking zone. There are two tables where you can dip your feet. The water can have some food floating sometimes though. :/

The crew is very well behaved and professional. They know exactly how to be polite and welcoming without getting chatty. The service is prompt. During the very busy hours, they do attend to you even just to say it'll take a little time.

The crowd is decent. There's music but not so loud that you have to scream to be heard by the next person.

For a lover of serene ambience with good food and tasty potent cocktails, this is a must visit.

Guess I have just been to one of the most amazing cafes in kolkata. The ambiance, the view from the rooftop and the interiors will simply blow your mind. Very courteous staff, the manager for all out to make you feel comfortable. Tried non veg kebab platter. Quantity and taste both were good but the whiskey sour they make deserves a special mention.  Overall an amazing experience and I am surely gonna recommend to my friends. By the way tgeu also had a love performance on which added to the experience.

Ambiance: Nice view of the city below, though a bit congested & the music was a bit loud. It's somewhat like 
Shacks seen in Goa but lacked that Atmos.. didn't found it much extraordinary & appealing..

Service: Was good the behavior of the Staff was also good.

Food: Too overpriced, the quality not that satisfying.. and extraordinary.. 

SPECIAL MENTION: the lift they have is bad & can carry only two people at a time & some time they take 4 cylinder at a time.. instead of people..

The ambiance was  good. We were there at around 2pm , it was very sunny outside so we couldn't  sit on the roof (although you can go to the roof anytime to take pictures :P) . You should go there around 4-5pm to enjoy the roof top open air view. So we started with Irish virgin mojito(2), chicken roulade ( 1), then non veg pasta in formaggi sauce(1) and thai prawn red curry with steam rice(1). All the foods were tasty. Specially roulade and thai curry. But the price is on the higher side definitely i would say.Our total bill was around 2000 (for two people). But you should definitely give it a try.

This is a place tucked in the Southern Avenue that could turn into a cosy hangout had it wised so. Having said that I should also mention the fact that I visited with a friend for lunch on a very sunny afternoon -- and it being so sunny, we could not enjoy the outdoor seating which the place promotes. We chose a table inside. Now coming to the staff -- well they need training; and one was very bossy trying to overrule anything that my friend tried to order. Coming to the food, we tried the lemon coriander soup and thai green chicken curry with rice -- we liked it. we ordered cheesecake for dessert -- and that was very hard -- as hard as brick.

Love this place!

Went there on an early Friday evening to catch up with an old friend, and even around 7 PM, this place was full. The crowd was awesome (and beautiful). I was crushing over the bartender as she handed me a nice cold beverage! :D  The staff was courteous, and we shared the jacuzzi table with a group of ladies who didn't mind us being there. The jacuzzi experience itself turned out better than I had expected, with bubble jets moving the water and all, and even though the whole outdoor arrangement was a small one, it had this overall happy and upbeat vibe to it. Love this place! (x2)

The only reason I'm taking 0.5 out, is because they only had kingfisher. Not really a problem, but hey, come on man! such a nice place and just one type of beer? :( 

Would love going back here any number of times. Highly recommended.

Open Air Deck! Yeahh... The ambience just wowed me as it was a pleasantly cold winter evening and I, was with the best company looking for someplace to chill.. And here we are! With greens all around and just in time for the sunset.. 4-5pm is the best time to go there, I'd say! 
So we started on a ordering spree.. Going for, Chicken Lasagna, Thai Green Curry, Grilled Fish with Lemon Basil.. The food was simply mouth-watering, with the Thai Green curry making me go weak in my knees.. I'm often heard quoting that place for the same! 😁 
Staff and seating didn't comfort me too well... The chairs are not that cosy, and neither is the staff. 
Oh.. And before I forget.. You just have to check out the washroom once! Fancy me saying that.. But, you'll know what I'm talking about once you're in! 😉

One word - AMAZING!! The roof top view during sunset is just out of the world.. And if u got to seat in the jacuzzi, then you can't ask for anything better. Well yes that's exactly what we got. 
Music is nice and gives u a mood to swing if you are high ;-)
Food is good especially the chicken lasagna. Pizzas are thin crust and very crispy.
But a little heavy in pocket, though it's totally worth it.

I was craving for this place which has created a lot of hype in town and finally went there last sunday wih one of my friend. 

This place has some amazing interiors and it's a nice, rejuvenating rooftop pub where you can sit back, have some beers and relax. 

The crowd comes in is young, you get good music and the attractive part of this pub is there a small pool kinda place where you can dip in your feet and chat and order drinks and enjoy. 

Must check out place!

What's Up Cafe certainly has one of the best roof tops in all of Kolkata! The view is just majestic! Overall, they have a lot of different seating areas between the two floors. They have done a really funky job with their blue lighted bar-side seating area. Also equally cool is the jacuzzi tables! You most certainly should book in advance to enjoy this. My personal favorite was the open area on the top floor, towering over the open area on the lower floor and away from a lot of hustle and bustle. Unfortunately, when we arrived the whole of open area was reserved and we sat in the upstairs indoor area - which has almost as good a view as the open area. It was a Tuesday evening, and yet the place was booming with people!

We ordered American Corn and Spinach Cheese Quesadillas, Mediterranean Pizza, Chilly Chicken and Chilly Paneer along with a few cocktails. All of them were quite good! But at the same time, none of them made me feel oh wow! They give ample portions of fry-yums on the side of your drinks which were really quite great! I liked the service. Staff helped us select our order, which was quick to arrive as well.

We had a great evening here...and longed to spend more time. Perhaps another time. This place has a great vibe to it and I am sure it will definitely impress you! Do check out! :)

I'm sure I should have visited this place a lot earlier. A rooftop cafe, a lounge, that's all you need right to hang out with you dear ones. The place is well located on the back side of Gariahat. The food, well we just ordered blue lagoon and lime soda. What appealed me more was the roof top spacing and the water pool inside. I mean you can literally sit sipping you mocktail while having you foot inside water. That's so refreshing. They stopped hookah service but that's gonna start very soon.
A must visit for one and all!

What was fairly exciting on paper turned out to be a washout in reality. The open space which is the highlight here is split across 2 levels, making it quite cramped and generally unappealing. One of the staff members seemed to have an attitude problem (smart aleck answers), from not giving us the menu to taking our order for pizza and saying the wait time will be 2 hours! It felt like a clear lack of training. If you think this should strictly be about the food, the starters looked great. I quite liked the arancini balls. The spanakopita was stuffed with spinach, no problem, but there was just no flavor. Main course was a disaster. With pizza not being an option, we had the bechamel pasta and chargrilled veggies with cilantro rice. The pasta was a salt overdose and the rice was a green chilli overdose. 

Finally, why does a restaurant self-proclaiming to be a café play Bollywood music louder than a pub is a mystery. I’m struggling to come up with positives.

If something less than this was available, I would have given it. Needless to say, zomato is bursting with 4-4.5 ratings of this newly opened restaurant. Hence finally got the time to check out this place.
Must say, it was a horrible experience. Firstly, it is always crowded and on weekdays you have to wait in the evenings. But my review is only based only on service. 
After asking for thrice to call for a person to take the order, we were kept waiting for 20minutes without any  further information when can I place the order. 
Filled with anger and a worst feeling, had to walk out. Still the service people were not around to take any order. 
So not comments about the food but the service was horrible.

It was a bit refreshing experience compared to other rooftop based locations or themed restaurants. However, feet in pool system was something that is good during the summers. However, in winters, its a bit not to much to liking. The food otherwise is not that great. The ambience, service (which was a wee bit slow in my case) is the only thing that sets it apart from the other similar restaurants. They no longer serve Hookah, however, they can insure that people that do are separated from non-smokers. Apart from that, please reduce a bit of your rates and introduce some variety of Cocktails and food delicacies.

Hi There,

Visited this place today and found only one thing interesting... the view from there!!
The most over priced restaurant in the city... they charge you 95 bucks for a sprite can!!! Plus taxes extra!!! 
1.5 rating given just because the food and ambience was average!!
Staff's take too long to respond to what you ask for... had to wait 15 minutes for fryms as they give it with the drinks( Complementary) when the drinks were served within 5 minutes!!

They have roof top seating arrangements at two different elevations. They also have two indoor seating arrangements one at the lower elevation and another one at the top.
I had made a prior reservation for the highest elevation roof top seating ( the view was really nice ) and I would recommend it strongly because it's otherwise really difficult to get a seat there.
We did not try any food. We went there for drinks and hookah. 
We had ordered four beers (+1 free) and a hookah. 
We were charged a bill of Rs.1700 approximately which is a bit pricey. 
The service was good. Ambience was not what I had expected. The people seating next to us were really talking loudly. 
Good to visit with friends for casual hangouts.

But u guys seriusly need to work on ur food quality & its taste. The food we ordered was not that lips smacking. Whether its BabyCorn or Brownie,, Hakka Noodles or Schezwan Noodles. Rest is all Ok.

Awesome place to hangout with your special one and friends. Located just opposite nazrul manch at southern avenue. UBER cabs from any where in Kolkata/Howrah/Sealdah will carry you there. E1, AC 1 bus also comes directly as it takes southern avenue route before reaching golpark. Alternatively if you come from dumdum/sealdah...take a metro and get down at kalighat/rash behari and than take a auto to reach..
I loved the ambience the most. As it was Sumday evening so everyone tables were engaged and we couldn't get sit in the rooftop area at the first. But after requesting and saying as it was our first time visit..so they allowed us to sit in the table where you can dip your legs in Jacuzzi and seat.
Talking about the food and drinks... ordered Kingfisher ultra as other brands of beer was not in stock that time. Pasta arabiatta was very tasty along with chicken 65 with a twist. Next time would like to try Grilled chicken in red wine sauce.
The staffs are very well behaved and they knows to satisfy their guests. The bar tender named gave me his personal number so that when we visit he can he can reserve a table of our choice for us..  overall happy with everything.
Thanks team What's up. Cheers.

As i read so many good reviews about this place we went to celebrate Christmas here. The place is quite good. The view from the rooftop is beautiful. Food tastes good. We ordered 4 chicken sandwich and 1 Turkey sandwich. Unfortunately they did not serve those 4 chicken sandwich. We waited for like almost 2 hours. Then a waiter said we have to change our order cause chicken sandwich was not not available. It took them 2 hours to inform us. So we had very bad experience here. Our Christmas was almost ruined. But the turkey sandwich we had was good. We only had that sandwich for which we paid ₹399. So yeah it was expensive. I would like to visit the place again for the ambiance. I hope they will serve us food next time.😅

What's up is one of my favorite  places at Kolkata and I think, the place has the best view of Calcutta from the rooftop, keeping in mind Blue and Beyond.

I like the management at this place and the service is top-notch. I like to catch p with my friends at this place when I visit the city and my all-time favorites are beers (I prefer the bucket which has 4 + 1) along with pan fried chili fish and pesto pizzas.

The options for beer was very less so went for Kingfisher. Also ordered cocktail as caprioska though I m disappointed with it, there was no vodka taste in it. Will visit again for the jacuzzi feeling...

If you are looking for a place to just sit and chill with your friends over booze....this might be your ideal destination. This restaurant has seats, both interior, as well as out on the rooftop. And it also offers a special attraction with a jacuzzi. Consider yourself lucky if you manage to get a seat there though. The view is pretty amazing, irrespective of where you get to sit. 
You mainly get finger food over here. So don't expect a wholesome meal. Each of the items are quite tasty too. However we found the chicken dishes a little extra salty. 
If you are not much into beer, you can try the cocktails as well. We even got a complementary cocktail when they saw us celebrating the birthday of one of our friends. 
Overall excellent service, nice ambience with a good choice of songs playing and a perfect place to hang out with your buddies.

Great Experience. Awesome foods with perfect ambiance.  We spend almost 3 to 4 hours but we did not get bored.  Location is just opposite to Nazrul Mancha.  A rooftop seating area is so good and a unique pool table where you can reflex provided its empty. the washroom was a bit clumsy. t But he  food and drinks were very good and the service of the waiters were also good. They don't serve hookah or shishait any more. Overall great place to hangout with friends.

So I went to this place twice in a week. Both the times with a big gang. The 1st visit was with the Choreo Club post our triumph at a competition and the 2nd was with the people from my wing, a birthday treat.  The place is unique in the sense that it is one of the few places in the city which has a rooftop seating area and a unique pool table. So in our 1st visit, comprising of 20 odd people, we got ourselves the 1st top layer.  The seating arrangement was quite awkward- high chairs and low table. Don't see the point. In my next visit, consisting of 11 people, we ensured that we got ourselves the pool table where we can deep our legs in the water. The indoors was also nice with a bar and an adjacent seating area filled with sofa tables and also for couples. For the food, though I seem to forget what we have had in our 1st visit, the 2nd visit dishes were mostly te following: 
1. Chicken Reshmi Kebab
2. Fish Lasani
3. Cheese Foundue
4. Chicken Bruschetta
5. Margherita Pizza
6. Quessidilla
On the drinks side, we had the following:
1. JD
2. Virgin Mary
3. Pina Colada
4. Adam & Eve
5. 5 Beer Buckets
6. Jager Bomb
Most of the mocktails and cocktails, you can skip as they are not good. With regards to the service, I must say that they were wanting. Either because of the rush or we were turning out in quick numbers but these people were not able to cope with the same. Also, when the crowd swells, you tend to get into each other's way which is not a happy experience if you have come with females to this place. One good thing was that on the 1st visit, we got entertained by live music, which was great. So they do make it up in other ways.

An open to sky restro pub ideal for young group or likeminded friends of any age. Will not recommend it as a family restaurant. The food and drinks were very good and what was touching was the service of the waiters. Only lacuna could be the slowness in delivering the food. It earlier served hookah or shisha but now they don't serve it any more. 

Tried the following there : 

Mocktails/drinks 
Iced tea 
Kiwi delight 
Green island 

Foods 
Chicken 65 with a twist 
Chicken Reshmi Kebab 
Button mushroom Crostini
Quesadilla 
Crispy Chilli chicken

Perhaps the most beautiful rooftop bars in city besides Blue & Beyond. While the central Calcutta bar boasts of the remarkable city skyline dotted with the primary landmarks of the city,  the south Calcutta bar is set atop the Rabindra Sarobar lake and a much cleaner skyline. The central bar boasts of live folk music and sometimes live flutes and instrumentals which appeals to the thinking drinker, the southern bar plays modern pop on an LED TV appealing to the new gen drinkers who don't mind listening to each other while drinking. Food is quite good,  staffs are very well behaved, courteous and considerably prompt. Prices are on the higher side,  but the ambience tops all.

Ever wondered how it feels to have your legs knee deep in water as you are happily getting high?. Go check out this place to know more. As you walk into this place the roof top will blow your mind with the amazing view it offers. The food, the ambiance is top notch. The only thing i would have liked to improve is the space as the place remains well crowed and sometimes causes a little space crunch. One must try cocktail here is the bone crusher. Keep sipping into it as you indulge in its beautiful flavors and soon you will respect its potential. Statutory warning : If you plan to have a couple of them, do have a friend to drive you back home. :).

Bad food and bad service.. I called for cottage cheese steak with risotto rice.. Was served a too mashed chena tikki in the name of steak with really bad tasting cheese sauce and cherry on the cake was stir fried COLD vegetables and I must mention the entire food was cold too.. on complaining they just heated  my plate in microwave.. Instead of giving me a fresh dish.. As a result of reheating  the cheese sauce became too thick and vegetables lost their crunch.. Very disappointed..

Best for it's outdoor sitting.
Though the pool area was not available at that time. The staff is polite and friendly..
We had beer, crispy chicken, crispy baby corn, lime soda and pina colada. The mocktails were good. Crispy chicken had the right amount of crispness and spice to it. But didn't liked the baby corn. Price is on the higher side.

Visited this place with a friend.
I wanted to sit in the open area.But to my disappointment all tables were reserved or they kept it reserved for a larger group as we were just two people.After much request also we were not provided a seat outside saying those were reserved,although those were empty till we left..
So,I would suggest one should go only after prior reservations,if u wanna try the Jacuzzi or have a seat in the open area.
Overall it had a nice ambience.Nice music.Perfect for a romantic date with your special one.
It wasn't much crowded.
We ordered minced chicken lasagna,which was oozing with cheese and was yummiliciuos.I just loved it.I also wanted to try the cocktails,but the day being a dry day,we couldn't.
One negative point is that the service was not too prompt.

On the top floor of a seven storied building on Southern Avenue, the cafe has a fantastic view of the city from the open deck. The jacuzzi was very good but unfortunately the food took way too long to be served. We had to wait for almost half an hour for the food to be served.
Coming to the quality of the food, the lasagne was tasteless and the twice cooked mushroom plate was also a let down. The food killed the entire mood and even the beat pumping music couldnt compensate for the loss.
Big time improvement in the quality of food and the waiting time is required.

Just like a gem, it's a small yet beautiful place. We visited here on a week night but it was fully booked. But the manager was kind enough to accommodate 6 of us. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this place is the outdoor view and the ambience. An amazing rooftop ambience which is made even more beautiful by the view from the top of the roof. Its like you can see the whole Kolkata from that roof. Another little interesting thing is that there is a table which is inside a small jacuzzi. 

Now coming to food, I loved the appetisers that they serve. Both veg and non-veg appetisers were simply amazing, We ordered Mushroom bruschetta, Nachos, Fettuna Formagi, Kung Pao fish, cajun chicken. The best I believe was the cajun chicken in non-veg and the bruschetta in veg. Especially the sauce that they serve along with it is amazing, Coming to the main course, I think the best among everything we ordered was the margarita pizza. Even though it's simple, the way they cook it with so much cheese, it's simply amazing. They bread was crispy and full of cheese, it is in the list of best pizzas I ever had. The lasagna was good but little high on black pepper. All in all, I loved the experience and it was a night well spent.

Also, I would like to mention about the hospitality of the staff, which made the visit even better.

Value for money - 4/5

Food 3.8/5

Ambience 4/5

Went there on Republic Day and we were disappointed. We forgot about dry day. But...  Majorly, because of the lazyness of the staffs. It wasn't at all upto the mark. The view and ambience was great. The service was very very poor . They neither give water nor asked for it. Took around 30 min to come up with a cold coffee. 

We went there in late afternoon. The main attraction is the atmosphere .. and this will be different when evening sets in and the lights are on.

This is a rooftop cafe located at the 6th floor of the building which is opposite to Nazrul Mancha. A big neon lighted guitar sign will greet u at the entrance on the ground. You can't miss it. Went there for Trippy Tuesday last week, which is essentially Ladies night. Selected cocktails were on the house and that's what I chose to have. Didn't try any food as I was quite full when I arrived here that day. The cocktails which I had were:
Pink Lady
Sex on the beach
Mojito
Screwdriver
Key West Cooler
Caprioska
All of them were pretty good in taste with decent quality of alcohol within it. My favourites were the Key West Cooler and Caprioska. There are three seating areas,one indoor,one out on the roof with a jacuzzi table and another floor built on the roof. The view from the roof was amazing. The cafe and the bar was lit up in neon shades. I was lucky enough to get a seat at the jacuzzi. Dipping ur feet and legs in a tub of bubbling,warm jets of water on a winter evening is an incredible experience. They also had a music performance lined up. But as they were taking too much time to set up and start,I had to miss it. Overall,good place to hangout, extra points for the ambience :-)

Located bang opposite to nazrul manch, at southern avenue, very easy to locate. 
On the 6th floor, with a decent high rise view of the area. It has 3 sections of seating area and one floor on the rooftop. 
Ambience is pretty good, decor is attractive and also the washrooms are pretty attractive (people looking for selfie spots;) ) 
I feel the portions of food is a not sumptuous as compared to the price charged. Also food is nothing extraordinary. Decent taste and preparation. 
Outdoor seating is preferable for me. 
They have live music gigs going on every now and then and attractive events and offers. So surely do drop in to have a good time :)

I had heard from my friends that a very happening cafe had opened its doors near southern avenue and since then visiting this place had been on my bucket list. I was given a surprise birthday bash in this cafe... How lucky am I?! :)
Well for starters you need to have a pretty and amazing sister and also a friend who tries to make things special for you. 💃
The cafe is located on the sixth floor of a building and you can take a lift up there if you are not so fit and athletic-y like me. The lift took us to the fifth floor I think and then we had to take a flight of stairs upto the cafe. The decorations on the wall near the entrance of the cafe was soo quirky and cool. I could actually spot some of the caricatured form of Bollywood starlets from their famous/infamous roles on celluloid.
As soon as you open the door and enter the cafe, you go into a different zone altogether. The music is pretty good... As in they just play some tracks of the newest pop music, but it's usually with the lyrics so that the customers can sing along and enjoy their time at the cafe. The interiors are done up beautifully to give it a feel of an old room with bricks sticking out and all... Almost like any posh cafe in Mumbai looks like. The room with the brick has your regular seating facility whereas outside this room you have a bar with some really quirky bar stools. Outside of the bar was the smoking zone with outdoor seating facility and beautiful glass tables and a lush green surface to walk on. There was even a table where you could dip your toes inside a Jacuzzi while enjoying your favorite meal with your group of friends. There's even another floor with absolutely transparent glass like stairs to another seating place with a few tables. This place seemed like it was for the people who preferred to lay a bit low and have a important conversation, here the music wasn't too loud.
-------------------
-------------------
Now coming to the food...
We had formagio which is a pasta with vegetables and cheese. It was really nice but a little less tangy for my palate.
Chicken 65 which was OK OK.. there was not anything special about it.
Crispy chilly baby corn this was the best of the lot... It was tangy and sweet and very crispy.
Twice cooked mushroom with vegetable and feta cheese... It was not that great. The mushrooms lacked flavor. It was served on a bed of crispy noodles which weren't properly seasoned.
Prawn in honey Hunan sauce - the only good thing about this dish was the prawns were very fresh. Other than that, may be the taste was good but the preparation was not that great, the gravy didn't look appetising enough. It had lumps.
Other than this we had a few drinks like VAT69, beers, vodka and coke.
-----------------
-----------------
Another thing, my sister had celebrated another of her friends birthday here, and whatsup had given them a complimentary birthday brownie then, but I didn't get anything of that sort.
The service was okay. Some of the waiters were really nice, they came over and wished me and I think one of them sang me birthday wishes.
The only reason I am giving this cafe a 3.5 is because of the beautiful interiors and the amazing view of South Calcutta from the top. I would really like to visit this cafe again... But I hope they improve the quality of their food, because a "okay okay" food doesn't quite add up to the awesome decor of this place. This place can do better and it does have the potential.
Do give this place a try!
Cheers 🍻

Been there last week at my friend b'day party. A perfect place to spend with friends, rooftop was just perfect. They also have small pool type section where you can put your legs, & can enjoy the drinks and environment. Sitting capacity is not that big but still you'll manage to get one. 

We ordered chicken65, the classic cheese, Americorn corn sal which all were perfect in taste, but disappointed with the quantity which was a bit low.
I will recommend not to try Nachos, it was below standard. 

A bit costly. But a good place to hang out with friends. One time visit for sure.

Went there a month back after my sem ended.And it ended that day only.My friends and I were searching for a place to relax and chill and we decided upon this place for the open air space.But we were disappointed.Majorly, because of the food.It wasn't at all upto the mark.The view and ambience was okay.We lazed around the jacuzzi as well with a glass of mojito.The food we ordered were a margherita pizza, Lasagne and another dish which I don't remember now though.The pizza was nothing special as wasn't the Lasagne.The tiramisu and blueberry cheesecake were okay though.Another thing that was very very poor was thier service.We asked for a glass of water and the waiter didn't listen properly and completely forgot.Later we had to again remind that guy.The food took time to be served as well.
I will go with a 3/5 coz of the ambience only.We went there in late afternoon.But I guess the atmosphere will be a bit different once evening sets in and the lights are on.For the ambience, you can try this place.Or else, there's nothing to look forward to.

Crispy chicken was very tasty and quatity was also very good :)

Coming to Pizza , pizza is thin crust , the size is very big , can be taken by three people easily , tasty too
In love with the pan masala flavour hookahh :)
Price is bit high
But the ambience and food will definitely drag you to visit once again :)

When one most common word of your daily life and socialisation becomes a restaurant name....... what's up.. yes.. name is enough to draw your attention.. isn't it?

Now, it had been in the wish list from long back. But not really sure whether it will be a worthy to be there or not. So, with lots of speculation we entered.....

Location:
_____________
it's at southern avenue. If you start from goal park more go towards southern avenue , it will be on the main road, on the right hand side. On the 6th floor of a building beside fung sway restaurant.

Decoration:
_______________
This is the 1st thing which will draw your attention.
They have mainly two types of seating arrangement.

Indoor seating: basically it divided into two parts. One is like table seating, another is seating in front of bar counter. It's very nice and very eye catchy.

Out door seating: i felt this is their USP. They have the small pool type, u can enjoy your drink having chilling beside the pool. You have the option to have it leg in the pool also, but afraid it was 13 degree today :P

One thing: we visited it in day time. If possible try to visit it in evening. It will be more more attractive for sure.

Food:
_____________

Have spent a lot of words already, so what about food and beverage .. is it good or not?

Okay let me tell you it's another USP of this restaurant.

* Starters:
______________

♠ Chicken Angara kebab:. Excellent in one word. 7 pieces of chicken, juicy. It was just like melted in mouth.

♠ Fish Kung pao : nice one. Not too good. But yes fish could have been a bit soft.

* Main courses:
________________

♠ Chicken schezwan Noodles: very good in taste. You can eat it with out any side dish it's that good.

♠ Prawn in honey Hunan sauce: good one. Going well with the noodles.

♠ Chicken ham lasagn : the first thing which will draw your attention is the decoration. It's taste very nice. I would not say it's the best. But taste is very good.

♠ Chicken involintin : just superb. Continental dish. Stuffed chicken breast cooked in rich red wine sauce, served with veggies. Owssum.

♠ Grilled fish : owssum one. They served bhetki. Served with lemon butter sauce and boiled veggies. Superb.

* Beverages
______________

♠ Beam Alexander: this one is cocktail. A perfect blend of Jim beam white, chocolate and cream. Owssum one.

♠ Sangria : nothing to say about this. Red wine with fresh fruits. Superb.

♠ Kahlúa : this is basically one type of liquor. coffee-flavored sugar-based liqueur from Mexico. The drink contains rum, corn syrup and vanilla bean. Very nice. And their presentation of the drink is a eye treat.

♠ Kiwi mojito : superb one. Damn refreshing.

♠ Green apple mojito: another superb refreshing beverage.

♠ Country lemonade: we took it at last after having our food. It was oswwum. Very refreshing.

Dessert:
____________

After having so much of food , we were in a mind whether we would take the dessert or not.

And thankfully we took it, otherwise we would have missed the best I guess.

They have very small section of dessert , only four. And we took two of them and it was bang on.

♠ Tiramisu : it is a popular coffee-flavoured Italian custard dessert. Owssum in taste.

♠ Seasonal flavoured panna cotta :one of the best panna cotta I have till date. And for the season we got the nolen gur panna cotta. And trust me it was just heavenly in taste.

So... With the great end of our experience there, only one thought came to my mind, thank God we came here at last.

The person serving were very nice and well behaved.

Total cost is a bit higher , it was 6500 INR for 5 heads, it includes 850 of tax also :P

But yes team What's up you guys are superb. From the decoration to the food.. we found it that good. Hope to visit you again , but this time in evening hopefully. Cheers :)

Would rate their:
Ambiance: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 2/5 (lower rating signifies higher pricing)
Service: 2.5/5

The food served was great, though quite expensive. Also, it was great to see them asking for a valid id proof to avoid underage drinking. Kudos to that. But what put me off was the painfully slow service and to finally put me off was levying service charges as high as 10% apart from the service tax of 5.6% and vat of 14.5%

I would like to just write about the management of the cafe since reviews have already been written about the good ambiance and food(which i agree with).

I  reached this cafe at 11:50 (10 minutes before  their  opening) and I was about to leave seeing that it would have taken time for the cafe to start serving. However, the manager spoke to me and politely asked me to wait if I was not in a hurry and tended to me and my friend in the most respectable manner possible. The hospitality is great. You will feel warm and welcomed whenever you visit this cafe and I think this is one of the most important reasons of going back to the cafe apart from the availability of wide variety of food and the rooftop seating arrangement.

Leave apart the food (its obviously awesome, esp Pizza), the first day I went I saw Dev (Deepak Adhikari) and met Mr. Chandra Kumar Bose, BJP's West Bengal Chief Ministerial candidate. 

That's deserves much more than 5*.

I visited this place last evening with two of my friends and I am highly pleased. The rooftop ambience, the crowd, the music, the food, the drinks..Everything was great.
We ordered a plate of arabiata pasta and it's the best I have ever had with a very good balance of sauce and the spice content was on a higher scale which was absolutely just in accordance to my taste. Then we also ordered chicken BBQ sandwich which was okay. The food quantity was moderate.
Coming to drinks, we ordered a Calrsberg, Sex on the beach and Cosmopolitan. Loved how they present the cocktails.
The only thing which could be worked on is the service. In all, it's a good place to hang out with friends.

I can definitely not say every item on the menu was great but I’d suggest take the help of the waiter- the items he suggested were too good. The polo chicken tenders were just awesome-they melted in my mouth as I relished the tangy sauces with every bite. The schezwan noodles were spicy than I expected them to be. And if you want to order a panna cotta, do not forget to ask the fruit he would be using.(It was just given seasonal fruit in the menu). I was disappointed with a mango flavoured one. The ambience is good but you could easily eavesdrop on a private conversation happening by a nearby table. The tables are too close-by. Also given the music and the alcohol one would definitely want a dance floor which is unfortunately absent at the place. I expected the place to be extremely cold in the winter but I guess you’d feel comfortable in a few minutes. The lighting in the open dining  is almost absent - trust me when I tell you I had no idea how my food looked. Yet great backdrops for take some candid pictures. Overall the experience was good for a one time visit with- I’d suggest a few friends than a whole troop.

A tiny junction in the heart of south Kolkata. Location is actually the main catch of this place. It's on 6th floor overlooking the lake. So in any evening, visit this place and enjoy the breeze while sipping on your drink. Makes a perfect ambience.
A few things to be improved though. Drinks menu should have more variety. Sitting arrangements should be better. Music was a turn off though. All in all a nice place to hang out.

The entrance itself has a lively feeling about this cafe, beautiful graffitis to a clean wide staircase leading you to what's up which is on the 6th floor in southern avenue. Obviously it has beautiful interiors as well as a pretty charming sitting arrangement for rooftop. The couches were having newspaper graphics printed all over. Even the washroom had a nice decor and is pretty well maintained.
Coming to food and beverage, we ordered a lemon iced tea, kiwi mojito, cold coffee with ice cream and a fresh lime soda. For food we had samak makli, which is Lebanese style pan seared fish. The fish was tasty and had been seasoned, marinated really well only thing necessary was it needed to be heated up well before serving.
The beverages are the best part of this place, loved them all! Looking forward to taste few more brilliant dishes in near future.

One of the best place to hangout in town. In the southern Avenue a rooftop place with astonishing view. As I'm a north Calcutta lad so it was a bit far for me. But it was worth it. From drinks to food everything was just awesome. The only flaw was their staff. As I asked for a Miller they said they don't have that so I switched to another one. But after 5 minutes they served other peeps the same. And when I asked they gave such a nonsense excuse. So please work on that. Would have rated 4 or 4.5 but the staff thing ruined it... Other than that loved the place.. Peace ✌

Full points for the decor, location and the ambience. The view was beautiful and so was he lighting. The food wasn't that great and could be a lot better. I ordered an Oreo shake and that was just very average. The crispy chilli chicken wasn't crispy at all. The pricing of the alcohol here is not too bad. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice place to drink with your friends which isn't too expensive and not for dining.

Nice place to hang out with friends. The open area is just fantabulous with the jacuzzi. The 6th floor cafe gives you a good view of adjoining areas in and around Southern Avenue. The food is good. The low light ambience is good but loud sound with the monotonous play list is a bit spoiler. The service staffs are courteous and prompt. 

Overall a highly recommended place, looking forward for more visits, especially in the summer just to chill out in the open space of the cafe..

Great ambience.
The place is nicely done up with quirky pieces .

The food is good too.
The Meat lovers pizza & chicken wrapped in ham was pretty good.
They served the JagerBomb inside red bull, which killed the taste.
The Beam Alexander tasted good though.

Not that cheap .
But it's pretty obvious , given the location & the ambience.

Ambience: The ambience of this place is incredible! Awesome music with a peppy beat, makes you want to shake a leg and rises up your spirits instantly. The seating arrangement is great. The glass walls giving you a view outside and the rooftop setting is just mind-blowing. We went there on 31st for lunch, and it broke my heart to not be able to have a rooftop seat. 

Food:

Kitkat Shake- the most amazing Kitkat shake ever!

Chicken Roulade- the crunch, the cheese, the meat inside! Foodgasm is what I’d call it! Just can’t stop gushing about it! 

Chicken Emmensea- though tasty, I found this a tad bit expensive. Another dish ‘Coq Au Vin’ from the restaurant SpiceKraft, is a very close competitor at 295 INR

Meat Lover’s Pizza- although very generous in the amount of meat (chicken peperoni, chicken ham and chicken salami) this wasn’t really the best pizza in town and failed to please me much

Service: service was good, the waiters being very polite and responsive to our queries; getting a seat was a bit of a hassle though, but being there on 31st Dec, I don’t really have much room to complain :)
Pocket Pinch: the lunch cost us 1577 INR, including taxes.

N.B.-

They levy a service charge on the bill amount, but the percentage is not mentioned anywhere. 

Overall, I'm very pleased and wish to visit sometime soon.

Yes, the name piques your curiosity! That's exactly what it supposed to do... What's actually up are the numerous seating arrangements including their claim to fame - the open terrace seating with a fantastic view of southern Kolkata.

The ambience is neo-modern with its caricaturish art strewn all over the place.The music is upbeat trending more towards hip-hop & dance. The waiters attentive, helpful, friendly and smiling.

The food: the cajun spiced chicken came as a pleasant surprise worth it's spicy indianised touch. Though I would have preferred the chicken to be cooked a little more. So use this as a forewarning in case you expect your chicken to be cooked a lil more.

Scampa gamberi prawns turned out to be the delight of the night with its succulent prawns covered with crispy batter made up of probably bread crumbs and semolina. Terrific! Fata-fati as a Kolkatan would express!

The Mediterranean pizza was quite run-of-the-mill and the thin crust wasn't that thin.

The blueberry cheese cake made us feel warm and satiated and my friend gladly refused to share even a small morsel. After much pleading could i extricate a couple of bites.

The drinks were reasonable. We had settled for kingfisher premium pints. This was followed by planters punch which was a little diluted. My advise would be to avoid the cocktails as they are quite diluted though I must admit candidly that the waiter did his best to accommodate to my taste by adding a lil more to make my screw driver a tad stronger...

We left the place with a wonderful feeling similar to what is felt when you have finished watching a feel-good movie...

Now coming to the food, Caesar salad was very nice, veg pizza was okayish, pesto pasta is not good and not recommended at all. Chicken hariyali kebab and fish & chips are very very tasty. Though not very pocket friendly. But Overall an amazing experience.

You guys have become my favourite hangout stop in south kolkata by now. We had been missing this kind of a place for long. Whatsup is the new olypub of South Kolkata (for me atleast). One should try the Turkey dishes from the new Turkey festival menu and Spicy Cheese Fondue with Chicken Popcorn. Guys just go there sit on the terrace watch your kolkata while you sip on your favourite drink and yes it will not go hard on your pockets.

The only thing i disliked about this place is the price of food.  On a bill of ₹1300,they charged ₹600 as tax. This is obnoxious.  How can you charge 45% tax? This thing bugged me.

It's a fully hangout place at its best. The rooftop view can give you an amazing skyline view of South Kolkata. You can also dip your legs in warm water and enjoy the ambience with a glass of beer in hand. Looking forward to visit again post new year rush !!

If I would look for an open rooftop restaurant in Kolkata,which comes at a reasonable price,I would opt for What's Up...

This place seriously has an awesome rooftop from where you can get a magnificent view of Kolkata's greenery🤘🤘🤘🤘
The best part is the rooftop seating area which is really cozy during the winter season.
I mean if you are a group of 5-6 people who enjoy beer and hookah you must visit this place...

For food the Chicken Tandoori is probably the best dish I had here.The pieces were juicy and tender and we'll roasted,served with lettuce leaves,salad and some mayonnaise sauce.
Since it was Christmas Eve a special Turkey kebab was also available.

Service wise really great and the waiters are really courteous....
This is the place to be for any party or a gathering of old school friends.

The only drawback....No dance floor😂😂😂
This place really needs a dance floor at the earliest.I mean,when the music is so amazing and there is no dance floor,the enjoyment drops down.

Otherwise this place desrves a 3.5/5 surely😀

Food and beverage were decent. Tasty but not mind blowing. We ordered the  Meat lovers pizza w/o broccoli, crispy chicken popcorn with special mustard sauce , French fry ,Beam Alexander( Bailey's Irish cream was on the menu but not available for reasons unknown). The fries and pizza were good. The crispy chicken popcorn was definitely crispier than I'd like,but it had nice strong flavour which was balanced with the mustard sauce. I expected the special mustard sauce to be zingy on its own, but it was surprisingly mild flavoured in itself, could not taste the mustard at all.

The Beam Alexander was more  ice than the actual drink(cream, bourbon and chocolate liqueur). Maybe the cold weather was not the best time to pick icy drinks in open air Restaurant. It was good bitter, but not really enjoyable. 

Good view, cozy space:Ambience was nice with rooftop and the view. The seating arrangements  are cozy.  It was too jam-packed for a weekday, but it was NY week.

 Poor Service, Nice Servers- Servers were very polite and were trying to help with a smile. But the service itself was poor, with half orders arriving and prolonged delays for the others. We actually had to wait long for our  Thums up and eventually we get a can and no glass! There were gaps in communication of our orders 

  The best part about the delayed service though was, that no one was rushing for  us to leave, thereby giving us more time to enjoy the weather and conversation.
But there are few things worse than the icy drink on a winter evening ,in an open terrace Restaurant,is the food which will get too cold too soon . But that's part of an open air meal I suppose.

Overall, would like to go back for the view and try more of the menu  and hopefully the service would be better.

The roof has some awesome vibes but perhaps the corner we sat in led to some poor service. It took a bit of time before food and drinks were served too. The food tastes good though and the cocktails were nicely blended. My friend flipped out since they were out of Malibu and Bailey's. All in all, fun and a spectacular night view of the southern kolkata city scape.

Location : Few mins from grub club just opposite to nazrul manch.
Ambience: Pretty great. It's on the 6th floor, has booth indoor n outdoor seating. The place is quite large and the different sections are lit n decorated differently which I loved. Now what's special about this place is the rooftop seating n the jacuzzi tables where u can sit dipping your feet. Though we couldnt get that table which is a bummer! And the view is amazing at dusk overlooking the lake.
Food and service: We ordered a few cocktails which were nice but they seriously need to work on its presentation ( coz the pina colada looked like a glass of lassi ) 😂 3 cheese fondue was nice n warm n perfectly flavored.. but the service was slooooowwwww! If you drop in during the rush hour be prepared to wait for an hour or more..

I am totally in love with this place. I first visted this place during the Puja times. I came back to Kolkata after a long time during the Puja and needed a good place to hang out with friends. One of my friends took me there. Bang on. Waited in the queue. Got the jacuzzi. Wonderful feeling. I visted this place twice. 

Coming to the food. It's very good. But the most important thing is if your are a beer lover, you would love this place. Ranging from bucket to tower, this place won't let you down in terms of drinking beer.

A wonderful place to hang out. If you haven't visted this place, you must visit.

Whatsup has become a well known name among the new set of restaurants at the southern avenue. 
There is a huge buzz about their jacuzzi sitting area, and rooftop dining. The view from the rooftop is amazing. But you need to walkin with lot of luck to find a satisfactory sitting area to enjoy the ambience. 

I checked in after full supper, just to checkout the place. 

We ordered few mock tails and Hawaiian Pizza, All our mock tail were show stoppers. Hawaiian pizza had generous amount of cheese and topping.

The only drawback would be their sitting arrangement which is really uncomfortable, and those sanam puri tracks really spoiled the evening. 

If you have cousins coming from Delhi, Bangalore and hear them complaining about how boring Kolkata is. Bring them to What's Up.

The ambiance is amazing.   Relaxing and yet an energy flows through...

The food is tasty... My favourite is their Thai green curry. It is creamy and full of flavors. 

They need to replace their crockery though... A lot of it is chipped.

This new place located at Southern Avenue was in my must visit list since sitting in bangalore I saw my Facebook feed filled with great reviews and photos of this place. And the pictures really intrigued me to visit this place. So on a Tuesday evening at around 6 went to this place. Location is just great and so did I like the ambience., though we dint get to sit in the open area as it was already occupied. The minus point will be the loud music which is an conversation stopper. But the biggest let down was definitely the food. Had ordered chicken nachos and cridpy chicken popcorn with cheese fondue. The popcornd were not at all crispy and the fondue was bland. Coming to the nachos it was the biggest let down. Nothing in it was like how a nacho is suppose to be. We were not in a mood to order anything else after such a disappointing experience. Would definitely never visit this place again. @mohit gupta

Went there today and loved the place. Sat outside in the open. Lovely view of the Green_Lake_Area. Sun was soothing. Uday (perhaps that was his name as it was mentioned in the bill), was a great server, was smiling and helpful. The human hair discovered in the food was a bit disturbing, but hope they will be careful about all this in future. PORTIONS ARE GENEROUS AND GOOD ENOUGH.

((B))
Prices are average. Affordable. SERVICE CHARGE is included in the final bill @10%, is fair enough, and so no need to bother about Gratuity separately. Hope the surcharge charged is fairly passed on to the server/team.

((C))
~~**OUR ORDER**~~
**Chef's Special Lebanese Spaghetti--
Was tangy and nice, and nice herbs and spices. Only thing that they could have avoided was the special serving of "HUMAN HAIR" which was discovered in the spaghetti as we almost finished off. This was a turnoff. Hope they will concentrate on cleanliness and quality control.

**American Corn Salt and Pepper--
Perfectly crusty and crunchy with not overcooked bits of peppers. Had fun munching this along with the Green Apple Vodka.

**Double shots of Green Apple Vodka on the rocks--
Enjoyed along with the food and under the winter sun.

**Tiramisu--
Was seemingly ok. Can be better.

Thanks.

What's Up is the place that lightens up your mood with its innate beauty, the comfortable seating cushions your tired fall, the serene roof top view soothes your soul and the aroma in the air triggers your hunger to life and you have to wait for the waiter to register your grimace. It feels like eternity.
-The kiwi mojito was refreshing.
-The Cheese Corn and Spinach Quesadilla accompanied with a variety of dips was undoubtedly a better version of the dish I've ever tasted.
- The lasagne was absolutely perfect. I found my tongue and stomach engaged in a constant battle, where the latter was too full to take in any more and the former still lusting for the cheesy top layer and the layers underneath it.
Overall, I found the atmosphere very inviting. Prices are competitive. Service was a bit slow and was carried out in a perfunctory manner. The presentation, enriched by its simplicity and the food speaks out loud with its flavours.

If you are literally asking what's up above this place then it's the sky above this place. In summer you can try their jacuzzi seating as well. Pretty good location and the food was good as well. I like the mocktails and cocktails. One of the better place to hangout as it provides you with everything a cafe can probably server right from food, appetizers, desserts, mocktails, cocktails, hookah and amazing view as well.highly recommended!

People generally have this place on their bucket list. The ambience of this rooftop cafe is pretty good and the jacuzzi is cherry on top of the cake. But the experience of this place cannot be rated as per ambience. Food was okay. Music was mellow when outside. But it was too loud inside. Service was not really that good. But it's a good place to hangout.

Food was average. Music too loud. Service pathetic. The waiter missed to tell us that one of the items we ordered was not available and we got to know that when the kitchen was closed. They didn't even bother to get us any other dish and was very prompt to bring the bill. We had to leave the place with our stomach half empty.

Dear Team whatsup,

I think more than the staff the problem lies with the management. The manager in suits was very much involved in it. It was more for them to leave the restaurant. My point is just for the sales you take the order and then rush the customers. Why not just stop taking the order when you want to maintain timings.

The place is on the nouveau food district of Calcutta. And being in sync with the hip and happening persona the place is decorated in a contemporary and upbeat way... Which I loved... The terrace ovelooks the lake and adjacent gardens and one can see far away which in itself is a treat! Our group sat at what I think was the coolest seat in the house.... It was worth the wait... We sat with our legs dipped in the jacuzzi and enjoyed our Beers and grub and had loads of fun!!! We ordered the Chicken 65 which was hot and spicy as expected and owing to the darkness I bit into a whole red chilli and suddenly I was up in flames!!! The popcorn chicken with mustard Mayo was great! Being super gluttons we also ordered chicken bruchetta which was amazing! And the meat lover's pizza... Which was nice.. only wish the crust was a little thinner! 

I would definitely go to this place over and over again!!! Simply loved it!!! 

Pocket pinch in the range of 3.5k for 5 people and two rounds of beer!

Ambience is good, but bad luck due to crowd didint get the chance to seat at terrace. Talking about the food we ordered nachos , meditereanean pizza and mint mojito. The drink wasn't much good as the i was not the getting that mint flavour ., the drink taste was bitter. Nachos  with four different dips were just awesome.  the taste was pizza was good and i feel ingredients of the pizza was less. however the foods are just delicious.

This place has always been the first in list when i plan a hangout with my friends. You ask why? Its just because of the mind-blowing ambiance,friendly attendants who forgot their attitude back home,delicious food and alcohol. All of these at a very pocket friendly price.

One has to fall in love with this place because the people over there makes you feel at home. The food is always awesome. hot and fresh. The cocktails over here can make you forget about your recent heartbreak. They make sure that the beer is served chilled because serving a cold beer is a sin to them.

The best part of Whatsup is the terrace. My goodness,the view. It always have been the cherry on the top.

Many knows him by the name Anirban and the rest knows him by Jeet. Nowhere you can find such a cool owner who himself checks that each and every person is making the best memories of their life in Whatsup.
Soft spoken,cool and too friendly he is.

make sure to visit this place and i can be pretty darn sure that it will top your hangout list.

Make sure to book a table in advance because you would definitely not like to wait to have the best time of your life. :-)

Went there on Sunday afternoon and the place was overcrowded. So we could not find any place outside and had to sit indoor. It has only 6/7 seating arrangement inside. The loud music would obviously hurt your head as well as ears. The service is a bit unprofessional. They don't even serve beer in a beer mug or glass. So you have to drink it from the bottle only. OMT in every bar or pub I have visited serve complimentary snacks with drinks but they don't serve any.
Coming to food we really have no such complaint. It was good though it was served after a very long time, may be due to the Sunday rush.
The pocket pinch is also on the higher side due to the high amount of tax.
If you are planning to visit this place make a prior reservation in the outdoor otherwise the experience is not good enough.

This was a most satisfying experience. We went for dinner last evening, a party of three. The open air seating on the 7th floor terrace was a boon to the two smokers in the party. Very pleasant.
We ordered samak maki, chicken 65 and prawns in honey Hunan sauce. The last was so good we ordered a repeat. The others were good too but this stood out. The usual evening ritual proceeded smoothly with such fine accompaniments. I apply the term fine with due aforethought. These were fine dishes, not the tongue searing kind.
Dinner was inevitably a lesser affair after this kind of gourmandising with starters. We had Prawn Etouffe and Herbs and Parmesan encrusted fish. Marvellous.
Their sourcing is of sterling quality and the chef does justice, not overdoing anything.
I only wish they had red meats on their menu.

The place is very conveniently located just on southern avenue beside indthalia and pretty hard to miss with the giant glow sign, it has a great outdoor seating area on terrece with Jacuzzi and a great view. We went out on a thursday afternoon and choose the outdoor area first then got back to the indoor area as the sun was too much to handle, we had chicken nachos and meat lovers pizza two mocktails and beers. The price, service, everything is pretty good about this place and pocket friendly too. Best to visit during evening.

Location-Southern Avenue,Kolkata.

What's up is one of the few and antithetic rooftop cafe cum bar you will find in Kolkata and its opening was was much awaited.We call it antithetic because of its jacuzzi section.This place was bookmarked by us few months back and finally we went there yesterday.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place was quite good.As you enter you will see the entrance designed like a vault.The whole place is divided in three section with indoor area,oudoor area with jacuzzi and upper outdoor area.The interiors have been done very well with a separate bar counter.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable.The staff has been trained very well with the dishes but the serving people were not much active as most of the time they will not be available around you.

Food-The food and sheesha both were good.The plating was done very well and food was served fresh and warm.We had-
1:Sigara Boregi
2:Mix sauce pasta
3:Teen paan sheesha
4:Crispy Chilli babycorn


Food-4/5

I wont rate this place. Simply because I didnt have anything (or should I say was denied any service?) here. I am not even penning a review but a precaution for other foodies - always bring your age proof if you want to be served well here.

It has been a few months more than 28 years on this planet for me and for some good deeds of the past life (at least I thought it to be that way till last evening), some of us look younger than our age. Nevertheless, its not a boon for a bar-visit as it seems now. I went to Whatsup after a quick escape from my work place with another friend. There we were offered a good seat, the menu card and only after we told them what food n drinks we would like to have, we were asked to produce an ID card. Why? Because the waiter thought we might be below 21! Fine enough, we had our institute ID (we pursue our research there) with us and unluckily for us, it doesnt contain DoB. Discussions and further discussions, followed by discussions with us and then the manager declared he cant serve us as he doesnt want a trouble by breaking government rules.

Now, I have no issues against government rules. But as far as I know, no single rulesays that I have to carry an age proof whenever I need a drink. I can be asked for it but there can be other ways to check if I am over 21 or not! When I am producing an ID which clearly says that I work as a PhD scholar for a government institute, does that really leave any doubt about my age? I mean logically speaking, you CAN NOT be below 23 before you start pursuing PhD! But the waiter or even the manager didn't seem to understand the fact at all.

An ambience of a place doesn't depend on its decoration or location only. It is built up with reputation that comes from cooperation and good service. Both of us have been to many restaurants and bars across this city, be it Chillis or Xrong Place or whatever else, nowhere we had to face this kind of audacious and tactless behaviour. I dont want to defend myself, as I will be carrying my PAN card since now, but I need to know whether this is what the customer-service relationship has become today. Is this how a successful restaurant runs these days? 

And then when we were coming back, we saw a group of teenagers hopping in. They were clearly regular there and definitely in their high school. Well, I didnt wait to see if they had been served alcohol or not, but clearly they will be :) You can never deny regular customers, can you? 

I am thinking about getting a tatto and an attitude saying 'i-have-a-rich-wallet-and-i-can-make-a-scene-if-denied-service' upon my nose next time I get into this place. Age proof alone wont suffice.

So apparently you're required to produce an ID if you order an alcohilic beverage. Even though its a deterrent to minors getting drunk(sic), an institutional ID isn't enough to ensure that you're above the legal age. Me and friend visited this place and the waiter (apparently 4 years younger to my friend) was insistent upon her produing an ID. When my friend did produce one (her work ID identifying her as a scientist with a government instituitio) our informed waiter insisted her producing her another ID which he could better identify with. The whole experience felt as od thougg trying to get through ans Airline's security!!(apparently the same ID works at the airport but not here :-P). It was a pitiful experience as the restaurant satff were hell bent on ostracizing and rather than facilitating their guests. Two notes for the staff here
1. You could never get a PhD before 21(if you do find someone like that, call up the PRESS they might have a news)
2. If you're really serious about minors consuming alcohol be serious about it and don't use it ostracize ans segregate your guests.

Went with a lot of expectations but was highly disappointed. On entering popular restaurants I am used to smiling attendants guiding us to seats and letting us choose if there are many empty ones available. On entering here the attendant(I don't know his designation) said very roughly what in English stands as "you are 2, sit in that table". We asked about the rooftop seating. He said it's full and we have to sit in that table only. We said let us check the rooftop once and he rudely said what will you do checking. Just sit there.
 We should have left at point only but my bestie insisted that we stay. It's her birthday so I stayed but the behaviour from that person (I don't know his designation) have already spoiled my mood.
The music inside is so loud that you have to lean in and shout to make yourself audible. The playlist also needs improvement.

Coming to the food and drink part. We ordered:
Chicken Ceaser salad: Some of the cabagges were cut in proper small pieces. Rest you can swirl up mlike noodles. It also had too much mayonese to our liking but still it was OK.
Cajun spiced chicken: Didn't like it at all.
Chicken Involuntini: The chicken was too stiff and chewy so we ate the stuffing and had to waste almost half the chicken. The mashed potato was totally bland. The boiled veggies were ok.

Due to non availability of cranberry juice we had to change our drink order. But we were informed about this almost 10mins after placing the order. Then again we had to change our drink order due to unavailability of a certain liquor. Again we were informed 5mins after placing the order. Finally the drinks arrived. The Margarita lacked the kick of tequila.

We then went out to the rooftop for a smoke and to our surprise we found 2 4-seater tables empty. Maybe we lost to the 2 vs virtual 4's group. But our mood was totally spoiled by that time and we didn't want to request the attendants to allow us to sit on the rooftop.

What I found that people come here for beer and hookah. So don't order any fancy food and even the regular cocktails.
I won't revisit this place that's for sure.

this place is as cool as its name and also blends with how well they have arranged doesnt seem so huge just by luking at the entrance. it has every kind of arrangement for every kind of need. no words to explain. but good things has its cons like the lift can accomodate only three people and you have to stand in a queue to enter there which is really a mess also the lift is very slow ,we had to wait for 10 mins to wait for our fourth friend who couldnt come in the lift with us as its in 7th floor . Also inside there are glass stairs on which i saw almost three people falling . Ignoring those silly parts would recommend to go with friends,not much of a family restraunt.

It's out and out an awesome hangout place... There are very few places that is a hookah cum bar and this is one of the best. Moreover it offers a rooftop area with a view over the south kolkata skyline. You can also dip your legs in warm water and enjoy your drink. So ambience wise it's a great great place. Pricing is also quite reasonable based on the pub location and ambience. Drawback is the place is a bit clumsy and the food is not that good. For drinks and hookah... There's no place better i have seen in kolkata

I went in here today.. dis place hav been bookmarked long back.. finally landed here.. wen u enter, d entrance isn't dat exciting evn u may skip dis place if u go after d entrance.. its actually at d 6th floor of a not so well maintained building.. d lift man Wil take u directly to 6th floor.. ambiance is very good indeed very well interior's the roof top is just wow.. Dey hav two roof tops bod d Wel built.. der r umpteen no. Of men to service u.. Wel coming to d food v ordered baby corn, Schezwan noodles, pasta, pizza.. it was kind of ok.. I didn't find it dat lip smacking.. n I also found d service to b slow may b due to d rush of Sunday evening.. overall it's good more preferable for hookah lovers, hookah in open wid beautiful ambiance has its own joy..

Well I went to what's up with my friend after hearing a lot about it. The ambience is terrific. With its rooftop location the surroundings will bring a sweet smile on your face. For the food we tried chicken quesadillia and Hawaiian pizza. The presentation of both the food was eye catching just like in a very posh restaurant. The food was ample for 2 people. And price was affordable for such good food with its lipsmacking taste, presentation and superb ambience( as an add on).

i want to ask that why are you charging WEST BENGAL SALES TAX ?? may i know on what basis u r charging it? because i havent heard about this tax rate. the tax rate is quite high which is about 27%. And u r also charging service charges n service taxes. u cant charge both on the same bill. and also most interesting part they havent show the rate of this service charge. in this way WHAT'S UP earning their money by making FOOOOOLLLLL. I have already attached this billing issue problem in the consumer forum !!!

What's Up has lived up to my expectations. It has always been there in my bucket list since I read about it in the Calcutta Times. Glad that I finally ticked it off, yay! It is situated opposite to Nazrul Mancha. It didn't take us much time to locate it out. The cute-like-button lift takes you up to the 6th floor. And, there you are amidst the creative interiors. The seating arrangement is pretty decent. It has got an open air jacuzzi as well. We chose to order Green Apple Mojito, Pina Colada, Chicken Pesto Pizza( A bowl of chips were provided as complementary), a continental delicacy( I forgot the name) & Chicken Popcorn. The food tasted decent. After gulping them down, we headed for the open air jacuzzi to click some good pictures! :D The view from the rooftop is grand and the slight nip in the air just made it better. The staffs are very courteous and friendly. A thumbs up from me! Keep up the good work guys. I would like to visit this place again in the near future. Highly recommended...!

I'd been here before, and it's physically quite nice, although quite small - there's a glittering bar, and a rooftop section with a fantastic view. So... went in, was in 2 minds as to whether to have a drink or not, anyway went and asked the guy at the bar - "How much is a vodka and coke?" The guy actually *took out a laptop and started booting it!!*, LOL! Now obviously I don't expect that the guy will have the entire menu and the prices in his memory, but he could have just looked at the menu, no...? Well, either the item wasn't there, OR, as I suspect, the price was Without Tax - it did not strike anybody in management that customers do NOT want to do "14.whatever%" (or whatever it is) in their heads WHILE having a drink!! When I had asked him, the guy also looked quite surprised and, I think,  asked me why I wanted to know - I had to impress upon him that customers might like to know the price of something BEFORE ordering it, not after!! - it appeared that this was a concept new to him, and apparently this hadn't struck management either - a way of doing business unparalleled in the whole world!! So - waited. After a while, it appeared the guy's computer wasn't booting or something, so he said "Wait" and disappeared. Waited. And waited. In the meantime, it was quite chilly, so decided to ask one of the other guys behind the bar how much it would cost to have some coffee with something tipsy mixed with it. Asked, once again, it was evident that the guy was not prepared for this question - finally he said "Coffee-r puro dam ta lagbe aar vodka tar-o puro dam lagbe". Well, I didn't want the PURO vodka, just a little bit to liven up the coffee - whatever, decided it wasn't worth the pain of trying to explain this to the guy, and waited. Finally, decided enough was enough, and decided to find the other guy. Went inside, found him near the cashier's desk, ostensibly trying to get the price of that vodka and coke out of the cashier - a pretty girl in a red dress. FINALLY, I think he got it out of her, and he said something like "Two hundred and something..." - whatever, I can't afford that (maybe if he'd told me the price off the bat, I'd have ordered it on the spur of the moment, so he Lost The Sale), and by now, I'd decided that I didn't want something cold anyway, so I said "Just give me a cup of coffee". Went outside - VERY nice, open air, with one table even a jacuzzi type of thing, but it was Reserved, so took a look around and decided to go up. Sat right on top, incredible view, as I said, but it was quite cold, though not being too late in the evening - couldn't wait for my hot coffee to appear. One guy asked me THREE times whether I'd ordered or not - had to impress on him that I'd told that guy, below - if they'd spent that effort on actually MAKING MY COFFEE QUICKLY instead of asking me, it might have made me happier. Coffee took it's own sweet time to come, I think they'd figured out that "This is not a high net worth customer" :) It tasted good, in all honesty, and sipping it, some of my temper went away (I was ready to explode at this point, as you may imagine!). So.... finished, went to pay - it was Rs. *133*/- This is kind of on the high side for a cup of  coffee, isn't it? - I'd had coffee at Aquajava before, and that was 100/- (though I'm not sure whether that was with tax or without), tasted just as good, and the CUP WAS MUCH BIGGER!! So - these guys haven't done their pricing right. When paying, I asked that girl in the red dress whether they take PayTM or not - this was shortly after Modi's announcement,... she said "No", like, she doesn't give two SHITS - not only did the idea not occur to HER, but even when *I* told her, she didn't bother to pick up on it, in fact she couldn't care less. 

So, all in all, HORRIFIC MISMANAGEMENT. And a ruined evening.

Whatever. 

For a bar that doesn't know it's own prices, charges more, AND doesn't care *how it takes its payment*, for God's sake, these guys can do without MY humble two bucks! From what I saw of the menu, the food was bloody expensive, too!

This place is located right opposite Nazrul Mancha and is a five minute walk away from RKM and Grub Club . The cafe is located on the 6 th floor , so one has to take the lift and a few stairs to reach the cafe . The door had a wheel attached that made it look like a secret vault , and the interiors were cosy with comfy sofas and chairs with quirky upholstery and a giant LCD Screen that played Bollywood hit tracks. The glass windows help you see the surrounding buildings and greenery , giving it a nice rooftop feel. The staff were quick and attentive , and we were served our food within 15 minutes of ordering . The Veg Hakka noodles we ordered had enough for two in a single plate , and the Hawaiian Pizza had pieces of pineapple and chicken salami in a cheesy base , and had 8 regular pieces which were filling . The pizza was served on a round wooden tray , giving it that oh so fresh feel and the crust was super thin and almost crispy! The Pina Colada tasted awesome , and had an ice cream base and frothy consistency. The terrace had revolving seats and a false grass carpet , with a pool that should turn on the oomph at night. The music on the terrace was soft and romantic . The view outside was great for enjoying a nice sip in the open air . Overall , a double thumbs up for the concept , design and service of this not so expensive cafe !

The best part about What's Up is that it's super welcoming. Right from the lift, up to the stair cases.

When we entered, the only words I could think off was tiny, not cozy, noisy little place. Tiny, Cozy with noise is still comfortable. But Tiny, Not Cozy with Noise is not comfortable at all.

We couldn't find a place to sit beside a couple of tables being empty. Reason - 2 against a 6 Seater. On requesting them to let us sit, we sat. On a condition that we would move when somebody else comes in a gang of 4-5 or 6. And here they came, and we had to move. We looked for a seat in the other section, couldn't find one. Looked for a seat in the outdoors, couldn't find one. The only seats that were empty were the ones that were super uncomfortable to sit on. Eg- The Unicycle seats, the seats in the blue lit room and the ones in the end of the first section.

Finally we moved to a 2 seater in the first section when the customers vacated. Phew ! Don't know why didn't we leave.

Food. We ordered for a Pesto Pasta, Greek Salad, American Corn and Cheese Quesadilla,  a Strawberry Cheese Cake Shake, Cold Coffee and Virgin Mojito.

-The Pesto Pasta, American Corn and Cheese Quesadilla, Strawberry CheeseCake Shake  -  Good !
-The Cold Coffee had to be change at least three times. Was it good the 4th time ? No. Returned it and ordered another Strawberry Cheese Cake Shake.

-The Virgin Mojito - OVERLY sweet. Couldn't take it.
-Greek Salad - Totally lacked Feta Cheese.

Word of Advice - SHould do something about the seating for sure.

Would I visit again ? - Even though the Pesto Pasta, American Corn and Cheese Quesadilla and the Strawberry CheeseCake Shake were good, I don't see any reason to re-visit again. I'm sorry. Even though the staff were/was friendly, they couldn't do much when we were hobbling around for half an hour helping ourselves find a seat.

The speciality of this place is the outdoor sitting and the great view. I have been to this places many times in the past two months, only because of the beautiful ambience. I have tried the Arancini Balls, Nachos, Chicken Club Sandwich and Pasta, but somehow the food does not have any wow factor. The cocktails are good, though they can be made stronger. The hookah flavors are very bland. The staff is extremely friendly. 

Good place to hang out with friends over good music.

I tried the blue lagoon that was terrible and the long island ice tea was a complete disappointment for the amount you pay! We actually ordered worth rupees 2400 and paid 3600! They fleece you with the taxes! So beware!

Well the irresistible attraction with the name finally compelled me to go their.The rooftop view, jacuzzi,interiors,music everything will make you fall in love with this place
The food was mindblowing  (though a bit costly because of the taxes,they charged extra 27% wb sales tax)
We ordered:
1.Sex on the beach-Great cocktail,really refreshing perfect place to enjoy the drink with the roof top view.
2.Heineken beer-A good one.
3.Hawaiian pizza-Perfect for this weather.Spicy and one of the best thin crust pizza ve ever had!!
4.Blueberry and springwater hookah-Lasted for half an hour,though the flavour was a bit mild.
Ratings:
Food 4/5
Ambiance 5/5
Service 4/5

Would definitely recommend this place to everyone..and hoping to revisit soon.

A place for today's youth and a little out of place for someone who would go for a drink with friends and a good chat.  The terrace is good and I'm sure winter will make it better.  The chairs on the terrace are high but the tables are low..... Extremely uncomfortable.  Mock tails were standard and nothing exciting.  The food was terrible.... The fish stinking  and fibrous.  The chicken seemed stale and extremely hard.  The plates served were so small and inconvenient.... And top it all,  water was not served!!!  And they actually charge you service charge at 10%!!! When it says what's up.... I presumed it's a place to meet up and hang out and chat up over good food!  But it's a hookah bar with extremely loud music and quite cramped for a big group of friends!  Quite disappointed!

I love this place! This was my second visit and I wanted to have a lot of fun. We had just gone for a drink and nothing very heavy. So we ordered Blue Lagoon which is a mocktail, screwdriver- a cocktail and beer. And we also ordered crispy chilli baby corn and fried rice. The amount was good. I mean there were three of us who had ordered just one plate of each and since we were not that hungry it was enough. And everything was pretty good! Tasty food, amazing ambience. Love it! ❤

It's open air restaurant.Its located at Southern Avenue.Its on 7th floor rooftop.
There was a Jacuzzi.but we were two people.so we didn't get the chance to sit there.
I ordered spanakopita and beer..
Spanakopita was a vegetarian dish ..filled with "palang sakh.."
It was not as I expected.. tasteless..
You can get sisha also ....and chilling on rooftop..the view from rooftop is awesome..
It's a really expensive restaurant..they take too much vat and tax.. which I didn't like..
This place is not for students,, college go'ers...
Okay..overall a great experience.. great ambiance...

Well ...a new addition to city's open-air restro list. It's been there in my bucket list for quite some time now and last weekend, got a chance to tick off ! Located at the 7th floor, this joint has got both open air and indoor seating arrangement. Dimly lit place, always buzzing with vibrant young crowd. The air is filled with the odour of sweet sheesha . Neon and LED illumination has given a tipsy touch to the ambience. The music might felt loud if you are seating inside... sometime hurting your eardrums! They have put a small Jacuzzi kind of pool where you can dip your feet and enjoy drinks or food but tough to get this table as people have been queueing up for this all the time. Siting at the upper rooftop area will give you a panoramic view of south kolkata skyline. Now, coming to food... we were a group of four and was in a mood of nibbling some Chakhnas. Here's what landed up on our table :
# Cajun spiced chicken - Succulent pieces of boneless chickens cooked in a moderately spicy sauce
# Chicken roulade - stuffed with cheese
# Polo con aioli - tender pieces of chickens (sauteed with herbs & tastes tangy) , served with a portion of salad, made out of iceberg lettuce, cherry tomato, jalapeno and mayo.
# Gamber scampi with tartar dip - lightly fried battered Prawn
In dessert we tried #blueberry cheese cake, unfortunately it was not a cheese cake at all, rather cheese was replaced by vanilla flavoured cream. Apart from this little disappointment, the overall experience was nice. Food items are fairly priced. Restro staffs are well behaved and courteous. Decent place to hang out with your close buddies amidst pollution-free fresh air and admiring the city skyline over a bottle of beer!

I have been here twice and I have never come out dissapointed or very happy. Some restaurants are there which are just OK and this one is no better.
Normally, a glass of beer and dry chilli chicken with a Pan flavoured hookah is my first order and they are just as expected. Nothing great yet nothing bad. The ambience is OK inside, the jacuzzi/pool side is a little better. Good for chilling out , but I would like to see more additions into the food menu(as well as a better food menu), which would really help. A note for the pizza, that I had in my last visit much after the waiters recommendation, was not upto the standard. Too less cheese and chicken.

What's up is located just opposite to the entrance of Nazrul Manch, in the building next to Indthalia. The cafe is located on the 6th floor. The lift is very small, so if you go in a large group be prepared to wait for some time. However once you enter, you can't help but smile. The place is really neatly done- with unicycle shaped seats, a good looking bar, a jacuzzi and open air seats. The view from the place is great. Went in a group of 7, and we were given the Jacuzzi seats. Yay. We ordered a Paan flavoured Shisha, a bucket of beers, a Chicken Roulade, Chicken Popcorn with Spicy Mayo, A meat lovers pizza, a Chicken Pesto Pizza, and a Margarita Pizza. The chicken Roulade was interesting and is a great option for cheese lovers. However to be honest, the pizzas were just okayish. The service was fast and no complaints whatsoever.

Lovely lovely place, but it can do some improvements in the food department and maybe introduce happy hours! :P

The starters and the main courses were average but their desserts were good. The staff was nice and friendly but the service left a lot to be desired. We were a group of 15 sitting across 3 tables and they mixed up the orders for dishes in different tables. But what really put us off was the extra Rs. 600 service charge, in addition to the normal taxes. That really left a bad taste in the mouth!

Place is awesome with amazing terrace view over entire south Kolkata. Music is too loud and uninteresting. Quality of food is good, not so variety in drinks though. Service is better than most of the pubs. Not a good place for dating, but excellent place to hangout with a large group of friends..!!!!

The place has been on my wishlist for quite a few months. It's perhaps the coolest place to hangout in and around the Golpark locality. I loved the rooftop and Jacuzzi over there, out in the open air. I dropped in during the Pujo and quite obviously it was jam-packed. You may feel a li'l clumsy and claustrophobic in the indoor. But the rooftop is amazing. Things are little overpriced mayb in comparison to average pubs across the city. I mean, i dropped in with a friend, though we ordered plenty of beers and a few starters to go with, the bill came around 6.5k. The starters are good, not that extra ordinary though. The mayonnaise, the spicy pepper chicken was not that yummy. Another negative thing is that, they don't have happy hours like Irish house or Xrong place.
But still, this place is unique in its own way and it deserves a visit.

The Staff  is very friendly.. the Service is a bit slow though but worth the wait as time passes by.

This is the best bar cum restaurant in town. The atmosphere here is truly great. The ambience is what makes this place number one on my list. The view from the terrace is great. Jacuzzis are great. Most of the things are great about this. Would surely recommend. Only one negative point is that the taxes are too high which is not included in the price.

Except the table under the stairs everything was great about this place.. the Club sandwiches were filling, the chicken popcorn was average.. the chicken sizzlers was awesome.. the mocktails were also to die for.. the blue lagoon and the lime mojito was awesome.. It was a really happening place with nice music and great ambience just dont get the table under the stairs.

I was with 3 frnds on 11th Oct. This place was crowded and we had to wait about half an hour to get a table. Somehow we managed to get a table below ta staircase, probably the worst table of the place.
But the place was good. A good place to hang out.
We took tequilas, 5 pint of budweiser and Heineken each along with 2 sisha, bluberry with spring qater base and Kolkata mint with red Bull base. For food we had chicken roulade and crispy chilli fish.
Nothing to talk bout beer and tequilas. Speaking of sisha, it was good and in one coal it did last for half an hour. Bluberry was the light one but Kolkata mint was strong as ordered by us. It was strong and nice.
Chicken roulade was really good but food became cold very fast and so it qas not tasting that good after sometime. But this dish can be tried. Chilli fish dry taste was good but the fish was not good. I expected some other fish. The preparation was good. Pocket pinch was 6321 which included a whooping tax of 1866/-!!! Nice place to hang out. Will visit again sometime.

I guess it's time to change my review after the latest visit. Since I live outside I dropped by this place after 4 months. I guess now it has become the hipster pub of this part of the town. But the response of the staff has changed drastically.  I guess a new floor manager has been appointed who is too full of himself. I doubted whether he is managing a pub or the nuclear missile codes. He was rude and too full of himself. They took 35mins to serve a tower of beer. This place might have peaked but if they continue like this it won't take long to come down

The only reason this place gets a 4 rating is because of the ambience. 4 seating areas to choose from. Cozy interior, jacuzzi type moat, outdoor terrace and a glass walled room in the sky. They don't have strong beers but bucket is a good option. Food is not good at all. Tried Kung Pao Fish where the coating was hard and Crispy Chilli Chicken which was also quite not up to the mark.

One of the most happening places in kolkata vd a rooftop jacuzzi and ambience. Went there during durga puja.. Lovely place to chill with your fiance/friends over food and drinks. The lovely top floor view.. The lush green rooftop with jacuzzi .. The music adds to the charm of the place. I wasnot lucky enough to sit @ the rooftop bcz that day it was raining but we enjoyed a lot inside sitting, chatting vd friends over food , drinks.. We had schezwan noodles and chicken 65.. This is the first time i tried hookah , apple and mint flavour.. It was totally worth it.. Spicy food with beer and hookah and the awesome ambience out there made us feel out of the world..!! Will surely visit again for the rooftop experience.. Photos cannot make u feel the charm of the place.. This requires a must visit for all who are looking for a nice cafe cum bar with great ambience.

Lovely place with the most attracted 'rooftop sitting'.
And the most enjoyable sitting we had in a small pool wala thing where we dipped our legs there was a table in between where foods were kept..
It was great n we loved it.
N the foods- pesto pizza,fresh lime soda,cold coffee with ice cream were like cherry on the cake..
Too good :-)

I've been here for 3 times but this time I am disappointed with the service n billing system. They've just stole money from us like anything. I ordered Budweiser Larger but they told their stock got finished, so got agreed with Carlsberg bucket printed price @750Rs but when billed it amounted to 989Rs inc taxes. As far as I know, I'm not supposed to give any taxes other than service tax @14.5% of 750Rs. You're charging total tax of 239Rs. You think thats a joke? I recommend not to go to this place ever. I think I rated you much high.

Back home for Durga puja , went to this place on a friend's recommendation to keep post pujo depression at bay ! And little did I know Calcutta has come up with so many amazing places !!!
The rooftop , the view overlooking Southern avenue and so on and so far , the blue lights and the decor , everything is visually very very appealing !
Didn't order much yesterday, it was just Irish lemony and minced meat lasagne and both were good , I particularly loved the mocktail !!!
This place is a must visit if you are looking for ambience , a must must visit !
Cheers !

Since I visited this place on a dry day my review is solely based on the food, mocktails and hookah that they serve.
The variation of hookahs looked good and 'Calcutta mint something' that the waiter suggest on red bull base was smooth. But in any shisha/hookah bar there are attendants who checks the coal, however here we had to point out when it was burning low!!
Food is good and the mocktails is just okay. Expect some more variations next time.
In a hot, humid place like kolkata, the outdoor sitting area must have some some coolers/fans, which they never bothered to keep!!

I heard from quite a number of people that the food here wasn't upto the mark. Anyways, I decided to visit, giving in to my fascination of rooftop themes. I don't know whether it was the amazing night view or my low expectation but, my taste buds were happy with every bite I had. We had the Schezwan Noodles and the Veg Club Sandwich. Both of which ample in amount and flavours. Ofcourse you can't expect a proper dining experience given that it is not of those restaurants where you just rush in for the food. The ambience is peaceful because of the music and the untimed breeze. The only thing that bothered me was while we were being escorted to our table, I enquired if we could be seated in the topmost area. The waiter told me that the section is closed. But then, I see other customers being seated there. Not just one, atleast 4-5 groups. 'Bothered' would be an understatement. It was downright offensive. And hence, the rating.

This was the first time I ever visited this place. Loved the ambience especially the outdoor seating and the experience of dipping your feet in the jacuzzi. During this festive season it had a very vibrant culmination of dhaak and DJ which on its own was a different feeling altogether. Shisha was really well made, the fries we ordered were a bit dull. However to surmise it was a brilliant experience here. Next time I would be more into trying their wide variety of dishes than just gulping onto their alcohol buckets.

One of a kind pub cum lounge in Kolkata. Loved the concept, ambiance, music, service and of course food. Everything was perfect on a super crowded Durga Ashtami night. I will remember the hospitality by the staff for a long time. Special attraction is the mini pool where you can actually dip your feet and enjoy pubbing. Must try: Pasta in pesto sauce.

I have been planning to go to this place for a year now and finally got a chance to visit. The first thing you notice while entering is that narrow entrance. But the once you enter, i felt its the ultimate place to chill out with friends and catch up. Got a place in the rooftop and have to admit the view is mesmerising. Kolkata looks exquisite after dark. The view in itself makes the whole experience worth every penny. The quality is good, service is prompt and one will love the total package. Will definitely visit again soon.

The trending topic in Kolkata among the youth right now following the festive mood. This place offers a great lounge experience and the EDM Playlist tops all. You'll really get premium lounge feel once you enter this place a bit congested though in the inside but the roof top is what you should opt for plus the jacuzzi. Taquilla shots : a must. 
Place : Probably 1km away from Kalighat Metro towards southern Avenue, can take a Uber or public transport (which ever available). 
Food : We have ordered chicken salt and pepper, nachos platter and French fries. The food was good plus the plating was premium. The chicken could have been a bit tender though. 
Beverages and shisha : 2 buckets of burdweiser pint with Apple flavored icy mint base shisha and ended the show with a shot o Taquilla. Tremendously amazing. 
Ambiance : Awesome!! No matter if you are inside or on the rooftop you're bound to get a great feeling. That view from the rooftop is a plus. 
Service : Well here they might require some improvements but overall mediocre service, sometimes you have to wait prolonged for your already placed order. 
Overall : Well the rating says it all. I can vouch for this place if you want to have a good time boozing with your friends. Sorry I don't have pictures to share as I was more interested in getting wasted that day. :P

It was heavily crowded because of the puja fever. We had to wait for an hour and half to get our seats. But the ambience is to a different level. We were lucky enough to sit with our legs dipped in water. Coming to the food, we ordered meat lovers pizza and Hawaiian pizza . The food was decent. One thing bad about this place is somehow they do not have a provision for customers to sit while they are waiting. The ambience deserves full points but service needs to be worked upon

The food is really very tasty and the hookha is also fine. The staff is super friendly and service is pretty good too. 
Only one thing that did bother me , is the location since I am not very familiar with this part of the city... 😞
Last but not least which makes this place even more beautiful is the city view . It surely makes me fall in love with my city all over again ❤️

One of the cosy and upcoming lounge bars in Kolkata is none other than this one. Located in an upscale and posh Southern Avenue locality, the entrance hardly does justice to what is inside... a breathtaking open air sitting place, a cute pool for you to soak you feet and a hip crowd to go with it. Me and my girl gang of six went there when the Oktoberfest was in full swing. Consequently, the place was a bit crowded - but happening nevertheless. We ordered sip and bite where the latter had  Hawaiian Pizza, Crispy Chilly Chicken and Chicken Popcorn. The food was great and the prices justified considering it is a lounge bar. In fact, this is the perfect place to organise private parties as well. Thumbs up to them!

Southern Avenue is that corner of Calcutta where u can actually find chain of  classy cafe's & lounges. Among them,What's up is one such. Isn't that spacious but i would really appreciate how well they have made use of the space. They have outdoor seating where u can find Jacuzzi pool,indoor and even a private section. Interiors,no doubt is seraphic and classy. 
Coming to food,
Tried Risotto and it was very well prepared. It was filling and had perfect blend of cheese and spices.
Mushroom balls were again a hit on the menu. It was crisp and the green chutney inside that ball just blew my taste buds. The combination was so good. Along with it they serve jalapeno sauce which totally goes with the dish.
What I didn't like about the place was service. May be due to Pujas rush,they couldn't really handle well.
service was slow and we literally had to remind them from time to time about the grub which we ordered. 
Overall,it was really a good experience and really a cool place to chill out with buddies.

The food here reminds me of the LAYS tagline - "Ek baar khaoge toh khaate reh jaoge, No one can eat just one" . HOOKAH, DRINKS and BREEZE with LOUD MUSIC - PARTY ON....and if you get JACCUZI - the feel is like icing on the cake. The place is easy to locate and SPECIAL mention about the SERVICE- MAKES YOU FEEL AT HOME. Hit the place and Enjoy ur DAY. :)

This is one place where the people serving us made our night! Although the place is not big, the ambiance was intoxicating enough. Lovely music, delicious chicken and fish dishes, and Shabbir's sheesha were beyond our expectations. Three of us visited the place for the first time, and it just won our hearts. Highly recommended if you want to meet a host of cordial waiters, chill out and chat sitting on the terrace and want to be enthralled by the city skyline.

Lesser than even a below average experience. First thing first- they served my Cosmopolitan in a WINE GLASS( Turn off), second thing they asked if we 'need' glass for the beer, without letting us check the temperature of the same. When we asked by ourselves for a colder beer, they said they dint have so. Next, the accompanying nuts that they served was in a plate and not a bowl..almost falling every second. We wanted some side dish of fish, which wasn't in the menu but they assured us we are in for a great surprise. Surprise indeed for the crispy chilly fish that they served, was hotter than ever with what tasted like pizza chilly flakes. Though it was better than the cosmo which tasted more like sugar syrup ( and believe me I'm an ardent lover of Cosmopolitan, so I quite know how it tastes) we settled for it. However, serving a dry dish like that too, they forgot us to provide knives which was only brought when we requested for the same. That's not all- I WANT TO BRING THIS TO LIGHT THAT THE FISH CAUSED ME STOMACH ACHE TONIGHT AFTER HAVING IT IN THE EVENING TODAY. Dont know what could get worse. Oh yes, I guess the music could. Too loud music for such a small place. Finally the last and the biggest turn off would be the hookah smoke all over. There is no separate coop for the hookah, insensitive to the fact that many may not prefer it's smell. Over all, sorry but a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Id spare them the complainant of their charges though...which are overly exorbitant. So if you are planning to visit this place, make sure you carry your antacids with you gourmets.

Worst place to visit in Kolkata. We ordered 2 hookahs none of them were good, even after complaining numerous times it was same. The service was worst than third class. Such a pathetic place . How can places like this exist even ! They should immediately shut down.

Pizza is really good but we order hookah as well which was really bad! It started choking within 10 mins. Complaint many times, after sometime they somehow rectified and again the same thing happened after few puff. Overall recommended for nice evening with friends or loved ones. Go if you want to enjoy the ambience with some light food and drinks.

The place is next to the well known Indthalia restaurant on the 6th floor on southern Avenue. We ordered Chicken Caesar salad, chicken Lat Me Kai, crispy chilly baby corn for our veggie friend and beer off course. They have got this nifty bucket with 5 pints at reasonable rates. Food was good. Decor is good, nice ambience but I loved the basin in the washroom. Thumbs up and recommended for an afternoon chill out session with friends. Oh and they have hookahs as well. We had the 'X in Dubai'. Me likes...;)

We went there to get Jacuzzi table but as it was Saturday eve we cudnt get it.. they don't take bookings on Saturdays.. though ambience of the place is good, I personally found the place very congested..All the tables are very close to each other.. mocktails were good according to the price. We ordered crispy chilly chicken which wasn't crispy at all. Schezwan noodles were good but pretty spicy..food was not worth the price.

I absolutely loved this place for more than one reason. Its an amazing place to hang out, and its unbelievable how you don't even realise that you have spent so much of your time gazing at the setting rays of the sun. The highlight was the Jacuzzi, dipping my feet into soothing warm water works like a therapy for me, this was so much relaxing. Food and drinks were decent and not exactly expensive. Last but not the least the management skills these guys have is to take note of. Since a cozy space, weekends can get a little packed, but these guys handle every situation with elan, making space for everyone! Atleast I was pretty impressed. :)

This is the first time I've been there, and spent a plenty of time. I must say time well spent. Whiskey, and beer were accompanied our order list along with crispy chicken and another chicken item that I couldn't remember name. Although overall experience was good due to roof-top view and moonlight, but somewhere somewhat was missing, I personally feel it's not at all a classy place. Beer bucket were served in a very poor manner, nobody bothers shouting around, whiskey server without ice and water, I don't like beer that much rather I prefer whiskey and my 2nd peg came after 4 time repeat asking. Hookah smells like weed when we faced some random guys having sitting beside, after complaining the stuff incharge said "what can we do it hookah smells like weed?", the person wasn't bothered to check with those guys after confirming the smell.

So it was amazing experience that I can't put a good rating for this bar.

1. Poor service - (-1)
2. Poor behavior - (-1)
3. Serving system - (-1)

1. Good decoration - (+1)
2. Nice theme - (+1)
3. Pool table - (+0.5)

I was here last month. The ambience was good  but the music was not so great. The rooftop is not always available. We were refused alcohol as we were not carrying our Id's. So if you are planning to go there any soon , make sure you carry your Id. When we asked the manager if I could show some alternate Id proofs , he said that I looked too innocent. It was embarrassing , but my same aged friend was served with alcohol. Food is good. All the waiters are awsome . I was extremely dissatisfied by the manager's behaviour.

Thanks to What's Up, I got to see a lil piece of Oktoberfest right here in the city of Joy! Ambiance Relaxed and Superb but if the Music would have been a bit low, conversations would have been easier but no complaints. Food was good. We ordered Chicken Popcorn with Mayo dip, dry chilli chicken and Hawaian Thin Crust Pizza over breezer and Smirnoff. Crowd was superb with the Dj playing in the background. Staff behaviour was Amazing. And above all..the jacuzzi and the view of South Kolkata was awesome. If not for anything else go to this place for the beautiful view of South Kolkata. Loved this place..

If you manage to find your table in the outer arena then this place is bliss specially when you visit close to sunset.
The ambiance is the place it grabs the points. With the jacuzzi for your happy feet time. What's up is really freaky cool. The décor really funky and chill.
For drinks I stuck to the Virginia Mojito and a chocolate smoothie.
Food was fine. They have a what's up special dish which is a mixture of noodles and fried rice with some sauce. It is really filling.
The blueberry cheesecake treated more like frozen yogurt. So that was disappointing.
Excellent staff service. Very cooperative and courteous. Awesome space to hangout with friends 😆

Went last Sunday with group of friends! First of all entering into this place is hustle. Some old century lift function here which won't take more than 3 person at a time and the lift is too slow and scary.  But when you hit inside you will definitely love the ambience. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangement. Inside you have wooden bar kind of feeling and outside you get these nice rooftop ambience with a special attraction of dining with your legs under water. We were lucky to get that table. Coming to food, we ordered American salt and pepper corn,crispy chilly chicken and mediterranean pizza. American corn was okay could have been more crispy and lacked that tingy taste. Crispy chilly chicken was nice but the best thing was pizza. It was really yummy! We order hookah too which was really bad! It started choking within 10mins. Complaint many times but somehow they rectified and again the same thing happened after few puff. On drinks we opted for Heineken beer bucket where they offer 5 beer in price of 4. 

Overall recommended for nice evening with friends or loved ones. Go if you want to enjoy the ambiance with  some light food and drinks.

Well for foodie lovers this is an amazing place to try out with the crispy chili chicken my favorite over there. all over a wonderful experience for the people who visit this place.

Ordered the Nachos, Pizza and Pasta and all three were fairly good. Ordered a mocktail too (im guessing it was blue lagoon.) Not one of the best places I have visited but surely one of the better places in the city.

One thing and one thing only: the ambience and the roof top view. If you go to this place for anything else you are probably making a fool of yourself.

The food here was terrible and so was the service; in fact I am pretty sure that the waiter serving us was high. When we ordered the chicken 65, he started saying..."ohh the 40 plus 25" in a derisive tone. I wouldn't have left a tip for him either but they charged a service charge on the bill itself. The prices are on the expensive side. ( but it's all right if you count the view and rooftop scene) Honestly, I found the experience of sitting with my feet dipped in water kind of weird. Yet I liked the idea as it was one of a kind in the city.

But take a way the ambience of this place and all you have is a an eatery with bad service and food. So, definitely a thumbs down to What's up!

Finally a place in Kolkata that has a Hauz-Khasy feeling! What's Up is a lovely hangout place right opposite the RS Lake. The rooftop setting is quaint and picturesque. There's a unique 'pool' table where one could dip their feet in water while dining (though we gave it a miss). 

Had a lovely bachelor's party for one of our friends. The staff was courteous and the food was quite nice. 

Definitely a must-come-back kinda place! Wish it was there when we were in college :)

Rooftops have an elegance to itself that can make any mediocre restaurant a cut above the rest. What's up charges a cover fees of RS.500 per person who wants to be seated outside. The water below the table (for the lack of a better reference) really needs to be maintained.

Amazing place on Southern Avenue. The rooftop area is a gem. Marvellous views from atop. However I couldn't have a place there as it was pre-booked for some party. The closed area wasn't bad either. I liked the chairs/sofas. For the interiors they seem to have used a lot of stuff from an automobile junkyard!!! 
Quality of food was good too. We had Chicken Crostini, Roasted Chicken with Nachos & some grilled chicken staff. Many items which their staff suggested didn't have a mention in the Menu surprisingly.... Hope to visit again soon.

This place is located on the 7th floor of a building in southern avenue.The ambiance is mind blowing with cool seating arrangements,awesome music and specially the roof-top jacuzzi set up.There are two separate rooms - since What's Up is a hookah lounge,if some people are uncomfortable with the smoke,they can go to the separate room.The decorations and the overall arrangement just stole our heart.

Coming to the food,among the starters we ordered spicy cheese fondue with chicken popcorn which simply is a bliss for cheese lovers.The cheese is a mixture of three varieties of cheese which is then blended with cream and served beautifully with chicken popcorns.This dish is a must try !! 
We ordered the meat lovers pizza which was good enough.All the pizzas here are thin crust pizzas which really gets a thumbs up from my side.

Among mocktails,we ordered blue lagoon which was awesome in one word !! It is a must try again !
In the main course,we took what's up noodles which had a very good quantity of noodles mixed with egg and chicken.It tasted really good.There was also a chicken side dish provided which was good enough but a bit spicy.

For the dessert,we had tiramisu in which they give a jar filled with cream and toppings and it is coffee flavoured.It was a delicious dessert and gave a happy ending to the meal.

Last but not the least,two of us tried hookah for the first time here.We took the bluetooth shisha with red bull base.It is a mild one as we are beginners in this 😂.The hookah was smooth enough and it was a good experience for us.We loved it and had a lot of fun with the smoke 😂😂.

The service offered was perfect.They cooperated and   made us feel comfortable for the whole time.Really satisfied with the service provided.

Overall,it was an amazing day spent at What's Up.It is the one of the best places to hangout with friends.Looking forward to visit it again very soon !!

It's located on Southern Avenue little before Gariahat more. A big gate next to inthalia.  Elevator can accomodate only 2 people at a time. 

It's beautiful place to sit in the evening. Nice view. Only if you are lucky enough to get a seat outside. 

After the 3rd visit it seemed they are not being able to maintain the quality they use to have at the beginning. Been here in the first week when it had started. 
Coffee were good and so was the food. But last visit it didn't seem to be the same. 
Hopefully the quality of taste is maintained as before.

Three of us, old friends, decided to meet, in the middle of the week. Conveniently located, we trooped to this place, a terrace converted into a hookah bar complete with a roof-top little tub to dip one's feet in, and probably watch the sun set over Dhakuria lake. First of, the place was teeming with teenagers and the like, smoke coming out of their nostrils. Not a pleasant sight. The waiters are well-trained to deal with the young crowd, polite, yet firm, we appreciated their manner. The cocktails and finger-food was good. Fish and chicken mixes and wraps. Noisy and full of psychedelic lights, the cafe has its charms, but I guess we are way too staid for the MTV style crowd and specially with recent horrific trends with out-of-control teenagers and with children that age, cannot really appreciate this sort of milieu. Not our cup of tea, unless we are in a big group of 40 somethings- in which case, the place would complement the work-worn us in company of friends. I do recommend it, but with caution. The waiters, we found were asking some kids for their IDs, which is good. The open terrace, though may be be used with caution with too many volatile teenagers around, restraint and slight repression may be in order.

Atmosphere is mind blowing.
I have tried spinach and sweet corn cannelloni with garlic bread, crispy chilli babycorn, pesto thin crust 10 inches pizza, arrabiata sauce pasta and it was perfecto.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
Hookah plz try grape with ice base.
Beer bucket is less costly.
You have a place where you can dip your feets in bubbled water and enjoy your food.
A must try.
Earth shattering good food.

Awesome ambience awesome experience awesome food. 5 star rated. Try the pool table in the rooftop. Ek number hai bhai!! We ordered Spinach N Seet Corn Cannelloni with Garlic Bread, Pesto Pizza, Crispy Babycorn Chilli and Mixed Sauce Arrabiata Pasta. All of the items were bloody delicious. Cannelloni perfectly cooked, with good stuffing and it just melts in the mouth. With the Garlic Bread it just levitates the taste. Pizza was a thin crust pizza, must say better than dominos. All the elements of the toppings were perfectly cooked, generous amount of cheese and crispy pizza base what more do you need for the perfect pizza. The pasta was average. It had a good amount of veggies. Babycorn capsicum mushroom onions broccoli. It was a bit low on taste profile. But it was not that bad. Crispy babycorn chilli had the best sauce blend I have tasted. But need to work on making the babycorns a bit more crispy. It was a bit soggy. Still had a great taste. Sishas I would rate 7/10. For the price range its "Sahi hai yaar...!!". The ambience was too good. The inside had a more raw look. With brick walls and made from scrap metals. Outside is more of modern and contemporary style. Try the pool table (not the indoor game pool). Its awesome. Staff were very friendly and cooperative. We had a wonderful time there. Its a must must visit. Thank you What's Up we had a great time.

South kolkata much needed this kind of a classy bar cum cafe lounge like What's Up. Swanky ambience , cool music , open air section , jacuzzi , hookah , quality food and a fully operarional bar counter and the entire thing on the 7th floor with huge glass panes giving a vast view of the city , what's up mandatarily has everything for making your evenings extravangant. Two of us ordered for GRILLED CHICKEN IN RED WINE REDUCTION and WHATS UP NOODLES with a cocktail MARGARITA and few pegs of barcardi white rum and bacardi cranberry breezer. The food tasted very nice , and i loved my cocktail. The staff excelled in their work and very helpful in suggesting orders. The pocket pinch was tad high but i enjoyed the time thoroughly. Good done and keep up 👍

This is a place I visit quite frequently, primarily because the location is great and it's one of those few pubs where the ambience is cheerful and bright. The rooftop area is great, with a view over the treetops of Southern Avenue. The hookahs are decent, though I have had better. All in all, definitely a place you will go back to after your first visit.

Visited this very interesting restaurant cum bar in Kolkata. Quirky decor and cool ambience. On the terrace so has a decent city view. The amazing thing is the jacuzzi table where one can sit with their feet in the water, while dining. I tried the spinach cannelloni which was pretty tasty.

This place is located right at the heart of Southern Avenue .You may have a little trouble while locating the lift to reach your destination,but once you're there,the ambiance would settle you down.What they basically have is 2 medium sized rooms and a small rooftop which has seating arrangements as well as a mini pool having Jacuzzi. Been there twice and had the chance to enjoy jacuzzi on the second attempt.Generally,its crowded on weekends.

Ambience :-The ambience on the inside is cool and comfortable,but if you really wanna enjoy and its not an extremely hot day,you would definitely want to sit on the rooftop.It offers a very good view of South Kolkata and being on the 6 th floor,is generally quite breezy to get you in the mood.The service is good with a healthy waiter to customer ratio and the manager himself takes feedback on an occasional basis.

Drinks & Hookah :- Beers are low on variety and thats probably a bad thing in the summer season.Only 3-4 brands are available and I faced it during both my visits.Thankfully though,they have Bira Whites.Tried it for the first time and liked it pretty much.On the other hand though, the variety on hookahs is probably the best in the city. Plenty of basic flavors available,and lots of customization and mixing is in place to give a wide array of choices for the hookah base.

Food:- Didn't really taste many dishes here.But the Caesar salad is very delicious.The dressing is probably homemade which is even better and the quantity was really huge ,good enough to fill two stomachs for an afternoon snack.We also ordered Meat Lovers' thin crust pizza.The chicken quality was good,but the base could have been a bit more crunchier and it wasn't cheesy enough like a pizza generally should be,which affected its softness to an extent.Didn't try any other food dishes,so thats some inspiration to visit this place again.

Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends in the afternoon.Considering the location,its not much of a pinch in the pocket unless they charge you for the jacuzzi(for which they have a strange policy where they sometimes do charge and sometimes do not).A must visit for rooftop and hookah lovers.

What's Up was in my wishlist for a long time. Today I finally managed to go there. As it was raining heavily, we could not avail the rooftop facility. But the indoor seating arrangement was quite good. The staff was very courteous and this is something I would particularly like to mention. We had beer, breezer and appetizers. We ordered 1) French Fries 2) Roasted chicken nachos 3) Chicken popcorn with spicy cheese fondue and 4) Chicken Roulade. The food was tasty and served well. The spicy cheese fondue deserves a special mention because of its taste and the way it was served. We went to the rooftop to catch the view and Kolkata surely looks stunning from the height. 
Ambience: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5

Catchy name...Awesome reviews...attracted us to the What's Up cafe on Southern Avenue, next to Crave. The cafe is on the 7th floor. The interiors have been done up well but the indoor sitting area does give you a little stuffy feeling. However one feels uplifted by the beautiful outdoor sitting arrangement which includes a Jacuzzi with a table top where one can chill with their legs dipped in the water 👌. We had to settle indoors as we went for lunch and it was quite humid outdoors that day.
Coming to the food- We ordered Chicken Roulade/ Chicken Quesadilla/ Veg Mushroom corn Quesadilla for starters and then for Main course we ordered the Risotto Alapitoka/ Thai green curry/ Chicken Turkish boat pizza and a Veg Lasagne. The starters were good but both the Pizza and Veg Lasagne were not up to the mark (surprisingly they were reccomended by the staff). Presentation of food was good.
Full marks for the drinks and the service we got and for the lovely songs they played for us...including the birthday song when the Bday lady cut her cake.

Pocket pinch is on the higher side in regard to the food quality. Upgradation of quality of food and check on prices could make this Cafe a more inviting one👍

Good food, soothing view and a good ambience is all one needs on a weekend to relax. Risotto here is something one must not miss at. Mocktails are very refreshing and I'd love to try more dishes on their menu. 
The letdown of this place was cheesecake, to my surprise, which was a disaster. I suggest you not to go for it. 
Staffs are sweet and polite except one who was really behaving rude with people. I'd have mentioned who it was but missed out on his name. 
Give this place a try, you'll love it. :)

What's Up is a cafe cum bar on the 7th floor above Indthalia restaurant opposite to Nazrul Manch..Evening time in what's up is the best if you are able to get yourself a table in rooftop area...It is the best place in the city according to me,whether the music,ambience,food,hospitality everything makes this place to stand out of the rest..The best thing for this cafe is the entire view of lake area...Simply I am in love with this place....

A decent place which is buzzing with a young crowd. The only downside is that it is extremely congested but that also speaks for the popularity of the place. The open terrace was quit good and good was decent. Might not be making a trip there soon but would recommend if you have a lot of time to kill.

It was a weekday evening and a sudden plan. A unplanned meet caused me to hop in to this place. Located in Southern Avenue, situated in the top of a building, one can witness the majority of South Calcutta while taking a sip or having a bite. 
The place has an outdoor seating on the rooftop, and two comartments that provide cozy indoor seating facility. 
Theboutdoor seating has a very unique thing you get the chance to dip ur legs in water while u chill, thats the best part of this place, but for availing that u need to be lucky enough. Rest are high chairs which are a bit uncomfortable. But thr reason for putting such high chairs is, so that you can witness the serenity and greenery of the safari park on one side and the high rise ci crete towers on the other side. 
Go for hookahs and preferably cocktails, the food is not that great. The ambience is a bit heavy and loud. You have dj mixes playing, lcd screens, flouroscent lights...! 
You want to chill, party, hangout....this is the olace to be. The only concern can be the pocket pinch. Considering the ambience, location and services you get, you cant really complain about it....!!

Visited this place on a Friday night and I must say , was super impressed with everything ! We sat on the terrrace which gives a real trippy view of the city. Clear skies and a cool breeze made it feel heavenly. We ordered Chilli Chicken , Babycorn , a Mediterranean Veg Pizza and a couple of whiskies. Everything was served promptly and smokin' hot! But honestly , the best thing about this place is the view and atmosphere. Definitely going to spend the winter evenings here. Superb Place !!

P.S : Was pleasantly surprised by the low rates :)

I just had my birthday party with my friends there...the ambience is nice ....its on the rooftop of the building...it has an indoor place which is nice there's also the rooftop terrace with small tables where the famed jacuzzi tables are placed....its a real pity that we didn't get them cause they told us that we have reserve it from before so we sat at the table on the terrace ...anyways the view is really really nice with music playing...we went on a Saturday evening so it was really packed up....the service was good ...the food was average...we ordered couple of sisha which was surprisingly long lasting given we were on that all that time...the chicken 65 we ordered were not upto the mark as well as the nachos which was kind of so-so...but what we love was the Pizzas....the meat lover thin crust pizza tasted good but you should really put a little more meat in it to justify the name...the place is a little bit on the pricey side...if you want to experience a little different place with friends then this is the place to go...I am going again next week...fingers crossed I will get the jacuzzi table 😊

As the name says,u might confuse it with the social networking platform,whatsapp!(which i thought it to be in the first place when i heard about it).
I went there a few days back with my school buds,which is in the 6th floor of the building!
Okay now first thing first-I would say this is the best hookah place i had ever been to...with its ambience being the best part till now for me!
I loved almost and everything about this place be it food or the other(both quality and quantity),especially the roof top terrace with jacuzzi(their main attraction)..as it was raining so it was unavailable at that time but somehow we managed to click some selfies :P !
As we were there for the hookah only so we ordered X in Dubai which is to me the best flavour with perfect base i had so far.
What i liked is,it being smooth and didn't choke,which troubled me previously for quite some time to other hookah place..whatever it was,it totally exaggerated me!
And being a pocket friendly i would recommend all to pay a visit!
Would be visiting soon till then keep creating wowness! 🍻

What's Up is one such place where your Sunday evening gossip will never be boring. The four of Us could easily locate the place. As usual seating was not available on a Sunday evening but our wait was worthy. We really appreciate the courteous staff and the smooth arrival of food after order. The rocking ambience, the decor and specially the open area is mind blowing. 
Quality & quantity of food makes a restaurant memorable  hence I must mention about the quantity. Quantity of Chicken Roulade & the special Bhetki dish wasn't worth at all of the price they charge. Meat Lovers Pizza tasted really good. No complain for the Beer bucket but yes a small cup of Cafe-Latte will charge you Rs. 100! 
Kolkata is indeed growing with a cafe like What's Up :)

Beer at decent prices, terrace seating, prompt service, attentive and courteous staff and some of the best hookahs I have tasted (Try the Smoke Mojito and Teen Paan Flavour) though I didn’t find Indian Whisky on their menu. We were a group of ten stags on a weekend and yet they accommodated us. Worth a second visit.

Checked out this place on Southern Avenue yesterday and I must say its worth trying. First, I really appreciate the hospitality shown by the staff and the managers at What's up. We tried out their outdoor seating which has the jacuzzi and it was formidable.The waiter who served us was prescient in recommending their signature drinks and educating us with the promotional offers going on. His boss visited our table twice to check whether everything was okay. It really feels great in receiving this kind of hospitality and service which is  missing in majority of the places.Coming to food and drinks, they are above average but surely can be improved. We tried scotch along their Cajun style chicken and crispy babycorn which were good. If you don't want to try alcohol, i I recommend trying their mocktail Kiwi Mojito which was impressive.
Overall it was a pleasant experience for someone like me who came to Kolkata after a gap of around 4 years and I would definitely recommend this place either for a casual date (definitely try the jacuzzi) or simply hanging out with friends.

We went to what's up code on the occasion of eid, and I must say that we enjoyed it a lot. We took the outdoor terrace sitting and ordered for the Al Siqandri Hookah, which is basically double apple with mint, in a water base. The hookah was smooth and nice. They do offer the first coal change for free. Next we ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio, which is a pasta without a cream base, only tossed with herbs in olive oil, and I must say it was well made. We also ordered spicy cheese fondue with chicken popcorn. The fondue was really lip smacking. 
We also ordered Cajun spiced chicken, which was not great , but good for a try (I have had better Cajun fried chicken).
We wanted to order liquor, but the fact that it was a dry day totally skipped our mind :(
Instead, we ordered a mocha frappe, two fresh lime soda, sweet and salty, one virgin Mojito, one cafe latte and one KitKat shake. 
The drinks were pretty good, except the last fresh lime soda which was so bad that we kept sending it back for three times until try made it perfect. It was a good experience, ans thankfully it did not rain, so we enjoyed sitting in the open terrace. Place is a little overpriced, if you consider the taste and quantity in the food.
Pocket pinch : 2/5 :(

Been there yesterday with my girlfriend. Place was easy to locate as I stay nearby itself...located on the topmost floor. You need to take the lift (the one over there is exclusively for the restaurant's guests so that was nice...but only 3-4 people can get in at a time so had to wait for our turn). The ambience was beautiful with custom lanterns n switches which reminded of childhood days. The place was already occupied so we had to wait for our turn. We had to keep standing and wait but we did not mind as the view outside was quite pleasing from the big glasses. We ordered the grape mint shisha which was good enough. We also ordered fresh lime sweet which was just okay. The service was quick and the staff was good. The babycorn was very nice and the pizza could have been a bit better. The tables for two were quite small though. Overall I enjoyed my two hours fully with some great music and ambience!!

I went with my bestie to this place a few days back on a Saturday evening. It was cloudy and rainy, a visual treat from the glass walls of this place. We tried their mocktails and salt and pepper corn that turned out to be quite good. May be they should try making better piña colada. Well I am still happy with my overall experience.

A friend of mine took me to this cafe last Tuesday evening. Right from the moment we entered the cafe, we felt a positive vibe in the air. The staff were polite and cordial. The outdoor seating capacity was full, so we sat inside. My friend knew a staff there who happens to also play state level cricket. We ordered Grape Mint Shisha and a Hawaiian Pizza. The thin crust pizza was perfect and the Hookah was no doubt good. Afzal, the staff member I was talking about showed us some tricks with fire and alcohol in the bar and entertained us to the fullest. He shared personal experiences from which we came to know about his dedication to What's Up Cafe. Wish that he becomes a celebrity bartender soon. Will be visiting this cafe again. 

P.S The cafe is always packed with cool people, so make reservations before visiting the place.

Went today for the first time. The ambience was too good. The open terrace was very good. But considering the ambience the food wasn't that good. We ordered for crispy chilli chicken, chicken 65 with a twist, cajun spiced chicken and a chicken emmensea.  Chicken emmensea was totally a waste of money. The other items was average. Hookah was not even that good. This place is only preferable for its ambience.

The ambience is great. It's on the 7th floor and you get a lovely view of Kolkata from the terrace. We ordered a Ceasar salad which had  few chicken pieces and lots of lettuce. The Chicken Roulade was great though. I would like to suggest the waiters to note down the orders in a notepad rather than trying to memorize the entire order and get confused. Also while serving you should serve the drinks together and not like serve 2 persons first and then serve the 3rd person after 10 mins. Overall a good place to hang out. I went there on a dry day so can't comment on the alcoholic drinks though.

This is one of the very few places which serve nice shisha good food and drinks. And yes you cannot forget their rooftop section. The interiors are done up really well lighting is perfect shisha is usually quite good food isn't disappointing what they can work on is service otherwise this is a great place to chill after work.

The cafe is situated at Southern avenue near the Bijolee Grill shop. It can be a little hard to find. The interior is excellent, specially the open terrace tables and the pool side table. Now, coming to the food, had Meat lovers pizza and tuborg beer and old monk. The pizza was tasty. They served quickly too. And for dessert, had Sizzling Brownie which was amazing. Overall had a wonderful experience. The staffs were nice and friendly. Would recommend to all. Will be visiting again soon.

One of the most favourite place of mine for hangout with friends...I love almost everything about this place..Their main attraction is the open terrace with a Jacuzzi with blue waters running all over your feet...I really love ❤ this seating arrangement of this cafe a lot...The inside seating arrangement is also nice...U get to see a beautiful view of the adjacent Southern Avenue...
Food...
We had ordered a lot of food items as we went there for lunch and we were very hungry 😋...All the food items were well decorated and delicious 😋..
We had ordered
Crispy chilly chicken...Non..veg club sandwich with French fries and coleslaw...chicken roulede...Meat lovers pizza...lime soda and above all Hookah...
I went there for two times and both the days I had a gala time..
To end of...

I'm not much of a nightlife guy, but our group of 4 decided to try one of the rather hip places. What's Up was almost immediately decided upon and we flocked there without much second thought.

The location of the place is amazing. With outdoor seating on the roof, this place is a favorite during summers. And they have a jacuzzi. Yes. Even though it's mostly occupied, it's a great addition. More of those wouldn't hurt.

Coming to the food, what I gathered soon after arriving is that it was mainly suitable for a night of drinking and hookah. We ordered a couple of cocktails which were pretty amazing. We took the meat lovers' pizza, roasted chicken tacos, and brownie with ice cream for dessert. The food tasted very good and no complaints there.

The price is a little too high but worth the atmosphere the place offers. Would not recommend if you're a headstrong non smoker/drinker.

After seeing the rooftop view pictures, I went to visit this place. But the place wasn't as spacious as it seemed in the pictures. The rooftop was pretty small and when I had gone there, it was pretty crowded. So I had to sit indoors. Coming to the food, this place serves excellent food. The food which I'll never forget is the sizzling brownie. It was exquisite! The staffs are welcoming. And above all the quality of the food is very good. Must visit for food lovers. ♡

Been there just once. It is pretty easy to locate. It's  a nice place where there are different areas of setting. On a pleasant evening outdoor seating is the best option though it does get a little crammed if there is a lot of crowd. 
The day I went I got Bira and nothing made me more happy. Was having a bad day, and when the guy announced they have bira I was the happiest soul there. 
Well haven't tried anything else there so can't comment on it.   But the fact that I got bira there made this place got up in my list of hangouts. Yay!

What's Up Cafe has a certain flair to it. Located 6 floors upwards on Southern Avenue, this hyperactive joint does very well to provide an exciting time.

Their service is as standard as it gets, much is left to be desired. We did come to this place when it was bordering on full, so we caught the crowd. What's Up cafe did impress with crowd management and crowd control.

It's not an inexpensive cafe by any means. But, at the end of your meal it may seem very worth it. I only managed to sample their cheese maggi, which I'll be honest, is quite the little dish! It's not hard to make, but it's a very good accompaniment for a bucket o' beer.

The place is also very well made. Their interiors are stunning, which a couple tables demanding a pool of water to be sat on. Try and not wear tight trousers/jeans!

Visiting this place for the first time with my friends cum colleagues. Located on the rooftop, the setting was a nice one with music playing in the background although the recorded music was soon replaced by a group of customers who had in their midst a talented musician who started playing his guitar and singing which really set the tone for the night. Food was good. We were the last lot to leave the place and the Management really went out of their way to keep the place open and cater to all our needs. Desserts were on the house which was a nice touch. Would love to visit the place again. Special mention to Afzal who stayed beyond his normal working hours to ensure that he catered to all of our needs. Cheers.

A totally Fantabulous place specially if you get to sit in the Jacuzzi Area!! The place has got both Indoor and Outdoor seating areas. Set quite high on a roooftop surrounded by greenery all around, the blue sky above, pretty yellow flowers along the edges, a swing chair in the corner, the Outdoor Area is just awesome!!! The main attraction is the Jacuzzi...!! Sitting on the edge of the Jacuzzi with your legs dipped in warm rushing water around your choice of delicasies with your group of friends....it's just the perfect way to chill out with your buddies!! What else do you want on a lazy Sunday afternoon??
The ambience is pretty good and they play the perfect music. I actually got too happy when they started playing my most favorite tracks as soon as I entered the place....what a coincidence!!! Everything I Do, Careless Whisper....OMG!!!! Such a sober playlist they have got!!!
Coming to food now. Well, we had ordered Nachos, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Mixed Sauce Pasta, Pesto Pizza, Maggi, Chinese Bhel, Haka Noodles, Veg Manchurian, Fresh Lime Soda and a couple of Sheeshas. Food was decent. I really liked the Pasta.
Overall, it's a superb place and it sure made my Sunday. Just the perfect place to hang out with your friends!!

Good interiors. Good food. Good service. Special attraction is the roof top which has a small pool like feature with tables. Which is very exciting. Remains a bit crowded so preferred to sit inside only. Good place altogether. The cold coffee was real good. And the hookah is neat. Good place for a group hangout.

We visited this place last evening. What we liked most about this place is the good music, nice setup on the roof top and the rustic interiors. What could have been better is the quality of pizza, saw many people eating them though. The entrees were extremely good. We had a prawn and a chicken dish. Slightly on the more expensive side compared to Xrong place and Spice Kraft.

Located in southern avenue just beside Indthalia, What's Up was not hard to locate. The cafe cum bar is on the 7th floor of the building. The interior of the cafe is pretty nice along with the outdoor with jaccuzzi and nice chairs and artificial grass. The view from the terrace is a cherry on the top. Talking about the food we ordered chicken nachos, veg mediterranean pizza, cappuccino, cheese cake, gum supari shisha and 2 tuborg. The food was quite decent. The hookah was nicely prepared. The service was nice too. But the pocket pinch is certainly on the heavier side. Overall a nice place to hangout.

The new 'it' place. 😛
Visited this cafe/lounge a couple of months back after hearing great reviews from friends. This place is located right beside the lake indithalia. The place was crowded on a weekday at around 4 in the evening so that's got to say something about it's popularity. It is mainly famous for its sisha. We had ordered 2 of them, a paan flavored with ice base and some other flavored one. The lady attending our table was sweet and made it a point to make us feel comfortable and provide us with whatever required immediately. In food and beverages we had ordered 3 coffees, chicken nachos and chicken lasagna. The food and coffee was just about okay. Nothing extraordinary. What draws the crowd here is mainly the ambiance. It's very prettily decorated like an interior of a ship. Beautifully lit and very comfortable seats. The washroom has a very interestingly done mirror( looks like a sunglass) There is also an outdoor seating area which is pretty but gets congested when there's a big crowd. A jacuzzi is there where one can dip their feet and chill. ( it's a little unhygienic for me). One can sit on one of the chairs of the outdoor seating area and sip beer while looking across the beautiful landscape visible from the rooftop.

With a lot of expectations I decided to spend an evening at What's Up but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The most worst experience I had so far at any restaurant. This probably is the first time I am giving a rating 1. Well to start to with this place is located at Southern Avenue on the 6th floor of an office building right beside Crave Foodworks. The entrance is quite colorful with a nice decor and seating arrangement. But it stops here. The staffs are very arrogant. We wanted to get an outside seating but we were denied(by the main manager) saying couples are not given the outside seating as it would hamper their business since outside seating is only for people in a group!! Okay we understand that it being a weekend there was heavy rush and hence they may have rejected us. We decided to adjust in the inside seating and enjoy the evening. But then the staffs were constantly pushing us to place our order immediately and dint let us take our time and decide what to order. Finally we placed our order - 1 Kiwi Mojito (Mocktail), 1 Mojito (Cocktail), 2 Budweiser, 1 Cajun Spiced Chicken and 1 Meat Lovers Pizza. Both the Mojitos tasted the same - the usual mojito that we get everywhere. Not even the slightest taste of Kiwi in the Mocktail or White Rum in the Cocktail. Cajun Spiced Chicken - the worst starter I had had anywhere. Even the small roadside stalls serves better starters. The chef should indeed check the recipe of Cajun Spiced Chicken and try making it again!! Sorry this aint Cajun Spiced Chicken- rather I should say it was a cheap saucy chicken preparation which tastes aweful! At last with lot of expectations we tried the pizza which again disappointed us. I had thought of trying the desserts but gave up my plan. The food quality or be it the drinks - nothing is good about this place. Its horrible!! What's Up seems quite promising but the staffs and chefs really need to do a lot better in every aspect else they would start losing promising customers. People won't visit if the service is not good. And I am not going to visit What's Up the second time just to waste my money without eating nothing drinking nothing satisfactory. This was the first time when we walked out of a restaurant empty stomach and return home and have dinner!!  People are welcome to come here to spend money just for nothing!!

The Decor of this place is interesting but the  service is a big let down.It was raining hence we had to sit inside and for people like me, who are not much of a hookah fan it gets pretty irritating , with all sorts of fragrances invading my space. The food was fair but the service was not upto the mark. specially when you are charging an extra service charge. Our food  wasn't even served to us. Also, while serving someone a kitkat shake , a dessert spoon should be provided with it.We received none. Having Said that, the only good thing about this joint is its positioning on the rooftop . Food quality and Price charged for it don't quite match.

The best thing about this place is the serene ambience...the perfect time to visit this place is evening around 5 pm on a cloudy windy day...
we wanted to sit at the tables with the arrangements for dipping ur legs in the water but those seats were reserved...nevertheless i liked our dining space...
the food was a big dissapointment...we had kitkat shake and mango shake which were good....
we took crispy chilli chicken and chicken roulade on their recommendation which was presented beautifully bt was very average in taste...
then we had chicken maggi in cheese sauce which was ordinary as well...d bill was exorbitant and did not justify the quality of food...anyways i would still like to visit this place again owing to its unique and splendid ambience

Located in Kolkata's official bhool-bhulaiya : Southern Avenue, What's Up was surprisingly easy to find, thanks mostly to a conspicuous (frankly, this is me just being mild, it was way more than just 'conspicuous') guitar placed at the entrance of a building in Keyatala. Also it helps that Fung Shway, Bijoli Grill and Fillers are adjacent to it. The cafe is on the 7th floor of the aforementioned building and has just one lift that can fit only 3 people at a time. So yes : not the most convenient of things to happen. The cafe in itself though is a rather beautiful thing. Both the outdoors, with their now signature jacuzzi and massage chairs coupled with the artificial grass floor, as well as the indoor cafe with neon lights and punk-ish printed sofa chairs, make this place stand out when it comes to design. And of course, if you are on the seventh floor on an open terrace or if the sides of the indoor cafe are made entirely out of glass : the view is bound to be good. Luckily the food perfectly complements the setting.

Bruschetta with button mushrooms and loads of mozzarella was a rather tasty dish with extra brownie points for the innovative plating. The screwdriver was the usual and while the Turkish chicken boat pizza was again another beautifully plated dish : taste wise it did feel a bit bland. Tiramisu is a hard dish to get wrong and an equally hard dish to get it perfect and here it was somewhere in between. The bill came at around 1350, so the price is slightly on the higher side.

 What's up, with its convenient location, could have ended up being  one of those gorgeous looking places depending just on their bar and the hookah, but fortunately for all involved it is a lot more than that.

This place is like a second home. Being a regular visitor is an added advantage for getting best of services. When it comes to rating this place, ambience is the clear winner.

There are arrangements of indoor sitting as well as rooftop sitting. The indoor sitting is comfortable and the walls are decorated with beautiful wall art. Plus there are plug points against every table (a big relief for someone whose phone is usually on low battery due to extensive use).

The main set back of the indoor sitting is the music, which is often too loud to make the ambience noisy. Plus too many people smoking hookah makes the space a bit stuffy during the rush hours.

The main attraction of this place is the rooftop sitting. Neatly carpeted floor with revolving chairs, chairs on wheels, swings, makes it a lovely hangout. Plus there is a little pool of water on the rooftop, where you may actually dip your legs and enjoy a beer or puff up a hookah.

Never had a complaint with the service, however few of my friends have otherwise experience, especially those who had visited on the days of special occasions.

Previously this place served alcohol only twice a week, however that problem has been resolved now and alcohol is available throughout the week. Not really a fan of hookahs, however the What's Up special hookah, rose and vanilla flavoured hookah are nice once a while.

The food and beverages are pretty decent and nicely customisable. Mojitos (both alcohol based and non alcoholic) are available in various flavours and each of them are distinctly different from each other. In fact most of the beverages are pretty yum. We had starters and quick bites, mostly, and they are all pretty delicious. Chicken nachos, spiced Cajun chicken, fried calamari, ceaser salad, chicken lasagna, chicken quesadilla, are the dishes that I love and recommend. The Thai curries are pretty good as well. The pizzas are different and I love their recipe; the meatlover's pizza, however, should have had more meat to justify it's identity. Not to forget the desserts, the sizzling brownie with ice cream is rich in texture and mouth watering. This place used to serve blueberry cheesecake in mason jars, which was one of the best cheesecakes in the city, however they have omitted that item from the menu and kiwi cheesecake available, which is a disaster. The base of the new cheesecake is too hard and biscuity, and smells of raw butter.

It is highly recommended that the kiwi cheesecake is removed from the menu and the blueberry cheesecake is re-introduced.

I was here for my birthday treat along with three of my close friends. We were bored of ordering the same dishes - Pasta or Pizza. So, this time, we thought of trying something new.

So we ordered a Chicken Lasagna for me and a friend and Vegetables Lasagna for our vegetarian friends.

The order came a bit late but they told us, it takes time, so we weren't really bothered.

Then the order came with two plates that had absolutely identical looking lasagna. Now it was my responsibility to make sure we had the non veg one so I asked the waiter 5 times before serving that make sure what you're serving me is the chicken one.

He was really confident.

It was my first time so I had no expectation of the taste. Whatever it was, tasted really good. The blend of cheese and vegetables.
Yep. Vegetables.
Took us some time to realize that our plate just had too much of vegetables. It was then when we tasted the supposedly 'Vegetable Lasagna' that I realized is shouting chicken to me.

My Jain friend had already finished half of it and absolutely cleared her plate.

We complained and they simply just said, it was a big blunder and offered us a complimentary dessert.

I understand it was a blunder and can not be erased by any complimentary dish but my only advice to the chef is try not to make the dish absolutely identical or put up some sign or flag that the dish is non veg. All he did was add few leaves extra in one of the dish to make it look different. But the entire thing failed due to miscommunication between the chef and the waiter perhaps. I wouldn't blame the waiter though. It was chefs duty to keep it distinct.

Anyway,
Ambiance : 4.0
Chicken Lasagna : 3.0
Vegetable Lasagna : 4.0
Brownie Ice cream : 4.5

Service : 3.0

We were searching for a cool place to chill out with drinks and finger food near Gariahat. What's up seemed to be the perfect destination after reading zomato reviews. We were expecting a mesmerizing ambience. After entering we walked from one end of the restaurant to the other to find a place that could fulfill our expectation. The
outdoor seating area was pleasant. But we could not sit there as it was drizzling. The indoor sitting area was rather cramped inspite of their effort to make the decor stylish and unique. But the view was still good from both the areas.

We ordered for fondue with spicy chicken popcorn and brushetta with tomato basil and buffalo mozzarella topping along with vodka and beer. The presentation was offcourse beautiful. But the taste was pretty ordinary.

Neither the food nor the ambience could meet our expectations. The bill came around 1700/ which was just not worth it.

What’s Up is a rather swanky joint on top of a building in Southern Avenue. Veering away from being just another watering hole, What’s Up offers some rather fun and unique experiences to those who seek something different. Therefore, a table which doubles up as a jacuzzi, and massage chairs where you can relax and have a drink. We, however, have picked a small table near the bar, and its crowded but still not so bad that you can’t stand there. Hookahs are served on the side, and the expert makers quickly assemble them on request, flavours ranging from the regular Teen Paan to the more unusual Mint and Tabasco.
                                                                ...

Excited with all the photo-shopped high resolution zomato uploaded photos, I was hoping to enter into a wide open beautiful place with a great view. The view was great of course, but the indoor space is so small that it felt stuffy even on a weekday evening with a few tables occupied and just about a single guest having hookah. The very idea of the place crowded and hazed with hookah is in itself very claustrophobic !

The outdoor seating was nicer, but since it was drizzling,

This is one of the coolest places that I've been to. With 3 types of seating arrangements, the one on the terrace with a pool in it, where one can dip their legs while enjoying food, is the most remarkable. The ambience, crowd and staff were all up to the mark..food was good. Hookah was too good. Definitely a great hang out spot...

Great place to hangout with friends. The proper balance of interior decor with open terrace decor is worth mentioning. They have a couple of special seats where you can actually dip your feet in water while take a sip from a drink. The food is quite good but a bit over pricey.

“What’s Up?” Well, quite a bit, as I figured in the hour that I spent there, last Sunday afternoon.

The name caught my eye a couple of months back, thanks to the unusual guitar-styled signage—optimal use of a congested vertical space, outshining every other signage around.

Incidentally, a friend’s younger sister raved so much about the place that I decided to venture up with a colleague for a latish (and quickish) working Sunday lunch.

The distinct Café Mondegar-inspired wall mural and assorted framed and wall-mounted vinyl graphics work towards leading you up from the 6th floor. It’s another matter that despite these visual aids,  I almost entered the kitchen because I couldn’t figure out which door to enter from! :P

Once in there, the place was languidly abuzz with the uplifting aroma of hookah—reminding me of a trip made eons ago to Kathmandu, Nepal. It also had to do with the velvet voice of Sanam Puri singing ‘Yeh Raatein Yeh Mausam’ on an overcast afternoon, and the view outside the tinted windows. I had been air-lifted.

The quirky red plumbing pipe lights, the Union Jack printed sofa-styled seats and the graphic LP-patterned tables all add a funky, yet cosy character to this place.

Hardly the adventurous sort (particularly when you’re ravenous and hesitant to try anything offbeat), we decided to settle for what seemed like a safe bet: Bruschetta Promodo and a Thai Green Curry with Steamed Rice, followed by a Tiramisu.

In about 15 minutes, we were pleasantly surprised. The sheer presentation demanded—as is the social ritual, that we capture these masterpieces on our smartphones, for FB timeline posterity.

The five roundish portions of Bruschetta were deliciously delicate, and the tomatoes were nice and taut! My friend requested for some balsamic vinegar, which turned up a tad late but surely (what’s)up’ped the taste quotient of the last two units.

By the time we opened the lid of the bamboo steamer with fresh steamed rice, the absolutely orgasmic lemon grass aroma had enticed our tastebuds! The rice was steamed to perfection with generous wads of crumpled lemon grass embedded.  The Thai Green Curry was as authentic as could be and both of us were delighted with the assortment of veggies, firm and fresh. We recognised the plump button mushrooms and broccoli flowerettes, but couldn’t really tell what the other veggies were. Well, they were nice only.

The crème of our experience was the can’t-really-go-wrong-with Tiramisu—described as Mascarpone, Baileys and Savourdi. It looked like a dream on the menu which almost came true when it arrived in a smart, stout bottle-jar. A small, but significant suggestion: a generous sprinkling of caramelized crunch ideally at the bottom would ensure I keep coming back to dig this, for sure!

Well, almost full marks to What’s Up for a memorable lunch, albeit spartan, when compared with what all we saw on the menu. But then, we had to leave ample room for whetting (and wetting) our appetite the next time, as also exploring uncharted zones of the place, like the outside rooftop area!

P.S. The guy who was mopping the floor was hardly discreet. He kept coming in and out of the kitchen service door with this over-sized stick (avoidable, considering he needn’t have gone in and out as often). Or perhaps, given his diminutive size, his mop stick should be scaled down.

Also I will never forget how a slightly over-bearing steward-type chap came up from behind and asked me to peer into the red mug that had the invoice slip. “There is some small surprise inside!” he grinned pointing to the Pulse candies that I had already spotted, but chose to ignore (as a bad idea). The tangy sharpness of Pulse’s kachha aam and aamchur would’ve simply ruined the uplifting after-taste of the Tiramisu.

I always felt South Kolkata always lacked a proper night out option and What's Up comes in to fill that void. This is an uber cool pub with multiple sections and an outdoor pool where you can dip your legs while enjoying a chilled beer...how cool is that???
Unfortunately, I happened to visit What's Up on a day when SRH were playing the RCB in the IPL 2016 finals. The pub was thickly packed and me and a friend of mine had to settle at the high stools. The room was small and stuffy honestly. Plus, they do not seem to have a separate non-smoking area. Since I dnt smoke, it was a bit claustrophobic for me. 
Service was lousy and the attendants came across as ill-informed. Anyway, coming to the good part. They run offers on drinks from time to time and you may grab a good deal of you are lucky enough. We wanted to have some tidbits with beer and ordered for a chicken Caesar salad, a plate of chicken nachos and chicken quesadilla. The chicken Caesar is the best Caesar I have had in Kolkata. The Caesar dressing was creamy (I hope ur was made by them and not bough off the market) with generous helpings of green and chicken. The croutons added the right amount of crunch to the salad. The portion size was more than enough for an average eater. 
The quesadilla was good. It was creamy and chest and the accompanying beans were great. The sour cream and mayo were good. However, the nachos were disappointing. The nachos were packed nachos available in the market. I was wishing that they make their own nachos, but alas. 
Pricing is decent. A meal for two with two rounds of beer set us back by 2100 INR.

I have always been a little averse to watering holes of Southern part of the city. In the wanderlust my friends and I decided to hit this inconspicuous joint in southern avenue and boy were we in for a surprise or what?!!! Impeccable decor, facilities to sit indoors as well as in the outdoor terrace, fantastically behaved staff and a jacuzzi to top it all.. This place has come as revelation to us. We ordered a chicken popcorn and the dip they gave is to die for. The only downside probably is lack of choices at the cocktail section. Also the terrace tends to get a bit crowded, but lack of space is not something new to this part of the city. If they can increase the choices this place will be my regular hunt for sure. South Calcutta definitely needed and deserved a place like this. Go visit it.

Cheers.

Location - Right beside Indthalia on Southern Avenue, located on the 6th floor.
This place needs no introduction. It has been my go to places for hookahs. I spend most of my Saturday evenings right here and the experience during each visit has been more than pleasant. Hookahs, are one of the best in towns. I found out the meat lovers pizza, equally good. Mocktails are equally good. Now to the USP of this place, "The Jacuzzi". Submerging your feet inside the water, you are bound to spend hours in there and the view from the terrace is equally breathtaking. Don't want to sit in the Jacuzzi or the terrace, they have got you equally covered up with two additional rooms. In short, you won't be disappointed. Staff is very well behaved and courteous enough.

Must haves - Crispy Dry Chilli Chicken, Virgin Mojito to name a few.

This place feels almost like OTT. They too have that basket chair. The best unique thing loved about this place is, they have two tables in water, u can literally put ur feets in water and sit. But for that u need to reserve it beforehand. Non terrace part of it was bit claustrophobic i felt. And minus points for depressing way up and entry to this place. U get shisha and alcohol n nice music. Funny thing is waiter forced upon us to take mineral water saying that regular water isn't good

2nd visit - very amiable staff..we were not comfortable in seats allotted, and they changed the table for us 3ice.. food tastes really good.. loved the see through stairs..

What's up is a place where you'd have the ultimate shisha experience. If you plan on having a hookah date, or even if you want to you want to chill with your friends over shisha, what's up is your to-go destination!
The interiors are nice. The service is a bit disorganized, though.
Since we were there for lunch and it was quite sunny on the rooftop, we chose to sit inside.
It was a bit annoying when they said that they don't have filter water. According to them, the regular water is tap water, which is kind of ridiculous.
We first ordered for Cajun Spiced Chicken and Irish mojito. The chicken was succulent and spicy, and the mojito had an amazing flavor. They could probably work more on the quantity of the mocktail they serve!
Next we went for Risotto Alapitoka and Kiwi Mojito. The risotto was perfect! And the mocktail was again, a treat for the taste buds.
Finally, we ordered for the much anticipated, much awaited, hookah. We chose to have Heaven 10000. And my, it was amazing! It couldn't get any better, this one!
To summarize, what's up is not a place where you'd be immensely satiated as far as food is concerned. But yes, it is one of the finest places for the shisha experience.
Bon shisha!

The ambience is quite cool and also soothing for hookah draggers like me though i felt the hookah feels quite mild and less smoky then other bars.Coming to the food its really good and one would surely enjoy it but thats nothing different then what is available elsewhere. This place has got evrything.. a great view from the sixth floor roof, a good ambience and also good food but the mammoth tax they add is quite a dissapointment.

A great place. I had plans to visit the outlet and it couldn't have been better than watching the live ipl screening at the What up terrace. Very soothing ambiance,good food, nice music but very simple flaws have bothered my idea about the place. In spite of being a quirky set up the management lack abilities to control the crowd. Service was delayed, very few people understand the instructions, Air conditioners don't work at all. And a provision to accommodate atleast 6 people in their elevators is a must or else one has to wait for atleast 10 minutes to reach the floor. Overall a good experience and planning for a visit within the weekdays very soon. cheers!!

Nice place to catch up with old friends for a leisurely afternoon. Rustic decor added a nice touch (barring the tiny elevator). We ordered a Hawaiian thin crust pizza, Chicken Roulade, Minced chicken lasagna. All the items were good especially the roulade. As for desserts, the blueberry chesscake was nice but the tiramisu rocked. Would be nice if a few more dessert options could be added to the menu. Couldn't try the jacuzzi owing to the hot and humid afternoon. Overall it was a good place to eat and jabber with friends.

This hookah lounge is located on the sixth floor of a building in southern Avenue. A guitar hoarding will greet u, walk straight in and take the lift(it can accommodate only 3 people other than the lift man at a time ). Get off the elevator, climb a few more steps and voila you'll find yourself standing outside the door.

I prefer coming here in the afternoon as I like sitting on open air wing. The ground is faux grass and gives a nice feel if you walk barefoot. I being a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic , come to this place only for the Jacuzzi. It has two tables and can accommodate 10-11 people. 

I've tried there food as well. It is good but nothing extraordinary( that you won't find anywhere else). What I don't like about this place is their pricing. The prices in the menu card seems reasonable but they add a massive 42% tax to your original total. Which is humongous. 

My friends like the hookah here and often grab a few beers( 5 pints cost 600 bucks). Don't come here solely for food, if you r a hookah person, then you'll like this place. The view amazing.

 If they don't look into their pricing then lounges like Wolves' 11 and Zucca lounge in the same vicinity will soon give them a run for their money.

Its on the top floor so the view is amazing. Good part is it has 2 sections. 1 is open and other is closed so that you can choose according to your mood. Hookah is good. Food is Average . But the crowd isnt that good. and the jaccuzi place is always full so if youre going for that either reserve it or go early

At first I thought it would be kinda small and crowded but there is enough space for a village. 😄 Decent crowd and very safe for ladies too.( VV Important) 
           
FOOD:
           The food is really yum. The Bruschetta was super crisp and freshly made and that made my evening. Also the Pizzas are super succulent. Special mention would be the Meat Lovers Pizza. Yumm !!!! 
          
DRINKS:
          Extensive menu for both food and drinks. The cocktails are pretty good. Just make sure to order as per your alcohol tolerance. 
          
HOOKAH:
          The Hookah variety was really exciting. So many different flavours. Even first timers would really enjoy it. 
          
FUN:
          The overall vibe was really youthful. Fun and hip crowd. It can get really packed but in a fun way and not rowdy. If you can wait till the very end then the crowd thins out and you can really take in the beauty of the place. 

POOL:
          Two poolside tables give off a very relaxed vibe. You can just kick off your shoes.... Roll up your pants and soak your feet while munching and drinking away. 

SERVICE:
          We were looked after by AFZAL (the floor in-charge) who made sure that we were always attended to. Very cheerful and helpful staff. 

Perfect for hangouts with a group of friends. Make sure to call and make reservations beforehand so as to ensure hassle free entry as it can get quite crowded. 

Definitely visiting again. Very frequently.

What’s Up is a quite the happening spot in town for some good old shisha, food and drinks. It has garnered a standing for itself in a short period of time for being an expert in catering to the needs of the hookah-smoking, drinking, and eating crowd of Kolkata, and rightly so. The restaurant is stylishly decorated with both indoor and outdoor seating. If you want to claim your highly publicised poolside place, do arrive early as it tends to fill up fast even on weekdays, as we discontentedly discovered (having arrived at 7 pm on a Wednesday).

FOOD: The food here is decent, though not extraordinary as far as I could tell. The main attraction of the restaurant is its shisha, which we were thankfully provided with zero extra charges for coal changes. This is what we ordered for eating during our hookah sessions:
(1) Roasted Chicken Nachos (2) Minced Chicken Lasagna (3) Dairy Milk Shake (4) Chicken Noodles (5) Teen Paan Shisha 

The Roasted Chicken Nachos was served with salsa, sour cream and ranch dips. The quantity of the dish was sufficient for an appetizer and the tortilla chips were crunchy and the chicken was a much grateful addition (not usually served).
                                          ...

Location: Cross VP, it stands tall and unassuming right beside Indthalia. 

Ambience: Pretty cool setting with three different sets of seating the outdoor one comes complete with a free flowing warm water pool to soak your tired feet after a long day at work. I ordered for blueberry shisha in spring water, it was decent. We had crispy chilli babycorn, chicken popcorn in mustard mayonnaise and washed it down with a beer bucket! 
I have taken down points only for the dismal service. The waiters may come off too strong for their own good and I got positively miffed when one tried to force me into ordering another dish over the one I had ordered. I wish the administration takes this into consideration and take steps to correct it right away. The place has a lot of promise but if the service doesn't improve it will lose potential loyal customers!

Cos their service was no where near with their ambience. And thus we waited for like half an hour to get anything served. Cmon u guys, cud have atleast brought the hookah in time. I suppose they dont like guests😂😂wel dont land up there.and if u do,make sure to keep track of ur order.

I have been here twice. It is one of the coolest hangout spot right now in Kolkata. Amazing ambience...and the view from the rooftop is brilliant! The food is really good. I have tried the hawaiian pizza, club sandwich and crispy chilli chicken. All items were delicious. The hookah with milk base was quite strong. We were lucky enough to get the jacuzzi available both times . Yet another reason to visit this place. :D Pocket pinch is on the higher side but totally worth it for a place like this. Unfortunately it is on the 6th floor and the lift can carry only 3 people at a time....so If you have a big group then you need to wait a little. I'm gonna visit this place many more times for sure!

Chill place to hang out with friends, What's Up gets pretty crowded by the afternoon. It feels pretty good to relax on the terrace when it's windy (alas, it started drizzling when we went there!). Coming to the food and drink we ordered, I did not enjoy the Screw driver. The mojito and Cosmopolitan were both pretty standard, tho.We loved the Meat lovers' Pizza but the Chicken Involuntini was a disappointment. I felt it was a bit bitter for my taste and did not suit my palate at all. Love the dip with this dish, however.

This place is situated on the terrace of a building. The elevator allows only three people and it is above the 6th floor (you can't climb that much for fun) so you have to wait for the elevator to drop and return. The place has 3 divisions, including an open space with jacuzzi tables too. Interiors are nice. Service was pretty fast. We ordered chargrilled vegetables with cilantro rice which was nice. Veg lasagne was average. We ordered three mojitos; mint mojito, green apple mojito and kiwi mojito. Frankly speaking they sell ice and mint leaves, and lacks flavour.  We also ordered a blue lagoon but that was also okay. Didn't try shisha and cocktails any further. Mocktails need to be made better. All in all an average experience.

The entrance and the lift is eewwwwww... Last month I visited this plc. But as u enter the cafe u completely forget all that, the place is pretty cool. What attracted me was the 'Jacuzzi'. But we chose to sit inside the cafe coz it was heating in the open area. The ambience is amazing. What I didn't lyk was the location of kitchen. These places shud build up their kitchen in such an area that the visitors can't find out. Well, hukka was smooth.. Starters were yummy. They are not good in their mocktails. I had got my drink changed but then also it was as same. Staffs were friendly... The service provider Irfan Bhai from the cafe is a cool man.. He was carrying a long hukka filter which is for their use only, but as I lyked it he got me a new one. Infact he gave one for each hukka, which was really sweet of him. Next tym when I visit, I'll take up the 'Jacuzzi' n for sure aftr the summers.

Located at Southern Avenue, I finally went to the famous What's up cafe with a friend. We ordered shisha in the flavour of teen pan and for snacks we ordered  vegetable sandwich with fries and salad. The place was absolutely beautiful. The indoor restaurant had dim lights and outside there was a jaccuzi, sadly that day the jaccuzi was already booked from before so we had to sit on those bar chair which resembled cycles, the wind was going on and the dj played some amazing music, it is perfect if you come here during the evening with your gang, though the place is crowded from afternoon onwards Next time I'm gonna try the mocktails and the drinks. Prices are quite reasonable

If you had to describe Whats Up in one word it's just breathtaking!! Be it the ambience the service the food or the drinks... They never let you down... The open air terrace with the mini pool is a sight to behold.. And on the rainy Friday we visited with the cool breeze it sure was enchanting!! The cocktails they serve is surely one the best in Kolkata!! The Long Island Iced Tea here can hands down be one of the best served in India!!! The balance that the LIIT had is just too good.. Afzal the bartender is surely one of the best I have come around... Not only does he know his way around cocktails but has a really friendly demeanour that is a rarity in Kolkata pubs!! Also the fondue here is to die for... All in all it surely is one of the places to be in Kolkata!! As they say you have to be there to believe it!!

Visited What's Up on the last Saturday for the second time and coincidentally figured out that it was a Russian Night out there (implies that Russian female attendants would serve the guests) and thus had cover charges ! Hence, we took the cover charge (@Rs 1000 / person) which was completely redeemable though. 
Going inside, the attendants treated us very well and we were ensured that as soon as a 4-seater becomes vacant, we would be allowed to sit at the roof top area, which was their USP, and the commitment was kept which increased my rating from a potential 3.5 to a 4. 
The food is pretty decent here, although nothing out of the world. My recommendations are Meat Lover's Pizza and Chicken Popcorn with Cheese Fondue. The Chicken 65 was okayish though ! 
The music was brilliant and so was the experience of having drinks at the roof top ! So all in all, a must visit if you look for drinks and ambiance in a pub !

The first two things you'll notice just after entering are the ship-cabin influenced decoration of the passage and the skylines of the city from 6th floor through huge glass panels. There's also a rooftop to chill with your friends. The ambience is good. But certainly the taxes are a bit too much. Like, be ready to pay around 1.2k if you have ordered foods or beverages of rs. 900. Other than that, it's al-over a good place to be in with your friends or partner. 👍

I visited this joint on 10th May which is just yesterday with my husband for some drinks and Hookah. I loved its rustic look. The idea of a Car Tyre washbasin fitting was lovely.
We couldn't get a place at the roof top as the area was crowded. Also I wanted to sit with my feet submerged at the pool! but those tables were marked reserved.

The food was good. And the Al Sikandri Hookah was nice too.

I would like to go back again, but only if I get a chance to sit by the pool or Jacuzzi or whatever it is.

It was a Sunday evening and hence expectedly it was very crowded. At first though there was no one attending but on bringing it to their concern the service was quick and spontaneous! The guy serving us was also very courteous. Most importantly the food was yum n the view makes the evening fantastic!

A casual dinner turned out to be a memorable one, thanks to What's Up (and of course Zomato). It is one of the few outlets in Kolkata that I just fell in love with. Located at the roof in southern avenue, it has a open space with a makeshift pool where you can chill with your feet immersed. The outlet has 3 sections, each one is distinctly different than the other. Ordered a lot of variety and loved each of them. Be it the shorba or the lemon coriander soup (one of the best that I have tasted) or the pasta (in white sauce) or the caeser salad. Pizza was prepared on a thin crust, much to the liking of others (I prefer thick crust) and tasted good as well. Excellent hospitality shown by the staffs who helped us throughout our stay in every way possible. And not to forget, the hookah was great as well. I will definitely visit this place  again very soon.

Went to this place in Southern Avenue (Lake Road) with a couple of friends. To be honest, I wasn't willing to enter this place as it is on the terrace of an old building with an aged out lift which can carry at most 3 people (Imagine !!!). But once when i entered the place, it was completely different story.
Some Russian group had reserved the terrace area, so couldn't sit there, but the ambience inside was also lovely. The music.... Oh wow !!. They played the best kinda music (Blues, EDM, House).
It was crowded so it took us a while to get the table. However, the staff were courteous to take care of our needs. We ordered hookah, beer and food. Hookah was very good "Heaven 10,000". Starters were delicious and main course was commendable.

And yes... Crowd Filtering is done properly, so expect a good crowd everytime.

With a great innovation, this cafe is no doubt amongst the top 5 cafe's in kolkata.. The jacuzzi, the open terrace were eye catching.. Even the prices were reasonable.. A great place to hangout with friends in the evening.. I would highly recommend everyone to try this place once in your lifetime..

And if service is fast it makes the customer feel good, Which i foud there. And allover i would suggest to visit a place atleast once N especially evening time.

Had no clue what this was all about. Went there in a si day evening with a friend who was new on town. Was reccomended by a friend as previously we had gone to bse but it was more than an hours wait,so i chose to drive down to rhis place. 

A good frontage,located on the 7th floor of a residential complex. As soon as we entered,the place was packed. 

The waiters/staff were pathetic,behaving as if they were serving for free. Just then i bumped into the owner himself as he introduced himself. He was a gentleman and i feel that if his personal intervention is not there,the place would be a flop.

They have an air conditioned place at first,followed by another airconditioned room which they give for parties,followed by a terrace,beautifully designed withs eating and a bar.

We ordered for beers and starters.  Eer came fast,but the starters took approx 25 mins to arrive. I had asked the waiter do they serve any biting? He told yes,so i asked him to get some,but that day i had not got any.

But,the wait for the starters were worth it as it was so delicious. Perfectly fried button mushrooms stuffed with mozzarella cheese and a tangy dip with salad. (Pic attached).

Over all,the ambience is dim but goes with the environment. Music collection should be better. 


I feel the place is kickass and had a lot of potential. Dont let service be a reason for the place not working out. Everyrhing else was perfect.

Must mention - Furniture is something unique with a finky touch. Stools replicated by unicycles with stand was the best.

Would give it another shot though,but just because of the hospitality shown by the owner Mr.Jeet and his wife (generally sits on the billing).

Ps - review based on vegetarian food.

Must have a visit here :)

This new and happening venture at Southern Avenue beside the Indthalia outlet surely packs a punch.Ambiance is awesome,crowd is energetic and the place has a great vibe and energetic appeal to it. It is divided into three zones and the one on the rooftop is the pick of the lot. Situated on the 6th floor of the building the place has a great view and wonderful feel to it. Food,hookah, drinks everything is available and quality wise also the food is great. Prices a are bit high but that should be expected. Overall,  a great and welcome addition to the ever increasing hip and happening party zones in the city.

I felt I have passed the age of cafe hopping. What's Up proved me otherwise. Heard a lot of good things about it from sis, so planned to give it a go. Located on serene southern avenue, the cafe has become hot favorite among youngsters. The rooftop ambience adds to the score. Well decorated interior with big screens and surround sound system, this is a cafe you wouldn't want to leave. The rooftop ambience is a different ball game altogether. The Jacuzzi in the middle is quite an attraction. Add to it another giantscreen to watch matches. The environment becomes truly magical. People are more inclined towards the various different sheesha they offer. But I was more into their food and drinks. Tried some new items like quesadilla and each item were really good. The service is prompt and friendly. In weekends owner stays inside the joint for a long time overlooking arrangements. Overall it was a different experience altogether.

Pros:
1. Ambience. Indoor and rooftop both.
2. Prompt & friendly service.
3. Several different items in menu each having a different taste.
4. Numerous types of sheesha
5. Well known location

Cons:
1. Exorbitant amount of tax makes the price too steep.
2. Lift service is very poor. It being at 7th floor, lift is mandatory.

=Date of Visit=
29th April, 2016.

=Location=
The name of the restaurant is actually hidden by the trees and maybe difficult to spot at first. However, it is just beside Indthalia which is very much prominent. Parking is a bit of a hassle as it is unsafe to park on the road. The lanes beside may be used but they are usually full.

=Ambience=
Okay, so this is the USP of the place. I have seen very few joints offering such variety in seating arrangements. At first when you enter, you get comfy sofas to sit on; in the same area, you have a high-chair seating arrangement too. This area has glass walls and being on the 6th floor, offers a nice view. Then in the next room you have an arrangement which is perfect for having sheesha with friends and also for live screenings. These two areas are air-conditioned. The last area is the most sought after and you're lucky if you get space. This is the actual rooftop area, complete with a jacuzzi (okay, so it's not a jacuzzi per se but you'll get a similar feel), a bar, a hanging chair and couple of normal tables. The breeze is so soothing here you will not miss the air-conditioning in this heat. 

=F&B=
1) Mint Mojito: Avoid. The pictures in the menu was itself not appetising but we still wanted try one which was not depicted; however, it had a weird taste to it. The longer it was kept idle, more of the bitter taste of the mint leaves was getting infused in the drink.

2) Crostini Mushroom: This is simply a bruschetta with hot toppings. They have bruschetta too but with cold toppings. (I always love choices). This had button and shiitake mushrooms with a little bit of melted cheese on top. Definitely for mushroom lovers (Plus I have a weakness for shiitake)

3) Chicken-Ham Lasagne: First, try this dish and check if you like the taste. If not, sprinkle lots of oregano and chilli flakes; tastes way better. Also, percentage of tomatoes was on the higher side. Quantity was plentiful.

4) X in Dubai (shisha): Description said it had Royal Paan, Double apple, Mint in Anaar & Apple base. I really liked the mix of flavours but disappointingly, I could only make out the apple flavour, that too, very faintly. 

=Staff=
Staff was very polite and quick. In fact, I was extremely pleased with the overall behaviour of our server until I received the bill and found that they charge 10% extra service tax. Considering that, I believe that kind of service is expected. However, I did overhear him asking customers for good feedback on Zomato, which I found weird. He asked us too but in a polite manner so we didn't complain.

Cons:
1) No dedicated parking space.
2) Some chairs in the terrace area may be quirky to look at but are extremely uncomfortable to sit on.
3) Limited options in dessert section.

=Overall verdict=
The bill amount was 1535/- all inclusive. If you avoid shisha and alcohol, the bill will be well within a thousand bucks.
Ambience: 5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Staff: 4/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

-Bon Appétit. :)

A very common place for me now as i visited quite a few times now. This place is a bliss for hangout with friends or a perfect date with your partner. Every time I go to what's up I get a very good response from the staffs there. It has been a great experience for me till now and that's why I go over and over again. The first time I went to this place was on a weekend and I couldn't get my favourite mini pool but I was in the roof and enjoyed the cool breeze. The next few times I was lucky enough to get my favourite place and even the staffs help you to get that place. The staffs here are really good and friendly. Special mention for Mr. Ali as he does a great job with the team. Now coming on to the food department, I personally doesn't have much complaints about this place. The food here is of good quality and has a good taste along with its quantity. What bring me to this place is its rooftop ambience with the mini pool. 

What to order? 
I have always ordered these things and never got disappointed :
# French Fries : Nice Crispy Taste. The quantity can be little more. 
# Crispy Chilli Babycorn : One of my favourite food items and it did not disappoint here. You can always go for this. 
# Nachos : Always a good choice to munch few of these with your beer.
# American Corn Salt n Pepper : This is just awesome. I definitely order this one whenever I go. They make it delicious. 
# Chicken Club Sandwich With French Fries & Colesaw : Another favourite food items which i usually take when I visit this place. The double layer sandwich is just awesome with one layer of egg and the lower layer of chicken with mayonnaise. 
# Blue Lagoon and Mogito : These two mocktails is always a good option in the rooftop with lovely breeze. 
#Hookah (Anything you like) : This will be a perfect thing for anyone who loves smoking shisha as this place gives a perfect ambience, and if you get that hot seat you are damn lucky. 

Suggestions :
# As a regular visitor to this place I would love if the management gives some exciting Happy Hours. This would really boost the visitors to go more often. 
# Sometimes it takes a long time to get the ordered food,  it can be looked after. 

LAST WORDS:
Just go to this place and you will definitely have a great experience. One of the main reasons to go to this place is its ambience. The view from the rooftop is great. So just go to this place and have a great time. 

A 4/5 for this place. A happy hours offer will definitely increase the rating.

Whatsup is one of those quirky places to the ever mushrooming list of Kolkata food joints. As much as the sun deck would be great during winters, the summers would be a pain. I was quite surprised at the food they serve. Generally these places come up as hookah joints, simply serve vegetarian fare and fade into distance. First things first - Their hookah is very well made. You would have to cry the Cajun Spiced Chicken. Generous amount of tender chicken which are to die for. Its a little spicy. Their cheese and chicken Maggi is also to die for. The crowd flowing in might not be that great but nonetheless, this place definitely deserves a visit. Moderate pocket pinch.

It is located on Southern Avenue. If you happen to cross Lake Kali Bari and head towards Nazrul Manch, it is situated on your left.
A full 5/5 for ambience. Perfect for easy going couples, group of friends or sibling meets. There are evidently two sections. The open air section allows you to dip your legs in a puddle of water, and also smoke.
The section inside is for AC lovers.
Service is a little greasy on weekends as the place gets filled up. On weekdays it is above average, but not great. They should work on this.
Food is tasty, and it is not a huge pinch to your pocket.
Overall a great place to loosen up.

Celebrated my friend's birthday here last Sunday. Highly impressed with the service and coordination. The service was super quick and smooth. The staff was very friendly and polite.
I had booked the place in advance and one entire section was allotted to us (around 20 heads). There were no interferences at all.

The birthday boy is a bollywood fanatic and the management actually let us play our own music for a limited period of time.
Needless to say the food, alcohol and shisha were absolutely worth the money.

Over all a very very good experience. Kudos to the entire Whatsup team.

Visited this place last Saturday with two friends. This place offers both hookah and alcohol, and it has a rooftop bar. Since it was Saturday the place was full, and service for the food was fast but they took more than an hour to serve the mocktails. In the bar section they lacks variety as they doesn't offer drought beer. The food was average. The place has both inside and outside rooftop seating. In the hookah we tried grape and mint in the ice base, the flavour was good. We got a table in the terrace, ambience was good, overall it's a good place to hang out with friends.

What's Up, located at Southern Avenue is a popular place to go to among young people. The interior alone builds up a strong case to give this place a try. They feature both outside and inside setting. They have mini pools to dip toes in. Food is decent.  Staff are too. What's Up makes real good hookahs. I'll give this place a 3.5/5!

Shabby place. Just good when the weather is good to enjoy outdoor drinks. Food is very average. Nothing to comment on it. 
Not the one I wish to go in summers for sure. The jaccuzi placed in outdoor is a good idea to attract customers but for me it is too unhygienic. 

I would pass it.

Set up- Nice

Ambience- Good. Loved the outdoor seating. Sadly, could not find a table on the roof. Reason, the evident Saturday rush. No complaints there.

Food-
Could have been so much better. We were looking for appetizers more than entrees, hence, we ordered the chicken 65, dry chilli chicken, the " Classic" cheese fondue, mushroom quesadilla and the meat lover's pizza.
The chicken appetizers were good and were quite popular at the table, hence, we also ordered seconds.
The fondue had nothing classic about it and to top it all, it was quite drippy. Yet, we being cheese lovers, did finish the little portion of melting cheese that was served in a cup (no fondue pots).
The pizza was a total let down. We were suggested to order the meat lover's pizza. We had a hard time finishing it.
We loved the drinks.

Service-
Service for the food was prompt, though the place was quite stuffed. But, when it came to the beverages, which definitely formed the major part of the order, it was a sheer dilemma.
Why do you have 3 girls roaming about waitering tables and asking people what they want, when they have a hard time taking orders, or for that matter, finding straws for our drinks?
Every time, someone who "actually does work" at the What's Up had to intervene to save the poor lost souls. Inconvenient for them and us.

Other than the roof and the view, I have nothing else that will lure me into visiting again. If we do, I hope we will be guided through the menu to find better food options.

I and my friend had visited the  cafe for lunch. We had the green apple mojito which was refreshing but a bit on the sweeter side, would have been better if it was a bit tangier . I had the roaster chicken and panini sandwich which was delicious ! My friend had the club sandwich with coleslaw . The coleslaw was bland but the sandwich was good. Overall the quantity of the dishes was pretty fulfilling and the quality was also up to the mark. Would love to visit again .

As heard from many of my friends I thought of giving this place a try.
Me & buddies went there for the booze and hookah...but the open terrace and Jacuzzi was an added advantage in this scorching Kolkata heat,would recommend to sit there as the inside lounge was mostly crowded!
the ambiance was pretty awesome coupled with some popular soft rock and pop tacks of 90's.Coming to the food and drinks, we ordered Crispy chilli chicken, Meat lovers pizza and chicken involtini, as appetizers they were up to the mark italian specialty, although I loved most was the thin crust pizza with generous amount of chicken and cheese. the beer bucket was filled with ice as we requested and the Smoke Mojito hookah was indeed one of the finest I've had in such a price bracket :D

P.S - overall we paid around Rs.1500 for taxes, for 5 people we had a total bill of Rs. 4000, so there's a pinch in the pocket I must say :P

The only good part of this place is the jacuzzi. Apart from that there is very little that one would come back with from this place. Usually full of wannabe kids puffing away on the shisha. The staff was not very helpful. They lacked any form of training. Just a bunch of guys standing and chatting around. The other mood killer was the stupid music that was on. Punjabi pop. Play some soothing music. Now coming to the food. The pizza was awful. It was totally burnt and total waste of money. The drinks were fine though. And to top it off, this forgettable experience was way overpriced considering what we ordered. The only reason people keep coming is for the open air section with the jacuzzi.

I don't remember the last time i gave such a horrible rating to an outlet which defines the experience i had here. From the time i entered the place disappointing was written all over it. The place was full and nobosy was even bothered to entertain our queries about getting a table. Finally i found a friend who vacated their table and hence i was able to get one. The place was stuffy. The AC was not working it seemed. I was literally sweating. I asked the guy there to get me a table in the open air area as soon as it is available but as expected the guy was not bothered again. I saw the tables getting cleared but he never came to offer me a table outside. I was feeling too stuffy inside. The crowd was a bit rude and low class. The IPL match was on and the Hindi commentary was on a loud volume. Absolute rubbish. They could have played some soothing music. The Management here is amateurish which is evident from the way they manage the place. The mojito drinks we ordered was high on the taste making syrup and too sweet for my liking. The Nachos was equally disappointing. The outside area though looked fine with cool breeze blowing which can be a blessing in the summers. Overall i would recommend all my fellow foodies to avoid this place as it is absolutely a horrendous cafe and yes overpriced too.

A newly opened rooftop bar plus hookah place with a top class ambience.. There are three different sections for seating.. Of which the open air segment is the star one! Food is very basic and average to taste.. We tried the crispy chilli chicken, schezwan chowmein and chicken 65 with a twist along with drinks.. The bar menu is vivid but food menu is very limited... And the special eye catcher of this place is the lovely mini-pool in the outdoor area with tables arranged within the colourful water where you can dip your legs and enjoy your drink!! Overall it's an awesome place to hang out with friends and highly recommended for a date too!

This place is located near nazrul maach. It's on the 6th floor. For Hanging with a group of friends, it's good. Ambience...ummm i won't say elegant but good. It's highly congested and noisy. You can have cigars on the terrace. Taste of food is good. Service is...neither good nor bad. If you have to dip your feet and sit on the lounge, either you have to go early or you have to pre-book. Cost is a little high though,i.e. Not so Pocket Friendly. The rating says it all!! :)

"Dissappointed" is the word that I would use to describe my experience here.
There isn't a single thing which can be praised here.
The food was average (didn't live up to the price tag). We ordered one after another with the hope that the next one would be better than the last. It only added to our bill leaving is unsatisfied.
The staff behaviour was very rude. Found them to be very arrogant.

Went with lots of expectations.. But I am partially disappointed. Ambience is good for hangout with friends with a nice rooftop view. But I felt it a bit congested and loud.
We order meat lovers pizza,crispy chilli chicken,mojito and apple mint flavoured shisha. Food was nice but the mojito was not upto the mark.

More ideal for younger folks in their 20's - however if the music was little softer, the place could have been a nicer one - specifically the rooftop arena...

Food was tasty & quantity wise quite a satisfactory serving I would say.

Stewards were courteous in spite serving on a heavy rush evening...

Interiors are innovative - and not 'on the face' type...

Great overall hygiene...

Had been wanting to come to this place since long!
Finally came here on my friend's birthday. Had pre-booked the jacuzee area. A perfect windy evening it was!
The staff is very friendly and also helpful. Thank you for providing us with the selfie stick for taking pictures at ease.
The food was light and decent to taste.
We ordered the cheese garlic bread and pizza, Irish mojito and pan shake.
Pan shake is highly recommended! It was indeed different and splendid.
Kiddos to this place :)

Visited this place quite sometime ago. You might just miss the entrance as its a narrow passage sandwiched between two buildings.
Well, to talk about the place, the decor is perfect. You'll be surprised to see how well they've converted a small joint to an extremely beautiful hangout spot. They have open air seating arrangements as well. 
Coming to the food, we just had Chicken 65 with a twist and it was amazing. Spicy and tangy, just the perfect mix of the two! 
Hukka was well made as well. 

All in all, a perfect hangout spot for small groups.

This cafe is a complete all rounder. Friendly staff, awesome ambiance, and to contribute to its awesomeness, the roof top view is there to resort upon. The food was good, and so was the hookah and the booze. The price was fair enough. All over, I would remark that it's a perfect cafe to chill with your friends.

Beautiful view of Kolkata skyline from rooftop (7th floor) as well as indoor portion. Doesn't have big space, gets congested during weekenda, yet the ambience is a hit. Food is good and trendy. Has a small variety of drinks(probably only available on weekends). But the hukkah is simply awesome. A cool place to hangout on Southern avenue..

I love the Southern Avenue stretch. and any place that is located right in the middle of it, that too welcoming the pleasant breeze from the lake is quite the place to be! I liked the ambience, although the music is way too loud. Food was great. Tried the bruschetta and a pizza. Wasn't bad. Will definitely go back again on a summer evening.

What's up cafe is located on the seventh floor of the building beside indthalia and craves restaurant on southern avenue. Hats off to the guys who came up with such a brilliant idea to convert a 7th floor space to such a cafe, and executed that idea well.
It's basically a joint frequented by youngsters. They've got a good collection of hookah. The food was also decent enough. The outdoor sitting area is also nice and has a refreshing feel. It would be a perfect spot during spring/winter mornings. 

Pros:
1. Prominent location
2. Good for hookah lovers
3. Nice decor.
4. Small tidbits like the foot massager, cycling chairs, etc add a variety element

Cons:
1. The outdoor sitting area was scorching hot a few days back. The management could think of some small awning to provide shade

I'll start off by saying congratulations to whoever came up with the idea of this place. Loved the terrace, the view is great. Thumbs up for the interior decor. The food and drinks were good. I ordered the minced chicken lasagna and was not disappointed. The shisha experience here is quite enjoyable. All in all, a great place to hang out with friends in the southern avenue region. I'd recommend booking in advance, because it tends to get quite crowded.

Totally impressed with the drink, shisha and food. It is really nice to see such places open up nearby my house so that we do not always need to run towards Park Street to have a good time. 
The open air terrace is the star studded attraction to this place. And the pool is probably their USP. One can just dip their feet into the pool and enjoy and not know when time passes by. 
Now coming to the most disastrous part of the place, the hospitality of the staff. We went there around 6:30 and it was a nerve-wrecking India-Australia match that was supposed to start. Obviously, the place was filled. The first staff that we spoke almost told us indirectly that they won't be able to provide us with a table. And, the next one we spoke to was equally rude. We were sitting inside and to catch a smoke we stepped outside, one of their staff just said downright, 'If you're not going to sit, do I give the table to some other group?' 
We get it that it was a busy night, you had lots of people waiting. But, hey, we were not there for free goodies, we are paying for the services, right?!If I ever go back, that would be because of the open terrace and I am HOPING they train their staff better. Disastrous hospitality deserved a 2 rating from me.

P.S- The taxes seemed way more than the food price, honestly.

“The entire focus, variety and creativity in the spread offered by restaurants in the city of Kolkata have changed over the past few years. Owners and Chefs and menu planners are adding twists and sometimes tweaking existing recipes that have their unique selling point and therefore, sustain and promote wholesome and healthy competition among the restaurateurs in the city,” says the very young and dashing Anirban Sengupta, partner, What’s Up, adding, “theme-based restaurants are the need of the hour and with the foodie culture Kolkattans are steeped in, there is ample space for everyone.” The 75-table cover demands around 450 customers on week-ends and people wait for tables to be emptied. They do not take reservations on Fridays and on week-ends. 

What’s Up began with finger foods mainly but has now decided to upgrade and broaden its new menu to cater to wider tastes and palates. Anamika Sengupta, another partner, says, “We have launched our elaborate a la carte menu.  Our focus has been to introduce new dishes while improving our old favorites, and yes, we wanted to be quirky as well because that’s what What’sup! is all about. We have also opened the bar section for the weekends. We conceived of recreating the adda culture of the average Kolkatan within this social space where food is an integral part of adda and they two – food and adda are mutually inclusive areas of good cheer and active participation in both.”

All of us know what the word ‘adda’ means but few of us have an idea about the roots of this culture. Wikipedia defines adda (Bengali) as a form of intellectual exchange among members who originally belonged to the same socio-economic strata but the process had democratised in modern times and reaches beyond the limits of “intellectual” exchange between and among members of the “same socio-economic group’ because today, adda has no definite place, or space, or members, or subject, or gender but has to do a little with age. A new person might join an adda any time and anyone can leave an adda whenever he/she pleases. The Senguptas and their third partner, the smiling Debraj Dey who is the brain behind the conception and ideation of the menus and the dishes have very intelligently married the concept of adda to the food they have on offer for their clients.

Adda was always there with restaurants in Kolkata because restaurants are generally visited by friends in groups who converge around a beautifully laid out table to chat, fight, discuss, argue and eat. But the difference between What’s Up and adda in a more casual ambience is that in this wonderfully decked up food place, adda has been a conscious part of the designing of this restaurant. The introduction of the hookah along with an entire variety of shishas spoiling one for choice is a beautiful add-on to the ambience or the restaurant. 

The starter, called Mezze Platter, gave a kick start to the wonderful mean that followed, a beautiful combination of Thai, Italian, Continental and a mixture of several dishes. The Mezze is a Lebanese dish that consists of crispy bread sticks that are not to be confused with the normal bread sticks that comes along with soup. These are made on the house and are served with three different kinds of dips – the paprika humus, the garlic humus and the Tzita dip which has a base of hung-curd. You simply are lost when asked which one you would choose to have a repeat of. Another starter is comprised of grilled chicken pieces flavoured with garlic and cummin and served with an aioli dip. 

The Calypso Chicken as part of the main menu is West Indian in origin having come from the Caribbean and served with Jamaican Jerk Barbeque sauce. Heavenly! The Risotto Rice comes with chicken leg pieces served along with sautéed vegetables. If you want to stick to rice, you can choose mashed potatoes instead of the rice and it stills tastes as heavenly. Risotto is Arbotio rice made in a way that every grain of rice can be felt separately in the mouth and is cooked in cheese that makes it somewhat sticky with a creamy texture.  Risotto is originally a North Italian rice dish cooked to a creamy consistency. But Debraj Dey and his Chef have tweaked it to offer a unique dish that comes with its distinct flavour, taste and texture. Wow!  There is Chicken Involintini (stuffed chicken breast served with rich Red Wine sauce with mashed potato and satay veggies on the sides), 

The next in line is Thai Prawn Curry served with rice. You can easily see that the prawns are bought fresh off the market every morning. The curry has not taken away the lovely crunch and yet the prawns have soaked in the juices beautifully. It looks as good as it tastes. An innovative starter consists of bell peppers – green, yellow and red stuffed with Risotto rice, American corn and polenta. The wide assortment of dishes in the vegetarian section includes the Italian Spinach and Corn Cannelloni (spinach and sweet corn wrapped in crepe baked with creamy cheese sauce), Cottage Cheese steak with Risotto rice, Mezze platter (crispy bread served with Middle Eastern dips).

The mouth-watering desserts on offer are Tiramisu which is so big and comes in a wide-mouthed glass jar that unless you are a really good eater, you cannot finish it alone and must split it up with your friends – two at the most. You dip a special, long-stemmed spoon to scoop out a spoonful and just go crazy over the taste and the after-taste. The other lovable desserts are less unique – Blueberry Cheese Cake and Sizzling Brownie which I was too full to take even a small bite of. So, as we took our leave of What’s Up at 122A, Southern Avenue bang opposite Nazrul Mancha, they made me promise that I would come to taste these delicacies along with the lovely paan concoction they serve that is a big hit with the clients.

this was a real revelation to me. a great lounge with a hookah bar with decent booze options and tasty food. what more can one want? and then there's the open air terrace with the pool where you can smoke away your time. the music is decent at times and at times just torture your ears. the sandwiches were very nicely served and was sumptuously decked up and they were quite filling too. a pity that we couldn't find an open air seat and for that i would go once more. 
p.s. the taxes seemed to be more than what we pay at other places.

Had heard a lot of bruhaha about this cafe on zomato so finally dropped by this cafe last weekend...it's located on southern avenue bang opp to nazrul Mancha. This cafe us on the roof top and the interiors are very nicely done...Very modern with cartoon scripts...but the breathtaking view of the terrace garden is something you cannot miss.

Since we were a little too early for lunch and as it was sunny,we chose to sit indoors,the staff is very courteous...we ordered for pina colada,blue lagoon (safe bets) and crispy chicken with mustard mayo.

The drinks were as they should be tasting...nothing extraordinary about it and the same goes for the crispy chicken.

The only interesting thing about the food was the cutlery that they provided...tiny skewers instead of forks.

Overall the place is worth a visit...but do come during the evening as I believe it is much more lively then...Will surely come back.

The ambience is just way out of the world. The waiter boys were very friendly and helpful. But I was little disappointed with the food specially with the chicken nachos. It could be better. The pasta was good but I have tasted way better food than this. Overall my experience was good.

Visit the place at last night. Superb place to chill out. Nice innovative decor, well seating arrangements, we are at roof top open area, awesome view. Place situated at southern eveneu, special attractions is jacuzzi seating arrangements. Which I found innovative, this particular idea gives this place a significant mark, we ordered for Conji chicken, nicely prepared, but I found little extra spicy, then we had chilli garlic chicken noodles, all together food was really good, appreciate guys, even service also nice. Over all nice place to chill out in jacuzzi specialy, well done guys,  keep it up, will love to visit again.

Splendid is the word that I could come up with for this place.  The rooftop with that Jacuzzi table just blew my mind. Awesome sheesa, great food and that lovely open air sitting arrangement with that spring breez. What  more can I ask for? Not to forget that delightful brownie sizzler. But I would suggest not to order the sheesa if you are sitting inside, for it may be a little suffocating. And yes.. the choice of music could have been a little better.. nevertheless it's a great place to hang out.

My friend and I went there after a long day of cafe hopping. The ambience is beautiful, especially during dusk, when its not too crowded and the weather is really soothing. We went to the portico area with the jacuzzi which was amazing. You can also sit on pretty unicycle shaped seats, if you don't want the jacuzzi. We ordered just a hookah for we were pretty full when we reached. The staff is extremely polite and the service is more or less prompt. Both of us loved the hookah. Price is pretty reasonable for what all they offer. If you want a place for a date night or just to catch up with friends, which offers quality food and drinks, this is the place!

We tried sandwiches, mocktails, coffee and pizza. Didn't like the pizza though. Service is ok , could have been much better. Couldn't try their jacuzzi since it was a rainy day.

The music was really loud, ear splitting loud and they have the same songs repeating. It was so uncomfortable sitting in there but without the option to sit on the terrace part (open part) because of the sun. I tried scotch on the rocks but glass was tall lassi glass not made for drinks.  They really lack on the drinks menu, very few choices of drinks and I couldn't find any cocktail on the menu. The decor isnt bad but isn't too good either, but there's lack of ventilation in the rather small room and with people smoking sisha in there the flavors really gets mixed up. 

As for the food I ordered a club sandwich and that was the worst club sandwich I ever had. A single piece of tomato the size of my nail (yeah that small), really old and dried lettuce and chicken with so little cheese it was literally dry. I'm giving 1.5 for the free wifi, the oonly good thing about the place.

A city which still lacks adequate number of Rooftop and Open Air food joints, Whats Up indeed comes up with a fresh air literally.. Located next to both Indthalia and Crave Foodworks  on Southern Avenue this place score perfectly on its ambiance.. Though it might be a bit confusing to find the entrance as one needs to head towards a narrow alley..
They have two separate seating arrangement, one in the open air where u can feel the gentle breeze while sipping on your mocktails, and immerse your feet in the jacuzzi to enjoy an unique experience altogether.. or you can choose the indoor seating with a huge glass pane covering an entire wall looking over the skyline covering the soothiong view of rabindra sarobar and the adjacent greens..
Coming to the Service, definitely botched by the servers and need to be improved immensely.. they had to be asked for water repeatedly and were not ready to come up and follow up on their own..Even seemed to be a little off about their specialities as well.. Still we found they do serve an interesting array of Continental and Asian cuisines and zeroed on following:
Chicken 65 with a twist: Tossed with capsicum and onions, with a tinge of curry leaves adding to the flavour..it was spicy,tangy and crisp but honestly can't find any twist..
Chicken Roulade: Chicken breast fillet stuffed with spinach,cheese and herbs..baked and then deep friedin bread crumbs.. i felt it was over-fried which made the roulade a tad too dry.. also the fillings was not coming out distinctively in terms of flavours..
Chicken Thai Red Curry with Rice: The portion was sufficient for twin-sharing.. the rice was served in a wok.. loved the aroma of the thai curry..also the presence of lemongrass and basil makes it as authentic as possible..
Alongwith it we sipped Virgin Mojito and Mint Mojito to wash down the food..
One flaw I must mentioned since the indoor area was a bit stuffed with tables, the smoke of the Hookah could be a bit of bother for non-smokers..
Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1588/- (all incl) for two people, so effective tax on the total bill comes to around 33%!!! Would like to visit again for their open ambiance and try out other dishes..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

A new hangout place on Southern Avenue, Whats Up scores because of its rooftop ambience..Though things can be slightly more expensive but you expect that in the Southern Avenue stretch. Overall I loved it.. Hats off to the management for such an innovative idea. The only con would be that it tends to get very crowded in the evenings and finding a place can be tricky.

"This place be the shizz!!
The hookah be the shizz!!"
Well, you could go with this tagline once you visit this damn glorious of a hookah bar.

The ambiance makes you go WOW!
Massaging pedestals, Jacuzzi that too with no roof on top, great music going on (although you might hear the occasional hindi stuffs).
I found myself basking in the afternoon sun during a not so cold winter afternoon, soaking my feet in water while the bubbling jets worked their magic, while taking a drag of hookah. BLISS!! 
Ordered a hookah only (Teen pan flavor), wasn't in the mood to try out food or drinks.
Coming back to the icing on the cake, the hookah is smooth, the smoke is dense , it lasts long, no troubles there, plus you get a complimentary coal change, what can be more awesome than that.
But wait! there is! The price of the hookah is reasonable and similar to that of other known and famed hookah bars around the city.
The staffs are attentive and the service is fast so no complaints there.
Only downside is that you might not get a chance to experience the Jacuzzi because it is kinda always packed.
Looks like Southern Avenue just got the best Hookah Bar it can have, and that I got a hookah bar which I'll visit frequently.

We have visited Whatsup today and had some yummy food and hookah. 

The cherry on the cake was the news... Whatsup is named as THE BEST HOOKAH JOINT IN KOLKATA by The Telegraph. We have clicked the pictures of food, award and what not! The time spent over there was super awesome. Here's the gallery. 

[P.S: To me, Whatsup is not only the best hookah joint in Kolkata but also the best looking restaurant in Kolkata with the best ambience and the best restaurant that offers the most innovative cuisines. Who could have imagined Paan could be in used as beverage?! The delicious Paan Shake totally amazed me tonight.]

Located at very convenient place ... Southern avenue this cafe is the new den of the people looking for some fun... The place is at the 8th floor on the terrace. They have both open air as well as closed door sitting arrangements. They play a little loud music. The decoration is beautiful with innovative lights n light sheds and they even have a jacuzzi in the open terrace. Well coming to the food , they have only finger foods. The pizzas are really worth trying and are very tasty. They make very creamy pasta.. Its delicious. I tried their Cajun spiced chicken and garlic bread. Both were good. They have good flavours in hookah. The  They serve alcohol on Fridays Saturdays and Sundays only. They don't have much of varieties on alcohol. The place itself is very relaxing. Worth a try.

This is a very good place to hang out with friends... Maybe not with family or your better half because of some elements in the crowd. The group seated next to us was rowdy and misbehaved with the staff who were trying to do their best. It was later replaced by another group which was not keeping its conversation to itself. The problem was that the conversation was not particularly of a civilised nature. I'd suggest the management to filter the crowd. Anyway, the ambiance was nice. Choice of indoor as well as outdoor seating... Gotta try out that jacuzzi seating next time! The food was good. Their noodle wrapped chicken was one of the best appetisers I've had! The shisha was smooth, although they didn't use ice in an ice-base hookah (probably cuz they ran out of it), but I let that go because I was in good mood... :P
The mocktails were fine, and although the waiters were swamped because the place was packed, they tried hard.

Located opposite Nazrul Mancha, this place is 10 minutes auto ride from Kalighat Metro station. Travelling all the way from North Kolkata for this the café which has been making a mark of late, was definitely not worth it! It's a small and congested place (divided into three sections) and for a no hookah group, the place is surely not recommended. Space crunch is surely an issue. For the Jacuzzi, it must be reserved well in advance. Even on a weekday, the place was almost full. The service was slow so we kept our order to drinks only. Three drinks took a minimum of 20 minutes to half an hour to be served. The Pan shake had the authentic pan flavour, the fresh lime was refreshing but the green apple mojito was a disappointment.

We went to this place on an impromptu plan. But I am glad we did. This place is located on the 6-7th floor of a building and the lift was not working so we had to take the stairs but it was worth it. 

Served by neil, we were seated in the indoor area. The place has a very good ambiance. The music was a bit loud. They also have a really awesome looking area in the open with a small jacuzzi but it is advisable to book it in advance if you plan on seating in open as its mostly full. 

Coming to the food, we ordered a Cottage Cheese Steak with Risotto Rice on Neil's recommendation. It was really well prepared and the taste was perfect. We also ordered a Three cheese fondue, Mediterranean pizza and Nachos. The fondue was okayish but the Pizza and Nachos were really good. The drinks were also nice. The sheesha although a bit expensive was one of the best I have had here in Kolkata. 

All in all, this place is a must visit for its food, ambiance and sheesha. The only reason I have given a 4.5 is because I found this place a bit on the costlier side.

Visited this place when it had just opened. Right when I got out from the elevator and saw that the owners have cared to carpet the entire entrance, I had a good feeling about the place. It is not a rooftop place only, but have two other sections inside. We didn't get a chance to sit at the jacuzzi table since it was occupied, but will never forget a big group's (that came in later) reluctance to sit at it on the pretext of floating skin cells of previous occupants' feet in the water and the chance of dropping phones in the water, ever! Hilarious!! Let me assure you the water looked very clean and next time around would love to sit at it, or the swing chairs may be, or the bar stools which have wheels for legs, or the ones with the foot massager....aurghh! I can't decide. In food, we had chicken 65 with a twist, chicken roulade and meat lover's pizza! All were great.

A decent place to be. When this place featured on one of the place to visit in Kolkata, I immediately added it to my bucket list. Did go there with a lot of expectations. Not that I was greatly disappointed but it's nothing over the top.

The place is good and so is the ambience. Maybe they need to work a little more on the kind of music that they play.

Food is definitely good. The Spicy Cheese Fondue with Chicken Popcorn is nothing too good but the Hawaiian PIzza is really good.  Also, did try the Grape and Mint Shisha. The flavour was light and was nice.

Went to this place on a sultry afternoon with three more friends. Preferred sitting indoors. The open air area is decent too. Coming to the food, we ordered Pesto pizza, Formaggio pasta, green apple mojito, blue lagoon mojito, Oreo cookies shake and Nachos.
Nachos were pretty decent. Loved the cheese dip.
Mojitos were amazing. Blue lagoon was different from what I've tried in other places and it was actually good. Green Apple was delicious.
Oreo cookies shake was also delicious.
Coming to pizza, we ordered a thin crust pesto which turned out to be good. Could have been better.
The only minus point about the food was the formaggio pasta (mixed sauce). It was eatable at first but later, all we could find was oil floating all over it. Could have given this place a much better rating if not for the pasta.
Coming to the staff, they were very hospitable and friendly. A big thumbs up to them. An extra star to this place only because of them.

EDIT : Second Visit :
Tried Chinese this time. Hakka noodles and Veg Manchurian were simply fantastic. And served in good fulfilling portions. KitKat Shake was the best part about the evening. The staff was really friendly. Looking forward to visit this place again!

I had immediately added this place to my bookmark list when it had newly opened and I first saw it on Zomato. And I got the chance to visit it real soon enough on my friend’s birthday. That was about 3 months from now.
The place has some amazing interiors and the management has put in some innovative ideas in the décor which being attractive at the same time can sometimes connect to peoples’ lives. The inside portion is pretty much it with couches and tables. The terrace portion however is a completely different story. The best café cum Jacuzzi in town are lesser words to describe its beauty. The ambience is an absolute bliss.

Apart from great furnishings, the food here is also ambrosial. We had Arrabiata Pasta, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Garlic Bread and Spicy Mean Pizza. All the dishes were really well primed and had excellent taste. The shishas were also really well prepared with good flavours and smoke. The mocktails are also good  here.

The service was pretty quick even on a busy weekend. The servers are nicely familiar with the menu and have no confusions with the orders. Having said the place is on the expensive side compared to other cafes.

After waiting for a long time I finally visited this place with my friends on a saturday evening, but couldn't get the terrace seats and finally settled with the indoor seating which still had a good view through the windows.
5 stars to the ambiance & decor.
It would have been the best hangout place if the music wasn't too loud.
The food was on the costly side but quality was excellent, I felt the price higher with respect to the quantity they were serving.
Overall the feel & experience is very good.

As the cafe is located in an area which attracts a lot of youngsters, What's Up became one of the most hyped café that has opened recently.  The cafe has been divided into 3 rooms each having a different unique decor. The place is perfect for a large group of friends but is unnecessarily loud. 5 points for the food though. :)

Happen to go to this place over a weekday.... firstly the location is amazing, right up southern avenue, easy to find, and definitely makes it a destination for a lot of young people. The entire cafe is segregated into two segments, an closed setup and a roof top setup. The rooftop setup looked pretty sleek , with some innovation added like a small water pool made along the tables, with some hookahs doing the rounds. The food seemed good as well, a bit pricey but then such places are always a bit on the higher end. What was disappointing there was the choice of music that was being played ! Not too soothing to the ears and pretty loud, especially if you are sitting in interior segment of the cafe.

However definitely worth going down once, and decide if you would like to go again !! I would definitely visit again and sit at the outer bit, its fun :)

Happy Munchin ! Cheers !!

So the knee depth open air jaccuzi that you get to enjoy along with hukka and other things is by far the biggest attraction. However that comes with a caveat. It can support only two groups of 4-8 people and is often the first one to get filled. 
Oh and also, they serve alcohol only on Fridays and Saturdays.

A great place to hang out with friends. Although the attractions of this place are the jacuzzi tables and shisha, we did not take advantage of any of the two. But that does not mean that any less fun was had. My friends and I had gone for a late lunch. We ordered Chicken-Ham lasagna, Meat-lovers pizza and bruchetta. The food was very tasty and we felt like having more. The open-air setting on a terrace is a welcome change from the conventional cafes in the city. I will definitely go back for more of that food this time maybe with a seat by the jacuzzi.

New place opened up in a posh location in Southern Avenue.
Ambience (3/5) : Its an open air cafe with an innovative seating having jacuzzi tables. Inside it was too much smoky - might get choked because of the shisha smoke - it was unbearable! The roof top was just fine but space was too little.

Food (4.5/5) : What I really liked about this place is their good starters. All the chicken items were damn tasty.

VFM (2/5) : It's an excessively high priced cafe compared to the quality of cafe it is. I have visited better cafes with reasonable prices. It is not at all value for my hard earned money!

The open air theme doubles the fun..price on the higher side. Handful of Kolkata restaurants offer fondue in their menu. What's Up scores high there as well!

I was visiting this place for the first time with my  friends. After 15 mins and after complaining to the manager we finally got a table and after 10 mins of waiting someone finally  came to take our order. We ordered for teen pan hookah. The hookah was terrible, was choking. We felt as if our lungs will come out and fall on the table. We asked them to check they didn't even bother. Then we ordered for food. No comments for the food. I mean how can someone serve food so pathetic. We ordered for spaghetti it tasted really bad. Chicken was very hard. So we did not order anything else and left in half an hour from that place. Service very slow. Overall a bad experience.  Would never like to visit again.

I found this place overhyped. A jaccuzi in a small terrace and you share it with 4 other couples.. that's not my idea of having a great time. Chose to sit inside. Hookah was average. Food was bad. Its always overcrowded with people and you can't really have your 'own time'. Although I would like to try the seats outside which were appealing. Overall its an average place to me as of now.

A good place, a nice place to chill with your friends, the decor and the ambience is really nice. A great place for all selfie freaks!
Shisha is good too, but the food is just average. Slightly on the pricier side, but its good for a one time experience.

This place has recently caught all the teenage attention of the town. And why should it not, offering a jacuzzi, rooftop, edm music,  and great lights.  Frankly it's a great place for a date. 
Now to be very honest,  this is located on the 7th floor, and lift being small can take only 3 ppl at a time.  So after you have courteously let all the pretty girls go first, you are compelled to take the stairs. When you finally reach your destination,  you feel happy and sad at the same time. Happy because you've finally reached. Sad because you seriously can't believe the queue of 2hrs for sitting in the 'jacuzzi'.  Then after you've made peace with yourself,   you with your gang decide to sit inside,  on the couch.
Now there's always some strange music videos continuously playing,  strange because you see a lot of crotch and twerks and you wonder why the hell have you come here.?  The pretty girls outside are your answer. 
Calm yourself.  now order a good paan flavor hookah and take a deep puff. 
Feel thirsty?  there's no regular water, so set aside 40 bucks for that.

Now the food. Its okay to be honest. 
Ordered some chicken popcorn with mustard mayo,  cheese fondue with bread croutons.  
Chicken popcorns were really small, the coating could be made better. Cheese fondue was good though.

I went here on a Saturday evening which is the most happening time of the week!(Get reservation to book the top rooftops seats)The place was crowded so we could only manage to get the indoor seats which was a bummer, considering the roof top is their main attraction.

Food: They have an abundant menu of HOOKAHS, so please try at least 2 different flavors if you are into it. I would suggest Heaven 10000,Smoke Mojito or Teen Chilium with a Red Bull base of course. Food is decent quality(would not call is great!), can do better with more care to the finishing i believe. Some dishes felt dry and had to constantly sip on my glass.The Chicken Nachos I had was terribly organized with the chicken placed under all the nachos?! But the taste was not bad!

Service: Service was better than the food! They had enough personnel who were prompt and helpful and did not keep the customers waiting. Luckily they were well behaved as well which is somewhat of a rarity and bonus I would say, as I see a growing arrogance in this particular service across the city.

Ambiance: The USP of this place is the rooftop setup and so most points to the designer of this particular joint and ambiance wise it will topple  a few places popular places of not many. The indoor arrangement was not that good though, it felt stuffy on a January night! I wonder what will happen in our humid summers(Depends on how much they want to spend on AC *wink*)

Verdict: Good place to hangout of you want to have a nice ramble with your friends, smoke HOOKAH and have some finger food.Its not that heavy on you pocket(I spent less than 1K and I was full) Avoid the Pizzas,Nachos. Not a place to have a romantic evening.

What's Up came to our rescue, one fine evening, when me and a couple of friends were looking frantically for a place to get some coffee. Located conveniently on the 7th Floor of a building, this lounge is complete with hammock like stretchable lounging chairs, a foot massager and a Jacuzzi- though the area around the  Jacuzzi remains really crowded at almost all times.  The open-air rooftop ambiance is nice on a sultry evening to sip on that coffee. The servers are polite but since the place is really new, I found them somewhat confused about how to handle the crowd. The food Menu wasn't really anything out of the mill, it included the basic fare which you will get in almost all cafes. We took to mock tails and a coffee and both were good, the drinks did their job and left us refreshed, however, one of the cold-coffees had way too much ice. I might go back just for the ambiance and the Jacuzzi, but not for the food.

Another rooftop in kolkata that serves hookah.
They serve drinks but only on Friday and Saturday.
Collection of hookah is really good.
Heaven 10000 is a must try from the hookah menu list.
Food is delicious. Pizza especially.
It's a place where you can spend time at peace. Since rooftop, one can get a good view of the surroundings. Which is nothing but lush green.
The staff were really nice.
It's a must visit place!

I went to this cafe first during Durga pujo and it was just 16 days old then. Since that, they've come a long way. Food and hookah are pretty good. Whether it's the Chinese dishes or the pasta, the quality is very good. But in this place, the ambience steals the show. The open air seating with feet jacuzzi is blissful. It's been a favourite right since. And I'm surely visiting this place quite often.

pathetic place to say the least . they charge 500 bucks per head as some cover charge or something just to sit at the open rooftop. like criusly?? there are few too many rooftop restaurants in this city that am been too and have never paid anything like this shit !!! so we had to sit at the indoors coz am not ready to pay 500 bucks to see the sky. my own house has a better rooftop view.
in the indoor they play loud pathetic and wtf music at top volume. asked them to lower the vol as we want to chat and talk and not listen to this shit. but alas ! all requests went to deaf ears it seemed.
food is the only face saving part of this whatsoever cafe. nachos and pizza that we ordered are very tasty and the quantity is more than enough for 2.
ppl jst go to this cafe to have drinks and smoke hookah. crowd is also not good. atleast not the crowd we are accustomed to at wise owl or abar baithak or any other normal nice cafe at the neighborhood.
am not gonna visit them again and will ask others not to visit this shit. too bad a place to visit .

Knowing how popular  this place is,  I still decided to give it a shot on a weekend.  Basically we went for hookah and some drinks.  

The place is right on southern Avenue and is very easy to locate.  It has an indoor seating that is really quirky and vibrant.  And a serene outdoor with a small poll to soak your feet in.  How cool is that.  

You know what is even cooler.  Well,  the only chairs we got empty had a foot massager!  I mean bliss !  

We ordered a hookah called X in Dubai.  And it was really smooth.  My friend ordered a beer and I had a fresh lime soda.  The staff was very warm especially  Afzal,  who in spite of being super crowded,  explained the menu and stuff to us with full patience.  There was no hurry and the place was very vibrant.  

We had a great time and next time we will soak feet and have lunch! 

Cheers

If you like shisha, this really is the place to go to. I think we were the only people who ate actual food. Everyone was busy puffing away. One thing that is not mentioned in Zomato is that in order to go to the rooftop, there is an added charge of rs. 500 per person. The rating of 2.5 is only because the pizza and nachos that we ordered was quite good. Otherwise, there were many negatives. Extremely loud music which the staff didn't bother to lower despite our constant complaints, the overall stuffiness of the indoor café due to everybody puffing at their shisha's.
If you want shisha's at reasonable pricing, this is the place to be. Else, avoidable. Ting! ;-)

We found this place pretty serendipitously.

Great place with good music and unique ambience. If one is in the mood for some rooftop experience, yet want it chic, this is one place to try out. I specially like the unique seating on the rooftop, where you get to immerse your legs into water (warm water during winters).

We had ordered Chicken Roulade based on their recommendation, and weren't disappointed.

Their Sheesha's looked enticing too.

Overall a place with good music, different kinds of seating (indoors + rooftop outdoors), pocket friendly menu and having pretty much something for everyone.

Nice view from terrace. The poolside setting just spices up the ambience. Some facilities like foot massager can help you to relax a bit.
For food, 3 cheese fondue is nice.
At last, Hookah at terrace at 10 pm in night with your foot dipped in water that too in winter can give you a feeling which you can't have everywhere.

Located in southern avenue, near Nazrul Mancha. Both indoor & outdoor, Interesting sitting arrangements Nd decorations, terrace is on 6th floor from where you will get a nice view of the city. Food, shisha, alcohol all are quite good.. Friendly stuffs but the service is a bit delayed. Only drawback is so loud music. If you are in group its hard to gossip specially if you are sitting inside, although the choice of music is good. If you love old English classics, terrace is your place to sit & enjoy. Terrace is perfect for winter afternoon or summer evening ! Must try : Dry chilly chicken with extra spice, pizza, shisha !

A perfect example of WORST HOSPITALITY - WHATSUP CAFE.

I had been here before as well and had a really great time. This cafe has changed all their staffs and the new staffs recruited are very arrogant and bad with the behaviour specially the main manager out there. Many tables were unreserved and they were not wanting the customer to sit as per customers choice and acting outright rude. I personally got really upset with the behaviour. We are customers and you are in this hospitality business and your main aim should be how to enhance the overall experience of the customers. However, thanks to WHATSUP CAFE for ruining my experience which will not make me go there again for sure. They don't even have any sense of politeness while talking to customers. They think they have achieved heights but let me tell you, if you continue to be arrogant and rude to the customers, many of the customers like me will stop coming to your cafe. As i had come here this time, i tried the quesadilla and spring water rasna hookah. The quesadilla was nice as usual. However, the hookah was not as great as i thought and wasn't smoky at all. However, in front of us, they were shifting other customers to terrace section whereby i had already told them many a times that i want to sit there. This is absolutely bad behaviour on the part of management and i will not come back again unless they apologise it to me. Disheartened and disappointed. I even told them to serve food before hookah but they continued doing what they thought was right. Very rude and arrogant behaviour. If it was my cafe, i would've fired out all of them together. 
=====
What's Up - Newly opened cafe having a roof terrace to chill and enjoy.
=====
Location + Intro:

What's up is located in Southern Avenue. Right in the building beside Crave Foodworks. 6th Floor.
The Cafe has got a positive vibe to it and has indoor as well as outdoor seating. The decors are beautiful and so are the lights. Entrance to whats up is also nicely made by attaching a lot of wall frames. 

I had been to this place to enjoy and the day i went, it was quite full. I wanted to sit in the terrace but somehow was not being able to get a seat. I had met one of my college friend here and we wanted to pull some sheesha and have a random discussion.
=====
What we ordered: 

1) Kolkata Mint Sheesha - The sheesha was good, smoky and lasted long. The flavour was good and really chilled up the throat. #musttry 

2) Quesadillas having spinash, corn, cheese inside and olive on the top. Served with salsa sauce, beans and white sauce with a bit of spicy rice. The presentation was excellent and so was the taste. The coating was soft and the fillings were just melting in the mouth. #musttry 
=====
Pros:

• Prime Location.
• Presentation of Food was Excellent.
• Good hospitality.
• Food tasted good too.
• Great Ambiance.

Cons:
• Music was too loud.
• I was served Crispy chilli baby corn by accident. Please take care of the tables you serve on.
• Prices are a bit inflated. 
=====
Meal for two: 600-1200 
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.7/5
Food Taste 3.9/5
Food Presentation 4/5
Ambience 4.1/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
Value for money 3.6/5
=====
Conclusion: 
I did get a seat in the terrace after a long long time. Thanks to Team What's up. I would love to visit in the near future specially to chill during winters in the terrace and enjoy the sheesha as well as the air. 
❤

This is one of the trending joints in town right now, hence decided to pay a visit after office yesterday. The entrance through a normal boring building and then in the tiny lift took me to a brightly painted corridor, and I got all excited and looked forward to a fresh and colorful place. But as soon as I entered, it was just dark and smoky, and filled with the smell of overtly sweet sheesa. The outdoor seating was full, so had to sit inside. The food was very ordinary and I couldn't wait to come out and get fresh air. 
Indoor hookah parlours aren't my favourite, and hence didn't really enjoy it. However, would love to sit in the outdoor area one day, and hopefully have a better experience.

Bad service ,foods are reasonable,but above all very cheap mentality expresses by them. We  three people took seat on the open to air roof,but we were transferred inside coz they had to accommodate another 9 people there. They were discussing that according to the bill amount  they had to give priority to the customers. That is why we were transferred inside and those 9 people got priority over us. This was very much embarrassing.

This new promising place in the booming Southern Avenue has all the ticks to attract attention .. With a special roof top area it is a big thumbs up for the weather and people who like open air seatings .. However this was my second visit here and I am still disappointed. The waiters are confused and over smart and sometimes pushy and the seating on the roof is very uncomfortable. They served cafe latte in a sad mug less than half full and on complaining they justify by saying this is what we serve (this was the second time I ordered the same drink and earlier the quantity was till the brim), the pizzas are ok and surprisingly one cafe frappe had chocolate syrup and the other did not. Hookah is however decent. The pricing is a little on the higher side for the service, quantity and quality . They surely can play better music too.

What's UP is located few steps ahead of vivekanand Park just beside Crave Foodwork.

Let me first point out WHAT UPS this PLACE has:
-> The place was jam packed when we arrived. But the owner was generous enough to get a table ready for us at the terrace on single request. so we didn't have to wait long.
-> Impressive outdoor seating, the view, the wind (specially in this season) was breathtaking.
-> Very reasonable prices food , beverages and shisha. We ordered Nachos, Pizza, Baby corn, Mint mojito. Presentation was one of the bests I have ever seen. Taste was also good especially the Nachos. It's a must try. Thin crust pizza were also nice.
->Though the bartender is not so good in flipping bottles and in any other trick, but he surely impresses people around by setting fire to the bar.
-> Pocket pinch is moderate.
Downs:
-> Service is tortoise like.
-> Staff is polite but they pay more attention to customers who'll give a substantial bill.
-> Music is pathetic. Like really. Had it not been the ambiance and good food, I would have left the place.
-> The water in the pool wasn't clean. There were ice cubes and pieces of corn floating. They should filter it more often.

All in All, this place is very good to chill, to take photos and have a good time.

Have visited this rooftop hookah joint a couple of times and havent been disappointed. It's pretty easy to locate on the Southern Avenue road. Parking is a problem, though. 

The look and feel is quirky. The beverages are good, shisha smooth and staff super polite (and they aren't allowed to take tips). There is a tiny pool if you want to dip your feet in while you puff. 

Music was a disappointment once when they played punjabi pop all evening. It was good to start with, but you get bored quickly and feel weird. On the other occasion, it was soulful.

Had i written this review on my first visit i would have given it 5/5! 
Bt after visiting it 2 more times my views changed a bit.
The hookah here is really good bt the last 2 times the quality of hookah served has detoriated and we have to get it changed always! 
Also the jacuzzi sitting area is very uncomfortable! 
Apart from that the food is great and tasty and overall an amazing experience!

It's located beside Crave Foodworks in Southern Avenue at the top floor of a residential apartment. Nice interior with an awesome ambience, the cafe is divided into 3 parts of which one is a roof top with a small pool to soak ur feet. Shisha is great but very few variety of food which needs improvement. Service is slow but staffs are friendly. Overall an average experience.

Below average experience.. the orders got mixed up twice, and till the time the food reached us it had gone cold.. out of around 7 dishes ordered by us, chicken popcorn with cheese fondue was good. Rissoto was not good at all!  fruit chillam hookah was really nice.. they need to work on the quality of dishes.. the taste is not worth the price.. the ambience was nice but they really need to consider their service!

Whats up is a new and upbeat cafe located near crave foodworks in southern avenue in a residential complex's terrace. The place promises an awesome ambiance and a rooftop view, also a pool to soak your feet in. 
It's a perfect place to unwind with your friends over a hookah and some really nice delicacies to devour. 
What we ordered:
1) Corn and spinach quesadillas-  what a perfect start it was. Too good. We had to repeat it in the end.
2) Nachos- Poor. Very bad.
3) Pasta in mixed sauce- pretty decent, ample exotic veggies, perfectly saucy.
4) Cheese garlic bread- well, awesome is the word. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly baked. Good portion size. 5 big pieces in one serving.
5) Veg pizza- one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had lately in any hookah joint.
6) Country lemon- a nice and refreshing drink complimenting the savouries perfectly.
7) Double apple mojito- amazing, minty fresh, refreshing, balanced.
8) Oreo cookie shake- so chocolaty and creamy that the flavor instantly bursts in your mouth.
9) Strawberry cheese shake- tasted horrible, an unnecessary invention I must say. Something went terribly wrong with the drink.
10) Fruit chillam hookah- Super smooth, lasted long.
All in all, a very nice experience. Friendly staff, awesome ambiance and perfect food. Visiting again in the winters.

Located very close from golpark, whatsup ticks all the right boxes. Be it the food, the ambience, the amazing view from the rooftop, the innovative jacuzzi or the extremely cordial server Prince, whatsup had me impressed and how! The price is reasonable and they serve some of the best hookahs in town. A definite recommendation for a night out with friends. The only downside is the lack of alcohol. But other than that Whatsup never fails to please.

Okay So a special mention to this pizza!! In general I never liked the food available at #whatsup and so while ordering food today I was very hesitant, but yeah their ambience hookah and their servers are just awesome so one of the servers #afzal i guess was his name maybe I might be wrong, promised me that If i didnt like this pizza he would not take any money from us and instead change the order for us,and if i did like it i would post it up on zomato and instagram, so i guess yo@u all know now. Hence, this post , this pizza was really good and he made it a point that i liked it and thats whats great about #whatsup #loveyouguys #awesomejob #greatpizza #Mediterraneanpizza #goodtimes #foodblogs #4thtimeinarow #lovetheplace

So it was on my birthday when I first visited this place. Late hours getting done with work means lesser places I can visit. This place, for one, is open till 12. (yay!) And they very kindly made an exception because it was my b'day and kept it open till 12.30! 
And oh, the food. Recommendations worked well with us... the team clearly well versed with what was on the menu. The baked prawns were YUMMY! The bruschetta a smart choice for veggies. The Thai Curry and the pasta were out of this world! (Being a small eater that's all that I could fit in on the first visit!)
Oh, and the hookah was AMAZING! Not a fan of fruit chillums, the server managed to convince us and boy- was it smooooooth! Big up to the whole team, who kept us informed on the progress of food prep. And also the music- so cool! I wish I could give it another 5 stars for the decor- so well thought up! Definitely recommended!

Pretty nice place.  The rooftop portion is quite nice. Food, drinks and hookah were matching  expectations. In fact I was very pleasantly surprised with the quantity. The special thing was the service. Starting from the the person who opens the lift door (uttam) till the person who attended to us (afzal), all of them made us feel quite welcome. Also plays decent music, although they could work on a little diversification there but at least the volume was perfect, enough to enjoy the music and not too loud to make having a conversation difficult. Overall quite a nice and chilled out place...a must go.

An apt place for hangout with buddies. It has almost everything to offer you starting from food to a cozy ambience to foot massage. Yes,you read it right! There's a mini pool on the rooftop where you can dip your feet and chat+eat your heart out! So girls are gonna love this place for sure!
The only drawback is that it's on the 6th floor and we got bit tired once we reached there.
Also the quality of the food needs improvement.
Otherwise I really liked the place :)

Superb superb place. First visit with friends turned out to be super fun. The best thing i should mention is their friendliness. We reached an hour before their opening time and they allowed us to sit inside comfortably. Talking about the ambiance, its mind blowing. The scenic beauty of kolkata from that height is breathtaking. Plus the outdoor seatings are too good. We ordered 2 types of sandwiches, 2 pizzas , pasta and shakes which were awesome. Truely deserves a rating of 5, if not 10 (;p)

This new place in Southern Avenue was quite decent with a nice decor and friendly staff. The whole area is divided in 3 parts one of which is rooftop which is really good option this time of the year and hence we did not get a table there. So we sat inside.

We ordered for the mushroom bruschetta which i did not like. It was so cold and the mushroom was too chewy. So we told then staff and they were nice enough to change it and get us a veg quesadilla. This was really tasty and specially the dips were really nice.

The hookah we ordered was also very good.

I am afraid the same cannot be said about their service. It was really slow and it took them a good 20 to 25 minutes to serve us the hookah. Other than that no complains from this place and a good place to try out and chill with friends.

If anything spells quirk, then its gotta be Whats'up. Located near Vivekananda Park in Southern Avenue, this place is quite an eye-catcher. The ambience is rocking. The decor needs appraisals. Be it the cycle-wheel themed chairs or the shades style mirror in the loo, everything is quirky. The view from the 6th floor(dats where it is in d building) definitely lifts the mood. The mini-pools are quite an innovation.
But, it would've been better if there were few more pools(they have only 2). Even the outdoor seating arena is quite small.
The menu is very efficiently designed keeping the needs of a cafe
We ordered
1. Spicy cheese fondue with chicken popcorn - d fondue was very yummy & it was an hell of a combination with the garlic bread & d chicken pops.
2. Mediterranean pizza - Not like the regular thin crust pizza of any other place. It actually had quite a lot of toppings & its was rightfully crunchy. The size was a bit small though
3. Crispy chilli chicken - regular pieces of dry chicken thickened in schezwan sauce.
4. Their mocktails were very refreshing. We ordered Country Lemonade, Blue Lagoon, Kiwi Mojito & Green Apple Mojito and all were equally good.
5. Hookah - We ordered Double Apple with ice base & it was the perfect high for us.

The pricing is reasonable as d bill was around 1550 for 4 of us. So dats more than wat we could've asked for. The place started pouring in & at one point of time, there was even a queue outside. Well, the servicing needs improvement. They need to be a bit more quick.
Smoking is allowed in the outdoor arena & dats a huge thing for party thugs.
Would have given it 4 stars but the only thing they lack is alcohol. Once they get d booze, the place will certainly be a lot more frequented.

This is probably the lowest rating I have given to any place till date. Located in southern avenue this place has a beautiful ambience and  that's all they have. I was so disappointed with the drink and chicken popcorn in cheese fondue we ordered we had to leave most of it.I even saw ppl in the next table leaving there garlic bread. The drink was pathetic. I would have ignored it all had the staff been a little courteous. When u have a new place u are bound to be more humble. The helping staff was too slow. The manager or in charge was very rude when I spoke to him about the change in seat.I don't think I will be happily going to this place anytime soon!

This month old cafe is located just opposite of Nazrul Manch. Situated on terrace of a six storied building they have two sections one covered & one open .. We chose to sit in the covered zone. I like the look of upholstery. The entire place is dimly lit with large glass windows. Ambience is really great. Coming to the service its extremely slow. First of all we had to call waiter for the menu card .. While placing order we were told it would take 20-25 minutes to serve the food though we ordered only 3 items : Burger , Chicken Roulade and Pina Colada mocktail. After a while the wait staff came to inform pina colada is not available so I ordered Kiwi Mojito instead. The burger arrived after almost 30-35 minutes. And Mojito was served right after that and after 7-10minutes of waiting finally arrived chicken roulade. Burger was for my boyfriend , he said it was decent and not extraordinary in taste. Kiwi mojito was good. Chicken roulade was really good but it was cold. It would taste better if served warm. Staffs' behavior is courteous. Planning to visit again to check out their open area and try out their shisha. Hope that time we will not be disappointed with food & slow service.

An al fresco cafe in the true sense of the term. The place, the set up, the air on the 6th floor, the hookah is all fab. The usp of the place is its open terrace where a section of the seating area exists. Hope they get their liquor license asap, then this place would be a killer for sure.

This place is a recent addition to Kolkata's happening café circuit. With an outdoor seating area complete with a Jacuzzi, this place is on the 7th floor of a building in Southern Avenue. Since its inception, I have already visited this place thrice. Coming to their ambience, it has three seating areas, with the indoor ones dimly lit and nicely decorated. The outdoor area is very prettily done, with a faux grass effect offering beautiful views of the city. Drinkwise, I have tasted their Country Lemonade, which tasted decent but nothing special. Also, their Mochachillo was a complete disappointment for me. It was just some cold coffee with crushed ice. Not even thick either and had no taste of the chocolate. Foodwise, I have tried the Cajun Spiced Chicken, Crispy Chicken Chilli, Thin Crust Margherita Pizza, Blueberry Cheesecake and Tiramisu. Firstly, while I like the Cajun Spiced Chicken since I like my food spicy, it is not recommended for people who can't eat spicy food. It had an extremely spicy creamy taste and was served garnished with cheese and I loved it. The chicken was very nicely cooked and absolutely tender. The Crispy Chicken Chilli on the other hand was below average. It lacked the crispyness and was nothing great. The Margherita Pizza was good. Both the desserts on the other hand was to die for. The Blueberry Cheesecake was one of the creamiest I have had, and wasn't too sweet, and had that sour tang of the berry compote which just made it perfect. The biscuit was wasn't soggy and I loved that. The Tiramisu was also amazing. The distinct coffee flavour came through and the taste of Bailey's could be identified. Over this, the desserts were served in pretty glass jars and looked beautiful. The prices are decent if not on a higher side. They also need to improve the quantity of the dishes.
The service however was something that can set people off from this otherwise good place. The servers need to be more trained and we literally had to scream to get the menu card. I couldn't get a seat the first time I visited and had to wait for a good 30 minutes before we got a seat. The dishes take a long time to come, and often we have to remind the staff about our order. The manager Samar is a helpful person and he recognised me the subsequent times I went to this place. Also, the entrance is a bad affair, since the liftman doesn't take more than 3 people at a time, and after reaching the 6th floor, one has to climb two flights of stairs to reach the entrance. I'm already a regular at this place and will definitely visit soon. Hoping that they improve their service.

It's an awesome place.... although I think the afternoon and evening will be the best time to visit this place.... I missed the outdoor seating.... since no all the places are full... need to visit again for enjoying the place.... although inside seating was good enough... and the Diwali sky helped me up to forget the pain of missing outdoor seating... no question regarding deco it was just fab.... coming to the food I had 1. Heaven 10000 in sisha.... it was ok not heavenly, 2. Cold coffee with ice cream... its also ok.. and 3. Meat lovers pizza... it was just in the way I love.... very very good.... over all food are good.... main problem according to me is the management and service.... they are lagging in both the fields... staffs  requires more training and more friendliness.... otherwise this will become a serious issues in near future.... whatever I like the place... definitely will visit again... another sad news was pocket pinch was high....

I went to this place on my birthday.. Looking at the entrance I had least expectation but it turned out to be a very nice place.. The whole ambience feels fresh.. The foot massage concept is new.. The range of food offered is less but it's good.. The crispy chilli baby corn was my personal favourite..

This is one of the newest joint in south kolkata,located opposite to Najrul Manch.The cafe is on the 6th floor of the building.I went there on a sunday(8th Nov,2015) with my cousin.First of all since it was weekend the place was already crowded and we had to wait for around 20mins,which was ok BUT then we had to wait for another 15 mins for the menu that too we had to ask for it,the service was very slow.....at first we had ordered for a hookah, 2 mocktails and a sizzing brownie (which wasn't available) so we ordered for a pizza.The hookah was smooth,the pizza was okish,and the drinks were refreshing.The prices were reasonable but would really appreciate if the service part is taken care of.

I had very high hopes while entering this place only to be left utterly disappointed... From the dull ambience to untrained waiters.. The hookah was a disaster, the beverages were served without a tray -speaks a lot about hospitality. Utterly disappointing.

Wonderful location(adjacent to crave food works in southern avenue)
Located on the 6th floor with an inside an an open air seating. There are 2 low pool areas where you can dip your feet in while taking hookah and chatting with friends.
I however, sat in the inner section with a friend. The seating is comfy and the decor very relaxing.
We ordered for a spring water strawberry hookah, strawberry cheesecake shake, KitKat shake and a pesto pasta.
Everything from the food to the hookah and the drinks were very good.
The service was super good and the owner a very welcoming chap!

Will visit again.
#Recommended for people who love good hookah and ambiance.

Its located at Southern avenue. Just between Indthalia restuarant and Punjab National Bank. I went today for the first time with my friends. It was Diwali Eve for us. Good food, Good Staff and great ambiance. I loved this place. It has an indoor as well as a rooftop seating arrangement with unconventional style. We ordered 2 kiwi mohito and bruschetta with chicken. A chicken club sandwich was also ordered following with a good salad.( I forgot the name). The most interesting part that I found was the small pool on the rooftop where you can actually chill with your feet grounded under water. Good shit plus it has a serene atmosphere with the right beat of music in the background. (not loud)And how can I forget? Calcutta looks amazing from the rooftop view. 
I would suggest for the service to be a little quick. Though we understand it was Diwali today! I am going to be a regular at this place. Keep up with the good work.

The ambience and theme is great. Only thing lagging behind is the accommodation between the staff. They are clumsy and need to ask the manager before everything they do. One of the staffs named Priscilla, was great! Hold on to her. I wouldn't comment much as you guys have just started it, but it will be a while before i visit again. Will wait till you get properly accommodated. Hookah was strong and quite better from most of the other hookah places here. Good luck ahead.

Located at southern avenue this place is a hidden gem, A rooftop restaurant with quiet unique style. Awesome ambience for hukah and light snacks. The restru is divided into sections the rooftop part and the normal section. Though we dint get the accommodation in the rooftop part but still liked the over all place very much. The foods are also very good and quiet cheap. Great place to hang out with your gang.

A wonderful place to chill.
It even has a rooftop. But there were certain issues with the manager which didnot go our way. We were asked to move away from the place where we sat initially as people who came after us had reserved that place. They had some sort of miscommunications. Instead of rectifying it, he had the guts to come up to us and tell us to shift from that place. Well this sort of behaviour is actually unacceptable.

Was planning to visit this place for quite some time. Situated in southern avenue, its a rooftop restaurant with 3 sections of seating. The ambiance is quite nice. Menu is okay, serves hookah, vegetarian and non vegetarian items. 

I think the wait staff need to be trained better. Often other customers' ordered food stuff were brought to our table and vice versa. 

The hookah choked a bit. We ordered a kiwi mojito and a mint mojito. Drinks were okay, but given the pricing, quantity could have been better.

Roasted chicken nachos were good. Presentation was good. Overall experience- good.
Shall i go there again? - yes !

New place and good experience. The entrance to the place is though not impressive but on reaching the.sixth floor and entering this cafe lounge its a wonderful feel. The interior is tastefully done and they have a al fresco seating too. I chose to sit indoors. High up on 6th floor u get a great view of the city. Coming to the food and beverage. I had a cafe frappe and later a mango shake. My companion had mint mojito. The drinks were average taste and average presentation. We had pasta. Now this was a surprise as the food reviews were not great. The pasta was awesome!!! Fresh basil...freshness in every ingredient could be felt. Great job by the Chef. The music gets 5 stars which keeps the mood on. Overall a nice place and very beautiful ambience. But the staff needs tremendous training. The kitchen area is too close and visible with lot of staff movement from the the main seating area is, which is an eye sore. Hookah was great too!

This is a newly opened restaurant having rooftop in the southern avenue near vivekananda park. It is at the 7th floor of the building... From the 6th floor you have to take the stairs. The stairs r well decorated with paints and posters... But in the lift only 3person can avail at a time , so we had to wait a bit for the lift. There is huge space in dim light. They have a open rooftop where you can smoke of your own. There is also a open table on a small pool where you can sit with your legs in the water. I had a chicken club sandwich and teen paan hookah ... Service was really good. As its newly opened, the menu is limited, but they are introducing new menu day by day. In one word it was an awesome day, good experience... Cheers...

An open air ambience - dis was sumthing da city badly needed and WhatsUp has answered nicely. Really an excellent place to hang out and enjoy, especially on a cool evening. The food was really yummy and staff extremely courteous. But it really took a long long long time to serve the food! This the management must look into and improve. This place has really has the potential to emerge as a hot favorite for the youngsters.

This is a very new place probably like a month or so.

There are a couple of things I really like about this place, primarily that they have 3 sections. Which as per my interpretation are Outdoor, Dining and Chilling. ;)
The interiors all through out are done nicely. It gives a great vibe from the moment you climb up that last floor.

Outdoor section features a bar counter sort of arrangement, where you're served hukkah (they do not have license of alcoholic drinks). This section also features their USP (i've not seen this anywhere else in Kolkata) the area where one can dip their feet in (Jacuzzi type) water while enjoying you food/ hukkah / drinks. It's actually a nice concept as long as they ensure that people don't drop food / dinks / hukkahs in the water.
Note: If that's where you wish to sit when you go, I'd suggest you wear comfortable clothes that can be wrapped up (to knee length) or simply wear shorts. (I'm not sure that they provide towels to clean up after - I think they should start if in case they don't).

Dining section: Features a couple of tables and foot massagers. I'm not sure if they charge extra for the massager. The food they serve is typically Italian cuisine. The menu is restricted as on date but in due course of time that'll also come around.

Chillings section: Feature 4 tables or so. Nice place with a view of the skyline since the place is on the 7th floor of the building.

Overall a great experience for a new place, however there is scope for improvement. Primarily the service needs to be a bit quicker and people to be available to take orders.

Hope they keep up the good work and improve the overall experience.
In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger: "I'll be back". Cheers!

This is the first place I have been in Kolkata that parallels lounges and bars in Europe and USA.  Ambience is outstanding and very posh. Crowd is superb.

Been there thrice already. Very nice place. Excellent ambience. Elegant. The open air zone is predominantly meant for winters. Even the indoor sections are very classy. Tried out some of the food... quite decent. As far as the shisha/hookah is concerned... there is scope for improvement. The place is running as a cafe/restaurant as of now... it would work out very well as a lounge.

Nice cozy place with brilliant and creatively done interiors. The best part of the place is the premium feel and the crowd profiling. Finger food is served hot and fresh and the pasta was creamy and delicious. One drawback is the service but still would recommend the place since festive seasons have irregularity in services across the globe.

Not to mention the warmth of the owners who take care of their customers and their suggestions are duely taken into consideration.

This newly opened restaurant may not offer much in terms of food but boasts of a superb ambience. Located just a few feet away from the birla academy in southern avenue, the outdoor seating area in the terrace offers a delightful open air dining experience and a stunning view of the skyline (though not quite in the scale of Blue and Beyond). It is also coupled with a jacuzzi, where you can dip your feet and relax while dragging on hookah and digging into the munchies. The menu does not offer you much options and unfortunately during our visit, half of the items were not even available. We ended up having a chicken club sandwich, meat lover's pizza and cajun spiced chicken. The chicken club sandwich was very good..the pizza however not that remarkable and the cajun spiced chicken also quite delicious. They also serve a mean hookah!! Another great thing about this place is their hospitality, service too is excellent. All that aside, they seriously need to work on their menu and assure the availability of the dishes listed on it! I hope to come back again to better food!!

Well it is the best hangout place around southern avenue. They make a great hookah with a decent menu offering pizzas, pastas and finger food which tastes good if not out of the world and justifies the price we are paying for it. The best 3 thing about the place is an amazing hospitality from the owner and the staff, beautiful budding skyline of Kolkata and the jacuzzi to relax and smoke your hookah after a days work. I hope

Awsome place. Good ambience and service. Hookah is really Nice. The outdoor seating has an excellent view of the neighborhood. They also have a jacuzzi to spice things up. The only downfall to the place is the food menu. Not much to choose from. The main course should be added or more variety should be included. Otherwise its an amazing cafe in south kol.

The rooftop overlooking the calm lake, the smartly done-up seating arrangement from the jacuzzi dip to the quirky cycle high chairs and also comfortable family couches and the ambience matches up to the ambience it aims to create.
Only if a little more variety in food and beverages can put it up to the five star rank :)
Excellent place for cool hangouts and definitely, the quirky elements make it to list of must-visits.

Visited this place yesterday for lunch.This is another great destination for food lovers in kolkata.It is located near Najrul Manch bus stoppage, just beside Indthalia restaurant .It has both indoor and outdoor seating area. Though it was Sunday still we managed a place in the restaurant without waiting for a second! 

After entering into the restaurant at 7th floor one should feel that its one of the coolest place in the town.Just loved the atmosphere and amazing view of the city from their restaurant. We ordered green apple mojito and fresh lime soda for some refreshment.and after that ordered their specialty item meat lovers pizza and chicken roulade as mentioned by their staff. Food was good but could have been better but their beverages were refreshing. 

Overall great experience and Highly recommended!

Have had very mixed feelings about this place! The first visit was amazing... The hookah was good and a dry chicken we took was good as well. The service was nice. The next visit was disasterous... We waited for a hookah more than 45 mins and still could not get it post multiple reminders. There was no one to take the order. Another group was made to sit on our table cus the place was crowded without our consent.... They were confused with the orders. I odered food which we did not get in half an hour. We had to pay the bill and leave. One of most horrible experience i have had.

The newest and coolest place of the town for the hookah lovers. It is just a stone throw away from vivekananda park, yesterday my sister and i gave it a visit . It is situated on the 7th floor and has both indoor and outdoor area. We wanted to sit outdoor to feel the surrounding as the city is viewed beautifully from there and to add up there is a jaccuzzi present to pamper yourself ( a nice place for lovers, i must say), but it was congested so we opted for the indoor sitting area which was also beautiful with shakira going on on the LED . We seated ourselves in bar chairs which has a paddle and wheels like bicycles ( i loved the idea ). We ordered a blueberry over spring water and enjoyed it their with the view of city lights from the wide glass windows . Then we shifted with their help to the sofas and ordered non-veg club sandwiches with french fries and coleslw.. loved the ambience, food is well prepared and the people here are courteous and they so keep our requests. For good hospitality, good food and great time i am coming back soon ✌
P.s. sharing few photos,more to come after my next visit. :)

We checked-in there yesterday and this cafe has surprised me like anything. The location is not at all difficult. It is right beside Indthalia, Southern Avenue outlet. The ambiance of this cafe is absolutely amazing with the appropriate blend of music and lightings. They have a wide choice of options when coming to seating arrangement. We opted for the outside zone and luckily got the chance to seat in the jacuzzi. It was absolutely icing on the cake. :D 
Coming to staff management, they were very cooperative and tried their best to take care of their customers. In one word, I would say excellent!
Food - We started off with their teen paan sheesha and crispy chilly babycorn and later on ordered their fresh lime soda, country lemonade, darjeeling tea and cafe latte. The sheesha was made perfectly and the crispy chilly babycorn was good to taste. The beverages were good too.
The only downside of this cafe is their entrance. :(
Overall, we had a great experience there last evening. :)

Ambience, food or smoke drains if hospitality is equivalent to 'ZERO'. Management might be least concerned about the behaviour of their staffs with customers, a humble request to adjust a chair was denied with a rude answer, shifting of sheesha in the ac zone was denied as they showed it got reserved as soon as the previous customers left, even one of them asked us to leave from the so called Jacuzzi setup as people were waiting for the outdoor suffocating zone. There are 100s present in the city providing same smoking hukahs and guess what they too are charging for it. Didn't have such a horrible experience ever before. People search for better options rather than this place.

Visited this place twice in 3 days, loved the place! Being on the 6th floor it gives a beautiful view of the city from their roof, which lets you enjoy hookah even more! They make the hookah pretty well. On both occasions I had hookah, and tried their blueberry cheese cake one the first day and I tried their crispy chilli chicken last night. The blueberry cheese cake was good. The crispy chilli chicken had good quantity! 
I really liked the way they have made their washroom made, the sink is quite appealing! 
Would love to visit again!

So, heard about this new place and ended up going for a chill session with some hookah and snacks. To start off with I would say that the vibe is definitely good specially the outdoor part they have. Decent view and if the weather copes, it's a great place to chill and smoke some. Alright then comes the hookah, which definitely satisfied me. Flavour and smoke and everything was just right. Then we can come to food. The pizza we ordered was Mediterranean and it was simply good tasting pizza. The pasta we ordered was not as good but wasn't bad either, can't remember the name of the pasta but it was something with chicken. I would say the service was a bit slow, however I heard the place is new so that's alright because the staff is probably still settling down themselves and with time and routine they will get better I hope. Anyways overall it's a great place. Love the interior and tiny details they have around the place. Definitely a must check out. Staff is friendly and they try their best to get this joint going.

visited whats up on 19/10/2015. Its a newly opened lounge/cafe situated on southern avenue. Its an office building the the lounge is located on 7th floor. The lift goes till 6th floor and one has to climb the stairs to reach the lounge. Awesome place, awesome ambiance, and superb view from the open air seating area full marks for that. The icing on the cake is the foot Jacuzzi where we sat its very soothing and relaxing just roll up those pants soak in the water and njoy the breeze with a nice sheesha. The inside was also nice although we didnt sit there but there were large glass windows and nice ambiance.

Tip: its better if u wear flip flops sandals or loafers so u don't have to bear the hassles of taking out/wearing ur socks shoes, it will be more convenient. don't worry they provide towels to wipe ur legs.

Food: At present the menu is very very limited, i guess they will add more items to it soon. We ordered Margarita pizza, pasta anglio e olio, crispy chilli babycorn. The quality of the food was good but taste was not for e.g. pasta lacked salt, babycorns were not cooked properly they were very dry on the inside. Pizza was so-so. They have lots of room to improve on the food part but im sure they will they have a lot of potential.
Till now they have not got their liquor licence but will get one in a few months after that it will be a full fledged lounge.

Service: It was very good all the staff seemed to be well trained and they were polite prompt & helpful.

Total BIll -  INR 726/- No wait there is a catch i was provided with a hand written bill without any VAT or Service tax. Maybe I guess they have not got their tax registrations till now. They only added 10% service charge.

Would love to visit again and maybe book the open air seating area for a small private party with friends if only they improve their food taste.

cheers

The ambience of the place is simply awesome but then again I didn't like the food atall...
Even the service was good but the food was not...
1st of all we went there on panchami, and during puja they only served fixed menu so we didn't have much of a choice...
We ordered for a cold coffee, chocolate milk shake and Darjeeling tea...
The cold coffee was very very good but the rest 2 items was disgusting...
I won't comment to much as I visited the place on a puja day but then agn improvement is required...

26th Dec'15
Nothing more to say the only thing is that the service has deteriorated like anything. We ordered for food and hard drinks so not a single glass was provided to us and then again no ice or water was given agn.
Simply I take back what I say in my previous review about the service part.

This lounge really worth cost u lil pocket pinching coz its unique.  Jacuzzi is there . U cn enjoy ur hukkha with it . Very well decorated. Food quite innovative. I orderd gum supari flevr as hukkha and for food greek salad and grill chicken. Food was really very nice. They don't hv take away system as it a brand new restaurant/ lounge. They will start it asap as per they said to us. Worth to visit. Its was a really a nice experience. I guess in southern avenue sise its got best ambience and best view evr. M sure its gona cherish ur evening with ur loves one. :)

What's up as the name suggests is a place you need to visit on the 7th floor located in southern avenue next to the Oriental Bank of commerce.. Till i visited the place lil did i know there was a lounge with a fantastic view of our city..peaceful n quiet..the lounge has three sections..and the best one happens to be in the open on the terrace..with an amazing concept of a jacuzzi pool where you can sit and enjoy food while dipping your feet in warm water ( reservation recommended for the pool). An ideal location to plan a date for someone special..
They serve a decent range of hookah and array of finger foods from pizzas to pasta and starters. We ordered a chicken Sphagetti aglio olio which was tasty and quantity was sufficient for two. 
Perfect ambience and a great location to have this lounge..thumbs up!

Overpriced dishes. Overly decorated. The owner is trying too hard on the decor while  completely forgetting about the food. Ordered kitkat shake, oreo shake and popcorn chicken with garlic mayo. The shakes were served in a small glass which seemed like a complete rip off. They tasted nothing different from homemade chocolate milkshakes. Now the popcorn chicken. Tasteless dry chicken with a saggy crust. No flavour at all. I would request the owner to please look into the food or rethink the price. I felt ripped off. Never visiting again.

Awesome ambience. Sunday was packed and service had slowed. It was their first weekend. Returned yesterday evening and got blown over by the food. Amazing veg fritters in panini. As fantastic as the roof top lawn. Must visit.

After reading the article about this new place in t2 I visited this place yesterday. The ambience and the set up are two things truly commendable but apart from that its nothing more...we ordered bruchetta promodoro and to our surprise the bread was not crisp it tasted like it was heated kept reheated and given again...the kitkat shake was good nuthing extra ordinary. 

Kindly increase the options in the menu...

Good restaurant.  Decor is one of the best in Kolkata. I mean you hardly see restaurants in Kolkata with a rooftop jacuzzi. It's beautiful, the place. Food is perfect to the t. Scampi cream was good. So was the chicken chowder and roulade. Really really enjoyed the food. I am not very fond of desserts but the cheese cake left me asking for more. Food was also very good. Perfect rather. Only one thing however. Service needs to be improved though.

I am rating this place a 4 solely because of the lovely ambience... Otherwise their service is sooo slow that I would rate it in negative.. Yes! You heard that right. Sunday evening it was, and I decided to hit this new cafe in Southern Avenue.. The first look of it ws indeed very attractive..the way the plce has been done up..is really cool. It has a rooftop area, where there is a foot jacuzzi.. Sat there for a while, but later moved out of it, as the plce became crowded.. Sat on the cushioned bar chairs instead. The view from the rooptop is awesome, and with some great music playing in the background, you are bound to like the place.
Now comes the negative part. The service is horrible. Wanted to have hookah. Couldn't have hookah. Why? They were taking 45mins to 1 hr to serve hookah at each table. Ordered a Kitkat Shake and A Club Sandwitch with French Fries and Coleslaw. It took more than 35 mins and constant following up to get our food. The shake was average. The sandwich however ws nice. They exhausted french fries so they put Nachos instead. The coleslaw was nicely made, and the sandwich was also good and filling. Nevertheless the extremely slow service did upset quite a few guests out there apart from me, and many infact left without having anything there. I wish they buck up and improve..its a new place, and a nice one..so you must visit the place atleast once for its ambience.
Ambience- 5/5
Food- 4/5
Service- NEGATIVE.
Here's wishing the What's Up team good luck, and I sincerely hope they improve on their services, because the place is definitely an amazing one.

The entrance to this place is sad  as its in a old office building!! But once you enter you totally forget about the entrance.

The place is really well done up. Very different for the usual hookah joint. Amazing views from there.

The food is average. It needs alot of improvement. But its newly opened and looks like they will be able to improve it. 

Hookah is good. 

The usp of this place will be the location and the pricing. 

Want to try a new places bored of going to usual old ones, then this ones a must try

Awesome ambience for different moods .... lip smacking food ... The best part is you can enjoy your hookah sitting in a foot Jacuzzi, while enjoying a panoramic view of the south Kolkata skyline!!! A must visit....

A very new and nice concept. Nice location. Easy parking available. Located on the 6th floor above Indhtalia.
Good ambience with warm reception by the friendly staffs. Outside sitting is amazing. The best thing is you can enjoy your hookah sitting in a jaccuzi. Amazing range of foods available made to the utmost perfection. Hookah was quite nice too. Prices are kept quite reasonable. Overall a perfect place to hang out with friends.

A fabulous cocktail of a welcoming ambiance, cordial staff, friendly owners, and great food. Scampi Gamberi,  Chicken Roulade and Torde de Polo are a Must try for the non vegetarians while dishes like Some Tam( crunchy papaya salad) , Veg Casserole and Roasted Pumpkin Bisque soup will be a Vegetarian's delight. But what makes this place stand out is the ambiance. A terrace view which offers an unadulterated view of the south kolkata skyline is something you would perhaps not see much or if at all anywhere else in the city. The jacuzzi on thevterrace deserves a special mention. Go check it out yourself. You may want to keep going back.

First day of this place.
Location was easy to find.
Rooftop place and roofed sections too. Amazing innovative interiors.
Various sections. Jacuzzi.
Changing lights. Soft music.
Very friendly owners. Their staff, cordial.
Hookah was average, could be better, which I'm sure they would work on.
Food was yum. 
Overall, a must visit.
Best time to go would be evenings. Though, day time you can chill in either of the internal section also.

All the very best, "What'sup" ! :)

Awesome place to visit! Loved the food, ambience.. Everyone should try papaya salad... Can be a perfect destination to hangout with friends! If you are wearing shorts, then pool side is the right place for you.
