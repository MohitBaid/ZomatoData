Have had Chicken Tandoori from here many a times ... just cant comapre with anywhere else. "paisa wasool" would be the perfect phrase to describe the food at this place

My favourite place for rolls and chicken tikkas since childhood.
Best for takeaways as they donot have any seating arrangements.
Its pocket friendly too.

Very economical joint serving decent food.... No seating arrangements available so take away is the only respite..... try the Chicken Shawarma along with the Dahi Kebab....

This fast food centre is located at Topsia , which mainly sells kebabs & rolls of various types.
Ambience, decor is average.
No sitting arrangements, which must be looked upon.
Quick delivery & nice staffs.
Food is delectable , especially the kebabs and pocket pinch is  less.
Overall a nice experience.

Mostly popular for their Kebabs, this place lacks on ambiance and decor. Their Kebabs are quite good, and usually proves value for money. Decent service, the sitting option is something though, which needs to be worked upon.

Fast bite is a usual fast food joint for mainly take away. I remember this place because  on durga puja season we stopped here to get some quick chicken rolls along with some kebabs which were decent in taste and quite quickly delivered to us which I liked. Taste was average and a bit too oily as well.

Tried their chicken roll today .. The paratha was crispy & hot .. Amount of chicken was average .. Loved the juiciness of it though .. Liked their prompt service .. On the downside - forget seating arrangement you actually have to eat your food standing on the adjacent foodpath .. :(

Come here for a short halt and pick the freshest kebabs. I have been quite friendly with the guys here, and they know what they opened the shop for. I truly admire their egg roll, as they emphasize on its quality as well. Most shops ignore the smaller dishes, but not here. The chicken roll, a lovey after Arsalan. Please try their tangri kebab...3 leg piece kebabs for a mere 140, after the taste...its well worth it. All their kebabs are nicely done. I would ask you to try this joint some odd day and relive wonderful food.

It is a fast food type restaurant.there is no place to sit.you have to order and wait.most people come here for take away.i went with my family there,we went in car so we parked the car in front of the fast food center. we ordered chicken tangri,hariyali kebab,chicken tikka kebab,chicken reshmi kebab,chicken tandoori,chicken reshmi tangri.i know its a lot of food but we were around 10 people.i will quickly classify my experience in cons and pros...........

pros-the food was amazing
          all the kebabs were very juicy and cooked to perfection.
          they serve it with chitney and salad;-))))(well its a pro for me)
           service was very quick
cons-only it should have a seating arrangement.that.s it.....nothing else
