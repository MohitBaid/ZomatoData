If you are looking for ice creams to soothe your soul. This is the place for you. The ice creams here actually has a lot of pulp of the fruit and the taste is very natural. This place is a must try and you can have kulfis like jamum, lichee, mixed fruit, imli, and mango.

Quite pathetic to say the least. Having a shop in a huge establishment like quest doesn't give you the right to make a mockery out of your customers. Your packaging is ridiculous, your quantity worse. Quite honestly I am a little flabbergasted and am kicking myself for not checking your rating before ordering which at a paltry 2.9 seems to be generous.

I visited this Kulfiano outlet at Quest mall as I had heard a lot about it from a couple of friends. We tried its chiku kulfi....it was quite ok but the ones that we get at local kulfiwalas are far better in taste. I won't say it's not worth trying. But it failed to impress me. The taste is average nothing extraordinary....
