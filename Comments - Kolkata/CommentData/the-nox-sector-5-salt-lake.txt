A little in the interior of the Pantaloons building, this is a place for youngsters who want hookah and  budget-friendly dishes. I had gone in specifically for food and I wasn't disappointed. Barbecued roesti with cheese and salsa, mixed sauce pasta with garlic bread, American corn with salt and pepper, Cadbury waffles with ice-cream, Cadbury and Oreo shake and Redbull🤗

The place is really nice just above Pour House. The food is really good and the quantity is good. Shisha is nice too. We had odered nutella , brownie, kitkat shakes, coffee. The pizza is also very cheesy and tasty. The sizzler paneer chilly and chilly garlic noodles are really tasty. Overall we had a good time. The cafe is nice and easy on pocket. Will visit again soon :)

I found this place good.The food is also good, Hookah is also good.Board games are also available there.Best thing is there Neon Lighting so don't forget to wear white coloured clothes
No Non-Veg is available there which might upset some people

A newly opened cafe in town located above Pantaloons on 2nd floor in sector 5. Been here multiple times and they didnt fail to impress me each time. The interiors are beautifully done and gives a nice feeling of warmth and comfort from the moment you enter the cafe. The ambience is amazing with@ nice music and they also have a big projector. They have a private room as well where you can celebrate birthdays or have a good time with friends and family. Coming to food and drinks all the items that we ordered were delicious. Hookah was smooth with dense smoke. Overall we enjoy a lot every time we visit here.

Been here twice. Lastly visited with bunch of friends. Located above Pantaloons, Sector V. Ambience is soothing. Staffs are friendly and courteous. Music is good, i loved it. Service was fast. Combo are attractive, but you can use it only once. The circle glasses in the ambience its the same concept from Cafe 360 degree, Saltlake city. Comfortable seat. We had ordered for :
☆ Chinese Sizzler🍝
☆ American corn salt and pepper 
☆ Crispy Chilli Potato (Spicy🌶)
☆ Masala Chips
☆ Waffle (not at all worth)
☆ Strawberry Mojito🍓
☆ Green Apple Mojit 🍏
☆ Brownie Shake ( didn't made it properly)
☆ Nutella Shake
☆ Pan Mojito 🍸
☆ Virgin Mojito 🍹
☆ Shisha 
☆ Family Garlic Bread🍞
The food were tasty, yummy🤓 and delicious. The quantity and quality was good. But some items dissapointed us. Overall experience was good.
 They too charge *service charge* in the bill, kindly check it out. We have a right of not paying any service charge as per government rules.

This was my 1st visit to 'NOX'. The ambience was gr8, seat arrangements were also amazing with calling bells, staffs r friendly & service is also fantastic..
We had baked cottage cheese balls in starter which were truly mesmerizing & delicious 😋 😋 And then comes d main course in wich we took Pizza which was not so tasty,  somewhere it was extra baked and somewhere it wasn't, it was widout cheese..  Not evn the accurate cheese wich should be dere..  So it was quite hard in eating wich annoyed us vry much at d end of our meal. 
But Nox Special Mocktail & Oreo Shake which we had in drink was yummy.. 
Nox special Mocktail is somewhat congruous to Gola, i.e. crusher of ice + choice of 3 Mocktail flavour.. I lyked dat.. ☺ 😋 
Hookah was as usual gud in compare to other cafes, one thing wich I lyked in hookah dat quite many flavours were available dere..  
Overall experience was good,  it could b Best if pizza would not disappointed us..

A new place in town. 
This cafe is in Sector 5 located on the 2nd floor of the Pantaloons building. It’s a little hard to find if you don’t know the location. 
This was my first visit and tbh i didn’t expect much from it but they surprised me. The interior is pretty okay. The glasses on the wall reminded me of Cafe 360 Salt Lake. 
We ordered Babycorn , Schezwan noodles and Shisha. The food was good and the first coal of the shisha lasted for around 50 mins. 
The best part about it is that it’s very pocket friendly. Our bill was around 800 which is pretty less compared to other cafes.
You can give it a try.

I visited this hookah joint after shift to relax . Over all it's a fool placed with a bit different sitting style of slouching couches . The food was good and our foremost intension was to have hookah which made my night . However the song's selection was just gross hence I have deducted one point for it , it's very important to understand what kind of music to play at the end of the night . So I would advise to look up this point. We had ordered 2 hookah which was great and I had a lot of smoke to puff , one margerita pizza and a paneer sizzler  , over all the food was yummy . But the pizza could be made a bit better and unfortunately it was a veg cafe so could not order much as I'm strictly non vegetarian . Would love if they could infuse some more flavours so that the hungry souls can be tummy fulfilled .

It's located on the 2nd floor above pantaloons in Megatherm building.At first,we thought that it won't be a nice place because of it's vicinity as a lot of work was going on near it but I was proved wrong.We ordered 5 topping pizza and babycorn.The babycorn was very delicious.The ambience was ok ok.The quantity was enough according to the price.Out and out,a nice place.

Loved the food. Cottage cheese appetizer were crazy. Also baby corn was excellent! Very crispy. Very different. Also the pasta was yummilicious. Good hukkah too! Ambience was a little down... But I guess that's because it's new and not many people know of it yet. Otherwise great!

The ambience was really crazy. Went and sat in the private area (big enough for a group of 7-9) and had a crazy time. Food was really yummy, specially the white sauce pasta. The hookah base looked really classy, and the shisha was well prepared too. Too far from a pocket pincher. Would surely visit more often now.

Tried out this new place in sector 5, and had a great experience!
Ambiance is well decorated and has the perfect amount of lighting, comfortable seating (cushions would be good) and music (volume is not too loud, which is good).
Shisha : got 2, both were well made and the staff fixed any issues we had.
Food : ordered 3 dishes. All were very good, especially the biryani!
Price : everything was very reasonable.
Service : all the staff were very friendly and took good care.
Great first experience, hope they keep it up!
