This is a very small outlet at bosepukur kasba ...but if you crave for good Chinese food , sitting at ur home..must order from China bite.. U can place order through swiggy too. Very delicious food , spicy. Main course of fried rice nd noodles is enough for 2 people as per quantity. I hv tasted Cantonese chicken noodles, ginger capsicum chicken fried rice, veg rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce, pan fried momo, dragon chicken.. All dishes were yummy..never disappoints me...

This is a small (blink-and-you-will-miss-it) outlet located near Talbagan Stoppage, Kasba. As the name implies, they deal in Chicken Cuisine. It is basically a takeaway outlet. I ordered their Shredded Chicken in Chilli Garlic via Zomato. Surprisedly, there was an authentic Chinese taste to the dish. The quantity was good and so was the gravy. Reasonable price too. If you are having cravings for Chinese with a light pocket, this place is a good suggestion for people who live nearby.

A take away outlet located at Kasba. I never thought that owing to the name of the land of Chinese cuisine, how horrible the food can be! We ordered food from here n all of them were so spicy that we literally had to waste the food..!! We ordered 
#drums_of_heaven
#chilli_honey_chicken
#Mixed_rice
#Mixed_noodles
Except the rice n noodles rest of the items were madly spicy that we suffered from stomach ache n had to consume medicines! An advice to the cook that please know the right quantity of spices u r using in ur dish! If required please go ahead to taste the dish before serving. 

I personally would not recommend anybody to order food from here if ur conscious about ur health..!

It is a local food joint near my residence. A 'take away' kind of.
Initially it used to be superb like all other good joints. But of late they have become quite unprofessional in preparing the dishes. Also while billing the food items.
Maybe this happened with me only as they had fixed an irrelevant amount for the food which wasn't matching with their own list. I was taken aback. 
Coming to the food now ,it was tasty and quite filling. Quantity was good!

A couple of days back was vacillating about getting myself some food delivered when I chanced upon this place. So decided to give it a go.

The fellow taking the order was helpful and so was the prompt service.
I had requested for chicken lung fung soup which was adequately cooked and an write confident the other soups would be good. Though I am a bit disappointed with their drums of heaven which was heavily fried in oil and then a sweat greasy juicy ketchup added to it making it a disaster. Well at least to me. Am sure there are many patrons who like it this way.

I wouldn't mind trying out again since my intuition tells me that I should stay clear from the fried items.

Located next to Bosepukur petrol pump, China Bite is indeed a saviour for Chinese lovers residing in Kasba. This is basically a small, takeaway counter. I had made a takeaway of chicken pan fried momo, hakka noodles and mayo garlic fish. The momo was nice, large in size and the sauce used was quite spicy ! The mayo garlic fish was good but the noodles were just ordinary. Overall, one can try this place for once

The small takeaway joint opposite the Kasba bosepukur petrol pump is a place with good quality Chinese food which is so very easy on the pockets. The momos are worth mentioning for their taste, size and quantity. Though it's quality is quite inconsistent at times. The noodles and every chicken prep is very nice taste wise and quantity wise. Apt home delivery makes this place even better.

Want Kolkata styled Chinese and are too lazy to step out of the comfort of your home? Then this is the  place to be. It's basically a take away joint. My friend lives in very close proximity of this place and thus one evening when we ended up chilling at her place, she ordered food from here. The pan fried momos tasted brilliant, the drums of heaven and chilli baby corn was decent as well. The service was quick and on my way back home as I peeped out to see the place, I had serious concern regarding the hygiene. :|

This place has been long on my wishlist. 
Last night suddenly I felt the cravings for Chinese food. 
So me and my wife went there at 10PM. 
The place is walking distance from my place. 
Firstly it is a take away joint do not have dine in facility. The place is small, and moderately hygienic . They have chairs on footpath and have plastic stools for serving the foods. 
Since it was late night and that's too on a week days. The place was almost about to close. 
We ordered the drums of heaven. 
Comes in 8 piece a plate for Rs. 160. 
The size was mixed with few large prices of drumsticks and others as average. The sauce it was tossed in was well seasoned and tasted good. But my wife found one of her drumsticks filled with excess of corn flour. Overall the taste was good but not exceptional. 
After eating the drumsticks we were feeling full so we packed our next orders. 
Mongolian rice. 
Hong Kong chicken 

They didn't take any container charges. 
The quantity is enough for two people. 
Mixed Mongolian rice was a hybrid of rice and noodles with chicken ,egg ,prawn . Seasoned well. Have an exceptional taste. A must try second time. 

Hong Kong chicken was nice, 8 solid pieces of boneless chicken. Well seasoned well cooked. But not that spicy , which was promised to us by the manager. Anyway the quantity was good.

Had feeling dinner for Rs.460 for two. 
I feel price is bit on the higher side since its a take away.

Its just a roadside food stall. Can't talk about its hygienic appeal or decor or food packaging as there is nothing to say about all these.
I only resort to their chicken panfried momos when I am left with no other option as they give 8 proper-sized momos in 100/-
I tasted their steamed momos once but it wasn't good . The panfried momos taste yummy always.
Its worth a shot, especially when you compare the price & quantity.

ordered one plate on chicken momo to start off with...well..for 80 bucks the quantity is good. adequate stuffing of chicken inside but the outer covering was over steamed resulting in a mushy floury dough in the mouth. the broth served alongwith had no flavor as it lacked in proper seasoning. the dip was normal ketchup mixed with chopped garlic..it should have been spicy...didnt order anything else for take away which i intended to do initially..overall it was sort of ok...momo is a very delicate dish which most chinese outlets make with chinese twists...quite obviously the outcome is horrible..since it belongs to nepal/tibet..one should visit a good tibetan restaurant for quality momo.

China Bite is literally a stone’s throw away from my place of work – so when I crave grease and soy, I end up picking food from here. Except one occasion where the food was very salty, everything has been pretty decent. I especially liked their soups. Overall, a standard Kolkata-chinese eatery, though the food is pretty good in the category.

Unfortunately experiences were not so pleasing for us trying out China Bite foods, giving them any rank atall. It is a take away counter, known to be an average outlet, from where we ordered home delivery on a few occasions trying out Chinese foods and chicken Momo, Last few experiences was horrible, when we ordered a regular side dish of Chicken with mushroom wz babycorn, that comes on white sauce universally known (non spicy), item my old parents like it, they prepared it on a red sauce which was awfully spicy/hot which we could not eat. Shocked we returned the food with a complaint note to their shop! 

Later, on last evening we ordered few plates of momo for our guests at home. First, momos given to us was all melted and smelly, which were actually rotten. We returned them then n there requested to replace or change them with other item. The shopkeeper assured to replace them with fresh lot of momo, showing excuse that the earlier ones got bit extra boiled, that's how it melted. But actually the momo were rotten, smelling awful that we told him. While the same stuff repeated when they replaced the momo which was again tasted sour and spoilt, same time spoiling the customers' money and their own goodwill. Later we returned the whole lot and not been compensated or replaced on lieu of retaining courtesy or good image. This was not expected by a consumer.

It's a takeaway joint in Kasba area. Had heard about it a lot and finally brought home egg schezwan fried rice, babycorn gravy and chilli chicken . The schezwan rice was so-so, the babycorn were just bland, not even fried properly and lacking that yumminess which babycorn is famous for. Although the gravy it was in was quite palatable. The chicken pieces were soft and well made , but the gravy was too runny and insipid, neither salted , nor spicy. Quantity was good but quality not good enough.

I guess not many people living outside kasba area are aware of this restaurant. Its not like hatari , chowman or bigboss. It does not have the popularity it deserves. However what i am sure of is that you will not be disappointed. The quantity of the food as well as the quality as such a low price is an utter delight which makes you want to go order from this place again and again. Shanghai Chicken and the Szechuan Rice is a must try. You'd love their Fried or steamed momos. Consistent quality. Home delivery is always a better option because there are only a couple of chairs. Its basically an amazing indochinese take away place you'd want to order from again and again. Seriously, do try their Shanghai Chicken.

It is an okay place for home delivery as there are only a few chairs kept on the pavement where the outlet is located. So, to sit and have a meal is not advisable unless there is no option.

The menu has a lot to offer but we have pretty much stuck to ordering Fried Rice(Veg/Chicken) and Chilli Chicken(Gravy) which are decent.Although, recently on one occasion we walked and ordered for a Chilli Chicken as we were in a hurry. When we reached home, we realised that they have parceled a Dry Chilli Chicken without checking with us(even we forgot to specify while ordering though they should have checked with us before proceeding).

On rare occasions I have ordered vegeterian items such as Chilli Mushroom but was disappointed because the mushrooms or the vegetables have a thick coating of flour before being deep fried and then added to the gravy which is not palatable at all.

You have to come here after the renovation of not just the whole joint but also in the food which has become all the more yummy! And it just doesnt stop there, now the latest addition to China Bites portfolio is that they are serving rolls! and they are yummy too....you shud try it, taste is at par or if not better than the joints around and when you compare the price you will be on for a more yummy treat! Food in general has always been good, but when it becomes better, thats where it becomes a regular and favorite place to go and make your stomach happy! Go on have a awesome time making your tummy feel happy as well as your heart!

On a rainy afternoon, when I was so desperately looking for some spicy stuff, I found this place and let me tell u that if you are looking for real spicy noodles (that has no resemblance with authentic chinese noodles) cooked in black sauce and with so much masala, this is the place u should visit..It was the exact thing I wanted on that lazy wet afternoon..Price is definitely on a lower side..Fried Chicken is another super spicy dish one must try..

Now what could I say about China Bite? 

If you can care to look beyond the pseudo-chino decor, the deafening noise of the traffic behind you, the general lack of hygiene and the greasy, rather uncomfortable chairs precariously placed on a slab of concrete (?) in a hilarious compromise for a seating arrangement, - it's a GREAT little joint for cheap yet tasty Chinese (and Tibetan) cuisine.

I have ordered food here on a couple of occasions in the past and was pleasantly surprised every time by their quick delivery, the good taste of their food and their very competitive pricing. My only concern was (and still is) that probably use MSG (monosodium glutamate, or 'Ajino-moto', as it is popularly referred as) as a taste enhancer on food meant for delivery.

But yes, China Bite rocks for the taste of their Chinese food. It's not very authentic, but very 'Calcuttan'. I mean, that peculiar mix of strong flavors, 'Tangra'-esque aroma, satisfying volume, greasy looks and cheap-sauced affairs that have come to be associated with Chinese cuisine in Kolkata.

Last but not the least, try out their steamed momos someday. 

Served at 8 pieces per plate, with a larger-than-your-average-roadside-bowl of soup and a mouth-tingling dip, you can have a very satisfying Tibetan treat at just Rs. 80.00. 

And a look at the size of the momos will prove that the price is worth every paise. They are sumptuously big, with a thin wrapping and a very solid filling. 

Try them now and thank me later!

This is my favorite road side Chinese eatery in Bosepukur, Kasba. They serve value for money. The quality of the food is very fresh, very delicious and the quantity is very good.
The momo,fries, fried rice, meat and fish preparations, everything is simply yummy!
The staff is well-behaved and helpful.
Now they have expanded to Indian cuisine as well with a limited menu. The Indian is good. However it could be improved a little more.

I would recommend this small eatery to everyone.

I have been eating from China Bite since 2011 and I recommend this place for Chinese cuisine. Though I've never been to the place and always got home delivered I would love to visit the place too.
I've tried Cantonese noodles and  Singapore noodles. Both are a bit spicy and oily but I love the taste. They provide basamati rice for the fried rice which is again very good to get in such highly reasonable price. In side dishes, kung pao chicken, lat ma kai chicken and red pepper chicken are my favourite. You may also try chicken sweet and sour, Munchurian chicken and chilly fish.  The prices are low and the joint does justice to the ingredients. 

As I always got home delivered, I don't have much idea about the restaurant but all I can say is it's good to get home delivered when your food is on speed delivery. The charge very less for the containers and have friendly gesture towards their customers. 

I am dying to go back to China bite. See you ! :)

A small road side eatery at kasba. But this place very famous among the locals, especially for home delivery. Only bad thing is, they take a long time to deliver. Other wise the food is lovely. Love their momos and sezwan rice. All love their north indian preparations.

Well I had ordered their china bites special fish.
8 pieces of fishes were given for Rs 160.
I must say that the fish quantity in each was much more than you would expect  and it was very fresh. Yes they use Basa fish only but the preparation was very good. It was bit spicy with Chiili Flakes on top and tossed in red sauce I guess with loads of shallow fried onion on it. The taste was good, only they could have avoided so much onions. Recently I tried out drums of heaven and the dish was simply yummy. The chicken lollypops were tossed in sauce and the taste was good.
Service is prompt and nicely packed so that they remain hot till a longer period.

Wanted to taste the chilli lamb but was not available.

This is mainly a take away food joint near bosepukur.This place offers good food at very cheap price and the food tastes awesome.The food is delivered within 45mins of  the order given or even less than that.The dishes that deserves special mention are pan fried momo,kungpao chicken,devil's chicken,hong  kong rice.Recently they have have added a new tandoori and indian section.This section is not as good as the chinese section but there are some dishes in indian section that are really good.Those are chicken tadka,egg tadka,masala kulcha,chana,stuffed nun.They offer good quality food at cheapest price.

This is a small take away joint  where one can drop in for a budget friendly Parcel. I have crossed this place innumerous times but never really had the opportunity to order or stop by to pick up a quick parcel. Its a general tendency to overlook the restaurants near your home. But anyways since my mum is a hard core chinese food lover, one fine day i decided to order in few  items just to taste and see how it serves. 

I ordered the dragon chicken and the schezwan chicken. Thay claimed that the dragon chicken will be very spicy but hell NO. It tasted nice, had peanuts and veggies but SPICY was a term wrongly used to define the dish. SO i would say it did not meet my standards. Next the schezwaan too was not at all spicy and some how it had way too high Bengali touch . If you are craving authentic chinese, this place is a total disaster. I would suggest Hungree rather. The place is perfect for those who avoids spicy food.

But yes very pocket friendly and prompt delivery.

Ordered a plate of Steamed Momo.
8pcs Cost Rs 80. The quantity and taste is Value for money. The Soup is an egg soup and not chicken , unlike other chinese joints. The soup is very dilute but the momos were stuffed very well and tasted good.

16th August,2014
Sufficient quantity,awesome quality,quick and good ambiance. Keeping aside that they don't have Indoor Dine-in. The food took my mind away.Awesome fried rice(they gave egg nd chicken in chicken fried rice,when there is a separate dish at a higher price),chilli chicken was palatable. Got good comments from my friends thus tried it out. and the prices were cheap too.Tough competition to Hungree I would say. Their home delivery is better as well. Expected more in quantity as being school students and limited pocket money and savings.

Visited this outlet again on 21st April,2015, because my favourite More-Value for money restaurants were under renovation. ordered,

 Again, it had rained the same evening, the seats outside were dusty and they did not even care to clean it up. This restaurant has no ambiance , just a few seats outside still broken, hectic during summer. In the evening, you will face difficulties in placing order because the attendant is too busy taking phone calls. They are too cheap minded to provide 2 counters for taking order, 1 home delivery and takeaway/ dine-in for the other. Feast restaurant nearby ran out of chicken.

1. 1 Pan Fried Chicken Momo (8/10)

2. 1 Mixed F. Rice

(6/10)

3. 1 Chicken F. Rice

(7/10)

4. Chilli Chicken(8/10)

5. Ambiance-'read above' (6/10)

the average comes upto 7/10 ~ 3.5/5

 NO SAUCE SACHETS PROVIDED.

            Pan fried momos had 8 pcs and were great in taste but the skin of all the momos were not consistent, the thick ones had the taste of raw maida+atta, some were thick on one side.. the thin ones were great.

             Mixed F. Rice has average in taste, the prawn had a bad smell, as if not well cooked properly/old stuff. They always served average quantity(check my old review), which was never filling for me. They put too less of the eggs/chicken/prawn in their rice.. My fav restaurants in Picnic garden gives premium taste compared to this joint, at Rs. 10 less.

                Chicken F. Rice has the same chicken-less problem and the average quantity. Still tasted better as it did not have prawns to carry that uncooked smell. Chilli Chicken tasted good, it carried 8 pcs, but they provided much less gravy! Small container was provided with 8 pcs , leaving out almost no space for much gravy, but tasted good.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW AND LIKE IT TOO, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT, BUT AGAIN, JUST LIKE I'VE SHARE EXPERIENCES OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT, MANY HAVEN'T TRIED THERE AS A RESULT THEY MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT JUDGEMENT FOR THE QUANTITY AND TASTE. READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE PUTTING IN YOUR MONEY

Today I went to this place to order some food for the first time, it is basically a take away food joint. It is located beside bosepukur sitola mandir. I ordered 2 plate mixed Hakka chow, 1plate dry chilli chicken & 1 plate fried momo, which were enough for four of us, by this you can understand they provide ample quantity. I must say The food was really very tasty, the chow was good with plenty of fried chicken & egg but the momos and the dry chilli chicken was awesome. I am quite satisisfied with my first experience.

Nowadays many roadside eateries have sprung up in several parts of kolkata and this one is not an exception .... the eatery has recently gone through a transformation..in good light..offcourse..and have added several things in the menu...like Indian, tandoori &mughlai stuffs..among the snacks their most popular is drums of heaven & chicken lollipop..which is quite good.. they also have many varieties of soups,rice,noodles and veg stuffs not to say the least and the Indian stuffs also consists of many variations  .Besides that home delivery is available in 3 km radius which is good..and it is fast..so in total being a roadside eatery mainly it is a good combo of good food,fast delivery & varieties..and nowadays dine in is also available so in my review u can definitely check it out once.

As they all say big things comes in small packages... This place can serve as an appropriate example. A  little outlet on the street of kasba is an ideal place for a quick takeaway or home delivery. Surprising factor is the food. Have to say it was quite cool.. 1. Golden Fried Prawn was fantastic 2. Kum Pao Chicken was a real delight. 3. Mayo Garlic Fish was also great.
To sum up... It was a pleasing experience and look forward for another venture soon.

This little Shop is quite the ideal thing when you need a quick delivery of food for unannounced guests! Serving traditional "Bengali" Chinese, they have recently added Mughlai items to their menu, they dish up some really good items which are decently priced and the quantity too is very satisfactory. Two mains and two sides can sufficiently feed a group of four. Especially good is their Kung Pao Fish. Reception and service are also quite good. They had forgotten one of the dishes we ordered and even though we discovered this oversight almost an hour after delivery, a simple phone call was enough and our missing food arrived even before we could sit down for our meal!

Tried the Chinese chopsuey from this chinese joint near Bosepukur.No complaints on food and service but the quantity could have been a bit more considering the price(Price was-140rs).
Another chinese take away joint near golpark offers more quantity at less price.
Still, no complaints on taste and am eager to try out other stuff from here.

The menu here on Zomato is outdated probably.

Kolkata, nowadays is getting filled with roadside chinese eateries.
This one is not an exception. It is located on the opposite footpath of the Petrol Pump in Bosepukur and is quite popular for their chinese dishes..
On a rainy day, we decided to order from this place.

[NOTE :They take a good amount of time to deliver when it is raining outside.]

Food we ordered :-
1) Hot and sour soup : Too spicy. Good for you if you are suffering from cough and cold. Helps. Not only that, it tastes good too, if you can tolerate spiciness.

2) Crispy chilly babycorn : Not at all crispy. It was kind of soggy. Please avoid this.

3) China bite special chicken : This was recommended by the person who was taking the order. This was indeed a delicious dish. 6 big pieces of slight crispy chicken fried and tosed in a sauce which had a bit of a sweet taste adding a kick to the dish. I actually loved this dish.

4) Mixed Friedrice : This was an above average dish. Good amount of chicken, eggs and prawns but a bit bland in taste.

5) Mixed hakka noodles : This was really good.

6) Hunan Chicken : Well prepared. Tasted good.

7) Chilli Fish : Above average.

8) Kung pao chicken : Liked it. :)

Over all pocket pinch was around 900. (IF I AM NOT WRONG). Very reasonable.
We had ordered a plate of each.
Food quantity and quality, both are good.
A single plate is enough to suffice two people. :)

Happy eating.:D

This place is good when you want some really cheap food in large quantities. 
I had take out from here.  LATE. VERY VERY LATE. They are really slow in terms of delivery. Coming to the Food
We had Pepper Chicken, Singapore Noodles, Honey and chili chicken.
1. Quantity- Ample. It was a lot of food.
2. Taste- It tasted okay. Nothing outstanding.
 Now, the part that concerned me. Some Chicken was left over, the next day so I took it out of the fridge to warm it up when I took it out I noticed something weird. It had set. LIKE A CUSTARD. I realized it was filled with cornflour. Thus I just left it. 
As I said cheap option, not a good one.

I have visited the place quite often, right from the time they opened up but lately I have become dissatisfied with the way they take orders.This is not the first time I am referring to but the second time in a row where I had ordered Wok Tossed Prawn (gravy) but was delivered the dry variation even after having repeatedly confirmed that I need it to be gravy and not dry.The best part being the last time the person taking the order specifically asked me over the phone,yet prepared it dry.I feel this should get more carefully handled in future. Apart from this the Chicken fried rice tastes good and is adequately served.

First of all there was a delayed in delivery ..i got that at 10 Pm.  It will be considered....but when i open the food it was not noodles..one of the main dish given was rice.. My question is when you people are taking 25 rs service charge then why this type of service????? Its required to check the food ??? You are running a small branch and its very new..If this types of service you offered..you should not take service charges....please answer me...and please IMPROVE YOUR SERVICE......

I must say the reviews here are over hyped.Just getting hot food being delivered at my doorstep at right time cannot be a parameter,not at least to Bengali's. In that case Kim Woh is always late but still I die for their items and wait patiently.
Coming to China Bite,this place is very near to my house so I didn't take the trouble to trouble them with home delivery.I had actually went there thinking about going to Vesselka,but was surprised to find China Bites. Anyways I placed order thinking I would get some good proper Chinese dishes.Their Chicken Noodles had very little of chicken in it,chilli garlic pepper chicken is so-so with too much of pepper,Chicken Lollipop was fine but too much of cornflour,Singapore Rice Noodles...can never forget this dish,it was yellow in color and tasted...weird,would never ty it again.Till now I only found their Chicken Momo to be good.As you can find all the items were very regular Chinese dishes but tasted on the whole very average.Why should anyone waste money here instead of 'Hungry' or 'Kim Woh' or even 'Feast' I dont understand.Their location is prime and I guess that's the sole reason for so much of hype.

I am really hoping for them to increase their home delivery service speed.
It was a weekday and my family thought of eating Chinese food so we ordered from china bite at 6:00pm and told them to send the food whenever it was ready and it should arrive by latest 7:30pm.Our house was just opposite to Siemens building near narkel bagan bus stop which is 1km (approx). It was 7:30pm and food did not arrive so we waited for 15minutes but still food did not arrive. I called them and they told their delivery boy was at coming. Then we waited for another half and hour and we again called them and we told if they did not get the food in 10minutes then we would cancel and deny the order.so after 10 minutes they came and made excuses like there was only one delivery boy. Hopefully those guys who are reading this review would make a smart decision but their food is great though.

This is an update to my first review where I complained about the delivery time of the restaurant. Now I would like to add that I am frustrated with the delivery time of the restaurant and will think twice before ordering.

It was a fine weekday that I thought of ordering from China Bite, looking at previous experiences I ordered the food (for 2) at 12:30AM, when it was about 1hr from the time of order, I called them again to inquire about my delivery and they told me that the delivery boy has left with my food. Now let me remind you that my house is just opposite to Simens Office on the main road (R.B. Connector) which is probably just 1km from the restaurant. After 3 calls, finally the delivery boy reached with the cold food at 2:30PM (2hrs from delivery time). He claimed his innocence by telling me that the restaurant did not told him that when I wanted the food to be delivered whereas I told them to send the food as soon as they can. He also told me that he had 4 deliveries near Ballygunge side, now what was he doing there. I mean how can he go Ballygunge first which is just opposite direction from the restaurant. They should have given the orders for Ballygunge to some other delivery boy and the orders till Ruby Hospital to some other. If this sort of delay continues then I might stop ordering from this restaurant though I like the food so much.


----- 08 Sep, 2013 -----

This is a newly opened restaurant and I recently ordered from them after reading many Zomato reviews. I must say that the food is very good considering the size of the restaurant. The taste of the food is very fine and budget friendly. Cost for 2 persons would be around Rs.350 - 400. The menu is good and consists of many Chinese dishes.

The cons of this restaurant would be the delivery time, I was delivered the food after 1.5 hrs as the delivery boy was not told the address properly (or so he claimed) and he was new to the locality, then also my house is just about 2 kms or so from the restaurant and that too on the main road, the delivery boy went to some lane and called me three times to get the food to the correct place.

Another con of this restaurant will be that there is very less space to sit and have the food. Considering the size of the restaurant, you would like to have your food delivered at your doorstep rather than going there to eat. Also decorations inside the restaurant are not that pleasing.

Ordered from here while staying with a friend at her place nearby, as she suggested that this place was quite nice, and not too expensive. Three of us, on a rainy afternoon, decided to call them up and order a couple of starters and chowmien, and a friend got herself a soup. The food arrived within 40 minutes of ordering, which was quite good, as my friend does not live very close by. I had a few tastes from the hot and sour soup we had ordered, and it was nicely spicy. The Chilli mushrooms were quite nice, but what we loved was the Lat Mei Kai which was very good. What disappointed was the Chicken Hakka Noodles which was too oily, and the quantity of chicken was too less in proportion to the noodles. But otherwise, the meal was decent.

the reviews in zomato have been too lavish regarding this restaurant and so i ordered a home delivery from them today.
their items were fresh and well cooked and they didn't press   any charge for containers or home delivery which was reassuring.
however the food isn't exemplary and i would describe it as a modicum for standard restaurant these days.i am no way berating them,they might be the ideal place to order chinese from on a lazy sunday.i am putting a itemwise description for convenience
mayo garlic fish-at rs 100,you get reasonably good amount of fish,well cooked and with a decent gravy
wok tossed prawn in butter garlic sauce-not bad,either.
mixed cantonese noodles-they amount of chicken was stupendous,probably because they ran out of shrimps,which was visibly difficult to find
kung pao chicken-impressive gravy and succulent pieces of chicken at 96

china bite style hot prawn-my pick of the day.very well made!

WE HAVE ORDERED FOOD FROM THIS . FOOD IS VERY GOOD......ON TIME SERVICE ....GO FOR IT


They make excellent veg and non veg starters. Some of their house bestsellers from the non veg starter section are chicken garlic pepper chicken, lat mei kai, and drums of heaven. They also make some very mean and authentic Thai red and green curry chicken and prawn dishes. Their specialty or signature dishes are also a great way to sample their cooking as well as to satiate your appetite. Try the following signature dishes: china bite styled fried chicken, fried fish, fried rice, hot prawns and lamb. Last night we ordered food. It was heavily raining.order was for 10pm. but we got the food SMOKING HOT on 9.45pm. Taste was good. Prawn was big in size and tasty too. Just giving 5 for serving tasty and hot food at our doorstep in a heavy raining night. Love it.

Well China Bite is located where Vesselka used to be a month or two back! It came up in no time, with bright glow sign and numerous foodies hovering around! It looks like a fast food joint, and well it IS a fast food joint! Anyway, fortunately it home delivers. I have home delivered several times and till now I have barely any complaints.
For the first time I had ordered for a Cantonese Chicken Noodles, which was quite impressive. The quantity and quality happened to be very good. Only, the noodle was a little bit oily! The gravy had generous amount of Chicken and mushrooms, along with babycorn, bell peppers etc! It was very light and heart warming, and pleasant for a hot summer's night. Next, I tried their regular Chicken fried rice as well as their China Bite Style Chicken fried rice- both were commendable taste-wise! Quantity again was good. However try to avoid the prawns they give in the China Bite style fried rice,they were suspiciously dirty and stained! Also for side orders you can try their Kung Pao Chicken, and sweet and sour chicken! If you dont mind your gravy being hot and spicy- do order Red Pepper chicken! Chicken haka noodles are good too. The Schezwan noodles, if i remember it correctly, has too many nuts in it! Álthough on the menu given here you will see spring roll and chicken wrap- they don't serve these yet!
I have not tried fish and lamb yet. However every time I have ordered (which is quite a few times I must say) I have been very satisfied with the food I received. It is always more than sufficient, and also very tasty.
I would suggest you to get your food home delivered if that is possible, since there is not any proper dining options. Or else if you are hungry and don't mind a roadside food corner, feel free to visit. Delivery is prompt, mention while ordering if you want the delivery guy to get change for you bill money!
The prices are reasonable. I do not know how they manage to put fresh and good quality ingredients at such low prices. Do try when possible. Good Chinese, at highly reasonable price! Have fun :)
They have started an Indian menu of which I have tried their Kashmir polao, and Chicken Cheese Kabab. Both are commendable.

I was very apprehensive when I decided to order food from here after seeing very mixed reviews. However its better to have the food and repent instead of not having at all so I decided to go for it. The order consisted of chicken hot and sour soup, mongolian and schezwan rice, red pepper lamb and garlic fish. Here are my observations:

Pros: 1. Very fast delivery
2. Excellent taste and quantity
3. Not very expensive

Cons:

1.Some prawns not cleaned leading to a sandy taste.
2. The rice could have had less oil

Overall a good experience and I will order again from here for sure.

This new joint is in  my locality & have ordered quite sometime from there.
I had ordered few different dishes, of which I experienced variety with respect to quality for different dishes.

The starters were really finger licking. But in the main course, noth the chicken hakka chow * chicken fried rice has excess oil which is very unusual for chinese dishes.
the garlic chicken also had more or less no salt added to it, which made it taste horrible.

Othersiwe packaging,quantity were all good.

Hello Soma (http://www.zomato.com/kolkata/china-bite-kasba/reviews?review_id=194655) If you can please look into the feedback for further improvement.

Nice food, good quantity n quality.
Liked the quality in the price range but the chilli lamb inspite of being asked to make spicy tasted sweet n the lamb pieces could have been a little more soft.

Hello Fellow Foodies,

A couple of days back I had gone to Kolkata for vacation and being a resident of Kasba I was keen in trying out this newly opened restaurant. Well I had gone there for take-out. Firstly I was very impressed with the menu as there were some off beat dishes. I ordered chicken meat balls and chicken steam momos. I was told by the lady who took the order to wait for 15 mins. I had some other work in the nearby area so I told her I will be back after 15 mins. It was 19th of May, a Sunday night. 

When I came back, needless to say after 20 mins, I found (after asking the lady for 10 more mins) that my order hasnt reached the kitchen yet! I do understand that its Sunday and there is rush bt after half an hour if any customer was in my position they would be highly disappointed as I was. 

Anyways I asked the lady and the man who took my coupon to prepare and deliver the food quickly. After waiting for 15 more minutes, the food came. As far as the food was concerned, I was quite taken by surprise. The chicken meatballs were good in proportion, all flavors cooked to perfection - meat was equally succulent. It was a treat! The momo was average. But the meatballs surely stole the show ! I was very happy and forgot about the late delivery.

The very next day, we planned to order for home delivery. This time we had ordered Cantonese chicken noodles, Chicken fried rice, Chicken meatballs and Chili Garlic Chicken. And my impression changed ! About the food:

1. The chicken meatballs which I had ordered the day before and the one I ordered on the next day seemed so DIFFERENT that I double checked to ensure I had ordered from the same place! The size of the meatballs were like small rasmalai's ! And the meat was dry..they were not shallow fried with any sauce and tasted like rubber. It was pathetic.

2. The Cantonese noodles portion was so less that it was not even sufficient for one person! The Chicken fried rice was just average.

3. The  Chili Garlic chicken had no chinese taste to it.. a

I felt not only cheated but terribly disappointed at the fact that how can they serve two completely different version of the same dish in two consecutive days !! 

I would like to say to Miss. Sneha Thapa ( http://www.zomato.com/users/sneha-thapa-762522)  who I believe is the admin of the restaurant that, I had a horrible experience at your joint. Not only that the cooks have no set recipe for one dish but also the lady who takes order during evening is not at all friendly and also there is a lot of mismanagement around! Hope you change for the better !

Wished to taste their food. looked inviting. But, oh my god! Their delivery system sucks, the guy (Raja) looked confused as if he was unraveling a genetic code. He was picking & choosing items from 5 different orders and issuing instructions to the kitchen staff. the result wwas a queue of waiting customers and a table full of half-complete orders. A bowl of soup took half an hour to hand over to a customer. 

And he had the gall to tell me that he is releasing the orders serially and their attitude said it all. They need to believe in the motto "customer is king", which they severely have lost track of.

Can't comment about their food, though, since I couldn't taste their food and neither have any wish to, in future. 

This happened  on Friday, 17.05.2013 at around 8.30 to 9.15. I had to walk away without the food, as the order for the side dishes were being issued to the kitchen staff after 45 mins.

NOT BITE SIZED FOOD! 

China Bite in Kasba is one of those food joints that will have a very long innings. They serve simply amazing food that is not only excellent in taste but value for money Chinese fare. The staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions. The food service is prompt and efficient. The food takes very little time to arrive from the kitchen to the tables. Their menu card is colorful and well written. Most importantly, all the items mentioned in the menu are available. 

Their fast food items like Momos, Chinese wrappers and combo meals are very popular among locals. A mention must be made of their very innovative but delicious corn spinach Momos - ideal for vegetarians. You can have them either fried or steamed or pan-fried. The sizes and portions of momos are meant to satiate any kind of stomach. This local establishment is best known for their awesome lamb preparations. Very few Chinese restaurants offer so many lamb preparations at such reasonable prices. Some of the juicy lamb dishes served by them that I had were chilli garlic lamb, lamb with pak choy, lamb in gumbo sauce and other equally tasty and well prepared lamb preparations. These can be had with just plain and simple steamed rice or their varied fried rice offerings. The quantity of fried rice and noodle items is generous and overwhelming if you are a poor eater. 

They make excellent veg and non veg starters. Some of their house bestsellers from the non veg starter section are chicken garlic pepper chicken, lat mei kai, and drums of heaven. They also make some very mean and authentic Thai red and green curry chicken and prawn dishes. Their specialty or signature dishes are also a great way to sample their cooking as well as to satiate your appetite. Try the following signature dishes: china bite styled fried chicken, fried fish, fried rice, hot prawns and lamb.

One word - Horrible 
in fact, the the delivery takes 2 hours in a place located close to Kasba, the delivery guy looks like he just got off a boat. All phone lines are always busy, and the food is inedible. 
The chicken tastes funny, maybe its stale, or maybe it isnt chicken at all. 
Horrendous food.. i rather go hungry than order food from here. 
No quality, No Service, i cant give 0 and so im giving it a 1 .

China Bite opened up recently in our locality which once boasted of pseudo Indo-chinese restaurants like Feast and Hungree. 
China Bite has brought about the refreshing change that the locality needed. With an a lot of variety to choose from, and with amazing quality, China Bite has made its mark.
It has just been days of its inception, but you can already see a plethora of eager mouths chomping on the variety of fare each time you pass by. 
The food is surpisingly delicious, quality is amazing and service is prompt. I personally go for home delivery and enjoy their fare within the comforts of my home. My persnoal favourites are Hakka Noodles, Cantonese Noodles and Green Pepper Chicken (You got to try this to feel it making love to your tongue).
The management is young and enthusiastic and probably this has helped this joint grow its customer base. Growing complacent and compromising on quality are the only things that can bring them down from the pedestral (hope this never happens)
Cheers to the team and hope they continue to grow and provide more joy and cheer to our taste buds..
