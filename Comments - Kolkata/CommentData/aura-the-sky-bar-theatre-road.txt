Very Poor Customer Service. I had a coupon from Bookmyshow which mentioned a 15% discount which they completely denied on providing. Even on calling the manager multiple times, he never made his appearance. Food is just about average. The only thing good about this place is the ambiance in the evening.

Great Food, Great Location, Great Ambience.
A must visit rooftop with music, pool, wines and a special lit seating arrangement.
Ordered for Basil fish and hot wings on fire with a orange flavoured hookah.
Food is so yummy but the hookah us average.
# A must visit again......

Really liked the ambience. It's a rooftop place, serves great Hookah and good ambience. If you are the kind who enjoys soft music and rooftop settings, this place will not disappoint you.

The ambience is very amusing as the seats are lit in the evening,and also the view is very beautiful from there.It can be a good place for hangout with friends or your loved ones as music is always on.
Food is considerably good.It is good for one time visit

Decor : Lovely rooftop view, pool by the side. Seats lit up at night and slow light music! Perfect ambience for me.

Food : ordered cocktails- LIIT & Old timers. Both were good! Though I preferred their old timer more which had this gandharaj taste. üòç
Chicken prep was also soft and juicy! Well prepared.

Billing : please be careful to check the whole bill before paying coz they did mix up dishes and later on refunded money for the stuff I didn't order! 

I enjoyed my time. Hope to visit again. (:

Only giving the points for the decent ambience and food. But the service simply ruined it. The drinks are served without the mixers. The mixer comes 5 later and my guest is just waiting. 2 of the same drink has been ordered - one comes before, and one 10 mins after (basically they didn't take the order right). We were a group of 15 guests with plates piling up and I personally had to call someone to clean it. Moreover, I wanted to pack some leftover pieces of the birthday cake and separately request 3 different people for a takeaway box. If you're running a rooftop lounge, you should really up your game to ensure people come back! Not too happy overall. The food and drinks were not below expectations but not fantastic either. Neither was the music out of this world.
