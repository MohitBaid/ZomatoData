I noticed this cafe in Sealdah station area while walking towards station from the bus stop and decided to have a quick snacks. Firstly the ambiance is very simple. It's actually hard to find a decent hygienic restaurant around the Sealdah station area but this place is comparatively clean. I kept my order very simple. My order included,
* Chicken Omlet
* Chicken Sandwich
* Cold coffee
All the foods tasted pretty good. Price was pocket friendly too. Only two things I have to say that their service must be quick and the place needed to be taken care about the hygiene a little bit more. Definitely recommended if you are damn hungry and can't able to find a proper place to sit and eat amidst the busy hustle and bustle in Sealdah area.

The lack of a decent cafe type restaurant in and around Sealdah area is very prominent. This restaurant is a good one. We visited this place few days ago. And i liked it. Decorations and ambiance was ordinary.... nothing fancy. But food was good. They offer continental, Chinese and south Indian. We ordered cold coffee, palin dosa and club sandwich. Dosa was paper thin and crispy.....sambar and coconut chutney was also very good. Sandwich was also awesome. My only complaint is against the coffee.....it wasn't very good. It was watery.....other than that it was a good experience.

Giving them 0.5 extra only because the guts they had shown till date to run a continental cuisine in the area like this... I tried their cold coffee with ice cream n chicken cutlet... Cold coffee was decent rather good but the cutlet needs enough improvement... Service was bit slow... Staffs are courteous... Décor n ambience is good enough as far the other options available nearby... Pocket pinch is moderate... I wish them a good luck for their future... O ha... They are serving, chinese n south Indian dishes too...

I found this place when I was hungry and tired after doing 7 hours of non-stop classes. The place is pretty sophisticated judging by the market place outside and the food is pretty good. The behaviour I get is also nice . A decent place to eat if you are in Sealdah and do not want to eat in the roadside restaurants

Could have never imagined that continental food is being served in Sealdah area until one of my friend who resides in the area brought me here. The cold cuts and salads are much appreciated by them. Since I am not a very healthy kinda foodie, I definitely had all the fried stuffs. The golden fried prawn was good. Loved the chicken and cheese omlette too and also the sandwiches. Really this place comes with some fresh air serving some different genre of food in this congested area of Sealdah. Happy Dining! :)

I was very shocked to find this restaurant near sealdah station, that too serving continental food.  After seeing the reviews I visited this place with my sister. We were the only one there and no one came also till the time we spent there ( which was a lot since they take a bit too long to serve the food). We ordered cream of chicken soup, roast chicken with capsicum rice and chicken tetrazini. The soup was good but not as creamy as the name suggests also they had added coriander leaves which to my knowledge one is not supposed to add in the cream of chicken soup but it tasted alright. Service time is too much, most probably because they don't get that much of customers hence the speed is slow. After the soup got over we waited for 25 minutes or so for the mains to arrive. The tetrazini was really good and cheesy with right amount of everything to it but the roast chicken was too salty. As in the gravy they had made which covered the chicken. And the chickens were not roasted and served with gravy but cooked together in gravy( I hope I could explain the difference)
Because of slow service and not keeping salt and pepper ( forget oregano, chili flakes ( although they should as they say it is a continental restaurant) the area being sealdah) on the table I am giving 3 and not 3.5

Considering the dearth of good cafes or restaurants in this area, i was surprised to find a Continental listing called Station Cafe.
   The place itself is a bit hard to find. You cannot reach there by car. If you do you will have to park a good distance away. If you are walking from Rajabajar towards Moulali this place is located on your right underneath the sealdah flyover in The United Bank of India building. 
    We went in the evening and had to wade through crowded streets to reach this place. The place was empty but the staff were pretty helpful. The interior is not that great. Just utilitarian. I would suggest sitting on the 1st floor as the kitchen opens on to the ground floor. 
    They had an extensive menu but half the things were not available; so we asked the waiter what we should go for. We ended up ordering Fish Fry, Grilled Fish and Special Lassi. The order was served quickly.
    I had minimum expectations for the fod but i was proved wrong. The grilled fish was brilliantly done with freshly marinated fish below and a sumptuous spread of cheese and mayonnaise above. It had been baked to perfection. The fish fry, although thin was also really tasty. One of the better fish fries of the city. The special lassi failed to excite though.
    I would have rated this place better if only the interiors were good and the place was easy to locate. But definitely I am going back just for the food.

Honestly speaking, Sealdah is too downmarket a place to even think of a continental cuisine restaurant. So when I came across this restaurant opening up few months back beside the flyover on my way home through Sealdah station, I was pleasantly surprised. In fact it was no short of a culture shock. The place is known for a variety of cheap food available on the street and in some no-frills eateries. There is no good restaurant around, even a small and decent dine-in place for Bengali’s favourite cuisines- Mughlai and Chinese.

I tried it about a month back after coming across few good reviews here. 

The modern interiors give it s proper café look with casual wooden chairs. Apart from ground floor, it has a low first floor carved out of the ground floor height, which gives a view of the flyover at the same level. It is located on the narrow walkway beside the flyover to the station from the Jagat Cinema end, on the same side of the road, in the middle of old shops.

Ordered a grilled fish without looking at the menu as I was in the mood for the dish for some time. The menu is neatly divided between soup, entrée, salad & cold dishes, round the hour, main course and beverages & desserts with plenty of non-vegetarian and vegetarian options. The prices fall between budget and premium. For instance a cup of coffee comes at Rs 45 and cream of chicken soup at Rs 65. As summer is approaching, I like the fact that that they have cold dishes like chicken mayonnaise (Rs 175) and fish mayonnaise (Rs 210) on the menu.

The grilled fish arrived within fifteen minutes, served with sautéed vegetables and potato chips. A thick fillet topped with a milky white cream-based sauce and mustard sauce. The fish was of good quality. Inside the crisp exterior was succulent fish, with mustard sauce in every bite. The sharpness of the sauce enhanced the taste. The veggies in between the bites balanced the taste and helped relish the fish all the more. A good evening snacking experience! The menu price was Rs 220 but I got it at Rs 180 as part of an ongoing offer.

Wish to go back to the café to explore more.

I went twice,experience is very good.
Stuffs are very cordial.
It is very closely situated to sealdah station.
And it is really impressing they are trying to make the cafe going on at that place!
Anyway,coming to the food.
Club sandwich is awesome,I had it both days.
Chicken ala Kiev is very good and baked fish also didn't fail to excite the taste buds !
The only negative was a slight foul smell was coming from fish,though it was very little,so didn't complain!
Would recommend! :)

I pass by this cafe everyday, while returning home from work, and have been planning to visit it for a long time, since this place looks oddly sophisticated amidst the chaotic surroundings of Sealdah. Had the opportunity to visit the cafe today, as I was at Sealdah for some work. Firstly, the location is very odd, as it was very difficult to walk through the crowded footpath towards this cafe, in the afternoon. By the time we got to the cafe, we were drained in the heat and crowd. The cafe however was empty, and we (my mother and me), decided to sit on the first floor. The menu was a bit over-priced, considering the location of the cafe, and the fact that it is a new and small restaurant. We ordered 1 grilled chicken sandwich , 1 grilled fish, and 2 cold coffee, and the it cost us around Rs. 500. We were the only customers there, at that time, and received good hospitality from the waiter. However, the food was not extraordinary at all, and the quantity was not too great, either. Moreover, we found traces of fish-bone, in our grilled fish :(  Somehow, felt the cafe owners have taken a bold step by opening a continental restaurant in an area such as Sealdah. However, there is much room for improvement.

A first of it's kind in Sealdah. Continental is the specialty of this place...cold coffee, chicken ala kiev,and fish preparations as well as grilled items is a must try out . Budget friendly. Perfect place to hang around with friends. Chinese, Indian, as well as tandoor is available.
