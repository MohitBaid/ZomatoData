A very small place near girish park metro station . Cozy place and ambience lacks decor .the upper part is like some sort of attic.  Food was good we order an Italian combo, and margarita pizza.

Visited the place for the first time during the puja. 
Though i am a non vegetarian but its its about food...all i need is tasty food to feed myself.
I took a parcel so didnt went upstairs thus i should not comment about the ambience. 
Coming to the food. The dishes were tasty and was in a good quantity. I really loved it. And would surely visit it again.

Not so good place. Whenever I get hungry, this place is the last place I would wanna go.¬†The food is very average and often a disaster.¬†The service is not at all good.¬†I have been to this place more than twice (just because my different friends forced me to) but the place could never change my opinion about it.

Never visited the place but heard about it a lot from frnds n all so wanted to give it a try so ordered Mongolian rice and veg Hakka noodles and snadwich both the hakka n rice were disaster according to me Mongolian rice was like having a rice soup too much gravy in it and hakka was average given the price of it only  eatables were cheese corn sandwich which tasted quite good so my only experience was not that good hoping they would improve their quality of Mongolian as it is one of my fav dish

I used to hang out here a lot during college times with my friends. We discovered this place accidentally while finding a place to pee. Hehe. And since then it became one of my fav place to hangout. They make some good food like pizzas, burgers and baby corn. I like their slushes too. The service is a bit late and the place is small but the food makes up for all of them. The burgers they make can give takkar to all the burger giants in the city. Love this place.

It's a pure veg place. Have come here often during my college days. As there were my classmates accompanying me who were not very keen on trying new dishes, we had the Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Pizza. The babycorn was good. The pizzas were just okayish. Containing no non veg ingredients disappointed me a lot. So, this much only.

A small, cosy cafe with pretty red lights overheard. Sitting arrangement is quite innovative. Perfect use of space. 
        Coming to food, the spicy arabatee cheese baked pasta is a must try. Italian pizza and nachos were okayish. The Apple mint soda lime and masala thumbs up were good.
         It can get a bit overcrowded during rush hours. Also all items on the menu aren't available at all times.

This review is based on the two online orders made via Zomato. 

First the pros

The pizzas here come with readymade base, but the toppings are generous and tasty. Though if you try two or three types, most will taste all the same. Price is reasonable.

And the cons

The pasta which I ordered was horrible. I ordered an "Ogilio olio pepper chino pasta in spaghetti with cheese" (as they had no spaghetti in stock, they replaced it with penne, which I approved) and there was no hint of garlic in it. 

But as the pizza was ok, I placed my second order with them few days later. This time I ordered two pizzas, one regular and the other thin crust. The thin crust one 30 bucks costlier. But what they delivered were two pizzas with the same thick base. 

The other item I ordered was Chilli Chinese Potato. When I first opened the container, I thought they have send the same horrible pasta again. Then I realised this was the same sauce and herbs, only with potato fingers replaced by the penne pasta. They serve potato fingers / french fries along with cheese and Italian herbs and call it Chilli Chinese Potato? Add to that the potatoes were stale. 

I would never go back to them for food.

When I visited for the first time, we ordered sandwich, pasta and noodles. Sandwich tasted a little sour, noodles was not that good, pasta was nice..
2nd time : we had baby corn which was nice :)
3rd time : we went with the Little App's coupon for 2.. the soup was ok. Baby corn was very less in quantity from the normal days. Noodles were THANDA.. Manchurian and red tok was ok.
I told the staff not to make the food spicy, but it was.. they put the entire food on the table.. i said them to take the noodles n manchurian, they took it.. but after 15-20mins, they just brought it like that; they dint cook it.. the staff said "garam krke dia tha" but the manager said "mam garam krne se khrb ho jta hai".. the manchurian had an insect in it. Thank God my friend saw it in the dim lights that they had in heir cafe.. The couples who were sitting neside us complained that they had "hair" in their food.. the manager said sorry for this !!
4th time : had veg hakka noodles which was good in taste ! They improved ! Sufficient quantity at just Rs 89 !

This people cheat the hell out,  me and my friends went to hang out there and what they did was they provided every item with half of its original or normal quantity, 
The bowl was half filled,  noodles shit half and the tok was just water 
And when complaint abt it to them they just laughed with no shit guilty on there face..... 

Shit place to visit with high charges and less quantity....

Small cafe but that's the specialty of the girish park area, almost all cafes and food joints here are small. Good enough to have a quick bite, but seems like a teen place. Couples or groups of friends hang out (read adjust somehow) here and have fun time! I had veg maggi here which was okay. Might not visit it again even if I get a chance.

Such a GREEDY owner, I ordered a grilled sandwich (panner tikka) for parcel. While waiting for half an hour for that one piece of sandwich, ask them whether everything is okay or not (cause I can see from outside the grilling machine is poor maintained and its take much longer time than expected). They said everything Okay, but after coming home I find a semi grilled sandwich (all ingredients are raw inside). ¬†It seems that the grilling machine is not in working at all. No way anyone can eat it, ¬†I have to throw the food. Will never get back there.

Located on Vivekananda Road near Girish Park. This joint is very small and you have to climb tiny stairs to reach a low height floor where you will be seated. This place is ideal if you are on a low budget and looking for hanging out with friends, food is satisfactory though the service is very slow. I would recommend sandwiches which are cheap and filling along with some other snacks. This place just got a makeover and looks better than before.

FOOD- One of d bst places in north kolkata for sandwiches. If u r in a bunch of buddys then opt for club sandwich.
AMBIENCE- Perfect, u'hv got 3 options, outdoor seating, indoor seating & there is olso a first floor which is the bst option(A.C) bt its quiet small.
SERVICE- Serving time ws 5-10 mins, staff is well trained, young & courteous.

The place is small, nevertheless the food is delicious. The cafe has unique seating arrangement on sponge-seats where you have to sit cross-legged. You can spend hours there gossiping with friends or spending quality time with ur beloved, having no one nearby to disturb. ;) We had American Cheese Corn Sandwich and Exotic Italian Cottage Cheese Sandwich which left us licking fingers. Also had Mango Shake, which was equally good. However they took some time to deliver the food, for which we were going restless. Never mind, it's a nice little place for veg food and most importantly, pocket-friendly too :)

its near to my place, was coming back walking from girish park in the evening and noticed it, was hungry and entered the place for light evening snacks with one of my friends. its a small place with a few chairs scattered here and there in the shop and in the pavement also. mostly students like us go there to have food and a small chit-chat. we both ordered grilled sandwiches, the place is a veggie one. the food is good compared to the prices. definitely not a place to dine in as one can see from the menu posted here in zomato.

Awesome pasta!! American clubbed sandwich is my favorite.. Drinks too are very nice! Only issue is lesser space, sometimes have to wait!

I have eaten in Urbans Cafe around 20 times during my 2.5 months stay in Kolkata and I find the taste yummy. Their Harvest Pasta is THE BEST pasta that I have ever eaten. I have tried other items like pizzas, burgers, etc. and they were also deliciously good, especially Paneer Pizza. 
The price is very economic but menu is limited. 
The only drawback is the lack of sitting space.
Just try & have fun as I had.

This is a perfect place for college students and young couples..I went there several times.It is really really fun to sit on the cushions with friends and go on gossiping for hours.Their delay in service,small place,and no stuff at the first floor...all fit for the college students in a lazy evening.The food is average(it does not matter),pocket friendly.Not a recomended place for dine in(that also can be said from the menu).
