Went there with my friends last week.. We ordered Chicken Momo & Chicken Thukpa. The Momo was over boiled and the Thukpa was horrible. It was like boiled water with 2/3 tiny pieces of chickens in it. Moreover, you have to add salt & black pepper on your own. The quantity was also too less. Really very disappointed.

Hello people. We ordered the following from Nik's The Momolicious:
1. Cappuccino- It was satisfactory. It just costs Rs 35 and what they offer at that price is fair enough.
2. Chicken Thukpa- Regarding this dish, to be precise not worth a penny. Nothing great about it. Little amount of chicken with very dull taste. You can choose this dish only when you are running low on your finance and when you are extremely hungry.
3. Chicken Sandwich- Firstly, the sandwich was grilled which I presume everyone loves. The sandwich tasted nice. It was served with chips and ketchup.
4. Maggi- there's nothing new about Maggi. I wish it was less soupy.
This place is inexpensive and serves good food so I would definitely recommend this place to the students who are looking for some comfort from the tormenting heat in the AC. The seating area is neither very spacious nor comfortable.

This was just a passers-by stop for me. Some random momo cravings and there it was.
Will keep it really short and sweet. 
Ordered Thukpa and Pan Fried Chicken Momo in sweet and sour sauce, rest being unavailable.
Neither grand, nor bland.
Thukpa was compatible with taste buds.
However they might have misplaced the concept of pan frying. It was simply steamed momos in a mainstream over-spicy sauce. 'That was a let down. 
So there's that.
You can just stop by this one as a cheap date, cause the ambience ain't half bad.

Served sandwiches, momos and coffee in affordable price. Ambience was nice and hospitality was very good. Served in quick time and presentation was really nice. Staff was friendly. Proper sitting arrangement but self service option. I ordered sandwich with latte which was very good in taste. Sandwich was perfectly grilled and tastes Good. Latte was also tastes good. A visit and try place. Recommended.

This place sells cheap food for the times when you are broke. They offer a variety of sandwiches, momos, pakodas amd thupka. We took momos and Thupka, they had a decent taste and the quantity was enough for the price.

After getting tired roaming around in chandni chowk area, I wanted something light yet filling. I reckoned my brother mentioning this place. I asked for directions and this place was fairly easy to locate. It's located near regal cinema, right beside CCD.

The staff is polite. It's a small eatery which is very light on pocket. We ordered a chicken momo in hot garlic sauce , veg momo in sweet chilli sauce, paneer cheese sandwich and coke. It amounted to 230 bucks only !
Food is pretty good :)

Happy eating!

Momo joints are now covering almost each and every corner of kolkata. Niks's another one of those momo joints made its entry with their only outlet in Chadni Chowk. 
So this place is a bit tricky to find, we found it while travelling from Chadni Chowk to Esplanade on the left side..
This place doesnt put a lot of effort in the docoration, even the sign board is also covered with dust. 
The place was small and long rectangular in shape, 3tables with 4chairs were laid out on one side of the place and a small table with two chairs on the other side and the kitchen at the end was half covered with a glass. Beside that there was a water filter serving chilled and pure water is really a great addition.
This place is a self serving joint so you have to place your order in the reception and then have to carry that slip to the kitchen and after a couple of minutes I was asked to carry my plate to my table.
In Zomato it says the place is air conditioned, but i failed to find any except 2small table fans on two extreme corners.
The coffee machine with a big sticker of CCD is a bit funny though.. 

A small joint specialized in momo,so our order started with 

A plate of Chicken Steamed Momo - - 7 pieces of momo with a bowl of soup and sauce for 60inr..Chicken was stuffed in plenty in each of them which was then wrapped with soft coats. Soup was nothing fancy, a boul of hot water with pepper and salt. Spring Onions cut in small pieces covered the entire plate and also the bowl of soup.. 
--Rating - 4/5--

Next we ordered a plate of Chicken Lollipop - - 4piecesof chiceken laid on each corner of a square plate with Tomayo Sauce in the middle. The coating was a bit chewy and thick and tasted 'Stale' to us. The sauce and the soup(Momo) helped a lot to gulp down those chewy pieces. 
--Rating - 2/5--

Price for a couple is generally between 150-200..

So to conclude, it was a mixed experience but i would love to give this place some more visits in the near future. The name of the place clearly gives a idea why this place is named Momolicious specially after i tried chicken lollipop.. 

--PROS--
Quality of Momo
Chilled water filter

--CONS--
A pair of fans on extreme corner really is a bad sign during summer.

Nik's....really is momolicious!! Being really exhausted after a long and tiresome happy shopping time,me and my companion samik guha decided to drop in here and grab a quick bite. The joint is really small and doesn't have a proper name board also...so it becomes really a problem for the passers by to notice. We had almost left from the area when suddenly we noticed this tiny place. Small yet tidy,this place attracted me the second i saw 'momos' written on the menu card here. Being a really big fan of the tibetan dish,we opted for a plate of steamed momo and 1 plate of chicken lollipop. This place has got only 2 small fans attached at 2 extreme corner tables,other than that there is no other means for making people comfortable during summer days. Though in other areas the place has done extremely well...they have got a water filter from where you will get chilled water to quench your thirst and to really cool you down from inside. The fibre glasses placed above the filter were totally clean and i even liked the design of the glasses:-P
The place is a self service joint and so we had to bring our food ourselves to the table. When the food arrived it really made my mouth water. 7 pieces of momo(in earlier reviews i had read that they served 8 pieces,may be recently they had changed their menu card) garnished well and the spring onions on top was really something to savour. The amount of meat that they have provided inside for just 50 bucks was really incredible. The soup was also well made with the perfect amount of salt and spring onions spread to make the dish more tasty. It took me no time to finish off the momos....the whole preparation really made me delightful. Now coming to the chicken lollipops,this one really took away the mood. From the first bite only we concluded that the meat was stale,the outside portion was chewy with oil seeping badly,the taste was okayish though was stale. 4 pieces were provided by them and we didn't enjoy a single piece. Anyway,from the name i can make out that nik's specialises in momos and now i know why they named it momolicious. This place doesn't pinch your pocket at all but their awesome taste will definitely pinch you taste buds! I would highly recommend people to drop in here once to taste this awesome tibetan item. Overall,nik's made me really happy and am definitely going back to try some more of their items..!

nice place to hangout with friends specially when you are dead tired after so much shopping in new market and craving for sum delicious chinese food i will recommend this joint . its one of those places which is not pretencious, by pretencious i mean those chinese drawings or lamps which has nothing to do with the food this place has nothing like that ..just a small place with limited seats no place to move if three people are moving around at the same time. but something that wont disappoint you is the lip smacking pan fried momos and pan fried noodles with different variety of sauces ..and the icing on the cake the prices are quite reasonable ..and when i say reasonable i mean well "reasonable" ... so if your exhausted and broke after shopping in new market and still hungry this is the place to go .....so gooo ...dumb bells :P
p.s - i  dont care about the spelling mistakes coz the food is darn good :p

In case you are moving around at Esplanade, Metro Cinema Hall, S N Banerjee area for some work & want some tasty, quick & HEALTHY food, you can try this outlet. It is a "value for money" small eatery serving momos, thumpa, soups , sandwiches etc., coffee. They serve 8 small chicken steamed momos along with soup @ Rs 60/- only. The taste is good enough & is definitely a better option in case you are tired of rolls in this area. The location is little difficult, being next to the glamorous CCD off SN Banerjee Road, on the lane opposite to Regal Cinema to be precise.

This little momo place is located near New Market area.
I often try new places and one fine day entered here, the aunty who is the owner is the nicest woman i've ever known.First impression was quite good, clean place, air conditioned, impressive ambience and now food.The thing is i have been to so many places but i have never ate in a place with the food price so cheap and food being really good.Momos are really fresh, in fact every food is really fresh and here is the best part, you can make your custom tasting momo.How much spicy, with or without pepper, onions should be there or not.Season of navratri or any other this place will be there impress you.
Self-Service though.
