I'm really amazed that this place has a rating of 3.2.  It clearly qualifies to above 4.2 at least. 
Some of the best milk based sondesh, some with nice cocoa twist, amazing malai rolls, melt in mouth rosogolla.. Even their bonde is fabulous! And what value for money! 

The winner, though, is their doi..  Not over sweet like many others.. Just the right amount of sweetness (diabetic members in the family can take a spoon or two), fresh and creamy! Amazing!

A very competitively priced shop in the area, which now faces competition from the newly opened Ghosh & Co. Been eating its sweets for more than a decade and they ensure good quality and quantity consistently. Nolen gurer sweets are a must have. Their mishti doi and paneer is good too. Avoid their son papdi though.

Sweets in Kolkata are as old as its culture. For the past many generations, the shop has made the sweet-toothed Kolkatan very happy.  Being situated very close to my place it was probably the first sweet shop i came across when I used to go to School at KG 1.  I was student of KIDYZONE, Kashi Bose Lane at that level.  With time they have changed a lot. Renovated the looks. Only One thing has not changed that is the variation and freshness of the sweets.  They are having a huge adjacent space  for the making of those delicious sweets.

Whenever I see a sweets store I stop by to taste their sweets. Nani Lal Ghosh is one of them which I saw during a photo walk in the streets of Shovabazar. I tasted few of their sweets. Lancha was very good. Also tried their Rosogolla, equally good. 
Location is bit odd. Prices are less

The rating is for the mishti 'Doi'. I will say they serve the best mishti 'Doi' in Kolkata that I have tasted. The doi is not too sweet but has the perfect amount of sweetness, its smooth and churned out well.

Was passing by with my friend on foot, when I was almost forced to try their Mishti Dahi. Being a sweetbuff, couldn't refuse either. Smooth and silky, if not the best, the Mishti Dahi was really good. Probably churned out from a better quality milk, it can easily compete with the likes of Amrit!

A good sweetshop for the people in north calcutta who have a sweet for every occasion. Do drop in. Its value for money and also the owners are happy to help you if are clueless as to what to order.
