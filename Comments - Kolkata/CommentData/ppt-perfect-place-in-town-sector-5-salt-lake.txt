A completely awesome and amazing place. Perfect lake view ambience best suited for both evening time from the open roof terrace and the inner seating. Both the internal ambience and external scenic beauty were fabulous
The food was very delicious and delightful. Both starters and main course were delectable.
The mocktails were especially amazing. The presentation of the mocktails were extraordinarily superb and even the taste was fantastic. We a group of 6 had 9 mocktails overall.
The service was good. 
The Dj and dance floor too were nice.
Overall it is indeed a perfect place in town

WORST SERVICE EVER RECEIVED. Tye place is new looks great food is also good hookah is also nice but THE SERVICE IS WORST. You get hookah after 45 mins to an hour u need to yell to call staff members. Two portions of a same dish gets served with a time difference of 40 mins main course is not even served after ordering and waiting for 1 hour that all when the place had less than 10% occupancy. 
SERVICE RUINED ALL THE AMBIENCE TASTE AND MOOD

A new place in town off course. Located at the rooftop of Stesalit Tower, view is awesome you can see the lakes from the terrace and is perfect for an winter afternoon. Now coming to food, it is good except for the sizzler which is not so tasty but their Murg malai tikka is mouth watering yum. Hookah are good but liquor is only available on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Otherwise it‚Äôs really nice and must say at the end you get complimentary ice cream. But yes till now payment through card swipe is not available but soon it will be. Overall experience was good.
