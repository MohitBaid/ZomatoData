A sweet shop very close to Baguihati VIP Road. They deliver quite nice sweets and desserts. They have another facility of selling Kulfi in this outlet, which is extremely delicious. But, I personally I do not like few of their items, like Kala Jamun, Chomchom etc. But the rests like chocolate items are cool.

Its located at the junction of Baguiati near 44 bus stand. Visited here soo many times. Famous in doi, rosogolla, aamsotto Misti etc. They have a faluda counter outside the outlet which is super tasty.

Not a branded one, but yes u get some quality sweets at this baguiati more shop. What i liked most their kulpi at the summer time. They served it in a very plain steel bowl like a road side jhups but u can relish it while having during the summer time after jostling in overcrowded baguaiti. It costs 25 rs plate.
