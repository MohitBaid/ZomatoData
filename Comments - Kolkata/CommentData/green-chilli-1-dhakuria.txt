Average rated is the term that I use for this restaurant. It's not really a restaurant though. There's this very small food joint in a lane. They offer good food at more or less pocket friendly prices. 
Their chicken tandoori is something I really loved. It was flavourful and rich in taste.
Their rolls are pretty average in taste,nothing exceptional as such. 
Their noodles are pretty well flavoured. 

Not recommended.

A review that has been long overdue. This small eatery and take away is very close to my place. Chicken Roll is good, Mutton roll is equally atrocious. Momos are good considering the price that they charge. Had Tadka from here, one of the most oiliest I've ever had. The Chinese items like Chili Chicken and Chowmein are pretty average. The fish fries are quite good.On the whole it's an okayish place to get food from....but what else can you expect. That certain items are reasonably good is a steal in itself. It would be wrong to expect something big from a low budget place like this. 
Bottom line: Certain stuff like Chicken Roll and Fish Fries can be ordered but that's about it.

The food is cheap. I would suggest to keep no expectation at all. Especially at night when its a rush hour for the outlet. The afternoon food is marginally better . Average maybe a word to describe the place .

Not a very good place to start with. The chinese is not up to the mark and the dining conditions are not that comfortable. The service is also not good and on crunch hours takes a lot of time to deliver the food. The quality and quantity both are questionable. On the brighter side, it's cheap. Other than that not a very good place to hang out and dine. Not recommended and definitely not one of those places where I would go to have chinese.
