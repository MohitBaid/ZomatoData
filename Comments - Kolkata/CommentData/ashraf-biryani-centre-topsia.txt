It's not a high end shop or something a small establishment in a area who offers delicious biryani. Not happy with home cooked dinner my brother prefers half portion or rather plate of chicken biryani for dinner. My all time favorite is Beef Biryani. One thing I will mention is on Friday they sell only chicken biryani at the cost of beef biryani and they also make khichri it's not the usual khichri we have at home but it's good. A humble shop.

After 1 hr 30 min the shopkeeper informs that they can't deliver the food as it was raining. It was late night and there is no such option for another resturant. First they promised for a 25 min delivery then after 40 min when i called up they ask for 15 min more. I was agree with that but finally they denied my food dellivery. 

Taste of the food never matters if the service is such unprofessional & inconvinient. Zomato should have removed such nonsence vendors who are spoiling Zomato's reputation. 

Thank you.

The rates have increased marginally now.  The taste of biryani is fantastic.
