Try their any kind of fried chicken...you will surely love it ...
If you are true lover of Kolkata style Biriyani don't go for their biriyani combo...it tastes good but it has quite South Indian flavours... they serves tasty burgers at low price...try their hot lava cake... this is also tasty...

But I don't like their chicken fries that's why I'm giving them 4.5* ...

After having pathetic chicken popcorn from KFC during Navami this year , tried to find some better food joint that provides fresh and tasty chicken popcorn at pocket-friendly prices. And finally my wait for the same came to an end yesterday after one of my chums referred me about M&E joint located near my residence. Now Coming to the chicken popcorn, I would like to mention that it's complete an innovative way of preparing chicken popcorn (by M&E)with no extra spices but yet yummy and light on one's digestive system. Moreover it's soft and juicy which easily melts in mouth. Really a good experience with M&E after having a horrible experience with chicken popcorn at KFC.Kudos and keep it up M&E. üëçüëçüëå

The DB grilled chicken burger is so tasty, so meaty, so juicy. The firy fried chicken is also very good. Chicken fries are ok. The service is really great and the ambience is ok.

A newly opened joint near central jail more ...its a copy of kfc just at a lower price...ordered chicken cheese burst burger , which i found to be quite impressive as per its price (dont compare it with kfc..they are providing u at half a price than kfc..so its worthless to compare)..will definitely try the other options from the menu..

Nice and small outlet near Central Jail bus stop.The seating arrangement was 2 tables each with 4 chairs.The menu offered different types of burgers, wraps, crispy fried chicken, Mojitos etc which reminded me of KFC.I ordered the gourmet steak chicken burger.The chicken patty tasted delicious with good quality mayo. The burger bun was good too (KFC much better, if you compare). I didn't like the yellowish lettuce(??) they added in the burger. Overall it cost me Rs.95 +GST. I think it is good as it is cheaper than KFC.

Just noticed two days back this place and found it pretty filled out so today at Ashtami evening decided to pay it a visit. Nice bright, small and quaint place with young friendly staff. Tried their Chicken Burger which was just like KFC quality Chicken Zinger Burger with a crispy fried soft tender chicken, good quality mayo and lettuce. Quality at par with KFC but at almost 15% to 20% cheaper. Beside the drinks and desserts looked yum which I will certainly try out. Great place just walking distance from my residence.
