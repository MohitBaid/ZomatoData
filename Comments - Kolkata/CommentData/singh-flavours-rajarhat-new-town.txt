Ordered chelo kebab, mixed fried rice and chicken gravy. The mixed fried rice was awesome, absolutely loved it. The chelo kebab was very average though. The rice tasted very blunt and could have used a bit of tempering. The chicken gravy tasted pretty good though. We Initially ordered a mutton gravy but after ordering was informed abt the unavailability and was offered chicken gravy...The guy who called was very casual and almost threatened to cancel the order if we refused the chicken dish. We were famished and it was already late when they informed so we went ahead with whatever. A little better customer service can ensure a long run.

Ordered online ------------ Chicken Manchurian

The PROS:- Really loved their Chicken Manchurian. The Chicken pieces (total 8) were well cooked & were good in size. The gravy was sweet but very spicy (TIKHA HATERS Beware!!!) with good amount of garlic. Quite Fresh.Reasonable Price. Super Fast delivery. Good Packaging.

The CONS :- Nothing.

Love this restaurant. Its practically my lifeline. whenever i am alone at home or with friends i love to order from this place. the food is delicious and price is cheap. i order from swiggy mostly.
The most important thing to order here is:
1. chicken egg roll
2. tikka rolls
3. paneer tikka
4. chicken tikka
5. chicken butter masala
6. mixed chow gravy- MOST RECOMMENDED
7. fried rice all varieties
8. indian dishes- dal fry/makhani, chicken dopiaza/handi/ mutton items

they donot keep mutton items unless previous ordered.

the things that are frequently found u should order mostly. one or two items are not good, like Lemon Chicken cause they do not know how to make it. they though lemon was mausambi. anyway, and the pepper chicken kebab. it was too salty and i personally nick-named it Nona Kebab

but otherwise, it serves delicious chinese, and rolls. I am in love with mixed chow gravy (even better than grubclub or chowman)and right now I ordered the crispy chicken. Lets see how it is. hope u people liked this review

PS: Singh flavours please make chicken/mutton dum biriyani another item in your menu!!!
