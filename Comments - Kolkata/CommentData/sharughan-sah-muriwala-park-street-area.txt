Sharughan Sah Muriwala seats infront of Bombay Dying in Russel Street. Their Jhal Muri was really good. He charges according to the portion you want. A normal portion comes for Rs.20, if you want smaller he has option too, for Rs.10.
The Muri he prepared was really tasty. Liked it very much.

This masala muri stall was situated in Russell street of park Street area in front of Bombay Dieying showroom. Served masala muri, bhel muri, masala toast and batata. No sitting arrangement. Price was a bit high. Owner was friendly but sometimes behave rude. I tried their masala muri which was full of flavour and tastes really good. A must try place. Recommended.
