সায়েন্স কলেজ এর একদম বিপরীতে , সাধারণত কলেজ পড়ুয়াদের ভির বেশি থাকে । একদম রাস্তার ধারে একবার ঢুঁ মেরে গেলে মন্দ হয় না । মাসালা ধোসা বেশি পছন্দের ।

A roadside eatery joint, this one is quite popular among the students, for their pocket-friendly pricing. Located close to the Law College, Sandwiches are apparently more popular here. Besides, they cater to the South Indian cuisine as well. I had tried the Dosa once, which was quite good comparing to the roadside standards. Again, nothing extraordinary about this place, but can serve as a decent option for a quick bite.

Vaiyas is a small ppcker friendly south Indian food outlet.

##Location:
It is located on Hazra road just opposite to the Law college.

##Experience: I got some dosa, idly and bada from here one fine evening back at home which after having around 1-1.5 hours back was tasty. I had used microwave to warm up the food though. The sambar was excellent in taste and thick as well. I liked their food specially the quality and taste. Good one indeed.

Absolute opposite to Ballygunge Science college, well during my university days this pocket friendly joint was our 2nd option after canteen. So we were kind of regular customers here at that point.
Suggestive picks be :
Aloo paratha
Masala dosa
Sandwich
I don't like polao much though.
A tiny joint mainly take away or else with limited seats also can get stuck up at busy hours! But a cheap place for staple food.
Thus,
RECOMMENDED!

Vaiya's is mainly famous for their pocket friendly south indian cuisines..Though I tried all recipes but I love their 'Onion Dosa','Club Sandwich','Dahi Vada','Mixed Uttapam','Aloo paratha' and 'South Indian Pulao'..The quantity and the quality of food is undoubtedly good..Though it is a road side food joint but they maintain their standards of hygiene (that is why I like this place)..I think this joint is one of our (students of University Of Calcutta,Department Of Law,Hazra Campus) favourite..And a  BIG thumbs up for this SMALL joint..

This place is a small road side fast food outlet type setup with around 8 seats placed on the pavement area, opposite to Hazra Law college. Given this location, it primarily serves to the college or local crowd there (also if you are low in budget as there is another much popular South Indians restaurant very close to it).
Coming to the food it serves idli, vada, dosa varieties, sandwich, pav bhaji, etc. - staple food for folks wishing to have a quick bite. Dosa was not the authentic type but more of the customized Kolkata variety you get at roadsides, it was crispy but okay on taste. Vada was over fried, it felt like yesterday's leftover which was fried again. Chutney and sambar was watery.
All in all a place recommended for a quick snack if you're hungry and happen to pass by.
