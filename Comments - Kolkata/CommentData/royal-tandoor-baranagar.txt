Firstly this is at dakshineswar,not baranagore.basically local food joint where you shouldn't eat unless you're too much hungry and not lucky enough to find other places. Coming to food, my big question"what were those?"

Their food quality is above average and much hygienic than nearby restaurants. They are good with the Chinese dishes and very much pocket friendly too.
Home delivery is available too if you live nearby.
