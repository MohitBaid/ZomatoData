Bandana Chat Centre had set up their stall as part of the Calcutta Classics Food Festival at City Centre. I visited their stall to have some papdi chaat. The pricing was great at 50rs. I loved the chat. Right mix of curd and all the syrups with a lot of sev on top. It was crunchy and wasn't very sweet, much to my liking.

This small corner is worth mentioning for their collection of all kind of Chat. I have tried a few here, their Mix Chat, Delhi Chat and kachori chat are really good.
I also tried their Samosa for Rs.10 it was average in taste.
They also have a good collection of Sweets here.

This is a sweet shop which also serves some decent chats. Basic seating is available within the shop. Though the sweets are nothing extraordinary, if you are here for the chats can try some sweets too.

The aloo tikki chat is my favourite here. It is quite good. So is the singara chola chat.

If you are nearby and love chats can give this place a try.

Nothing special about the place. Overpriced. You will find similar chats and stuff anywhere else at a cheaper price in the city. Or better if it's costlier. Have been there 3-4 times, during my college days, not impressed

This place keep on detoriating and then tries to rectify somehow. It was a pure mess after the split but have managed to gain some popularity in recent times. Their aloo tikki with chola is an all time favourite and sweets are very good. Plz don't do disputes among yourselves.

This is an old shop which I have been seeing for a long time, but visited only recently. It sells sweets, snacks and chats. If you are coming from Girish Park crossing towards Beadon Street or Sovabazar crossing, following Chittaranjan Avenue (Central Avenue), the shop is on the right hand side of the road.
                                                                ...

After much insistence by my mother, I finally decided to give this place a try. A very traditional chats and sweets shop, the place is conveniently situated near Girish Park Metro. Size of the place is not great but still, a couple of seating arrangements have been made. We ordered their popular Tikia Chola chat which was pretty small, chola quality quite ordinary and overall, it turned out to be just an average item. Khasta kachori and cutlets were good but not great either. We also sampled their samosas, which again did not match our expectations. All items were served with gur chutney. 

Hygiene of the place needs immediate redressal. However, we were quite satisfied with the prompt and polite service. Prices are high considering quantity and quality served. Nevertheless, this place enjoys its share of dog customers in the Burra Bazaar area where people look forward to eating out more and more!

One of the oldest chat center of kolkata. Still popular because their is no close substitute on this area. Small outlet but with good sitting arrangement. Hospitality and ambitious was just okay. Service was quick and presentation was very nice. Sweets were tasty and they have many unique sweets too. Come to snacks and chat they were tasty and spicy with marwari tough. Not satisfied with price. Price was little high compare to taste and quantity. Average experience. One time visit place.

Loved the place for its chaat. My relatives live nearby so whenever I visited them chaat was ordered from bandana. This place is my om's favorite. The dahi kachori, Raj kachori and tikkis were heavenly. 

My personal favorite are the Veg Cutlets. In sweets Gulab jamun used to be our pick. It has been a while since I have visited kolkatta, but would visit soon and would definitively go for Â bandana's chaat.

For me it was a gala time if i was going to bcc on Sunday evening with parents - I have spent so many Sunday evenings in this restaurant during my childhood - veg cutlet is all time fav - tikia chola is also good - somehow the restaurant could not maintain its quality I have not visited it from long time but surely will try it once I am at that location

One of the most sweetest place since my childhood days with my father. Most authentic kaju barfis you can have here. The flavors of raw n roasted spices is just an awesome experience. Very delicious mouth watering sweets n snacks you can have here.

Once known for its chaats especially the tikia chola, this place could not quite maintain the same reputation over years !!!

Located at a 5 minute walk from girish park metro station on central avenue, Bandana Chaat Centre offers variety of snacks, chaats, few of which are very good and also sweets items which disappoint. The prices aren't so cheap. There are a few seats available but i would prefer the outlet for a takeaway. Tikia chola chaat is the best chaat on menu. Other than that, dahi vadas, paw bhaji, papri chaats, cutlets are decent. Club kachori on offer in the morning is pretty good. Sweets are not always fresh which is a big negative and anyways i would prefer a nakur chandra and girish ch sweet shop which is pretty close by.

Overall, the place could be a value for money if the right items are ordered and i would suggest them to maintain the quality of food at all times without compromising on their freshness.
