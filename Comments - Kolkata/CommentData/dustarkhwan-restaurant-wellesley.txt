Been there on the auspices day of Eid with my buddy. Great day became more special by their special chicken biryaani. They had only biryaani so can't order  anything else but that was delicious. The ambience is cool.

Thinking of having biryani at a very reasonal price this surely is the place one should head!
Located right in the heart of the city at ripon street is very easy to locate.
Mutton tikia roll , murgh pahadi kebab , murg cheese kebab , mutton stew , chicken chaap and chicken butter masala are some of my favourites here.
The nan and kulcha needs a little inprovement..rest every thing is on point.
Would recommend for a home delivery than dine out experience.

Located near my office , I went there a few months ago.
Tried Mutton biriyani, mutton keema and firni.
Biriyani was above average, less aromatic and light.
Mutton keema was soft, spicy and was delectable.
Firni was average too.
Good quantity food, pocket pinch is cheap , service is quick and staffs are good too.

This place has great food. They always serve fresh piping hot rotis no matter what time you go, which is an edge above the other Mughlai places. They're open almost all night and when you don't have anywhere else to go, dustarkhwan never fails you. Worth a visit.

DUSTARKHWAN is located beside MEZBAN in ripon street and has a nice and fresh look with its interior very bright right inside out. In the english dictionary the Turkic word DUSTARKHWAN means a great spread of food or rather a spread of dining table cloth , and it is a very nice and royal name for  a restaurant . 
The purpose why i landed here was because of a FOOD WALK by PANCH PHORON covering of all the repute places of eating during the holy month of RAMAZAN trying their delicacies . At 3 pm we landed here seeing an almost empty environment as it was 3 to 4 hours left for the roza breaking time ,and everyone was off the streets . Probably we were on the right time as we could eat calmly before without getting to tackle the crowd after the roza breaking time starts . 
From outside there were huge handi's where halim and other special dishes was being prepared one could literally get the aroma off the road too ,it was like an temptation of an invitation to drop inside and try out the foods thats prepared. So without any delay we entered inside and saw the classic interiors in red,yellow and brown very attractive inside . There was ample seating tables and comfortable chairs to rest. The ac was in full swing cooling the place as well as us too ,in the hot climate making it a relaxing atmosphere for sure. Coming to the service and hospitality once the order was placed the food was immediately served  and the waiter and staff people were very
 co-operative at every beck and call .
The food that we tried was at first MUTTON HALIM with TANDOORI ROTI , and then after this we decided to leave for our next venture of location but as we left we met MR : SHAHID SHAMIM who is the director of the restaurant and was very pleased as we gave his restaurant a visit ,so a kind man like him had recommended us to try its restaurant's speciality MUTTON DUM BIRYANI which was cooked on wood fire for some hours overnight as he termed us his guests for the day and insisted we eat so we were on for a taste session .

My experience verdict of the above three food trials were -
 
1) MUTTON HALIM - Was nice and tasty made with rich aroma and having yellow colour identity with special ingredients infused and having a hot and smooth gravy like feeling . A good recommendation to have and quantity wise too its sufficient for two people .

2) TANDOORI ROTI - Was made very soft and crispy at the same time ,big enough and not dry like and went well with the HALIM totally .

3) MUTTON DUM BIRYANI - This was the dish which was a  special dish for the season,as it was cooked on wood fire overnight and was made with fine basmati rice and ingredients toppled with potatoes . The biryani had awesome Mutton pieces inside which was soft and very juicy . After eating this biryani you would not feel heavy and it is good with digestion in a way  as compared to other biryani's . A proper biryani to indulge in as i loved it personally .

Overall  had a nice food venture here and its a good recommendation to eat your Biryani over here totally as well as try the other food dishes the make as it has it own speciality in its own way .

Very nice biriyani with kababs. Mainly chicken tikka kabab was superb . Mix gravey chowmin was also awesome. Nothing to say more. If you are looking good food at cheap rates this is the best restaurant . Only con is size is small .

A perfect day and a perfect Chicken Biryaani from this Rippon street Restaurant. The Biryaani was good but little bit expensive but if u are a biryani lover then u must have to be there.
