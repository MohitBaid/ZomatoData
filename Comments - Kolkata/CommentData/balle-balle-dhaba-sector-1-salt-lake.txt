On the table 
Chicken bharta
Garlic naan
Tandoori chicken
Lassi 
Lime soda (sweet)
The food was great absolutely loved the chicken bharta and tandoori chicken, the naan was crispy and oh so buttery
The lassi was good too,although the sweet lime soda wasn't good at all (wouldn't recommend it)
The ceiling and The walls of the place are filled with quirky bollywood dialogues, movie posters and lots of other things. The ambience is great, it is not at all difficult to find it as because it is right at the main road (neWar city centre 1).
The staff is courteous too.

Ordered food from here and have been to this place earlier also. Food is very tasty. Pure Punjabi taste. The spicy foods are finger liking. 

The only part is food is bit expensive compared to other restaurants of same standards. 

While ordering from Zomato I found the packaging charges are too hefty for which I am annoyed. They charged Rs 55 for packing 2 nonveg dish and one rice dish.

It is located just beside City Center 1
They have outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangements.
The place is well decorated with colorful walls and ceilings with filmy posters..
The music which they play also gives a Punjab feeling..
Service is quite good.
You can try butter tandoori roti.. chicken tikka masala.. chicken bharta..
The kulcha is also very soft.
Overall a great experience.

Located just behind city centre 1, one couldn't ask for a better location. I visited this restaurant quite some time back. 
I loved the fun and quirky decor, though the tables were a bit too crowded close together.
I had chicken lababdar and tandoori roti. The waiter suggested to us the chicken dish, and am glad he did. Spicy, very yummy, and good quantity. A good experience. Planning to visit again sometime.

Ambience nice decored with Punjabi legends frames on the wall of the restaurant. We ordered Paneer Tikka in the starters with soft drinks, then in the main course Dal Makhani & Masala Kulcha & Butter Naan. Masala Papad was a nice thing to try. It will  normally  cost ‚Çπ1000 to ‚Çπ1200 for two.

Food tapping music. Amazing vibe. Colourful decoration and yummilicious food. We ordered for pahari chicken, chicken rara Punjabi and butter naan. Chicken rara was one of a kind. It was was too delicious and would give an instant tickle to ur taste buds. The only let down was their service. I found it a bit rude. Staff were not that much courteous.

Nice interiors represent the punjabi essence, though a bit cosy sitting arrangement. Non-veg dishes with roti are perfect combo to feel "balle balle". Biriyani is awsome and perfect is taste. But the kulfi fails miserably, try firni instead of.

Went to this restaurant for team lunch. On arriving we were informed that cards are not accepted. Anyway, we had got cash with us. So it was fine. 
We ordered boti kabab and tandoori chicken for starters, mutton and chicken biryani with chicken tikka masala and a mutton side dish for mains and gajar ka halwa for dessert. All the preparations were really tasty. The biriyani wasn't dry.. and it tasted awesome with the sides.. and we never imagined they would provide such a huge quantity for dessert. However, the quantity of the biriyani wasn't much, it wasn't even enough for one in certain cases. The alu was soft, so was the mutton piece. According to me, this is a grossly overpriced restaurant not accepting cards. The management should really think twice.

balle balle dhaba can also be named as the heart of saltlake 
The rush was too high during the Christmas time
The food was delicious and the chicken were well tendered
But it has a con to they increase the price during the festive season i have experienced it while in pujas too
The service is a bit slow
The food was amazing 
And it was a bit heavy on pocket if you are visiting in festive seasons otherwise its pocket friendly
The biryani was well cooked  and the chicken bharta was filled with malai it was amazing in short a dhabba worth of trying

We ordered¬†
Egg Tadka : It was very good , as it is a Punjabi ¬†restaurant so we opted for it .
Kadai Chicken : Very well tested but a bit spicy .
Roti and polau both was good .¬†
Then coming to the desert , we ordered firni and gajar ka halwa . Both was too good .

So if you want to have an authentic Punjabi food , then this place is a good choice .

The place is located a few steps away from city centre 1. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangements. The place is small but decorated neatly, bright colourful walls & ceilings, full of filmy posters!!

Coming to food...we ordered tandoori paneer tikka to start with...which tasted amazing!!üòãBut , they didn't serve mint sauce with it!

Next for main course, we had dal-makhani, navratna korma, paneer butter masala , garlic naan, masala kulcha, laccha paratha!

Service was pretty quick!!
The garlic naan was the best garlic naan , i had ever tasted!! Highly recommended!!üëç

For a long time I was eyeing this place and finally I got to visit Balle Balle Dhaba just before Christmas. Starting with the decor, the place is small but very neatly arranged. The decor is very colourful and bright, walls covered with a collage of everything Punjabi- starting from punjab-themed movie posters to santa-banta jokes. They have an open kitchen where you could see the chefs preparing yoyr dishes. The sight is enough to make your stomach gurgle with hunger!
Coming over to the food, we ordered chicken lassuni kebab as starters followed by lachha paratha, masala kulcha and chicken bharta. The kulcha was great and the filling was evenly distributed (even in the corners!). The paratha was great and tasted good with the bharta cooked in kaju (cashew nut) paste. Both the kulcha and the paratha came piping hot, smeared in oodles of butter.
The staff needs special mention here. I never expected such quick service! May be the dhaba wasn't crowded that time but whatever it may be, they were very couteous. Pocket pinch is moderate. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. I would love to visit this place again, and again...and again.

If are looking for some 'desi Indian khana', this is the place to be which will satisfy you without putting a hole in your pocket.
 A special mention would be the keema naan which I find absolutely amazing.
 Their kebabs and other preparations are also amazing and also a big thumbs up to the Punjabi music they play.

It is located just beside city center. I love the food. If you  wish to have  non veg buffet at a reasonable rate around city center then this place is worthwhile. The ambience is good, crowd is okayish. They play only punjabi music. Service was overwhelming. The place is little cozy, but if you are really hungry instead of spending your time then you can visit this place. I feel the best place to have non veg buffet near city center, as i didn't find any non veg restaurant near city center which serves this quality food.

We visited the place for lunch on a sunday afternoon. As expected, being located close to City Centre 1, the place was crowded but we managed to get ourselves a table for 4. We ordered the very old and safe starter item, Tandoori Chicken which turned out to be absolutely delicious. The chicken was extremely tender and flavorful. Following this we ordered the 'Today's Special' item on the menu : Makki di roti & Sarso saag. Yet again a surprising delight. We also ordered Matar Paneer and Tandoori rotis. Being a non vegeterian, I must say that I was beyond satisfied and happy to eat all of it. Every item on the plate was a delight on my palate. To end the meal on a sweet note, we ordered kulfi and were obviously not disappointed :-) Although the seating area seems cramped up and could have been more spacious, but the food makes up for all of it. So do give this tiny colourful dhaba a visit whenever you are in the vicinity! Cheers to Balle Balle!

SERVICE: It's quite good.
MENU: Covers mainly dhaba food but also has a cute blackboard listing today's specials.
FOOD: The makki di roti was crunchy. The Sarson Da saag was perfect with a very creamy texture. The chicken tandoori was the best with soft succulent pieces of juicy chicken. Unfortunately no desserts were available.

Another very popularly known dhaba.
The decor is vibrant fun and quirky. There are these innumerable posters and frames hanging and quoting Punjabi sayings. The kitchen is open to the eaters. There are long tables. But still you can't get seats here easily as this is a common place for office goers.
Food is delicious and totally worth the money. The quantity and quality both are good.
It's situated just steps away from city centre 1.
Visit this for Punjabi fooding experience. Happy fooding üòä

It‚Äôs Nothing Like a Dhaba. Nothing On the menu if ordered is not available. Limited Starters, no Shorba or Soup. They don‚Äôt give onion and pickle like that you need to pay 50‚Çπ for onion and pickle. Food items too limited choice. We ordered dessert and only one cold dessert was available, in winters menu specifies gaajar Halwa, gulab jamun, But not available. Out of 6 dessert items only one item firni was there which very few people will prefer in winters. Plates, glasses, spoon not clean very dusty. We have on a Sunday Night Dinner and this is what we get. Overall experience was just pathetic. From Name it was like we would like to get a Dhaba experience. But from nowhere it was a dhaba experience. Sorry not on my #VisitAgain List. DISAPPOINTING !!!

A small little joint just outside city centre. Beautifully decorated with Punjabi movie posters with cute little Punjabi slogans. And the best thing being the music which is authentically Punjabi. It actually feels like being in Punjab itself. We were escorted to the table right away. We ordered Masala Kulcha, Butter Tandoori roti, chicken tikka masala, chicken Bharta and Firni for dessert. All the dish was really tasty. The special mention being chicken tikka masala. The roti and kulcha were really soft. The chicken were also perfectly cooked. The service was really decent, we did not had too wait too long for the food. Overall a really good experience.

It is an out and out bollywood style dhaba with movie posters doing the walls and the ceiling, iron garden chair and tables covered with posters again.

All the Indian dhaba style dishes are in the menu.

We tried chicken tandoori, which was soft l, succulent and burnt to the correct degree
Reshmi kebab, which was very nicely done.
The fresh lime and lassi were superb too.
Garlic naan and butter naan which were good although there can be lesser garlic in the garlic naan, here there was an overdose.
Chicken lababdar was good but the saag chicken could have been better.

Pocket pinch is pretty cool and it is open till the late hours at night.

Staff is prompt and courteous.

Service is quick too!!

(1) Location: just beside bata and city centre exit gate.

(2) Why we ended up: it was a pre planned dinner and balle balle dhaba has been in my wishlist since a year.¬†

(3) Food ordered: chicken lasooni kebab (h), chicken biriyani, butter naan, mutton rara punjabi.
The kebab was finger licking good, all the items were tasted heavenly. Though the chicken biriyani was little bit cold, but all went perfectly while having naan and mutton rara.

(4) Inside decor & service: the staff members were very affable and attentive. The decor was really very impressive and eye catching. The interiors were filled with posters of singers and actors and yes, they have transparent kitchen. They also played very good punjabi songs which we have enjoyed.

(5) Conclusion: overall experience was quite gratifying and will definitely visit again to have an authentic punjabi food.

Close to office and hungry so thought to tried wih a class mate of college time who suggested to go here.. Balle Balle quite punjabi name and with punjabi ambience, crowded place and happy people on the table after having the food. 
Tried special Dal Tadka which was dry and does not had a special wala taste, breads came well from the tandoori. More option can be added with enhanced punjabi flavour, less with garlic and other punjabi secret ingredients and mehak.

We ordered butter chicken and butter naan and tandoori aloo with green chatni.The tandoori aloo at first did not taste so good but after scrambling it and mixing it with the chatni it tasted just awesome.The butter naan felt like as if butter was melting onto my mouth and butter chicken was on the top of all.Butter chicken was very tasty and very very delicious.Overall it was a very good experience and icing on the cake on a rainy afternoon.

One of the coolest Dhabas in Salt Lake! They have some really cool decor with posters of Sunny Deol and amazing lighting! üòπüôà
Dhaba food has always been like a stress buster for us! I‚Äôve been here a couple of times with my photographer friend Jyotika and colleagues as well. 
Well Punjabi food is generally quite oily but here quality wise the food is quite less spicy and light which is kinda good.
We‚Äôve tried Hariwali chicken kababs, Reshmi Kababs, and Tikka Kababs! 
Coming to main course, butter nun with paneer butter masala is a must have! To bring some change in taste, you can try fried rice with chicken tikka masala. ü§ó
P.S - Don‚Äôt forget the Lassi to complete the meal. üíñ

Hey this an amazing experience in balle balle dhaba, City center one, Mr. Gurbinder the owner of the restaurant being very helpful throughout we were running out of the cash and the card machine of theirs was not working still he saw struggling with that as any Atm was hardly there. He simply said "aap Khao will manage" so kind of him and sympathetic. Overwhelmed with this and looking forward to visit frequently.. people like him are genuine and gemüòÄ

VERY POOR ATTITUDE of the service staff and SAD TASTE OF FOOD
We visited this hotel in the evening and was charmed by the look of the restaurant. Looked like will have a great time.
Ordered a fresh lime with soda to start with and they got some 'Sad' tasting fresh lime soda. seemed like some rotten lime was used to make it and that was the only thing added to the soda. Nothing else to make the drink taste good. We complained but the guy who served named 'Goudh' seemed disinterested to even listen.
Next we ordered 2 Tandori rotis and Daal with Paneer starter.
Trust me the paneer tasted bad and the Daal was like it was cooked in the morning and being served all day by just heating it.
We wanted to return it but did not push for it since it seemed that guy was not even interested to listen OR Even come to our table to ask what else do we need or whether the food was Ok.

After having the rotis and starter, I was about to ask for a bill as nothing seemed good other than the look of the hotel, that guy 'Goudh' got two more rotis and kept on our table. We had not ordered it and told him to take it back. HE RUDELY REPLIED and MADE A FACE LIKE HE WAS IN A FIT OF RAGE AND STARTED A QUARREL. ON ASKING FOR THE MANAGER HE SAID THERE IS NO MANAGER in a RUDE TONE. HE LITERALLY INSULTED AND QUARRELED WITH US TO TAKE THE two rotis even when we had not ordered it. AFTER 10 minutes of persistence, he made a grunting face and EVENTUALLY took it back as other customers were watching all this.

HE EVEN WASN'T WILLING TO GET A BILL QUICKLY AND MADE US WAIT FOREVER TO GET A BILL. AFTER TAKING CASH HE PURPOSELY VANISHED AND DID NOT GET THE CHANGE FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.¬†

NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL AS THERE IS NOBODY TO KEEP A CHECK ON THE STAFF OR FOOD QUALITY NOR THERE IS ANY COURTESY OR MANNERS IN THE STAFF!

Found out this place while strolling around City Center 1 two weeks back. 
We never thought two hungry souls would find absolute solace in the amazing taste of chicken bharta. 
As the name suggests this place really looks looks like a dhaba but in a totally different manner. The constant playing of cool punjabi songs are gonna make your stay better and would want to make you tap your feet. Plus who wouldn't like to see their food being prepared right in front of their eyes ? 
Sumptuous quantity is totally an add on. 
Courtesious sraff, great food and ambience while surely want to make you revisit as often as you can.

Situated right beside City Centre, Salt Lake, Balle Balle Dhaba gives the authentic Punjabi Dining Feeling. We ordered the Chicken Pahari Kebab for starters and for entree we ordered the Masala Kulcha and Chicken Rara Punjabi. The kebab and the chicken Punjabi were excellent but I felt masala kulcha could've been better. For dessert we ordered Firni and absolutely fell in love with this. The creamy texture of firni just melted away in mouth. That was the best firni I've had after a long time. The one thing I liked about this  place that you can see the kitchen and what's going on and they have outdoor sitting too. I'll definitely visit again and will taste the other dishes on the menu.

This dhaba serves you the best Punjabi food...
I went with my three friends and we enjoyed the food like anything.. 
* We ordered garlic naan which was amazing...
* Dal makhani you all must try coz it's something to die for.. 
*Pahari kebab was the mild spicy bt juicy kebabs.
* Butter naan was very soft nd the Butter was appropriate not too much so that it comes out of the breads...
*Chicken labadar was tender chicken with richness in the thick Gravy .. that complimented the naans nd dal..
* Then at the end we ordered biryani... suprisingly which had juicy chicken ...
The service deserves üëç coz we got all our orders within 10-15 mins nd the most appreciating part was when we ordered biryani at the end nd we got it within 5mins..
The Interior of the place makes u feel more good nd what better way to enjoy Punjabi food when you have Punjabi songs in the background..  
Lighting, flooring,music,food nd yea the price of the food all deserves üëç...
We ordered so many things bt our bill was arnd 1.5k(including GST)
Gonna be visiting this place again nd again.. nd dis dhaba goes to my fav corner! üëåüëç

Love north Indian food? Then 'balle balle dhaba' is the right place for you to head to. It's located near the Bata exit of the City Center mall. The restaurant has a typical modern Punjabi dhaba look,with Punjabi music in the background. It's generally crowded but the service is quick enough, so do not worry if you have to wait for a while to get a table. You can enjoy great food at a very pocket friendly price.

Being a Chef it is very important to prepare good food n serve good food... so for that i go every food corner to try the bst food as possible... I went to this dhaba near City centre 1 and found it very appealing.. Here I tried kebabs of 2 types along with Garlic naan, chicken butter masala, firhni, salted lassi... And they were very tasty and of very hight quality..!! Me and my friend loved the place and hope to visit the place again...
Cons - They should maintain the place a bit... The chairs have full of rust, water dripping from the A.C, other than that its cool...!!

A perfect Punjabi dhaba which smells of butter when you enter. We had keema naan,butter naan, mutton rarha Punjabi and tawa murgh Kali Mirch. Keema naan could've done with some more keema. The mutton rarha was delicious with a lip-smacking gravy topped with cheese. Not a dish for the fainthearted. The chicken was quite good as well. This place sticks to typical Punjabi fare,no frills,and we were left quite contended as we came out.

Amidst a very aloof lane of Salt lake lies this colourful Dhaba bringing in the colourful flavour of Punjab in an otherwise silent junction .

I went to this place with a friend for lunch and I was overwhelmed with the lively ambience and the Dhaba Wala feel ! 

My review is based on it's spacious ambience , theme , food quality and portion served . 

I had Tandoori Kebab , Tandoori Roti , Lassi and Chicken Bharta .
All of the food was perfectly satisfying and rich in taste .

Pros - 

‚úì Vibrant ambience just catches you by surprise 

‚úìInteriors are fun to look at especially with the wide posters of actors , Singers etc

‚úìTransparent kitchen ! Hence you can see what you eat , Happy me :)

‚úìQuality and Quantity of food is really very good 

Cons - 

‚úì Service can be better and more productive 

I will definitely recommend you to drop into this place  for lunch or dinner with friends , family or special someone , it's worth it !

This restaurant is situated near city centre 1, salt lake. The view from outside of pretty good, once u enter this place, u will see a lot of pictures of the Punjabi community and their achievements all over the place. One new thing I saw that the pictures were also on the ceiling which was pretty innovative and good idea. The staffs here is not much on a polite side. The food quality and quantity is good and the price is also affordable for a regular person. This place remains open till 2:00 am so if u watched a late night movie at city centre 1 or nearest theatres, u can come over here for late dinner or take away. They play good Punjabi songs which will definitely not bore you. Overall experience was quite satisfying.

The interior is amazing with a really nice decor. The punjabi music gives you the dhaba feel. Coming to to food. I ordered chicken tandoori which was so soft and well done. They we had peas pulau which was made perfectly. The butter nun was super soft. We ordered the chicken reshmi butter masala which was really good and tasted amazing. But the only let down was the chicken bharta. It has no taste and I personally didn't like it. But the place is good and I'll visit it again if I get the oppurtunity.

Not worth money. Ambience is good and food is awful. We ordered fish tikka amritsari, butter naan, chicken bharta, mutton biriyani. Fish was hard and over burnt. Biriyani is not comparable at all with the so called biriyani specialist restaurants of kolkata. Not sure if it was the durga puja rush effect but utterly dissapointed with the food.

Sometimes its from the name of a place, you get the idea what it'll be like.More like judging a book by its cover. Many will advise not to but not in this case because "Balle Balle Dhaba" does justice to its name pretty well. Even before entering you start getting the vibe of the place. Punjabi songs blaring from speakers, posters of all sorts with one thing in common- related to something Punjabi- be it films, songs or eminent personalities like Yuvraj, Manmohan Singh and so on. Might seem a bit claustrophobic inside (that's what I felt on a crowded Nabami Night) but they have this cool outdoors to enjoy food as well a breeze. Easy to locate since its on the Main Road nearby City Centre I (I guess I got that right). Enough blabbering about the ambience! (actually its important in this case) Let's head straight to the food.

We had usual North Indian dishes like Chicken Tikka Kebab, Butter Naan, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Tikka Masala. Didn't want to take any risk since it was Puja time and most restaurants fail to meet their standards with even their usual dishes. But BBD didn't fail. It passed with flying colors. The kebabs were perfectly cooked, the dahi-pudina chutney served along always works, hence worked. Now, naans could have been better. They were quite thin crusted and thus wasn't soft at all. But the tikka Masala gravy and Chicken Bharta were delicious. They didn't do anything wrong, just the correct amount of spices, soft succulent chicken pieces (in case of tikka Masala) made perfect company with the naans. We played it safe by ordering safe and ate even better. Extra points for keeping up with the expectation even in the Pujo rush. Will definitely come back to take a bit more risk and try out other dishes. :)

Probably the worst beheviour expected from a restaurant of this manner. Waited outside sitting at the table (temporary installments for Puja rush) for 30 minutes. Then comes probably an owner of some sort or manager, ordered us to sit outside and eat at that table, or to leave the place then and there. Is this the way to treat customers? Especially, who are waiting for 30minutes for our name to be called in. When asked about why such behaviour the person states "Dhang se baat kijiye" as if he is talking in a normal manner.

This dhaba is located near City Centre 1..visited there during puja... this place is well decorated with different frames & lovely interiors and at the background you get to hear loud punjabi music, so you actually get that feeling of visiting a punjabi dhaba..the food was good & staffs were courteous.. overall good experienceüëç

A hidden gem in the mysterious islands of Salt Lake, this place remains open post midnight and serves you some of the amazing and mouth watering dishes! Ordered their biryani, kebabs, kulcha for ent≈ïe and main course, I was bloody surprised by the taste. Expected to be average, I was really pleased with the way the dishes felt in my taste-buds!! Pocket pinch was reasonable and came around 1.2k for 2 people. We also had ordered desserts and a sweet lime soda!

Overall the ambience was decent, it can get extremely crowded but kudos to the management for their efficiency. Nice service and good food with the flavour of Punjab (mostly through their decor & music). This place is a must go and also arguably the best place to visit if you ever have plans of dining in a good food joint in Salt Lake post midnight.

Balle balle dhaba gives u proper dhaba feel. Serves amazing dhaba style food and the ambience around would make u feel that Ure sitting in mid of a dhaba in Punjab. 
We ordered Keema Naan with Kaju chicken bharta, later ordered biriyani. 
Bharta was on point, Keema naan had stuffed Keema in it, though not the best but definitely one of the best. 
Biriyani was amazing, bit oily but great in taste. 
We ended our meal with Phirni and Kulfi. 
Kulfi was typical homemade type and it tasted heaven, Phirni was pretty great too. 
Prompt service and friendly staffs! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal .
Very much recommended! :)

Location: Near City Center 1
Ambiance: Decorated with Frames of Punjabi singers, movies and quotes, quirky and interesting, you can listen to the Punjabi songs playing in the background.
Behavior: The staffs were courteous and friendly, after the lunch we were planning to cut a cake for two of our friends as it was their birthday. The waiter arranged the table for us with delight.
Price and Quantity: I found it a bit overpriced in comparison to the quantity, especially the Rice dishes.

FOOD:
Starters: ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Chicken Pahari Kebab (6pcs/plate) and Fish Tikka Amritsari (5pcs/plate). Both of them ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† were tasty and succulent. The chutney given with it was tangy.
Main course: Butter Naan & Masala Kulcha- soft and tasty
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Kashmiri Polao- Horrible quantity and quality, Paneer Polao- Average
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Chicken Bharta ¬†& Chicken Tikka masala: The chicken was good, but it was the same ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† buttery sweet thick gravy for both the dishes.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tandoori Paneer Butter Masala & Musroom Masala- Again not upto the mark, same ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† sweet buttery gravy with cashew paste. You cannot differentiate between the veg and ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† chicken gravies.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Mutton Rara Punjabi: Well, this was the standout dish. Juicy mutton pieces along with ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† minced mint and dry spicy gravy. The combination of it with Kulcha was awesome.
Overall, I was expecting better experience of the authentic Punjabi dhaba cuisine, which they failed to provide. A moderate experience in total.

This place is located near City Center1 Salt Lake city. The restaurant is prominently visible on the road. The ambiance is totally amazing with a retro punjabi look. The wall and the ceiling are decorated with photos of punjabi actors, singers from Bollywood and sports persons and you'll also get to see the Santa-Banta jokes on the walls which make you laugh while enjoying the food and with a touch of punjabi music. 
Now let's come to the food,  the list is given below :
Starters:
Chicken pahari kabab
Fish tandoori tikka
Main course :
Butter naan
Masala kulcha 
Paneer Tikka butter masala
Mushroom masala
Chicken bharta
Chicken Tikka masala
Mutton raar punjab
Paneer polao 
Kashmiri polao
The starters were amazing . All the dishes were really good(total delicious punjabi cuisine). Although I didn't taste the chicken and mutton dishes but my friends felt that the gravy of all the items were more or less taste same except mutton raar punjab and chicken bharta. According to them mutton raar punjab is one of the best dishes. 
Paneer Tikka masala was good but mushroom masala was not up to the mark. Kashmiri polao and paneer polao were good but it had lots of crushed cashews in it. 
To have an authentic punjabi cuisine one should surely visit to this place. With-

This place has the perfect quirky decor and ambience. Visited last week with a friend for lunch. Although the place was bustling with people the two of us managed to get a seat immediately.

Without haste, we ordered Lassi, Chicken Tangdi Kebab, Butter Naan and Chicken Lababdar. Each of the items tasted lip smacking. Especially the tangdi kebab. Totally salivating right now! The chicken gravy was rich and sinful, just the way I love it.

Verdict - Must visit!!!

Small, nice, well decorated restaurant on which you will find many preecehings on Punjabis. It has a live kitchen facility and servers really really tasty food.

I had good dinner of chicken biriyani and raita as they don't serve raita with biriyani and the taste was awesome.

This is at the back side of city center which can be accessed easily.

Went there with lots of expectation and found it to be a mismanaged outlet. The space is small to begin with. But the plus is they have decorated it well. The outside seating is cool too. Also found their behavior to be friendly. Problem is the pros end here.

The AC don't work. And with such small space inside we were literally sweating even before the food arrived. Food was a mixture of average and below average with bits of good things here and there. Like the kebabs tasted good, but were tough. The place is overpriced too.

In all not at all a good experience. I am not going back anytime soon.

So this place is located just outside city centre. It's a small place with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.The seating arrangement inside is quite clumpsy which was a minus. The decor of the restaurant was full of frames of punjabi movies and singers all over the ceiling and the walls and they had authentic Punjabi songs playing which was cool.
 As the name suggests it serves North Indian food. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chicken rara punjabi, chicken lababdar and some tandoori roti and masala kulcha to go with it. Though the taste of the dishes were good enough, I felt the quantity and the price did not correspond. Overall I was not really satisfied with the food.

Loved this place! Everything from the decor to the food reeks of Punjabiness, exactly what you expect when you hear the name of the restaurant. The interiors are decorated with little cartoons and photos of various famous sardarjis and short sardarji jokes. We tried the chicken lehsooni kebab and the chicken pahari kebab as starters. Both items blew our minds. They tasted different from each other and though rich, was not very spicy. In the main course we had tandoori roti with Butter Chicken which was another delicious affair. The waiters are efficient and the service is pretty good. The cooking is great. All in all, we had an extremely fulfilling meal.

Its a good place to have food with your friends or family. It generally serves typical north Indian dishes with an intense touch of bengali flavour. Tried Chicken Lasoni Kabab and Chicken Biryani. Lasoni kabab was really out of the world but biryani seemed to be little over spicy(taste may vary person to person).

A disappointing experience, food is okay, the management team is pathetic, I visited about 2 months ago, experience wasn't worth sharing hence skipped it. But today I m shocked to see that they got a rating of more than 3.5, which is commendable. And, it also has inclined me to believe, that Kolkata is only left with mediocre eateries. I m just wondering how Balle Balle Dhaba can be a 4 star rated restaurant with such lousy services and mediocre quality of food ...keep up the mediocracy....my apologies...but I can't flow with the wind, hence, 1 star for food, and .5 for the location.

Ambience is cheerfully sunny, youthful and food was  fingerlickingly delicious. Da seating looks cramped however never felt uncomfortable. Infact the interior looked so interestingly cute that i wanted to linger on longer.

As the name suggests it one of a Punjabi kind. Punjabi food is their speciality. Apart from Punjabi food you will also get Mughlai and Continental. The interiors are decorated by the theme of Bollywood.

Pretty crammed seating inside this place with hardly any space to move freely.
Food is okay...just like any ordinary Mughlai restaurant and is quite appetizing.
Presentation is way below par.

Balle baba dhaba is famous for fingerlicking butter chicken,mutton rara punjabi and last but not the least keema naan.The butter chicken was  prepared in an authentic and desi punjabi style.The peices were so soft that they melt as soon as it touches the tongue.Now coming to mutton rara punjabi the gravy was just amazing one can feel the cashew paste within it.The keema naan was soft as well as very tasty.The stuffing inside it made it even more tastier.This is place deserves  visit again again.Only the staff behaviour  was not up to  the mark.

Beginning with interior. I believe it's something different and really captivating. A lot, and I mean a lot of framed photographs adorn the walls and ceiling as well. The space isn't very big that's the only downside. Live Punjab music makes the place really happening. Service is fine too. 
The North Indian served here will linger in your pallets for a long long time. Lip smacking and rich with flavour, the place serves amazing authentic North Indian. Neither too hefty on pocket, amazing experience.

As the name suggest, it's a Punjabi dhaba with Punjabi ambience n Punjabi music is played in background.
The area is too much crowded and congested as tables are not properly arranged. When u'll go in a large group, they have to rearrange the tables.
staffs are not at all friendly and we have to call several times for the order. Also the kitchen was only , u can see the area where they are cooking.
Only North Indian food are good . If u order something else, u'll do it at yr own risk. Also it takes too long to serve food.

With a nice ambience and a beautiful set up of an old Atari station its a bliss to eyes and mind. Coming to the food it can be regarded as a soothe to the taste buds if you are a fan of punjabi cuisines.. moreover the gravies and the tandoors brings out the smell of punjab along with nice hospitality of service... and last but not the least is the lassi which is a must try if you are looking for true taste of punjab

That was the last day of our college training, we planed for a outing after the class, And decided to go this place.Personally I expected much from there, but disapointed with their quality of food.As we entered there in early evening,so took tandoori roti and chicken bharta only for a halka-fulka quick bite.A mbience was good enough, and music was loud punjabi songs. service was acceptable. They should pay attention on their hygenicity and food quality. Good luck!üòä

We took the day special chciken bhati kabab as a starter, nice it was. Then we ordered naan and garlic nan, both were tasty. As a side dish we took chicken bharta (non spicy) and if u want some "chatpata" kind then u can order chicken lababdar like us.
And the  firni was also good along with the Kulfi...

Balle balle dhaba serves good Punjabi food but not the authentic punjabi food and thats where they fall short for me. It is an effort on my body to digest Punjabi food and it when it is not the best for my taste buds, it is a no go for me. Even tandoori mushrooms had loads of cheese in it. Dal was overcooked. Ambience is decent.

Situated right next to City Centre 1, Balle Balle Dhaba is one of the few eateries in Kolkata that serve authentic Punjabi dishes. My love with this place began after I tasted one of their signature dishes, but I will come to that later. 

Ambience - photos of iconic Punjabi pop culture references and jokes adorn the walls and ceiling of the place. Combined with the loud (nothing of discomfort though) Punjabi music, the look and feel is truly unique.
Food - Do try the mutton biriyani, it is as good as can be. For that genuine Punjabi touch, go for the "Keemah Naan", a keemah stuffed paratha which tastes awesome if you partner with egg tarka or chicken bharta. The egg tarka is the perfect blend of spices, not too spicey or too bland. But above all these, Balle Balle Dhaba is famous for one signature dish and that is "Mutton Nalli Kabab". If you love mutton, then Nalli Kabab must be there on your wishlist. Juicey mutton around the leg piece is just melt-in-your-mouth. 

With all these good points, Balle Balle Dhaba lags behind on one thing. The staff is helpful and courteous enough, but they seem too much loaded with tasks or disorganised everytime I visit them. In peak hours, expect to be waiting for 10 mins for just a glass of water. 

Overall, Balle Balle Dhaba is a wonderful food joint, after proper staff training/ planning there will be nothing stopping them from becoming one of the best there is. For all the meat lovers, Nalli Kabab is the salvation.

So this was my second time here. Experience is quite different than the previous one. This place was under renovation a few months back. The food quality and taste has gone way better. I went there with my boyfriend. Dishes ordered: Chicken biryani, chicken reshmi Masala and tandoori roti. Though the price is a bit on the higher side but both the quality and quantity are good. So this time, really happy with the experience.

You can even get ur food customized as in my friend doen't like chillis so I asked them to get the same and they did that also for us. Awesome place. I am basically a bengali but bought up in chandigarh so was looking for a punjabi style place and guess what I got one. Today I finally thought of writing about it. Cheers veeray.

It's located nearby to city centre salt Lake. This place is one of the favourites amongst people who have routined night outs. You can almost see a string of vehicles waiting outside the restaurant. Takeaways are also encouraged in this fooding outlet. The interior decoration is nicely done with a collection of pictures of eminent personalities and their quotes and sardar jokes. The staff is courteous and the food served over here is more than just good. I and my friend had ordered butter rotis, chicken curry and egg curry. Both chicken and egg curry tasted awesome and the butter rotis were nicely made and were soft 
If you are out with your friends at night in saltlake then you can definitely visit this place and enjoy a pocket friendly meal :)

Well it was a pleasant experience there...I went there with my family..and the environment was beautiful except the loud music which didn't suite my taste..The Kashmiri pulao was a big disappointment for me though because it had a strong smell of coconut oil and that is totally opposite of what my taste bud loves. The rest of the dishes- mutton biryani, Tandoori roti, chicken lababdar, chicken tandoori Butter masala, chicken Reshmi kabab, chicken tikka kabab were just perfect. The mutton biryani was sheer bliss to the taste buds and it's a must try for all..and the chicken tikka kabab as well..
The service was also good...

The ambience is unique. Never seen a dhaba promoting Punjabiness like this; which is amazing. Sarcasm not intended. The dhaba is extremely colurful and the tracks (Punjabi)  that keep on playing add a difference to the place.

Nothing to specify as such. They serve good food.

All the dishes were very tasty and was value of money.. Price is affordable and one would actually love this place. The only problem was the space. It's a bit small for crowded days and for big groups waiting time becomes longer.. Overall a great experience.

An examplar of Punjabi dhaba(themed) restaurant is what sums up this place. Visited this place almost a month ago. Located just near city center 1. The name Balle Balle Dhaba is enough to make one fathom about the kind of food stuff this place treats.
Both the interior and the exterior captured my brain. The decoration is spectacular. Nonetheless, I throughly loved this place. Though a bit exorbitant but that's okay in terms of the extra-ordinarily delicious foods they served us.
We ordered tandoori chicken as the starter, a plate of both mutton and chicken biryani, and chicken tikka masala with tandoori rotis for the main courses.

My friends and I popped into here today for my girlfriend's birthday treat and I must say the ambience reverberates everything Punjabi. The decor is funky Punjabi with all the great Punjabis and merchandise adorning every nooks and crannies, including the tables.
We had mutton biryani which was moist but was very subtle in terms of flavour but the mutton piece was soft and well cooked. The chicken reshmi kebab was also very soft with very kittle charr from the tandoor and had flavours which were not overpowering. The chicken malai was probably one the best dish of the day and had amazing flavours, though it was much on the milder, sweeter side of things. But the chicken tikka butter masala takes the crown for the day. The gravy was dense and the flavours felt to be true to Punjab and the chicken pieces were very well seasoned.
It was a good lunch and the staff were cordial and prompt as well. On an ending note, I want to thank them for playing non-stop Bollywood songs of the 90s. :D

Kabuli naan was full of nuts and it tastes really good . All the food was served nicely and was tasty. The person who helped us serving our food was kind enough to ask us quite a no of time if the food was tasty . Really loved the overall experience.

One of the best dhabas in salt lake city. Situated near city centre. Has a nice ambience and gives the perfect dhaba vibe. This particular dhaba stays open till midnight which is a pretty good option for the ones who love late night rides.¬†

Coming to the food we had ordered-
ADDONS-- butter naan, plain naan and green salad.

1.MUTTON ROGAN JOSH--it was extremely delicious but at the same time extremely spicy. Goes perfectly with naans and kulchas. A must try dish here.

2.CHICKEN RESHMI MASALA-- The chicken was well cooked and soft. The creamy buttery texture of the dish and its "reshmi" feeling will surely make your tastebuds fall in love wiht the dish.

3. KULFI-- they make nice and tasty malai kulfs, with lots of pistachios in it. A sweet dessert to try here when at the dhaba.

A nice place to hangout with family and/or friends. The staff members were quick and very courteous.¬†

Yesterday for the first time i visited this place. I heard about this place from one of my friend so at last went there.As I am foodie and i like to explore new places so it was not a bad experience..But certainly they still need some improvement.
Some plus points of this place:
1.Awesome environment.The background music,the colorful interior will definitely make you happy.
2.Food was good..I ordered Chicken reshmi kabab,Paneer pulao,butter chicken,Lassi..All the dishes were delicious..But they are little oily. Lassi was no doubt good.
3.Service was very quick.That's really a plus point.
4.Place was clean.
Some points they should improve:
1.They didn't offer to serve on plate.
2.sometime you may feel the place is very loud and congested.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†It was a nice experience for me..I would like visit there again to try their other food items.Thank you.

A Punjabi themed restaurant near City centre salt lake. It has a funky dec√≥r with lots of movie poster . We ordered special mutton biriyani and chicken pahari kebab . Biriyani was good , the chicken was tender and perfectly spiced and yummy . Will try their rest of the menu soon.

Have been to this place many a times. It has a quintessential dhaba ambience. Coming to the food it's neither too good nor too bad.
Tasted most of their dishes. The service here is commendable. 
I like their starters and lassi very much.
The biriyani is not up to the mark.
But you can always drop by this place once im a while.

Balle Balle Dhaba is one of my favourite places. I have visited this place many times and I was never disappointed. Who doesn't like Punjabi food ? This place serves you typical Punjabi delicacies which are just fab in taste.

The place looks amazing. The decor is too good their walls are filled with photo frames which makes the place look cool. And to top it all they play peppy punjabi songs which makes your dining experience even better.

Coming to the food I personally love there Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Butter Masala with Butter Naan or Tandoori roti. These dishes are my favourite and I mostly order these whenever I visit. The ambience is good, they have friendly staff and the pocket pinch is also not that high.

All in all this place is really good. So if you are a foodie this place is a must try for you.

Visited Balle Balle dhaba yesterday for dinner. Slightly overpriced I'd say. The interior is completely like a dhaba. No such ambiance to talk about. Coming to the food, we had Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Mutton Boti Kabab. The kababs were really nice. Then we had Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka Masala. The biryani was good but quantity was less for 200 rupees. The side dish didn't taste that much good.. Also, I had a Kulfi. And it was nice. Overall, a nice place to try tasty kababs. Will visit again with more money :P

Ordered mutton boti kabab,chicken pahari kabab. Then we had keema nun,mutton biriyani,fish tikka masala,chicken lababdar. Food is tasty and enough in quantity.

The interior is lively and colourful. They have used vines to create a full-length fence like structure. It is beautiful and refreshing. Food was moderate. We ordered methi paratha, lachha paratha, kulcha and chicken tikka butter masala. The chicken tikka masala was delicious but the parathas disappointed. Service is painfully slow but the restaurant manager does his best to resolve issues if a guest complains. The best part is it stays open till late at night.

The ambience is really nice considering that this place caters to those who go out in search of food when everyone else has closed their doors. The service is very slow but the manager strives to put things right. The chicken tikka masala was good but the paranthas were different in not so pleasant a way and could have been done better.

Oye Balle Balle Dhaba is just the right place for a family casual dinner. Or hanging out with friends. I f u are a die hard Punjabi food lover, a visit to BBD is a must. The ambience is very cosy and relaxed. The entire joint is decorated with Punjabi personalities pictures, phrases, iconic moments and nostalgic images. I always wondered how the food would be there, so I went there today and had a fab time. The food is really tasty and steaming hot. I ordered half Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Biriyani and a plate of Mutton Rogan Josh. the food was exceedingly well cooked and the meet was juicy and supple. Pocket pinch is also not that high! Satisfied to the core!

Once you go out you like to feel comfortable and peaceful after a tough day at work! Even with great interiors, ACS not working properly and it is hot and humid inside the restaurant as well. Vegeterian menu options are very less and the out of 3 one will not be available. Masala papad with masala sprinkled like salt! Ordered paneer 2 pyaza and mushroom mutter. These dishes are meant to not to be sweet but what was served was completely different. What was astonishing was onions are not served unless you ask for it! Next the waiters make faces at you when you ask them to change dishes after starters!! Very bad experience..will not visit this place again!

Disappointed 
Location: Easy to locate as it is near city centre.
Ambience: Walls are adorned with Bollywood pictures and looks nice, otherwise it is just like normal restaurant.
Food: Based on location and the external ambience, I thought food will be finger licking. But it was a big disappointment from food to lassi in the end. Tandoori, paneer butter masala and zeera rice were the worst I have ever tasted. Garlic naan, Aloo do pyaaza and dal fry were eatable. Lassi was too sweet and watery.
Service: Waiters seemed to be in too much hurry, as they twice came up with bowls even before we finished.

It was a Friday dinner and out of all places i chose for this one which was a bad decision.
I have tried out this oulet right after it came into function and after that it was on 7th April( sorry for the late review)

Ambience:-When i went there in the beginning they used to play punjabi/bollwood songs however this time they had the IPL match on which is understandable.It will give u a decorate dhaba feel with all these posters from flims and few funny quotes,narrow passages between tables which one can manage keeping the name in mind.

Food:-Here comes the worst part.This time we ordered for Butter chicken,Dal makhani and Butter roti.
Butter Chicken:- There were 4 small pieces of chicken in a thick red gravy with melted butter on it.We asked to make it spicy and it was up to the mark.Taste was  just like other small pickup shops with a higher price.The pieces of chicken were small,on a semi soft side and with that price the quantity is not satisfactory at all.
They don't have any other option other than 2/4 pc which is strange.

Dal Makhani:- Yuck!! is the word that will come to your mind if you would have tasted that.It was dal floating in a semi thick redish gravy(rather warm water). Its strange to have this kind of taste that to when you add the word "Dhaba" to your food chain. Disgusting it was.

Butter Roti:- It is way smaller than the regular size that you will get in other restaurants and was also very thin compared to others.The only good thing was lots of butter was applied on it.

Services:-Average time was taken.

Overall:- High priced in context of quantity and quality.

Kebabs are nice to start with and if you are a mutton lover like me, then try out the nalli kebab.. must say it is really a  wow dish.Not many restaurants in Kolkata serve it, do can give a try. Chicken kebabs are also good.

Service- **even worst than rhe food quality. Waited till 30mins to give my order even though the restaurant was little or no crowded.

I am wondering why am i even forced to give single rating. 
PATHETIC! WORST EXPERIENCE! 
Jai Hind Dhaba is much much and much better@ option. Would never recommend anyone. 
Poor and stale quality of food with unprofessional waiters and unhygienic dining area. 
Rs. 928 full wasted. It would have bene better if i'd have given this to some street vendor for street food.

This resturant has a good location and thats what attracts many people to visit this place. The food here is good. You must try the Chicken kebabs as i found them to be really tender n yummy. Get your hands on some palak paneer. I would advise you not to order biriyani as it isn't upto mark compared to the rest places. Overall service is quick n ambience is good too.

Recently visited this Dhaba on a late night out with some buddies. The place has a very welcoming feel to it and you can hear loud punjabi music blasting outside which further adds to the punjabi ambience they look to create. The walls are adorned with various photos, jokes etc. The kitchen has an open glass facade which looks really nice. Now coming to the food:

Paneer Tikka - Well marinated and well charred in the tandoor. Great taste and a definite try for the vegetarians
Chicken tikka - Again a good dish, definitely order it
Mutton tikka - I can't recollect for the life of me the exact name of this dish but it tasted well, the only complaint being the mutton didn't have enough fat and hence wasn't too soft to eat
Dal Makhani - Perfect kaali daal, no complaints here
Chicken butter masala - fragrant gravy, soft pieces of chicken and a lot of ¬†butter! Absolutely loved it!
The breads were all soft and fresh

I definitely recommend this place and I sure as hell will be visiting here more often.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram and Facebook. (Same name in both places)

Worst restaurant i have ever been too !!!
Not a good experience at all !!!
Absolutely no room at all. No ventilation. Feels sick when you get in. Furnishing is terrible. Low level metal chairs with '0' comfort. Decoration is kind of strange.
After all this i thought maybe the food will be good. Unfortunately i was wrong.
The Chicken Biryani was medium quality, low in quantity and doesn't even have an egg in it. Definitely not worth Rs.200/-
The Phirni was nowhere near its original recipe. Again quantity was very low. Flavours were not there.

In main course we ordered motton biriyani, chicken rara Punjabi and butter nun. Biriyani was lil bit oily otherwise all items are perfectly cooked and taste was just mind blowing.
Lastly we ordered lassi. I can never forget the taste of their lassi. Salty as well as sweet. Very refreshing it was.
Staffs are very helpful and courteous. Overall had a great Sunday over there.

One of the best places to have biryani in salt lake. Go for the special biryani which is quiet economical and is sufficient for 2 people. The dishes I liked most were biryani, chicken lababdar, chicken Pahari kabab, chicken tandoori. The outside decor of this joint is beautiful however in the inside it is a bit clumsy.

Went to the place with my GF. The decorations of the restaurant is just mind blowing.. staff behavior also good , overall ambience is pretty decent.
Only reason for giving this pathetic rating is the food quality.
We ordered lacha paratha, butter num and chicken bharta. There was hardly any difference between lacha paratha & butter nun & also very hard like stone. 
Chicken bharta was also very cheap in quality but expensive in price. 

So what's the point of good decorations if food quality is bad.

If you want to have some good North Indian food in salt lake then this is the place you should visit. It is located near City Center,Salt Lake. The ambience of this place is average but the service is bit on a slower side. We ordered Chicken Lababdar, Tawa Gosht, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani and Garlic Naan.
The food was properly cooked and the taste was just perfect. Tawa Gosht is highly recommended for Mutton lovers !

An absolutely amazing experience :)
The ambiance itself says that it is a typical Punjabi restaurant. The food was equally good.
Chicken Reshmi Kebab- Really good. Served with green chutney. A bit on the spicy side but definitely I have a palette too mild. But definitely worth a try :)
Butter naan and tandoori roti- Nothing special but not bad either.
Chicken lababdar- Really stole the show. Amazing blend of flavours and spices. The chicken was just as tender as it should be.Tastes heavenly with naan. <3
Chicken biriyani - Delicious? Definitely. Out of this world? Not really.
Masala cold drinks- Could have been much better :)

They charge a lot of tax and that's a negative. Total bill came out to be approx 1000 for the 3 of us. The staffs are really courteous. Not at all difficult to locate if you are a regular City Centre 1 visitor.

their food tastes awesome, they implemented the true authentic punjabi cuisine one can relish with joy.
it will be much appreciated, if they don't compromise in aspect of QUANTITY.
Just a thing that needs to taken care is PARKING, their parking needs to uplifted because the road infront of the restaurant faces the traffic of CITY CENTER. ¬† ¬† ¬†

Worth a visit.

On the night of Dol we just hopped into this place,just next to City Center 1.We were assuming there would be a long queue for eternity. Instead we were shocked to get immediate seats on such a day of celebration at the peak dinner hour!
Ambience- attempted to transform the place into a sophisticated dhaba (i understand it's an oxymoron). I didn't like the screeching sound the iron chairs made. The distance between the adjacent tables aren't sufficient. The kitchen is open. You would find the entire interiors made up of Punjabi movie scenes and Punjabi trivia. You may choose to sit outside as well.
Food- Heard so much about their Tandoori Chicken that we decided to go for it at once. Oh God! Such a disappointment!! The chicken was dry, no spices could be tasted at all.The spices haven't got inside the chicken at all. So tasteless!! I would never recommend anyone to try tandoori chicken here.
Even the accompaniment, pudina chutney tasted bland.
Next orders include butter tandoori nan,butter tandoori roti and Chicken Rara Punjabi.
The roti and nan both were good and plenty of butter was smeared all over both.
The Chicken Rara Punjabi was good. Definitely rich in spices.Two pieces of chicken served in a gravy of mutton keema with finely grated egg all over.
Service- Quick. On informing the waiter of the tasteless chicken tandoori he apologized.
Pocket pinch- Normal,nothing extraordinary. A dinner of two would come below 1000.

Good ambience with great food within your budget. The kebabs are a must have along with north Indian dishes. Very few places in kolkata where you get pudina paratha and methi paratha.

This place in the Salt lake area within the vicinity of City Centre Mall gives ¬†us the fabulous opportunity to taste it's Punjabi dishes in the air of Kolkata city. Totally a fabulous combo with touch of Punjabi music with it. I've been there in last week and had a fabulous dinner in fabulous lightning and ambiance of the place. Their food feels like you're either in Punjab or in Delhi. Loved their Laccha Parantha's and Makai Palak thing.

After watching Logan this Sunday (5th March) we, a  group of 7 were Hungry and was looking for a place to feast.. So decided to check out this place since it was our first try out. We had to wait for a table and the staff made sure we got a place for 7.  We ordered for Biryanis , chicken bharta and few others.. The food was amazing. I felt Gajar ka halwa could have been better. Overall Loved the arrangements and the service was good.. 
Though the staff wasnt happy since we didnt tip them but then why should we, since we were charged with high service tax.  Anyways overall an amazing place to try out Indian delicacies.

Nothing strikes closer to home, but some GREAT Indian food. Even a conscious feinschmecker would ask you to dig into some Desi North Indian richness when time calls for it.
I have been meaning to visit this Punjabi-relevance emphasized Dhaba for quite a while and nothing's better than sudden cravings. 
Locating this place is no sweat at all, just one step away from CC1 on same foot. 
Outside seating catches eye with its surroundings ornated by flowery creepers and climbers. We preferred to seat inside since it was rather hot. Now this is what I've heard most about the Dhaba apart from good food. The entire place is covered by something related to Punjab/Punjabi in frames. Irregularly regular in arrangements, this provides a refreshing look to the concept of Dhaba. A job well done!

Coming to edibles. 
Started with Lassi. A perfect play of salt and sweet, this clearly re-assured us of an effective coping mechanism against the trailer of Summer season that is coming. 
Pahari Kebab, was tender but didn't pack that great a punch. Was a decent appetiser.
Chicken Lababdar, now this though.
They could easily add an adjective and call it Chicken Lajawab Lababdar. Everything seems underwhelming when a bite of this richness cushioned with butter naan touches your tongue. The gravy triumphs the field of taste buds. Lajawab, yes it has earned it.
Butter naan, served fresh and soft was a near perfect complement to its perfect accompaniment.
Kulfi, however was more like frozen kheer. No complaints about the taste. Well I don't mind a variant. Served as a pretty great dessert.

A fulfilling eat, so much so. I'd definitely recommend a visit.
Until we meet again!

Its a well nicely decorated place, but i found it a bit small. The tables are just placed next to each other which doesnt give u much privacy. 
Coming to the food we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala, daal makhani, butter roti, salad nd sweet lassi. 
The food was great nd very tasty, the lassi could have been a bit sweeter. 
Otherwise it was perfect. üòä

Went to this place last weekend to try out the North Indian cuisine. The ambiance was fantastic and the place was brightly lit up and had a very energetic vibe to it. It was a sunday evening so the place was jam packed. Food however was not up to the mark both in terms of quality and quantity  and could have been much better and was probably a bit over priced also. The saving grace for the place was its wonderful ambiance and can definitely be tried.

I visited this place for once somedays after Durga Puja last year. The place was moderately crowded . Their ambience is okayish. After finding a seat we had to wait for long for the staffs to take the order. Even after taking the orders they were not responding properly. Again another long wait for food. Quality of food was average and quantity wise it was not much satisfying.

Name itself sounds like Punjabi style or Punjabi cuisine,you gonna see many sardar ji here ‚ò∫
We order ..butter naan , makai palak & mutton roganjosh ( gajar ka halwa was not available).
We were 2 and trust me guys quantity was much more sufficient for 2 or it can be easily gulp by 3 .
Makai palak was very smooth in texture and perfectly cooked ( just loved it) ..
Loved the food and the Punjabi songs especially..
Won't gonna say about interior or decor coz we were outside.

Nothing much to add about the place, it is one of the places that judging from the decor one would expect to have good food here and they more or less live up to the expectations. They offer the usual menu available with all other dhabas out there. However, taste wise,although its pretty good, it doesnt take the top spot for me. Quantity is good enough, ambiance is also pretty good. The only thing I felt can improve is the service

We've also had the Chicken bharta and Chicken tikka butter masala which was decent. But if you want a wholesome north Indian meal,this place is the answer!

I was here with one of my friends on a rainy day and the scrumptious food really complemented the weather. We sat outside and that actually gave it the 'dhaba' feel. We ordered chicken bharta, chicken lababdar, dal makhani and garlic naan. I can honestly say that we felt full, both in stomach and heart when we left the place. The food was delicious. The place truly lives up to its 'dhaba' tag!

Well this might be coming quite late as this restaurant by now is quite popular and an established brand in the food scene of Salt Lake and Kolkata.¬† However I owe a review about this place simply because they have continued to serve great North Indian food for quite some time now. 

What I really like about this place is

1. Location: Just on the car parking exit gate of City Center I. This is unbeatable simply because being easily accessible on one hand and it provides very convenient car parking place on the other, its the closest one could get to a drive-in restaurant in such a busy traffic intersection.

2. Ambience: It begins right when you are in the vicinity of this joint, you will be greeted by a superb collection of Hindi and Punjabi songs, so in case one is also a music aficionado you get to know about the latest trend in that segment as well. Once you get in, one is treated with a host of pictures, stills and cartoons which bring out the true Punjabi inclination of this place, where-in it exudes the pride with which the owners have developed this place in a very light manner. Even if the food wasn't as great as it is now, one would still like to visit this place for the sheer pleasure of the interiors where you are greeted by jokes, some Punjabi trivia and the open kitchen where-in you find chefs preparing the food you ordered in a very neat and hygienic manner 

3. Food Quality: I am a hardcore non-vegetarian so anything that is not vegan is good for me and I am always biased towards it. Yet it would not be right on my part to not to mention that they take the experience to a whole different level. Their kebabs like chicken tikka, reshmi, hara-bhara, fish amritsari, mutton nalli are worth writing a book so wouldn't delve much into it. However there are two more counts on which I would like to mention. One is biryani, it is the best most tasteful and elegantly prepared in the most healthy manner a biryani could be cooked in, I have come across in Kolkata; The other is assortment of veg kebabs, which I will recommend very strongly may be ordered, such as veg hara bhara, dahi kebab and if you like mushrooms then mushroom tikka.
To bring a closure to this matter I would like to add that my in-laws are hard-core Punjabis from Amritsar and once they were here in Kolkata, had taken them to most of the famous North-Indian serving joints in town and it was here at Balle Balle Dhaba they were floored by the food quality and were pretty happy that atleast they got something to eat which in food terms was as good as what you get in Amritsar, Punjab.

4. Service: The stewards are really good and helpful, given the high foot-fall this joint attracts they try and do the best they could to serve you that¬† too with a smile and great eagerness to ensure you have a great time.

Finally, as I said I owed this place a review so did try to some it up as briefly as possible yet the review now reads like minutes of a symposium so my apologies for this yet a thank you if read the entire piece and found it helpful in any manner.

Warm Regards

This is very near to the City Center, and is almost popular with the crowd. The ambience is vibrant and mood lifting with innumerable posters hanging on the walls. The menu is not too vast which is always a good thing. Loved their house speciality of Chicken Banjara Kebabs, along with Tandoori Aloo and Keema Naan. The portions are decent, the only complaint is that the chicken was a bit overcooked. The Naan was especially good. The prices are medium cheap and inclusive of taxes.

What I loved from this place was the keema mattar and the chicken reshmi kebabs, absolute melt in the mouths!
The best part?
Stays open at 2:00 AM in the night to fulfill those midnights cravings.

Located just outside of cc1, the place boasts of a variety of delicacies blended perfectly to give it an Indian touch. 
Biryani and/or butter chicken with masala kulcha.
Thr kebabs are also very good and the  lassi is a must:)

The modern day Dhaba! Booming punjabi music and fancy cars greeted me to this outlet at Salt Lake. A cold winter night, the zesty ambience,an exuberant crowd and kebabs in the see through open kitchen got me salivating. The Reshmi Kebabs were wonderful. Was surprised to find that they did not serve it with the traditional pudina chutney.

The Butter Chicken was dissapointing. Nothing great. They weren't too generous with the quantity. Had to order a plate of Chicken Bharta too. The excess of turmeric powder and cashew paste spoiled the taste The Masala cola at the end of the meal was refreshing though. 
The service was decent. Not the kind of place one would like to keep coming back to.

Situated beside cc1 a nice place to try out... The dhaba ambiance and nyc dacor is a plus point along with the loud music played... Perfect punjabi food,laccha paratha is a must try ...we tried butter chicken along with it which was well up to the mark....and price is also reasonable... So go for it

Let me start with the amazing thing here and that's the food. Oh My God! if you want to have really authentic north indian food just go there you dont need to spend crazy amount of money and the food you is really worth it. I tried the biryani, chicken lababdar, butter chicken, rice, and butter naan and also lassi. All the dishes were spot on. Now, the downside The Service it is too late. we waited 15 minutes to get water like we were kind of ¬†pissed off a little and then there was a problem in billing but the food makes up for ¬†it. And of ciurse the ambience is a plus point of this place...Overall its was above average for me just because the food was really good....

Best food 

Punjabi punch 

And a classy interior 

All the ceiling is filled with photos something which i haven't seen before.

The price of the food is also nice .

The tsate and a special touch of class in the masalas can be felt .

A hot shot contender for the top slot....

Headed to this dhaba style restaurant in search of some punjabi dhaba tasty food and was not disappointed at all. We ordered winter special Makai ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag and both were delicious. The rotis were perfectly cooked but was more oily than expected.Chicken Reshmi Masala had more of a sour-tangy taste.
Interesting interior, with photos and frames highlighting the pride of Punjab.
Food is worth the money, although service is a little sluggish here.

We went there after watching a film. Were really hungry so we decided to crash here. We really took it to be a great restaurant looking at all the interiors and looks. But they let us down. There was no one to take down our menu and nobody was there to even ask us for water. The food was strictly ok. The only positive thing was the quantity. A very average restaurant. Avoid.

Totally disappointed...!!
After reading all good reviews over zomato for North Indian food n all, finally visited the place. The places is only good in looks.
We orders dahi kabab for staters and dal makhanai and butter naan for main course, dahi kabab was damn oily n to much salty, dal was like my old hostel mess totally taste less and naan was thick as it could be...!!
The service as pathetic as was the food, no one care to serve it. The place was not much crowded that service can be compromised...

Bad bad place.

To start with food no doubt it was tasty., now coming to the hygiene it was worst, water glass were not properly cleaned.The waiter was unhygienic, He served the food with NASTY Hands. It was most disgusting, apart from that i just asked him do u accept the card he said yes and before placing the order he asked me to pay the bloody bill.
  

   OVERALL --- UNHYGIENIC, BAD SERVICE, CHEAP          STAFF  @

Suggestion -- NEVER GOING TO VISIT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN. 

People don't visit there untill u want to eat waiter's NOSE butter.

The place tries very hard to please with its ambience. Perhaps its even a little successful with its whacky one liners and desi photos and caricatures plastered all over the place. On the whole, cool decor and satisfactory seating. The food here is pretty good!! Right from the laughs you have reading the menu to the end of your meal, you should be satisfied.

Here are some things you can try:

Methi mattar malai ****

Chicken bharta

Daal makhani

May be a take away option is better but thr inside atmosphere is very clumsy, dirty. I would rather love to visit a road side dhaba on the highways.   Keeping it at the last option if food is not available anywhere else.

The place is well decorated and tries to give you a feeling of a dhaba with the Bollywood connect. However this place was extremely cramped with the service being very poor. The waiter's are even reluctant to serve the water on time. 

Coming to the food, the starters were excellent. The food was very good though a bit oily. However I would recommend the chicken starters as it was very fresh and juicy with the right amount of tanginess.

Though this place is situated in a very prime location, just beside city center1, I sincerely feel Balle Balle Dhaba needs to pull the socks up for it's own good. A dhaba style restaurant with clumsy ambience and quirky decor (I didn't like the wannabe dhabaish atmosphere), you can hangout here with friends for hours as they take a hell lot of time to serve the food even if the house is not full. 
Food is average ..only the lassi is good. Portion is good. Price and service okayish. 

P.S. Hygiene factor needs a check.

We stumbled upon this dhaba when we decided to ditch the food court at CC1. This place is amazingly done in terms of the ambience. Pictures hung onto the ceiling as well. Rarely does a dhaba mesmerise you this much. 
However, not every pretty looking place serve great food. Visited with a bunch of friends, quite sometime back. We took chicken biryani, chicken butter masala and kebab too. Kebab was nice, really nice. Butter masala was decent enough. What I didn't like was biryani. Naturally after having biryani at other good places, you would not like to have biryani here that too for about 200. Apart from that, there are good reasons to visit this place.
Our bill was around 1k. 
Looking forward to trying out other items too.

Its good for take aways. The quantity is good and quality is fine, but the price is high compared to the rest of the dhabas of the same level.

It was closed down for a bit, and have not had food after that, so cant really comment if the quality is the same which i had before it was shut.

This place is very near my home, so the craving for the tadka daal and roti is often quenched here... They do make a mean egg tadka and butter roti. But the rest of the food is pretty average. Typical dhaba food. The kebabs and Biryani and salans are very average. They do make some good lassi. 
USP: the place is open till late night and pocket pinch is moderate. 
However they do take really long to deliver or pack the takeaways.

Located just beside the Bata Store outside Citi Centre, one can easily locate this outlet. The restaurant is divided into two sections. A well decorated seating on the outside and an AC section inside. Ambience is average, but interiors are very simple and comforting. Service is pretty quick and I really loved the food. Starting from the kebabs, to the main course was brilliant. Not to mention, the Yellow Dal Amritsari and Fish Dopiyaza have become my favourites. Would suggest you all to try these out.

Feels good to be back...... Cheers!

We ordered chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, firni and masala cold drinks. The biryani tasted really good and the chicken piece was decent in size and not very hard. Chicken tikka was the best one..the gravy was yummy and the chickens were rightly cooked with 5 pieces. The firni tasted very average as it was bit dry and not that creamy. 
Will definitely visit again.

I Went there for a quick bite in the afternoon.
There was no problem in getting a table.Service was quick.
We ordered Egg Tarka and Tandoori Roti. The Roti was good, very crispy and straight out from the tandoor.However I found the Egg Tarka quite bland.It lacked the usual dhaba flavour, and frankly it was quite tasteless.
Kudos for the decor though.
Prices are alright, considering they're inclusive of taxes , and the quantity's more than sufficient.
Would like to try the kababs and other North Indian fare some other time.Hopefully they will be better.

This place is a nightmare to visit. I visited this place last night with my husband hoping to find some good north indian food but had to walk off mid- dinner because of their food quality and service. I ordered Shahi paneer and mix raita only, which took an unexceptional delay to be served. Moreover, the raita served was too salty to taste, which on complaining was taken back but not served again. The sabzi was cold as hell, and the staff was roaming around with no interest in the customers. You call one steward, he will ask another one to entertain your table resulting in nobody actually hearing your concerns. Nothing worse have I ever seen than this food outlet.

It was on a Wednesday afternoon that we decided to go to Balle Balle dhaba for lunch. My friend had heard the place had re-opened after a month long renovation and the food is quite good there.  

As we entered the place was moderately crowded but there were a table or two available and we were immediately seated. The decor consisted of everything Punjabi , from portraits Raja Ranjit Singh to the contemporary Punjabi singers and movie posters. The place was quirky yet quite comfortable quite reminiscent of the Dhaba like feel.

The service was quick abd courteous. We had ordered Butter Naan , Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala (half) and the food was delicious. The Nasn was soft and soothed the taste buds and the chicken full of flavours. The desert consisted of firni which again was lip smacking good. The prices were quite reasonable again .

Overall a great experience. Wpuld love to go back again soon! If you want North Indian food for dinner in a cosy atmosphere at reasonable rates this is wurely the place to be !

D place is shabby nd too congested 
Coming to the food ,  we ordered for chicken reshmi kebab (which was soft and tender ), tandoori roti (nice and crisp),  egg tadka (was a little high on spice), green salad and had parcel of chicken biriyani and chicken tikka kebab. Biriyani tasted good but was too spicy nd kebab was nice and moist. Overall d food was nice and service was quick but the rates came down on the ambience. Will not visit for second tym surely!

We visit there during Durga Puja... So no chance of getting inside but atleast better than the other restaurant who asked us to ¬†wait for 2 hours minimum. We somehow make ourselves comfortable outside.. N thank God we did so otherwise I would missed the feel of amazing road side dhaba..!! The loud Punjabi music, the collection of photo frames (from YoYo Honey Singh to Milkha Sinkh) almost covered the walls.. Coming to the food.. Well balanced food with north-indian tadka along with those Punjabi beats is something I was looking for in my town and thought of getting it only in Punjab, but all these proved me wrong.. ¬†But my only concerned is with the seating arrangement inside... Apart from that everything was good.. Looking forward for more visits..

The food is excellent in this restaurant but that's the only positive thing about it. The service is just about ok with waiters struggling with orders & customers during the Durga Puja. The tables were extremely dirty as the staff weren't putting in an effort to clean them due to the rush of customers.  However, the food is truly great & thus my rating of 3.

Located just beside city centre 1, a very convinient location. Food is good. But the waiters messes up a lot, the orders are frequently misplaced. Anyways we had chicken butter masala, mutton roganjosh along with butter roti. The roti has really some space for improvement, being a hardcore punjabi dhaba the place should really serve better rotis. I've been to amritsar once and the butter roti made by punjabis is a treat to the taste buds. The bill came inclusive of vat so when u look at the price keep that in mind. Food was good, decoration was really good!! If the staffs are trained in a better way this will be really a good place for indian food with the punjabi feel.

What a disappointment!!!! Had visited this place only ONCE, and that's enough to not go back again. The biriyani they served was smelly and cold, clearly leftover stuff. They had no kebabs, no tandoori chicken to offer. Why keep it open then!!!

This dhaba is located around CC1. Stepped in after a tiring day of pandal hopping for some wholesome and tasty food. It sure lived up to the expectation!

Ambiance:
Loud, crowded and bright! The dhaba is all things lively. Bright walls with interesting pictures, posters and write-ups. It's a little too congested. The seating is very limited. There's some outdoor seating, not quite an ideal idea in the summers. Some catchy music and people talking fills up the spaces.

Food:
The chicken reshmi kebab is juicy and soft and tastes pretty good with green chutney.
The tandoori rotis are best with the chicken lababdar. It's slightly spicy and the chicken is absolutely succulent. The chicken biryani is not bad at all. Quite like the Kolkata biryani, less on spice and a lot on flavors. 

Service: 
Very quick service and the staff is very polite. Value for money? Yes! 

An average place for casual dinners. Worth another visit.

Located near city centre 1 this place offers good quality food at reasonable rate. I went there with my family yesterday. We liked the food we ordered( peas polau, malai matar, mutton Rogan Josh and chicken kabab and a butter nun.) The malai matar was delicious and best among others. Ambience was good. But there were flies buzzing around the table. Moreover during puja days they kept their card machine not working. So these aspects should be looked upon.

Good food good ambiance and at a decent price. I received undercooked chicken kebab but considering the pressure in puja time i am willing to let it off without a negative impression for I have also been told by my friends that this does not happen other times. Their biriyani is really good with moist and juicy mutton and kolkata biriyani aroma. Their pahari kebab and chicken lababdar were the other two dishes I had chance to try and both were tasty. I found a difference in taste of lababdar since here it was a little more spicy than I had in elsewhere but overall the taste was good...and they deserve the good rating.

I just started my Durga Puja Vacation in Kolkata and for the first night dinner I opted for Balle Balle.
Very conveniently located just behind City Center 1, entrance is catchy.
The first thing I liked is the wall and roof full of Punjab reflections, but the disappointment was jokes on Sardarji... Come on Guys, not fare.
Food, not so excellent but definitely good, was not able to win my heart as I had far better Punjabi food during my 4 year haul at Jalandhar.
Mutton Rogan Josh, Seems Kadai gravy is used for Rogan Josh preparation as well, not recommended.
Tandoori Rooti, Good in texture, size and taste.
Chicken Reshmi Kabab, good, but think of reducing the curd content in marinating, that spoiled the taste towards sour.
Paneer Butter Masala, excellent, Paneer size was good.
Firni, very good in taste and flavor.

Another disappointment was in every dhaba we get the reddish onion in Vineger, that was missing. I asked for that, but no.

Cost, 970 for 3, which is not so expensive but not economical as well.

This place gives a perfect dhaba feel. Their quality of food is excellent. I've tried their Butter nan, Chicken Bharta, Murg Malai, Butter Chicken, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Pahari Kabab and Mutton Boti Kabab. Every dish is extremely delicious, well cooked and served as piping hot. But the little disappointment for me was, I felt the place is less spacious. One might feel a bit congested when they have a full house. They must make this place more spacious and more comfortable.

Located just beside City Centre 1 in Salt Lake, Balle Balle Dhaba is one of the best restaurants for North Indian cuisine in this area. We were there on the New Year night this year around 2am and even during those late hours, that too in such a rush, they didn't compromise on the quality of food and service one little bit. It was actually quite notable!! Great service! The food over here....it's yummmm!! I simply loved their Chicken Tikka Masala..it's fab!! Being open till 2am itself is a real treat to all the late nighters around!! The major part of the restaunt has got indoor seating arrangement while they also provide a small outdoor one. Had quite a good experience over here!! :)

Who doesn't like dhaba food? Especially when the dhaba is pretty and the food is delicious. Balle Balle Dhaba is not your usual dhaba place. It has a wall full of photo frames that would leave your eyes exploring for more and food that would make you want to come back for more.

Coming to food, I am particularly fond of their Butter Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala. The meat they serve is tender and falls apart in one bite. The naan bread made here are tasty. When I'm not in the mood for breads, I order their Biyani, which is equally as tasty as the above mentioned items.

This dhaba spot is decorated in a fashionable way with a fast working staff team. The food is perfect. This place is a true hidden gem.

A decent place for only families or large groups to have delicious and mouth watering north indian food, Balle Balle dhaba scores high in terms of its authentic  dhaba style north indian food. However, the very few occasions of slow service and loud and unpleasant atmosphere make it a so so place overall. Food üëå, ambience maybe yes, maybe no.

Balle balle dhaba is just at a stone's throw form city centre,saltlake.  This place is done up in a very interesting manner. Brightly lit with recent bloc buster music this place is noisy and always full of poeple. It brings out the classic north indian and punjab flavours. The walls and the ceilings are adorned with photos of punjabi artists and punjabi memes. The staff is extremely good and courteous . The food has the classic north indian touch. The bara kebab and  the boti kebab are extremely soft and tender. The other good thing u about this place is it is open end till 2 o clock in the night. Perfect place for our midnight cravings. Surely a must visit. :)

This restaurant is a stone's throw away from where I live. Have been to this place quite a few times. The food undoubtedly is delicious. Tandoori chicken, Chicken butter masala, Shahi paneer, Kashmiri Aloo dum the list goes on. This place was temporarily closed for few months but now they are back again. The service is one thumb down as the waiters are pretty slow in taking and delivering orders. But one of the major reasons why I love this place is because it is open till 2 a.m in the night.

However this place is very noisy.Now I don't blame the dhaba for his ,its the people.So not an ideal place for a date.Come with your friends and family you will have a great time :)
Service was pretty average though.

Utterly rude staffs... I ordered Chicken Tandoori in a takeaway order and other items also but when i got home and opened the containers and aluminium foils to serve the guests the tandoori was totally burnt and black! I called them and they said "aisa nahi ho sakta humlog check kar ke dete hai"! After a few arguments they told me to come to then and that they will replace it... I got it replaced as my home is nearby but just imagine what would be the case if I lived somewhere far! Never suggested for home delivery or takeaway...

First visit to this place. 

The Chicken Tandoori, was very good as compared to most of the dhabas, in and around the city. 

Mutton Adrak-e-Pujne: I generally avoid eating mutton at resturants, because once you are dealing with red meat, its very easy to create a disaster rather than a dish. But this is by far the best mutton dish that i have tasted ever, at any resturant. A must order item. 

Chicken Biryani: If you love your biryani as much as i do, then as soon as you take the first spoonful, you will be struck with a sense of familiarity. The biryani they served, tasted all to similar to that of Arsalan, (the one they used to serve in the early 2000's). The one that had made Arsalan a household name for Biryani. The biryani at Balle Balle Dhaba is an exact replica of that biryani. Or atleast i felt so. All in all a must try also. 

P.S. With so many eateries mushrooming at almost every corner of the city, this place is really a refreshing change. After a long time, did i feel that the food was worth every penny.

Located opposite to Andromeda building in Sector 1 salt lake is this cute little dhaba. ¬†A place which made me fall in love with vegetarian food. I took yellow dal amritsari, kadhai ¬†paneer and chicken kassa, butter naan, paneer pulao and peas pulao. The daal and paneer was just awesome with perfect balance of spices. The rice was great. No oil dripping from naan and yet a fragrance of butter prevailed. To be honest chicken did not quite suit my palate. The interior decor is beautiful with all the photos of Punjabi celebs and movies. ¬†A great place to have food. The rating given is just to make a non vegetarian fall in love with veg food.

Situated near City Center, Salt Lake, just two minutes walk from City Center. Me and my foodie friend stopped at Balle Balle Dhaba one afternoon when we went to shopping at CC1.
Balle Balle Dhaba which is temporarily closed now serves really good North Indian delicacies. I went there seeing reviews in Zomato and I must say they do serve a good quality food. And the quantity was also fine.
The entire interior is decorated with the theme of Punjab which is really beautiful.
We had biryani which was really good.

Lets's start with the ambiance. Just to prove that its a Punjabi Dhaba, one doesn't need to play loud music. It was a big turn off. We had to ask a waiter to turn down the volume. The decor a tad bit crowded with pictures all over the wall. Now the food was good. The Mutton Biriyani was ample and delicious and the mutton side dish we had ordered was well prepared and lip smacking. The Tandoori chicken was welll prepared too, only that i hoped it would be better if it would have been a little bit juicy. It was a tad bit on the drier side. The only other turn off was that the tandori roti they served was made of "atta" which at other places are made of "maida'"and tastes better. Over all an ok experience. The best part is that it is pocket friendly.

This is just located beside the city centre 1 bata showroom. They have both outdoor open space dinning as well as indoor dinning in AC.
the decoration of the restaurant is with full essence of punjabi tadka. It's very colourful and with different bollywood film (those are based on punjabi community or character ) posters and pictures are hung on the wall to enhance the beauty and energetic ambience of the resto.
Tandoori chicken is too good else than almost every dish is yummy n authentic. Courtesy of service is well maintained. Service is fast incase the day is not a festive one.

The new craze in salt lake locality, Balle balle dhaba is an amazing break from the regualr dhabas. It has finger licking good food with a old school, simple family restaurant type interiors with movie tags on a dedicated wall. It can be used as a timepass to read the movie dialogues till the time they serve.
Yes.... They take ages to serve as it is over crowded at night and during weekends. But the taste is worth the wait !!

Good dhaba feel in this place. Plus a proud feeling for the Punjabi visitors! They have Punjabi personalities posters all around the place, also on the ceiling! There is always a queue outside this place. Being a vegetarian,was expecting typical dhaba yumm north Indian, but was disappointed. It was more of Bengali food taste. Also disinterested staff adds to your disappointment..

The moment you step into the restaurant, you notice the Dhaba theme, with Punjabi songs playing in the background. 

Coming to food: Q2, meaning good quality and quantity.
Try the tangy and filling Mutton Nalli Kebab.
¬†Biryani is good, but a bit oily.¬†
Satisfy your sweet craving with the delicious kulfi.

Pros: Open till late at night ÔÅä

Quick Tip: Don‚Äôt order too much food at the same time ‚Äì first check the quantity and then go head.
¬†Pack the excess, please don‚Äôt waste food!

Located just on the back side of City Center it can be found easily. A true blue Sikh would be delighted to enter this place. The decor is fabulous with beautiful wall hangings and decorations all giving the "Punjab wala feeling." The staff was extremely courteous and hospitable. We ordered Chicken Lababdar and Masala Kulchas which filled us to the brim so much so that we could not complete the whole food. The chicken was tender and really cooked well. It went well with the Kulcha too. Overall, a great ambience and a good value for money. Highly recommended :)

Brief: Recommended for casual dining (affected North Indian Cuisine), at a value price point, in Kolkata ‚Äì Salt Lake area.

The rocking name had once drawn me into this eatery on a work day for lunch. I found the nuance of North Indian at a delectable variance from the usual mish-mash serving same in Kolkata. Of course North Indian cuisine served across the city is quite different from what one actually savours in the northern states of India. 

The establishment is located conveniently very close to City Center Mall and yet discreetly away from the consequential privations of being in a mall. The ambience is of course more sophisticated than a highway dhaba, but maintains the tradition of a visible tandoor and cooking area. Otherwise the feel is that of a casual diner with a deliberate sardar centric theme of displays, including ones conveying sardar angst. The establishment also has dining tables set out in an inviting porch with lot of greenery creating the ambience of a garden, on the footpath in front. This could be a nice dining place on a winter afternoon, if one does not mind the dust from the road in front. Inside, the setting is a bit congested and on the Sunday afternoon when the place was abuzz with diners, it was difficult squeezing through the aisle with the 42 inches of pride I strut around with me.

The place seemed to be very popular, as we had to wait a bit to get a table. The choice was Paneer Butter Masala and Tandoori Chicken Butter Masala. The Paneer Butter Masala served was a delectable preparation of paneer in a pale yellow gravy (reminding me of Kardhi), mild in spices and preserved the taste of paneer. Paneer Butter Masala is almost a generic dish in any North Indian restaurant, but here the rendition was very distinct from the usual paneer served in over spiced muddy gravy. The Tandoori chicken in gravy is again an intelligent innovation to transform this popular starter into a main dish.

On this Sunday afternoon however, the most sought after dish seemed to be Biryani. The waiters were just flying out of the kitchen with loads of this fascinating favourite of Kolkatans. I am not sure if this is a speciality of this establishment or a generic favourite in this city.

The servings were very generous, and we carried home portions we couldn‚Äôt finish.

Lunch for two @ 707/- (with mineral water but without dessert) was very pocket friendly.

Ordered take away , butter nun , dal makhani , and chicken bharta for home. Nothing extraordinary ,though all eatable. The dal makhani was sweet , i am not sure why ..maybe the use of excess cream . The chicken was tender and fresh.. Nun was good and thankfully not rubbery. 
Have heard a lot about nalli kebab , will give it a try soon

When every food station is closed in the city ,you will be finding this open.üòÑHence it is featured in Late night eateries. Specialised in North Indian aka Punjabi dishes and they excell.Their mutton rogan josh is to die for.Quick service.Decorated all over with some punjabi quotations and Picturesque of the punjabi movies.Few seats for outdoor seating is also available.A very pocket friendly place with some mouth watering plates.

Balle balle with its leafy boudoir and colorful eyecatching interiors is always warm n welcoming with prompt service and delicious fingerlicking food. The menu consists of familiar crowdpleasers and the quality of the food is robustly flavorful. A great place to catch up with friends, family amidst flaky naans and creamy smoky kababs.

we went there on a hot evening for dinner. the place was packed. when we entered, the thematic ambience pleased us, but after sometime we found the place suffocating-maybe for the weather, or the air conditioners were not working properly. coming to the food, the kashmiri pulao and chicken reshmi butter masala tasted average, a little pricey for the food.

This was my first visit to this place. A nice dhaba themed restaurant serving north-indian specially punjabi dishes. Service is very prompt & staffs are courteous. Coming to the food, a bit over-priced according to the standard of the food. We ordered chicken pahari kebab..this item was good. A new kind of flavour with a touch of mint & pudina in it the kebab tasted nice & the chutney served along with the kebab was mouthwatering. Chicken biryani somehow didn't taste like biryani. It was kind of bland! Then comes the mutton roganjosh..this item was delicious! The kulfi was tasty. Overall a nice dining experience except for the price factor. Prices of few items could have been a bit on the lower side.

Yesterday night I have visited the place with great expectation...but somehow I was disappointed...queue was not huge...waiting time took 15 mins....what disappointed me is the inside... AC ventilation was not working and water drooped from AC outlet inside...inside was too hot...next is hygiene... Tables were rubbed with a dirty cleaning towel..so too much frustrated..
Now Food...chicken hariwali kababs were over burnt...then we ordered Dal makhani...Tandoori roti and Mutton Rara Punjab..Most of the bread items were unavailable...makhani is good... Though I liked the gravy preparation of Mutton but pieces are not good...hard and chewy...though requested and they changed the plate... Appreciate the behaviour...my whole rating is only for this activity...lastly we ordered koolfi and taste very average... Overall it's ok but not as per my expectation.

It was a discovery at 1:30 am in the night and proved to be a good one. The place has a different kind of feel as the very concept of latenight eatouts is an upcoming trend in the city. We ordered for a quick meal and service was the only turnoff, as they took more than 40 mins to get the food. The butter naan was mouth melting one of the best in the recent times that I can think of rest of order were equally good. In total I enjoyed the place and look forward to visit again and this time would surely try on some tandoori.

The decor goes with their theme.But the service quality is poor.Also the place looked very unhygenic.There was a leakage in AC for which the entire spot was watery .
The food was good though except the pahari kabab which was overcooked.Overall the experience was satisfactory but not up to the mark.

We went there on  a hot  Sunday to have lunch with friends. 
Loved the ambience and the food was above average but there are some issues which the authority should take notice. Firstly, the hygiene factor; when we asked them to pour cold water they simply took our glasses (when we have already taken a sip from the glass) and poured it into the jar and later on poured the same water into our glasses. We had no clue why that person did that.
Lastly, when we paid the bill they didn't include the cost of 4 lime sodas , later on they issued a new one after insisting that we want a separate bill. However,  they again charged extra vat.
Please next time onwards take care of such factors.

For a casual lunch and dinning, this is a good place to try. Had tandoori roti, naan, dal makhani & chicken bharta. Tandoori roti was just ok, naan was good, dal makhani was also ok, & lastly the chicken bharta, was also good.
But as i mentioned, its a place for a casual meal, ie. not for food lovers who look into the deep aspects about the food (they might not get satisfied).
I would like to visit that place once again.

I liked the garlic naan ,masala kulcha n the chicken tikka masala the most.

Situated right opposite City Centre Saltlake my visit to Balle Balle Dhaba was quite satisfactory. Though there's not much space inside but the decoration isn't compensated for that. The Dhaba has got a lot of posters from gadar to horn ok please which gives the good old Punjabi feel when you step into the place. The stuff were quick with the order. The service was okay. Coming to the food, we went with a handi biriyani, butter chicken and tandoori roti. The butter chicken was delicious and the biriyani was just. My friend ended the meal with butter lassi and she was happy with her glass. All in all, you can surely ditch the places in CC for lunch once and visit this one.

A perfect place to have authentic panjabi food at reasonable rates. Me and my college chum pallav roy went there to have lunch there and ordered plain naan , murgh malai and tandoori aloo butter masala.. the naans were delightful ,they just melted in my mouth , murgh malai was a tad too sweet for my taste but was nonetheless different and surprisingly not greasy,the winner for me,surprisingly was the tandoori aloo !! Nicely done, with just the right amount of spices and butter it was lip smacking for sure!! Definitely highly recommended and worth visiting again.

If you want to ruin your evening and pay for it please visit this place. They dont know if tap water can be chilled. So you get the hotter option. They ran out of butter BUTTER!!!!!! Mind you! How the hell can a punjabi restruant ran out of butter? That's like a punjabi dhaba not serving alcohol! Yeah speaking of which, balle dosent serves that as well which isn't that big a problem. But you have it in display!! Why will you have alcohol display in display if cant serve it??? Overall having food here is like watching love story 2050 for the second time. NOONE DOES IT!

Quirky punjabi decor. It's unique to have them placed all over the ceiling and walls. This place is a great visual delight!  Coming to the food, we ordered - chicken reshmi kebabs,chicken tikka kebab and paneer tikka as starters, garlic nan with dal makhni and chicken tikka butter masala and lime sodas. The service was a tad bit slow,maybe because of the crowd and also, one major drawback was a bit of inefficiency in their services when it came to the lime sodas. Two of us had to change it twice because they served it  salty when we had asked for sweet.
Other than that, brilliant ambience and decently priced. Coming back atleast once more and hope to recieve a better service.

Visited this place a few weeks back. Located just beside City Centre 1, the best thing about this place is the ambience and the decor. The whole place is well decorated with posters of films all over the walls and even on the ceiling with both indoor and outdoor seating facility. We ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Rara Punjabi and Tandoori rotis. The tandoori Chicken was too good. The chicken side dish (containing lots of minced eggs) is also good with a spicy punjabi taste. But compared to taste of food, the prices are on the higher side. The staffs were well behaved, though they took a lot of time while serving and taking the orders.

There should be an option to give negative rating to a restaurant.

I mean just pathetic pathetic service.

Asked for water that too  5-6 times. Got it after 25 mins. After the food and everything arrived. Wad dying out of thirst. I suppose they did not have sufficient glasses. I mean seriously. You don't have glasses in a well established restaurant.

Ordered for sweet and salted soda, it was all salted though.

Nobody was bothered to listen to you. 

Worst experience.

The restaurant located right next to City Centre, salt lake.Open till late at night.The posters in the restaurants are quite interesting with nicely decorated with a Punjabi look and feel to it.Decent food and good service and the staffs were friendly as well.

We Ordered : Chicken bharta,chicken tikka kebab,tandoori roti..
The Kebabs were hard, bharta was a bit spicy and not that good.

Overall experience was good.Prices are higher than it should have been
But they need to improve their food quality a bit.
It is a decent place for late night hangout with friends.

Food is okay. Went there with family for dinner on the occasion of an acquaintance's marriage anniversary. We had pudina paratha, butter naan, shahi paneer, plain basmati rice, yellow dal Amritsari, butter chicken, egg curry and firni. If one is looking for some late night Punjabi dhaba-style North Indian food served hot and fresh, then one should pay a visit to this homely dhaba. Interior decor is well-decked, a bit kitschy. A rather crowded place with the problem of space crunch, but outdoor eating arrangement's available and one can relaxingly enjoy some Punjabi cuisine, watching the vehicles rushing by and people ambling on the street. Overall, a cool place to eat out after a long, busy day with friends, colleagues or family. But if one is looking for some quality food, like tastefully cooked, well-garnished dishes served in an ambiance akin to fine dining in a fancy restaurant, then one would be disappointed.

Disappointed with the overall experience. Waiters are distracted and don't really care. It was hard to locate them even to ask for tissues. Ambience is nice but that's all that I liked. Food was average at best - ordered jeera "pulao" and chicken rara Punjabi. The quantity of pulao would be sufficient for one at most. Secondly it was no pulao just rice fried with jeera - loads of jeera! And that's all I could taste. Chicken rara Punjabi was average. Overall not recommended.

A small restaurant with a fancy decor it happened to be. Totally enjoyed the food. We had some chicken kebab, the name of which I do not specifically remember at the moment ( greenish in colour served with onion salad ) , mutton biryani and chicken lababdar along with it. Perfect taste. Though doesn't extend over a huge area, ambiance is good. Service was satisfactory as well. Location wise, it is the easiest thing on the planet to detect. 2 minutes from the Salt Lake City Center 1. Also, I've heard it is open till/beyond midnight which comes as an added bonus!

Had always seen hordes of people @ BBD every day while comming back from office . Had a chance to go yesterday for lunch. Good thing was the place was pretty empty and sitting was theme based !!¬† Service is so so and waiters tend not to complement each other (if you order any item to another waiter other than the waiter for your table, the waiter smiles but effectively the order is not taken or casscaded..you are left waiting for the item!!)Comming to food:Lassi is atrade mark of any dhaba and we wanted to order it but its not available :( so had to contend with those masala cold drinks which you find in any outlet.The chicken tangri kebab is really good but honest I found over priced (200 INR for 2 pcs)We had also ordered fish tikka (bhetki), though the quatity was good I/we have serious reservation of it being bhetki--it tasted like basa !! The main course was pretty decent esp the Tadka and garlic /butter naan/ malai kofta is worth mentioning. Another guy had order biriyani and he was decently satisfied. I don't know if I am correct but mutton tadka ought to have minced mutton but here you get small bonny pieces of mutton. but overall the taste is good.Chicken Bharta / Chicken tikka / Paneer do pyaza masala is really delicious and I would recomend ordering it.For desserts we had ordered Kulfi malai and it was good with rooafza topping (but took pretty long to serve). Worth ordering it.We had order more than what we could eat and had ordered to pack the untouched ones. While comming out we forgot to collect it and neither did the restru guys remind any of us(14¬†members)¬†to take it or bring it to the table before we left. This might have been an one off incident but avoiding these might help to instill more customer confidence considering its a good place to dine in.

We visited this place on the occasion of saraswati puja and it was fairly crowded when we reached! We had to wait for about roughly 10 -15 minutes to get a table and in this regard the management should be abit more competent and attentive in allocating the tables since there was a waiting line outside and you can't just allot the tables according to your personal discretion!
                                       Keeping this aside the food was quite good! We had ordered a lassi, a chicken biriyani and a chicken pahari kebab! The kebab was excellent and the biriyani was also well prepared but the service was abit on the slower side.
                                The only areas which need a fair bit of improvement is the service and a bit of attention needs to be given to the cleanliness of the restaurant! No complaints regarding the food since it lived up to my expectations!

I visited this place in a hurry. Was very hungry at that time and didn't think twice and ordered their mutton biriyani straight. Biriyani was really good but really it was a bit costly.

Unique name for a restaurant....the ambience inside is also unique. This place glorifies Punjabis as a community for all their great achievements with movie posters and photos of great people of the community adorning the walls and the ceiling.
This place had been on my list for a long time and it felt nice to be finally here.
Coming to the food...we ordered Mutton Adrak ke Panje, Mutton Biryani, Mutton Rogan Josh and Tandoori Rotis.
Each and every item was really enjoyable. The mutton Biryani although not a classical one, but was quite delicious. One item that stood out was the Mutton Adrak ke Panje....really unique. Rogan Josh was excellent too. No complaints regarding the food. We had come to this place with great expectations and our expectations were met. The service...a tad bit slow and nonchalant at times was a put off. We had ordered Fresh Lime soda and our tables being right next to the kitchen,  we observed that the soda was being served bit by bit from half filled bottles. We took up the matter but the boy kept arguing that the bottles were fresh. As expected the Fresh lime Soda that was served was without fizz. So a -1 for that. Every bit of detail should be well taken care of, starting from the drinks to the food....otherwise the completeness of the dining experience is lost.
All in all a nice place to go to if you are in Sector 1 of Salt Lake.

The nearest indian restaurant from my home... Had gone for online ordering... Firstly hats off to zomato for online order service... This was the most systematic service i have come across...  The food was delivered on time... 
Tandoori chicken was delicious... But felt the pieces were very small... For main course butter naan ,  daal makhani and chicken butter masala was ordered.... Daal makhani was okay.... I had higher expectations.... Please improve daal makhani because this is one of the core dishes in indian cuisine... Chicken butter masala was quite good.... 
Service was quite quick(5/5)..... 
A little improvement can attract more n more people since it is just beside the city centre mall....

I was planning to visit this place for quite sometime, at last I got the opportunity few weeks back with a group of foodie friends. I was more interested to experience the colorful quirky ambiance rather than the typical north Indian food. My experience with the ambiance was as per my expectations and my assumption about the food was bang on. Let us check out what these assumptions were and why they were proved to be correct.

LOCATION - - - - - This place is located right on the main road near City Centre, Saltlake. It is outside the City Centre complex opposite the Vasan Eye Care Clinic. You can park your car inside the City Centre complex or on the main road near the restaurant. 

AMBIANCE - - - - - This is the best part. The vibrant and colorful ambiance has been build up using one basic element ‚Äì neatly framed photographs of various popular contemporary Punjabi personalities, but mostly they have movie stills where Punjabis are glorified or which are immensely popular across the country or abroad. These framed photographs adorn the walls as well as the ceilings! Yes, the ceiling filled up with framed photographs gives this place its quirky look along with the rib-tickling punch lines written all over. Even the table tops are hand painted which adds to the colorful and vibrancy quotient of this place. Apart from this really adorable indoor ambiance, this eatery has got a lovely outdoor seating area which has only got a couple of tables but it is neat, classic yet arty. I will add a bonus 0.5 point for this overall lively ambiance.

FOOD - - - - - Now coming to the food, my assumption was this place serves a bit above average north Indian food that goes well even with the Bengalis and there will be nothing out-of-the-world, and yes my assumption was true in every sense. Even at places I found there is loads of room for improvement. Here are the items we ordered for ‚Äì

a) Garlic Naan ‚Äì The garlic naan was really nice to start with, it was soft and fresh and very garlicky. You can have this garlic naan here rather than having anything else like tandoori roti, etc.

b) Chicken Lababdar ‚Äì It was nice, tangy to go with the naan but the tanginess was bit too much according to me, the chicken piece which I got was bit stiff and overall I won‚Äôt go for this again.

c) Chicken Biriyani ‚Äì A plateful of Bengali style biriyani served with a semi-soft potato and a hard piece of chicken breast which I could not finish. Infact the chicken piece was so hard and tasteless inside I could not have more than a quarter of it. I guess the chicken was not even marinated, there was not a hint of aroma or flavor inside. The rice of the Bengali biriyani was nice and flavorful though it can‚Äôt be compared to big biriyani houses like Aminia or Arsalan. There was no egg and the potato should have been more tasty and well cooked. The quantity was good but the overall feedback would definitely be much below average, and this plate of Chicken biriyani will cost you INR 200 plus taxes!     

d) Mutton Biriyani ‚Äì The same above story of Chicken biriyani can be repeated for the mutton biriyani, only the piece of mutton was better prepared than the chicken piece.

e) Butter Naan ‚Äì This was pretty average and as expected it was soft and filling. 

f) Chicken Bharta ‚Äì The quantity of this item was really good, considering it is bharta you can manage to have your roti even with a bit of it. It was nice and tasty but could have been more aromatic. The shredded chicken pieces were generous though and well prepared.  

g) Egg Tarka ‚Äì It was bit too hot when I tasted it, so the taste was bit eclisped in there. But overall it was nice and tasty and not too spicy, tastes great with some dash of lemon.

h) Tandoori Roti ‚Äì It was really not soft and was more like a papad after 5 minutes. Won‚Äôt go for this again, though it should have been good since this is one of the most basic itmes at a ‚Äòdhaba‚Äô!

i) Mutton Roganjosh ‚Äì My friends had this along with naan and they said this to be good and well prepared, can‚Äôt comment more on this.

But no onion, green chilli or lemon was provided along with so many dishes which is quite basic and common at a road-side ‚Äòdhaba‚Äô! These stuffs enhance the taste of your food and will only do good if provided, also the customer will have a feel-good factor when these are provided complimentary. If roadside dhabas can afford then this big city restaurant surely can!

SERVICE - - - - - Though the name has a ‚Äòdhaba‚Äô in it but the service lacks the warmth which you will find in a road-side dhaba. Here the servers are good order-takers but they can be more interactive and friendly I guess. The service time was pretty acceptable though. But since this place is open till late night I won‚Äôt hesitate to offer brownie points for that fact. 

Coming to the taxes charged ‚Äì you need to pay 14.5% VAT plus 5.8% Service Tax extra on top of the prices printed in menu card.

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.6/5
Food quality: 3.2/5
Food presentation: 3.4/5
Value for money: 3.3/5
Ambiance: 4.1/5
Service: 3.5/5

Overall a bit expensive ‚Äòdhaba‚Äô in terms of the quality of the food served and warmth of the service provided. But I guess the nice vibrant ambiance covers up a bit. Nice place to have North Indian food if you are at Saltlake Sector-1, especially if it is getting late at night.

Cheers!

Ordered Butter Roti, Chicken Lababdaar & Chicken Biryani with Sweet Lime Soda. What left me shocked was the quality of rotis they served despite being a Punjabi themed restaurant. They were crunchy and tasted nothing like soft North-Indian fulkaas. Also, the Sweet Lime Soda was just a glass of sweetened water with no trace of lime or soda. The only saving grace was the ambience and Chicken Lababdaar.

Great ambience. Lip-smackingly good food at reasonable price. Their Rogan Josh(a mutton dish) is a must-try. Punjabi-themed restaurant, the real feels of a North-Indian Dhaba. Definitely would go there again in the near future. Worthwhile for us, college students, to give treats to our friends.

If you are passing by this corner in saltlake tje bright colours of balle balle dhaba is bound to catch your attention. Any time of the day , you pass by theres a buzz sround this place. Its also open till late night. So in our last annual visit to kolkata we decided no more passing by - let's get in.
Food is good ,as usually is .we ordered for a chicken starter, dal makhni , butter chicken,tandori rate. All standard punjabi staples. 
What I noticed price is at par with Bangalore's.

Been to this place for a office birthday lunch party. Just adjacent to city centre, this is one busy food joint.

We went around 2 pm. The restaurant was well Punjabi themed with walls covered in various photo binds. Mostly Punjab related. Balle balle it is !!!

Ambience was crowdy and lively. We ordered keema naan, chicken special biriyani, mutton shahi qorma, chicken lababdar, garlic naan, mutton roganjosh and to finish we ordered chilled lassi and fantastic tasty kulfi.

All the foods tasted nice and made light, so none of us complained.

Biriyani was a bit oily, but can live with it.

Special mention to be made for keema naan and kulfi. Kulfi was awesome.

Will visit again to try some other food delicacies.

Recommended.

Location: Right next to City Centre, salt lake.
Ambience: The entire place (ceilings and walls) is decorated with framed Punjabi Musicians, Actors and Movies based on Punjab. There is provision for both outdoor and indoor seating.
Food: We ordered butter naan, tandoori roti and Chicken lababdar. The food was quite tasty. Thumbs up!!
Cost: It is towards the costly side. 300 for a 5 piece chicken side dish is expensive.

All-in-all, the experience was quite good :)

Had heard about it and went there for a Sunday lunch. The place is really crammed up, with hardly any place to move in between the 2 tables side by side. Chairs are made out of steel which is like so uncomfortable.  Food is ok, nothing spectacular. But the quantity is really less for the price. We had to call the waiters a number of times before they could come and take our order. Took a long time to serve too. The decor is the only thing that's good in this place!

I visited the place a year ago. And reviewing on that basis. The place may have improved by this time. 
According to me the space crunch is a big problem. They should have arranged less tables within that space. Ambience is good enough. Coming to food the place is no extraordinary. Of course the foods taste good but they take a lot of time to serve which is obviously a point to be noted.
Overall a good place at a good pocket pinch.

We had tandoori chicken, chicken bharta, chicken reshmi masala, chicken tikka masala and tandoori rotis. All the dishes were well cooked.. but tikka masala was a bit over spicy. Nevertheless, had a great time. Will visit again :-)

Winters mean sarson ka saag and chicken tikka. N I was searching for a good Punjabi dhaba with a nice ambience for having these two dishes. This place fulfilled all the criterions. It is full of Punjabi movies, both Bollywood n regional, Punjabi jokes which brings a humorous touch to the decor. Coming to the food, we ordered butter nan, sarson ka saag, jeera pulao and chicken tikka masala. All of them were highly delicious. However it is a bit overpriced. A little cutting on the VAT n other prices, and this place shall be crowded like hell. Hope to visit it again soon. Overall quite a nice experience!

Finally visited this place after reading about it soooo much and seeing all the Facebook tags. We entered into this lovely colorful brightly done up restaurant that immediately sets your taste buds craving. But not for long coz a basic chicken Bharta and roti were enough to put us off. Not tasty and definitely not value for money. Yes the kebabs were okay but that will not make me travel all the way to salt lake and visit them again. Hope they take note and improve. Wish them well.

Then we had ordered Kadhai panner and Garlic naan along with Chicken butter masala.
The texture and aroma of Kadhai Paneer was mesmerizing. Garlic naan was perfectly cooked. Chicken Butter Masala was also great. The chicken pieces were perfectly cooked, the amount of butter was optimum in  use and not overused which made the dish awesome.

An awesome place to go for a change. Located near the City centre 2, this place offers delicious food, punjabi style. We tried the Chicken Lasooni kebab, Chicken Rara Punjabi, Kahmiri Aloo dum, Garlic Naan and Sweet lassi. Mmm... The food was delicious. Chicken lasooni kebab was soft and real good. Chicken Rara punjabi was the heaviest item;even when it was just 2 pieces of chicken, it consisted of eggs minced and cut into small pieces and contributed to the gravy's thickness. The Garlic naan was something hakte, that i had never seen in any other restaurants before. It consisted of teel, and was extremely soft and tasty. Kashmiri Aloo dum and lassi were just okay. Would like to recommend this to each and every one of you who plan to visit this restaurant, try the Chicken Rara Punjabi, Chicken Lasooni kebab and the Garlic naan.

The first thing one notices upon entering this place is the decor. It has a full punjabi power house feel to it n whichever direction you look( even on the roof) u find framed photos of punjabi one liners, sardars, movies and a hell lot of sunny deol! The place is not very big but arranged quite smartly. The live kitchen( not literally,but a feel of it) is something i personally enjoyed here. I and my friend went around  5 in the evening, and being an odd time, the place was empty. We were extremely hungry and quickly ordered for chicken tikka masala, one butter naan and a masala kulcha. The chicken tikla masala was chicken with a medium spicy curry and a lot of aroma, which i liked a lot.There was 5 pieces of chicken. The naan was a big one and had ample butter n we were so filled by it that there was no place left for the masala kulcha. However,the masala kulcha was just average. The filling was not good and it was just like ordinary one. One dissapointing thing which i found about this place is that they did not give any complementary salad with the dishes and we had to order one separately. Come on! A salad just comprising of onion and lemon can be easily made complementary whn a place has the word 'dhaba' inherently attached with its name. Our bill was around 487. This place is enjoyable who are fans of north indian cuisine. As for me, maybe not again,but this is just due to my personal preference of other cuisines over north indian one.

I had a take away for my husband.. the keema stuffed naan seemed as if it was stuffed with lots of gram flour and keema in small ratio.. and the fish tikka which the server suggest and said it is bhetki .. but at my surprise after having the first bit it tasted horrible.. that fish is surely anything but not bhetki.. 
Pls change the quality of fish or else dont claim to sell bhetki..
Being a bengali we r very paticular about fish

Jst near City Centre 1 , Balle dhaba attracted us by its colourful name plate at its front ... we visited there for a post birthday celebration at evening and got a table after waiting for 15 -20 minutes...
   Balle balle dhaba has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements... 
    After getting inside ... we were overwhelmed by its whole decoration ... the punjabi photos hanging from the walls and ceiling and punjabi words written here there ... overall it just give a punjabi dhaba ambience... 
   Now coming to the punjabi tastes , Foods are really tasty and mouth watering... we ordered many items... among those Chicken rara punjabi , Mutton rara punjabi , kadhai prawn, chicken tarka, keema naan , Boti kebab and kulfi are the best... Rara punjabi with keema naan was too scrumptious...Polao was normal...
  Another attraction is the kitchen which is in the middle... and surrounded by glass ... so you can watch cooks cooking in their style ...
#A feeling of Real Punjabi Dhaba

One thing that will immediately attract anyone to this place is its name written in bold red yellow green color.
This place offers both indoor and outdoor seating but we chose to sit outside because of claustrophobic little room inside. They have got open kitchen something that I haven't seen before. 
Coming to the food, food here is decent. We ordered paneer butter masala, palak corn and in breads masala kulcha, keema naan and garlic naan. Keema naan was over sweet. So we did not enjoy it as much as we did other breads. Palak corn was very well prepared and was spicy too. 
Mitthe vich we had FIRNI. It's made of gur and tasted excellent. I'd love to go back to have another one of those. 
I'll give this place 3 stars ‚ú®

Having gone there simply because our 1st choice of Santa's Fantasea being closed, we were plesantly surprised at the experience.... The ambience is nice! Photo frames all over the place including the ceilings! The steel chairs and wooden benches add to the dhaba like feel.  Impressive decor if you are not claustrophobic as the low ceiling and dark colors make you feel a little hemmed in. Coming to the food we were not dissappointed at all! Tandoori chicken was at its succulent best! The lababdar chicken was spicy deliciousness and the nans were soft. The keema nun though could have used a bit more stuffing.  The mutton rogan josh was nice but not something you would recommend after trying the lababdar chicken. The only thing holding my review back from giving this a 4 star is the service. Food takes a while to arrive and though that would have been acceptable, you really should not be asking for water and tissues at 5 in the evening when there are only 2 tables occupied! But a nice place when all is put together.

Located right outside City Centre, Salt Lake, this is really a nice experience for all Noth Indian food lovers. Especially if you love the rich taste of Dhaba food.

Nicely decorated with a punjabi look and feel to it, this places gived u ou Dhaba vibes right from the word go.

Talking of food, we ordered Tandoori Chicken Full, Chicken Lababdar, Mutton Roganjosh, Tandoori Roti and Keema Nun. The meat preparations were really good especially the chickens had a tikka-ish taste but a bit different from a tikka. Roganjosh was a bit on the chilly side but loved it.

As of the Keema Nun, was expected a bit more stuffing inside. The Tandoori Chicken was yummmy. Juicy and tender. Loved it.

Would have given it a 4 but service was a bit slow.

Okay Balle Balle dhaba is the counterpart of Honey da Dhaba and Jaisalmer as they are all owned by a same group. The food is good,chaotic ambience as the space is cramped,decor is typical dhaba types. One matter of concern for balle balle dhaba is that their food is never consistent,sometimes its too good sometimes its below average,it is understandable that the cooks arent robots but to maintain a ceratain taste is necessary,that it lacks!
Nevermind if you wanna go their you should! Try the kebabs they are awesome and for sure have Their tarka s they are awesome as well.
It is pocket pinching but then its open till midnight so you gotta compromise somthing.

This has been one of the recent upstarts nearby City Center. Tucked below one of the popular landmarks, this restaurant portrays itself as a roadside Dhaba, but yet it radiates an unique charm, class and elegance!

The interior is beautifully decorated with quotations framed and hanging on to the wall. This restaurant practices a policy of open kitchen so that one can see what goes on inside.¬†

Now coming to the food, while it may be termed as something flavorful, it is not exactly mindblowing. I have dined here only once and taken Chicken Tikka Kebabs. The Kebabs were hard and not properly marinated. For take-away's I have ordered here multiple number of times.

While their response time is pretty good but the food they prepare do not justify the same. The Keema Nuns these guys make are often without any flavor. The gravy of Chicken Tikka Masala was unnecessarily spiced to the core. The only thing which I had probably liked here is the Papad they serve and Tandoori Aloo.

The prices here are steep high, as in the quality do not speak for the prices they charge. I hope they do give sufficient attention and care on the food part as I have seen many foodies here in Zomato complaining regarding the same.

Ambiance is outstanding, some the quotes which are written in punjabi are nice. 
Chicken tandoori is just super awesome, tasty, yummy and overall food is good. One suggestion for that restaurant is just increase your floor area and keep a khat system to have food there. :D it will be like an enhancer to the ambiance :)

Dropped in with my family for a special Sunday Lunch. Its located in the City Center Salt Lake area. The place has both indoor & outdoor sitting arrangements but not very spacious. The interior is decorated with photoframes of Punjabi stars like Yuvraj Singh, Kapil Dev, Mika Singh, Jokes on sardars, etc. They have a glass covered open kitchen. We had ordered Tandoori Chicken (Full) which tasted great, Roti was fine, Dal Makhani which was spicy type but okay and Chicken Rara Curry was tasty and spicy. In desserts we had Firni and Kulfi which tasted okay. The staffs are good. Overall nice experience.

I am going to write a review for the vegetarians here. There were 3 of us. we ordered for butter naans and kaabuli naans. This was complemented with sumptuous amount of daal makhani, shahi paneer, chana masala and mushroom matar ending with papad and some extra fresh lime soda.

Ambiance: 4/5
Food: nothing extraordinary.  3/5
Service: 3/5
Pocket pinch: 1200 for 3 people

You will get the best Punjabi cuisine here in Kolkata! Loved the biryani, parathas, mutton korma, chicken tikka. Location is a plus point for sure and the sitting area is a lil clumsy but the interiors are welcoming! Esp the ceiling!!

Veg Menu :- Paneer Kadai and Malai Kofta, with yummy buttery Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan and Tandoori Rotis for the ultimate fill. Billed around 650+, with gr8 Punjabi da Rocks!!! setup..... IMHO what more can you ask. Furnitures may not be top notch but u will let that pass.... Thanks BBD for the sumptuous dinner served (Though I paid for it and you guys topped that with a nicer experience - Beat that!!! ) 

Recommended friends, try it!!!

I loved the pure dhaba experience at balle balle in the midst of the city. Covered in Bollywood posters from top to toe and Bollywood music accompanying it all contributed to the dhaba feel. It attracts a lot of crowd and definitely the seating area is not big enough. Therefore it is a bit congested. But service was swift and the food was beyond fingerlicking good. Chicken Lababdar and Masala Kulcha is something I am going to go back to at Balle Balle!

Bollywood is here! The ambience is just great and it's eye-catching. We had to wait for half an hour which was due to the peak hour. But the food quality and preparation simply great. We had paneer tikka,mushroom matar masala,dal makhni,garlic naan,tandoori roti and kulfi. All were superb and met our expectations.

This is one of the most famous late night eat out place in salt lake sector 1 area. I simply loved their keema kulcha,& finger licking rich and creamy butter chicken.Their Badam kesar kulfi looks so tempting and delicious
Overall I would definitely recommend this punjabbi Dhaba to the authentic north Indian food lovers.They provide both quality and quantity at a very reasonable price.

The ambience is really good. The walls are full of Punjabi Bollywood actors. The starters are really good. Especially chicken Tikka kabab. For main course we had ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, chicken bharta and chicken reshmi Masala. The Bharta was a bit spicy and the other two were sweet. You can even try out Masala cold drink and Lassi. Overall a good place.

over all its a once a place, althought the ambience and the location are quite good.

I fell in love with Balle Balle Dhaba at first 'bite' :D 
Their chicken tandoori is mesmerizing. Tender, luscious and spicy. So are the chicken kebabs. But the fish tikka amritsari pretty much sucked. Also, I found the mutton boti kebab to be amazing but on one occasion, it was too chewy. So it's better to stick to the chicken tandoori and chicken kebabs. Again, some of the reviews said that the biriyani is not that great, but trust me, the biriyani is perfect. The garlic naan tasted great too when I had it, but it left a bit too garlicky aftertaste so wouldn't recommend it. The lassi tasted just right. Also the desserts particularly the firni and the kulfi deserve special mention. 
Another thing that I love about Balle Balle Dhaba is the ambience of this place- the cheerful warmly done up interior, the wooden benches to sit on, the posters of various Punjabi movies and personalities and catchphrases on the walls as well as the ceiling, the hanging lanterns and the Bollywood music playing in the background- everything exudes a very quirky, Punjabi vibe which I love. There's also a seating arrangement outside but it's not quite well maintained, it used to be pretty clean when I had first visited. Also the waiters are a little laid back and don't come to take your order unless you call them and ask them to. This issue needs to be looked upon. But I'd still give this place a 4 because of their amazing food and ambience.

Full on bollywood! Every where there are bolly movie poster which I found fun. The sitting arrangements are a little messy I found but that may be because of the smaller area.
I went there thrice..n I tried tangri every time..not because I luv chic tangri but they make delicious tangri though I didn't like their biryani much so one point gone :(
Still it is a good place & very pocket friendly so one can easily treat during last wk of the month.

When all that was served as per the menu was chicken and alike , plus post Bishorjan / visarjan - had a huge appetite to kill With the Bro - so a 1am pick up and spread and dinner out of the classics - Daal Makhani , Egg-do piaza with tandoori rotis (thing is they definitely were parathas - but oh well!) Never do I rarely ever do dinners after 11 (max) but this was an exception so Worth it! 
The egg - capsicum and onion rich oily but tasteful gravy though on the light side only 
The DAL MAKHANI - exceptionally amazing! Had a few bites of channa in it too (:/) but the spicy tinge and the classic flavour - perfect!! 
Al I could keep commenting - Awesome!! So glad I did it!

I went there during durga puja and trust me or not it was my worst experience. i used to go in d dhaba when i worked at salt lake area; i was very fond of this place,but during festivals don't go there please. their all cutlury,dishes,spoons,even water in the glasses were very unhealthy. Food was ok type,though we didn't take any punjabi special. chicken  biriyani, keema nun, tandoor items,mutton rogan juice were tasty as usual. But my over all experience is so bad that i couldn't comfortably eat anything. please increase ur service boys during festive season.

It's a good combination of Classic dhaba and Morden comfort food Restaurant. The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere,and the waiters make it more comfortable for the customers. And the main thing, the food is totally awesome, you can taste the flavours of Punjab.    But the sitting capacity is to low , they can handle only 50 customers at a time , and it also little bit congested. But according to me it still one of the best Panjabi restaurant at Kolkata.üëçüëç

A go-to restaurant for people on a tight budget, it is beautifully located just ahead of the city centre. Always buzzing with people and quite hard to get a table, when you finally manage to squeeze yourself into one trust me it's worth it.
The food tastes very VERY good and the quantity is also surprisingly sufficient and in the same wavelength as the price. The waiters are all-right, if nothing to write home about. The decor is very well-lit and has a lot of creative touches to it and the background music adds to the more dhaba and punjabi feeling.
All in all, a truly madly 'Balle Balle' experience.
Food-4/5.
Ambiance-4/5.
Location-4/5.
Staff-3.5/5.
Value for money-4/5.

Went in this brightly decorated restaurant which gave me an outright feel of Punjab di shaan - dhaaba. Had Chicken tandoori in starters and butter nun with chicken butter masala, reshmi chicken & mutton rowan juice in the main course. The food quality was amazingly good. But unfortunately missed a glass of Lassi as it was out of stock. Coming to the surroundings & ambience of this place, the interior walls are full of frames carrying different posters of Bollywood films based on Punjab & eminent Punjabi persons. Right from Son of Sardaar to Rang de Basanti, Navjot Singh Siddhu to Vijender Singh, the posters portrays how proud the Punjabi's are about them. And before I forget, a frame also carried poster of the back of a truck, written "Awaaz Do" #quirky.

Had a sudden craving for chicken bharta..thus decided to pay a visit to balle balle dhaba. Located just beside city centre 1 this place serves delicious North Indian food. The interior is really something! The walls are crowded with photos everything punjabi and sardars. From kapil dev to yo yo honey singh..they have it all! And you won't miss the santa banta jokes too. The menu here does not have a lot of options but they have a pretty good variety. Ordered for chicken bharta, mutton rara punjabi and lachha parathas. Each dish tasted divine. The bharta was creamy and super tasty. The mutton pieces were soft and tender and tasted so royal. Lachha paratha was soft. The quantities served was more than enough for two. And all of this for 745 bucks including taxes.

I happened to visit this place by luck. I was with my family and we saw an overcrowded place and just then had decided to explore more on it
The interior of this place will take you back to 1960s . The images of brave patriots are all over. Just not that, even few renowned bollywood actors and their scenes are typically well portrayed on its wall. Brilliant is the word.
We ordered butter nan, garlic naan, rumali roti, dal mahani, and few other varities of side dish.Apologies for my tainted memeory.It turned out to be delicious. Authentic punjabi khana!!. No punjabi dhaba is good if its dal makhani is not great. This restaurant served one of its typical punjabi style uber delicious, mouth watering, downright tempting Dal Makhani. With its utter brilliance of the quality and taste, this restaurant indeed is one of the best in city.
#P.S Get your punjabi side out and savour the authentic punjabi food as much as you can, ,cause you may not get lucky again to savour this kind of food at Kolkata.

It was perfect. During Pujo days to find food which tastes as amazing as the price is a mission. But, Balle Balle Dhaba did it ! 
It gave us amazing food, and left us with a happy heart and stomach at 11-30pm. 

Location - Beside Bata City Centre. 
Parking- you could park it inside CC or on the opposite lane. 

Ambience- It is a AC dhaba, with a few non AC seats outside. Nice art on the wall. Though seats are a bit too close to each other. 

Food - Amazing. 
Fish Tikka- perfect amount of spices. 
Naan- the plain naan was the best thing. 
Biriyani- Great pieces of mutton and aloo. The flavour was adequate. 
Chicken Labadar- a bit spicy red gravy, but good. 
Tarka Daal - perfectly cooked. Not too rich. 
Phirnee- a disappointment. 
Kulfi - good, but nothing extraordinary. 

Service - Decent and very prompt. 

Pocket Pinch- Definitely Value for money !!

Would I come back again- YES!!
What will I try - The Plain Naan and a few other side dishes.

The decor is great with all the funny jokes and Punjabi posters all over the walls.

The place is cramped. Your elbow will hit the person sitting next to your table. Our tandoori roti took 10 minutes to come... finger bowl was put on our table before the dinner was finished.

The first thing one will notice after entering this food junction is d interior decor. This place is inspired by the Punjabi movies and personalities. All the blinging Singh are portrait and framed.
The second thing one will notice is the open kitchen n mouth watering kebabs n tandoor hanging.
One cant point out any flaws in the food. The quality n quantity both are good. 
We visited this place during durga puja when maximum restros drop their quality.
But this place was exceptional.
We ordered tandoori chicken,pahari chicken,butter naan,tandoori naan,keema naan,chicken bharta,chicken tikka masala,dal makhani,plain rice,sweet lime,lassi n firni.
Each and every item taste awesome. The gravies were thick n smooth. The firni was tasty and to me it was better than Arsalan or Shiraz.
I and my gang enjoyed here both the ambience and food.
Will love to visit here again.

Located near City Centre 1. North Indian food lovers must visit this place. Ambiance is good. Great management. You can sit outside while waiting for your table.¬†
They have decorated the inner walls as well as ceilings with popular Punjabi movie posters, players' photos etc. Their service is super quick also during festive seasons.
We tried Masala Kulcha, Mutton Shahi Korma, Shahi Panner, Mutton Biriyani and Rayta. Masala Kulcha was awesome. It was puffy, soft and they served it hot with melting butter on top. Mutton preparations tasted good. Only the mutton pieces were a little hard.
Will try other items as they have many more to serve. Over all, loved this place.

** Ambiance = One would love the superb decorations inside this place, with Punjabi style quotes,jokes and movie pics in the walls ; also the open kitchen with the sheeks hanging :D

**Things tried = Butter Nun, Chicken Bharta, Vegetable polau, Dahi raita, Masala Kulcha and Malai Kofta.

The Chicken bharta was lovely and I savoured each and every moment with it. I had some vegetarian friends with me who tried the vegetable dishes and all of them were tasty and freshly served :) The korma was delicious and had a nice stuffing inside !!

We also tried their Kulfi at the end .

**Recommended = Chicken bharta and Butter Nun. Also one can go for the biriyanis they serve, I have heard they are yummy as well.

**Service = Pretty quick and helpful. Our server helped us a lot with our dish selections, full marks to them.

**Purse Check = Our Bill for 4 people came around Rs.1200/- inclusive of taxes.
I would say Rs.800-900/- for two would be enough.

**Overall = Definitely going back for more of their Mutton Rogan Gosht and Chicken Rara Punjabi.

Cheers!

The name may sound Punjabi but they serve all type of cuisines.. Biriyani was good, the quantity appropriate... And so was the tandoor... The decor is nice depicting the Punjabis in various fields..

Visited this Punjabi themed restaurant located very near to City center 1. The walls and the ceiling are filled with different varieties of posters of sardar jis jokes and memes. . The restaurant was full packed. People were too loud. There was a constant clutter in the ambiance. Sitting arrangements are quite poor. We ordered¬† Chicken biriyani, Mutton Rogan Josh and Keema naan, Mixed veg , plain basmati rice.¬† The biriyani could have been better . Mixed Vegetable was okaish. The keema naan¬† was tasty. And the Mutton Rogan Josh was the show stealer. :) Prices are slightly a bit on the higher side.
¬†But the service was very slow. Overall good north Indian food. :)

Small Dhaba Place, more of a North Indian restaurant. Good food, little less with the quantity in starters, main course is fine. Rotis were soft and smooth(butter). Can manage the crowd better.

Also a dhaba traditionally shouldn't serve Biryani but this one does.

Balle balle dhaba is a nice little joint where you can have good food for a decent price in a dhaba themed interior. I have been to this place a couple of times and i have really enjoyed the food there especially the butter chicken. They don't have a huge menu and the choices are kind of limited but i'm happy to have less choices but good food rather than looking at huge & confusing menu with fancy names for dishes which actually turn out to be chicken dipped in tomato puree.
Now coming back to the point. The food is good and the it doesn't cost you a bomb. Restaurant staff is ok and there is scope for improvement.

This place is located on the lane next to city center 1, when one moves towards p&t quarters keeping bhikharam to their left side. The restaurant is prominently visible, and the colorful lighting outside makes it hard to miss . There are seats outside the restaurant as well , where they serve food if you are willing to skip the a.c. ! But the ambience inside is awesome , so I'd suggest you don't miss that ! The place looks like a mini Punjab heritage museum that serves food in the heart of salt lake . The walls and even the ceilings are choc-a-block with posters of Punjabi luminaries from the world of cricket , Bollywood , music etc. The music is soft Bollywood ,and their kitchen is visible at the back side to all who are waiting for their food . The food here deserves special mention as it tastes great and authentic, and the quantity for 1 plate of any chicken or mutton dish is enough to feed 3 adults . The service was quick . The mutton rara Punjabi tasted good , with lots onions and spice . The butter chicken was heavenly , with visible butter on top, and the garlic naan tasted great with it . The masala kulcha was interesting , and more like a variation of the aloo parantha one usually has . The butter naan was ordinary , but big enough to feed two people . If you're craving north Indian spicyness , think not twice before walking into this Punjabi carnival !

Its a nice place to satisfy your tummy situated just outside cc1. We were here for a friend's birthday treat and we were 9 people.For starters we ordered chicken reshmi kabab.It was nice but the kabab could have been a little more soft.In the main course we took chicken lababdar,mutton biriyani and butter naan.Chicken lababdar was fantastic and the naan was okay.Mutton biritani was really tasty and specially the mutton pieces were really softand tasted very good.This place will also not burn a hole in your pocket!

Visited this place on Saturday night with my family for some good wholesome Punjabi Food and was not disappointed. Ordered Tandoori chicken which was properly grilled. Then followed up with Keema matar and mutton Tarka with Roti and Kashmiri Pulao which were equally tasty. Finally, the kulpi was really good and left a satisfied feeling. I feel this is the best place for authentic North Indian food in the city centre area.

The only thing that prevents me from awarding a higher score is the lack of onions, chillies and achar, which are normally provided without been asked for.

The interior is a bit cramped but it does detracts you from the good food served.

I was avoiding this place from a long time, beleiving it to be some off shoot of the typical azad hind dhabas or rang de basantis of the world. However I was pleasantly taken by surprise when I walked in with some of my friends few months back. The food over here tastes good, the typical punjabi style north Indian flavour can be distinctly felt. Starters like Tangri Kebab and Prawns Tandoori are a must have. The quint essential dhaba dish butter chicken is again a must have, though I would suggest chicken lababdar and rara as well... Biryani is ok, nthng gr88 but quite fine.. Lesser than the likes of Arsalan nd Royal in terms of taste, but better than most other joints in salt lake.. The only problem I found was the lack of space inside as well as parking slots.. All in all its good to give a try..

Once there was a boy. The boy grew up in delhi and he was surrounded by punjabi food. And he was glad. He was happy. Then, he moved to Kolkata, the land of good food but a part of him was sad. He missed that taste and that feel of familiar tadkay waali punjabi cuisine. One day he discovered a place hidden in plain sight. The balle balle dhaba. Some hard hitting shameful facts to some stereotypical jokes to some hindi film posters don the walls. The boy took time out to read them because each one reminded him of delhi. He then started ordering. The smell of the foods was enough to make his stomach rumble in hunger grumble in anticipation. Would a proper starter main course dessert be right or just his second greatest love affair with butter chicken be requited. He was in a gastronomic dilemma. To eat or to eat a lot was the question. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted his childhood crush, lasuni kebab. A flood of memories and a wave of nostalgia hit him as he remembered those nights when he indulged in his sinful threesomes of butter naan butter chicken and lasuni kebab. As, the walrus said, "the time has come to talk of many things" so indeed it had and talk we will but after we eat is what the boy decided. The eternal love affair that had long ago been forgotten was rekindled. Those flames of timorous desire had again been fanned and this was how the boy and balle balle dhaaba lived happily ever after.

Ambience was awesome. Decoration was amazing. Food rates were high, taste wasn't that good. The naans served to us were burnt and when we questioned the waiter he said that this is the way of the naan being cooked. Onion salad provided when orderedbut was not worth the price as there were only 6 slices of onions on th plate. Vegetarians should probably ignore going here. My visit here disappointed me.

Coming to food. Biriyani is quite satisfactory. No complaints. Chicken lababdar it seems is a hit and after having that felt the sameway. It was just great. Awesome was the garlic nan. 
Food was just rightly spiced and light, so great news for foodies there. 
Definite visit for north indian food lovers and the fact its open till 2am in salt lake area is another plus.

I visited the place recently. I tried out mutton biriyani and chicken lababdar (on recommendation of my colleague) and both the dishes were delicious to say the least. The service is fast and the price is also justifiable given the quality of the food. The only con which i noticed was space congestion. Avoid the place if you suffer from claustrophobia, else its definitely worth a try.

Went today to dinner... The interiors are not great, chairs very uncomfortable, Aircon was also nit working properly... To top all such dismal ambience the washroom was dirty and stinking. Coming to the service, it was slow but still ok.. Now the food part, we ordered only vegetarian food. The tandoori aloo was half burnt and was served on the plate in such a way that the burnt part was not visible... Quite a trick by them but asked them to replace it. However, the taste was not good. Ordered fresh lime sweet but they served a salty one. Main course was descent but beads pathetic... I did ask them if tandoori roti was made from atta to which they said yes but it was not the case... Felt misguided. Overall not a good dining experience.

This is the 1st restaurant i tried in Kolkata. The name is enough to excite any north Indian. The interior, true to the name, has photos of famous sardars and punjabis. Music was soothing. There is also outside siting arrangement. We ordered the regular malai kofta and dal makhni with tandoori rotis. Food was good. But the veg variety is very limited. All in all it was a satisfactory experience.

The food was just about ok. Mutton boti kebab had too much salt in it which actually affected the taste. Fish tikka Amritsari was pretty decent with the Fish appropriately boiled and grilled to perfection. Chicken Reshmi tikka had all the spices in it but the taste was not that palatable. Methi Mattar Malai tasted pretty good in veg dishes.  I really expected more out of this dhaba, but alas it couldn't make up to my expectations!

Located in the posh area of City center 1,salt lake, this is what you call a "Fultu Punjabi styled and themed dhaba-restaurant". The walls are adorrned by the posters and pictures of the great "Sons of Sardars" who have served the country proudly.

As far as food is concerned, Punjabi cuisine should be the first choice. However the Biriyani is also good.

Loved the experience.

First of all top marks for the Dhaba decor and ambience,  went well with the music played!
Now food.  Really quite delicious and appropriately priced.  
We had mutton biriyani,  few butter naans and had Chciken lababdar for sides. Had a rich taste, spicy but very good. 
Biriyani was amongst the best of ones I hav had in kolkata.  To be honest this restro really surprised me.

"Balle Balle Dhaba" - the name says it all - located jus behind CC1 (CITY CENTRE-SALTLAKE), d decor - d theme - d ambience - cuts offf 2 show us the purity from punjab - but in a trendy way..  & not in a typical ethnic way - wch actualy attracted me. while entering i ws a bit unsure abt the food they serve...as its not necessary tht evry new resto v get in....cums out 2 be good.
BUT ...
this place actualy made me fall for its yumm food. v ordered - chicken bharta, kashmiri aloo dum, dal makhni, peas pulao, tandoori rotis & onion salad. Not even a single dish dissapointed me. all of them wre absolutely fresh, creamy, less oily, good quantity(for two), & fab in taste. i loved being there & wish to visit there again *soon* ! :)

Visited this 'punjabi' themed restaurant today with a friend. The restaurant has a very interesting ambience. The walls and the ceiling are filled with different varieties of posters of punjabi origin. Though they had wooden tables,the chairs of were steel. That is probably done to add to the dhaba atmosphere. The restaurant was full packed. We ordered Chicken Pahari Kebab, Chicken biriyani, Mutton Rogan Josh and Keema naan. The kebab was spicy and very delicious. The biriyani could have been better but the potato in it was VERY tasty. The keema naan had sufficient keema and butter and was tasty. The Mutton Rogan Josh was the show stealer. :)
The staff were polite and helped us while ordering. But the service was a bit low,maybe because of the rush. Nevertheless had a pleasant experience at Balle Balle Dhaba! :D

Balle balle was jam packed on a Sunday afternoon. What stands out immediately is the fun interiors, full of sardar references crossed with a wine and pizza place sort of decor. Confusing but fun. The food was pretty good. The classic aloo dum was nicely done, super tangy and spicy. There was something amiss in the dal makhni, maybe malai/makhan? The veg pulao was par for the course. Overall a totally decent though unmemorable meal.

Went there last Saturday for late night dinner ..... limited parking space for 4wheeler outside¬† ..... 2wheelers can be parked in an even smaller area just beside the restuarant in the section where the rickshaws are parked ......
Regarding ambience, opinions are mixed as far as i am concerned ...... the good part is the theme they have tried to maintain inside which is of a good roadside dhaba generally found on a highway specially for punjabi food ..... the walls(side walls as well as the top) are filled with posters from several bollywood movies specially of Sardars ...e.g singh is king, son of sardar, bhagat singh, milkha singh ,etc ......... well the downside is its a bit clumsy and congested inside and could have been kept more clean .... the washroom is quite dirty .....!!
Regarding the food , quality is quite good i should say though not one of the best .... i,e they might not have any signature dish of their own (like mutton hanglabari in hanglatherium, or jhupu pishis mutton in santa's fantasea or raan singh saheb in punj-aab,etc)¬† but u wont find their preparations lacking taste ....... We ordered biriyani which was good ...... chicken rara punjabi and chicken curry not bad ..... Fish Tikka Amritsari was ok too ,as was firni .......
Prices are slightly a bit on the higher side i should say (considering the overall customer experience in terms of food ,ambience etc) , but its location in close proximity to cc1 is a reason for being so .......
Its main USP is that it remains open after midnight till 2pm at night , so when u dont have options at late night , this is certainly your saviour for the night :)

This review of mine is based on my last three visits to the joint. The service is good. The food is satisfactory except for the breads that were burnt from the back each time I ordered. The non vegetarian as well as vegetarian snacks are good. Interiors are very attractive. 

I would just warn my followers about the breads. Apart from this, a good place to visit occasionally.

Went there for dinner on a Sunday. We had to wait for 10 minutes to enter the restaurant since there was a huge rush, but the wait was totally worth it. We ordered Tandoori chicken, Chicken pahari kabab, dal makhani, chicken bharta, butter nan, masala kulcha, masala thumbs up and masala papad. The service was quick and the food was heavenly! The ambience was cosy and the decor was very interesting and refreshing.
Overall
Food-5/5
Service-4/5
Decor-4.5/5
PRICES-4.5/5(pretty reasonable)
Ambience-3.5/5(since the seating arrangement was a bit too cluttered, a bit more spaced out tables would have made it less chaotic)

TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Great Place. Awesome Food. I have not tasted such authentic food for a very long time. Service was very good and fast and they were very nice and helped choose the food. Also met the person who own the place. Very Modest and Humble and explained me about the food he ordered. Its a good sign when the person who owns the restaurant eats there. He invited me again to explain all other food he was offering.

Ordered¬†
Biryani. It was very very Tasty with so much flavors. Highly recommend this
Butter Roti: this is not Naan but a different version of Roti and its very good too
Curry /Kaasa: the spices were so great in this dish and it tasted out of the world.

Would recommend this place to folks I know and I will be there whenever I am in Calcutta

Been to this place twice in a week because I liked it so much. The ambience is good, loved the outdoor seating in this chilly weather. However the decor isn't typically Punjabi..like the name. The food, is value for money and very good. Had the butter naan, egg tarka, chicken rana Punjabi and mushroom tawa masala... All were really good. Looking forward to my next visit to try out the biriyani :)

Food quality is good- I liked dal makhani and sahi paneer a lot - the restaurant is small and there is a waiting on weekends - parking is a problem - pricing is on the higher side - the interior is covered with posters of famous celebrities from Punjab - it can be more appealing to the non vegeterians

A small place which gives a view of mini Punjab filled with Sardar posters n all.. Interiors are what makes it attractive from outside.. .. If u prefer spicey and real dhaba food then one must definitely drop a visit here... Service is average.. However,the place stinks a lil and is a lil congested... But the food is no doubt delicious...

Well it says its a dhaba but more over its a restaurant,a congested one...the decor is too clumsy and the ambience not appreciated at all...the waiters are kinda laid back...one needs to call them for the menu and also a glass of water and then on the top they are forgetful.... Like if someone specifies something about a dish etc...the quality of the food was average.. I and a friend of mine was their for our lunch...we ordered tandoori rotis,dal makhani (which was so sweet that it tasted like a dessert)... A full tandoori chicken... And a pahari chicken kebab... The taste of all of them were not at all up to the mark and fresh alike a tasteful dhaba....so...don't hope to visit again... Though the price is allright of the dishes....

visited the restaurant twice. Food quality is moderate with high price compared to other tasty restaurant. very little space inside and very much crowded with lot of noise as tables are very near to each other. Interior decoration is too much clumsy. Not only food even the ambiance is not enjoyable. Though one two odd food was good.So you can try for once but definitely u don't wanna go there again and again.

Very rude staff I come here almost every third or day. Today on sunday I came for lunch and was alone so there was no one to take order as they were majorly busy in big tables as their orders were more important and heavily priced. After 20 mins someone took my order and when I asked for lassi I was refused saying yoday it's not possible staff was rude and careless. If you guys are so busy then don't accept single tables on sundays put a board outside NO SINGLE  TABLES but don't insult some one you are serving food for which I pay not doing any charity for me

Visited a dhaba after a long time with my better half... just for a change... but was disappointed as nothing about the place attracted me not even the food...

Ambience: Well as expected it's a bit loud.. people talking loudly unnecessarily.. mostly those dumb people working in IT firms bragging about their corporate cards which will give them a discount.. and shouting at waiters as if they own the place.. it's simply irritating.. then there's "mera naam mary" item song was being played in a music channel and those so called wannabe IT firm owners were glued to the screen.. 

Decor: it was rather tacky.. pictures of besura honey Singh and mika irritated me... the tables weren't cleaned properly... one can notice the oily surface... so many pictures here and there made the place look more congested...

Service: It's average I would say.. the waiters are slow as well as forgetful.. 10 mins after placing the order we got water after asking them a few times.. even when I asked for green chillis they just forgot .. I had to ask them once again.. they seemed confused about everything..

Food: was also average... we ordered tandoori chicken, chicken pahari kebab, tandoori roti and dal makhani..
The starters were fine but the tandoori roti wasn't that good as it should be.. the dal makhani was very sweet... whereas i've had dal makhani before manytimes in actual dhabas but they never made it so sweet.. somewhere the chatakedaar factor of Punjabi food was missing... 

Some people may disagree with my views but I would say it's not a place for spicy food lovers like me...

Balle Balle Dhaba is very conspicuously located adjacent to City Center - 1 in Salt Lake. The formula of this restaurant is very similar to that of Azad Hind. They serve very conventional north Indian cuisine cooked in the most familiar fashion. There's nothing new or extraordinary in their menu, however their quality is somewhat better than Azad Hind, at least the ones in Salt Lake and Sector V. I have also gone as far as to try their Biryani, which was surprisingly good. The only gripe I have is with their seating arrangement. The place is very poorly designed which makes certain portions of the eating area very claustrophobic. It's not a very pleasurable experience to sit almost intimately close to another table full of people talking out loud on a packed weekend. I do hope they renovate or change the seating arrangement. The open kitchen also doesn't make much sense and seems redundant as the tables and chairs are all arranged in perpendicular to the kitchen, so unless you deliberately try to sneak a glance at the kitchen, you are not really paying attention to it. Service can also be a little disappointing on a busy night. Pricing is not too high. All that made me give them a rather generous 3. It's a cool place to go for a dinner with your buddies and feast on some decent conventional north Indian food.

Ummm...I would say, the ambience was good, had a touch of Punjab. Starting from the pictures of prominent figures of Punjab to the Punjabi songs playing in the backdrop, everything seemed so Punjabi.
About the food, 'twas decent. I loved the malai kofta they served and the chicken rara masala too. The naans with extra butter was delicious too. Above all, I would recommend people to try the lassi they serve. It was absolutely fantastic. 
Overall, I would rate it at 3.5/5.

The most advantageous part of this place its timing. 12 am to 2am. Correct, its 2AM in the early morning. A place to satisfy your late night cravings. Nevertheless, the latest I had been to this Dhaba (as it is  called) at 12.15 and then also the place was brisk. Food is good. Mutton items are somehow better than their chicken counterparts. I have rarely tried fish at this place but yesterday I tried theor special item of whoke Betki (photo attached). It was very good. Ambience is nice amd chick. Decor is heavily Punjabi ;)

Had heard alot about this place being near my office n also food wise.
But had the chance to visit when my team suddenly decided in a lunch together.
The atmosphere of the place is not that of a dhaba as per the name but more of someone being obsessed with Punjab.
The place is small full of all sorts of punjabi film pics, singers pics n everything to do with punjabi.
We were almost 16 heads n they immediately made sitting arrangement for us.
Coming to food the tandoori chicken was very good the chicken itself being fresh.
The kulchas n naans were served hot n fresh.
The chicken bharta tasted not that great having had better one's.
They have good amount of veg options as well.
Even biryani tasted good.
Price wise it's good as well.
Definitely a good option to return for punjabi food cravings.

The food served was actually good and since we don't find too many north Indian restaurants in Salt Lake so this one is pretty crowded at least during lunch hours.. The only negative feedback about this place would be the ambience as the food table looked very dirty otherwise it is a must visit place to have north Indian food..

Not much unlike the punjabi folklore, this place is absolutely bustling with energy and colourfulness. The super sized banner at the entry gates added much to its appeal. The interior walls and ceiling were covered with portraits of Punjabi celebs all the way from Milkha Singh to Rocket Singh. We kept gazing them one at a time while we waited for our order.

We had ordered Tandoori Chicken and Fish Afghani Kabab for starters, both of which were greatly sumptous. The taste was divine; especially Tandoori Chicken was too brilliant as it kept melting in our mouth. This was followed by the main course which comprised of Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Naan and Masala Kulcha. The amount of stuffing in masala kulcha was generous, which contributed to its ambrosial flavour.

We were pretty much stuffed when we suddently recalled the awesome phirni on the menu, concluding our meal.

The service is average, but the waiters are  courteous enough. Prices are a bit over the average mark, as one would expect. But the place definitely called for uniqueness and authenticity.

This is my first visit to Kolkata and the very first dinner out. I am staying near the City center, so just went out for a walk and also in search of a restaurant. The first restaurant we saw was this Balle Balle Dhaba. It was crowded but we were lucky enough to get a place. They don't have much starters but the food was decent. We tried butter naan , tandoori roti and masala kulcha with dal takra and paneer butter masala. The paneer butter masala was so sweet. Dal was good. And the tandoori aloo also good. A decent place for a quick dinner.

I had never thought i would visit this place, even though it was very close to my place because of the sheer crowd. Its always packed at meal times with people lining up outside for a seat. Ultimately we decided to go there on my mom's birthday, one particular reason being that the restaurant remains open till late. So we arrived and were pleasantly surprised to find one table empty. The first thing about the place is that its loud; and its not just the volume of the place - the place is decorated with film posters and everything punjabi. Not an inch of space is left on ths walls and ceiling.
        The seating was not good i must say. I guess they tried to give it too much of a dhaba feel. We ordered for our food and it arrived in a jiffy which was great. Coming to the food the chicken tikka kebab was average. The methi paratha and masala kulcha were perfectly done. The chicken rara punjabi was good but failed to excite. The show stealer was definitely the mixed veg. It was a dry preparation with adequate veggies & spices, and it went perfectly with the methi paratha. We topped it off with firni and kulfi. The firni was sumptuous but the kulfi came without falooda (apparently because they didn't have any)
      All in all a good place if you can handle the volume. Food needs to improve a bit and they need to increase the number of items on the menu. Another plus point is that its open till 2am.

Balle Balle has been one my favorite dinner places for the past few months. I have been here a number of times and never did I have a bad experience.
Pros: Unique ambience,  excellent food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarian lovers, service is polite and quick. 
Cons: It is a small place which is packed almost all the time. 
The restaurant is at City Center 1 which is a very central location in Salt Lake. If you're a foodie looking to fill your stomach with authentic punjabi tandoori chicken and dal makhani this is the place to be.

After a late-night movie @city center on a Friday evening me and my friend thought of having dinner before heading home.. My friend suggested that she had tried Balle Balle Dhaba a no of times and it serves decent food.. So on her suggestions we went in.. 

Luckily we found a quick seat for two.. The interior was quirky with all old Hindi movie posters dominating the wall.. 
We ordered Kabuli Nun, Chicken Bharti, Chicken Tarka and Bundi Raita... 
The staff seemed confused taking too many orders (as it was Friday nyt, the place was crowded),  the order arrived after 15mins.. 
The food was fine.. Chicken Bharta was okish.. But I have tasted better Bharta at cheaper rates.. 
Overall a decent place to have dinner specially if u are planning a late night dinner in or around City Center 1

A cramped up place this is, just outside City Centre I. Walls jam packed with humorous anecdotes in form of pictures, posters or punchlines, all related to Punjab and Punjabis make for a nice decor. Chicken tandoori was an absolute beauty, burnt to achieve the absolute hue, yet juicy and tender inside. The rest of the food was good enough, but nothing to mention in particular.  Yes, this is a place I might visit again.

Went there on a saturday night with my family for dinner.Had to wait roughly for 20mins before we finally got our table..now the restaurant is technically not very big in size but these guys have been able to utilize the space very smartly the interior is quite qirky especially with all those posters.Coming to the food-we ordered the chicken pahari kebab.. butter naan. the classic chicken bharta and chicken lababdar and fresh lime soda to wash it all down.The service was very fast and efficient.The kebabs arrived quite quickly i would say.The chicken pieces were tender properly spiced cooked very nicely.Infact everything we ordered tasted great .the naan the barta..n the chicken labadar. The chicken bharta was excellent something i am going to definitely try the next time.These guys really know how to cook some decent food especially at amazing prices.Out bill was just around the 1k mark.so that was really amazing.Definitely coming back to try the other dishes.

First of all, I just loved the decor of the place. It just exudes Punjab. Would have been much better if there was a lil more space between tables. Coming to the food, I have been here quite a few times now and have liked the food most of the time. I usually order the same old bhartas, tikkas and Naans which I love here. Worth ones time and money I would say.

We went to this Dhaba (which has a very prominent location beside City Centre Salt Lake, opposite Just Baked and the Vasan Eye Care building) at 11.50 p.m. a few days ago, on the way home after a prolonged train journey, and couldn't wait long enough for ghar-ka-khana. This dhaba seemed just right for us ravenous souls. We were in a hurry, so we asked the waiters to serve us very quickly, and they obliged by serving everything in 5-7 minutes! We ordered:
1. Chicken Reshmi Kebab (delicious, accompanying sauce was great);
2. Chicken Tikka Masala (really good too, though it was a little too spicy for me);
3. Garlic Naan (mega-sized, crispy yet soft naans, they were delectable);
4. Firni (this was pretty good too, though I've had better).
The dhaba has a lot of pictures of cricketers, quotations and funny posters. Ambiance is good and the service is great too. I'm definitely visiting again!

The food is really good, their signature dish, the mutyon rara punjabi is a perfecy duet of spice and finally choped coriander and parcely that lets out a unique flavour that combines spunk and serenity in the same mix but not to be a party pooper but the service is slow

A friend of mine has been speaking a lot about this joint, and then an uncle and aunt catered from them for a family get together, and my husband and I liked the food; this along with the convenient location made us plan a trip to it. Decor or seating is nothing outstanding -- but it has a cozy feel. Now coming to the food -- We tried Mutton Adrak ke Panje, Fish Tikka Amritsari, Garlic Naan, Chicken Tarka, Kashmiri, Pulao. We have no complains about the food. At that time we did not know that the phirni is highly recommended, so we skipped dessert -- perhaps the next time.

Balle balle dhaba is a family dhaba...
My ratings for
Location = 4 It a easy to locate near the city centre.
Ambience = 3 very cramped with little space.. buy has a lot of funny pics and qotations
Staff = 3.5. These guys are not very up to the mark guys.. needs more training.
Food = 4.5. The food i guess have improved significantly.
My recommendation would be not to miss Nalli Kabab. Its their speciality and awesome to taste.. its mouth watering too... 
The only advantage is its open late night and you can go there if ur looking for food at odd hours.
Previously i had rated this place a 3.5 but over my last 2 visits late night i have really enjoyes the food and especially nalli kabab whic i mentioned above...
This place is moving in my good books...üòâ

Yesterday, me and my wife visited this dhaba. Decoration was good and we order starter as Chicken tikka kabab which taste good. And in meal we order chicken rara punjabi, chiken kassa , both are not good taste with spices only. And one more thing We order Butter nan and tandoori roti also which was so hard that you cant eat even a single piece. Then we ordered Steamed Basamati rice which is also smelling very bad. Finally , only cost of all items are high rather than taste.

Then came Chicken Lababdar , Chicken Bharta and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala . Just two words - really awesome ! Had them with Butter naan . Tried Paneer Pulao and Kashmiri Pulao . Paneer was better . Then had Kulfi for Dessert which was a bit of an disappointment . Staff services need to be improved . All in all very good and pocket friendly .

The food: Authentic punajbi complete with a glass of lassi to end. Good in a word.
The ambience: Nice for a small joint. The posters shout Punjab (all of the innumerable posters has the Punajb connect).
Pocket pinch: On the higher side, for a normal North Indian joint.
The service: Depressing. The waiters don't serve the dishes unless they are told to. They chatter among themselves and don't respond.

It's actually unbelievable that done one in East India can actually fix a Punjabi Tandoori Chicken and Mutton Seekh kebabs so well that it puts Food joints in Punjab to shame 

Yes it does take a little while to find a table and waiting outside is a real pathetic experience. Do they make up for it with the food flavour? partial yes. 

We sat on the tables out side and it was mad pouring rain. Enjoyed the feeling of little drops of rain running past your skin and couple that with Finger licking good food. 

The Chicken Biryani was also par excellence. 

To sum it up all, go late night after 11 and you lol enjoy the food. Go at peak hour and you ll regret the long wait

Good place to hang out. The environment is quite different here. You will find lots of Punjabi posters including jokes, film banners all over the place even the ceilings. Most interesting part is you can see the cooks while waiting for your order, the kitchen is right in front of you covered by glass. 
Now coming to the food quality. Tried few common mughlai dishes - taste good , good quality materials used thoroughly. Specially tandoori starter items and rooti items are really good.
Service is alright.
Price is pocket friendly.

One thing I have found wrong is the chairs are not much comfortable.

I actually went for some Chinese at Hakka but suddenly my companion had a craving for dhaba food so we decided to give this place a try. I was surprised to see such crowd in the restaurant and ppl waiting outside for their turn but being a Sunday night it was understandable even we had to wait 40 mins to get a table. Now down to business.
Ambience: Its the 1st thing I notice ab any restaurant and it matters a lot to me. The decor was good with all things punjabi n the walls roof everything covered with frames containing pic of punjabi achievers. But the place is too congested and loud so not so impressive.
Food: Very good i must say. We didn't tried many things but all tasted awesome specially the chicken tikka masala.
Service: Was in general ordinary need to improve that.
Price: Very reasonably priced and the food quantity is also a lot.
Overall a thumbs up. Looking forward to coming here again to try the rest of the dishes.

It's located near city center, opposite vasan eye care. You ll be easily spot the place with cars parked outside the entrance. 
Its a small place and they have managed to put quite a few tables. There is also open air sitting available. 
FOOD:
It is nice. Kashmiri Aloo was really good. Dal makhani had something of dhaba feel missing, however it was good. 
Lacha paratha were not at all good. Tandoori roti is better. 
This place is always buzzing with ppl, so be prepared to wait b4 you get the seat. 

P.S. : no onion salad is served complimentary!!!

The restaurant is open till 1am so thats an added advantage.
Though not a huge place(it might get too noisy) the decor is excellent with movie posters and other nick nacks.
There is an open air sitting arrangement also which is great.
I personally prefered sitting outside.

I have been a fan of Punjabi food since one of my close friend made chicken kebab. I have visited many restaurants, well known for their Punjabi cuisines. Having a proper Punjabi delicacy in Kolkata , where fish is the main item in non-veg, is not a easy. Though there are many a restaurants serving ¬†Punjabi cuisines, but I found my true love for Punjabi food here. I visited this place a few weeks ago, and I was spell bound by its chicken tandoori kebab. i went with ¬†quite a few friends and had to wait almost an hour to get a sit, as it was a rush hour. The sudden plan to have change of our taste buds, ended quite well. We ordered quite a few plates of chicken biryani, mutton shahi korma. They were quite good. Then we ordered chicken tandoori kebab and some tandoori prawns. I liked chicken tandoori very much and left very less for my fellows..:) My friends liked tandoori prawns quite a lot. Overall, it is a good hangout place and we had a nice reunion of our gang.

Best part about the restaurant: It's open till way late in the night and provides a wonderful option for late night food lovers to hop on if hungry. Food tastes good if not earth-shattering great. Mutton delicacies are really nice. They have got a good decor in the place. The staff needs some training though as the service levels need improvement. They generally attend to a customer after being called 2-3 times, takes time to clean away dirty tables when the customer is sitting there for 10 minutes.

Visited the place around 11 pm after a movie at city centre. Nice ambience with a small open air area, air conditioned interiors and show kitchen. Seats are a bit hard for my liking.

We ordered a special seek kabab which had khoya stuffed in it and while the mutton mince was good, the sweet khoya didn't go well with the spicy mutton. The dal amritsari was a curious mish mash, without feeling the lentils, all we felt was mashed pulses. The egg bhurjee was good with right amount of spices and tomato and the keema naan was also above average.

All in all, a place which tries hard but falls between presenting itself as a restaurant and a dhaba.

One more new restaurant that we explored recently is Balle Balle dhaba, Salt lake sector 1 brunch. This place located just beside the city center, just behind the bata shop.

This restaurant has quirky decor, ample space with a sitting arrengement for nearly 60 persons (as per my count). They also have a outdoor sitting arrengement for a few. But we prefered the air-conditioned indoor. the wall and cilling are fool of photos, posters, movie stills and quotetion that gives you a essence of punjub. But what is most annoying is that they have two televisions facing each other at the opposite walls, both plays different different channels and their sound mixes badly in the room and except that they plays another different music system separately (may be for out door sitting), and it's sound too comes inside the restaurant. So, you can imagine that, the place is a bit noisy. 

They have their kitchen behind a transparent glass wall. Overall here you can experience a casual dinning feeling. Waiting time for the food is medium, but not too long. Stuffs are helpful, though not prompt enough.

Coming to the food, we ordered Kabuli Naan, Chicken tikka kebab, Chicken reshmi masala, sweet Lassi and green salad.

Chicken tikka kebab - It consists of six pieces of kebabs, made of soft marinated chicken having nice tikha-khatta balanced flavour, but felt it was a little dry inside (Not perfect but good). Comes with a spicy green cilli-pudina chutney and onions, which you'll surely like.

Kabuli Naan - it was thin paratha like (was not looking like a naan actually) and crushed cashews,fennel and grains of sugar was spread all over. Taste was good but it became very stiff in a few seconds after serving and lastly became more or less like a papad.

Chicken reshmi masala - This was the most delicious dish we have eaten here. Very soft, buttery smooth chicken reshmi tikkas in more buttery gravy. The gravy had perfect portion of salt, sugar and other spices, you can taste the thick rich paste of cashew nut and butter in it and forgive the crunchiness of the naan. Yes, i did it too!

Sweet lassi - The Lassi was very average, couldn't find the Punjub ka lassi specialty.

Their biriyani and butter naan are also famous. I would like to try their other items, during my next visit here. Surely you can check it out.

Went there tonight. Plan was suddenly made and since its near so we decided visit this place for the 1st time. Waited outside for 30min even on friday so initially we thought quality must be very good for 30min waiting time. Went inside and stood infront of table for another 10min so someone could clean the table!!! Had to call someone to clean it at the end. Place is totally clumsy, not maintained at all. Even road side dhabas are far better and clean and maintained nowadays. Food quality was good. Wonder how this place is surviving having this standard in saltlake area where there are many more options with better service. Only thing good here was food quality but quantity was not good. I dont recommend this place if someone plans to take family, its only good for hanging with friends on a roadside food junction.

Balle balle to awesome North Indian food. Situated just at the corner of city center , salt lake sector -1. The place looks really big from outside but in reality it isn't so. Very cramped sitting area with a glass open kitchen which is a good thing as u can see how ur food is getting prepared. Visited the place on a Friday afternoon and the place was full , when we got the table the waiter took our order promptly and got us the drinks and starters quickly. 
When the food arrived it was hot and very tasty, not very spicy or oily. The matar pulao was made in butter and it was extremely tasty and the kebabs where also really great. 
One should try it out for sure sometime.

'Balle Balle Dhaba' is located just beside the Salt Lake City Centre,opposite of Vasan Eye care.Today I went here with my friends for dinner.Ambience is attractive,lots of stars photo (Ex-Manmohan Singh,Sunny Deol,Yuvraj Singh,Harbhajan Singh,Daler Mehndi etc) are hanging on the wall.Atfirst we ordered one full plate Tandoori chicken & one plate Chicken Tikka Kebab with Masala Cold Drinks,Fresh Lime Soda & Cold Drinks.Chicken Tikka Kebab is just outstanding,this is very soft & melt in our mouth.This is 6 pcs chicken & fully mixed with delicious masala.Must try it.Tandoori Chicken is also very delicious.I lick my finger at the end of chicken.Then we ordered another plate of Chicken Tikka Kebab.In the main course we ordered Chicken Rara Punjabi,Mutton Rogan josh,6 pcs Tandoori Rooti,one plate Jeera Rice,one masala kulcha.Chicken Rara Punjabi is unique taste,it is cooked with keema.I just enjoyed Chicken Rara Punjabi with jeera rice.this is amazing tasty.Mutton Rogan josh is also tasty.Atlast we ordered kulfi & firni as a dessert.Both are very tasty.we enjoy their all foods.Food service is little late.Price is reasonable.worth a visit.

I have been to Balle Balle Dhaba just once and I remember I was in a bit of a hurry. 
The face of a cute Sardar and the bold colourful letters with which read "Balle Balle Dhaba" catches both your eye and attention instantly. 
What I loved about this place is obviously the location and the decor. Just situated right next to city centre 1 exit, it's very easy to spot and the interiors have interesting posters of movies! The seating arrangement is quite impressive even though the place is not that spacious. 
We ordered the usual chicken tandoori, mushroom masala, chicken bharta and butter nun, quantity wise really good but as far as the taste is concerned they have to lot of scope for improvement. 
Just newly opened some months back, this place even has an outdoor seating & I am sure by now it has become quite popular. 
Since this was my first visit I would really want to give them the benefit of doubt and visit here again to see whether this can be my next favourite dhaba because honestly I love North Indian cuisine and can't get enough of it.

One of the worst places. I went for lunch with my family there and its quite surprising to see the laziness of the service even at 12PM. I for one didn't like the space, too crampy and also the seating was not comfortable. Food was utter rubbish with a lot of chilly flakes in all non veg items. Service also poor as they brought the wrong food items. Won't go again.

I thought the lassi served by a restaurant going by the name "Balle Balle" would be good... But it was by far the worst lassi I have ever had! The table was dirty even after having asked for it to be cleaned! The food was ordinary except for the jhal frezi, which was quite good. Service was pathetic and we had to holler for the waiter every time we needed something... I would not recommend driving across the city for such a mundane dining experience.

Mutton rara punjabi
Chicken lababdar

The best keema naan I ever had....its just too good...a must try.
So is the biriyani....the rice just melts in ur mouth....flavour is perfect.
I have been here twice...and both times they just nailed it....
Keep up the good work guys.

Having born and bred in the North of the Country and having a taste of that specific Northern Curries and breads.. I couldn't actually find anything quite like my home cuisine in Calcutta even after trying a hell lot of North Indian restaurants. But when I finally landed here.. I could actually make out that the chef is not a local and does justice to the North Indian Cuisine in the land of Bengal. Yes, infact.. If you crave for the actual North Indian dishes of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi and haven't found a place to fulfill them.. This is one place where you must come!

Awesome food, great service. Went there worth a couple of friends. The interiors reflect the color of Punjab. With pictures on all walls and even on roof,  the impression is hard to miss. Space is limited, you may have to elbow your neighbors a bit,  but the  Punjabis really don't mind! Parking is an issue, but 4 vehicles can be adjusted in the front. Coming to the food, it's a real treat. Masala Kulcha, pahari kebab, mushroom mutter etc very really good. I thought the non vegetarian dishes looked more appetizing, no offence. Firni was likable. Looking forward to another outing soon..

Dhabas all the way. This Dhaba located in Sector 1 is a delight. The interiors are truly inspired by the Punjabi Tint. The only thing is that the seating is a bit awkward. The food was fabulous, it was economical. Good quantities. Good rotis. It has everything a Dhaba should have. A must visit!

An excellent place, if you want to have some delicious Panjabi food.
The Pros-
1. Extremely tasty food.
2. An appealing Panjabi ambience.
3. Quite and efficient service.
The Cons-
1. A bit pricy for the middle-class but not unreasonable.
2. Can be clumsy during rush hours due to limited space.

We ordered Chicken Rara Punjabi, Mutton Roganjosh and Yellow Dal Amritsari with Tandoori roti. Each and every dish was delicious. Esp., Yellow Dal Amritsari, it's a must try! ?

How to reach? - It is located just behind the City Centre Mall 1

My Personal Rating is as follow
Food Quality: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Location: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5
For this place only the service¬†and ambience is impressive. This restaurant right from the name indicates that
it belongs to Punjabi theme, but the food quality does not meet to the expectation.
As per the food, it‚Äôs little bit expensive. The best thing to get there is just
for its location (behind the CC1) and the late night serving.

Well I had read too good reviews about this place and was really awaiting this visit. My expectations were high. The exteriors are pretty. Just located outside city center 1 makes it a convenient place to eat.  It was lunch time and the pace was already full. However since it was hot summer day we couldn't even think of getting seated outdoors. So while we were waiting we had lemon water which was heaveen!! (The sun has those effects;) ).
Ambience - I was engrossed in watching all the frames and it was interesting to watch that they had all Bollywood movies which were based on Punjabi's. Nice concept. But it's too overcrowded. Tables are so close by that I can hear the conversation beside my table. No privacy. I didn't mind it that much though. Also I liked the ambience would just prefer to visit it on a day with less crowd so I can take in the ambience. Its pretty..
Coming to the food as soon as I ordered the tandoori aloo I loved it.proper charcoal smoked aloo with the perfect mint chutney. And was expecting the main course to be awesome.however was disappointed. Also the waiters are argumentative. I mean they teach u about the ingredients and taste as if we don't know. This happened even with the customers beside me. The naans were chidda.kabuli nan was yucks!!!!  Also the sabzis were very oily and full of spice we had ordered kashmiri ka some sabzi but it was pathetic. I loved the dal and it was the only saviour. This place just didn't workout for me.

Just as you enter , you will feel the decor inside showcasing a pure punjabi dhaba , from ceiling to every wall leaving nothing uncovered ! Lovely ambience . We just ordered Balle Chicken Biriyani & when it was served ... the smell took us away . And after we had the first pile in our mouth ... oooh just awesome ... pure punjabi biriyani , a bit spicy . The chicken was of good size , marinated well & soft & juicy .

Biriyani there is a must ! And the location makes it accessible , just beside Salt Lake City Centre . Including tax , per plate was Rs.191 /- ;)

The moment one enters the restaurant, the strong aroma of the tandoor swoops across the nostrils. The food here was utterly delicious. Had ordered for ' Chicken Padahi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Masala and Mutton boti curry' all of which were fabulous. The chicken was extremely soft and tender, and the curries were very tasty. Definitely try out the lassi!

A good restaurant with reasonable price. The food taste superb but it lacks some finishing and the final looks. That can be ignored for the price. Only one negative is that the tables are not that spacious. If you order more than 4 starters and then drinks, you wont find the space to place them on the table :) The rating is for the taste of the food and the price :)

A bit crowded on weekends...but not a long queue. Food average.. chicken tikka masala butter nan and sweet lassi was good. The masala papad was horrible.. too salty and too much lemon juice in it.. 
Hence a 3. Nothing special about..a one time visit is enough

Open till 2 AM, dining doesn't get better than this. This outlet of Balle Balle Dhaba is located near the City Center 1 complex at Salt Lake. The interiors would catch your eyes and thoughts for a moment once you enter. The feel is not something that you get when you enter a dhaba but it's exquisitely decorated with many many pictures on the walls. The ambiance is nice with a vibe of its own. When it comes to ordering food, it's simply awesome. The service ia prompt and the prices are reasonable here.

One if the best in the area to get the taste of authentic North Indian food.

Must try:
Tandoori Chicken,
Mutton¬†Nalli¬†Kebab,
Tandoori Pomfret,
Mutton¬†Adrak Ke Panje,
Methi Paratha,
Mutton Biryani,
Gajar Ka Halwa

I recently visited this awesome restaurant. It does not give a feel of conventional Dhaba. However it is a casual dining restaurant which serves good quality food at reasonable price. Away from the hustle and bustle if you go after 10pm. This place is open till 2 midnight. The kitchen is live and transparent to the foodies. All the items we ordered were lip smacking and they serve good portion enough for two people to share. Kebabs are good and Butter Chicken is amazing a must try for the foodies. We are definitely visiting this place after watching our next good movie.

Love the way they hv decked the place with frames after frames of sardar jokes and movies... giving a punjabi feel.... stays busy untill late at night... try the kebabs... a special mention for the dal makhani ... the clear winner amongst the kebab... mutton biryani... chicken lababdar that we ordered.... Too bad the service is not that good... I suppose their understaffed based on the no..of customers to waiters ratio.. Prompt service would have been better. That would be all... The waiters hv good knowledge abt the dishes they serve and suggest well..

Dhaba meets swag-is the description that I find most suited for this place . Located just beside city centre 1 saltlake ,this hugely popular joint is thronged by youngsters and families alike . While the indoors are peppy and vibrant I kind of more prefer their outdoor sitting especially during the winter months when I happened to visit the place . .While food is pretty much the usual predictable stuff at a dhaba/north indian restaurant ‚ÄìI must mention that they are absolutely yummy. Their methi paratha and gajar ka halwa is a must try . Prices are reasonable enough though not cheap . Overall a wonderful place to dig onto that hearty dhaba food with your friends and family !

I was very excited to go to balle balle dhaba as I had heard a lot of praises abt the place.. The place was crowded on a Friday too,but v luckily got a table n didn't have to wait.. Parking there is a bit of a problem as they have space fr abt 4-5 cars only. Coming to the food now, v ordered mutton boti kabab, lasuni murgh and pahadi chicken for starters. The mutton kabab was soft n it melted in the mouth but the pahadi kabab or the lasuni murgh weren't too great. V ordered chicken lababdar, Navratan korma, Dal tadka,garlic naan n tandoori roti.. The Navratan korma was too sweet fr my liking,the chicken was lip smacking and so was the garlic naan.. Dal was nothing too great n rather a bit spicy.. Food lacked tht typical dhaba flavour for which u go looking to the place.

This place is a small joint which serves yummy food. I am a frequent visitor to this place and absolutely love it.¬†

The ambience gets little less than full marks only because it is a little congested. I hope they expand the space some time soon. They have pictures on the wall and the ceiling of almost every famous Punjabi personality along with Punjabi movie posters. This is very appealing.

Coming to the food, the kebabs have never disappointed me. Fish Tikka Amritsari is my personal favourite. If you are a fish lover, it is a must try. I have also tasted pahari kebab and lasuni kebab which are equally amazing. Though Chicken Reshmi and Tikka kebab are nothing unusual. I am yet to try Tandoori Pomfret.

For main-course, I have tried several breads from their menu. Each time they were served hot and perfectly soft. Mutton Tarka was too spicy on two occasion though Mutton Rara Punjabi is a perfect hit. Kadhai paneer is a must try for all vegans. The paneer is soft and tastes good.¬†

Dont forget to add masala cold-drink along with your order when you are visiting this place. It is very refreshing and acts as a palate cleanser.

I am yet to write about the best part about this place. The price is very reasonable considering the food quantity as well as the quality. Ideal place to land up right after shopping at City Centre.

Orderd Butter tandoori roti,paneer butter masala,chicken biryani,chicken masala. The quantity was good.tandoori roti was perfectly cooked.Biryani was good bt quite oily.
Nxt on asthami nite we ordered paneer tikka, chicken kebab,tandoori roti,kadhai paneer,dal makhni nd a chicken special dish(don't remember the name). I would say everything was tasty but not extraordinary given the price and seating arrangement. It's a small place with cramped seating area I would say.

The best thing about this Dhaba is that there is no fixed timing for lunch and dinner. We can practically walk in at anytime after 12 noon and order anything. Also I came to know, they are open till very late in the night. :D
The staffs are really courteous and non-interfering. I mean, they tolerated a gang of noisy camera crazy girls for 2hours without asking us to tone down.
As for the food, really delicious punjabi food and well within budget. The Nali kebaab is overpriced. Instead, the chicken pahaari kebab is a must have. The chicken lababdar is also quite mouth-watering. Lassi is below the mark. And as for the firni, I really think we should have tried the kulfi instead.

So this place has a catchy name. You would expect to see some naach gaana but all you find is walls and ceiling with pictures of sardars. I liked the idea but could have been done way better. As for the food its basic and normal by all standards. The masala kultcha was good and everything else was nothing special.

A vibrant ambience with the lovely food. Although we ordered a pretty much of things like Pahari kabab, Mutton Nalli Kabab, ¬†( a very high priced one in respect to the kababs) and much more but it was truly worth the taste .I think one should must try the pahari kabab and chicken lababdar, along with the garlic nun . Both made me think that I may visit the place twice . One thing that I won't recommend is keema paratha. The keemas were very loosely stuffed and it got scattered more in the plate than in the mouth. The lassi was yummylicious but the firni wasn't worth the try.But then if you like punjaban khana ,try it once!

Balle Balle Dhaba is located slightly ahead of City Centre I and is owned by the same establishment that owns Honey da Dhaba.¬†

On a previous occasion when I visited this restaurant, I had a few complaints and I am very happy to say that not only did they promise to look into it, but they actually did, since my next visit was a wonderful experience.¬†

The restaurant is¬†decorated¬†with colorful, comic and Bollywood posters and frames everywhere, from the walls to the ceiling. It is quite colorful and¬†Bollywood¬†music is¬†always playing in the background. They also have a small area of outdoor seating, with wooden tables and chairs and¬†lanterns, which I've never had¬†the opportunity of experiencing, owing to the winter and mosquitoes, but maybe, next time.¬†

Coming to the food, the Lassi is a must-have. It is thick and creamy and they have an option of sweet or salted. Next, we ordered a Tandoori Paneer while my friends ordered a Tandoori Chicken. The Paneer was slightly chewy, but the Chicken, I was told, was succulent and flavorful.¬†

For main course, we had Palak Paneer, Chicken Lababdar, Chana Masala, Pudina Paratha, Methi Paratha, Naan and a Mixed Raita. The Chicken Lababdar and Palak Paneer were brilliant (the paneer was extremely soft here and melted in my mouth). The Chana Masala was okay-ish, nothing extraordinary. Now, what actually stole the show was the Methi and Pudina Paranthas. Crisp layers, sprinkled with Methi and Pudina, respectively, and generously slathered with butter. I loved it!

The quantities are great and the bill won't burn a hole in your pocket. However, I have a suggestion to make: Please, please introduce more vegetarian Tandoori items and Kebabs in your menu!

So, the ratings for Balle Balle would be as follows:

AMBIENCE: 3.5/5

FOOD: 4.5/5

SERVICE: 4/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 4.5/5

Living in salt lake, I've been to this restaurant plenty of times.Located just beside city centre mall, Its a place which always manages to catch your eyes because of its name and the giant and cheerful board outside. Its possible that you might have to wait for sometime before you get a place.
From inside it looks appealing with all the punjabi jokes and everything related to the punjabi culture stick to the walls (and the roof!!!!). I ll give full marks to this idea as it does manages to create a punjabi mood.
However, I did found the tables and seats crammed up. They could have utilised the space better. The atmosphere in the restaurant is usually very noisy and its not possible to talk. So, having a decent meal is the only option you're left with. :P
Now coming to the food and the service. I found the following thing which will help you to consider this plsce....I ll jot it down in points....!!
- insufficient menu considering its a punjabi restaurant
- the waiters are few and sad. They serve many ppl at the same time
- food is not that good too
- cant handle the high demand created coz of its location.
- they dont give complementary salads with main course, not even onions.
- the salads when ordered looks clumsy as if done in a hurry.
Its also worth mentioning that this place is open late till night.
Overall...an okay place to satisfy your hunger if eating indian is the only option.
Location- 4/5
Ambience- 3.5/5 (noise does affect it)
Food- 3/5
Service staffs: 3/5

Ambience: Pathetic. Tables are too
Close to each other. Always very noisy and on top of that poor Bollywood music. 

Food: Very average. Nothing great about their starters as well as main course. Nan and rotis are not properly cooked. Only thing hot and crispy we got was papad. 

Service: Again below average. Glasses and plates were not properly cleaned. Understaffed.

We ordered food from Balle Balle, very bad food, very poor service, arrogant staff including the manager. We took food home and while serving found out they have packed lesser nos of naans and kulchas and when we called them, they were least bothered about it and said it happens. The invoices are never billed for lesser amount but the food is always. The waiters and so called managers were so uncooperative and misbehaved wont advice anyone to visit that place.

We were near by city centre and looking for a place for lunch. Came to know about it and its really worth the plan. 

Food was great. I can recall some dishes like Amritsari daal, punjabi chicken, malai kofta. They are mouthwatering flavourful. A little costly..but if you want to savour your testbuds with a thrill..its a treat to visit here.

The place is well located . Just 100 metres from city centre made it a popular name . But that's exactly why it needs more space for customers. The place us well decorated with paintings and photos . Some of those photos are decorated without much thinking,hence, I presume that the interior designer lacks creativity .
Coming to the main part , the FOOD . The food is well cooked and the Punjabi traditional cooking is maintained while preparing those . We had ordered veg and non-veg dishes which were sufficient to subdue our hunger . I personally had a sumptuous dinner and got the pleasure to see some happy faces when stepped outside the restaurant.
The only downside which affects you directly is that the service was not its plus point. The people were slow to react to customers demands, and often confused. They had little idea about how the food would taste which we ordered . Disappointing faces . Faces without smiles. Other than that,the place was satisfactory. If you're short on money but want to have a good dinner-go to Balle Balle dhaba.

I am extremely disappointed with this outlet. After reading raving reviews, when I went there with my friends I found it nothing great than a road-side dhaba. Food was just ok. Nothing great about it. What irked me most is the horrific customer service. People there dint know how to swipe cards in the machine. And the attitude was absolutely intolerable. It was like they are doing a favor by serving us. If given an option, wouldn't go there ever.

The biriyani offered here is better than arsalan(any outlet). They offer the best chicken tandoori in kolkata trust me on this  though price is bit high. Mutton rara punjabi is undoubtedly the most authentic mutton dish i have ever had in my life. Mutton boti masala also tasted out of the ordinary.

I visited this place at saraswati puja, went with a bit hope, place was cozy, a little bit small but comfortable nontheless, started with kebab , ordered Dahi kebab and chiken reshmi, dahi kebab was delight, wonderfull flavour, nicely cooked, chicken was so so, nothing to mention, then went for main course, ordered paneer kadhai and butter nun, nun was not up to mark, butter was less, it was not soft, then there was paneer, which was no where near to kadhai paneer, and it was over hot, I stopped myself ordering anything more from that point, I would love to visit here someday, to try its non veg main course, for now I am rating with my current experience..

Place is small but food is good yummy. Interiors are comfy. The walls and the roof is covered and decorated with framed photos of punjabi celebrities, popular punjabi characters, sporrtsmen, artists etc. Best thing about this pace is that it stays open till around 12 o clock at night. Somehow I always had to wait for atleast 15 mins before I got a seat as this place is always (read both weekend and weekdays) crowded. In all will I be going back here? Yes, definitely.

Visited Balle Balle Dhaba, on one fine cool afternoon and sat outside to get a feel of the so called Dhaba Culture. Being there for the first time, at the outset I was shocked to see the rush and volume of people inside as well as outside.

Anyhow managed to get a seat somehow, and ordered that days special that were mentioned on the board:

Food : Order was Makki di Roti, Butter Naan, Sarsong da Saag, Creamy Chicken and Gajar ka halwa. To be honest makki di roti and butter nan was as usual. Good to taste. ¬†The best part of the meal was Sarsong da Saag. It was absolutely yummy and wished for more. However Creamy Chicken was a complete thumbs down, as it was unbelievable sweet. This proved that a continental preparation should not be served in a outlet like this because creamy chicken needs to be thick and creamy and not sweet and sugary. Anyhow gajar ka halwa was nice, although nothing great.

Overall a good place to try once in a while, as its easy on the pocket and rapid service is provided.

Location: Very near CC1,opposite the Petrol Pump near it. You wouldn't miss the colourful sign for sure ;)Ambience: Just what you expect from a dhabba. Loud,quirky interior decor ,walls filled with pictures of famous Punjabis,and LOTs of Sunny Deol. An open kitchen too,which I love :DService: Good. Waiters are attentive and co operative. You get your food within 10 to 15 minutes.Food: GOOOOOOOOD! Heavy,buttery,spicy,yummy punjabi food. Go for their kebabs,butter naan,chicken tikka masala and chicken bharta. The biryani is pretty awesome too. Ample quantity. One biryani and one chicken is enough for two. :)Cost: Around all their items range between 175 to 375,but with VAT and service tax and stuff,you end up paying around a 100 bucks more.Overall: Definitely worth a try! :)

Quite an impeccably decorated dhaba.... ¬†with comfortable seating arrangements.. both inside the restaurant and even outside. Sitting outside on a winter eve was fun.. with a couple of friends... i wish they manage to get the spirit license soon....¬†

Food off course is mouthwatering... we ordered a palate of kebabs consisting of the most popular one.. "mutton nahli ke kebab" though not featured in the menu... but d moment you'll look around to see what others are relishing... the big mutton paya will catch your attention. ¬†best part was the chicken tadka... a dinning experience in a dhaba without trying the lassi and tadka is somewhat unimaginable.... overall a wonderful place.. though there is la little space crunch... but the yummilicious food... successfully diverts your mind....

I love al fresco , so having the arrangement for one, balle balle wins .5 from me.¬†
Now, the decor inside looked so interesting with the wall paintings stuck on the ceiling. The music was good. The people friendly and pro-active. We ordered, tandoori chicken, butter naan, palak paneer and dal makhani. Mostly veg yes... but me being almost a carnivorous when it comes to food , i must say, i loved the veg food that was served. The palak paneer was yum!! the paneer not only soft but seemed do have seeped the palak juices in and the dal makhani was creamy and thick just the way i love it. Naan was soft all throughout the dinner time, which i highly appreciate and the tandooris were big and succulent. I loved it and i am planning my next visit.¬†

As the name sounds, the balle balle dhaba offers foods which are excellent and will certainly enliven your mood and spirits. Apart from cozy ambience the dhaba has awesome food items to satisfy its customers. For a person like me who drools over kebab, bharta, tikka, find the place perfect as it offers foods which are tasty and appetizing. On the first day, plate of dahi kebab, chicken bharta, and keema matar was simply superb as it was quite fulfilling. But on the second day I was prepared to order a full meal with my friends, I was simply bowled over their menu which was full with spicy traditional Indian khana from where we chose tandoori pomfret, chicken tikka masala, mutton shahi korma. Paneer pulao was best with the whole combination. The spicy items went very well with the rice, I just loved that. The next was masala omlete which was completely different from the usual egg preparations. As I am very fond of fish, we ordered prawn butter masal and fish tikka butter masala. Lastly we had lassi to cool down the razzmatazz of the whole day. it was simply un forgettable.

Last Sunday me and my husband went to try out this joint. First we had to wait for more than half an hour as it was quite crowded. The place is filled up with hundreds of frames depicting "Punjabiness" and it is very congested. The adjacent tables almost touch each other and no privacy is there. Coming to the food, it was average. The tandoori chicken was good, the nans were very hard, almost like a papad, though the masala kulcha was good. The mutton preparation was extremely average. Don't expect anything lavish.

It was around 4-4.30 in the afternoon on a weekday when my friend and I found ourselves near city centre 1 in salt lake after a tiring and hectic day of some official work.We decided upon this place for our lunch and we ended up having a pleasant experience.

The moment we entered,the vibrance of the place caught our attention.Even on a weekday and at such an odd time,this place was full and buzzing! The place is not the biggest but the space is utilized nicely.There is facility for outdoor seating also.The seating arrangements are not the most comfortable and are a little bit cramped up owing to the small space.The decor consists of picture frames of various Punjabi icons and movies on the walls which add to the Punjabi dhaba feel.The ambience in short is not the classiest but very vibrant and colourful.

Coming to the food,we had pudina paratha,chicken bharta and keema matar.The food was served swiftly.The pudina paratha looked quite attractive and was quite nice but it lacked the fragrance of the pudina,may be because it was fried.The chicken bharta and the keema matar were both very rich in terms of taste.The chicken bharta specially was really delicious.We were satisfied with our meal both in terms of quality and quantity.

The waiters are nice and helpful.The service is swift.The prices are very reasonable.I really liked the idea of the open kitchen.I think it really added to the charm of the place.

Overall city center area needed a place like this offering tasty food at reasonable prices and Balle Balle dhaba has surely delivered on that front.The menu here is not that extensive and the ambience is not the classiest but they do a good job at whatever they serve.The fact that they are open till 2am in the night is also another positive factor.I will surely be back to try out the other items on the menu.

It was really hard to get a seat on the 1st of Jan in a good place and as this place was located just beside the city centre we have to wait for half an hour. After than we got a seat at the corner. First thing that caught my eyes was the innumerable pictures of different 'Punjabi puttar' of real and reel life..from Yuvraj Singh, Milkha Singh to Sunny Deol. The was a little congested. We have ordered Chicken Pahari Kebab, masala kulcha, naan, Chicken Bharta and sweet lassi. They tasted good specially the Bharta was yummy. Service was quick. Totally enjoyed..Recommended..

"Balle Balle Dhaba" the place lives upto its name. After having a meal here your heart goes balle balle. Cozy place, nice ambience, fine staff... A perfect setup.

The only problem i faced was, i went alone in this restaurant, therefore couldn't try everything. Infact i was able to order their signature dish only "mutton nahli ke kebab" (the dish is not in their menu and comes only on order). Believe me guys its one of a kind dish in India. I am a delhihite and i travel alot. Never had a better mutton dish cooked in a tandoor. The qty was huge and i was not able to complete the dish by myself. Having a full tummy, dint stop me from drooling on the dishes and aroma coming from the adjacent tables.

If you are a true meat lover and you are in Kolkatta, you cant afford to miss this place.

We went to this SO CALLED dhaba this new year, and the way they attend customers is rrally bad. 
They have some seats outside, but the seats are dirty.
Tried 3 tables, they were not balanced, so had to change it again and again.

Coming to the food, prices are so high with what they deliver. 
We ordered one mutton biriyani in which we found an insect. 
Kadhai paneer, it was the worst i ever had.
Butter naan : average.

Service is too bad,they take lot of time in taking order and then giving it.
They even take so much time in bringing the bill.

NOT RECOMMENDED.

Firstly the ambiance ... The seating space is a bit less..the outer seating area is ok...
Now as far as food goes I am a veggie and tried almost all the starters available on the menu and found them good. And regarding the main course items I found them a bit sweet something that does not suits the name. However the food was good.  All in all good place to hang out with frnds.

Lastly ,they don't accept credit/debit cards so please don't forget to carry cash.

Visited to have lunch on 25th...The taste of the foods are good...the environment  is also good...and the main thing its very much pocket friendly...but the quantity of the food should be more...i had kababs nd biriyanis...bt still i was hungry...the pieces of the kababs are very small...the quantity of the biriyani was also less...so quantity should be increased. The sitting should be more comfortable...eating should be done comfortably.  Otherwise the dhaba is good...

Balle balle dhaba is a superb option for late night dining or take away in salt lake area.

Located right beside city centre mall, it's a decent sized restaurant with walls and ceiling full of framed pictures that looks attractive but not so classy. The staff service is fast but they are not as polished. The rates are very reasonable so that is passable. Overall I felt the place to be a bit short on comfort. 

Coming to food, kebabs were pretty good especially the seekh and dahi kebab. The main course consisted of dal makhani, paneer tikka masala and naan which were all pretty good with a special mention for the black dal that was delightful. The pulao was a let down though and tasted dry, weird.

Overall, a great place to eat when you have a budget contraint or want to grab a quick bite or for a late night dining !!!

Ordered biryani,  rayta and chicken tandoori. The first thing disappointed me,  the biryani was not punjabi at all except the restaurant name and photographs framed inside. I was expecting some authentic punjabi food.  Rayta was awesome and chicken was good. 

I recommend not to expect punjabi food,  good place to hang out with friends.

Located just beside city centre 1, this restaurant is a treat to all Indian cuisine lovers. The first thing you notice as soon as you get in is  the oh-so-Punjabi d√©cor, the very second thing that you notice is the visible kitchen space which is very clean and very hygienic to our delight. The walls and the ceiling are full of frames that has a Punjabi element to it.

Now coming to the food, we were a group of five people and we ordered a Pahari Kebab, 6 Butter nan, 1 Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, 1 Chicken Butter Masala and 2 Sweet Lime Soda. The Pahari Kebab had 5 pieces and a little bit to the spicy side but the taste was not at all compromised. For a light eater person like me, 1 Nan was enough and went absolutely well with the Tikka Butter Masala and the Chicken Butter Masala. I should mention here that the Butter Masala they make has shredded chicken and the taste s balanced with just a bit of sweetness. And I cannot complain about the Sweet Lime Soda either. Only thing is, the price is little bit on the higher side but then again the location has a role to play.

Balle balle dhaba may not be your typical dhaba setting (no charpaai or hindi/punjabi gaane blaring from the radio, or the familiar sight of turbanned sardarjis gulping down a tall tumbler of lassi.. ) , but nonetheless, it has a very interesting decor.Right from milkha singh to yo yo Honey Singh-uh.. they all greet you from frames on the walls and the ceiling.Very nice..
Coming to the food, it serves North Indian fare at a reasonable enough price. I have tried the Chicken biriyani, the butter naan, chicken bharta and some other stuff.Good quality as well as quantity ( doesnt overstuff or understuff you ).And all this @ a price that doesnt burn a hole in your pocket.Well, service tends to get a bit delayed because of the crowd.

A bit of an advice from a good foodie-samaritan: It gets really crowded, especially on weekends, so you might have to wait a bit.But the waiting period is really worth it.

Happy eating! :)

Coming to the food and service, I have always had their biriyani and it is simply great. Tried their chicken reshmi kababs which are also tasty. Overall food is really great in here. Service is fast.

For starter .reshmi was as usual but Motton rolly was awesome Motton was so soft and juicy. Specially Motton was presented with the shape of chicken lollypop. Rest the item for main course tandoori roti, naan, navratan korma, chicken butter masala were nothing special

A 5 star rating for late night eats.Centrally located and very easy to find to crush your mid night hunger.We ordered some of the chicken delicacies and that i would hit as 4 star.Chicken lahsuniya kebab was not that great as expected (what their menu says).

Ambiance was fully fadu and might give you a real feel of roadside dhaba. These guys has done a hard job to collect so many pictures to give you a real feel of PUNJAB.3 cheers to that !!!

Service was moderate ..the guy openly told for 20 minutes to place the order.Overall i would rate this place as 4.0 but because of money matters it is a 3.8 star but a must visit to enjoy a heavy dinner with your friends and family.

Balle Balle Dhaba is very conveniently located right at City Center in Salt Lake.

The parking space for Balle Balle Dhaba is a challenge since there is little or no space for parking in front of the restaurant and best place to park is at City Center parking lot and walk down to this restaurant.

The restaurant is a hybrid dhaba. On one side, it has a classy look and on the other, all attempt has been given to provide a dhaba like feeling with metal chairs and tables and with walls full of punjabi postes and photographs. The space inside is a bit cramped (especially when the restaurant is full). There is provision of sitting outside also with 4-5 tables set outside. 

We reached there at around 7:15pm in the evening and occupied a table inside. Here is what we ordered:

1) Tandoori Chicken Full - Rs 350/-

2) Butter Naan - Rs 35/- per piece

3) Plain Basmati Rice - Rs 95/-

3) Chicken Lababdar - Rs 260/-

4) Butter Chicken - Rs 295/-

5) Lassi (Sweet) - Rs 75 per glass

At the time when we entered, there were two or three families seated. By 8:00pm, the restaurant was jam packed (that too on a Tuesday night!).

Service is a bit on the slower side and the staff needs to be more trained and efficient. With the entire restaurant full, they were having a hard time taking orders and serving at the tables. 

It took us quite some time before our order was delivered. I must admit that although delayed, the food was really great. The taste of all the dishes was superb. The rice was of very high quality. The best of the lot was the Lassi. I would recommend everyone visiting this restaurant to compulsorily order for their lassi. I have had lassi at multiple dhabas but this one was thick, made entirely from dahi (very little or no water added) and tasted awesome.

In the end, it was a good dinner. I would recommend Balle Balle Dhaba for others to have good, tasty Punjabi food at standard price. If you are planning to visit this restaurant, make sure you have 1-2 hours in hand.

The ambiance was great. Particularly the setting and the diversified wall hangings.
The food too was delicious and reasonably priced. The service was also hospitable.
On the downside, the place is pretty small and hence feels cramped.

The food is decent. 
I have 1 big issue. The restaurant is cramped for room. There's hardly 7-8 inches gap between tables. Vegetarians like us have issues with it. I wish the carpet area were bigger. Overall experience can be much better. Lots of room for improvement.

Located beside city centre salt lake. The decor is really impressive. U will get the feel of dhaba as they have outdoor service along with the indoor. The kababs were okay okay type. But the chicken biriyani was terrible. The chicken within the biriyani was not properly cooked. However the mutton biriyani was better. I really liked their chicken bharta. Finally the lassi made our dinner better. U can give a try to this restaurant because its a pocket friendly one :)

After much anticipation, we went there on a weekday for dinner. It is full of framed posters relating to every Punjabi thing possible. They are really trying to make a point. Well, we get it. 
Arriving at the food point, we ordered the whole deal : Roti, Naan, Pulao, Biryani, Tarka, Butter Chicken, Kulfi.
Everything was good except the Kulfi. With no malai flavor, no falooda, it almost had a synthetic taste.
Overall, it's worth taking multiple trips.

Fantastic food that made us come back again and again. Personally I found their chicken tandoori simply out of the world. The fish amritsari tikka kabab was great too. 
We also tried the biriyani, which was very good but was slightly oily. The chicken pieces were humungous. 
Do not forget to try their Hot Gajar Ka Halwa. One plate is enough for 3/4 people.

The Reshmi kebab was brilliant,the paneer Tika's marination was brilliant.
Today's special was the mutton nalli kebab which we thought were small pieces of bone Marrow but it turned out to be the lower leg, it was disgusting to look at and to taste. But then came the main course. Which was too good.
Ordered mushroom masala and it is hands down the best mushroom sabji I have ever had. 
The dal tardka was good and so was the kadai paneer.

A must visit when you are in suburbs!! 
A good break from the core city circle.

I was a bit skeptical to go to this as we are vegetarians and my wife is very particular about it and she had heard it is  non veg preffered . but I must say that we were quite impressed after going there.They have an open kitchen and the food served seemed to be hygienic and freshly prepared. We ordered pander tikka which was good. In mains we ordered mix veg and dal makhni and believe me the dal was heavenly properly smeared in butter with accurate spices and salt made to perfection. The veg was also OK. The breads need special mention the tandoori roti was crisp and the rumali roti was nicely prepared and was not rubbery or soggy as other places. In dessert we had kulfi which was also good nothing great though. The servings were generous too and rates were reasonable. The seating are a cramped though due to space constrain but that can b ignored .

I had ordered for dal makhani and I was served the sabji with a hen's feather...
The manager and the owner have great attitude... They were talking as if it was my fault... And it was just a small mistake according to them which can happen in a restaurant which serves both veg and non veg food... I was literally going to puke bcoz I'm a vegetarian... Such a thing was unexpected!

Pretty decent place. Food is good and the place is tastefully decorated. Their Paranthas are awesome, especially the Kulcha. Mutton Kebabs are also delicious. You will also get decent north Indian side dishes for vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Their Biriyani is also pretty good and it follows Kolkata style with a big potato on it. They operate till late hours of night and is a ideal hangout with family and friends. Their service is bit on the slower side, but their good food will compensate that.

The decor is very bright and funny. 
I spent most of my time reading the cartoon one liners or the jokes.its actually a good idea since it kept me and my friends occupied while we waited for our yummy meal.

Coming to the food. Aunthentic punjabi!! Yes a little oily per my standard. But being a punjabi food lover i can vouch for the taste!

Naan preparation takes long if u order mid meal. Also, the quantity should have been a little more.

Seating arrangement could have been better. Looks a little clustered. But well, overall, i had a very good experience here. Definetly a recommend!!

We went for dinner on 1st Nov. and we were three persons. The place is very nice. The indoor deco is very well done. We ordered for chicken tandoori, palak paneer, mutter mushroom, amritsari fish tikka, ¬†tandoori roti, lacchha paratha and butter naan. The chicken tandoori and amritsari fish tikka were superb. Also the palak paneer and mushroom mutter were out of the world.

Overall, the food quality and quantity were very good with very good service. Definitely worth visiting. Recommended if you want to taste north Indian cuisine at affordable price.

I really liked their interior, though it was a little clumsy due to its lack of space. 
I had garlic nun and mutton biryani, which I absolutely loved. Garlic nun was awesome.
The service was also good. However I would recommend to lessen a number of tables or do something regarding the space issue since it becomes really uncomfortable when the place is full.

Tandoori food in your mind and you need a stop then I believe dhaba's are the perfect destinations. We were searching a place for dine in a weekend near city center salt lake and we choose this place to have our dinner. In the order we asked them for tandoori chicken,chicken tikka masala and butter naan. The final bill was rs.650. This is an average restaurant to choose for dinning place.
‚Ä†****‚Ä†"********
Today I visited this place again and the experience was far better than last one. I choose chicken biryani and mutton roganjosh. I am satisfied with my order.

Been there with office colleagues for the first time. Small cramped place with the whole place including roof filled with frames of Bollywood, Cricket and Humor. Service was fast considering the full crowd and steady stream of customers walking in. For the food, vegetarian food taste was much better than the non-vegetarian ones which was surprising for a Punjabi dhaba. The Kulchas were good, filling and well cooked. I would recommend not having the kulfi as it was bland. Parking can be an issue considering only 4 vehicles can be parked in front. I would recommend visiting on day time only as am sure considering the location it would be jam packed at dinner time...

Crowded resto. Honestly I didn't find food to be outstanding. Ajad hind or jai hind or even Russell st dhaba r much better than this. Kulcha was gd. Turn off was kadhai paneer. I expect gd paneer dish in dhaba. Daal makhani was average. Most disgusting roasted papad I ever had in my life. 
Service was below average. It was kind of slow. No spoons were given to us. When asked for it, the waiter gave us 'serving spoon' to have our food! No tissues were provided until I asked for. V had to ask for basic items like lemon n salt!
The 'today's special' board mentioned about bhetaki fish which was actually not available at all! V ordered for another fish item which the waiter did not serve us till last. 
I'm just wondering what makes this resto so hit?

Balle Balle Dhaba has recently opened up near city centre. The location makes it quite difficult to park your cars.
The seating is again noisy,crowded owing to festival times. But somehow found it very crampy.
Staff is confused and service is slow.¬†
Chicken Pahari Kabab at 205 per plate and having just 2 pieces of kebab is just not worth it.
Chicken Reshmi Masala was yummy and good. Nice creamy gravy and thats how it should be for reshmi.
Heard so much about Prawn Butter Masala, but an absolute disaster.
The gravy was nothing like Butter Masala. It was a pathetic rich spice tomato based gravy. The pieces of prawn were mostly the head. I don't the reason of this disaster, maybe because of the crowd for durga puja.
Panner Butter Masala was spoilt and tasted sour.¬†
The good part was Peas Pulao and Vegetable Pulao. The rice quality was very good and the pulao taste was perfect. Special mention for veg pulao since it was really nice.

Had visited this place during the Pujas. Naturally, had to wait for quite some time to get hold of a placr to sit. But, trust me it was worth the wait. The ambience is that of a modern dhaba... With amazing filmy(mostly) picture frames fixed in the ceiling.. :)
Coming to the food.. We had ordered 1 murgh tikka butter masala, 2 butter naans, 1 mutton biriyani. 
All the items were really good. Specially the murgh tikka butter masala. The chicken pieces very really soft and succulent. 
Biriyani, too was very good. 
I was impressed mainly coz they could maintain good quality and taste of the food, even during the rush hours of Puja! 

I'd definitely go back to this place again..to try their kebabs :)

We had gone to Balle Balle on Saptami night.. It was crowded and we had to wait for the table.
The decor is quite abstract, quirky and nice. But the chairs aren't comfortable at all... And the place is very packed up. There isn't even place to move around.
The food was okay... we ordered Fish Tikka Amritsari, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Aloo, Dahi Kebab, Egg Tarka, Dal Tarka, Mathi Malai Matar, Garlic Naans, Masala Kulchas and Fresh Lime sodas.
Everything was good. But our waiter forgot to write down the Tandoori Aloo. So after around 15 minutes of waiting when we got to know the problem, we just cancelled the order. And also our Fresh Lime Sodas had no fizz at all. They were completely flat and one of them had an insect or something in it. We got it changed.
The service is slow as well...
The food isnt bad, and they should try to improve of their quality of service to attract more customers.

The quantity vs price ratio goes for a toss here but the good quality food is really impressive. check out the fish amritsari as a starter here.the traditional tikka masala is good too.the firni is highly recommended for those with a sweet tooth. all in all balle balle :)

This one really made a mark with me. The food was really tasty. The person at the reception was humble and connected well with most of the customers.
Some of the common items were not available may be due to durga puja rush. The server made a mistake in not collecting the order properly.
I found the items a little pricy but the ambience justified it.
Open kitchen showed the people in action with the dhaba type look is cool. I would suggest you to go with friends to enjoy the punjabi dishes and the music (its a little loud though). Dont order many varieties..stick with only a couple.

We ordered Chicken tikka kebab...Chicken tikka masala...Mutton Rogan Josh...Masala kulcha...Kulfi..and Firni..
The chicken tikka kebabs were so tender and juicy...I loved it...
I dint like the taste of the gravy in the Chicken tikka masala...
Mutton rogan josh was average...
masala kulchas were made to perfection...
Kulfi too was good...

Friends and family on this year's Panchami decided to meet for late dinner at Balle Balle Dhaba.
We got table for 8 after waiting for 15 minutes. The place has decor of film or cricket posters of individuals from Punjabi origin.
The concept is unique but the place is too congested.
For refreshment we ordered Fresh Lime Soda and Masala cold drinks. Fresh lime tasted pathetic but the masala cola was good.
For starters we went for Chicken pahari kebab, mutton adrak ka panje and mutton nalli kebab. Chicken pahari kebab was soft and succulent. Kids in the group loved it. Mutton Nalli Kebab is one of their specialties and deserve special mention. Mutton Adrak Ka Panja was only huge pieces of bone without any flesh. Complete waste.
In main course opted for Masala Kulcha, Garlic Naan, Butter Chicken boneless, Chicken Tadka and Mutton Boti Masala. Butter Chicken was excellent and similarly pleasing was Chicken tadka. Kulcha was similar to aloo paratha was so so. Garlic Naan has scope of improvement in not having garlic flavour in the naan. Mutton Boti masala was a disaster. It was so though and chewy that the server himself felt embarrassed and replaced the dish. But the replaced dish improved slightly. Instead of chicken tadka they served egg tadka and on realizing their mistake gave correct dish proactively. Starters were served in cheap stainless steel plates. Restaurant who thought to bring uniqueness through decor not sure who they came up with this idea. Also if you are having live kitchen then for viewing pleasure of guests the glass walls needs to cleaned.
Prior leaving we could overhear the servers were discussing how much tip they are expecting from us. 
Providing tip is not a issue but if they concentrate on customer satisfaction and maintaining right quality will be more deserving for tip.

LOUD DECOR!
 It's located right at the edge of the salt lake city centre. The restaurant does not have much of floor space, crowded with adjacent tables pretty close to each other. On the inside there is a glass room where you can watch them making tandoor and kebabs.
The decor is very loud. Every inch of wall space and overlooking roof is hung with posters of Punjabi movies and singers. They also have a wall hanging of Kings XI Punjab right next to the washroom captioned "team logo". They have a small counter for bar too. I am disappointed that we had to wait a while for the attendant to take the order.
We had FISH AMRITSARI for starters. The starter was normal, nothing extraordinary. Probably I made a wrong choice. We ordered CHICKEN LABABDAR and GARLIC NAAN and TANDOORI ROTI for the main course. The chicken side dish was delicious, rich in taste with capsicum and all, goes really well with the bread.
Yeah its a good restaurant and I would definitely recommend it to someone else.

The place has been on my radar for a number of days...finally got a chance for a lunch after a very good movie in Inox....we were six of us and when we reached we were asked to wait for 10 mins to get the table but the waiter arranged within 5 mins by doing some jugaad...we ordered tandoori roti, plain rice, chicken butter masala, chicken tikka masala, chicken bharya and fish tikka masala...the fish was good but I doubt whether they used original berki or not...chicken tikka was awesome as well as the butter masala...I chose to have the bharta last and there came the blow...the bharta was stale! I was towards the end of the lunch and this mishap...immediately called the waiter and they were courteous enough to come and take back the dish and even offered replacement AMD finally didn't charge us...I was just thinking that didn't they check the food they served?? Ended with lassi which was great but over expensive...

The restaurant scored good for their decor but a little cramped...

It is said that first impression is last and mine wasn't that good...

Visiting day - 27th sept,2014 

Food and festival in kolkata.... Wow... 
Durga puja has already started here and I thoroughly enjoy the beauty of this town during this time. Along with that how can I miss the food and fun which I get after having a satisfactory dinner plus the sweet lassi ... Ufff... 
I have to mention, you need to order lassi here.. They were too good...
Pahari kebab, mushroom masala, naan everything was as expected. 
The place is located at center or the salt lake but a bit congested... And the walls are filled with Punjabis and Punjabi movies poster.. 
Service was ok. And food taste is as good as you could get in a dhaba.. Full marks for value of money.

The ambience is very nice. Tried to give a feel of  punjab and things related to punjabis , for example milkha Singh, sunny deol to santa banta jokes....All these were on the wall.
The food is yummy .....Try their super speciality kebab, Mutton nalli kebab (a must try).
I have tried their butter chicken with roti , which was also good.But their FIRNI was not upto the mark.
The service was fast and prompt but I had to ask them to clean the table, May be it was due to the rush as I had to be in queue prior getting the table.
They have their own car parking space infront of the restaurant.
Though the place is little cramped but they have tried to fit in as many tables as  possible , overall a nice experience and the location of the restaurant is also good , just at the exit of CC1.
Lastly they can also use the table just infront of the restaurant (non ac) during evenings or through out winter.

Ok so i had the opportunity to dine in this place last month. It was a birthday party of one of my cousins, and we left home late. Being a resident of Salt lake, we were looking for some fine dining places around the area, but most of them wouldnt take orders after 10 o'clock. Thats when we found this place right outside CC1. Its hard to miss really, ¬†with its big neon lights and spectacular display of film posters :DWe ordered chicken reshmi kebabs as a starter. They were quite good. Nothing extraordinary. For the main course we had butter naans,Mutton Rogan Josh,Mutton boti masala.The mutton dishes were excellent,specially the Mutton Boti masala. Soft,tender and well cooked pieces of mutton.A must try here.The gravy wasnt very lip smacking in the rogan josh though.. but its ample quantity and the sizes of the pieces made up for it.Lastly we had kulfi.All in all it was a very good endeavour to satisfy our taste buds :)Prices are bit on the higher end but nothing very dear.The best thing i liked about the place was that it remains open till 2 in the night.The one thing i felt lacking was efficient staff.The cleaning staff took time to arrive to clean the tables,the water bowl was provided after quite some time and even there wasnt anyone to fill up our glasses with water and we had to request them time and again to do so,even though food arrived pretty quick.

With "above reasonable" price and a modern decor it is quiet tough to put this place under a genre. At a first sight I would rather put it under the class of a "fine dining dhaba".
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†
To start off the decor and ambiance is pretty nice. A rather cozy place. Service is relatively quick. But if I am not being too critical then the waiters could do with a little smile. Honestly I was a bit intimidated by the waiter that served me.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†
Lets cut the chase and come to the point. The food was "average" when compared to the price & "above average" when it came to the taste. Presentation was the same old mundane stuff, absolutely not what one would expect from a places in this genre.¬†The chicken pahari kebab did live up-to the name with its green mossy appearance as one would find a hill to be. The tandoori roti was as usual, nothing specifically mentionable & the chicken lababdar was again "average". I would have loved to try out the lassi but chose against it as a group of ladies, sitting just beside me, kept on complaining about it being overtly sweet.

To sum up, with its location just beside city center I, with so many other eateries around, its worth visiting once, neither as a last resort nor as the first one.

On a scale of 5:

Ambiance- 3
Menu- 2.5
Food- 3
Hospitality- 1

Price- 2.5

Well it was a shopping party from my offyc to city centre 1 when i and a colleague of mine started to feel hungry in the midst of shopping..just outside we met this place..an awesomely decorated place,with real faaaaast service..the chicken bharta still tingles my taste glands..tadka was equally awesome..one drawback is that they dont offer alcohol..otherwise its an awesome place to try out..

I ordered butter roti he gave me tandoori, i ordered papad it came as desserts at the end. They can't provide a fork even. but yeah you'll have a mind bobbling Bill which makes you feel like ehhhh why i came here, I should have ate a paw bhaji may have slept empty stomach.

The dhaba near city center was probably something that was long due but somehow it feels very clumsy. The interior decor is filled with posters depicting Punjab in every possible way and the seating is not very comfortable. The food would be above average and the service was really slow when we visited. It is not ideal for a visit if you're visiting with your family although going out with your friends is fine.

Oye balle balle...well a noisy environment and a conjusted one but when you are with friends and match is on stream, that doesn't matter at all.
Coming to food, I liked it. The taste and the flavour of the punjabi dal is what you get. Unfortunately I had to try out veg, so no comments for non-veg items. I had ordered masala papad, rice, amritsari dal, tandoori roti and mushroom masala. Dal is what you ought not to miss.
Overall I liked it and feel stuffed with contented food.

Went with medium expectations. But it turned out to be a great experience. The food was scrumptious. Started with good old tandoori chicken, it was just too good. Then came the Kashmiri naan and butter naan along with Chicken Lababdar. Again it was above expectations. The ambience is really nice, slightly pretentious but fun. I recommend.

This is my 3rd visit to this place after 07.09.14 as I was unhappy with last experience and today I was in hurry so I had to choose this.

But but but....

I had not any idea that they will improve so much...

I ordered masala kulcha & paneer tikka butter masala.
1 kulcha is more than sufficient for a person & the "sabji" is so much that 2 & 1/2 person can eat conveniently.
Taste & quality also improved very much.

Only 2 downsides::
a. The plate was not clear, it had dried gravy from last use so I had instructed them to change it.
b. The glass top of table was broken & covered with tapes but that too was giving way to the sharp glass edges. My palm cud be slashed but fortunately it didn't happen.

Please do send this updated review to them.

Pros: Located beside one of the most popular malls of Kolkata, this resto serves good food! Dhaba like feel with Punjabi blend all over. Try the wide range of kebabs where Chicken Pahari Kebab requires a special mention.
Cons: The slow service. Uncomfortable 'seat'ings.
Don't leave the place without: Havin' Chicken Pahari Kebab ofcourse!

Located just outside city center  the main attraction is its catchy colourful   name board with "BALLE BALLE DHABA" inscribed on it. The place is well lit with some funny and interesting photo frames covering all the walls and yes even the ceiling! the service is amazing with quite good north indian food. The breads were soft and the cholas was rightly cooked. Though the tarka dal didn't taste that good but the overall food and service was good.

The food was on our table within minutes of our order. The decor was also so damn cool. The price didn't pinch the pocket too bad either! In short, I loved this place!

The place looked promising. I liked the decor and the entrance. But one very big issue i had was the feeling of being cramped. They have tried to accommodate as many covers as possible and while that is alright it just makes seating really uncomfortable. The seats aren't too good either. That aside the starters we ordered - tandoori chicken and pahari chicken were really nice. Succulent juicy and great to taste. The main course though was a different story. The chicken bharta and chola we ordered was not up to the mark. The dal and kulcha were decent. We do get much better food in the city. The bill came and at 500 per head for a meal at a dhaba it definitely was on the steep side. There is huge scope for improvement in the service area as well. The thing that is going for this place is it remains open till late. You can give it a try if you are having a midnight hunger pang.

Let's directly get down to pros and cons:
Pros:
Tasty food. We had tandoori chicken which was good, palak paneer which was OK but little excess oily, naan again good and Masala papasd and fresh lime soda pop which were OK.
Fast Service
Reasonably price: All the above came for INR700
Con's
Service: Cleaning of tables not proper. Had to ask thrice to clean the table and finally got cleaned after a shout in the middle of the meal.
Mint sauce was conveniently served from another table with the bowl containing food from the previous eaters.
Hygiene: Compromised to provide fast service.
Like to add post my visit on 15Nov14 that service is quite dismal with staff not eager to take orders or give the bill once done. Food served was however hygienic this time and taste continues to be great.

Went there with a friend for a quick lunch on a saturday afternoon. The location was easy to find. We had ordered kebabs and they were delicious. The butter chicken was out of the world. The kebab and vegetable pulao is a must try. The keema naan was a disappointment. ¬†The only problem was that I found someone's hair in my vegetable pulao. I called for the waiter and he was prompt in replacing it. Will visit the place again.

Suggestion: Please advice your chefs to cover their head while cooking. They were seen without head covers when i had a look at the kitchen. Rest the food was good.

Well the first problem about this place is parking.  You can't park your car outside the dhaba . You need to park somewhere far . The food is good but not the dhaba food you expect in a dhaba . I ordered tandoori mushroom after 5 min they said it was not available . Then I ordered daho kebab and again after 5 min trey said it was not there . So as being a vegetarian the only option I had was tandoori aloo. It was good . For main course I ordered dal tarka which was somewhat like a dhaba type but not a proper dhaba one and is also ordered paneer butter masala which was like normal restaurant . Kulcha was ok types and garlic nan . The corner part of the nan was crispy which was very difficult to eat . The fresh lime was pathetic . The glass used for fresh lime  was like a footpath restaurant and moreover you can see the lemon seeds in the freshlime for which I have to tell them to PLEASE remove it . The ambience was good with all related to punjabi photo frames and the concept of open kitchen was nice as we can see the kitchen is clean . Lol .

Went there for a quick meal with siblings. Not being sure about the serving size we went conservative only the Chicken Bharta and Dal Makhani, with couple of butter Naans and a Keema Naan. We started with the lassi though. Simple but thick. The servings were large enough for the three of us and quite tasty. The Chicken Bharta does deserve a special mention for being good. The Keema Naan though was a disappointment. I had no clue where the Keema was in the Naan. Have had far better stuff to be honest.

Will go back again to try other stuff on their menu.

Very late at night around 1.30-1.45am down the line, we were driving past this place and came across this fine restaurant, one of the best late-night restaurants of the city right now. The mutton biriyani was just terrific and one of the best in the town right now, ¬†a such a good biriyani in a very unexpected place. The butter chicken was also very tasty but for a price of Rs. 300 around, the quantity was a little disappointing. The tandoor chicken was also very good, aptly charcoaled and smelled voraciously of butter. Well,all in all, it was a delight for the taste buds. The sitting arrangement was also decent enough and comfortable, and the music that was playing made the wait for food worth-while.

Finally a plan well executed and I had my dinner at Balle Balle Dhaba.

The start was with a wait of around 20 mins, because of the Saturday peak hours, but the comfortable sitting arrangement outside and nice music playing uninterruptedly made waiting not an issue.

Now I am not going to talk about the much praised decor and posters around the place but only one word for the ambience is Superb.

We ordered, Tandoori CHicken, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha, Mutton Boti Masala, Chicken Tadka, Masala Cold Drink and Kulfi.

The tandoor was the best thing I have had in a very long time, soft, smelled of butter, rightly charcoaled and had an awesome taste worth remembering.
Next came our Garlic Naan, Kulcha, Mutton Boti Masala and Chicken Tadka. The Boti Masala was another nice preparation, muttons were soft and shredded in red sauce went so well with our Kulcha and Naan. The Kulcha was good stuffed generously but I felt Garlic Naan could be improved, I could not smell the sweet aroma of garlic and butter, because I think it was served a little cold.
The Chicken Tadka was so full of shredded chicken and I loved it.¬†
The Kulfi was very average, perhaps I would not order it again on my next visit.¬†
Overall I came out a happy foodie !
Pocket Pinch: Rs 1009

Tried the Tandoori Chicken, Tawa Gosht and Chicken Bharta, Veg Jhal Farezi as well as a variety of breads (garlic naan, tandoori roti and kulcha). Loved all the food..especially the tandoori chicken which didn't have a bright red artificial color (a big plus). I usually don't eat mutton unless it's a minced kebab but the Tawa Gosht was really good! The meat was absolutely soft and not at all chewy. The breads were piping hot and perfect..especially the kulcha. Another plus was that the food doesn't sit too heavy in your stomach like most dhaba food.¬†
Only downside was the service. Not the waiters..the waiting time. It took quite long for food to arrive at the table so it might be a good idea to order all your food at once..rather than starters and then mains. Considering it's a dhaba, it should be quick service.¬†
All in all, definitely worth the money spent...loved the quality and taste of the food. Will definitely visit again!

Night 2am we drive past only to see this shop open and our hunger pangs made us take a U-turn to get some takeaways. Staying just 5mins walking I had never visited this place before. Ordered four biryanis only to be told they had just 2 plates left, it was 2am nobody can complain.¬†
So final order - 2 mutton biryani , butter chicken and rotis.

Biryani - little on the colder side but very tasty.
Roti - Piping hot and the best part is they were made of atta. Loved them. Could be eaten without and accompaniment
Butter chicken - have had this dish in maybe around 1000 places but must say it was very good. Though the quantity was less for a asking price of 295/- per plate but the taste made left us with no more complains.

This chic little place just near City centre 1 in salt lake will be my new often-to-be-gone places...

Balle Balle Dhaba is the newest addition to the already crowded Dhaba List of Kolkata. But in this short span, it has curved out a place of its own. Recently, I visited this place and Here is my take of various aspect of BBD :-



Location

--------------

They are extremely well located. Situated just beside the city center 1 in Salt Lake, they attract the mall hopping crowd and local people as well.



Ambiance

-----------------

BBD has decked up their indoor in a pure pujabi style. Bright, spacious and well planned indoor decoration with frames of different Punjabi legends, Santa Banta jokes, and various other things go well with the overall theme. Even the menu card is well crafted.



Food

--------

From the menu card, now lets move into the menu. It has all punjabi delicacies, almost all are quite familiar to the Punjabi food lovers. We ordered Butter Nun, Tandoori Roti and Chicken Lababdar. The butter nun was excellent with butter well spread out. Tandoori rotis were nice but not something remarkable. Chicken Lababdar had thick gravy which was spicy, oily but tasty as the same time. One can always expect punjabi foods to be high on calorie. So nothing to complain about really. The portion they serve was adequate for two of us.



Staff Behavior

---------------------

They deserve full marks in this section. The staffs were extremely cordial, polite and eager to help you around.

Service was quite prompt.



Pricing

-----------

One can feel a little pinch in the pocket as their pricing is on the higher side compared to other city dhabas. But still considering the portion they serve this pricing is acceptable.



Finally...

I always have a thing for the Punjabi cuisine and I have to say after a sumptuous lunch over there, my taste buds danced in the tune of Balle-Balle. We thoroughly enjoyed your offerings team BBD and we vow to come here again very soon.

Great ambience. Very tasty food. Very costly. Awesome. Me n dad thought of getting biriyani for home but saw some people eating butter naan n butter chicken n we went for the same. But while we were waiting for the order i went inside to check out the interiors and found a cosy and lovely ambience that you would bring your family or loved ones to. Great ambience.

The food we ordered was four butter naans and one butter chicken. Rs 532. Too costly dude! 

Coming to the quality: Pure awesomeness! Soft butter naan. Well spread butter. Only one piece was a little thick and not upto my expectations.
The butter chicken had shredded chicken and was tender and well-cooked. The presence of a small piece of cardamom made me happy. 

All in all a great place to go to! Highly recommended.

well once you enter the place u get the feel u have entered the "world of sardars".... from the decor to the food the place had a pinch of Punjab in it.... the food was yummy... we ordered chicken lababdar , dal amritsari.. fish amritsari and ¬†tandoori roti..... ¬†the dal amritsari was mouth watering .... awesome blend of all the dal and spices... the chicken was tender and the aroma was really appealing.. the fish amritsari was soft and spicy... if u like spicy food you will like it for sure.... the prices were pocket friendly.... the stuffs there were friendly and polite... they helped a lot in selecting the food... overall an excellent experience... a must visit..

Slightly congested, the ambience was the only reason stopping me from visiting the place but my friend seemed to want to go so we did and I am glad we did. The menu is simple, the staff is helpful. The food is good and served hot and promptly. We tried malai kofta, palak paneer and dal makhani. Dal was not impressive which is why I have not rated them higher. The rest was pretty good and very generous portions. One curry is enough for two easily. Liked their lassi too :)

Food is good. Decor and ambience are really nice, especially the pictures of Jagjit Singh, Reshma ji, Wadali Brothers, Gurdass Mann, Sunny Deol, Yuvraj Singh, Milkha Singh, Daler Mehndi, Master Saleem i.e. All the stalwarts with their roots deep in Punjab...though the menu is certainly overpriced. They even charge a ridiculous Service Charge and then expect a tip. Very less parking space. Gets overcrowded after 9-00 pm. Can't give more than 3 marks!

Yesterday being a Sunday, rainy-day and post-exam day landed me up at this joint. Punjabi cuisine has always been close to my heart and Balle balle oozes out 'punjabiness' right from its name. The decor has to be described in one word: awesome. I simply loved it. From Santa-Banta jokes to framed eminent personalities, it replicated well a typical Punjabi household, which has too many framed wall embellishments.

Being a weekend, it was pretty packed up. We were lucky that as we entered we got a table. The service was prompt. Amazing! So full but yet, so fast...

Okay, so we ordered Mutton Boti Kebab, Kashmiri Pulao, Butter Naan, Malai Kofta, Mutton Shahi Korma, Coke and Kulfis. The bill came up to 1.4 k, which was fine for the three of us.

The starter Boti Kebab was amazing. It was so spicy, soft and melted in the mouth. It tasted so flavorful with the slice of lime. The naans were soft with ample amount of butter. But the Shahi Korma was simply mind blowing. Malai Kofta gravy tasted okayish , although the Koftas were prepared well n Kashmiri pulao was actually Mix Veg Pulao. The Kulfis at the end was perfect icing on the cake. It was so creamy. So, all in all,great food.

Being a resident of Alipore, its madness to drive down to salt lake for dinner, but the food & ambience of Balle Balle Dhaba, Salt Lake has made us come to dine out here for 5th time in the last 3 months. I got introduced to this place through my sardar friends, & its worth coming again & again. The ambience of this place, nice music they play, wonderful kababs they make, delicious kulchas & parathas they serve, & the phirni & lassi....Chak de real Punjabi food......truly they are the best in kolkata in terms of Punjabi food. I have been eating out at so many places, this Balle Balle Dhaba is a true gift to all punjabi food lovers. 
This guys serve quality foo, with a wonderful open kitchen which speaks loud on hygiene, & wonderful ambience........& the best part its open till 2am.....I will keep coming back balle balle....u guys rock!!!

Balle Balle dhaba is the newest addition to the mushrooming restaurants in the salt lake area serving North Indian fare. 
Located conveniently near City Center 1, a visit was on the cards as it is located near my office. 

My friend and I made an impromptu plan to try it out on a weekday for an early dinner. It is not a very huge place and I feel that the tables are a bit cramped. There is seating for around 30-40 people inside and a couple of tables outside as well. The kitchen is visible through a glass pane which has become a fashion nowadays. 
We immediately got a seat as we entered and ordered for a lassi, a fresh lime soda, green salad and a chicken pahari kebab on the waiter's suggestion. The interiors are bright and the walls and ceiling is embellished by uncountable number of posters promoting Punjabi culture. You will find anything and everything relating to Punjabi heritage, starting from Maharaja Ranjit SIngh to Singh Saab the great (Sunny Deol movie) poster. It seemed a bit cluttered and overdone to me. 

Coming back to the real deal, the drinks were served in a few minutes and the kebab arrived in ten minutes. The lassi was thick and good. The fresh lime soda was not upto the mark. It tasted like lime water with a hint of lime and totally lacked the zing. 
The kebab tasted good but not spectacular as I was expecting after going through the positive reviews. It was a bit salty for my taste, but the chicken was soft and fresh. Next we wanted to try the Mutton Galouti kebab but sadly it was not available so we settled for a simple Chicken tikka kebab. The dish was served within 5-7minutes hot and fresh. I liked this preparation more as it was soft, succulent and piping hot. 
We were almost full after consuming two plates of kebab and a plate of green salad so we gave the main course a miss and ordered for a phirni. The phirni tasted really well. The stuff was chilled and very well made with a beautiful aroma. 

Overall a pretty decent experience, however the quantity is not satisfactory as each plate of kebabs consist of 5 pieces compared to the standard serving quantity of 6 pieces at most restaurants. Prices are not cheap and quite at par with the market standards. For all the food that we consumed, the bill was around Rs 750 which is okay. I might visit again for the main course items

Location: Near to City Centre 1, Saltlake. 

This place has been on my wishlist for long now and finally made it till here for a family dinner. 
The ambiance was quite good but the place being a cramped one, felt even more hemmed in due to the high number of framed posters all over the place. The visible tandoor section was a plus (atleast for me).

After contemplating, we ordered for the following: 

- Dahi Kebab 
Tasted good. Was soft from inside and crisp from the outside. 
The stuffing was delicious and melted in the mouth.
The condiment (mint chutney) along was generously served.

- Dal Makhani 
Had a completely different taste to it, but was delicious. The black lentils were perfectly cooked. 
Highly recommended.

- Dal Tadka
Black lentils simmered overnight and cooked in the right balance of spices. Tasted good.

- Navratan Korma
Visually was different from the usual one, was yellowish in color. But, tasted great.

- Kashmiri Aloo Dum 
Did not quite suit my palate. Was an average dish. The potatoes weren't boiled properly and the gravy lacked the required flavours. Have had better.

- Malai Kofta 
The Koftas were delicious. The gravy was well prepared. 
Recommended. 

- Veg Jhalfarezi
The veggies were fresh and juicy and the dish was flavorful.
Just the way the server had described it. Happy.

- Butter Naan 
Was soft and was served with a slight brush of butter. Tasted good.

- Masala Kulcha
Was thick and was filled with a flavorful potato stuffing. Good to taste.

- Garlic Naan
The bread was thin and crisp with the right amount of garlic on top. Was served with a slight brush of butter.
Recommended.

- Tandoori Roti 
Had wished for a crisp one and yes, it was served as expected.

- Lassi 
The lassi was amazing. It was thick and had the right amount of sweetness. 
A great drink which helped flush down the whole meal!
Recommended.

The staff was segregated with the help of different uniforms for the servers and runners. Impressive.
The server was courteous enough to guide us through the ordering process.
The service was a bit slow and lacked the efficiency to manage a huge crowd.
-Being a newly opened restaurant I hope they bring about improvements in their service.

Prices are reasonable enough, not too steep.

Overall a good experience.
-Revisiting soon!

This place has amazing decor ,with framed pics of famous punjabi ppl,jokes etc.quite well lit up too!

We had ordered fish tikka and lasuni kebab in starters.The fish melted in my,mouth and had the right,blend of spices,nt too spicy but enough to tickle ur tastebuds.The lasuni kebab was very juicy and had a diffrnt flavor,quite liked it.

For the main course.We ordered balle balle chkn,n kali daal wid breads.
The chickn ws a diffrnt version of chkn bharta,bt it had too little spice for my liking,very light flavour.
The daal was creamy and thick,really good.

I would recommend this place for anyone looking for the dhaba like punjabi cuisine though the prices are not exactly dhaba like!
Onli downside i felt was that the place is vry cramped up,vry little free space to move around.

For a person like me who gets ecstatic on having kebabs and North Indian cuisine, having something like Balle Balle Bhaba at a walking distance from home is a blessing.

This time I went with dad and opted for takeaway. They asked us to wait in the outside seating area while they prepared the food.
Interiors are nicely decorated with framed posters of many bollywood movies. Maybe it looked a little cramped but the overall experience says that this aspect may be easily ignored.

Starting with the kebabs, the Fish Amritsari Kebab and Chicken Lasuni Kebab were soft, succulent and sprinkled with the right amount of spice.
Perfect.

Next, I went ahead with the Tandoori roti along with Chicken Bharta and Dal Makhani. Dad went for Masala Kulcha and Shahi Paneer. The flavor of the dal deserves special mention. Another good part is that none of the dishes had that huge layer of oil you often get at other dhabas. Thumbs up again!

The portions were generous and we got full value for the money. (Meal for 5 came at around 1900 bucks)

The food was great and we are definitely looking forward to visit this place again very soon.

This is the cool new place to eat. It is bang opposite City Center 1, very easy to locate, with an interesting facade - pretty inviting to the eyes. And may I add, very pleasing interiors - shiny, kitschy, fun! It has all Bollywood movie posters framed and thronged over the walls and ceilings, quirky furniture, which really make the place curiously interesting.
Now about the food. They have a one page no-nonsense menu mainly comprising Indian non-veg food, very competitively priced. I ordered for a plate of Chicken Biryani, Mutton Boti Kebab, Butter Naan (2), Tandoori Roti (3), Chicken Bharta, and Chicken Ra Ra Punjabi - all of this for a neat 1200 bucks. The portion size was also damn decent - will easily suffice for 2 moderately big eaters.
The Biryani was lightly flavorful, and the meat was tender. The quality of the breads were amazing, I have to admit, because we had kept them for long before actually eating them, and they were still chewy and soft. The Kebab was succulent and there was no raw meat smell like it so often happens with mutton kebabs. Nice!
Chicken Bharta was up to the mark, nothing to complain about. But the Ra Ra Chicken was absolutely fabulous - spicy but not too heavy, sweet but rightly balanced. I must add that two things made me very happy. One, the condiments were neatly and generously served. Two, the aftermath was good. No gassy, burpy feel to it. It proves that the restaurant pays attention to quality and service. Highly recommended! Kudos! Keep up the good work!

Good ambience, pocket-friendly....good food. Service is not upto the mark. The staff are most of the time busy watching tv or lethargic, leading to slow serving of food. The Pahari kebab was good...though not the best. The place can be better and might look forward to visiting it again.

Me and my friends were hanging out in city center in the evening and suddenly we had this great urge to eat someplace nice. Suddenly we came up with the idea of visiting this joint because this restaurant looked do appealing to us. Once we entered this place we were immediately lit up because of their decor. It was not a huge place but the way they arranged everything and the concept and the decor was really something that can be enjoyed along with their food. As we were not really hungry we just ordered tandoori chicken, galouti kebab( which they did not have so we changed our order to chicken pahari kabab), fresh lime sodas, kulfi and firni. Firstly the pahari kebab was really succulent and tasty and alas the plate became empty in a jiffy. the tandoori chicken was also good and nothing to complain about and the fresh lime sodas were also perfectly done according to our instructions. The kulfis were small in portions and as am not a big fan of kulfis i did not really like it and again the price was more in comparison to the portion. i loved the firni as it was perfect be it the smell, the taste, the portion everything was in sync. I would definitely say that we all had a good experience and i would definitely go back to try out their main dishes.

The decor is fabulous and it is exactly like a dhaba feel with air conditioning which makes it blissful in Kolkata, considering the weather. The interiors are done up really well and the whole place has a feel good factor to it.  The waiters are courteous and quite attentive. We ordered Lasuni Chicken kebab, Butter Chicken-boneless, Garlic naan, tandoori rotis and of course the classic dal tadka & how could I forget the lassi.
The food came pretty fast and the kebabs were so soft and tender that they disappeared as soon as they were served. The butter chicken was rich and the gravy was simply excellent, the dal tadka had generous amounts of ghee on it and was simply thick and yummy. The naan was soft and buttery and the roti was perfectly made. The lassi was thick and over all the meal was fulfilling and satisfying. This is an excellent choice for a quick dhaba style meal and swesome food at decent prices. Meal for two with tax came to 1026.
I would highly recommend this to those who love good Indian food the classic dhaba way!!!

We ordered Sweet lassi & fresh lime soda, had chicken reshmi & tikka kebab for starters, they reshmi kebab was a bit dry but tikka kebab was moist & succulent. for the main course we had panner pulao, butter naan, malai kofta & chicken bharta everthing was superb specially the kofta. in deserts we had kulfi the amount they gave was too little & should have been served in a bowl! Overall it was good experience & the service was prompt.

Balle Balle Dhaba was no Balle Balle at all. The Service was horrible. We were made to wait like hell and they did not even  bother to check on us. The tables were lying vacant but they did not bother to clear it up until we requested them to. The management and the staff were not hospitable at all and lacked basic courtesy. It's better to eat at Langaar then to eat at Balle Balle Dhaba.I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.

I was actually quite dismayed after I saw the overwhelming number of framed photographs that made this already cramped-looking joint look even more claustrophobic to me. The food was good, from whatever I tasted of it, though. 

Between the three of us, we managed to order a few things - soft Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan, Tandoori Rotis were accompanying Dal Makhani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Kadai Paneer. We also picked a couple of Kababs - Chicken Reshmi kabab and Chicken Pahari Kabab. I asked for a glass of lassi and it was thick and delicious. My friend ordered coke, and got them in a glass. I wish they would add a couple of ice cubes to the lassi though. 

The Dal Makhani was quite good... the kababs were nice, but not overwhelmingly so - I found them tougher than I like them to be. The Tikka masala was all right, and the Kadai Paneer was actually quite good. Bill for the three of us came to just over 1700/- which I personally felt was all right, if a tad on the higher side, especially since our meal value was around 1400/- (so nearly 300/- on taxes I am assuming). We got a handwritten bill because the cash register wasn't working apparently. Service was brisk and good.

If you're near City Centre, stop by Balle Balle Dhaba for an inexpensive, casual meal. We started with ‚ÄòChicken Pahari Kabab‚Äô and just love the taste which was freshly made from tandoor. Fresh Lime Soda was little off the taste which surprises me. For main course we went for ‚ÄòButter Chicken‚Äô, ‚ÄòPaneer Pulao‚Äô, ‚ÄòMalai Kofta‚Äô & ‚ÄòMasala Kulcha‚Äô. We like our Kulcha to be made crisp and Balle Balle Dhaba was one of the few places where we actually get it the way we like it. The Butter Chicken was spicy and flavoursome with a full on use of spices. Great flavours and I liked the texture of the chicken and the portion size was just right for two. Paneer Pulao tasted very average but Malai Kofta tasted delicious, perfectly cooked. The Butter Chicken and Malai Kofta were couple of our favourite dishes on the menu. The prices of the dishes were very reasonable. For the taste of the food and the efficiency of the service, Balle Balle Dhaba should definitely be a regular joint for all the North Indian food aficionados who live or work in and around the City Centre area. For desserts we opted ‚ÄòFirni‚Äô & it was real thick and super sweet. Great for dessert but slightly too light for me to wash down my meal with.

Went there yesterday for lunch with my sister and her friend and what can i say,we would have regretted it if we wouldn't have gone.It's not like any other Dhaba in salt lake,but it's quite better.I,personally couldn't have asked for more.The ambiance was rather lovely.We ordered Plain Basmati Rice,Yellow Dal,Butter Chicken,and Garlic Naan. Lassi was ordered as a beverage.Each and every dish was exquisite.The lassi was a bit thick than usual,but that can easily be overlooked.The price was very reasonable for the finesse they were providing.A minor disappointment was that they had run out of ice cream in this scorching heat but they did have kulfi and that was very well set. Phirni was also ordered as a dessert and how could that be a fail. They highly impressed me by the haphazard poster art. They have impressed me to my core.I will be back in Balle Balle soon,HUNGRY FOR MORE!!!!!!

The best thing about this place is its location, just beside CC1. but if comes to food n management, nothing special. the ambience is good. the service is ok, but is not effective enough to handle large crowd. i tried tikka n lasuni kebab. both of them were over grilled. it's not prescribable. the biriyani is good in quantity n ok in quality. a lot of improvement is needed as a whole...

( Edit ) : +.5 after my recent experience. Visited this place again and guess what, the experience was better than the last one. My friend ordered Tandoori Chicken: The pieces were a bit smaller than served at other restaurants but they tasted good according to his review. We also ordered Malai Kofta and Masala Coldrinks.
The Malai kofta was a bit sweet in taste and needed trace amount of salt. I must say that the kofta balls were cooked well thus maintaining the texture and the softness of the Kofta. Masala colddrink is now a common drink known in every household and very easy to prepare. Summing up, it was a satisfactory experience.
As usual the d√©cor consisting of photos depicting the "The Singhs" from all professions throughout the world add an X factor to this place.¬†

P.s. : I feel that the food is a bit costly at this place. Rs. 740 for two people is a bit overpriced.
Pros:
Good non veg Punjabi platters 
Good ambience and decor
Awesome phirni
Cons:
Not many veg options
Less spacious
2.75 for food and .25 for decor 
P.s.-needs improvement

Eating out after almost a month is indeed very alluring. It makes me ecstatic :D
Now it is not an astounding piece of news for a north calcuttan to go and hangout at City Centre, one of the most preferred malls in Kolkata.
It was one such evening, where P and I were near CC and with hunger in our tummy and pictures of food in our eyes walked towards the mall and froze while entering because I noticed this really jived and lively place called Balle Balle Dhaba right next to Cc.
Now it is improbable that I'll leave out North indian food for anything else. So, the decision was made and we hit Balle Balle Dhaba almost immediately.
The inside is a very hippy, lively and bright picture. Very dhaba like with chairs and tables, the light bulbs and the trillions of pictures that adorn the walls of this place, this is a real catch. This exudes the feel of a dhaba almost immediately, though a bit posh however, this place is just BEAUTIFUL.
Quirky quotes and pictures on the wall, they also have a live kitchen which adds to their brownie points.

Coming down to the menu, the order was simple and clipped.

Masala Coke
Chicken Reshmi Kebab
Garlic Naan
Chicken Tadka

The coke came in first as we seated ourselves very comfortably and looked about. The ambience will definitely light you up.
Tip : Go after a break up perhaps? :P

Next came in the kebabs. And booom!
They were one of the most succulent, juiciest and soft kebabs I'd ever tried. It was just perfect with the proper seasoning and the right amount of charred smell.
They were delicious. We paused to decided if we should almost have a dinner over here and my nostrils flared up and I ordered us the dinner.

The garlic naan and chicken tadka came in soon.  Haye kya batau mainu?! I was overwhelmed with the sight.
Anyway, we dug into the food almost immediately. It was orgasmic. Pardon my words :D
The garlic naan and the chicken tadka was just so good. I kept licking my fingers over and over again. And guess what ? My friend P is a punjabi xD
The chicken tadka was smooth and tasty and went amazingly well with the naan.
The garlic naan was soft and fresh and smelt heaven.
 *Pats back in happiness*
My dearest punjaban kept complaining "Oye kake, mainu chef se milade zara!" He loved the food as much as I did.
I would definitely and i do mean definitely go back to sample more of their menu. These people look very promising :)

Service is a little slack but I do hope they improve soon enough.

PS : Cost for two - INR 800/-

"Chak de phatte, nap de killi
Raat nu jalandhar, sawere dilli!"

Cheers!

Balle Balle Dhaba is located just opposite to petrol pump near City Center. This place was earlier occupied by salt & pepper.
The restaurant looks very nice from outside with outdoor seating arrangement as well. Colours are soothing to eyes and decor is quite impressive. The ceiling is little low and makes the restaurant look really small with little walking space between tables.
I went there with two of my friends. One of them was in hurry, so we ordered dal makhni, chana masala, garlic naan, kulcha and butter roti. Service was quick as the food arrived in time. Dal makhni and chana masala were fabulous but naan was little chewy and stretchy. Apart from that every thing was good. 
One advice for them is to make a take away counter outside restaurant as people for take away wait inside and make this small eatery house look very clumsy.

Balle Balle... it's time to celebrate because at last Kolkata has got a joint which has the look & feel of a typical Punjabi restaurant and authentic taste of North Indian food. This place sells amazing kababs. The lasuni kabab is a must try here. The biryani is also succulent and tasty. All the other dishes are very authentic and tasty too including dal makhani, chicken bharta. A must visit place when you are at Salt Lake especially City Centre. The restaurant still needs to improve in a few aspects but if you are a foodie then this is the place to be to gorge on some yummy food.

Ok so this is one of the newest entrants into the salt lake area which looked really promising from the outside sadly doesnt really deliver the goods.

The first thing i want to point out is that this place is extremely cramped for space. There is just no space. Ok top of that there are hoards of people standing inside for take aways and that just adds to the chaos. Ac condition is sub par for the kind of rush inside. I should have chosen to sit outside and even in this heat it wud have been cooler outside. Service was very very very slow. Under staffed i presume on weekends!!! 

The food was thankfully not as disappointing. The starters were really well done although majority of the items are currently unavailable. Main course was decent. Breads were disappointing though .. Some very v hard others were  undercooked! Deserts are currently unavailable too. 

I wud suggest that this place is best avoided during weekends. I assume the experience would be far better on weekdays.

The area in and around City Centre I has around fifty plus eating outlets and still this is the first dhaba style restaurant that was long pending to appear on the food map of that region! Caf√©s, delis, pizza joints, fine diners, roadside delicacies, cake shops, food counters selling assortment of food items (hot dog, pasta, fries, roll), ice golas, tea cafes, ice cream parlours, you name it and it was there. Only thing missing from the scene was a decent dhaba style restaurant.

Tired shoppers, especially the ones with children will definitely welcome this eatery with a sign of relief. Primarily, because they look forward to comfort seating, home style food, quick service and not high billing. And since this eatery functions till 2am, it will also be a boon to the late night cine goers, who were earlier required to travel to at least till Sec V to avail their midnight comfort food.

For some reason, the restaurant‚Äôs signboard reminds you of a kid‚Äôs birthday party. Some seating arrangements are designed for open air. But most of the seating is inside the A/c restaurant. The area inside is rather small and it has an open kitchen. Design concept is economical, smart and different. All the walls, as well as the ceiling is covered with multi sized but unanimously styled photo frames, containing an assortment of photos of Punjabi flavor, like those of ‚Äì actors, movies, sportsmen, singers, comic strips, temples etc. One small LED TV screen is also present. When we visited, the screen was in pause mode, and the audio was tuned for ‚Äòaarti‚Äô. Dining tables are wooden and each table top is painted like the walls in the villages of the north-west region. Also, each of these tables is painted differently. Benches are wooden and chairs are made of wrought iron. Again, each of these chairs is colored  differently. All in all, it‚Äôs an interesting d√©cor.

Waiters are clad in jeans. They are courteous but not very trained. Serving is fast. Food is authentic but very oily. Also, all the items in the menu are not currently available.
