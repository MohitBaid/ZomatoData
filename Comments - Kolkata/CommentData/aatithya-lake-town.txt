With all due respect to my fellow foodies I don't get why this place has such a low rating! Ordered food from this place tonight for two people...can't say much about the ambience but their home delivery service is really good as they were right on time like they said with hot dinner ready to be served. We ordered "crispy baby corn" "egg chicken fried rice" and " garlic chicken" The quantity of food is quite filling and taste was really good. Special mention goes to garlic chicken as it had an unique taste not like any other garlic chicken I had. Really happy about this place and ordering some more food soon. My only question is why on earth did they send a bill with the name "melting pot" on it (refer pic)

Ordered Chilli Chicken from this place. The chicken pieces are considerably large in size. It came with a lot of gravy. So that's a plis point according to me. The spice factor was a tad bit on the higher side though. Kinda on the expensive side I'd say.

Never knew about this place and I live at Dumdum. 
Decent place, seat back, relax- don't rush since the service is quite slow. 
Had crispy fried chicken with sweet sauce. Tested okay. 
Plus point-they don't need Air Conditioning.

this was my second visit..first time..went with friends..the food was okay..but definitely as told by other users here..liked their outdoor seating arena..it was pleasing..however..today after work..thot of just havin a cuppa as i was full and was even thinkin to make it a regular hangout for tht quiet cuppa in the evenins..strangely..wen i asked for the bill..they told..you can't just have a coffee and need to order some food as well (p.s. the place was absolutely  empty)..i politely said No as i wasnt hungry and only came for a hot coffee and some quiet time amidst the hustle bustle of lake town..but tht owner had his own whimsical attitude..insisting me abt their age old rules and blah..i objected..saying..ur waiter shud hv informed me and since ur takin 30 odd bucks for a plain small cup of coffee it explains that you're adding up ur ambience and sitting charges as well and if at all ur not satisfied u can always add up ur s.c, s.t etc..but forcibly asking ur customer to make a higher bill even if he is not tht hungry is equal to loosing a potential nearby customer and surely affecting ur so called concept..
a strict dislike from me and my folks..as an adamant and sick attitude never gets a shelf life..if u want to play so safe better open a pan shop..

What a discovery! Not a fine dining restaurant but no less with an open sitting, prompt service, smiling and helpful staff and whao at what prices.... I had 2 veg dishes, rice and a bottle of bottled water; all for a princely Rs 145. Great value for money for GOOD food. Can't get better. Coming from Delhi NCR, unbelievable.

We ordered : Chicken egg Hakka Noodles and Chili fish.
Noodles was nicely made with good amount of egg and chicken pieces.
Fish was bit hard. but the gravy was tasty.Overall it was a good experience.

This Restaurant Is Very Well-Maintained and Staff were also good behaved and the prices are also pocket friendly.......

It's a small decent place on the road parallel to Lake town main road. We've been ordering food from here since ages and it has come to the point where we just say our name...no address required. Chinese chicken salad is one of our favorites and other Chinese starters such as crispy fried baby corn, crispy chicken, chilli garlic pepper chicken are very good. The noodles are tasty enough for a day when you just don't want to have home food. Hot garlic chicken is really tasty. And the best part is that you get Bengali food which tastes like home made food. The mocha r torkari is one of my favorites with Rui maach er kalia a close contender. All said and done, this place is our saviour when we just don't want to cook.

This small joint is near Lake town 3rd lake.A small place to start with they even have a outdoor portion with dim light to enjoy in evening for a nice ambience.Coming to food I have been to this place twice in my life time once with my office colleague we ordered their Chicken momo & in the mean time was deciding about the main course but the service was so poor that the food didn't show up for 1 hour, being asked the waiter said they ran out of the momo & ours were being made from scratch.so we waited for more 1/2 hour had our so awaited momo & left cause we relay didn't had the patient for waiting any more, the second time was on a party thrown by my friend on his anniversary.but still the service remain the same and the food was just ok. We ordered their mix rice and chilli chicken it was ok ok. Some of my friend ordered plain rice with mutton which needed to be cooked a little bit more. So over all try it if you got no option left.

Located near lake town swimming pool, this will look alluring to a passerby. There's an indoor and an outdoor seating arrangement. The outdoor decor is good, with Chinese lanterns and lots of plants. Food is mediocre. I used to go there a lot as a student, mostly because of the
 inexpensive menu. Service is not very speedy though, and the food nothing worth writing home about. The fish finger and momos are good. The soups are so-so, but the rice and noodles are really disappointing. The chicken dishes are not worth a try- mostly overcooked and over-the-top spicy. The place could be a lot cleaner; the open washroom and brooms and buckets lying about sort of killed the mood. Not to mention the overabundance of mosquitoes.

A close friend of mine wanted to take me to this place right since I met her. And finally we went there last month. 

The ambiance has a homely feel. The sitting area is divided into two parts; one inside a room and the other in an open space. The open space is  lined up with potted plants. Rusted utensils hang on the walls as part of decoration.

We ordered chicken pan fried momo as my friend said its the best thing in their menu. She wasn't very wrong I believe. They served 5  big momos tossed in a spicy tangy sauce . It was delicious and very filling.

Next we ordered schezwan chicken noodles. It was okay in taste. 

One can simply come back here for the pan fried momo. Prices are good on the pockets.

Okay... On nabami nishith... Me and my best friend went to this place... They say on zomato that its airconditioned but its actually not... Eta basically ekta khorer kutir type er... My friend dint want to go to this place but I kinda forced him because zomato has always been very helpful for me.
But this time... Noh not dat good.
The place is just okayish...
Not well lit at all. :( 
We ordered for fried rice and some manchurian chicken.
The preparation was not that bad... But the chicken was hard... And I sort of hated it.
The only thing is that the price is cheap.

Well I can only say I would have been happy to pay more if the food was better.
:( disappointed

The decor was quite nice, cool & dimly lift! Ordered the barbeque chicken for starters and mixed heavy noodles. 
The chicken was okay, lacked the tenderness, over fried. Then the noodles. First, they served the Hakka noodles, which was returned! Then, they served the gravy noodles after sometime. The quality was far from acceptable. The mixed noodles had tonnes of cabbage, which was horrible and there was very much less chicken! Would definitely not recommend this eatery!

I am coming to this place for almost 6 years now and the reason i keep coming back to this place over and over is the ambiance and location. Food is just about average here with excess of sause in almost all chinese dishes and not much difference in their preparations. The indian snacks are little better than their chinese counterparts....but overall quality lacks to impress. Price is reasonably low as compared to the location, you can give this a try if you want some average food at low cost. I will just add that you may not get all the things in the menu...for some strange reasons

Meeting old friends makes life worth living for and the journey down the memory lane only gets longer when accompanied with a leisurely dinner. As our friends cared to visit us in Kolkata, we planned to outsource the dinner. While looking for home delivery options in the neighbourhood, reviews in Zomato made us choose Atithya from Lake Town. We ordered two portions of pan fried chilli chicken as starters and three portions of chicken kasha (chicken cooked in thick spicy gravy). The food was delivered well within 30 minutes and it cost us Rs.645/-. Sadly enough, the restaurant's menu does not include rotis, which we had to source from somewhere else. The food was well prepared and enjoyed by all. Atithya does serve the genre of Bengali food, which I would be eager to try for lunch someday.

Update

Changed the chef, the waiter, the decor. Everything. And the food has worsened like anything. The momos are so generously oily and loose that you'll feel like drying them with a tissue before taking a bite.

Bang opposite to my place in Lake Town, my association with this restaurant dates back to as early as the year 2004. Over the years this restaurant has maintained an excellent standard considering its location and the kind of the people it caters to.  
The Chinese food is good for the price and you have a variety of options to choose from. The bengali food which I occasionally get for lunch is decent enough.  

In all this restaurant's quality and service has been exceptional considering it is typically a local 'para' restaurant in Kolkata.

Aatithya is not a very well recognised restaurant situated at the corner of lake town park with indoor and outdoor dine in and home delivery facility. We used be a regular guest of that place at our college days and our all time order was Chicken lolypop and Chicken soup. I tell you the taste is remarkable..
Yes may be the service is slow and the crowd is basically couples who come by the adjacent park but never mind its their call. Even the Veg manchurians they serve are my fav ! I just die for them.. so good preparation. Momos are also very nice.. 

If you want to have good Chinese food, this place is a must visit. recommended by me. :)

There is both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements here so you can choose according to your need and mood. The theme is very Bong and all kinds of food is served here. I remember going here initially for their tasty momos which are the same till date. The spring rolls are also good and can be tried if you want an evening snack. The chinese dishes are equally good and tasty. I tried their non veg thali in the afternoon several times and i must say they did not disappoint me here too. All over a nice quiet place to spend an evening in the locality with your family and friends. They also rent out the place for small birthday parties.. so next time you can try this place for your small party. The prices are reasonable enough and wont pinch you for sure.

A friend suggested this place, so we decided to check it out. It was a delightful experience. Such good food at low prices. Barbeque chicken and pan fried chicken are a must try. The decor is nice as well. The waiters are humble and polite. They even have an outdoor sitting area. Also food prices are tax inclusive.

The most unprofessional type of restaurant I have ever come across.  Its alluring for any passersby to enter this restaurant,  given the quality to interiors they have maintained. Its indeed a couples corner but a strict no no for authentic foodies.
The food- whatever you order for tastes absolutely blunt and tasteless. Moreover, you are greeted with hundreds of mosquitoes while you take ur meal. The service is slow and lathergic. Its a strict no for anyone when Wing Wah, an authentic Chinese Restaurant is in neighborhood. Aatitha is sustaining for maintaining the beautiful couple corner which attracts couples from the adjoining park.
My review comes from my repeated visits. I m a localite of Lake Town and visited this restaurant on multiple occasssions only to face a bitter experience.

not at all good. i have been coming here from the past two years. the quality of food has been going down and the prices are going up. the quality of fried rice and chilly chicken is awful and leaves u with a bad feeling. the momos save the place but not a good place to spend money

If you are passing by the Lake Town Park, B Block, hungry and tired... wait. What's that right where the park ends? At first glance, it may look like an ordinary store selling soft drinks, but if you see the board and it says "Atithya" then you've found a treasure chest. I've been to this place with a good friend and I'll always remember this place for the ambiance it offers. They should seriously consider replacing the name board that advertises a soft drink brand rather than highlighting the name of this place. If you don't live in Lake Town or not a frequent visitor of this place, it will be a little difficult for you to locate this restaurant. I can't exactly explain why, but there is something special and homely feeling about the location and tidiness of this place.

Their Drums of Heaven and Red Pepper Prawn are pretty good. Within 500-600 two people can eat a lot here. Food quality is good and quite inexpensive. This is an ideal place to visit with small group of friends. If you visit in the afternoon, go to the park after you finish eating. Take a walk or sit by the lake. You won't regret.

Aatithya is a good enough place to have a Bengali thali (or ghoroa khabar). The prices are decent, the quantity served is sufficient and the restaurant is neat. What works for the restaurant apart from the good quality food is the ambiance. Though it looks a bit shabby from outside and is sometimes really difficult to locate, the place has it's own homely charm. 
A place to be frequently visited from childhood (a result of the cook taking uninformed leaves)....this tiny spot has always been pretty consistent so far. Well done, Aatithya!

Although located very near to the VIP road, it is very difficult to locate if you are not a resident of the Lake Town & adjoining areas. It's a very small but tidy restaurant and serves pretty decent food, especially the momos. Actually, it is a very cool place to hangout with a small group of friends - the ambience is nice, and is definitely recommended if you are around the area, and would like to spend some time over tea/coffee and little somethings!
