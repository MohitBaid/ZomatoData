I have tried their chicken roll and the roll was very average.. the paratha is not well cooked and the staffing is also very less 2 pieces of chicken only.. they does not use any separate masala for roll..only regular sauce (not ketchup)

This place is really bad. The food is terrible. It tastes really bad. Half the time it is stale. Also it is very unhygienic. I found a cockroach looming around my plate and my appetite was lost. I would never visit this place again.
