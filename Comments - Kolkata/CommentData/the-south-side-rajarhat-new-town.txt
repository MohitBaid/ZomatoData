I ordered one masala dosa(50/) , one plate chicken momo(50/) and two plate egg noodles(50/+50/). Dosa was too good and the momo was just awesome, the chatni and soup(with small chicken pieces ) was too good. Quantity of noodles was too enough .The service was fast.👍👌👌👌

Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Ambience: 3/5

The biggest plus point of this restaurant is that it is VALUE FOR MONEY. I ordered Chicken 65 and Chilly Chicken. Chicken 65 was awesome(we were fighting over the remaining dry gravy after all the chicken pieces got exhausted). Chilly Chicken was fine, nothing great. But both are priced INR80(6 pieces). 
The guy who owns the restaurant knows how to woo customers. Impeccable service and prompt food delivery. They are really courteous and will make you feel special once you are at their restaurant.
They need to work on the decor. But that can be pardoned keeping in mind that the restaurant has just opened a few months back. Bottom-line...don't try to impress your special one at the restaurant...rather order at home and enjoy the food. :)
Overall a good experience. Will order again....soon.
