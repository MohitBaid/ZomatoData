Since we are writing a review on Lakshmi Puja, may Goddess Lakshmi bless all the foodies! :) Kolkata Kitchen is just near home, it's a small, pure vegetarian restaurant on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

We went there to get some food packed for home today. Almost everything on the menu was available. We ordered thalis, idlis and aloo paranthas. The restaurant is quite small and can accommodate only 5-6 people at a time so it's advisable to avoid going there to have meals in a big group. The interior is neat with high stools, AC and mirrors.

The order was packed for us in 30 min and the packaging was neatly done. The food was warm and fresh, the prices are a little high for such a small restaurant, but the food was quite filling and we couldn't complain.

The rotis in veg thali were soft, the dum aloo had mild spices, we loved it. The idlis were quite big in size and tasted good but could be softer. The dal and sambhar were runny but not that bland. The aloo parantha was good as well and there was a small packet of pickle to go with it. Overall, it's a good place to order lunch for bachelors or a family of 3-4 under Rs. 500
Pocket pinch for 4 of us- INR 350

I've had many a meal from here. The food is good enough for the price. If you're on a string budget, do check out the place. It might be worth the time.

Ordered via swiggy-peas pulao, butter panerr masala, veg tarka. Tarka was good and had a dhaba style taste. Peas pulao was also nice and aromatic. Paneer was just ok ok not that great. But the best thing i got was value for money.

I ordered Chhole Bhatore and to my surprise, a plate of two parathas and a small amount of choole cost INR.50. That's insane!! You can get a lot better food with 50 rupees. Quality is also pathetic.

Ordered Dal Makhani, Palan Paneer and Paneer Butter Masala through Swiggy.

No Butter in Dal Makhani, just boiled, like veg tarka.
100% Tasteless.

Also given in 250ml tiny bowl which used to be half a plate quantity.

Rest 2 items also tasteless and very small in quantity.

Totally waste of money.

I'm generally a B'fast buyer on Home Del. thru Swiggy . Truly their Idlis were warm & very soft & tasty too. Once I tried Aloo Paratha (2) & Masala Aloo Dum . They were just good & eatables, but Aloo Paratha was very thick on the edge like mound of Wheat. Aloo stuffing had no Corriander leaf finely chopped & Roasted Jeera Powder etc. But what they've served me just eatable. I hope their is ignoring it & surely they can do it at no extra cost. Overall I'll go for their more Veg. items & try. Pls. go for their food & give your feedback, its good for us both.
