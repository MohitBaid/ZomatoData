Not sufficient for an individual. Should increase quantity if this price range is maintained

It was an okay experience here. I'd ordered last minute to fulfil my pomfret fish cravings. But I wasn't happy with the taste. We had the masala one and the mustard one and I hope they work on making it better.

Good food.. new themed restaurant in town...  Visit this place last Sunday.. Enjoy what they had to offer for veg...  My friends who accompanied me enjoyed the fish Patti with the dhakai style pulao.. a must visit place to have a gastronomic blast.

Good authentic Bengali food, enjoyed the fish, in fact it was one of the best fish curry I had in recent time. 
Service was too up to the mark

First visit to a 14 days old restaurant,Eye catching decor and courteous staff will attract you right away.We didn't set our expectations high enough because we are used to the standard of Kasturi which is 2 minutes walk from here. We were wrong!
Food is awesome. We started with Rice bowl,Sona mug er daal and jhuri alu vaja but quickly jumped onto chingri sheel e baata, kaski machher chachhori,doi rui,aar macher bori beguner jhol,sorshe parshe and prawn malaikari.Each and every item can compete with Kasturi and Prawn items I found tastier than any other restaurants.We ended up with aam er chatni and mishti doi. I sincerely hope that they will maintain this quality in future.I am also attaching the menu card for all. Banglar shaad rocks!!!!
