Delicious Maggie at good price. Cheese maggie , cheese corn maggie is the best.
A small place but jas a good ambience must visit at least once.

Making items of different taste with maggie noodles beyond their recommended recipe is an art, and Maggi Point has successfully became a master in that art. Tried their "Panjabi Tadka Maggi", "Mixed Sauce Maggi", "Sizzling Maggi", "Cheese Corn Maggi", "Tandoori Maggi". However by appearence they were very similar, taste-wise they were very distinct to each other. Both were delicious. I have never experienced a regular and very conventional maggi in such a mouthwatering way. Do try their products. A highly recommended restaurant.

Amazing Maggi..... It's just delicious.  My favorite was  Tandoori Maggi and Chilli garlic Maggi... Will again visit to try other options as well.
