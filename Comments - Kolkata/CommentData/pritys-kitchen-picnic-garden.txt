This place has no doubt improved!
So from 2.0 to 4.0.
Brilliant food, brilliant service!
Fast Delivery!

They mistakenly sent me Mixed F.Rice but due to my dad's allergy, requested to change and they did. Ypu don't get this from such a small shop! Thanks!

Chicken Fried Rice(8/10): A lot of add-ons, quantity is great, can serve 2 if there's starters. Well cooked and delicious rice!

Chilly Chicken(8/10): It was exemplary! Delicious 12 pieces, decently sized for Rs 170. You can ask for more gravy, more spicy/sweetness etc.

The food is good enough. And the price to taste ratio was more than average. Ordered a chilly prawn and mixed rice. Liked the food. Thumb's up. THE ONLY CON IS THEY PROVIDE VERY LESS GRAVY WITH THEIR SIDES.

As you can see from the picture the special noodles was excellent but the kung pao chicken was not as expected it lacked a bit of taste but this is my second order! So its actually not that bad. For 300 in an area like picnic garden is worth the money folks!

I really just wanted to say bad and give minimum rating but zomato demanded 140k. Always passed through this place for years. Tonight I wanted to try a different place so ordered myself a Chilli Mushroom: Mushroom individually tasted like it was wrapped with a batter made of corn flower and water and then deep fried using an oil probably a week's old. Since asked my dish to be dry. So the remaining ingredients like onion, capsicum and garlic we just tossed together with some tomato sauce and vinegar. Absolutely Ridiculous.

I ddn't visit the place but had home delivery twice & I ddn't expect such a eatery to be so nearby my home at such an affordable price & ethics. Had walked passed the restaurant lots of time, never to peek in cuz of the small size & location. 1st I was surprised at how well mannered all the attendant & delivery boy is.. 2nd the quantity of the food was enough for three, yes just one main course & side dish will serve three happily.. 3rd the taste was pretty good, my special mention till now is the Mongolian fried rice, Honey chicken & Mixed Veg. The Schezwan Chicken was a bit salty when cool. Lastly the prices are quite reasonable & dsnt pinch the pocket at all considering the quantity. 
As only one review is allowed.. This place delivers food before time if ordered online. This is my life line now!

This food joint is one of my personal favorites as it not only delivers food ON TIME but also makes sure that it suits the tastebuds. With strongly agree with other reviewers here - quantity of food served as per the price is really good. Thanx Prity's Kitchen for making those lazy evenings ever better with good food.

I usually order from home or from my friends' houses...they have improved their cooking a lot...all the  food really taste good...and the most interesting part is even the delivery boys are trying their hands in cooking and they haven't disappointed me my family and friends...u guys should definitely try to taste someday the cooking of the boy named Arjun...just yesterday only he cooked dry chilly chicken for my family and it tasted awfully good!!! I just couldn't believe he can cook so well...he is really a surprise package...

just ordered some amazing dishes from this place , its quite affordable and when i say affordable it means you dont have to check your wallet while ordering your food. the quantity is more than enough for two people , the best part about this place is the flavour it offers us every time you order from here . this is basically a take out joint a small place ¬†to eat inside , but mainly a takeout joint . the staff is always very friendly when they come with the home delivery , you know when a simple "thank you " when you give them the money brings a smile on your face , this place is about that.
my favourite schezwan fried rice even better with the proteins and order it spicy if you can take the heat ofcourse .
taste -4\5
value for money - 3.5\5

I opted for home delivery from Prity's kitchen, and every time they amazed me with their fast delivery services.

Their Chinese dishes are simply delicious. The quality of their food is good and the quantity is enough for filling stomach of two persons (specially noodles & side dishes).

I simply love the starters offered by them, its yummy, crisp from outside and juicy from inside. I would highly recommend drums of heaven & chilli garlic mushrooms/prawns from their vast offerings.

Their home delivery service is highly recommended, when you are feeling like having your food delivered at your doorstep & sharing with others.

Okay ! How to start  being the first time i am reviewing in ZOMATO. Well this place so called PRITY'S KITCHEN  is very close to my house and it takes around 3 mins walking to reach there. Home delivery is available but i prefer going there as it helps me interact with the staff members about different dishes.

Nothing great about the interior of this place. It is a very .......... i mean very very small outlet and no one should think about sitting there and having the food even they have place a table and two chairs.  Just kidding .......... dine-in is not available over here  :P  But one think which drive me over here again and again is the food. I really don't know how many times i have been here. 
Now straightway coming to the food.

STARTERS
DRUMS OF HEAVEN is my favourite. It is deep fried and served with schezwan sauce. A must try over here are the DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. The way they make is just too perfect. 

MAIN COURSE
 I have tried MIXED FRIED RICE  and SINGAPORE RICE ............. it was good but both tasted somewhat the same irrespective of the different names. Now coming to the noodles .............. i have tried all being a huge fan of noodles ............. but schezwan noodles is the one they make the best.  
With this one should try CHICKEN KUNG PAO ........... goes best with it.  CHICKEN IN  MANCHURIAN SAUCE is one worth a try. 

The quantity they give is enough for 1 and a half  person. The quality is also descent compared to what they charge. Its really cheap. When running out of money and u want chinese food quickly ............. then PRITY'S KITCHEN is a must try.  

And as per as the delivery and the staff ................ they deliver very quickly and talks in a very friendly way .................. and even ask for suggestions to improve the quality of their food .............. 

This humble behavior  of them and the price forces me come here again and again.

I had written a review on prity‚Äôs earlier,but somehow it‚Äôs not here anymore.the techs who oversaw the revamping of zomato must have been sloppy.besides this one,two other reviews of mine have gone missing and I don‚Äôt know which ones.sigh! so much for my dismay,let‚Äôs talk about this  eatery now.it comes across as a shanty,the very symbolic  small place tinsel  eateries of kushtia-colony bazaar region that have outgrown like mushrooms,but have failed to sustain their  rendition of a take out  food corner. Prity‚Äôs is probably the safest bet in this region.i‚Äôve ordered food many times over the years from here.
what's good-The quantity is¬† humungous.Their mixed rice and noodles of any sauce is good for two,and is always very richly dished out with chicken,egg and shrimps.The large soups are like really large and it generally takes more than a day for a single person to finish it off,unless he/she is planning to have nothing else.They also make very good drums of heaven,chicken lollipop,crispy conjee chicken,chilli egg and momos.Their indian dishes aren't that good,but still brings a variation to the otherwise strictly chinese menu.They have a few thai items as well,and I liked their thai red and green curry fish.
The prices are also very reasonable and economic to say the least.

What's bad-Late night orders are sometimes delayed,and it's safer to place¬† order within 9pm.

WHOLESOME FOOD FROM PRITY'S KITCHEN!
3.5 out of 5 

As its name suggest, Prity's Kitchen dishes out homemade and wholesome Chinese and north Indian fare. But the Chinese dishes are simply more delicious than the North Indian items. Both their fares are available at affordable prices. The quantity of food offered by them is huge and stomach filling. This is basically one of the best home delivery service options in Kolkata. It is quite unfortunate that they do not offer a dine-in option; yet the food more than makes up for it. 

Their starters are quite popular among the residents of the Ballygunje area. They are not only tasty but fresh and fast and good too. The starters are crispy while remaining soft and juicy. Some of their tastiest items are Drums of Heaven, Manchurian Fish (dry), Chilli Garlic Prawn, Pepper Chicken and other mouth watering items. Equally tantalizing are their veg starters like Chilli Corn, Chilli Garlic Mushroom, Spinach Corn Wanton and Veg Manchurian. Their well seasoned and light soups are also delightful preparations. A special mention must be made of their Manchow Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Tom Yum Kung Soup and Spicy Corn Soup. The soups are served with lots of vegetables and meat pieces that leave you feeling full. As side dishes, their non veg and veg items are equally substantial and mouthwatering. Sweet and Sour Veg, Mix Veg in Black Bean Sauce or in Sichuan sauce go great with both noodle and fried rice staples. Some wonderful and aromatic fried rice dishes prepared by them are their Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, Korean Fried Rice and Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice. To go with fried rice some worthy main course non veg side dishes are their Sweet and Sour Fish, Sichuan Fish, Chilli Oyster Prawn, Kung Pao Chicken and Hot Garlic Chicken.

Prity's Kitchen is definitely a strong contender in the food business. When you feel like having your food home delivered, do check out their vast offerings.
