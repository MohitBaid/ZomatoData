Nice food a good ambience a place worth visiting for food lovers at affordable price.
I just loved the taste of murg asani Mirch 
And mutton biryani is one of the best I have tasted in Calcutta. If the restaurant continues to maintain its taste then in the very near future it would be THE BEST in Calcutta

Last night we celebrated our anniversary at this place.  This is new multi cuisine joint located on M.G road. As the name suggests 'sufi' this is a heaven for kabab lovers. They have got an array of sufiani delicacies. One must try their kabab plater.
We ordered reshmi kabab, chicken lollypop, hongkong chicken, chilly garlic rice and firni. Prices are reasonable including GST. Nice decor and polite service people. Quantity is satisfying for 2 people. 
I want to highlight the feature of the sufi dishes. Kababs were tender moist 6 pics at Rs 210 is enough to drag me there for some more frequent visits. Firni was way to better than expected. I would rate their firni more than any other popular moghlai joints in Kolkata.

Good food with friendly staff and real reasonable price. Really enjoyed my time as a couple. The decor is also spot on. I strongly recommend everyone to dine in here while they're at college street.

The interior decoration is charming. The staffs are polite and professional. But when it comes to the food, they have a long way to go. I have tried three items. One of their special kabas, i.e Cheese Kabab is good enough to satisfy your taste buds. The mutton biriyani is small in quantity and its too much light in taste. The firni has a lot of similarities with Kesar Pista Ice-cream, which I didn't like at all..

I strongly recommend everyone to dine in here while they're at college street. Be it Chinese or Indian, they make it a point to serve you the best!

I hope my review will be helpful to everyone who reads it!
Thank you!

If you all out there are wanting to have great mughlai food,this is the place you all should visit once. It calls itself a multi cuisine restaurant but kind of work as a specialist restaurant in every domain of cuisine. The affordability coupled with amazing food leaves me with other option but to write about it in such a detailed manner. The mutton rahara it serves is mouth watering and is a must try thing. If it continues to run in such smooth consonance with the taste of the food and the affordability,trust me people it is going to be one of the very best in the coming days.Being a foody I've had tasted a lot in many restaurants but at least the Indian and the mughlai items thus restaurant serves has no match in the city.The biryani and mutton champ is something to die for.Overall an eleven out of ten to the restaurant.

Nice food and good ambience I  went with my friends.We ordered malai kabab at first it's taste was just muahhh it felt as if the malai kabab melted in my mouth.It was followed by chicken biryani and mutton chap.they were equally good.At last we ordered furniture and fruit cream to sum up the bill amounted to RS 940 for 4 people which is quite cheap at this kind of restaurant. I would like to come to Sufi Palace again and again to relish it's other delicacies
