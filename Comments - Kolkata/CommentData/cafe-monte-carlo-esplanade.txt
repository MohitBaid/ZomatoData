Rather than a place especially for after-office goers this place can also be a good hangout spot especially for college going student,especially because getting some drinks at pocket friendly rates coupled up with good quality food is hard to find nowadays.People trying popular places many of which gives a big hole in your pocket can give it a try.If you think this is just another of those cheap booze places then it would appropriate to inform you this place is there SINCE:1939 maintain decent quality through all these years.A 5-star rating for few of these
P.S try the floor uptairs if you want a more trendy crowd

There are lots of eateries which serve good chicken items. This one does too. But that's NOT why you should go to this place. Go there to try the fish items which they serve. You'll be amazed. Is it congested? It doesn't matter if it is congested. They serve great food and the place is comfy, period. Go grab a bite there.

If you are a true bong and an admirer of fish and drinks, this is the place to go. The mourola Mach fry is delicious, the chicken dishes are also above average. You might be disappointed with the ambience and the lack of variety of beers, but this place with its old kolkata feel with heritage dripping from the walls, will surely tinker with your nostalgic faculties.

Kolkata and shady bars have a unique bittersweet relationship ‚Äì as I am sure most cities have their own personal trysts with basic bars. The list of such watering holes in the city is long, and you would find almost all the famous ones near the erstwhile office-para, in and around Chowringhee, Esplanade, and Dalhousie. The shady bars of Kolkata have always been the roof under which office-going males unite to vent out after tiring days of work, only to return to the ferocity of their wives, who always know what their husbands have been up to. It is very usual to spot solo drinkers in these places, and that‚Äôs your marker for an office-para bar. A factor that sets apart these joints in Kolkata is the low-cost food ‚Äì almost each of them have their specials. The ubiquitous Fish Finger can be spotted at N number of tables if you went looking across the dimly lit passages. However, I had no idea about this particular joint before a friend commented on a picture of Broadway Hotel which was posted recently (shall write about it some other time). The comment made me want to visit Monte Carlo as it promised some great Bhetki, and as you‚Äôd already know, a good Bhetki stokes my joie de vivre. Hence, this Friday, the trip was made.

One look at the place (operational since 1939, no less), and I knew this was going to be an experience. We climbed up the signature steep stairs to a more exclusive upper-tier (branded as family section), to find only binging males (not unusual). And we didn‚Äôt have a problem. The dark passage lit with red fairy lights convinced me that this was a place which my dad would recognize with a wry smile ‚Äì ‚ÄúMonte Carlo ki ajker jayga naki?‚Äù (Do you think it‚Äôs a place I don‚Äôt know about?) ‚Äì reminiscing on a few hazy college evenings, some of them perhaps flirtatious, perhaps not. After all, the place seemed perfectly suitable for indulging in dreamy conversations to escape the dreariness of lectures and routines.

Well, all the romanticizing complete, we got down to business. We settled in, of course a bit cramped, and called for a few white rums and beers. They were served with the complementary chakna, pickled cucumbers and gingers, and rock salt. I have special love for pickled gingers that many bars across Kolkata serve, and that was a bonus I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The first food order in a shady bar is mandatorily Fish Fingers, and we paired that up with a Chili Mourola, an item I bet you wouldn‚Äôt find anywhere else. The Fish Fingers were damn nice, made with original Bhetki, albeit a bit low on the actual fish and high on the crust. Well, a bit of carb intake never hurts during drinking, and we weren‚Äôt nitpicking. Served with excellent, thick fries and onions, they flew into oblivion with some ketchup, green chili sauce and the quintessential kashundi, or Bengali mustard. Then we focused on the Chili Mourola, which was damn good as well. Mourola (or Mola) is one of the niche Bengali fishes, with each measuring up to 10 cms in length, or smaller. We generally have them fried to a crispy divinity, but Monte Carlo did something different with them. They batter fried the individual fishes, and then saut√©ed them with some sauces and lots of green chilies, and the end product was unique as well as tasty. They were devoured in due time.

The second round of starters included a plate each of Bhetki Bhaja, Bhetki Lonka Chili, and Katla Bhaja ‚Äì and they lived up to our expectations, perhaps a little more. The Bhetki Lonka Chili was similar to the Mourola preparation, with the fish being batter-fried Bhetki cubes. The sauce that hugged the pieces may not have been authentic Chinese, but the dish came together nicely, with the chilies providing a punch worth its weight. The Bhetki Bhaja or Fry was epic ‚Äì four fat (and I mean really fat, check the pics) chunks of the fish deep fired without any unwanted spices ‚Äì which meant that the crust was wafer thin, and the fish inside was unadulterated love. Flaky, warm, and a dollop of sublime happiness. Though the Bhetki was not a-grade (and the price point meant that it wouldn‚Äôt be), but it was still a better catch than many other places would dream to provide at that price. The Katla (major Indian Carp) Fry was great as well, and the sizes of the four pieces were remarkable. Monster cuts from the stomach of the fish, replete with the skin and a fat layer of fat (excuse that), deep fried in mustard oil till crispy goodness ‚Äì what else do you need with your drink? Nothing, and we didn‚Äôt.

The ending notes were disastrous in terms of food ‚Äì as the Chili Chicken we ordered with a plate of Mixed Fried Rice, was horrible and tasted closer to an Indian curry than a Chinese one. The fried rice was just about okay. But I guess we were beyond such worldly thoughts, and had already been planning our after party (most shady bars close by 10-30-11 pm). The place was almost empty, and the person serving us allowed a few smokes inside the facilities, even pampering us with a plastic bag full of ice (for the after party). We slowly walked outside to a characteristically humid Kolkata night, slightly drunk, perhaps from the experience, or maybe, just maybe, from the weight of memories and musings steeped in eight decades of alcohol.

If u are a bengali and love to drink with "Machh Bhaja" this the place to be. Its a OLD PUB with the less luxury and extravaganza, but u get all sorts of fishes properly fried or cooked to make u happy. Even the veg and chicken dishes are good. Have visited multiple times in last 5 years and will keep on visiting till the food quality remains same.

I visited this place with some of my friends. Now we all are regretting that why did we visit this place! It's a bar cum resturant. We ordered dry chilli chicken and chowmein. We just hated the dry chilli chicken which tasted like fish, fried with some garlic and sauce! And the quantity of the chowmein was not enough according to the price. If you just want to booze then this place is ok but don't try their food.

Please try tandoori chicken Chinese and chili dry morola. Fabulous test with superb quantity and quality.
Only thing is bar menu is not updated in Zomato. Prices are 30-40 rupees higher than this menu snaps. But still very affordable.
Will recommend everyone to visit once, you will really like it.

If u are a fish lover then this place is best for u. Nicely located in between Dalhousie nd Chandni chowk, its a bar with some delicious fish items. Drinks are cheap since its situated in an office area. Service is slow but they will repeatedly refill your chanachur as soon as it gets empty. A very dimly lit place which makes u intoxicated in 2 or 3 drinks. Generally we visit this place when we r short of cash. Do try their chilli tandoori chicken nd chilli bhekti and not to mention their morola fish preparation. It tastes heaven with ur whiskey.

A place where people go for the cheap alcohol, therefore can't really expect much in terms of service or food, which are in fact are average. Most of the items on their food menu remain unavailable except the staples like chilli chicken or chicken pakora or at least they were unavailable ¬†when we were there.

If you are acquainted with the old Calcutta, Monte Carlo wouldn't probably be a novel name to ring a bell. This almost 80 years old cafe (or pub, as I call it) has really awesome things to surprise your tummy and toungue. Apart from cheap alcohol, you can go for fishes, which are really worth mentioning. It's probably a rumour that they didn't change their cook for the last 36 years and so not interrupting the old Calcutta charm of flavours.

Would recommend to them who really want to enjoy the Calcutta flavour... :)

Many people will take it as a Coffee shop, as the name sounds, Cafe Monte Carlo. even we had this thought that this eatery might be a coffee shop. But this is basically a Bar and restaurant located at bara Bazar, next mangoe lane building serving quick starters and drinks at affordable prices.

It was almost 8-830 pm when we checked in there and the place was quite crowded with mostly office goers grabbing some quick drinks. Dim lighting and the average ambience. place was suffocating and not enough leg and table spaces with a low ceiling heights. ACs were placed at a very low heights and the direct flow of air was coming to our head which was quite irritating.¬†

For drinks we ordered, Smirnoff. the prices of alcohol was quite reasonable in comparison of neighbouring outl;ets serving the same menu. this was the reason of it being it so crowded i guess. For Starters, we had plan to order something else but the server suggested us Tandoori chilli chicken, which was their house speciality. the food took time to arrive but it was well made and was soothing to our taste buds.. ¬†

Liquor service was quick and the people were attentive,

I have been visiting Kolkata for the past one week, and visited Dalhousie area today. With the intent of having lunch followed by espresso, I went out looking for a cafe. And there it was: Cafe Monte Carlo. Little did I know that the place would be a bummer: it's a dingy bar-cum-restaurant whose menu contains items half of which are simply absent from the kitchen while the other half struggle from identity crises of the unimaginably worst kind.

Biryani? No donut for you. Looking for coffee? Not in "Cafe" Monte Carlo. I ordered one Prawns Fried Rice. What was served was a leviathan plate full of fried rice with accidental pieces of shrimps that had to be dug out underneath the heap of rice the same way archaeologists must have had to unearth Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt, only for much less glory.

I might have to revisit the City of Joy just to avoid this non Cafe.

Ohk many people do not know this place but right now this is one of the value for money bars that I can go to. This place is in the heart of the "Office-Para" i.e. Office Neighbourhood, so most of the crowd you get are people coming for a drink with colleagues. But the prices at which they serve alcohol is outstanding in this inflated market. The prices are reasonable and the food is good too. I tried the chilli chicken tandoori (yes its one dish) and it was one of the really unique things I have had recently. Other delicacies are the Bhetki butter masala, Roast Chicken, Bhetki Butter Fry, etc. You will love the fish there at the prices.¬†
I suggest this place for when you are short of money but wanna have a drink with your buddies. Do try this place. I give 4/5.

I can say this place is ideal for a small group of Boys/Men for spending a relaxing time after the whole day work . .

I can not say about the family section, which is situated upstairs of the same premises . . a bit dark environment..Price is reasonable . . .
the waiters are busy all time, you cannot expect them to assist you for orders, but they are very proficient in their job..

The specialty (which I liked very much) is they serve different Fried Fishes (mach vaja) ..which is a ultimate consinear for bengali people..

Cafe Monte Carlo is a cosy little joint where one can go and have 'Adda' over a couple of drinks and delicious food. Its an eighty year old quintessential bar cum restaurant located at the heart of the 'Office Paara'. I loved their tandoori chilly chicken a lot. its a fusion dish and a must try. next comes chilly morola (fish)... Yes!!! I tasted this item for the first time in my life and i must say its ambrosia! The chef has been there for last 36 years and over the years he has innovated different types of such dishes which are irresistible. So next time you are at Dalhousie this is the place you must visit.

As a frequent visitor of this watering hole, I want to mention that this is one of those rare bars of old Calcutta, frequented by the middle class office goer, that allows you to enjoy your drink with good food. It is cheap, but doesn't attract cheap crowd. It's not comfortable, but it comforts your pocket. Sip your beer with a plate of fish fingers and indulge in a hearty conversation with your partner. Or even better, strike a conversation with a complete stranger! 
Also try the tikkas and tandooris.... they might not be the best, but are good enough to enjoy with the drink. The free supply of chanachur and  raw ginger makes your experience all the more enjoyable. 
Not a place to bring the ladies. But a good place to de-stress after a hard day's work at the 'office para'!

It is a nice watering hole at the heart of Dalhousie office para. After office hours many people come here to quench their thirst. It has two floors. Price is moderate. I love the snacks they serve. They serve nuts, onion, tomato, cucumber, ginger and what not. The food quality is also good. Not very elegant though. Frequented by contractors, office baboos.
