We visited this restu for a post exam stress buster hangout. We attended their buffet. It has six starters,main course and desserts. .. delicacies include indian and chinese cuisines. Tastes were great. I found the reshmi kebab and chicken lollypop really succulent and well cooked. 
   Price is very reasonable. The decor was simple yet elegant with plush sofas n chairs. Staffs were very polite and courteous with prompt service. i loved the fact that they provide finger bowls with rose petals floating on it and 'paan' at the end which is so uncommon now a days to find ( hate those chlor-mint thingies!).
  Only one thing i would like to recommend that they should increase the number of desserts (its awfully less in number,being only some fruits, vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce and hot gulabjamun). 
Overall it was a very pleasant experience to visit 'since 2016'. I would recommend this restu for a pocket friendly buffet destination which will surely appease ur appetite. Love to come back once more!
Cheers and happy eating 😊

This place is located just opposite to CC1 and is famous for Corporate lunches / dinners and get togethers (just go by the reviews)

I went there with my colleagues on one such get together for office. The food is worth given their economic rate.

Starting from different starters (options for both veg and non veg) to main course (option for both Indian and Chinese) and to the Dessert (Gulab Jamun and Mishti Dahi - the Dahi was just yummy).

They also had luchi / begunbhaja (had to write this in bengali for the effect - brinjal fry) in their menu.

Again I recommend this place for Corporate / Casual get togethers and given their reasonable price.

We were there for lunch buffet. First thing I must say is, this is best place for buffet in such reasonable price, I have visited so far. 

Ambiance: we loved their decorations. Though this is a small place, but so cozy and peaceful. 

Food: food was awesome. Specially the starter was too good. I loved the chicken sweet corn soup they served. Chicken fries and fish cutlet were awsome too. What I liked the most is the "luchi begun bhaja" at the main course. Other foods at the main course were great too. We had plain rice, mutton, chicken curry, muri ghonto, mocha with chingri, sorshe pabda.  All were tasty excluding muri ghonto and mutton. Sorshe pabda was very nice. Overall we loved the food.

Service: The staffs were courtesies and well behaved. Totally satisfied by their service.

Will visit again !!

I have tried their "Chicken Steak" through Zomato delivery and this review is only based on that item only, and certainly its not a complete review of this restaurant. The steak was cooked in pepper sauce and served along with boiled vegetables and garlic bread. Every item was tasty. Generous amount of chicken was served. The ligtly cooked chicken had a nice aroma of pepper. Boiled veggies also tasted different and good to me. I enjoyed the overall taste of the item. They served a complimentary 'Paan' that I liked too.

Today I visited there without team mates, and the experience was very bad. Though we chose buffet but most of the items were insufficient and whenever asked to repeat any item that took too much of time for that. Starting from baby corn, soup, fish everything were just total waste. Ice cream was very hard.once Sweet finished , they were very reluctant to refill. Overall very bad experience. Worst restaurant in kolkata.

I still remember the day when I went there. It's a late review by the way. It was a lonely day of winter and I wanted the lonliness to end with the shot of "what she would've done". So I decided to end it with the all time smile-maker, "FOOD". When I scrolled through numerous food suggestions and list of restaurants (via Zomato). This one caught my eyes. Because of the unique name and storyline behind the name. I was infront of RDB at 9:00 PM and I was well aware about the fact that most of the restaurants would be jacked up and I will not get the peace of Mind if I look for more and more. So I stopped my search of restaurants and took UBER as a medium to reach my destination. I approached towards the entrance of the building when One Guy came and ask the guard to guide me till the restaurant's entry which is situated at the 3rd floor I believe (Pardon my memory, it tests me sometimes). So I entered in place after departing from the lift, and trust me the day couldn't have gone better. I know that restaurant owner(whom I met by the way at the time of leaving) won't be happy commenting me  this, but : "I loved the fact that it was empty, the ambience was perfect for the day to end "(Please don't kill me). The wall caught my eye the most, because it was filled with pictures of places all over the world, including india(which by the way has been taken personally by the owner of the restaurant). Then it came to my attention, the awesome bar, which was in a  parallel manner as beautiful as the whole place is. Standing small but giving complex to everything situated at the moment. NO HARD DRINKS guys, but the soft drinks are the taste of heaven itself. Ordered myself *Virgin Blue Lagoon* which I will not be able to forget ever because I had two of them, can't express in words how tasty it was. Beside that I ordered Tom Yum soup with seafood which was great partner in crime with the lagoon. After completing the whole soup and  the lagoon, I ordered "Konjee crispy Lamb" : well, I know Lamb itself is enough for mouth watering experience. However, if you wanna feel magic in your mouth, you are always welcome to try this. The lamb's crispness was not bound to time, no matter how slow you eat, it will taste the same after 15-30 minutes as well. To complete the night, I ordered - Bhuna Ghost & Jeera Rice, which was enough to make me feel.. "aaah".. By the time I was typing this, I ignored the most eluding thing of the place. The staff were overwhelmingly awesome in terms of "অতিথি দেব ভব". They have beared all my tantraums of serving the items slowly and steadily as I wanted to enjoy every food like it's the last meal of mine and they have done it with the same smile and pace till I left the place. And guess what, after all this, her message blinked at the screen, what else can you expect from a day haan! 

Below are some photos of the place which I believe will encourage you to give this place a try:

After entering the restaurant i felt the decor is just not up to the mark. Felt normal. As soon as you will get a seat for yourself they will give you fresh towel which is quite unique in restaurants. The menu is quite diverse. You will get chinese,thai,indian and english cuisine. We ordered a badami murgh tikka, a chef's special rice and a sezwan fish. I liked the badami murgh which was quite delicious , soft , succulent and easily melting. Sezwan fish was mild spicy which was good for me. Overall i liked the food. All that which doesn't go with everything good there is the decor and the music. I would like the official to take a step regarding it. Otherwise chef and other staff are doing good jobs. Well done. We would like to see since 2016 run for many more years. All the best.

Was there on 25th December. The whole joint was crowded like anything though we had managed to get a table. Service was very slow, given the order at around 9ish and received the food at 10.12 pm. But the food was awesome. I am totally satisfied when we tried lamb shank @ risotto. Waiting crews are quite decent and knows well how to treat guests.

I went there during Durga puja to have lunch....the decor is pretty decent and most importantly the restaurant is very spacious so you won't have that claustrophobic feeling there... 
Coming to the quality of food... I had chicken biriyani along with a mutton side dish (I forgot the exact name... so sorry :( )...and to be honest, both were delicious... I really enjoyed the dishes... I haven't tasted any desserts so can't comment on that but I have had a glass of lemon soda which again was refreshing and was decently prepared ...:) ... 
Now for the service-- I went there on Nabami afternoon... so as expected the place was crowded and I had to wait for about 10-15 mins for getting a table... the food was served a bit late too... but I cannot complain as it was during Durga puja.. :/ ... but I would like to mention that the staffs were polite and well behaved so far from my experience... :)
Should I recommend this place?? Of course yes !! :) I am sure you would have a great family time there... :) And I too would love to visit this place again to try out some new dishes and will keep updating... !! Thank You...:)

Situated near City Centre 1, Salt Lake, Sector 1. Very easy to find. We were welcomed very nicely. They have a good seating arrangement. The ambience is also good . They have a light music playing in the background, which gives a very good feel while eating. Now comes the menu. I and my friend ordered non veg buffet . We were given started on the table. The menu for the starters was :

Lemon Coriander soup : the taste was good however if was definitely not a lemon coriander soup as it was not having even a little bit of taste of either lemon or coriander. It was having the taste of spinach.

Salt n pepper baby corn : Not at all good. It was cold from inside. Not at all salty.

Chicken lollipop : was good but it was also cold from inside.
Chicken and pander tikka : both were good.
Main course : They have a Indian menu for the main course. They have salad, chicken rice, noddles, steam rice, Roti, yellow dal, mix vegetables , chicken kassa, chicken Manchurian. All of the main course was good but the there was very less salt in all of those.
Desert : Gulab jamun, pomegranate, ice cream.
Rating :
Food : 2.5/5

Ordered home delivery from this restaurant yesterday. The items ordered were- Chicken Biryani combo, Dhania Murg and butter naan. Food was delivered hot. Dhania Murg was bit on the spicier side though I had particularly requested them to make it non spicy for my daughter. Biryani quantity was too less. However the reshmi chicken kabab made up for it.  Not bad at all. Maybe will order again. One point to mention- since it was not a buffet- the items were a tad pricey with taxes, . ( Need to balance food quantity with price quoted).

Very good ambiance, exceptional customer service, whole fleet is involved in serving the best they have got to you, lacks little bit in food quality and taste but I think that is one thing that could be over come with time, other than that just one word - Awesome !!! 

The experience is worth remembering, we went as a long group , its delicious some of the items in the menu like Kadhai Chicken, and Murg Lababdar, Since 2016 special is a series to go for.

This economical place for buffet is a delight for ur pockets..the starters are a variety..a tad bit monotonous..the hot and sour chicken soup was average..the drumsticks were good..the chicken reshmi kebab was yumm..the crispy fried chicken were worthless..the fried wantons were good...the achaari paneer tikka was pretty tasty..the jack potato was not that good..
Coming to main course..the noodles were crisp and tasty..the fried rice was a tad bit less tasty..
The chilli garlic chicken was very average..
Chinese main course fused with traditional bengali food..ah..dint work..
The basanti pulao was a gem..the katla kalia average..
The kosha patha was good..a tad bit fibrous..
The chicken was average..
The chatni was okayish..
The dessert was good because of the chomchoms..the mishti doi was too good..
Vanilla icecream wd chocolate sauce ended the journery well...
Overall good ..but needs to improve quality..
Ambience and service wont let u complain

Went there a month ago, was so very disappointed with their service that I did not feel to give a review to this place. The taste of each and every dish was so bad that it is impossible to give a review. We did not taste the Chinese food because after having the Indian /Bengali cuisine the desire eat completely died. All the starters were served cold and the dim sum was hard with thick cold flour crust. They served Fish Paturi, it was Katla(Rou) fish which was full of bones. Paturi with bones!! There was no salt in it, the spices was not properly marinated moreover the fish was not cooked properly at all. It was a disgusting experience.
The buffet price was very cheap and so was their dishes.

It's a small restaurant located right in front of 'balle balle dhaba'. I had been there for the lunch buffet on a weekday and found it really reasonable on comparing the quality of food and it's price. If you're a vegan,you might not get many options in the buffet,but if not then this place is gonna be your right call. The staff is courteous and the ambience is also nice and peaceful.

The place is located close to City Center 1. Its a small restaurant on the 3rd Floor! The ambience ,decor and overall feel of the place is pretty good ! I went on a Saturday lunch and it wasn't that crowded ! We ordered the following:
1. Hot and Sour Soup (4/5) - The taste, quantity of the soup was excellent and was a great appetizer to start a meal
2. Konjee Crispy Mushroom (3/5) - The taste was good enough but the quantity was pretty less! Go for other starters instead.
3. Vetki Biriyani Combo (3/5) : This was the first time tried a fish biriyani. They offer it as a combo but the quantity is very very less, as it is served more in a Thali with inner partitions. The vetki was good, but the biriyani was not upto the mark! There was absolutely no salt in it ! Not a good choice for a main course but an economical option.
4. Burnt Ginger Capsicum Ginger Fried Rice (4/5) : This was served hot and tasty ! Decent !
5. Stirred fried mixed vegetables with sweet chilly garlic and holy basil (1/5) : The worst dish of the lot , tried this as a first time but was very very disappointed with the quality of the gravy and the overall dish ! Not recommended !
6. French Fries (4/5) : Decent and sufficient quantity for two people !

Overall a good restaurant , with great ambience and decent food at a moderate price ! The staff are friendly and eager to serve which makes it a good experience !

Went there on nabami night with friends. We did not have any plan to went there. Accidentally I went there,asking for seats with no hope. But we got it in a second. I was so impressed with staffs behaviour. Ambience was good. Foods were really nice. But biryani taste was not up to the mark. Side dishes were mouth watering. Gonna visit this place again. I m giving 4.5 stars to this restaurant.

Went there a month ago, was so very disappointed with their service that I did not feel to give a review to this place. The taste of each and every dish was so bad that it is impossible to give a review. We did not taste the Chinese food because after having the Indian /Bengali cuisine the desire eat completely died. All the starters were served cold and the dim sum was hard with thick cold flour crust. They served Fish Paturi, it was Katla(Rou) fish which was full of bones. Paturi with bones!! There was no salt in it, the spices was not properly marinated moreover the fish was not cooked properly at all. It was a disgusting experience.
The buffet price was very cheap and so was their dishes.

I really could not figure out what all the hype in all the previous reviews about the restaurant’s hospitality was about, since I did not face any such hospitality. However, there was a staff down at the main entrance who took us to the 3rd floor eatery which was quite a nice gesture. The rating here has been given mainly to the food which is quite a decent spread at the price kept for the buffet. My only doubt remains as to why I was charged 600+tax when the board outside (which, I noticed on my way out) clearly stated Mon-Thurs : 459+tax. My visit day being Monday.

Visited for a puja lunch since both 6 Ballygang place and Oudh were closed till the evening. We stuck to mughlai and must admit, I am quite disappointed. We ordered chicken malai kabab, murg tikka lababdar, mutton rogan josh with few plain nanns. The malai kababs were hard although not without taste, the chicken in the tikka lababdar were hard and seems to have been unmarinated, prepared straight out of the fridge, because there was no taste inside the chicken. The mutton in the rogan josh were very soft, but again there wasnt any taste inside the mutton. Also the rogan josh gravy had too much salt. The nanns were as expected. We had some kind of chinese desert which was not unpleasant. The only high point of the meal was the excellent service, very attentive, but totally unmatched by the accompanying food. All in all I am happy that I went there because now even if 6 BG Place or Oudh are closed, I wont go to Since 2016, maybe I will wait in Tea junction.

Went on saptami. Located near cc1 just opposite to balle balle dhaba.
Since it was puja time it was crowded. We were given a wait time of 30 minutes but we got our seats after one and half hour. Not only this after a long wait the hotel people asked us to share our table with others. What sort of behaviour was that I don't know.
Coming to the food ordered indian dishes. Gandhoraj fish, chicken patiala, chicken lababbdar butter naan and freshlime soda (sweet). Gandhoraj fish and chicken patiala was really good. Chicken lababdar was very blunt. Rotis were okay. Coming to the soda, It was not prepared with sugar syrup instead of it just sugar was added. We were literally able to see the cubes. This was not expected from any restaurant.

A very consise buffet to be specific. As you enter their premises they wil greet you with wet towels for refreshing yourself up. After they guide you to the table the starters would be served there , you can also gt them yourself from the spread. What is most alarming is that they dont care to serve a welcome drink for a buffet worth Rs 600+tax!FOOD-
Chicken Reshmi kebab-good
Fish tikka kebab-tasted wonderful
Fish fry-tasted good but the quality of fish was not up to the mark
Chicken lollypop-okay bt too much of batter used
Chicken fry-nice
Crispy baby corn-tasted weird
Paneer tikka- good and warm
Coming to the main course
Mixed fried rice-bland in 1 word
Mixed chowmein-ditto
A white fish preparation-was okay
Kind of chicken popcorns in soy gravy- edible
Chatni- a thrill to have it though it was just shredded bottlegourd, it was good.
Desert
Vanilla ice cream with darsaan and chocolate sauce-as ice cream should be and darsan was good
Mini Gulab jamuns- simmering in sumthing whitish (maybe dalda)
Well, so foodwise it was a big downer i wouldnt come back here atleast not for the food. And of i go by the price, other places offer a far more elaborate spread at a lower price. This buffet is not even fit for a Rs 399 tag. But their hospitality was appreciable, they have ample staff to serve you and you can even ask them to serve your refills at the table(even the main course). According to me they did very well considering i visited on sosthi in the midst of all that rush. So this rating is mainly for that, food wise.. a 2 would do.

I absolutely love the entrance decor!!!
Went in with my office people and we had booked a table in advance. The greetings was very courteous.
Ambience is really nice..

Now coming to the main part....FOOD!!!
Starters- Was good but won't say excellent!!
Expected more variety!!! Would rate it 3/5

Mains- the Chinese dishes were not awesome but surely tasty.
Now when it comes to their Bengali Main dish, I just have no words. They were just awesome and just the BEST part of this Restaurant!!!
Starting from Luchi, Begun bhaja, Basanti Pulao, Lau Chingri, Mutton.... were just too tasty and it was a real pleasure having them!!! So it's a 5/5 here.

Desserts- Oh my!!! I just can't ever forget the Gulab Jamun... it's just a next level experience... A must try!! We all were like can we just take them
Home:) as it was so tasty.
Sweet curd is also truly awesome..
Ice cream and fruits were good too.So it's a 5/5 here.

Overall, I would rate it 4 for the starters. They should improve on them. But really worth going there. I would recommend to every Foodie out there...

The order

Veg Biryani Combo- Comes with ample amount of paneer butter masala and two pieces of paneer tikka. It was filling and tasty. Though the tikka wasnt that tasty.

Dal Makhani- Tasted really good
Chana Masala- Must order! It was delicious!!
Kadai Paneer- Again, average like other paneer items.
Naan and Kulcha were delicious.

All over, it was great experience. A little change in food to be done with respect to the preparation of paneer.

Went there for an afternoon lunch, and chose for, a la carte instead of buffet. Was a bit doubtful about the place. The interiors are okay, honestly, too many colours and designs makes me feel weird.
We were served napkins, and they were dripping ice cold water. 
Ordered a manchow soup which surprisingly was good.
Ordered stuffed mushroom tikka and spring rolls, which were average.
For main course we ordered, kadhai paneer, malai kofta and dal makhani, which were good. Breads and rice were good too.
Mocktails were really good. We tried Sherilyn temple and mojito.
Service was decent, since they tried constantly to put up a very good show of hospitality, minimum defects avoided.
Food could be improved a bit. The prices are a little on a higher side. Have a potential to stand apart, by putting in a little more effort.

A little trivia first

Since 2016 is running since 2016. Such simple and straightforward name that I was bit surprised why since 2016. What was the thought behind this? I am not aware but the pursuit is on.

We had buffet lunch on sunday and it costed 499 + taxes which is quite decent.

Reshmi Kebab in starter was quite good. I had plate full of it. But, It is a shame that apart from kebab rest were ordinary or mediocre.
Chicken lollipop was just not at all upto mark.
There were no items of prawn and no complimentary drinks.
So, Resmhi Kebab is the one item in starter to go for.

Main course was decent. One has option to go for Chinese or Indian.
Indian - Yellow Rice, Dal, Mutton, Chicken, paturi, muri ghanto
Chinese - Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Noodles, Chicken Manchurian.

Dessert - Gulab Jamun, Vanilla Ice Cream, Misti Doi

One thing which bugged me was the person helping in dessert section was little hesitant to give more items. Not good sign for buffet serving restaurants.

Additionally, It is strongly recommended for vegan people to not go for buffet, if you wish to visit this resturant. You will get only potato. Aaloo, aaloo and bhot aaloo.

Rest all was good. It was decent experience bordering nice.

Located  beside City Centre 1, yet we had a hard time finding this place. Locating the entrance is a bit tricky.  
We had pre-booked our table, so didn't hav to wait. 
I felt the ambience to suitable for corporate dineouts. To my surprise, we were given wet face towels, which I think is a nice introduction. 
Coming to the food, we had buffet lunch for the day. They had various kinds of momos as starters, which were good but not great. Main course was a bit short on varieties. Nevertheless, food quality was good, but nothing special. 
Maybe... will visit again...sooooon....!!!

They served around 19-20 items of dishes. Basically the starter they served is too much quantity of variety item.  Starter was sooo yyuumm and delicious. Main cource was quite good. All Stuffs are very good.

I was searching for some good buffet places in kolkata where chinese and indian both r available...got SINCE 2016 as the best buffet till now..
Located near to cc1 and opposite to balle balle dhaba is the best place to hangout when u r hungry..the location is a bit odd but the restaurent specially the buffet section is beyond words
U got to have 7starters where u get paneer tikka,baby corn,chickn drumsticks,a type of momo,a new type kf ckn item whuch i can bet u will not get in any restaurents of kolkata..also fish fry is awesome..the starters r sooooo unique tat i couldnt explain
Nxt the main course is as good as the starters..u get to have chowmein,breads,rice,2items of ckn,soups and lots of more items..jst beyond wrds
Nxt the desserts where u will get the most authentic bengali dish-Aamer chatni ,papdad,gulabjamun,icecreams
The behaviour of the staffs r more than enough...they r too good
Ambience is moderate..
Only one suggestion-if they wud have given a complemntary wake up drink would have better..and if they open another branch of it in a location like park street they can compete wth barbeque nation on their buffet section
So jst visit once and u will understand whats SINCE 2016 is

The taste of the food is pretty average and if you go a  la carte the prices aren't very economical also. I've heard they have an awesome and pocket friendly buffet lay which I am yet to try.

I really like their buffet specially considering the money they take for it. But recently I ordered a-la-carte from here, got Murg Patiala, Maas Sule & Butter Naan. Absolutely loved the Patiala and Sule, delicious. The quantity of the Patiala was more than enough for 2-3 people. The boneless mutton kebabs were deliciously soft and tender as well, melts in your mouth. Need to try more of their dishes from the a-la-carte menu soon but for now these two dishes are highly recommended when you visit this place.

It's located opposite to Balle Balle Dhaba near city centre. We have taken the lunch buffet(non veg) which costs ₹470 including taxes.

It contains chicken soup, fish pakora, chicken n fish momo, chicken lollypop, chicken pakora, chicken kababs n chilly babycorn.
In the main course, there is a mixture of Indian n Chinese.
In desserts, they have only vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, gulam jamun n fruit salad.

Starters are nice but main course was not up to the mark n once u have starters u'll be full, can't eat much of main course. Desserts are really depressing. They have only vanilla ice cream n gulam jamun n almost burned as it is keep in a container which is continuously heating.

Staffs are nice n ambience is very nice. But the buffet is not satisfying at all.

This Newly Opened Food Joint in Salt Lake Sector-1 was in my hunt list since many days when I finally decided to take a tryout previous week.. I did not had time to go to the outlet personally and hence I thought that I would order food via Zomato from this Outlet. This was my first order from Zomato and I was quite excited about their service. At around 9:30pm, I selected Chicken Cheese Momo and Chicken Steamed Momo and added them to my order list. They showed me approximately 60 mins time to complete and deliver it to my address. Time went past and it was almost 75mins but still the order did not came. I was totally shocked and infuriated when even at 11:10pm it did not came as I called up the Zomato support team. Their response was as usual to keep patience. Finally at 11:15pm, came my food delivery. I was dissatisfied but needed to fill up my tummy. So I decided to look forward for their Momos. The packing itself was quite big and to my surprise, along with the food containers, They gave a free Paan with it. I could not believe it as I was getting a free Paan for the first time and opened the packages. I expected 6 pieces of moderately big sized momos but they served us 8 pieces of small dumplings as momos. That was dissatisfying of the quantity. Thr chicken cheese momo was not that good and was ordinary. The soup served seemed much better and sauce or the dip served was not that good nor spicy to vitalize our taste buds. The overall food experience was not that good especially with the mismanagement from the Zomato Delivery Team that made me give such less rating. I would not say the restaurant is bad but I would definitely like visit their outlet soon to tryout their other dishes and would even recommend everyone to atleast give a tryout for this outlet in Salt Lake City..!!

Main Course: 3/5 (Only Chinese was good)
Deserts: 4/5 (gulab jamun was awesome)

Average or bad-average

Just the location is good for a restaurant..as far my experience, soup and chicken rehsmi kabab was good..rest of the food items tasted bad and not cooked properly..proportion of salt was not consistent and few items tasted salty and few had no salt in them..

Cant list all the items which were bad so had to point out the better ones. 

Nothing good for veg as restricted items there..bad experience and wont ever step again here

Starters were smelling foul and main course were ordinary to say best!

So average(more like bad), that it's a sacrilege to even include it in a collection which showcases supposedly great buffet places.
Bland, just bland. Not even redeeming starters or desserts to collect points for overly underwhelming main course. Also they don't bother to heat the cold, marred food.
I bothered to put in a review, so that Zomato takes it off the list if senses knock in.
Cheap buffet? We'll if you're in for even pettier food, come in.

The best thing about this place is the welcome with the fragrant wet towel which is really refreshing. The ambience is good . The food and service was below average. We opted for buffet and we were not satisfied with the quality. This was the only buffet where you won't see any mutton platter either in starters or the main course. Even instead of welcome drinks they served papad. Very few options in starters as well as in main course too. From starter to desert, they all lacked in quality. Must say, We had a bad experience there.

We have had enough of Indian , Mughlai buffets so my friends suggested this place for a Chinese oriented buffet . I called up and got a table reserved .

Location : Adjacent to City Centre 1 and can be easily spotted .

Ambience : This was the best thing about the place . Very posh , amazing interiors , dim lighting , orange curtains allowing the sunlight to peek in . 4/5.

Coming to the food , we were served 8 kinds of starters but to our disappointed the only two eatables  were the Chicken Malai Kebab and Fish Finger. The momo tasted so bad , the baby corn seemed to have been prepared 3 days ago , the drumsticks were bland , the pepper chicken had no pepper .

Next came the main course and we were relieved that maybe now we will have a nice lunch but NO . After such a tasteless starter journey believe me the main course was just the same . Apart from the Fried Rice and Fish in Coriander Sauce ( Brilliant ) each and everything had literally no salt or very less salt. Then we ordered Butter Naan from the kitchen and it was Amazing. Very soft and buttery.

The dessert section was a limited affair with Hot GulabJamun , Darssan and Vanilla Icecream with Chocolate Syrup. But this was again the most satisfying among everything we had that day .

Starters : 2/5
Main Course : 2/5
Desserts : 3/5

They are serving the buffet at only Rs . 481 which is cheap in comparison to other buffet restaurants. But they need to understand that most people prefer quality over quantity . Increase the prices if you want but increase the quality too .

Not recommended.

Each and every time we found the food is really beautiful.  But when we orderd for the combo pack we found the rice that they provide is really very low in quantity which made me angry for that moment and even i did a phone call to the resturent.  Well appart from that love there food's teste

Went to this place couple of times, and it was a marvelous experience. It's located near 
City Center 1. 

The service and hospitality were great. 
The staffs were courteous and helpful.

We ordered Chicken Curry, Fish Tikka, Matar Paneer, Kulcha. They were awesome in taste. It is a must visit place for those who love North Indian food.

The complementary foods offered (wafer, jal-jeera, betel leaf) were good in taste.

The ambiance was great especially the interiors. 

The only blemish I found here is that only 1 person can use washroom at a time. Restaurant authorities need to improve this.

I had eaten lunch there, with 3 friends. We had the buffet @ rs 481 per person. It was awesome. They welcomed us with complimentary drinks & wet towels. Then they served us da starters which were delicious. Next we went for the main course which was also fabulous. Finally, we had dessert. The gulab jamun just blew us off. It was sooooo soft & yummy, it just melted in our mouth. In the end, they even gave us paans. This was the best lunch i had had in a ling time. A very good restaurant with lovely people. I'd definitely wanna come back later

I recalled their advertisement of value for money buffet, so on a hungry weekday went there for lunch. The ambience is good. Staff are efficient, polite and helpful. Welcome drink and wet towel, makes you feel uber. The items on offer - especially starters - are worth the price. The food is delicious undoubtedly.

I only have one concern. The menu is too Chinese based. Someone who loves Chinese will go ga ga. Manchurians, chillies, fried rice, babycorn, fish in Chinese gravy, all ended up in a non defined aftertaste.

The menu needs a rework in terms of balancing high and low notes. In buffet the trick is having a food palette that appeals to all hunger types.

So, we decided to dine in here after some exhaustive shopping at City Centre and this is how the experience went. We were first greeted with a sweetly scented wet towel to clean our hands and face. This was followed by a welcome drink (lime juice) and complimentary papad (courtesy of the house). The staff and waiters were extremely gracious.
We ordered only main course items and I should tell you it was delicious. Each item was well prepared and top notch in quality.
The bill was very reasonable for the amount of food ordered. And to top it off, they gave us paan at the end of our meal (again, courtesy of the house). Following the payment of the bill, we also received a 15% off coupon if we visit them again in a months time (which I am sure I will).

Overall, it was a fabulous experience for all of us and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try a restaurant in and around City Centre, Salt Lake.

Excellent food, I think most low cost best buffet in town. Tuesday lunch with tax only ₹481/-. Very helpful staff. Outside temperature near 39°. They welcome with cool wet towel and drinks. Very refreshing. Than they serve starter in table. Chicken malai kabab, chicken lollypop, paper chicken, fish and chips, panner tikka, crispy chili baby corn, and chicken sweet corn soup. All food are tasty. Main course chicken rice and chicken noodle, chicken with two types gravy, fish in some sauce, and 2-3 item more. Than dessert gulab jamun, ice cream and darsan. Finish with pan.I must say so low cost they're service really appreciate able. Waiting for next visit with family.

We choose the buffet menu to eat when we went there. We entered the restaurant at 3:45 p.m.. After completion of our starter, it was around 4:15 p.m.. While we were about to start the main course, the manager told us that the buffet will be closed by 4:30. We didn't knew that only. He told us to take all the food which we wanted as the buffet will be closed. Now how is it possible to eat the whole food within fifteen minutes. It was the worst experience we ever had! Also the veg items are not in a wide variety

Loacted conviniently near cc1 and advertising about their reasonable lunch buffet since quite a long time , finally i made a visit for a family weekwnd dinner. The interiors if not very chic , are cozy and we were seated comfortably. 
Not being a buffet person , we tried few dishes from their ala carte menu, KASHMIRI ALOO DUM and BUTTER NAAN from the indian section , though the kashmiri dum wasn't in white gravy as we generally expect, but the dish tasted divine. The Chinese items were CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES and KUNG PAO CHICKEN , noodles were good but the kung pao could have been done better , the gravy was thin and the dish lacked its distinct taste. From the continental sections we tried the CHICKEN TETTRAZINI which was a heavenly dish with chicken baked in white sauce with cheese and BOILED CHICKEN IN NEAPOLITANA SAUCE which couldn't impress us. We felt their Chinese and continental sections need improvement.
The best part was the service , very efficient and caring staff , they offered wet towels and a complimentary aam panna welcome drink the moment wet sat down, and paan at the end of the meal.

Hospitality was good. But food was below average and a lot of improvement is required on that part. I can understand if buffet is priced at 481/- with tax then it is quite reasonable and a lot of varities cannot be expected but if the quality of food is not up to the mark then it's a bit disappointing.

Been to this place on last Friday. It was a group treat. It is  not a very spacious place, little clumsy. Ambience was good. Staffs were cordial. Service was little slow.Coming to the food menu and quality ( the most important one), we opted for the lunch buffet (399+tax).  Complementary welcome drink was nice. 8 types of starter menu (veg and non veg) were not good not bad kind. Main course was completely disappointing. Too much elaborate menu comprising Chinese and Indian items but lack any taste. Dessert with Gulab jamun, ice cream and darsan were good in quality and taste. I would recommend to improve the taste and quality of food items. Quantity is not everything.

lovely place .. you will feel the warmth of the hospitality just when you enter the restaurant in a hot sunny afternoon and get refreshed by a wet towel to wipe your face .. the background is filled by the music of Kenny G.. well decorated interior and comfortable seats...coming to food part.  they have  good number of items in their menu.  all the items we ordered were superb  in taste ..also they don't make a hole in your pocket.. its properly priced.  and  in the end, we had a wonderful lunch and we came out with smile .. the only point i will make is about their service time .. it should be little less. 
kasturi kebab: 4/5
whole bhetki fish in tandoor: 5/5 ( this simply blew our mind away) 
ckicken lababdar: 4/5

The first time I heard of this restaurant was from an aunt, my mother's friend. She was heaping praises on this establishment. So, we decided to try out some North Indian dishes. It was a time when the restaurant had just been open for a month or two. The food was good. But the prices were extremely pocket-friendly, given the quality of the food. We loved it and ordered (for home delivery) once or twice after that. 

In the last week, I placed an order for a Navratan Korma, Mutton Dakbungalow, and Tandoori Rotis from here. They had raised the prices. But the quality of food was still good. Especially the Navratan Korma, I love their preparation. I have only tried a select few North Indian dishes from there and these were all quite good. And a complimentary "paan" and a little salad comes as a pleasant surprise. 

I would love to try out some other cuisines they offer before my review can be complete. Still, as of now, I would recommend it to my friends.

The first time I ate the biryani I was surprised at how good it was. But second time... I realised it was only the smell that worked not the taste. I don't know whether the second time wasn't actually made well or it's generally like that... It was quite blant.
So I will suggest one thing.. Eat  it while it's hot... Once it cools down and smell goes away... It's shit.

Really nice joint that offers a lot of vareity maintaining the taste at the same time. Being a regular I can certainly vouch that they serve the best daal makhani in whole of salt lake (yes i find it's better that fly kouzina). Although they have a nice  continental and Italian spread in the ala carte​ I always find that their Indian cuisine is a touch above the others. The decor and the service is in sync with the quality of the food they offer. Of their dishes chicken methi malai, lababdar and Tetrazzini deserves special mention. Sadly I never found their Biriyani that appealing. So I mostly stick to butter naan and their lavishing indian delicacies.

Too Over priced compared to the quantity they serve.
We didn't opt for buffet instead we ordered chicken steak in pepper sauce and mutton biriyani combo.
To my disappointment the quantity was very little, even for a single person.
The taste was also average nothing special.
The steak was a little undercooked.
Only thing that I liked was the welcome drink nimbu pani.
Overall not a good experience.

Not worth for the price.
Half cooked food.
They took almost 40minutes to bring main course after starters.

It was my first visit to the place the services are worst to be specially mentioned. They are confused with the sitting arrangements. The place is small and becomes over crowded when it comes to many no of people. Well food if you try might be completely iff the track. They put a bit more sugar to everything. I liked only the salt and pepper chicken and gulab jamun. For the rest I am very disappointed.

Not that good experience here. Starter was good. But the fried rice we ordered had a sort of burnt smell. Though there was a rush that day, they offered to replace the rice by a new one. The fresh one bought was kind of okay, if not great. And the quantity is a bit less. Ambience is appreciable.:)

This Place is located just opposite of city centre 1. Last Sunday I went for a buffet lunch there and my rating will be regarding this only. They were very welcoming and well behaved. There were 5 starters but only fish and chicken kebab was tasty. The main course was bit disappointing and was only Chinese. But then again I think with tax prices are around 450. So it's a value place. Otherwise the restaurant was clean and service was fast.

Went for an office farewell party here based on several recommendations. I am not sure if our timing was bad or the quality of food, but everything was cold. The crispy baby corn was not crispy. The rice was lame. The brownies were not good. Only thing that was ok was the vanilla ice cream. 
Not going there anytime soon!

I have been hearing a lot about this place since last year , now coming to the place , not much spacious but the interior is good. Went there when the live streaming of IPL 2017 was on . Ambience was pretty good. Starters were awesome be it the soup or the chicken lollipops or the crispy baby corn and fish . Main course was not up to the mark. I would request to take care of the food quality of the main course and make some appreciable changes

Ridiculous, horrible, pathetic service and equally the taste of food .. oh my god .. today i visit this restaurant and opted for buffet .. oh dear god it was my big mistake of today i think .. today my taste buds really forgot what is the actual taste of chicken lollipop, mixed chow, mixed rice, sliced chicken in whatever sauce and the beginning chicken sweet corn soup .. the chef should go n learn how to cook food with proper taste and also the management should hire good chef if they want their food joint to succeed in this tough conpetition .. the ambience of the hotel is so so .. but too hot inside .. we requested to  bring down the temp of the ac as we all were sweating .. now coming to food part .. welcome drink none other than our popular sweet and salt lemon water .. then waited for at least 20 mins and they served us chicken sweet corn soup really very very sweet with no trace of chicken and suppose the cook gave sugar in teh soup .. then after long wait came starters chicken lollipop; cold hard no taste n very very very sweet if u have one then u will forget the original taste of chickem lollipop .. then we were served malai kebab so so taste was salty .. then came crispy chicken babycorn again too much sweet .. after that we were served fish fry n chips, fish inside no taste .. this time i asked one of the managers and asked them to prepare food with proper taste  specially lollipop .. then they served us hot n spicy chicken lollipop .. after that we were served chicken salt n peper so so taste .. now comes the most horrible part main course .. then served us peas kachuri n cholar dal oh god they should come and taste shri hari's kachuri n cholar dal .. then mixed chomein no taste, rice no taste.. chicken butter garlic no taste .. sliced chicken in some saice no taste .. n later i found out that they are coming with sliced chicken pieces and just pouring then in sauce that have no taste .. then there were some fish item no taste .. at last came mango chutney just simply awesome taste .. hot gulab jamun awesome and ice cream  with darsana .. with these desserts we filled our hungry stomach .. they claim that they serve 35 items in buffet .. no not at all i think only 15 were served .. so people think 100 times and read other reviews before going to this restaurant .. for me i will necer vist again .. also i talked to their PRO and he said sir try our al-a-carté i think its good.. they are also not sure about their own food taste .. people think before u step into this reataurant ..

This is one of the best places to eat in salt lake area. The staff is awesomely polite and well behaved. They even suggest you if the food you ordered is in excess or not. The food is brilliant, tasty and also the dreasing makes it very appealing.
You gwt an ice towel as soon as you step in from the scorching heat outside. Also they serve a complementary drink. The kababs and also the veggies are good. 

As far as the pricing is concerned , it is very pocket friendly. Kudos to this place

After listening to countless positive reviews from acquaintances, I decided to check out this place and judge for myself what the hype was all about. Now, I can happily say that I wasn't disappointed. 

My review is based on two parameters: the quality of the food and the cost. First of all, let's talk about the food. 
I ordered Dhania Murgh, Kadai Paneer, Masala Kulcha, and Garlic Naan. The star of the spread was undoubtedly Dhania Murgh. It was neither too spicy nor too sweet and yet, it had a very savoury taste. The Paneer dish was good as well. Special points for rich gravy in both the dishes. As for the breads, the Garlic Naan was nicely done. The Kulcha could have been better (I found it a bit dry for my taste) but it was not big an issue.

As for the cost of the food, the pricing is moderate and your pockets remain safe and sound even after a sumptuous feast. 
This is a great restaurant to enjoy the myriad facets of food. Recommended.

Since 2016 is a very popular for their cheapest Buffet lunch offer for 501 per people. 

Located nearby City Center 1 this restaurant is on the 3rd floor of Andromeda building.

Ambiance is very good. Like any fine dine restaurant.

We opted for Buffet even though thy have Ala carte menu. 

The soaked towel is a n8ce touch for refreshing yourself. Kudos for the management for this.

Nimbu pani is the Only welcome drink offered by them.

From the straters Chicken reshmi kebab was brilliant and pepper chicken was good too. Didn't tried the Baby corn. Chicken lollipop was also a nice touch. 
I read some negative review that they dont fill up ghe starters quick but I didn't faced that issue.

After those they served Hot Peas kachuri with Cholar Daal. Both were very good.

There after we tried Fried rice, chilli paneer, fish in garlic butter sauce. All were good but nothing special.

They offered only two desserts Vanilla and strawberry ice cream with darsans and hot gulab jamun.

 Last they gave misti paan..

Since 2016 ,Located in Andromeda building bang opposite Balle Balle Dhaba. Parking is at the petrol pump area or City Centre parking lot.
We tried the buffet spread and it was good.  Ample spread of starters main course and dessert. Pocket pinch is 399 which is pretty good
That said it's a new joint so they still need to work on their hospitality and cleanliness. I found that a bag of sand and construction material next to the kitchen area which seemed unfinished and is open to public view right next to the buffet counter.

Today I with my wife visited the restaurant for the buffet. The experience was very disappointing. There were 3 chicken & 2 vegetable starters. The starters were all served at one go in a platter. It was cold, probably cooked some time back. I have been to several buffets in Kolkata restaurants. They all serve the starters one at a time piping hot from the grill. 
The main course was all Chinese only. There were 2 chicken dishes and one fish in the non veg section. They were all bland, tasteless and seemed to have the same gravy, because all tasted the same. The saving grace was the dessert where they served hot gulab jamun and ice cream.
If you love good food, I would never recommend this pace to you. Being a Sunday, the place was crowded, there was very little space to move around because the layout tried to maximise the number of chairs.
Overall very disappointing.

Ambience is very nice. Staters are yummy.. Specially the kebab. But the main course are big disappointment.. Noodles and rice are good but the side dish are not at all tasty. There are only two flavors of ice cream .. Vanilla and strawberry .. So there are huge scope of improvement in case of desserts. Hot gulab jamun is very soft.

Today we visited this restaurant with our office friends. I had been there once before but today we went for their highly advertised buffet lunch consisting of 35 items. Its a big number so we expected many things. To our utter disappointment the maximum number of items counting salad and welcome drinks was maximum 20, so way less than 35.
The main course consisted of only chinese dishes and no north Indian. So i strongly feel they are cheating people by inviting them for 35 items while in reality they have much less. The price was of course same as the advertisement says 399 plus taxes. they should immidietly change their ad

15 of us visited this place for lunch buffet. The price seemed reasonable.
First the decor. It was very beautifully decorated with dim lights and wall designs and televisions. Music was on and the ambience was relaxing.
They gave us wet towels which was a nice surprise.
Lunch started with a welcome drink - nimboo pani. The chicken soup was not that good. It was ok but the quantity was very less.
In starters there were various dishes - Crispy baby corn , Salt n Pepper chicken , Chicken lollypop , Chicken malai kebab , Paneer masala. They tasted good except the kebab which was quiet bland.
Then came Peas Kachuri , Chholar Daal and Alur dom. These were delicious.
For main course they served Chicken Haka Noodles , Fried rice, Sliced Chicken , Chicken in butter garlic sauce , Fish in Schezwan sauce, Maccher Kalia , Steamed rice , Chicken curry.
For dessert Gulabjamun which tasted more like a Pantua , Icecream of two flavours - vanilla n strawberry and Darshan.
In the end Mishti Paan was served.
While the starters were very good , The main course was not upto the mark with bland and over steamed noodles and rice.

And my main issue was with space. It's a restaurant offering buffet . They should have kept a wider space open for people to move around while getting food. It was almost chaos with everyone standing together in line.
And lastly , every buffet we had been to , there wasn't any time limit for which we could eat. But here they had given booking to another party and asked us to leave (politely) after approx 2 hrs.
2hrs isn't enough time for 15 people to eat a buffet spread properly .

Food tasted awesome and the service was good too. 
Ordered North Indian cuisine.
Badami murg tikka, garlic naan, dal makhni and chicken lababdaar..

All four items were superb.

Looking forward to try their other cuisines and also the buffet.

Opted for a home delivery of mutton duckbunglow.Considering the price Rs 265 for one plate,the quantity is okay.The pieces of meat were small but they were in solid chunks.The gravy has a perfect richness and spiciness to it.They also offer an egg and a potato with the gravy.
Will try the other items soon.

In main course there are variations of Chinese & traditional Bengali items. Deserts are ok. Service of starters are also fine. One drawback is mostly all the items were non spicy which I felt bit odd. Overall worth visit for sure.

If you are looking for a reasonable place to dine at Salt Lake, then Since 2016 is probably a better solution. It's easy to locate and has a nice ambience. There are both Buffet and Ala-Carte menus, although we had opted for the Buffet. The wet towel presented by the staff on the arrival of the guests is quite a unique gesture. The welcome drink is absolutely unpleasant, which tasted more like sugary water than fresh lime soda.
The starters were pretty delicious; the variety was limited but the non-veg starters were filling.
Coming to the main course, the fried rice was under-cooked and bland. The chicken items were comparatively better although the fish item was a disappointment. Not quite satisfied with the main course.
On the contrary, the dessert was a life savior! Literally! I loved the Gajar ka Halwa and Gulab Jamun; very tasty!! The ice cream had only 2 flavors, but that's fine.
The finishing touch was the Paan, which was quite nice.
The staff members are quite courteous and that's their bonus point.
Overall, an okay-ish experience. Hopefully, if they make some changes with their dishes, then they can gain some repetitive visits from customers.

Got to know about this place from Zomato and went there with my best friend last year Aug 2016.. t'was a new restaurant then n we got a warm welcome.. pleasing ambience.. Awesome wall and its decor.. Food quality and its quantity was perfect. For starters we had crispy chilli baby corn. Main course was jeera rice and chicken patiyala.. Though jeera rice was good and light but we were searching for more rice dishes but I guess as it was a new opening options were limited. I hope now there are more rice dishes (I did not check the menu yet in Zomato) . If not I suggest for some fried rice dishes, chicken rice,etc. Chicken patiyala was tasty. For finishing touch we intended some ice cream but since we were so full, we opted for a cold drink. Overall I loved the place. I do intend to go there again. I recommend this place to everyone. Hope this place has got more new options now to try.

I visited this place with my brother and sister for dinner a month ago. I was impressed with the entrance decor. We received a complementary drink. We ordered for chichen pepper salt as starter, makhmali chicken Tikka, chicken biriyani (quantity was good enough), murg Tikka lababdar, kadai chicken, tandoori roti. Food was awesome and the quality also . I enjoyed a lot. And last but not the least very quick service and in order. I am going to visit this place again.

I am not satisfied with this restaurant. We take buffet which cost Rs. 401/- per person (incl. service tax + vat + service charge)

The starter was an OK type, only 3 chicken item. Chicken kebab was good, but chicken lollipop and another chicken item were not good.
In the main course, there were veg and nonveg category. We checked the nonveg but really unhappy. No salt added, no pepper added. The gravy was test less. Also, they failed to refill the buffet in time, so a big queue formed.
I can remember 4 items were there in desserts, Gajar-ka-halwa, Gulabjamoon and 2 types of Amul Ice Cream.

Only thing is good here is the ambiance.

Since 2016... is the name because this restaurant opened in 2016, and I strongly feel it should have opened way before not to deprive of its awesome food and courteous hospitality. I have been here already twice and  may be many a times in the coming days. They serve both Mughlai and Chinese and is a good place to taste both the cuisines under one roof. A special mention of their hospitality and I wish they keep us serving the same way forever. Dont miss  the Gondhoraj Fish Kebab,  Makhmali Chicken Tikka, Chicken Malai Tikka to mention a few.

Food was fantastic. Evening made totally. Lovely ambience, somehow it seemed to me that it could have been a little more attractive if it had been a little more spacious. Otherwise from the idea of cold towel to the welcome drink till the paan, everything was well timed and well served, I'd surely like to go back over there. Way to go team 'Since 2016'

One of the worst Menu with Worst Service. Management has not even a little bit of courtesy to accept their problems. They are so self conscious that they don't even bother to take customer's complaint or feedback about the quality of their Food.

I went their in my friend's birthday treat. We asked for Buffet and we weren't satisfied with the quality. We asked them to either change the meal plan or serve a better quality. Instead of listening they just keep munching their essayed words again and again. At last we asked them for bill of the food which we don't ate then those shameless people instead of having any courtesy presented a full bill with a rebate of 5% as their service charge!

I suggest nobody  should go their as if you are expecting a nice ambience or taste budding foods or have some quality time then this place can't be in your option list.

I would say this is the best restaurant in Salt Lake. The only negative is, that it doesn't serve alcohol. 

Location- Andromeda Building, Right opposite City Centre beside the petrol pump. 

Ambience - Chilled, relaxed settings. Tables are decent distant away from each other. can accommodate big groups. 

Food- Excellent. 
The kebabs are the best and succulent and perfect spices. Gandharaj Fish, Cheese Mushroom Kebab, and the chicken kebab(with bone) the name eludes me now are must try. 

main course - Daal makhani is delicious. Garlic naan and Navaratan Korma are good. 
The chicken patiala is absolutely delicious. Must order. The labadar chicken is a bit too oily for my liking. 

The chicken pasta in white sauce is so delicious. So Is the bhekti in lemon sauce !!! It is must try! The continental dishes are good. 

I haven't tried the Chinese menu or the desserts yet. 

servers - Very friendly and not overbearing. The serve welcome drinks (complimentary)

Value For money - YES!

Would I recommend - 5/5.

Happy saraswati puja to all...
This restaurant is situated just opposite the city centre mall salt lake. We went for the lunch buffet @399 rs at near about 2.30 p.m... Nice ambience.. Food is very good.. Many items as no one can eat all of these. Stuffs are very friendly.. Over all a nice experience...

Well, a long night with endless work and an empty hungry tummy don’t quite go hand in hand. So, for the 1st time ordered food through Swiggy app from this restaurant – about which had heard positive reviews from word-of-the-mouth and of course Zomato!

Thy name suggests that they have been in business “SINCE 2016” – but I could taste their stuff only today in 2017! I ordered a Veg Kadhai Paneer and a couple of plain naans for office delivery. Nice to see a timely delivery – just 50 odd minutes (considering that they are based @ Sector 1, City Center Saltlake - quite afar from my workplace at Sector 5).

Packing was fine, so was food presentation – you can keep staring that paneer for hours and yet she won’t mind! The onion skins, the capsicum pieces and the tomato gravy do impart it a pout (make it beautiful)!

Taste was equivalent – if not better than the presentation. What reduced my joy was the naans which became chewy with efflux of time – for which these guys can’t be taken to ransom, as this was just an office delivery and not a dine-in!

Prices are pretty high – a 318 rupee bill for the above might be a deterrent for frequent visits to this place.

Overall, a good experience – looking forward to their Rs. 399/- + Taxes buffet – comprising 35 items!

This place fine.. But the behaviour of the manager is very very odd... I and five of my friends went there on 26th Jan to avail the Rs 399 lunch buffet.. As I called the restaurant authority to get know of the timings.. They told me that We can avail offer whenever we can come, but by 4:30.. So we were told, we went there at 4:10.. 
The most tragic part is the next... The manager came to us and informed us that we will not be able to avail the offer as they will all wrap up by 4:30... Them my question to since 2016 that"WHY THE HELL YOU GUYS WRITE THE TIMINGS TO BE FROM 12-4:30 PM ???!!!""
 All this holy shit..!!

Since 2016 is located just opposite to City Centre 1,Salt Lake.The ambience of the place is beautiful,especially the lighting and decoration at the entrance.The music ramped up the surroundings even better.

We received a very warm welcome.They gave us a wet napkin and a refreshing drink to freshen up.

We opted for the 35 course buffet at Rs. 399,which rounds up to about Rs. 500 including the taxes.

Coming to the food :

Starters -

▪ Chicken Soup 

▪ Chicken Reshmi Kebab 

▪ Chicken Lollipop 
 
▪ Paneer Tikka 

All were amazing.The chicken lollipop can be improved a bit though.We were half full with the starters only.There were other veg starters too which we did not take.

Main Course -

The main course had a variety of chicken and fish preparation from both chinese and north indian cuisines.Special mention goes to the fried rice,chilli fish(Chinese Cuisine) and kasha mangsho(North Indian Cuisine).They can improve a bit on the chinese chicken preparations.

Desserts -

▪Vanilla Ice Cream

▪ Chocolate Ice Cream 

▪ Gulaab Jamun 

Loved the gulaab jamun which was of the perfect temperature. 

The staffs were courteous and served us to their best.

Overall,it was a pleasant experience. 😊😊

Went on 31.12.2016 for lunch treat from a frnd on her birthday.
We thought of going for ala-carte after reading great reviews but then settled for buffet.
It was 35 course buffet for 399 without tax with tax which rounds out to be around 500.
I don't knw about why the ratings are so low. But I really had a great time.
The ambiance is great.
The staff are super gud.
They guide u , help u with serving what u want on your table so that u don't have to get up . Whatever finished and we wanted they may have taken a 5-10 min extra but it was served.
So buffet exp get a lot better here itself.
Now coming to the food
Starter was gud be a veg or non veg. Fried wantons, paneer tikka and Baby corn.
Special mention is the chicken malai kabaab and the pepper chicken. I was half full with the starter itself.
Chicken lollypop and baby corn needs to made better.

The fried rice the chowmin was properly made. Fish in green sauce was nice . Fish was soft. Chicken kasha was nice too. Roti was gud had it with change dalna .. .....another great dish.
Then the Bengali dishes was gud too. There was cholar daal. Beguni, jhuri alu bhaja, chilly paneer.

Desert option was less
Two flavour ice cream
Vanila and strawberry
But it was made up by the tender and hot gulab jamuns and gajar ka halwa.

I have had been through bad buffet experience. They have places to improve namely chicken lollypop, baby corn. And yes the welcome drink is just barir lebu chinir jol.
But I have no complaints for the rest.
I would have given a 4pt BUT A 5 is coz of the WARM WELCOME OF THE STAFF AND HOW THEY HELPED.

Tried this restaurant on new year eve dinner as all others were packed full. Our first time experience was overall good. The staffs were courteous, however their service was a bit slow. Mughlai items tasted way better than their Chinese ones. Chicken biryani was hot and freshly served. Ambience was good but the music was too loud for a family dinner. We requested to lower the volume but nobody did so..

The ambiance is good and prices are affordable. Would love to see more desert and mock-tails in future. Thank you SINCE 2016.

If you are anywhere close to City Center 1 this is one of the best places to dine out. I would not have discovered the place without Zomato as it is not visible from the Mall. It's affordable and the ambience is breathtaking. Outside of hotels you don't really see waterfalls and flowers in the lobby. The service is quick and the waiters are well behaved. Good place for larger groups as well.

However the dish didn't taste as good as the first time when we ordered for one more plate again. The chicken tandoori was definitely tasty. The singapore rice noodles were bland. The fresh lime soda was ok. Staff is cordial. Decor is nice. However, the passage leading to the washroom can be and should be kept in a better manner.all in all, a simple place and nothing to go gaga on.

I went with my family on Nabami for dinner. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. Meanwhile we were served a complimentary welcome drink. The gesture was nice. After ordering, we were not made to wait for a long time. We had Fish Amritsari and Tandoori Chicken for starters. Both were lovely. Then we had Veg Pulao, Fried Chicken Chowmein and Mutton Dugbungalow. The chowmein was loaded with boiled veggies, making it a wholesome meal. Coming to the desserts we had Brownie with Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Butterscotch ice cream. Unfortunately we had to wait a bit for the Gulab Jamun since the staff made a mistake by serving it to a wrong table. Otherwise,  we had a delightful experience. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Salt Lake area.

I went to 'Since 2016' on a Nabami night. And I was really impressed with the way they handled the peak hour rush. There were complimentary drinks while we sat in the queue. Once inside the hospitality was warm and polite. Now coming to the food.. We had mostly Chinese.. Which were very well prepared. The lambs were tender and well cooked. They would probably want to look into their soup section a bit.. But apart from that.. I love it.. I would like to visit this place more for their continental and Indian preparations... But so far.. So good.

I had a wonderful time at this restaurant.  Food was good and the service is even better here. Even during time of Durga puja service was really good.   
Just as you enter they greet u with the welcome drinks and cold towels.  I ordered my food and even though the restaurant was full I got good tasty food in just 15-20 minutes. After dinner they gave finger bowl with rose petals in it, which was a good touch and at last a good Meetha pan. Summing it all,  everything was fine except for desert I ordered- brownie with vanilla ice cream,  brownie was a bit hard and not that warm as it should be.

I went to 'Since 2016' on a Nabami night. And I was really impressed with the way they handled the peak hour rush. There were complimentary drinks while we sat in the queue. Once inside the hospitality was warm and polite. Now coming to the food.. We had mostly Chinese.. Which were very well prepared. The lambs were tender and well cooked. They would probably want to look into their soup section a bit.. But apart from that.. I love it.. I would like to visit this place more for their continental and Indian preparations... But so far.. So good.

I had a wonderful time at this restaurant.  Food was good and the service is even better here. Even during time of Durga puja service was really good.   
Just as you enter they greet u with the welcome drinks and cold towels.  I ordered my food and even though the restaurant was full I got good tasty food in just 15-20 minutes. After dinner they gave finger bowl with rose petals in it, which was a good touch and at last a good Meetha pan. Summing it all,  everything was fine except for desert I ordered- brownie with vanilla ice cream,  brownie was a bit hard and not that warm as it should be.

Nice ambiance, great food, I have tried their Sunday lunch buffet which serves too many food one can devour in a single seating :P fish was excellent as well as very light chicken curry which i like to eat. The staff was very friendly like you don't have to go to the buffet counter each time just ask them and they'll serve whatever you want. Overall experience was nice, will come back for sure.

A very good place to visit. Very nice food, good behaved and properly dressed staff.
Food quality and quantity was also very good for the price. A place which i would love to visit again.

But a few cons, which i would expect would be rectified quickly.
1st we had to call the waiter and ask for everything, everytime, like water, finger bowl, tissue paper, bill etc etc.. would love it if they could just provide these on time, without the need for calling them and asking for it all the time.
2nd the more serious one. Same thing happened to us, and the people sitting next to us on the other table also. They made a wrong bill. Added extra items to the bill. I know during pujas they are in a rush situation. But making mistakes on the bill is a huge setback.
But they were really good. They were eager to hear the negative points too, which was very good of them.
Hope will be able to give a 5star the next time i visit.
Kudos to you guys.....

0.5 cut for the delays and having to call again and again for water etc. And 1.0 cut for the error in bills that happened....

Hope this place gives me a chance to give 5star next time. Cause i loved it otherwise.

2nd visit: Visited there again. This time during off season. They rectified all the points that i had mentioned. Awesome place. Will visit again.....
Updating my rating as well......

Nice ambience and food. I went there in a Saptami afternoon comparatively less crowded than other places.  Some items are unique and overall food quality is good even though it was puja time. Staffs are courteous and helpful.  Yes this is the first time may he they are managing puja crowd so little bit disorganised but that is OK.  Overall experience is good.

Well .... Newly opened... In durga puja, we have got seat for 6 people, just when we reached. Then they served us welcome drink. 

We placed the order and it was on the table with in 10  - 15 mins. We ordered fish fry, veg polao, mutton bhuna, mutton dak banglo, cheese naan. 

Each and every preparation was awesome. Well cooked mutton. Real bhetki fish fry. 

Lastly we all requested for another glass of welcome drink. They provided that also. 

I'm impressed. 

Please visit the place at least once for experience.

Very nice place with excellent and one of the best services and hospitality. After ordering the food it arrived within 3/4 minutes. We had Chicken Patiyala which is their speciality, Kosha Mangsho, tandoori roti, salad and hot gulab jamun for dessert. Food was extremely delicious, sp. the mutton which reminded me of the ones made by Golbari. The gulab jamun was piping hot enough to burn one's tongue (which it did to mine!) but sweet and syrupy and tasteful. We were also served complimentary non-alcoholic drinks for refreshment in the beginning and paan at the end.
Ambiance and decor too is pretty decent and fresh, with wallpapered walls, artificial potted flowers etc. Since we visited it during the Pujo the rhythmic sound of "dhak" was being played in the backdrop.
Overall very satisfactory experience with good hearty delicacies.

Opposite to City Centre 1, this is a new restaurant with a nice ambience and a pleasing decor, added to a easily accessible location. But this is as far as the good thing went for our visit to Since 2016.

We went for an office lunch, a group of 75 people - which the management confirmed would be able to accommodate. We had arranged a customized buffet as the one offered did not have adequate dishes. Also, all the dishes were to be served on table since there isn't enough space for a counter that can serve these many people. These were discussed two days prior to the lunch and we visited the restaurant as well.

All the four starters, the chicken, crispy noodles, baby corn and especially the fish were spicy beyond tolerance levels. I could see most of the people sweating and red faced from the hotness. Not to mention, it took about an hour for all the 8 people from my table to get each of the starters at least once. The welcome drink, coke/Sprite was served after asking 4 times - probably they ran out of glasses. And here's the cherry on the topping - when we asked for another round of baby corns, the floor manager (?) said he would like to start serving the main course now! They gave us the baby corns later though.

Mains were a disaster...a table was served noodles and daal and was left unattended thereafter. We were asked to get the food ourselves even though we had made the arrangement earlier - they counter simply doesn't have enough space for 10 people, forget 30 at a time. There was a power cut and we never saw the lights again. To add to the stifling temperature, the smoke from the kitchens started filling the main restaurant. We had hardly started with the main course, but had to leave the place after some heated exchange of words with the floor manager, who insisted that he can't do anything since power backup is the building admin's responsibility. We did not agree on paying the full amount and left.

All in all, a ruined lunch, due to power failure (which is not actually the restaurant's fault but they didn't do anything for 30+ mins), pathetic service and very mediocre food. Avoid if you're going in large groups - not sure about individual patrons or smaller groups.

You have many varieties in menu and everything priced reasonably . Ambiance too is great. They have a setup of buffet too but not sure if it has started or not

We cannot believe a restaurant  can be so unprofessional. There was power cut and that prolonged for more than half an hour leading people to choke. Waiters will not respond to you and even soft drinks will not be served even after asking for 5 times. We had to leave the place in between the meal as it was difficult to breathe. They were cooking with mobile flash lights.

Prices are also in line with the standard rates at similar place. 
This is definitely a strong option if you are thinking a meal in Salt Lake area.

I visited the place for the very first time. This place is situated just opposite of city centre. Very well decorated place and stuffs are very well behaved. In hospitality and  customer attention they deserve five star. Now coming to the food item. They provide complementary drinks which was good. We ordered since 2016 special mocktail , their special tandori kabab, murgh biryani and chicken patiala. Their special mocktail was just awesome. Must try item. Kabab was also good and tasty. Murgh biryani was also good and different from typical arsalan or aminia types. Chicken patiala is a must try dish . It was very tasty and with biryani it was just perfect. I will definitely visit this place again. They have perfect food, ambience and decor.

I have been to this place few days back. Its just opposite to City Centre in the Andromedia Buliding. What surprised me was after exiting from the lift, the nice décor that lead to the restaurant. Good ambience and food. Really appreciate their hospitality with face towel and drinks once customer visits in. Overall, a great dine-out place in Saltlake.

Excellence and Perfection, they are master at. Awesome decoration like any other fine dine restaurants. 5 star hospitality and finger licking taste. All total a nice place to have dinner/lunch with family or Friends.
The restaurant is situated just opposite to city centre 1 'Bata' showroom, at the third floor of the building. Entrance is beautifully decorated with lamps at the both side of the passage parallely. The environment is calm and soothing. At the very moment we took our seat's we were served with complimentary drink and they follow the Japanese tradition "oshibori" and offer wet towels for hand sanitising or depending on the weather people may clean their faces too.
Staffs are courteous and well behaved.
Foods were tasty, we ordered-
*Since 2016 tandoori murgh,Chicken were juicy and tender, and was properly marinated was not over spicy.
*Peas Pulao, this was good too else than the cashew's which were a bit over fried.
*Mutton Dukbanglow, the best one among all the dishes we ordered. Must try for mutton lovers.
*Fish Tikka Masala, evn fish item was also tasty n the fish was itself tasty, else than the preparation.
*Green salad
*fresh lime soda...
And lastly was served wit paan.
Even we took parcel of tandoori roti and navaratna korma, even the taste of navaratna was good. And the food was packed accurately.
Surely will visit again and I also suggest you all to visit as well. 

2nd visit....

As it was Mahalaya, we went for family lunch. The hospitality was excellent like the first visit. Service and taste of food was as good as I experienced at my previous visit.

We ordered..
*Since 2016 tandoori murgh..which was juicy, tender and tasty.
*Peas Pulao..
*Tawa wala dhingri...a mushroom preparation on red gravy and a bit spicy. It taste's good.
*Chingri malai curry, an authentic preparation of bengali malai curry. 
*Dhania Murgh, a boneless chicken preparation on white gravy with essence of coriander leaves. 
*fresh lime soda, again it was not upto the mark. 
*darshan with vanilla ice cream.

One of the most pathetic buffet ever eaten. We went there as a group of 11 people after getting some standard reviews from collegues and freinds as this is the new place with nice decor. We are not surprised with the ambience but the food left a lot to be desired. Priced 459 all inclusive (although S tax 5% extra), this place is waste of money. Only one stinky fish starter and two bald non veg in main course. Items are chosen without having a brain where you end up having jeera rice with white sauce coated chicken 😖. Service and ambience is as expected. Never recommend, never go for buffet.

Since 2016 is a fairly new eatery near City centre. I have not visited this place till now but I recently ordered food from here. It was around 11 o clock and all other restaurants refrained from taking any orders when I tried to give this place a shot. They immediately took our orders and promised to deliver within 45 mins. The food was delivered to us within 30 min and the food was hot and tasty. We had ordered a mutton  dakbanglow which was extremely tasty and full of flavours. The management is extremely good as they even called us up to ask how the food tasted and whether it reached our place at the right time. It was an extremely sweet gesture. Would surely visit this place soon.:)

Okay! So. This place was never in my card, but then I had to visit due to my sister's constant praising about this place. So we dropped there finally. Decoration was wonderful. I really liked that nice simple decoration along with that dim lightning pattern which was so much more attractive. The place is short but the seats are reasonably well spaced. And thus place will never disappoint you when it comes to food. 
We opted for buffet which was for just 459 INR.( Though I heard it was for 333).  We were welcomed by a broad smile by the waiters. And then came a wet cinnamon scented towel and an amazing complementary drink. I reaaally  liked that drink. We had chicken sweet corn soup and a wok fish preparation along with crispy chilli baby corn in our starters. And everything was so delicious. Staffs were warm and  service was quick.Then for our main course we had Crispy noodle salad, a wonderful must try preparation of Mix Vegetable, Kashmiri Aloo Dum along with Jera Rice,and Yellow Dal, Butter Nun matched with Chicken in Garlic and Butter sauce which tasted delicious. And Veg Hakka noodles with a Paneer Prepation. Then for our dessert part, we had two Gulabjamuns which tasted devine along with Kachaa Aamer Chatni and roasted papad. Last but not the least Vanilla Ice cream. Then came our paan whichbi really needed at that time. (Lol).  
Disappointment- There were too less variations of non-veg items in buffet. 
Overall this place is really nice and i'm dropping by here for another buffet lunch really soon!

But Roasted Chicken ceaser salad and Grilled chicken Supreme was delicious.. The chocolate brownie with icecream was amazing as usual. Overall a very good experience. Would visit again.

Great food at reasonable prices but lack of a premium feel sums up the restaurant for me.

Located near city centre in salt lake, the corridor and lead up to the restaurant reduce the expectations. The decor inside is better yet average. The restaurant is small but seats are reasonably well spaced. Staff are warm and service is quick.

Coming to food, there is a long menu and prices are very reasonable , moreso considering the quality of food. I tried their manchow soup that was good. Spaghetti alio olio was excellent served with a nice garlic bread. However peas pulao was average as it was loaded with dry fruits which I hated. We were greeted with a welcome drink that was nice and were served nice sweet paan to end. Honestly I loved these small gestures which aren't so common. 

Overall it's a great place to dine if one could compromise on the ambiance to an extent !

We dropped in at Since 2016 for the lunch buffet. The interiors of this newly opened restaurant near city centre are nicely done, with walls of a vibrant yellow. On our arrival we were served with a welcome drink which however failed to please my taste buds. The menu of the buffet is not quite out of the ordinary, and features a veg soup, crispy baby corn, schezwan fish, naan, mixed veg, daal makhani, veg hakka noodles, veg fried rice and chilli chicken gravy. The dessert section had daarsan and chocolate brownie alongside vanilla ice-cream. The absence of chocolate syrup was strongly felt. The only thing that could make us happy was the quantity, because hello, it's unlimited! ;)

Located right opposite to city centre, saltlake, a newly opened restaurant that serves both Chinese and North Indian delicacies.
The entrance of the restaurant is well decorated and was welcomed warmly by the staffs.
Quantity and quality of food served is very good.
A nice place for gatherings.
Must try: chicken patiala. 
Happy Eating :)

Ok,so me along wid 2 of my sisters went to Since 2016 a week ago for lunch..
We were in a hurry as we had only 50mins for a show to begin..
The waiters here greeted us with a broad smile & we replied them with a even broader smile. 😂😁  hee hee..
The decor & the ambience of the restro is mind-blowing.
They gave us wet towels and one of the staff members even pulled the chair for us and made sure that we sat comfortably.
We were served refreshing drinks(mango smoothie) that was sooo soo good..
Coming to the food
For starters We ordered Makhmali Chicken Tikka which was a bit under cooked & have mentioned that in the feedback form too..
For main course we chose Dum Ke Chicken Biriyani & Murg Tikka Lababdar(Since 2016 special) these were just too delicious..
And after we finished having our lunch we were given finger bowl which had rose petals & gondhoraj lebu.. The smell.. 😊 mmm..

Atlast but not the least,paan was served.. Aah! That was the best treat..
I have given 4ratings for the starters..
Staffs were very much courteous..

The perfect restaurant if you are throwing a birthday party, Since 2016 lures people with the lunch buffet priced at Rs. 333/- inclusive of all taxes.
The brightly-lit restaurant's decor and hospitality were top notch. 
We were greeted with a welcome drink and cold towels were provided before the meal. Though the welcome drink left a weird aftertaste, the innovative style was much appreciated.
Coming to the buffet:
1) Crispy noodle salad : It tasted wonderful though it had gone a bit cold.
2) Soup - The chicken soup was thin and watered down. 
3) Starters:
• Crispy chilli babycorn - 'Crispy' being a misnomer.
• Schezwan fish - The fish was not perfectly cooked. 
4) Mains :
• Chicken hakka noodles and chicken fried rice
• Chilli chicken and schezwan paneer
                     - The grain items came with a vegetarian variant too. The dishes were extremely ordinary and a bit bland.
5) Desserts - 
• Darsaan and Ice cream - Only a single flavour of ice cream was kept at a time though the waiters kept on changing it on a half-hour basis. 
• Brownies - The nut-stuffed brownies were probably the best part of the buffet.

Overall, it was a pretty unimpressive meal. Having said that, you would be hard-pressed to get such a buffet for the same price in any other restaurant. If you are looking to gorge on a lot of food without spending much, this place is perfect for you.

The hospitality was good at first .they gave us wet towels and soft drinks as we came.then we order JALAPEÑOS as starter and moved to buffet.the starter was awesome(great) and buffet starters like baby corn and fish fry were awesome but the main course was pathetic. Fried rice was worse and the chicken was smelly.and at last we were given brownies which were over cooked(burned)wid no sweetness at all.

The decor is top notch and the service is good. 
Even though the buffet didn't have much variety of options, the food was OK and worth the price.

Had seen many hoarding in salt lake about their buffet meal all inclusive 333,the name itself attracted us to this restaurant which is just opposite the city centre1 lane nearby Kalyan jewellers inside the Andromeda building,not a very difficult place to find,there is a problem with parking as you hav to park inside the city centre complex and come all the way walking to this restaurant.
It is small restaurant with a seating capacity o@f 60 people to the max,the ambience could b worked out better.
We opted for their famous buffet,a Chinese buffet all inclusive @ 333,the soup and the starter was just awesome but the side dish and its gravy was a disaster,h ad to eat the fried rice and noodles with just the starter and sauce,i loved their Chinese salad

The hot buffet in town. Located just opposite of CC1 Bata. They are trying promotion by Rs.333 buffet (incl tax) and its a perfect. Ambience and service is good , not bad not excellent. So does the food quality. But Nowhere in town you'll find that much standard Chicken soup , noodle salad , veg/chicken rice n noodle , baby corn , schezwan fish and a chicken dish .. also mentionable desert.They'll give you a welcome drink .. nothing but just 7up but in the end they'll provide paan .. that'll make your meal complete. Its a must go. But for the buffet only .. At least for now.

Horrible experience. The food quality and taste isn't upto the mark. Worst, there were glass particles inside the food. When we complained, manager just said 'its a mistake'. Wth!!!
Staff behaviour isn't right. We requested for an extra ketchup, and the waiter mentioned that they can't provide only 1 ketchup in 1 table...
Lastly, when I went to make a payment, I was told, that they accept American express credit cards for A La Carte, but not for buffet...extremely ridicoulous.
Lastly, when we asked for a discount, manager mentioned that the best he could do, is charge for 9 plates instead of 10 (we were a group of 10)
Worst dining experience of my life. Won't ever go, and will advise everyone to avoid going to this restaurant

* What : A very good continental food along with Indian.
* Where : Just opposite City Center 1 Bata.
* When : Sunday night dinner.
* Pocket Pinch : Normal rate,nothing hi-fi.

* Ambience : Really nice. spacious inside,neat and clean and a splendid touch of modern aristrocracy. Perfect restaurant ambience. (rating 10 on 10)


* Food : 1. We had started with CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB and instantly I liked it for its smoothness and beautiful taste. (rating 9 on 10)
               2. CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA was not that very special,it was bit spicey I must say. (6 on 10)
               3. Mutton lovers must try BHOONA GOHST, it was unique,so elegantly cooked and quantity was also enough. (10 on 10)
               4. MUTTON DUG BUNGLOW was a sad story here,total wastage of money. ( 5 on 10)
                5. SPHAGETTI PASTA WITH ALFREDO SAUCE (served with garlic bread for free) was also I liked best here. Real taste of Italian. (9 on 10)
               6. Mocktails were all good exception blue lagoon. (don't take blue lagoon ever)

* Management : They always get 10 on 10 for their grand welcome when you enter to their grand see off when you are going out.

* Why recommended : As a new multicuisine restaurant they have already won the hearts of food lovers. Normally they have something special. So go and experience it.

This place is near city centre1..I had two  occasions to celebrate and wanted to have a good experience and then basis a reference I decided to go..
The entrance was very nicely put up ..the place is nicely laid and they serve you coldrink and wet towel to welcome you..
We had ordered crispy chili baby corn and manchow soup for starters.
Main course was Kadai paneer, dal makhani and sabz jhal frezi along with garlic nan masala kulcha and tandoori for breads..
All in all the food was good but it was a bit more sweet than usual..
The best thing was their hospitality..
They are warm polite and very courteous.
To end with we was served with PAN which added to the experience and I give them a plus for this...
I had a great experience and would love to visit again...

Visited the place for its buffet.  At 333 all inclusive this is a real value for money deal.  The quality is as good as you can get at this price,  i.e not authentic chinese but good to taste.  They dont have many items on the list but enough.  In non veg they had a crispy fish starter,  chicken soup, chicken noodles,  chicken fried rice,  gravy chilli chicken and dessert.  For this price i can go there again.  And the ambience is a 4, and service a 4.

Hi friends..I tried the lunch buffet at this place today.It is reasonably priced at Rs 333 only.This was what allured us try it out on a weekday during office hours.The food was quite disappointing.We had tried the ala carte indian menu earlier and some of the kebabs were extraordinary.The buffet however did not meet our expectations.Starters included crispy babycorn,and chicken sweet corn soup. Main course had haka noodles fried rice and szechuan fish and chilly chicken and paneer. Ice cream brownie and darsaan was on the dessert menu.The quality of the fish was not up to the mark.The crispy babycorn was cold and not at all crispy.I did not find any chicken in the soup.The chow and rice was okay.It was unexpected because 2 Months back we had had kebabs and a gandharaj lemon flavored fish here which were amazing

Since 2016.. it was the clever name that got us attracted to this place and that it is conveniently located.The ambience is nice and welcoming and so is the welcome by the servers there. We went during the Mango season and the welcome drink Aam panna was to die for. The wet towel wipes and all only raise your expectations of the place till the food comes and you keep wo dering whether this will be good or not. We returned our hot n sour soups, some of the non veg items were good and some were not. It was quite a random experience. But then the nice paans in the box was quite a delight.Suggestig this place only if you have nowhere else to go and want to try a new place that serves quite a variety!

Awesome buffet.. Just loved it... In such a high rising market, u guys really know how to get us attracted with d perfect blend of lovely hygienic food and with a very easy pocket pinch... But standards of certain items must be looked into with proper care...
I am suggesting this so that foodies/food critics can never say, "according to their pocket friendly courtesy deir quality is low.." U shud try to keep dese two qualities parallel to each other.....
THE AMBIENCE, THE FRESHNERS, WELCOME DRINKS ARE THE BEST PART OF YOUR RESTAURANTS.... you guys know how to greet food lovers..
All d best fr ur future... Gonna visit again..

The most easy to locate restaurant.. Just opposite to cc1 in vasan eye care building. The decoration of the restaurant is very nice. As soon as we entered we were welcomed with a glass of cold drink. We opted for the buffet.. The starters comprised of chicken corn soup, crispy noodle salad and schezwan dry fish.. The soup tasted good also the salad was fantastic. In the main course we had chicken fried rice, chicken haka noodles and chilly chicken.. Both the rice and the chilly chicken were horrible.. Only the noodle was a bit edible.. Then we moved on to the dessert section in which we had darshan brownies and ice cream.. I must admit the dessert section is the most wonderful among the others.. Only the dessert part doesn't disaapoints you. So just for Rs. 333 we had a lot. Overall good worth trying once..

After a long time me and my elder brother went to a very good and awesome restaurant.
Since 2016's wonderful buffet system gave us a little bit of goodness. When we entered in this,we are really shocked. Their decoration is very nice and pretty. We took some selfies at there. Then we moved towards the restaurant.
Their welcoming was so good. They gave us a hand cleaner hanky and a glass of cold drinks for free. We ordered for a buffet lunch. There was 5 main courses in the Non-Veg(Egg rice,Chicken Noodles,two fish's item and chicken soup)side and also 5 in Veg side(Veg rice,Crispy chilly baby corn,salad,and some more...) Their all foods are very tasty and delicious. Then we ate desserts like Brownies,darshan and ice cream. At last after a huge lunch. They gave us two "PAN(betel leavs)" s ...this is also very tasty.

Writing this review exactly after a week of visiting the place. The Restaurant is located in the same building of Vasan eye care, Opposite of CC1. Before going I had called them up to know what was the menu on that particular day.. They explained exactly the same as I read on Zomato.. So me and my friend were very excited to go there and have so many delicious foods at just Rs333 each.. As we entered the place we found that the decoration of the restaurant was wonderful.. After that a waiter came and gave us a soaked towel to cleanse our hands.. That was very welcoming.. Then we were served with 2 glasses of coke(which was complementary).. Well, then we took our plates and went to check out the starters.. We took a chicken sweet corn soup, a fish starter and crispy baby corn.. but there was no chicken starter.. As we asked one of the waiters  about the chicken starter, he said it was not available.. Disappointment started.. In starters, the soup was very light and tasty, the preparation of baby corn was also great, but the fish item was not up to the mark, may be for over frying.. Then came the main course.. There were chicken noodles, egg fried rice, and only a chicken item.. No fish.. when we asked then about the fish item in the main course they as usual replied NOT AVAILABLE.. chicken noodle was so so,  fried rice was horrible as the rice was not boiled properly.. chicken item was good.. but one thing I have to mention that we tried a dish of paneer from veg section and it tasted awesome!! Then we jumped on to the dessert section and the dessert section was amazing I must say.. There were darshan, brownies and vanilla ice cream.. all of them tasted Wow!! Only for the dessert section I'm giving it 3 rating.. At last they served us a paan which was good..  I know that they are serving so many things at just Rs333(all inclusive ), but what is the use of serving so many things if they do not taste good??  And I think as days pass on,  a restaurant should increase its goodwill and the variety of food..at least it should keep its spread of items the same.. but in case of since 2016, the variety and the quality of food both have fallen down.. I'm not at all happy with my experience in since 2016..  They decorated everything so nicely but what should have been decorated the most, the quality of food was dim..

After trying out their lunch buffet, the only reason i m giving this place a better rating is because of the staff behavior and ambience. Coming to the food - starters were chicken sweetcorn soup(pretty good), crispy babycorn( not crispy and had too much coating), chilli fish dry (overcooked dry fish with thick coating). For main course there was chicken fried rice( decent), chicken noodle (tasted decent but had some dried chewy noodles in between), 'chilli chicken' (if u can even call it that). I dont understand how can someone go so wrong with these basic indochinese dishes. Anyway the dessert was saviour. Even though the brownie was a tad bit dry, the icecream and darshan makes up for it. The staffs are extremely polite. On arrival they serve wet towel n complimntry drink. Even though i didnt have much expectation from a buffet priced at 333/- but the food were hardly edible. Staffs were sincere enough to ask for a feedback and apologised for dissapointing. Ended with a nice mistipan.

I am so surprised by this restaurant. They offer a fairly good buffet spread at rock bottom prices. I wonder how long would they be able to continue with this promotional price. Its a bare 333 inr tax inclusive! 
The menu came with salad, veg and non veg soup, two veg starters and two non veg starters, chicken fried rice and veg fried rice, chicken chowmein and veg chowmein, two veg side dishes and two non veg side dishes. In desserts it offered ice cream, darsan and brownie. It also had pan to end with and complimentary soft drinks to start with. Unbelievable, yet true, at this price point, they were tasty and cheap and hygienic.

I recently went there with my family and opted for the lunch buffet. The decoration of the place is beautiful. However the place was very small, and the management had a hard time trying to cope with the large turnout(since it was a holiday). They were taking an unnaturally long time to refill the dishes. Hence the waiting part was a little annoying.

Coming to the food, we were served a cold drink first (coke or pepsi or thums up maybe). There were chicken sweet corn and veg sweet corn soup. I tried only the former and it was good enough. For starters there were crispy chilli babycorn, chilli paneer, schezwan fried fish and chicken salt and pepper. The babycorn was very crispy; the paneer was average; the fish was crispy too, but average; the chicken was simply delicious! Now coming to the main course, the chicken hakka noodles tasted pretty good, it also had a slight smoky flavour which I really liked. The veg-manchurian was also quite good, even though I have tasted better. The fish in coriander sauce was also different and good. The chilli chicken was average. For dessert there was honey-sesame darsan, vanilla ice-cream and chocolate brownies. The brownies were dry but when accompanied by ice-cream, it hardly matters. They also served us paan in the end. Even though it doesn't match with the rest of the food, I have nothing to complain about because I love a well-made paan.

Overall I really liked the place. The variety and quantity of food that they are serving for the nominal price of rupees 333 is worthy of an applause. Compared to the buffet served by other well-known Chinese restaurants, I think Since 2016 was much better food-wise and you will get more than your money's worth. I will absolutely recommend this place.

A Thumbs Up to this new kid on the block. Hospitality and ambience is awesome. While waiting, I was offered complimentary drinks and wet towel. The same was repeated when we got the table. Now coming to food, quality was good, but not the best. While the chicken preparations were quite good, but the fish items were a bit smelly. The Crispy Noodles Salad deserves a big thumbs up and is recommended to everyone visiting this restaurant. Overall, the rice preparation was much better than the noodles (I had chicken fried rice, chicken noodles and veg noodles). The Sweet Lime (You get by paying extra) was quite refreshing as well. Overall, it was good with a few letdowns. First, the Crispy Baby Corn Dry and Fried Paneer Dry were over, but were not refilled. Second, the dessert (Vanilla Ice cream, Brownie and Darshan) didn't have chocolate sauce in the offering. But with tag price of only 333 per head, its a bet well taken, and recommended to Zomato users.

Leave aside it's superior ambience and extremely friendly staffs, the restaurant is a treat for food  lovers. The Buffet Spread is simply amazing. For a price tag of 333 INR all inclusive, the spread is definitely true value for money. Every item in the spread promises superiority in terms of quality and taste. However, the Buffet Spread is available only for Lunch, from Monday to Friday. Definitely worth a try!!!

Equally bad food and service in the lunch buffet. The refilling system of the food is very poor and the food is tasteless. Ala carte is better in comparison to the buffet.

Went there for lunch last Sunday. We were around 10 people. Ambiance is descent though the place is bit cramped for space. They have a descent selection of vegetarian items though this place is primarily for non vegetarian food. We ordered vegetarian food and we're not disappointed. The starters like American corn, tandoori also were very good. The main course items like Dal & Mix veg were nicely prepared and tasted good. Only problem was the Malai Kofta which was very sweet. The breads were descent but Tandoori Roti was a bit more cooked. Items were reasonably priced given the quantity and quality. Staff courteous and service good. Overall a good dining experience.

The decoration is top notch... the entrance was so colorfully done also the touches of light making it royal...
The staffs are very courteous and friendly...
We didn't dine in their opted for take away... but will surely experience the dine in when possible in future...
They offered us wet rolls for refreshment along with a tangy aam panna sorbot... I liked their way of greeting there guests...
Coming to the food we ordered...
● Crunchy fried fish and chips»»» Not at all good...
♡ Badami murgh tikka»»» Excellent... very very tasty...
♡ Kadai chicken»»» Awesome one... perfect mix of spices... Good for spicy food lovers...
★ Rogani naan with cheese»»» okish one... may be little more cheese will work...
★ Garlic naan»»» Good one...
They also serves complimentary paan too...
I found the service time was bit long... they need to work on it...
Pocket pinch was quite acceptable...

New place in our neighbourhood. With the amount of advertisement they have done, it was necessary to try out this place. Well not disappointed at all. 
The interiors are just ok, has a very family kind of environment. 
Almost all items we tried were great except everything in fish. Original vetki but had no taste.

We went there for buffet lunch at about 1.30 PM on 24th June and were very disappointed with the quality of service.. We were a group of 8 people and had to wait about half an hour or more for a table.. and then when we got a table, all the food in the buffet spread was FINISHED !!!.. 
It was an endless wait for refills.. hungry and impatient we began filling our plates and stomach with whatever scrapings we could find.. The food finally arrived at about 2.50 PM.. Food quality was good, so was the decor, but we were really disappointed with their unprofessional attitude.. would not recommend this restaurant to anyone especially if you're going in for the buffet lunch.. My rating would be -2.5/5.0..

We had ordered Chicken Singapore Rice Noodles, Drums of Heaven & Chilli Garlic Shower Fried Fish with Hunan Sauce via Zomato (Home Delivery). Although delivery took a bit more time than what was indicated on website, nonetheless, the food was hot. The Noodles & Drums of Heaven were good; however, we were thoroughly disappointed with the fish. The dish (Chilli Garlic Shower Fried Fish with Hunan Sauce) smelled weird and the fish tasted as though it had been in cold storage for a very long time. We had earlier ordered food from this very restaurant, but, at that time the food was good; so, we were quite surprised at the (low) quality of the fish.

Since 2016 is a very beautifully decorated restaurant. From the entrance passage to every thing there was finesse in the interior. Totally in love with it.
Location- it is beside city centre,in the same building of vasan eye care,3rd floor.
When we reached there they gave us slight wet scented towel for refreshment. It was really good of them to provide such things. They are so friendly and courteous.
We opted for buffet. They served us a complimentary drink- cool blue. It was really tasty and refreshing. Coming to the buffet, they have 4starters which consist of two veg starters and two non-veg starters and one chicken sweet corn soup. In main course there are veg and non-veg fried rice and chowmein as well as two veg and non-veg side dishes. In dessert there is vanilla ice cream,darsaan and brownie.
We went for non-veg items.
Chicken in pepper &salt(if i m not wrong about the name)- it was good. Loved the combination of chicken with various types of bell peppers.
Fish shezwan[dry]- it was yummy. Fish was soft and it tasted great.
Chicken sweet corn soup- i m in love with it. The balance of the sweetness,corn bits and chicken was perfect. Yummy.
Chicken fried rice- it was okhay. Simple decent fried rice
Chicken chowmein- it was also okhay.
Fish in coriander gravy/sauce- i personally liked it. Since i love the taste and flavour of coriander i liked this item. The softness of the fish with the earthy flavour of the corainder was great.
Chili chicken- it was good.
Vanilla ice cream- the ice cream was smooth,really smooth and combining it with brownie and darsaan was awesome.
Darsaan- they were small yet crispy and loaded with sweetness. But they weren't too sweet which i liked the most.
Brownie- they were in small cubes with bits of walnuts. I felt it should have been a bit softer but when i wad having it with ice cream it was seriously good.
Lastly the served us with meetha/meethi pan.
Coming to the price it's 333rs including all taxes.

Situated at a very convenient location, right next to city center one in salt lake, opposite Bata, this place is a nice try for fine diners. The last time I visited this place, I was with my family. Although the buffet here is quite pocket friendly but I usually like to order my own choices from the menu, so we went with the A La Carte option. We were amazed by the quality and taste of food. Before anything else, let me mention the dishes which you must try when you are here. In Indian you must try gondhoraaj tandoor macch, kasa mangsho (mutton) and kaju kishmis pulao. Taste and quality wise I liked these dishes more than what they make in O Calcutta! (O Calcutta has been my favorite for bengali cuisine until I tried Since 2016) Every time I go there I make sure I order these. If you like continental do try baked lamb ossobucco served on a bed of saffron risotto. I assure you would come back this.
I like how they welcome you first with an on-the-house drink and wet towels. And they end it with a special pan in a cute looking box. The look and feel of their service is really nice. I usually prefer this place for official meetings and family outings. The ambiance is great. Staffs are courteous and serve food on time.  
This is a must try. Although a relatively new place, it has the potential of being one of  the most renowned restaurants in the city.
Good going team Since 2016!

An awesome restaurant, pocket friendly and good quality! I had been there with my friends for my birthday treat and enjoyed the stay throughout. We spent around 3 hours chatting and gorging on the delicious items. We took the buffet which was for 333 inclusive everything and it comprised of a salad, 2 veg and 2 non veg starters, then hakka noodles, fried rice, coriander fish and chilli chicken for the main course and to top it all, last but not the least the desserts comprising of darsaan and brownie with ice cream. Everything thing was just too nice and that too for a price of 333! Another thing that catches attention and grabs extra points is their courteous behaviour and an extremely warm way of welcoming the guests in with a wet towel a complimentary drink! The decor starting from the entrance with beautifully crafted lights, the colour combinations, the tables and the walls with snaps from all over the world really gives you positive vibes all throughout. We had a lovely time sitting for hours chatting and eating to our heart's delight. Oh yes, at then end you also get a paan which too tastes very good although it's a bit weird after a full course Chinese meal but for paan lovers like me, that also adds another feather to the hat! Overall I wish Since 2016 all the best, and would suggest everyone to go and visit this place whenever you are around!
One suggestion, that is, the food for buffet should be refilled a bit faster and should be warm, we had to wait for a number of times because of the delay of the refilling and the foods being cold. But apart from this, it is seriously worth for at least a one time visit and with the buffet option!

We take Chicken corn soup was which was delicious..

Paneer item was tasty but I didn"t like the fish item.. They took a lot of time to serve chicken starter.. and chicken was hard..
In main course they had fried rice and noodles (both veg and non veg).. Veg fried rice was good in taste.. But  the side dishes were not that good(chicken and fish).. They again took a lot of time to refill side dishes..
Desert contained 2 options.. Darsan, brownie and ice cream.. There was only 1 choice in ice cream but delicious..
So its basically very average buffet.. As price is very low ..Its better not to expect anything special.. 1 visit is enough..
Cost of 2 was 666..

Chicken Soup was awesome, Starters were good, though I liked the veg starters that non veg. But main course was a big disappointment. Fired rice and noodles both were over cooked. Dessert was the best part for me. Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream and darsan. Lastly Mitha Paan was the best part of the buffet. 

Staff Behaviour was good - 4/5

Food - 2/5

Ambience - 4/5

Price - 3/5 (it was very cheap but should maintain food quality)

I'm yet to visit this restaurant personally, but have received rave reviews from my mother who had lunch over here. I'd ordered for a home delivery on 25th and the food arrived just as promised, on time, not a minute late! Tastewise good, sufficient but not extravagant from a quantity perspective. We had ordered mixed fried rice and shower fried chilli garlic fish and was satisfied with both. Significant gestures like adding a pan for the end of the meal is appreciated. Keep up the good work in both delivery and eating in!!

30Apr17 I'm editing my review after visiting and experience their buffet. The restaurant has limited space but keeps on taking unlimited reservations leading to very congested seating, specially for 2. The staff insist that if you are 2 , you occupy a 2 seater only. Buffet items are not ready when buffet starts, in our case fish and chips and ice-cream/darsaan were missing. Darsan was served only after we have finished with the handwash.
The service and hospitality of the people around are great and full marks to them for that. Point is when you charge ₹480 for a buffet people expect a certain amount of balance in taste and supply chain management which was grossly missing. Guys some suggestions for you to be top notch
1) Reduce the number of starters. Soup was good, 1 fish, 1 chicken and maybe 2 veg should be a maximum. Current number of starters is excessive with taste very similar. Lollypop and pepper garlic tasted almost the same.
2) Ditto for the main course. Why are t he rice and noodles only non-veg if the choice of gravies include pure veg. Reduce gravies to 2-3, and price veg and non-veg buffets differentially.
3) Once excessive variety is reigned in, automatically supply chain should improve and the dessert hopefully come before handwash.
I've tested the a la carte and home delivery and it's excellent. Dine in guests go mainly for the buffet, so please pull up your socks on that , so you are overall world class.

Food-real tasty food,chefs special chicken patiyala won my heart😍,chicken tangri kabab was extremely soft!,Peas polao and tandori roti were also good☺.
Posh decor,servicemen were extremely well behaved and courteous.
Taxes- as per goverment rules

Location: 3rd floor,Vasan eye care,opposite of Bata showroom,city centre, Salt lake 
Warm welcome by the staffs of this restaurant. Once entered floor manager showed us the tables and pulled the chairs for us..
Staff came with 2 chilled rolled towel with a lovely fragrance in order to cool ourselves to beat the heat..
Ambiance was like 3 star hotel with lovely chairs,couches and tables..😉
Staff served with complimentary drink that was Lassi.. 
As it is a Chinese buffet there is lots of variety so we ate:
STARTERS -
*Chicken sweet & sour soup : sweet good taste
*kimchi salad:  fried noodles mixed with onions,tomato,carrots & sauces. It was yummy
*crispy fried baby corn: was good but not too crispy
*chilli dry paneer: tofu or paneer it was well tossed with Capsicum,onion & chills but the paneer was very hard 
*crispy fried chicken: it was good but the big pieces were chewy but well coated
*schezwan fried fish: it was ok-ish.
MAIN COURSE -
*Chicken noodles: fine 
*egg & chicken fried rice: good 
*fish in coriander sauce: no I didn't find it interesting
*chilli chicken: yes good one 
DESSERT-
*chocolate nutty Brownie: tasted fine
* Darshaan:  it was damn good.
*vanilla ice cream 
***Iced Pan: mitha wala..
          We ordered fresh lime soda and Pepsi. Trust me I'm in love with lime soda its really refreshing..
Overall the food was fine because whatever the restaurant is serving with rs 333/- including taxes is amazing! 
Kudos to the staffs for this buffet..
Recommended😘😘

Availed delivery service from this restaurant.The order taker seemed pretty  courteous & knowledgeable.I was looking for fish tikka & he suggested the gandhoraaj tandoor maach which proved to be a significantly tasty preparation.Kolkata bekti fish with a cheesy coating & flavored with our very own gandhoraaj lebu made it a juicy affair.5 pcs were served in a portion whereas the order taker informed about 4 pcs.Alongside chicken bharta & butter naan were also ordered but i found them average taste wise.Portioning was sufficient but i felt it was little over priced compared to the taste of the product.Packaging was quite compact hence the food was able to retain its temperature as much as possible.Amazingly the delivery was made before the quoted time which was very impressive.Looking forward to drop in person someday.Bon apetit.

Got my food home delivered by Zomato from SINCE 2016 last Saturday. We kept the order simple keeping in mind that it was my first order from the place.

The order contained -
Chicken American Chopsuey
Mixed Fried Rice
Chicken in Butter Garlic Sauce

The order got delivered before the stipulated time. All 3 items were packed separately in plastic bowls and foils, along with napkins and to my surprise, a PAAN!! I mean, who eats paan after a Chinese meal??!! The answer is, me..! So naturally I got delighted!

Coming to the food.

Chicken American Chopsuey
 - Fried Noodles and gravy were packed separately as expected. Portions were good enough. Noodles were crispy but a bit over-fried and hard as a result. The gravy was tasty on its own, balanced between sweet and sour.. with a poach on top of it.. but tasted quite flat when mixed with the fried noodles. It lacked seasoning as well. Overall, not recommended.

Mixed Fried Rice - The rice looked clean, with not-so-generous amount of egg, prawn and chicken. My first two bites tasted good, but the third went disastrous as it contained a piece of stinking prawn. Eventually we found that all the prawns were spoilt. We had to remove all the prawns and have the rest of the rice, which was okay. 

Chicken in Butter Garlic Sauce - Chicken pieces in a white gravy containing ONLY Butter and Garlic. I am actually fond of garlic, but they kind of overdid it. Half a teaspoon a garlic pieces with every single chicken is quite too much. That overpowered the smell of butter as well. Addition of a few split green chilies and less usage of garlic would have made the dish taste better I felt. And, again, it lacked seasoning. 

All these 3 items costed us 799/-.

I was eager to have a meal at this place but this order have set the expectations for me. Need to visit the restaurant and see if the ambiance works any better for me.

Was on my list for quite some time! Decided to try out their takeaway dinner option on aSaturday night!
The decor looked impressive! The owner was a friendly person who looked pretty proud about his restaurant!
The staff was excellently behaved and wore a smile always! Even for takeaways I have never been treated to luxuriously! They insisted we take a seat inside the restaurant. They offered water. Even offered a drink and insisted with a smile.
The place was quite empty on a Saturday evening. They still need to market the place more! The place has a lot of potential in terms of food. The 4 is because since its new would cut them slack till I try them out again! Hopefully soon! 😀

Went on a busy Saturday to this newly opened place in city centre 1 as most of the other choices were covered many times. Twas a friend's bday and wat btr way to celebrate other than a good dinner. The restaurant is a new one and they left no stone unturned in being a gracious host. They took the cake we bought for our friend and made the arrangements for her celebrations.. Now to the food :
They offer you a opening drink which is okay. 
We ordered :
1. Chicken tandoori 
2. Chicken Malai kebab(it was awesome) 
3. Kung pao chicken
4.Chilli Chicken
5. Mixed hakka noodles.
The quality and quantity was enough to fill all of us to the fullest. In the end they even offered a token dessert (very nice ice cream) as it was my friend's bday. Overall a good experience and one should visit it at least once. They also offer a buffet spread @333 only on weekdays.. Need to try once.

Went to this newly opened restaurant last week and the experience was very pleasant. Although the location is a bit inconvenient to find out but the ambience inside is great. They welcomed us with a refresher drink and it was awesome. We took butter naan and patiala chicken. Both were delicious and we ended up eating more naans than we estimated. The staffs are very courteous. I will definitely like to visit there again.

Located in City Centre 1, Salt Lake. 

This place is very appealing as soon as you enter. You will be welcomed with a Wet Towel, which is so refreshing for this summer. And followed by a Welcome Drink, which is again so good.

The ambience is nice with good music's being played. Decor is soothing. Seating arrangements are nice.

Tried their Lunch Buffet. It had 1 Soup, 2 Starters (both Chicken items), Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice, 1 Fish items & 1 Chicken item as Side dish, Brownies, Wantons & Ice Cream (Vanilla).

*Soup was great. 
*Two starters were just okay ! Lacked in taste. Didn't have the juicy taste of chicken.
*Noodles & Rice was good.
*Fish & Chicken were just fine. Could have been made better.
*Brownies were awesome. Wantons were okay.
*Ice cream could have been of more flavours. Not everyone likes Vanilla. Right ! However at such low price, Buffet is impressive.
Oh yes ! Fresh Lime Soda, separately ordered, was nicely done.

Service is quick & efficient. Staffs are courteous & hospitality is commendable. 

Overall, a nice place to visit with your people. Since it's a new outlet, the service is appreciable. :)

Located opposite Bata store near city centre 1

A good and sleek decor with a funky feel to it, a nice soothing aroma with televisions for the viewers

You're welcomed with a drink and a wet towel ans the USP here is its all inclusive buffet at 333

Two starters two side dishes fried rice nd noodles plus soup and dessert at that price is surely cheap

This is an add on review:
The management is hereby requested to tell each of its staff to know that customers come first and that they should not be exploited.
I went there after a year and the manager said please have as per my wish, I will ensure the best, upon his insistence, we had a starter which was utter rubbish and were charged huge amounts, we wanted to have buffet which comparatively low cost and a much better spread, but this manager has clearly fooled us to get more money, totally disappointed and disgusted with such behaviour from a place which ws  in my good books.

The food is not great bt not bad, it just scores enuf to keep ur taste buds engaged and interested

The fried stuff could have tasted fresher.

Courteous and prompt staff and efficient service

My colleagues ordered two preparations of lamb but those were not that good but everyone praised the dishes of mutton and fish.

This restaurant in one word is just brilliant. Went there for a small office party and we enjoyed thoroughly. Situated in the third floor of Vasan eye care building. Ambiance is really classy, waiters are very polite and helpful and the most important thing is that the food items are absolutely mouth watering, just too good. We ordered many items- chicken kalmi kabab, fish peshawari tikka, achari paneer tikka, masala kulcha, garlic naan, roghani naan, malai kofta, chicken patiyala, bhuna mutton, fresh lime soda, chocolate brownie, all the items were top notch, too good. We never expected all the items to be equally wonderful, we explore many restaurants in kolkata but this has to be one of the best north indian restaurant in the city right now, a heaven for fine diners. The price is not steep so it wont pinch the pocket. They started lunch buffet , dont know how it is but north indian ala carte is simply outstanding. Hoping to visit it again in near future and expecting to get same kind of wonderful hospitality and food.

Their hospitality and the staff were polite and very nice. The starters were delicious but the main course food were not up to the mark. Well it was a wonderful experience for me. Perhaps a A la Carte would be a better option.

was in Kolkata for a week and was near the vip road area when i saw the hoardings of this place. i must say teh marketing team has done a great job by ensuring people traveling from VIP road towards salt lake are bound to notice about the place. So, we also decided to try out there. It was late around 3.30 pm but hey still said the buffet was available! liked that attitude! :)
As soon as we went, they offered us a wet hand towel which was a nice gesture! I liked the complimentary Aam panna so much that ordered one more in Ala carte. Now coming to the food! Well at 333 whatever they have provided is really good! I just felt the food could have been a little less oily especially the fish! I wrote the same in the feedback form. Starters were good and main course could have been a little better!
But overall:
Ambience: warm & nice
Food: good could have been better
Staff: helpful and friendly
i will surely visit again and try out dishes in ala carte! :)

Went for the lunch buffet , with friends . You get a complimentary wet towel and a juice immediately you enter the restaurant. It is beautifully decorated, the staff certainly impresses you .
Now coming to the food, it's a lunh buffet, it had pretty much the same things you get at haka..but at a reasonably cheaper price. Its delicious. The ved and nin veg starters were excellent. The main course fried rice and chowmein were well seasoned.
I was a bit dissapointed with the schezwan chicken and spicy chicken, as both seemed bland in taste. To end on a perfect goodnote, they had good ice cream and brownie. Hot chocolate could have made it better though.
Overall at 333 rupees, its the best chinese buffet i have had. Plannign to go again for dinner with family.
Will recomment this to everyone.

Visited this restaurant just last night for a family dinner. It has a very warm n welcoming ambience. The service of the staff is worth mentioning. They do know their job well.
On entering, you'll be greeted with a wet towel (to cool you down in this scorching summer) and a welcome drink (aam panna). 
Coming to the food, we had ordered Chicken Manchow Soup and crispy chilly babycorn which were perfect. 
In the main course, we went on to order different cuisines. The chicken Hakka noodles n chilli chicken were good. Plain naan n Subz Jhalfrezi in the Indian main course, though were good but too oily. And lastly we also tried their Spaghetti in arabiatta sauce which was not at all up to the mark. 
Overall, you can try their Chinese n Indian. But given one bad experience in the continental cuisine, I personally wouldn't recommend trying it.
They also serve you complimentary paans after dining.

PS: They have a lunch buffet too and I certainly look forward to trying it out.

The ambience is good, they treat their customers very well and the food is worth having. The only problem being that service is too too slow. Had to wait for almost an hour for the main course. And they took another 20 mins to serve desserts which was just plain ice cream. Visit the place if you have a lot of time in hand.

Complimentary aam-pora sharbat was a nice entre.
Coming to the food .. We had dum chicken biriyani along with chicken patiyala.. And I must say the gravy was just too good 
.. Biriyani was flavoursome as well.. 
But the dessert was disappointing.. Just one scoop of ice cream in darsaan!! .. Really.. Come on..
Rest all in all.. Everything was good .. The waiters were very courteous and helpful

Global cuisine is what caught my eye before i decided to try this particular restaurant. Was having this Thai cuisine craving for quite some time, and coming to think of it, there aren't many good restaurants in Salt Lake that serve authentic Thai food. 

Located near City Centre, there are a lot of other places to choose from. Anyhow, decided to try this newly opened restro as the reviews were decent and they had Thai on their menu. ;)

Well, you are in for a pleasant surprise as soon as you enter. They give you cold wet towels to freshen up. And then comes the welcome drink. It was Aam Pora Sharbat for us. Quite good indeed! And no, it doesn't stop there. Then they bring you finger bowl with rose petals and lemon. Extra points to you 'Since 2016' for the service!

Coming to the menu, as they boast of "Global cuisine", you will find that they serve Indian, Chinese, Continental, Italian etc. For starters, we ordered American Corn & Cheese Balls. Crispy and yummy! However, for someone like me who absolutely loves cheese and wants cheese to just ooze out of cheese balls, you'd want that little bit extra. Coming to the Main course, even before I had entered I knew what i wanted to have, so I ordered Thai Red Curry & Steamed Rice. The gravy lacked consistency and was a bit on the bitter side. However, it tasted nice. Although a bit different from the regular Thai curry. 

Food was decent. Prices a tad too bit on the higher side. The decor is great and it was quite spacious. What takes the cake is the impeccable service. 10 on 10 for that.

Pros:

* You'd be happy with the service
* Ambiance - Chic and spacious

Cons:

* Can improve the quality of the food

Went 2 days back to celebrate my friend's Birthday. Amazing ambiance and delightful decoration. When we entered we were welcomed by the staff and guided to a table. As soon as we sat down we were given wet towels to freshen up and then a bowl of water with rose petals to wash our hands. Then we were given complimentary drinks which was really good and refreshing.
We ordered 2 starters, American Corn and Cheese Ball (WOG)  which was delicious and  Jalapeno Cheese Champion which lacked the spice expected from Jalapeno, but was still good.
Post that we ordered Methi Matar Malai (WOG), Butter Naan and Stuffed Kulcha for the Vegies, all of which were super delicious.
And Mutton Dagbungalow and Stuffed Kulcha for the Non Veggies, which according to them was amazing too.
For 4 people (2 Veg, 2 Non-veg) the quantity of the serving was good and more than enough.
We also ordered Virgin Pinacolada and another Cocoa flavored drink (Not in the menu but based on server's recommendation) and they just made our day.
When we finished, they gave us warm water bowls to clean our hands and a Mishti Paan Box, 
which was the worst sweet paan me and my friends had ever tasted. I pointed this to the management, and they said that they would look into it as they were not sure why this was not good.
Overall, barring the last ingredient(which is the reason for not giving them 4.5), it was an amazing and lovely experience.

## WOG - Without Onion and Garlic

I was not aware of since 2016 and went there along with my friend. Well initially we do reviewed about Since 2016( tried to be sceptical). We took a chance hoping not to waste an afternoon, but it came out to be a good experience altogether. Food was good but not great as the kabab seemed to be somewhat undercooked. The ambience was great to spend a good time with someone special as well as hanging out with bunch of friends. The food and is not that much costly compared to other restaurants. Overall it's a good place to spend some quality time.

This place was a let down for me. The interior is sober and the service is good..but where it falls short is its food. I ordered grilles chicken with tomato and honey glaze,the chicken was rubbery and the taste was average. This experience taught me never to simply trust the advertisements.

We had a great experience here. From the moment we entered into Since 2016, the experience was simply wow. Be it it's ambience, service or food. Frankly speaking after a long time I visited a place that provides optimum comfort zone for you and your loved ones when you decide to spent time over a table full of delicious dishes. Good work team since 2016. Keep up the good work
