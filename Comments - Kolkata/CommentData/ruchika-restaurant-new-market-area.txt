I did not like their ambience. The food was not up to the mark..it was so so quality. Moreover the services were of low quality where we were kep unattended for more than 15 mins. Then we had to call for giving the menu card. And after ordering the food wasn't served until 30mins. So the services are really cheap.
I won't prefer to visit ever again even if I'm starving

Made the biggest mistake of the day when we decided to enter this place.. The moment i stepped in with my mom n bro i knew im going to regret this as i saw most of the tables empty on a busy evning with new market thronging with shoppers and other eateries filled to the brim.. But then i wondered how bad could it get.. We saw the menu and couldnt blive a simple egg hakka noodle n egg fried rice would cost 130rs fr a non a.c place.. And sweet n sour chicken was rs 150.. A tawa roti cost rs 10 each while most places in new market sell tandoori rotis fr less than that.. Anyway we ordered these 3 items and a pav bhaaji... The food arrived quite late considering the fact that the place was just abt 20% full..  Both the noodles and rice were less than ordinary but the worst was the sweet n sour chicken.. It was chicken tossed in a few tomatoes and tomato ketchup..how lame is that?.. . The paav bhaji is best not spoken about.. The staff however were polite..

Used to be my collge days fav, but the quality has been degreded over the years. I used to like their momo, veg noodle gravy, ice cream sundac. But now a days, its really intolerable to sit there as they don't have air conditioning. Also the food its not been upto the mark. Pocket pinch moderate, staffs are not well mannered.

Located just beside Sreeram Arket. There was nothing special about the decoration. Next food was average in taste. We ordered Hydrabadi biriyani and chicken curry and both the preparations were not that much tempting.

Well will visit this restaurant mandatorily if we went for shopping to the Shreeram Arcade in the New Market Area, Kolkata.
This place heavenly serves our one of the favourite dishes the #MixedFriedRice and #ChilliChicken it's taste as well as quantity of the food is just great and go hand-in-hand!
But, had to mention that this place has no ACs over here and it's being totally a bit crowded since masses of people came here after there shopping paradise.
But no problem as it all totally worth it and mainly it's food itself sort all other problems of it. Nice place to come with family for satisfying hunger after a long tiresome journey known as 'Shopping' here.

Okay so one fine day when I was not in a mood to try Street food in new market area any further, I found myself at Ruchika. To my surprise the ambience was decent in comparison to the other eateries in the locality. There was no AC but the fans were working well. One won't find professional waiters but they know their job well. 
When my order Paneer Fried rice came, I realised it was too much in quantity for me to eat alone so I asked the waiter to parcel the half. My plate was loaded with lots of soft and juicy paneer cubes sprinkled on the rice which was not greasy and perfect for an afternoon meal. üòä

This is a life saver after you have shopped at new matket. Food might not be very delicious but they are nice . Prices are up to the mark for what they provide. Its not a/c restaurant which doesnt matter in winters but its not at all a good experience as all the heat from their kitchen will reach you. One of the things which I didnt like is when one of the waiters was just nagging to me about what tips some lady gave him that is Rs. 7 ,I think they should accept whats given to them gracefully. Sitting arangement is okayish.Apart from these my fav dish here is American chopsuey, I find it healthy and a plate is more than enough for a person. When you dont feel like going to KFC, dominos etc or you dont have enough money left have something here.

Two hungry souls-check!
Time:2:45pm!
Card accepted here? Check!
In these days of demonetisation, even the worst restaurants accepting cards will do business and the best not doing so, will suffer..
Ruchika was on our go-to list since we have started having icecream from the bhaiya who has a shop outside ruchika, which is like forever!

Ambience: In summer this place must be very sultry, it's an open restaurant, as in no ACs but since it's winter, we didn't feel the temperature causing any problem but the tables are quite closely placed and given the restaurant's popularity, the place is almost packed during lunch hours.

Service: Service was fast, food arrived hot and fresh in no time!

Food: After my experience at Mirch Masala, I was apprehensive of the fact that a plate of fried rice might not satisfy the hunger of two people but then it did!
We ordered mixed fried rice(with lots of prawns,to my dismay :( ) and chicken sweet and sour. The rice was tasty, with lots of prawn, chicken and fried egg. The chicken was okayish, the pieces were big, and boneless :)
Price: Prices are a bit on the higher side, given the restaurant's ambience, but then it's in esplanade and finding a place to sit and eat after a tiring shopping day in esplanade is worth of spending a bit more! Although they accept cards, you need to go and swipe your card in a garments shop in Shreeram Arcade.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all hungry people who are tired (after shopping in esplanade) :D

It was an snacks outlet situated in new market area. Huge space. Proper sitting arrangement. Ambience and hospitality was above average. Service was bit slow. Presentation was good. Friendly and helpful staff. Price was reasonable. I tried their Dessert which was triple scoop ice cream. Two scoop of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate with poured dark chocolate, nuts, cashew and Cherie on top. It was Delicious in taste and price was also reasonable. Totally loved it. A must try.

Though it is near friends home restaurant, it lacks behind in quality perhaps because of its multicuisine attempt. Attention to one particular region or culinary type would have perhaps worked for it as it has a good location and is bigger than adjoining restaurants spacewise.

After spending a heavy morning at an Educational Fair at the Grand Hotel, I was terribly hungry. I had a friend with me. We decided that New Market houses several places to eat. So we walked to New Market. And then after moving from one to another, all of a sudden it started raininga little heavily. We found that we cannot eat in the roadside stalls and somehow managed to come here. 

The place was fairly crowded. We were lucky that we could grab a two chairs. We were provided with a menu card and my eyes grew big after seeing price of the items. We saw a couple having simply fried rice, no side included. Prices are insanely huge. 

There were almost 5-6 waiters but none approached willingly until I prompted. And after that we were served a glass of chilled drinking water. 

Our order were served five minutes after that. And then we had the most terrific experience. Priced at ‚Çπ 180, we expected an amount that can easily be shared among two! But to my utter disappointment, we served an amount that would not even fill a perdon's belly completely. So imagine a situation where you are still hungry after having a plate but can't afford for anything because of the price is too high.

After having a spoon or two I was literally wandering why did I step into it. The noodles tasted so flat and there were hardly any vegetables in it. Chicken pieces were very few and were so hard to tear. Having a hungry stomach and getting such bad food, it really is disappointing. 

The thing doesn't end here. The waiter claimed to pay him tips. I was in no mood to talk to him further. The bill was of ‚Çπ 180 and I received ‚Çπ 20 back. I gave him that because I felt that anything I buy with that 20 rupees will make me fall sick. 

I don't know but may be it was a bad day for me. Share your experiences!

One of many small restaurants in the busy New Market Area, Ruchika serves good food at decent prices. I visited the place with a group of friends for lunch. We ordered Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian with Chicken Hakka Noodles and Mixed Gravy Noodles to go with it. It tasted fine.

This place serves an amazing array of ice cream sundaes and we tried out their Pista Fiesta and Caramel Desire. Both tasted great but I particularly loved the latter.

Service is fast and the prices are very decent. You are definitely try this place out if you are in the area.

This place is located in esplanade near the oberoi hotel..We went there at 3pm. Still the place was crowded which shows its a popular restaurant..We had chicken Biryani. The biryani was prepared in a different way as comapared to Hyderabadi biryani as it had rose water sprinkled on it.¬†Still it was tasty. The price was bit on the higher side considering the quantity it was serving(still enough for one person to it) and also ¬†the chicken pieces were boneless.It was a good experiennce and service was quick.You can certainly give it a try.

This restaurant is located beside Sreeram Arcade. It has a decent amount of seating space and is always crowded. The ambience is okayish and nothing much to say about.
Coming to the food, itself not bad! It is decent and nice. There's nothing fabulous but then it doesn't disappoint either. Moreover the prices are quite low and that doesn't hurt the cause either. So, in simple terms, it's an average restaurant which serves average food which will define not wow you but at the same time, definitely won't disappoint you either. I would recommend this only if you are through with all other restaurants nearby and are in search of a cheap eating option.
Happy Dining!

Located in New Market (beside Sreeram Arcade). Like the area, this place is also crowded.
The ambience is poor. Seating arrangement is okay. It's very congested and remains crowded, mostly.
The decor needs to be rectified.
The staffs are lazy but service is still satisfactory enough.
Had ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and Cold Drink. 
The food was good, both in terms of quality and quantity. But still I think it's overpriced for the food and service, they provide. Give it a thought ! 

Hope to visit next time. :)

Located in the busy new market area, Ruchika is a supposed to be a no nonsense quick serve restaurant. We ordered for a veg and egg chow mein, aloo paratha and mutter paneer gravy. The taste was decent and stayed true to the street food/dhaba style food. The waiting time however was immense due to the festival crowds. Will love to visit them when its less busy.

Ruchika has a special place in my heart. Lots of memories. This was the first restaurant in my life where I had food with my friends in my college days. It was the first restaurant where I gave treat to my parents with my own money. Time and again I have gone there - with or without company.
We have taken momo- both steamed and fried - and both tasted good. We have taken chow mein, chilly chicken, chicken soup, and there was no complaint. The price is also reasonable. The waiters are overworked, but they are more or less prompt. The place is huge, the seating arrangement ample, so no problem. It is natural that I would go there again, with/without company.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: With so many restaurants and food stalls surrounding the new market area this place has been on of them which has some popularity at this place. In the new market area just beside Friend's Home resto a good place to have a breakfast lunch or dinner. With the food varieties and quality they provide this place never goes empty any time.¬†

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: ¬†Looks like a roadside resto but it is enough big to have almost 50-70 people dine in at a time. Lots of tables to offfer you. Colored walls with simple lightings. This place is a Non ac so not a good idea to be here if you are looking for chilled AC. Place is somehow clean. Staffs are attentive and polite. Runs to you quickly when you dine in.¬†

FOOD: Heard a lot about the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani of this place so when i sat to eat i had to order that only. It took 10-15 mins for my order to arrive at my table. When it came it looked very ordinary from above. But when i put my spoon on it, it was something different from the regular biriyani. the taste was different where i can feel the spices and chilly a bit. Rice was tasty and mixed well. Seemed heavy to me while eating as it was not a regular biriyani Small pieces of chicken were added i.e 5-6 with no potato. Generally i had a different type of stuff this time. I also had the Chicken Chowmien from here which was very good too. Filled with chicken and good in taste.

Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani: 8/10

Chicken Chowmien : 8/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food was good overall and quantity of the biriyani was enough for a person. Price was a bit high of the dish but as it was not a regular one so i think it was obvious.

CONCLUSION: Not a bad place. You can have Veg or Non veg without any thoughts. Both dishes will make you satisfied. Don't expect too much to be get surprised by the food as the other legendary joints. BE simple. cheers

NOTE: ¬†The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Horrible food. Waited for over 45 minutes to receive our order. Service was terrible. We went to an empty restaurant and waited long enough to see many customers order and leave as they were not even served. I stayed till the end to see the final product hoping the food quality would make up for the delay. But no.

Ordered steamed chicken momo and mixed chowmein. The food was quite good. So was the seating arrangement and decor. The waiters were well behaved. The only glitch was we had to wait for a long time for the food. Will definitely go back. I am kind of alternating between scoop and this one now!

Horrible restaurant. The chilli chicken was sweet ( with tomato sauce), boneless chicken masala was actually gravy of chicken pakoda, aloo paratha was soggy. Avoid this place as there are many restaurants in new market area. For this kind of food and service the price is too high. My bill was Rs. 560 and i gave him Rs 600, he did not give back the change. Don't go to this place at all.

It is situated in newmarket area.
i tried gravy noodles.
the quantity was good. Taste was ok for me.
but the ambience is not so good.
and the price is too much for that ambience.

Good Food at Cheap Price, Centrally Located beside Shopping heaven New Market . But the service of the waiters are not a par with other restaurants in the area. Its extremely popular among common bengali shopper families, its always crowded especially in the weekends
