Don't buy anything from this shop because they don't give all the products in parcel. They did not check when give parcel.... Please check all the products when you take parcel.......

After GST, prices are highly raised.Foods are no doubt great in taste and hospitality is very refreshing.Efficient staff, food arrives within short time and lots of  times we've visited the restaurant we've never been disappointed.

I went to this here with mah friend.. it's located near the 12no rail gate, Barasat.. we ordered chicken tengri kabab, mixed Friedrice, Chicken Manchurian.. Mixed Friedrice was better taste then expected and obviously sufficient for two people... Chicken Manchurian was jst a bliss... Stuffs are quite good and service was little much delay..

Once a very known spot, food was really tasty 5-6 years back compared to today's one. Chinese is a must try here. Price are within budget though the ambience is a shabby one.

One of the oldest restaurants in barasat. The location has been a curse from start itself. foods were good some 3-4 years back, hasn't changed much. was a single good outlet for people to eat chinese and indian dishes at a good price. price has remained almodst same unlike "blossom" which has hiked it's prices a lot,once blossom restaurant was trying to catch lord's but now it has surpassed, mainly not because of food quality but location. They need to re-invent the menu's and add certain aesthetic element's to the decoration and improve the seats. a very honest word from a customer who ate at their opening.

One of the worst resturant i have ever visited. As there are less options available in barasat so had no choice
Some very bad observations
Behaviour of waiters are really bad.
Disorganised service waited for almost 1 hour after ordering.
I would rather choose to starve than to visit LORDS once again.

We don't have much option for eating out at Barasat. This is one of the reliable options to choose from. 
Pocket friendly restaurant.
Food quality varies time to time. 
Quantity served is always enough.
I like their Thai soup and chicken reshmi butter masala a lot.

This place surprised me many times with their good or bad foods... I have been there many times... I am not writing about bad experience. But the good things are about the quantity and variation in menu... I usually have Chinese there. Last time the Suchan chicken (not shezwan) was perfectly adjusted beside the chicken mutton fried rice. But my girlfriend complained me why the quantity of chkn and mutton is much than the rice? Ha haha.... really awesome it was. You guys can have it. I hope this place will keep oi n their good services.

One of oldest living restaurants of Barasat and the 2nd AC restaurant of Barasat. Since the early 2000's, Lords has kept its quality intact. The ambiance is kind of lousy, but the food is always good. Other than the biriyani, almost every Indian, Chinese, tandoor and snacks are awesome. Excellent value for money.

I would say they were good like past 3 years ago... Now they serve very low quality foods...
It was my previous review...
Few days ago I tried some chinese items which were good and Biriyani was also decent... I think they are improvising with their food quality (not sure about all items) which is appreciable... 👍
