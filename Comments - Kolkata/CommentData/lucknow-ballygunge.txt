Visited this place last Sunday for dinner...the main reason we chose this place was to avoid crowd and waiting. The location is quite offbit and maybe that is the main reason the restaurant was empty on a Sunday night when we visited, that too being on a Durga puja Chaturthi in the city (when the popular restaurants all over the city are overcrowded with people) and we ended up being the only ones in the restaurant all the time!
Anyway our overall experience has been a mixed one. Ambience is comfortable and interiors are well decorated mughal style. We ordered masala cola n lemonades for refreshments n mutton galawti kebab for appetizers. The galawti was tasty n well cooked. For main course we ordered handi biriyani which is d speciality here, chicken rara, mutton keema n paratha, mutton chap. Other than biriyani, nothing was upto the mark. The biriyani came covered in earthen handis n had a rich aroma of ghee, but it was delicious n well cooked with traditional aloo n two pieces of mutton/chicken. The sides were disappointing though. Even desserts - shahi tukda n phirni - was bad n awkward. Cost is not much compared to food quantity but they should improve quality n taste of food. The staff members were really nice n courteous all the time. Overall i rate 3/5.

Really amazing Biryani of top notch quality. The quantity provided is also quite sufficient. The chicken piece in the Biryani was very well cooked and tender. The prawn biryani is also quite good cooked with a myriad of spices. The food despite being cooked in ghee is unexpectedly comparatively quite light.

Decent place with some moderate flaws. First the location is hard to get. Take the ballygunge circular road alley from ballygunge phari walk for 7-8mins turn to small alley on the right the restaurant is at the dead end of it. Ambience not that great though the arrangements are proper. Food is ordinary but affordable. We had chicken banzara kebab, parda biriyani and Malai kofta. Biriyani is a hybrid of Polao and fried rice. Judging by the reviews here steer clear from it. The kebab was delicious and well cooked. The Malai kofta was soft but too sweet and tasted like a pudding. It needed flavour. Overall try their spicy dishes and kebabs but stay away from biriyani and moderate flavoured dishes. Not worth more than a single visit.

3 of us went to this place a few nights ago and found it completely empty. However the food didn't dissapoint. We ordered the Galauti, Pasinda and Jugalbandi kebabs and followed it up with a Mutton biriyani and Kheema biriyani. The kebabs were tasty and rich in spices. Mutton biriyani was as it should be but the letdown was the Kheema biriyani. Overall an enjoyable dinner.

This is a small easy-to-miss place, but a hidden gem! 

The usual Kakori, galouti, pasanda are all on the menu & all done really well! Not overly spiced to kill the flavour but just right; the mutton biryani, tho tasty had just one chunk of meat which was tough & chewy, so a tad disappointing.
 The chicken dubba had a few pieces of green chilli floating in it, but tasted great! Shahi tukda was oversweet & firni not available, so dessert was a letdown after a great meal.

A group of 65 ladies booked for lunch on 15th  December  2016. Ladies between the ages of 45 to 80 . The seating arrangements were not up to the mark.  They could not accommodate 65 people  so they put in more stools and made the place clumsy.  The starter's  were very good although  the tandoori fish was under done. The main food was just OK.  The desert of firni and sahi tukra was awful.

This restaurant is located just off Ballygunge Circular Road in a quiet residential locality. The decor attempts to recreate the Awadhi feel. Customer service is above par. We ordered food but decided to take it home to eat it. Our dinner comprised 
Garlic Butter naan - much thinner and therefor lighter than the naan we usually get
Lucknowi paratha - a light paratha which went well with the accompaniments
Mutton Galouti kebab - one of the better versions of the kebab the city has to offer 
Mutton Pasinda - my family enjoyed it but I didn't particularly enjoy the texture 
Chicken cheese malai kebab - cheesy and non-spicy - kids would love it!
Minced chicken (can't remember the exact name) very interesting flavours 

The food was a little heavy but very enjoyable and satisfying. Look forward to visiting again

The place was empty. They could not explain the location on the phone. The place was empty for obvious reasons. The phone kept ringing loudly and noone bothered to answer. The chef played the role of waiter too. Lucknowi aloo was decent but kofta was dismal. Not even worth trying...

Wanna visit this place soon. Ordered in food from here for dashami. I was hesitant about it but absolutely loved the food. I ordered the Handi Biriyani and Lucknowi chaap for myself. The mutton piece was soft and oh-so-tasty. The food was well packed and piping hot when it arrived. 
Must go there soon to try out more from their menu.

we ordered 
mutton burra - it wasn't upto mark. too much of red tandoori colors were used and wasn't  cooked properly.
Galauti - it was good and at par with the taste of Oudh.
Biriyani - wasn't at all awadhi and taste was bad too.
overall experience: okayish. not great at all.

Lucknow is a farce. They just got the name right, but everything else wrong. I ordered a side of Kakori Kebabs along with Rumali Rotis, for I expected it to be authentic. But it was the worst experience I've had eating Kakori. They actually managed to shatter my image of what the regular Kakori is like in Calcutta. I hope there aren't any others with such false advertising.

The ranking is for the ambience and decor as we could not eat a meal here. This was due the fact that the choice for veg dishes was too less ad 90% of the dishes were non- veg. hopefully they will introduce more items in veg menu and then we can again think of visiting the place

A part of the popular Naushi Jaan franchise , Lucknow is an exercise in disbelief. Located in the lane opposite Deodar Street (off Ballygunge Circular Road) , it is probably the only restaurant which has been empty every single time I've visited. I wonder how they sustain day-to-day costs with such poor/non-existent footfall.

Food is definitely below par. Kebabs are decent enough , but the Biryani is a total washout - nothing like the Awadhi cuisine which is promises. Naan was a little tough and the Mutton was definitely under salted. Would not recommend this place.

This is a place near my home and I have got food delivered a couple of times. Their biriyani tastes completely Different and is so yummy. I was so used to having the same style of biriyani whether it was in Alibaba or Arsalan or Zeeshan or Lazzez. But this is what I have been looking for ages. I had ordered a Parda biriyani and Lucknow seekh Kabab. The Biriyani was moist and packed with flavor. I was a little dissapointed with the size and the quantity of the kababs compared to the cost but the pudina chuti made up for it. Amazing place. I plan on visiting this place soon.

I accidentally discovered this joint, and trust me I have never been so happy about an "accident" before in my life. My friend and I were desperately looking for Biriyani and driving around Ballygunge Circular Road when Zomato helped us discover Lucknow. Ohhhh!!! Wat food, Wat kebabs!!! Wat decor!!! From Galawati with Lucknowi paratha to Adrak-ke-Panje to Handi Biriyani we just relished it all. Everything is perfect about this joint, except one thing... The location. Would you believe I lived just two lanes away till about couple of months back and never knew this place. It's a little inside a lane(sort of a dead end) and there is no visible signage on the main road. So please spread the word and direct people to this amazing place... Am returning soon, for sure.

We went on Saturday evening at 830 and to my surprise, we were the only guests...during the next 90 mins, another family came in to dine,We tried 3 types of Kebabs, Galawti, Malai Tikka and Kakori....they were good though a bit over spicey .....the Handi Biriyani is more of a Pulao with Mutton added to it and does not really taste like Biriyani.The Firni was good, and the Shahi Tukda ( I am not a fan of the item at all ) was tried by someone else and was apparently a bit too sweet.The décor is nice and innovative and service was good, but we could see only 1 person during the entire 90 mins, not sure if there are many diners out there, how they are going to handle...Prices are on the higher side, compared to places serving items od similar standard.

I came here today for a birthday party.  The entire restaurant was booked for it. It is really pretty with awadhi decoration and interior.  The only negative for them I feel is that it is way too inside from the main road. If one is going by a car or cab it's fine but if you take a bus and get down at ballygunj phari then it is far. As you have to walk a lot to reach the place. 
Both veg and non veg starters were really good. We had reshmi, tikka and hariyali chicken kebab. And in veg there was paneer and stuffed alu kabab. Both the veg and non veg kebabs were cooked to perfection with perfect seasoning. In the main course ALL THE dishes were lipsmacking. Hats off to the chef. There was veg noodles, veg handi biriyani, chili chicken, mutton galouti kabab, 1 chicken side dish and 1 mutton side dish whose names I have forgotten. Then there was soft paratha, mixed dal, paneer and malai kofta. Veg and non veg dishes were equally good. For dessert there was sahi tukda and firni. Not overtly sweet but done to perfection.  Oo oo and unlimited cold drinks as well. :-)
Hats off to the owner and chef. Advertise a bit more and you will go to places.

Its a must visit for Foodies! Perfectly laid out with cots and sofas, it feels you are at home relaxing with your friends. The ornate designs on the door, the soothing lighting and above all the food will simply take you to the world of the Nawabs. We went there with old buddies and the finger licking kebabs were our best accompaniments. We started off with Chilli Ginger Mojito and we were just bowled over. A happy nuptial knot of chiilies, mint and ginger wiped all our urban woes.After a session of hookah, we were pampered with Jugalbandi, Kakori and Galauti Kebab. The softness of the kebabs were mindblowing. I recommend it to all foodies out there. A Great place to hang out and have authentic Awadhi cuisine!

being a vegetarian, a visit to luknow famous for its non vegetaian dishes was a delight. The ambiance was great and best of all the vegetarian food was awesome. just to name a few the paneer gulnar, mushroom malai tikka just melted in the mouth, the paneer makhana was just out of the world, the mawa naan, naushijaan biryani, the shahi masala pulao were all superb.we finished off with the shahi tukra and sweet tooth. A must visit place for all foodies.......... highly recommended. A good place to have a get together.

Went for late night dinner with friends..very cosy ambience..we ordered banana milkshake, masala chaas & fresh lime..chaas was a bit too spicy fr my taste..everything else was good..
We ordered galauti kebab, a fish kebab & parathas fr starters..parathas were light n yummy( you can just have them without sides) & the fish was also perfect..galauti was good too.. For mains we ordered a handi biryani & a spinach chicken biryani..have to say the spinach biryani was awsome..spicy n hot but the spinach balanced it out nicely..
All in all definitely a place to try out..as for me i am going back any chance i get..
The only downside is the location..its inside a side road off the main road n can b easily missed..there is a sign though if u keep an eye out..definitely worth a visit..

Took the advantage of Zomato's latest feature for online orders through the app and was pleasantly surprised that an order could be placed really late at night ( at least for Kolkata standard ) , around 10:20 pm! 
Very few places agree for home delivery at this hour! 
Didn't order anything fancy, just a chicken seekh kebab, butter nun and and dal Makhani. 
Staff is nice and efficient, and most importantly courteous, it took them less than an hour to reach my place with the packed food, all hot and fresh. But unfortunately what I ordered just didn't appeal to my taste buds. I love North Indian dishes and the dal makhani just wasn't right according to me, excruciatingly sour and with absolutely no salt. There was no proper seasoning though I requested for a little bit of spicy food.
Chicken Seekh Kebabs were burnt beyond recognition which were dry and hard and the butter nun was thick and honestly did not even qualify as "Butter Nun", it was more or less like an oily home made paratha. 
I have read some good stuffs about this place and was rather disappointed with the food. Maybe I didn't order their signature dishes or maybe it was too late for the chef to prepare proper food. But I will surely give it another try for sure!

Went for dinner with my colleagues. I had ordered Garlic Naan and Mutton Boti for myself, while my other colleagues ordered Galowti Kabab, Handi Biryani, Luknowi Mutton Chaap. The garlic naan was really tasty, and mutton boti was delicious, with just the right amount oil unlike other restaurants where you get to see all oil instead of gravy and meat.. The biryani was alright, but could use a bit more spice in it. Galowti kabab was the best compared to all the other places that serves it, even places like The Taj, as said by my collegue. So I'm waiting to try it myself the next time. However, the place is not so popular among the locals I assume as we were the only people in the restaurant. But the taste of the food surpasses that completely.

Had dinner brought in from Lucknow on Ballygunge Circular Raod last evening for a meal with friends at home.

The menu was quite elaborate. 4 kinds of kebabs: Kakori, Naseemjani, Jugalbandi and pasinda. This led to the main meal: Mutton rezala, Nehari, Rara Chicken, Lasuni Palak and Mirchi Salan wiped down with rumali roti and Lucknow Paratha. Except the kakori to which I shall return later, the rest was succulent. Especially the Naseemjani and Jugalbandi Kebabs and the Nehari. Well worth a repeat or two.

I get the feeling that the true karigars who can do make a good kakori do not like living away from Lucknow. Restaurateurs in other cities can get a good guy but only for a limited period of time.

Rate 4 stars-large ones-out a max 5.

Went for late night dinner with friends..very cosy ambience..we ordered banana milkshake, masala chaas & fresh lime..chaas was a bit too spicy fr my taste..everything else was good..
We ordered galauti kebab, a fish kebab & parathas fr starters..parathas were light n yummy( you can just have them without sides) & the fish was also perfect..galauti was good too.. For mains we ordered a handi biryani & a spinach chicken biryani..have to say the spinach biryani was awsome..spicy n hot but the spinach balanced it out nicely..
All in all definitely a place to try out..as for me i am going back any chance i get..
The only downside is the location..its inside a side road off the main road n can b easily missed..there is a sign though if u keep an eye out..definitely worth a visit..

I got bowled over by their Chicken Rara!!! Its a beauty which I never had before. It had big chicken pieces and the curry had keema in it. We had that with thin Lucknowi parathas. We also ordered the Mutton keema biryani which was served steaming in a clay pot. The biryani had no smell of oil.
We also ordered the Shahi tukra......piece of paradise!!!!
 The price was very economic compared to the level of taste experience that they provided. 
The interiors was of lucknow tradition. So was the utensils. The people were courteous. 
Gps was needed to locate the eatery.

As the saying goes, the harder you strive the better are your results. Same goes for the patrons of this restaurant due to its interior location. But every ounce of energy lost was enthusiastically gained due to their over-the-moon food which got better and better. Came here for tasting some good old mutton biryani(which was no doubt awesome with too tender muttons) and fell in love with their ultra thin parathas combined with chicken rara, a chicken preparation akin to the chap with the gravy being made with keema. Lastly the shahi tukra blew away my girl's mind as she is pretty familiar with Royal's one, saying that this one was much better than Royal's.
Brownie points for a nice ambience, courteous staff, HOT foods and kudos in keeping the joint open beyond their scheduled hours just because we had called them up earlier, even though we were the only patrons at that time.

i was in calcutta duing the durga puja (there is nowhere else in the world you'd want to be during that time!!)  and my friends wanted all of us to visit lucknow.  they had already been there once and wouldnt stop raving about their ambience and biriyani!!     

ambience--  dimly lit with some interesting wall art depicting the mughal / awadhi era. they also served their biriyanis etc in brassware; so that wasnt bad. presentation was pretty good for all the items! 

we were a group of 8 and asked to use the exclusive room with old-style low seating and low tables which is new and interesting.         

the food--   we asked for kebabs (afghani, lasuni and malai tikka  --  1 plate of each) and all of them were soft, succulent and carried that perfect mughlai / north indian aroma.   that was the general consensus around the table; so a thumbs up to that!!         

for the main course, it was a no brainer. we all knew it'd be biriyani. we quickly made our selections- a total of 5 plates of "handi biriyani" and "keema naushijan biriyani". in my opinion, (though both tasted out of the world and was cooked in dollops of ghee), the biriyani at arsalan and shiraz would score higher. though this tasted absolutely gorgeous, it didnt have the "biriyani aroma" that a shiraz / arsalan biriyani offers! 

overall, i loved it but would like it to be called by another name than "biriyani" because it doesnt fit the taste of a "lucknawi" biriyani. 

by the time we finished with the above, we had no place for dessert. we did have a few lime sodas to wash the heavy ghee down, though!  

price--    well on the higher side considering the general price of biriyani in calcutta.  we ran up a bill of around 5k on the above.  

taste--   everything tasted fantastic subject to my judgement of "biriyani" taste and aroma.  

service--   slow; but mughlai / north indian food takes time to prepare.  so discounted.     

ambience   --   PERFECT and COOL ambience for both family, couples and friends.  (groups of 6-9 can ask for the "upstairs room").     

visit again--    probably yes when i m in calcutta next time (for the kebabs specially)

Loved this place in its previous avatar of Chhotey Nawab. The kebabs were spectacular, the biryani super, the service friendly. I did a takeaway from 'Lucknow' recently, and it was the biggest let-down ever. The kakori and galauti kebabs were really disappointing, and the biryani no better than average. The restaurant was completely empty when I went to pick up the food - not at all surprising.
