The masala dosa itself is good. The dosa is crisp. The sambhar is average.narrow space for eat.price is 35.that's very pocketfriendly.  It's always overcrowded by people.

Have been eating South Indian  here since I was a child and the taste seems to have never changed, easily the best South Indian cuisine server in Kolkata for it seems to be one of the oldest. The dosas here are amazing and also the sambar vada. Whenever we want South Indian this small street hole restaurant is what comes to my mind!!

Yes..one of the best south indian food you get here..
you would hardly notice the food joint and even if you do you wont ever feel that they would serve such good food cuz the space is minimal but the food you get here has just so perfect south indian flavours which you would hardly expect to be served..its bascially a takeaway joint though they have minimum arrangements to sit or stand and eat..yes the sitting is a bit of an issue there but the crowd which you always find there would tell you that you surely are gonna have a good meal..the quality and quantity of their food is exceptionally good..so the sitting issue can almost be totaly neglected if you consider the taste you are gonna meet with..their services are.also quiet fast..the 0.5 i deducted is just for that lack of space else its just so perfect

This is a hole-in-the-wall except that a few can stand and eat inside the long and narrow shop. There's a bench on the pavement where one can sit and eat if lucky. Else, it's stand-and-eat on the pavement of the busy Ultadanga crossing.

The masala dosa itself is average. The dosa is crisp and the filling generous. The sambhar has a little too much of tomato and too less vegetables. But it's not watery like one often gets on the street. The chutney is thick and tastes decent. The dosa cost only Rs 35. Value for money? Yes.

To sum up, it's halfway decent south Indian food at cheap prices.

It's undoubtedly the best place to eat South Indian food in Calcutta!I have been in many Indian cities over the years and Dosa is one of my most favourite food, I have had it at almost all of the places, but the way they make it here at South Indian Best Food is absolutely amazing! One of those lip-smacking food joints and everything here is worth a try once!Although it's a really small and congested place - that doesn't take away from the fact that it serves the best South Indian food I personally have ever eaten!Idly, Vada, Uttapam are really yummy and should be tried at least once. However, my most favourite here is the Butter Masala Dosa! They don't shy away from applying butter and their dosas are always red and crispy, almost all the 20+ times that I've eaten there over the years.I, along with one of my friend have made it a monthly event to visit this place after college hours and have our dose of Butter Masala Dosa and Butter Onion Dosa respectively! 😋Right near this small joint is a sugarcane juice shop, where we have our share of the juice and head back home.

South Indian food has become an important add-on cuisine be it a roadside dhaba or a five-star hotel.  Its tangy smell of herbs and spices, with lots of organic preparations, you get it almost every corner of the  country today.  However, the best way to enjoy is to go to exclusive outlets that serve south Indian food.  In Chandigarh,  I love to be at Sundarams South Indian food for truly authentic south Indian dishes.

This small South Indian eatery is located at Ultadanga . It has no sitting arrangements, it's basically a take away joint.

Ambience is shabby and crowdy.

Service is prompt.

Tried Butter onion Sada Dosa , which was crispy and was palatable. 

Pocket pinch is economical.

Sitting is like a bench in the footpath where 3 to 4 ppl can sit. 
But I must say lovely food . The taste is authentic. The pocket pinch is very less. 
We ordered 
Maslaa dosha : no kanjusi in masala . It tasted as gud as branded south Indian outlets.
Vada : 2 big vada in sambar and coconut chutney at the side. 
I can't point out a single problem with the food.

Smaller the place is, tastier the dosas are. I have eaten the best masala dosas here. Though the place is very very very small, smaller than your bathroom , hardly two people can cross each other at the same time. You have to stand and eat , otherwise you can take away , though dosas are at there best when eaten immediately . Would have given a 4.5 star for just the taste of dosas, but space matters , so minus 1.5 points.

Nothing much to fuss about !! Running South Indian Dishes here for long time. A very small outlet situated very near to Ultadanga footbridge. Almost a lane line shop. Service is quick. No sitting facility available. Due to heavy rush most of the time. You have to sit outside to dine in there. Average quality food. 
Masala Dosa served here with basic sambhar and chutni..
Pocket Friendly Prices.

Presentation was good. Price was pocket friendly. I tried their masala dosa which was tasty and their sambhar & chatni were also very tasty. They serve only dhosa, idli, vada and uttapam in pocket friendly price & which tastes also good. Must try place. Recommended to all.

It's almost unbelievable how this restaurant has shatteled into such a small place & still delivers some wonderful foods. A very small lane of Ultadanga is converted to this South Indian Food joint & its very easy to miss at first time. Undoubtedly there is no place for sittings but somehow they have managed a little place where you can stand & eat.

They have a short menu to choose from some South Indian delights & seeing the crowd at office times you would expect everything good over here. Tried their Masala Dhosa & Masala Uttapam. Both the dishes were served on a Banana leaf in a traditional way. Dhosa was crispy fried, nicely filled with veg masala inside & wonderful at taste. Where Indian pizza or Uttapam was very well made & delicious at taste. Served coconut chatni & sambar with it was out of this world. Their excellent food was like to fall in love with.

Just like their name South Indian Best Food, they really deliver some best quality south indian foods. Not only that, their pricing for all the dishes are very very reasonable & with the wonderful food quality it becomes a Value for Money regular restaurant for nearby office goers.

A small South Indian food joint - easily to be missed in the crowded footpath of Ultadanga for pedestrians or passersby can easily walk past it and fail to notice it -  selling dosa, idli, uttapam etc. which you get at very cheap prices. Have had takeouts of their plain dhosa, masala dhosa, onion sada dhosa, vada, idli a number of times. Dosas are crisp, soft, crunchy. The sambar is always fresh and tasty, as is the light broth they provide with dosas. For Dakshini quick bites that do not exactly burn a hole in one's pocket, this place can be checked out by foodies whose faves are South Indian street food/roadside snacks.

Location: Ultadanga Crossing.

This little South Indian joint is located in a sandwiched manner near the Ultadanga crossing and adjacent to a popular electrical appliance showroom. This joint is nothing more than a hole in the wall that too vertical in design where only people could stand and eat on the wall-side table. Barely does it have space for movement. There definitely is a bench outside on the pavement to accommodate a few more. Best is to do a takeaway.

About the FOOD, as the name suggests, this place serves South Indian fare of which the following was ordered:

- Idli
The Idli was soft, nicely steamed and good to eat.

- Vada
'Slightly burnt and Oily with zero crispness' piece it was. Disappointed. One could give it an easy miss.

- Masala Dosa
The Dosa was crisp at the edges and soft towards the center with a flavorful filling of sautéed mashed potatoes. Good to taste.

- Coconut Chutney
The chutney was flavorful and had a semi-thick consistency. Tasted good.

- Sambhar
Wished for the flavors to be a little more stronger, nevertheless was decent to taste. Have had better and this one has a scope of improvement.

The SERVICE by the untrained yet, friendly STAFF was prompt.
PRICES were found to be set at the reasonable end.

Overall was a decent experience with respect to the food.
Accounting the other parameters, this place wouldn't score above a rating of 3.
- Definitely not a place to visit with family! :P
Wish to make your family taste the fare? Takeaway please. :)

You can hardly locate this place just beside Sony Ultadanga because the place is microscopic. You would be very lucky to manage a sit on the bench outside. After fighting for a place when you finally get your order you will be feeling like in heaven. The masala dosa is better than any outlet in Kolkata. All the trouble to fit yourself in a corner will be worth fully. Just a 30 bucks dosa can give u full breakfast.  Very pocket friendly and its the best South Indian outlet in North Calcutta. One thing I don't like about this place is that they are exploiting child labour.

Space is no factor …

Yes…. You have to keep this sentence on ur brain if you willing to visit this place. Just 1 minute walking from Ultadanga crossing sony centre towards station. If you lov south Indian food then you can press button. Masala Dosa, Idly / Bora you can have here @ a reasonable price. 1 south Indian man look after the order along with 1 kid helper… well behave. There is a wooden bench on outside of the store as small sitting arrangement. Take a sit first the man will come to you and ask your order. Within 5 to 10 minute you will get your food, also you can take away if you want.

A must visit food corner....  real & only South Indian taste within budget.

This tiny restaurant is located a few shops away from Sourav's and serves strictly vegetarian south Indian staples like dosa , idli and uttapam . Their dosa is very popular among the young and middle aged working crowd and college students who come here for a quick bite. The onion sada dosa was crispy ,with a light chopped onion filling inside and was served with sambar and coconut chutney . The space inside is really clumsy and the shop has a singular slab running along the side where the food is served. Along with that there's a bench outside ! But if you manage to look beyond the lack of space , it's quite a decent eatery with amazingly pocket friendly prices ! Try it once ! Or everyday , if you please ..

It's a very small place in Ultadanga just few shops from Sony World. This place makes most of the popular South Indian dishes like idly, vada, dosa etc. Eating area is very small and isn't very hygienic. But apart from all this, full marks to their soft idlis, crunchy and savory vadas, crispy dosas combined with delicious sambhar and perfectly soothing chutney. Very crowded during office breaks and evening hours but make sure you try this once...

This small joint a few shops just before sony world has been my place for sunday breakfast for the last 7-8 years.
The dosa's the idli or the vada is the best in the city i believe.
The only problem being its pretty crowded and has no room for eating .
The sambar and chutney are the main attraction.
Go try the butter mota dosa or the uttapam i am sure you will not be disappointed
Keep munching

The only thing  it being a streetside eatery located in the crowded vicinity of bidhannagar station should arrange for a better seating .. Recommended if u want  to go for authentic south indian snacks and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket :)

Located beside sony showroom on ultadanga crossing, it is a very small joint serving good south indian food but in an uncomfortable surrounding if one considers eating it here itself. It is a narrow but a bit deep shop with kitchen on far end, and a long rack on the other wherein one could keep the plates while eating. 3-4 people could stand inside and others have to stand outside on the sidewalk which is very rushy most of the time.

Coming to food, dosas are pretty good with decent masala if you opt for. I liked there butter masala dosa which was well buttered and was crisp. The chutney was really good but in a really small bowl so had to keep asking for it. The idli is pretty average but dosas are their speciality.

I would prefer eating here only when i am nearby and real hungry, plus when the weather is merciful otherwise better for a takeaway. Not that i do not like standing roadside for south indian food, but this place feels stuffy inside and rushy outside.

Our favorite place to satisfy the hunger pangs after office . Forever hot and delicious Sambhar and thick coconut chutney welcomes you to this small but awesome shop . The vada is unlike any other in the city . And the dosa are so crisp that you can't have just one .

A full tummy in less than Rs. 60 i say , is Oh So Calcutta :)

P.S.: They weren't joking when they named it "Best" . It is literally .

This place is heaven for South Indian food. It's a small lane type shop with counter top to eat delicious southern delicacies cooked by real ANNA. I'm a huge fan of this little eatery since my teen age.

They don't have variety of dosas but whatever they serve it's awesome to have, starting from masala dosa, butter sada dosa to idly and uttapam. Prices have increased greatly since I first visited here. That time for 12 bucks they used to serve masala dosa now it's 22 bucks which I think is fair enough. It's the best place to have South Indian food around this area with a pocket friendly price tag on the food menu. It is even better than Sourav's dosa which I feel quite bland.

During lunch and evening this place attracts lot of crowd and it is very difficult to control your hunger as the scrumptious smell of the food will make you crazy. Space is a real let down here as there is very limited space for one to stand and have food. But who cares when you have great food in front of you. Service is real quick and one doesn't need to wait for long.

Next time when you are at Ultadanga and need to cool off your hunger feast don't look further head to South Indian Best Food.

As the name goes they truly serve the best south indian food in Kolkata. The place is very small with hardly any place to stand and therez alwayz a long queue but itz worth the wait. I had Idli and Butter Masala Dhosa and I visit this place frequently. The Idli they serve is very soft and tasty. Butter Masala Dhosa is just beautiful with the smell of butter all over and it tastes so good. The sambar they provide is tasty but I had better sambar in Bengaluru. The chutney is what I am fan of. This is a must visit place in Kolkata for people who like South Indian food.

Butter Masala Uttappam - Well this is a full lunch/dinner item. The masala looked as if burnt but it wasn't. This dish may not seem pretty but is very very tasty. The feel of the butter along with the masala is very nice. The uttappam base is also well cooked and tasty. Recommended for everyone. Also see that it takes around 15-20 mins to serve this dish.
