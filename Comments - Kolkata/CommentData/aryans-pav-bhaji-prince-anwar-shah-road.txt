Location is just beside South City Mall. The place remain mostly crowed all the time. I visited here for Pav Bhaji. Taste was average. The cost seemed higher on other end. The place doesn't have a good seating arrangement. Extra pav cost Rs.10.

I love pav bhaji, and this is a very ideal place to have some good pav bhaji. A small stall with well behaved staff, and lighting fast service. A very nice experience everytime I visit this place. The rates aren't that high, and the quality is very good. Keep up the good work.

This is the pav bhaji stall situated around the entrance of South City Mall. It's mostly crowded. The pav bhaji tastes average at best. Still they charge approx 60-70 bucks for it and 10 bucks for an extra pav. That's rather off-putting.

At one corner of the traffic junction of South City Entrance, is located Aryan's Pav Bhaji. Tried out their Pav Bhaji, tasted to very average. One plate of Pav Bhaji costs Rs.60 which also seemed to me much higher then the standard its serving. Pav was ordinary and had very less butter on it. The sabji that came with neither created any impression.
There is 2-3chairs to seat. And if thats full you have to stand and have your food. The isn't much clean.

There is not much seating available. you have to stand and eat.you will find people coming out of the mall and having pav bhaji here. So this place remains mostly crowded. Still they serve you quickly. The pav bhaji is good though nothing special.Can give it a try.

This eatery is located just beside South city 
mall & may even go unnoticed unless you know about its existence..I 
had discovered this place on zomato & decided to try the pav bhaji 
from here.The curry was not bad..though I've had better elsewhere.The 
bread wasn't fried properly..prices are damn cheap.Pav bhaji lovers can 
give it a try..though the name is 'Aryan's pav bhaji' yet i feel their 
momos are much better than their pav bhaji..& the soup that comes 
alongside is also good.

This is a small street side eatery close to south city mall which offers mouth-watering pav bhaji's as goes the name Aryan's pav bhaji. I sometimes eat here when i am broken after a shopping spree. The full plate comes for 60 which is enough for one person. They also have steamed momos but i would recommend pav bhajis which are really good.

Been there quite a few time and i feel this is the best pav bhaji joint of the country.... considering the mumbai shops... the taste is awsome. Love it all the way. And it is cheap.
