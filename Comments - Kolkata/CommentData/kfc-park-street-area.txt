Being a fried chicken lover Kfc is my ultimate destination.This place never disappointed me.Tried there every item almost..The legendary crispy fried chicken doesn't need any description..But one must try there Smoky Grilled Chickens as well. By adding this in the menu Kfc just wins several foodies heart for sure.

Best value for money fast food, the combo deals they make on certain days are really amazing and to look out for before you order. Even without specific day (wednesday) specials a lot of their meals are well planned and fulfilling.
Also the food comes really well packaged, you can easily order it to work or places where you won't get proper culinary dishes.¬†
There is nothing really to say from the taste perspective everyone knows KFC, its that same finger linkin good food coming to your doorstep.

Oh btw,
If you want you can also order fries by calling but they give no guarantee for quality¬† and sometimes the fries do come half crushed xd, but its cool because they clearly mention it.

This is situated at the heart of the city, and thus my most visited. I'd like to say how commendable it is that people with speech and hearing disabilities find ready employment here. One may assume that it may create a problem while taking orders, but really it doesn't. They welcome you with a smile and swiftly serve whatever is pointed out on the menu card. And if any problems do arise, other servers are happy to help out. Yes, it's crowded and the queues can be long, but it's KFC - I don't mind waiting a bit. The food is as delicious as at any outlet - the chicken crispy strips, chicken popcorn, chicken rice bowl, chicken twister, chicken zinger, krushers and the ice creams are all favourites of mine. A hearty meal at reasonable prices.

KFC is one of the best American brands to hit the city, and this outlet never fails to satisfy.

If you crave for some good juicy burgers you indeed think of McDonalds first. But KFC now can do you justice too with their huge range of wonderful crispy chicken stuffed burgers! 
Burgers are my stress busters, so I landed up at this branch of KFC on the evening of my last exam, we had a 
* Chicken Zinger Meal (comprising of the burger itself with fries n a coke)
* Potato Crisper Meal (comprising of the same) 
* Chicken Popcorn (All-time favourite)
* Some extra fries ('Cos Why not?)
I tried the potato Crisper for the first time , it was quite filling. There's a subtle Indian spice flavour in the sauce that makes it go all yumza. 
The Zinger had to be good. It's their signature burger. 
Apart from these, I've tried the rice bowlz at KFC. To be honest, I liked both the chicken n veg bowlz but they could do a bit more justice with the quantity of it. 
Overall satisfied. :)

KFC is known to all. Their speciality lies in their fried chicken. The burger is worth the money too. If you're not a burger person then there is a variety of rice bowls to try out. Also try out their krushers !

Always a go-to place, especially for it's location. Crowds gather most of the times owing to the same reason. But, yes, service is a tad bit slow, which can make you wait a while amidst people having those enticing chicken meals.

I thought I won't write a review but I changed my mind...I am very offended with the park street outlet..we went there two weeks back with my friends..
First of all,there was no empty seat..after some time whenever any customer finishes their meal, no sweeper was available to make the seat suitable for further use..we were tolerating such things..
Now the second thing is the menu..we went there on an 'Wednesday'..the official pages of kfc on facebook and instagram shows some menu, those were not available in the shop..we ate a combo pack which gives 10 pieces of boneless strips, 4pieces wings ,french fries and cola worth of 550/- inclusive tax..we were three people ate 4 pieces of chicken strips each spending 550/- with some french fries..
This is my humble request is that please don't show those menus on your official pages on social sites which you are not providing..please. we people are so much social media addicted, so we always collect information from social media..it always grows the misconception only, nothing else..thank you

*Everything fried*
It indeed is finger licking good! 
Since it's closer to my work place it's almost like our canteen.. Whenever we feel like having something fried KFC is the place we opt for. 
The chick-a-share bucket is really economic and filling for 3 people. 
Hot and crispy chicken/wings is the preparation I always opt as I did not like the grilled variety that much. 
So on a rainy or a cold evening if you feel like having something fried. You know where to go!

Yet another KFC review. This particular outlet is located opposite peter cat and the good thing is that it is quite spacious. The service is satisfactory too and the tables are cleared in quick time. As far as the food is concerned, its standard KFC fare. I love the chicken here but absolutely hate the burgers (which are flaky and fall apart just like most of the other KFC‚Äôs in the country).

I think this is the worst of all the KFC outlets I've ever visited till date. The only thing worth mentioning is that this outlet is quite spacious. Service is slow and the whole place is dirty. They seem to clean the table only after the customer asks for it (several times). The washroom is totally unclean. Given the place where this outlet is situated, such poor management was absolutely not expected. Extremely disappointed.

I am simply in love with this outlet of KFC situated just opposite to Peter Cat. This has been my go to place during my school days and even now i give this a shot if i am nearby because this joint never fails to satisfy me.
Ambience:_ spacious place though crowded during lunch and evening hours. Clean atmosphere. There is a private place for parties. We once held a party here consisting of almost 15 people and they accomodated us well.
Staff:_ good and well trained polite staff. Even the cleaning staffs are also very active and cleans the table as soon as one vacates it. The washroom is also cleaned enough.

Food:__ the actual reason for love! Kfc food delivered has the actual element of 'fingerlicking' factor here. Items tried over the years üòã:_

Hot n Crispy chicken - crumb fried chicken which is an absolute love. Too delicious and a good deal in terms of budget.

Smoky grilled chicken - this new introduction is also very good. Though i find it a bit too spicy for my taste but it nevertheless tastes awesome.

Chicken popcorn- this is my absolute fav. If you are on tight budget and wish for a treat this is the very item you need to order. Comes in various package sizes this item i can go absolute bonkers over. Small crumb coated spicy chicken on which you r bound to drool. Definitely recommended.

Potato snacker:_ this was another winner of their menu for a quick snack. Don't know why they took it out of menu. Would definitely love to see it back.

Chicken rockin:_ a filling burger with good chicken pieces inside. Tastes very good. Recommended.

Zinger chicken burger and zinger deluxe:_ again one of my most favourites. Almost every order of mine consists of one of these. Juicy chicken pieces and hashbrowns filling with mayonnaise sauce, lettuce and cheese slices make these an awesome treat for the taste buds. These are very heavy as well so it always satisfies my hunger calls. Absolutely recommended.

Chizza:__ My Most favourite dish of KFC. Layers of boneless chicken topped with delicious melted cheese served with your choice of sauce _classic or chili. This is an absolute winner. I can go on about this particular dish for hours actually i am so much in love with it! Recently i do not notice it in their menu. I sincerely hope they get back with the dish.

Longer burger_ now this is one of the pocket friendly yet not so satisfactory dish as i find it a bit dry.

Chick 'n' roll _ another budget friendly option which tastes well and can be tried more than once.

Rice bowls_ good amount of rice with choice of chicken available to satisfy hunger pangs. Although i find the rice quality of this particular joint is a bit lower than their Quest mall outlet.

Double Down_ yess! The double down. I was most happy when KFC actually came with the double down the previous month. I have always wanted to try this. This is basically a burger without any buns. That is there is lettuce and cheese filling sandwiched between chicken fillets. This is just love! Quantity is huge to say the least at the price charged. It almost serves as dinner. Lots of thanks to kfc for introducing this.

Apart from these there are various meal boxes which are very tasty filling and also value for money. Those even come with a choco pie_ the cute part of it. The bucket meals are also good. All the items are served very fresh in this outlet.

Krushers:_ another reason for opting kfc. These are just heaven. Have tried :_

7up lime soda _good one.

Virgin mojito:_ awesome to say the least. Recommended.

Alphonso burst:_ go for it in the summers or loose some precious delights of life. Its creamy mango texture is just heaven on the warm days.

Strawberry storm:_ good texture. Though i do not like strawberry much myself this never fails to delight me.

Chocolash:_ quite good. Creamy texture. Surely a must hit for choclate lovers.

Watermelon mojito:_ from a summer cooler special menu. Tastes awesome. Do try it.

Ice black mojito:_ another summer cooler which tastes heaven. Recommended.

Choco Tiramisu:_ a fairly new introduction and a sure winner. I am also in love with this one. It texture alone wins the contest. Very tasty. Surely recommended.

Will keep visiting to try different items and i do encourage others to go for this outlet of kfc. You surely won't be disappointed.

There was a long queue when I entered the place and it took me good 15 minutes to get my orders placed . I ordered for the internet storming " double down " and chicken fried roll meal with my staple large pepsi . The guy took my order calmly but made good enough mistakes , he placed order for a medium pepsi and chicken popcorn instead of fried roll . I completed my payment after which I got my receipt which clearly showed me the mistakes after which I reached out to him immediately and he humbly clarified the matter and agreed to return the extra Amount back . The sitting area was entirely occupied and after pondering here and there , I finally managed a decent sitting place. Coming to the orders placed , chicken fried roll was nothing special but hats off to the concept of double down , the entire food item was weighty and I found it later problematic to finish off the entire thing . Thankfully my friend and I were sharing it.  Coming to their bathroom area , I felt so yuckish to wash my hands over there since the entire washbasin area was wet with water whether it's the floor or the mirror and the place was stinking like anything . The maintenance of washroom is extremely poor and I am doubtful about the hygiene in there total. Please please look after the hygiene matter . Otherwise thumbs up for the courteous staffs there . Special mention goes to the differently abled staffs who are prompt in their services whether it's presenting the order on time or cleaning away the leftovers from the tables .

I am simply in love with this outlet of KFC situated just opposite to Peter Cat. This has been my go to place during my school days and even now i give this a shot if i am nearby because this joint never fails to satisfy me.
Ambience:_ spacious place though crowded during lunch and evening hours. Clean atmosphere. There is a private place for parties. We once held a party here consisting of almost 15 people and they accomodated us well.
Staff:_ good and well trained polite staff. Even the cleaning staffs are also very active and cleans the table as soon as one vacates it. The washroom is also cleaned enough.

Food:__ the actual reason for love! Kfc food delivered has the actual element of 'fingerlicking' factor here. Items tried over the years üòã:_

Hot n Crispy chicken - crumb fried chicken which is an absolute love. Too delicious and a good deal in terms of budget.

Smoky grilled chicken - this new introduction is also very good. Though i find it a bit too spicy for my taste but it nevertheless tastes awesome.

Chicken popcorn- this is my absolute fav. If you are on tight budget and wish for a treat this is the very item you need to order. Comes in various package sizes this item i can go absolute bonkers over. Small crumb coated spicy chicken on which you r bound to drool. Definitely recommended.

Potato snacker:_ this was another winner of their menu for a quick snack. Don't know why they took it out of menu. Would definitely love to see it back.

Chicken rockin:_ a filling burger with good chicken pieces inside. Tastes very good. Recommended.

Zinger chicken burger and zinger deluxe:_ again one of my most favourites. Almost every order of mine consists of one of these. Juicy chicken pieces and hashbrowns filling with mayonnaise sauce, lettuce and cheese slices make these an awesome treat for the taste buds. These are very heavy as well so it always satisfies my hunger calls. Absolutely recommended.

Chizza:__ My Most favourite dish of KFC. Layers of boneless chicken topped with delicious melted cheese served with your choice of sauce _classic or chili. This is an absolute winner. I can go on about this particular dish for hours actually i am so much in love with it! Recently i do not notice it in their menu. I sincerely hope they get back with the dish.

Longer burger_ now this is one of the pocket friendly yet not so satisfactory dish as i find it a bit dry.

Chick 'n' roll _ another budget friendly option which tastes well and can be tried more than once.

Rice bowls_ good amount of rice with choice of chicken available to satisfy hunger pangs. Although i find the rice quality of this particular joint is a bit lower than their Quest mall outlet.

Double Down_ yess! The double down. I was most happy when KFC actually came with the double down the previous month. I have always wanted to try this. This is basically a burger without any buns. That is there is lettuce and cheese filling sandwiched between chicken fillets. This is just love! Quantity is huge to say the least at the price charged. It almost serves as dinner. Lots of thanks to kfc for introducing this.

Apart from these there are various meal boxes which are very tasty filling and also value for money. Those even come with a choco pie_ the cute part of it. The bucket meals are also good. All the items are served very fresh in this outlet.

Krushers:_ another reason for opting kfc. These are just heaven. Have tried :_

7up lime soda _good one.

Virgin mojito:_ awesome to say the least. Recommended.

Alphonso burst:_ go for it in the summers or loose some precious delights of life. Its creamy mango texture is just heaven on the warm days.

Strawberry storm:_ good texture. Though i do not like strawberry much myself this never fails to delight me.

Chocolash:_ quite good. Creamy texture. Surely a must hit for choclate lovers.

Watermelon mojito:_ from a summer cooler special menu. Tastes awesome. Do try it.

Ice black mojito:_ another summer cooler which tastes heaven. Recommended.

Choco Tiramisu:_ a fairly new introduction and a sure winner. I am also in love with this one. It texture alone wins the contest. Very tasty. Surely recommended.

Will keep visiting to try different items and i do encourage others to go for this outlet of kfc. You surely won't be disappointed.

There was a long queue when I entered the place and it took me good 15 minutes to get my orders placed . I ordered for the internet storming " double down " and chicken fried roll meal with my staple large pepsi . The guy took my order calmly but made good enough mistakes , he placed order for a medium pepsi and chicken popcorn instead of fried roll . I completed my payment after which I got my receipt which clearly showed me the mistakes after which I reached out to him immediately and he humbly clarified the matter and agreed to return the extra Amount back . The sitting area was entirely occupied and after pondering here and there , I finally managed a decent sitting place. Coming to the orders placed , chicken fried roll was nothing special but hats off to the concept of double down , the entire food item was weighty and I found it later problematic to finish off the entire thing . Thankfully my friend and I were sharing it.  Coming to their bathroom area , I felt so yuckish to wash my hands over there since the entire washbasin area was wet with water whether it's the floor or the mirror and the place was stinking like anything . The maintenance of washroom is extremely poor and I am doubtful about the hygiene in there total. Please please look after the hygiene matter . Otherwise thumbs up for the courteous staffs there . Special mention goes to the differently abled staffs who are prompt in their services whether it's presenting the order on time or cleaning away the leftovers from the tables .

For students like me the KFC is the ideal place for  some crunchy chicken and gossip. Unlike other outlets this is my favourite for its location, service and obviously the juicy tender chicken.

KFC always serves great chicken. But that's about it. The burgers they make are too dry, the bread is dry and there are not enough condiments to make it a nice moist juicy burger. The french fries are average, I have had better french fries in other places. The Krushers taste good but nothing exceptional. I would recommend they should reduce the amount of ice and make the drinks thicker. On the positive side, their double down burger is one of the best things they have ever introduced. It is lovely, crispy, juicy, cheesy and outright delicious. Hence, KFC is highly recommended for its CHICKEN only and not for rizo rice or french fries or krushers.

Am a regular here. The chicken buckets, zinger burgers, virgin mojitos are all great.
The smoky/grilled chicken is too spicy for my taste though so i stick to the hot and crispy version all the time.

Went there on Sunday evening, it had a dull gloomy empty look when entire Park Street was hustling. The reason I found out when I went to the counter to place my order. Out of the four counters... three were closed. On walking up I asked for rice bowl which they said was out of stock, then smoky chicken bucket would take time.
They should shut shops and not waste such a prime location in park street.

Situated in the Peter Cat Alley and just opposite to it in park street, this place is similar to their other outlets.We thought of trying out their newest food innovation. After chizza, fried rolls KFC have introduced a new type of bunless burger chicken double down by name. This is a startling innovation the fried chicken buns with cheese and lettuce tucked in between is a clear winner. One plate of it fulfills a person's hunger at 190INR. Unlike other fried items it's tender, succulent, juicy and spicy all at the same time. A clear winner in all sections.

KFC Parkstreet is totally disappointing, therefore leading to my lowest rating of a restaurant ever. Ordered KFC bucket at 12.50 p.m and at 3 p.m also they couldn't delivered the order to 227 AJC Bose Road from Parkstreet KFC. It is completely nonsense. No one should order online from KFC Parkstreet. Neither Zomato executives are prompt in safice customers while order are getting delivered delayed.

Visited this outlet quite a few number of times. But this time went there specifically to try out the new KFC DOUBLE DOWN!!! all chicken no bun (!) burger. The idea of a burger where the buns were made out of tender crispy chicken seemed heavenly. The first bite of this new addition to the already tempting Kfc menu felt like an extravaganza in the mouth. I tasted italian dressing, cheese, lettuce and a mouthful of that ever-loved Kfc chicken. However, after a few bites, it started to feel a bit heavy and seemed like the two layers of cheese slices were not contributing anything to the otherwise-awesome taste of the burger. It was very filling. As per my opinion, the cheese slices can be cut down or skipped completeley, grilled cheese could be added instead.

Probably the worst KFC outlet in Kolkata area, while the rest may be competent or even excellent, this outlet is bad, and when I say bad... Unhygienic, extremely slow service and stale food, had got some food as take-away and had to throw away half of it, the burger was stale. Though I was charged extra for the spicy sauce and it was not there. Half way through eating it, I found out the bun was mouldy in the base and had to throw it away. The hot wings not sure but maybe it had been deep-fried a couple of times as the outer covering was bone-hard while the meat inside was dry as a desert.
Such a terrible experience that I had to log in here after such a long time, just to review this place.
Avoid at all costs.

Unlike all the outlets of KFC , this Park Street one is completely unhygienic to be in. Firstly, the workers are not so attentive to your order and switch it with some other. Secondly ,the tables are not properly wiped even when we asked them twice to do so. Being helpless and getting no option whatsoever I myself cleansed it with a tissue.
And the most disgusting part was the washroom. KFC has people for cleaning it up but I don't know why it was like this. The washroom was so dirty that you can't even imagine. Had it been during the pujas or any rush hours I could have understood that it was not possible to clean but I went on a weekday and that too after puja. So disappointed with my visit over there.

We ordered chicken longer and mingles bucket. It was our second visit at kfc for we were really impressed with their idea of mingles bucket. I must add that one can actually fathom the difference of quality between this outlet and the other outlets of kfc.The chicken were juicy and fresh. It was served hot in a really short-term period. The mayonnaise dip left a creamy and mushy charm in our tastebuds. The staffs are humbled with their guests and really nice ambiance, not so crowdy. Sweet melodies were playing in the background which made the visit more enjoyable. This is probably the best outlet of kfc in Kolkata.

This is the first time I am so disparagingly disappointed with a KFC outlet, therefore leading to my lowest rating of a restaurant ever... KFC has always been my favourite place for a hangout which successfully satiates the tastebuds at the same time but my oh my! I'm never stepping foot in this outlet again rest assured.
First of all, the staff was unimpressive to say the least. As for the food, it was close to a train wreck. The zinger burger was a clear throw away of money... All it consisted of was chicken... THAT'S IT!! As readers would understand from the picture that I have uploaded along with my review, the burger lacked lettuce, cheese or anything that moistens the palate. We could not take a second bite of it, that's how horrible it was.
The chicken fried roll was okay... Not perfect like the new market outlet one where I had first tasted it but yes, it was undoubtedly edible...
As for the choco tiramisu krusher, it was surely very delectable and was the only reason I did not drop my rating below 2.
If you are a KFC fan... Try avoiding this place...that's all I can recommend...

Had gone thr yesterday with my frnd.. the place was not so busy.. had ordered for zinger burger meal box n chicken roll..
The roll was awesome and zinger buger is my all time favorite.  
Well , I really liked they service as my food was delivered to my table.. only negative feedback is that the tables were not cleaned properly..

Went here after a movie with friends. Ordered a platter of things, out of which I found Chizza to be worth mentioning. This cheezy chicken pizza was a treat to the taste buds.

This the average restaurant of KFC in town. They talk a bit long time from other KFC . The staff is very slow and not so irresponsible that most of the time something will be missing  from your order.

We ordered chicken longer and mingles bucket. It was our second visit at kfc for we were really impressed with their idea of mingles bucket. I must add that one can actually fathom the difference of quality between this outlet and the other outlets of kfc.The chicken were juicy and fresh. It was served hot in a really short-term period. The mayonnaise dip left a creamy and mushy charm in our tastebuds. The staffs are humbled with their guests and really nice ambiance, not so crowdy. Sweet melodies were playing in the background which made the visit more enjoyable. This is probably the best outlet of kfc in Kolkata.

This is the first time I am so disparagingly disappointed with a KFC outlet, therefore leading to my lowest rating of a restaurant ever... KFC has always been my favourite place for a hangout which successfully satiates the tastebuds at the same time but my oh my! I'm never stepping foot in this outlet again rest assured.
First of all, the staff was unimpressive to say the least. As for the food, it was close to a train wreck. The zinger burger was a clear throw away of money... All it consisted of was chicken... THAT'S IT!! As readers would understand from the picture that I have uploaded along with my review, the burger lacked lettuce, cheese or anything that moistens the palate. We could not take a second bite of it, that's how horrible it was.

The kfc zinger burger was not packed well. Burgers used to come in a box and this time it was just wrapped in a paper and squashed with the weight of another food box. Its cheese was all over and it was gross to watch. Otherwise the food was good.

Have been a KFC lover since 2007, however, yesterday's experience will make me think if I will visit this joint again... 

While me and my wife popped in for a late evening snacks and expected to have great experience what we experienced was not at all KFC like...

We ordered hot and crispy chicken, zinger burger and Pepsi, here is what we experienced-
1. Hot and crispy chicken was quite hot but instead of being crispy it was more stif... The taste was quite unlike the signature KFC like and was really horrible...
2. What was more surprising is the Zinger burger... The bread seemed to be stale and the bottom half was greyish in colour... The patty inside was almost all flour and no chicken... I thought I am really lucky though to have found a tiny piece of chicken inside it and maybe that is why they charged ‚Çπ150...
3. The best thing to have was Pepsi and we were really glad that all was not bad.

A real awful experience...

Kfc is my all time favourite...the parkstreet kfc is a very big one it has got two floors. The food is very tasty ...but the only thing i hate is they take too much tax...if i order something of rs 150 that ll end up being 230(approx). But otherwise the food is very good...Wednesday they offer various combo meals like buddy combo, mingle box, etc. They have also introduced many new items like Chizza, chilli chizza, etc...overall kfc is a good place for foid and fun.

Like any other KFC outlet, average in taste and overpriced. 
The meals are a saviour though..I love the combos. 
The popcorn chicken is the only thing that still tastes good,rest of them have kind of degraded in taste. 
Once we visited when there was a birthday party going on in the reserved space...it was horrible with all the disturbance.

Location:  Opposite Peter cat.
 KFC is an American fast food restaurant‚Äã chain that specialises in fried  chicken. This  particular outlet of KFC has two floors and is very spacious. The behaviour of the staff's is very polite and service is prompt. 
The mango krushers and zinger burgers which they serve is my favourite. Also the chizza they offer is absolute  lipsmacking. Their combo meals also comes with a decent amount and price too.
 I have been to this outlet numerous times. The pocket pinch is moderate. Overall happy with the experience.

Barring the facility to sit and chat for hours in a spacious outlet, nothing about this place is good. Not a big fan of KFC though. Chicken wings were stale, and if not stale, the chicken really was hard and cold. Not a degree of tenderness. Guess that may be construed as being stale.

KFC in Park Street is always hustling with activity.  We visited today, another of our several visits, on a Saturday afternoon and though the food quality remained up to expectation, the service could have been better. We had to wait for about fifteen minutes for our table to be cleared up from the last customer's visit. The staff had to be told to clean the table because they didn't pay heed to visitors awaiting at dirty tables. 
That was a turn off at the beginning of our lunch.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We have tried out Chicken Zinger burger, Popcorn chicken, 5 in 1 zinger box, Chizza, Hot and crispy bucket. Pretty much loved all of these and I must say that the Zinger burger is one of my personal favorites. Chizza was extremely tasty too but I felt it was a bit disappointing in the quantity department. The service provided by the staffs is also satisfactory.

Sayz..Situated in Park Street, the place is great as other outlets. The good thing is that it's quite spacious. Staff is good and food is great!! Just love it specially the Choco Krushers and Chizza.

Visited this place after years. It's my favorite place only for the krushers. Virgin mojito being my favorite one. And the current favorite- icy black virgin. 
But, I have a doubt - there is an offer on the buckets for ‚Çπ299, where Hot Wings of 15 wings are included. But while ordering I was told that it wasn't available for such an offer. Is it so?

KFC is a dream come true for Chicken lovers like me. The Zinger burgers are moist, crispy and fresh. Their rice dish is very appetizing. The fried chicken are seriously and literally finger licking good. Krushers are real thirst quenchers. Must go

Just like other KFC outlets in the city, this place continues the legacy of the fried chicken .The seating area accommodates quite a large number, and the place is well-maintained by the staff.Also, you have a balcony where you can sit and binge on the chicken strips!

Decor/Ambiance: average. It's a big outlet but the chairs and tables are not arranged properly.¬†

Servers/Service: The people at the counters are not very courteous, pretty blunt, very cold behaviour. This has been my complaint for almost all the KFC outlets. I don't really like the people behind the counters. The service is prompt though

Food/drinks: My high rating is definitely because of the food. KFC is a brand. There is no compromise on the quality of food they offer. I ordered a Super Sixes Bucket and an original Chizza. Both were amazing. I must say they have improved on the Chizza. The first time I had Chizza, I did not like it much because it was too spicy. Thankfully, they have introduced two different kinds of Chizzas - Original and Chilli. I am not a fan of spicy food so I loved the Original Chizza. I also ordered a Virgin Mojito for drinks. Not the best one I have had but not bad, pretty refreshing.

Overall Feedback: I understand people go to KFC just for the food but it wouldn't hurt to put on some work on the decor, right? :D Also, some music would be nice. The staff could try to be a little more polite and nicer. Anyway, if you ignore the decor and the behaviour of the staff, the food is heavenly as KFC always is. :)

First of all, didn't receive the order at all... Then too, the app is showing the food as delivered... I tried calling the restaurant itself, which was unresponsive. Cheap customer service, cheap restaurant... Such a pathetic experience.. if I could give any less ratings, then I'd have given... Worst!!!! It hs became worse than a nightmare to trust on zomato!

The visit to the Park Street KFC was long due, but, it was not easily possible due to the non-occurrences of events which might lead me to the well known area. However, one fine evening, I decided to postponed all my engagements, solely to make a visit to this outlet.

It is located on the lanes of Park Street, almost half a kilometer from the Metro. The outlet is a single stored one, but, it has been articulately designed to give a two-storey look, where the mezzanine floor is made an extra sitting area. And, just for this design, you see the rush mostly on the upper floor as compared to the ground one. The ordering place, the storage as well as the larger seating arrangement is located on the ground floor. However, the mezzanine floor is not large and is solely for used as seating arrangements.

The staffs out here, I found extremely polite, well behaved, too soft spoken and are seen to bow down while completing a sentence. Well, I felt a little uncomfortable at their bowing down but felt really nice at their other characteristics.

Standing in line, we placed an order for few burgers, one large popcorn chicken, a large french fries and couple of soft drinks. After paying them, they asked us to get seated, as it will take a little bit of time for the order to be live. I reminded them we will be sitting at top, and hence I offered to stand there asking my friend to grab a seat (as the top spot is high in demand). Still, the one who took my order, asked me to sit and they will delivered the food. Getting aroused at their courtesy, I went and made myself seated.

The order delivery took little more than 10 minutes and they delivered it to me, without me having to wave at them. The food of KFC does not need any explanation, and it was tasty as usual. The burgers were yummy, popcorn chicken was crunchy, soft drink was chilled but the french fries were not that great. I reckon that they fried it first and was waiting for other items which made it little damp.

Finishing the meal, we have had discussions as well as storming many ideas which lead to nowhere. Even though the meal was over, we did not receive any glares which would make us uncomfortable enough to leave. Spending about 20 minutes after completion of our meal, we departed from the place parting our ways.

A visit very much recommended!

Kentucky Fried Chicken is a blessing disguised as food. There is nothing that I hate about their food. Except, the service in this particular outlet tends to be slow and sometimes the washroom cleaner takes two hours to clean the washroom, thereby increasing inconvenience.

Awfully bad quality of chicken. Had crispy chicken and chicken strips( doesn't matter because, we have tried everything in different time). Don't know where they get the raw material and how long they are keeping them in refrigerator. It has no taste at all. Strips are hard as shoe. All the staffs are good and probably know the fact. KFC was not like this two three years ago. Finally We have taken the oath not to visit KFC anymore.  Salute the secret recipe with bad taste! Goodbye KFC. :(

KFC is a very popular American fast food restaurant specialized in fried chicken preparations. They have some lip-smacking recipes. I have been to several outlets numerous times and the food never disappointed me. A ZINGER BURGER is a must try, I just love it. The 5 in 1 zinger meal box is very heavy, it provides you with 2 chicken hot wings, a hash brown, zinger burger, 600ml cold drink and a choco pie. There's also a provision of exchanging the cold drink with krushers (though u have to pay some extra amount for it). The staff are very helpful and polite. They ran out of wings so they gave us popcorn chicken which was really good. The staff members even helped us get the extra 10 percent of by completing the survey for us. The ambiance is calm and peaceful, with soft lights. This outlet is very big and spacious.
The zinger meal box is reasonable, and tummy filling. Though the recipes seem to taste the same at one point. No harm in trying once!

KFC, the name originated from the place where Abraham Lincoln was born is now a brand that needs no reviewing and no explanation...

The series of outlets all over the world prove its worth... This outlet in Park Street area is also an example of its might... 

Spacious interiors, sufficient no. of tables including its first floor makes this outlet a very comfortable place to enjoy your meal... We were very thirsty while we entered this outlet so we opted for CHOCOLASH and ALPHONSO BURST krushers... The krushers not only quenched our thirst but gave us a vibe so that we could move on in a very warm and humid day...

We skipped typical Chicken meals  in this very outlet!!!

But the Park Street outlet is pretty big so it can easily handle a good crowd.

In every KFC decors are mostly similar, here it is also.

Because it's in Park Street so the ambiance inside & outside is good enough.

After getting the service I'm not happy yet because on that day the store wasn't too crowded so I guess definitely there has low streak of orders but they took near about 15mins for to making 2 Zinger & 1Chezza.

But quality, taste & any other characters which we can describe for a food is good as usual.

I have been several times at the one near my house.
I dropped in this particular outlet when went to Parkstreet for some work.
Its big and spacious and the staffs are courteous.
We had a chicken mingles box which had Chicken strips,chicken wings and chicken popcorn came with dips and a cold drinks.
All the items were delicious.
Also the rice box with smoky chicken tasted amazing.It was a bit spicy but perfectly grilled.
We had two drinks-Virgin mojito and blue ocean.
The drinks were refreshing much.
Kfc chicken will always remain my favourite.

Whatever your mood may be, I guarantee you that any one of the various non-veg meals from KFC will boost up your emotions towards extreme satisfaction. I remember this incident when there had been a strike in my college regarding placements and all and we were released at 2230. I was famished then. The only hope I've had left was KFC. I quickly rushed there. Their hospitality and food quality immediately changed my mood. So if you're looking for someplace which is just perfect, I'd recommend this one.

Have a zinger, a longer, a bucket, chizza, nashville chicken, chicken strips, rice bowl. All are too good. Although, the nashville chicken really wasn't a hit.

KFC is one of the leading fast food chain in India which is always the all time favourite spot for the teenagers.

Been there few few days ago, to celebrate one of my friend's Birthday. The location is pretty easy, just opposite of Peter Cat.

Pretty big shop and well maintained. The stuffs are fluent with their work, helpful and suggestive also.

We ordered three Chicken Zinger Burger, one Friendship Bucket with regular meal pack and 3 Mojitos.

Burgers were good in tastes but the chicken patty was not juicy enough. Overall ok.

The Friendship Bucket consist of three Hot & Crispy chicken, three Hot Wings, three pieces of Boneless Stripes and Chicken Popcorn. All were good in tastes and like the Hot & Crispy Chicken. It was too good.

Mojitos were refreshing in tastes. The portion of mint and lime were ok and somehow over tangy in flavour.

It costs us around 1300INR inclusive of all taxes. Overall a good dining experiences.

KFC !!! IT IS ACTUALLY FINGER LICKING GOOD .. even though the name says chicken .. but the options for vegetarians also amazing... the paneer zinger burger is amazing.. The OMG egg burger was great but unhappy that it has been taken off the menu .. I really hope it finds a place back into the menu ..

All time favorite...bcz we all know when its Chicken its KFC.
Though all the dishes taste more or else same but still smoky grilled chicken, hots wings, nasvilles are always most suitable one for my taste buds.

Snacks---??Chicken---?? = KFC (y)

Being a chicken aficionado, ¬†I am quite frequent at KFCs around the city.After watching KFC's latest commercial, I was pretty excited about their newest food trend-Nashville Chicken Burger.
I took a Zinger Burger and a Nashville. But, I must say, the Nashville one made me pretty disappointed.It is nothing compared to the hype that they made of it. Zinger and Nashville burgers taste similar to me.The only difference was that in the Nashville burger, I got a piece of cucumber.
The Nashville burger was good,as per KFC standard,but nothing extraordinary.
One food item,without which my KFC visits seem incomplete, is Chicken Popcorn.This, my friend, is so "finger lickin' good." :)

Nothing much to say about KFC because they maintain a distinct quality of their food, which doesn't degrade. Only special thing to say that, this outlet is very spacious to accommodate big groups and also separate lobby for birthday parties and friendly bashes. Not to miss the staffs with good behaviour. Enjoy yourself.

This outlet is spacious spread on two floors. Had a sumptuous meal - hot and crispy chicken, chicken zinger burger, nice dips and Alphonso burst krusher. Food was as usual good and at per to KFC standards. Service was fast and the staff was polite.

This is the place you go to if you are a chicken maniac. KFC has been pretty consistent with its quality of food since it opened its door in Kolkata a decade ago. Service falters at times of rush. There is almost always a long queue at KFC and you just have to be patient to taste the deep fried goodness. The Zinger burger was my favorite burger in town. The newly launched Nashville Burger is just a spicer cousin of the Zinger. 
After spending 3 years in the US, where there is no Zinger Burger, it was the one thing I craved for on entering a Kolkata KFC. 
The quality of the burger bun has deteriorated over the years while the price has doubled in the last 3 years. However, their signature fried chicken remains a favorite.

Although this place has made its niche for quite sometime now i believe its gradually losing its charm owing to the competition of the other local and multinational food outlets opening up in the city. Never been a huge fan of their burgers but their fried chicken are definitely impressive. But over the last few days i have felt the chicken has stopped being soft and tender in the middle and the crunchy skin is the only thing you can relish. However, the rice bowls and Zinger meal box provide good options if you are looking for a quick lunch or if you are on the go. I will rate it average.

Everyone knows it and everyone know everything about it. 

Whether you love it or you hate it but you surely can't hate it. 

The new range of chicken nashville is not nice. I don't like it. 

Chicken hot wings and popcorn is my pick. 
Choco lash is nice too.

This particular outlet of KFC in Kolkata is tucked away among the hustle and bustle of the ever busy Park Street .

I grabbed my every time  favourite Chicken Snacker which has now graduated to a longer and leaner Chicken longer as they call it nowadays. To go with it two pieces of original recipe. It was unusually soft and succulent and even larger maybe owing to the unquenchable appetite of the bongs.

No wonder Kolkata is one of my favourite food destinations .

One of the best place to hangout.The cheezy crunch,Boneless strips,Hot wings are delisious.The bowls are good - with popcorn chicken,smoky grilled as well as the burgers.The friends bucket are also available and in resonable price.The 5 in 1 meal box are mouth watering.Chicken dishes are delisious and my most favourite.I'm in love with the krushers such as- choco Lash,Chocopeanut Bolt and many more.The La Carte are good also.I want to visit there again.

I had a bad experience of KFC at Avani Riverside Mall so I never wanted to visit KFC again... But my friends insisted me to visit the Park Street KFC with them so I  unwillingly I had to go there... It was to my surprise i found things taste much better here.. fresh and tasty. The Zinger meal is quite a good one to fill your hunger and within a very low budget as well. Crispy coated chicken fries, chicken pop corns and krushers all tastes much better then the Avani joint.

Kfc is a place where chicken lover's stomach and soul gets satisfied properly. Few days back I went to this place and saw a new item in the menu - chizza (chicken+cheese+pizza) so i thought to try it out .. and trust me it was just awesome; best item in the whole menu I guess just loved it from the 1st bite till the end. perfect from every corner .. flavors were so great ; way better than the those huge burgers. Well burgers also good. ¬†A nice place for hangouts with your buddies. Ambiance is really good. Always love to visit.

Amazing bucket.

Got a decent deal i.e. In ‚Çπ599+taxes i got a bucket with 10 crispy chicken pieces, 2 Pepsi, 2small fries, 1 chicken popcorn.

But the place was quite hot. The A/Cs where off may be so that felt a lil uncomfortable.

Rest the food makes up all that stuff.

So overall good feeling.

Yesterday i went to the kfc outlet in the south city mall. As we all know kfc is one of the most favoured outlet for chicken lovers. Nashville chicken is the new addition to their menu. 
Me and my friend order two nashville burgers and one nashvile fry boneless. The burgers are more like zinger burgers .... but the chicken in it was little bit spicy .... but nothing very special. And the nashvile chicken fry bonelss comes with two burger bread .... the sizes are like kfc chicken strips. Both the chicken in the burger and in the fry are same. Overall i can say we can give it a try.

Guys Park Street, a place where the city of joy Kolkata comes to life. The restaurant is locate at the heart of Kolkata. It is in an amazing location with easy access. Close to park street metro station and bus stop. The food lounge is amazing.
KFC has always been my favorite ranging from veg dishes like cheese crunch burgers to bin veg dishes like chicken popcorn. The crushers are amazing. My favourite one is the virgin mojito and I can have as many as I want it is that much tasty. The service if the staffs is also very good. They are very prompt in preparing the order and the bills. The price is a bit higher due to the service tax and other charges, but yet you can walk into this restaurant once in a while and enjoy tasty food stuffs.

Kfc the name needs no introduction!! This fastfood joint made it to kolkata in the year 2005 and i still remember how we use to stand in a que to get in the restaurant due to its hype.
Time passed by and so many competitors entered the market yet this brand has maintained its quality and still goes on to do great business in the city of joy. 
The recent favourite in the restaurant is the 5 in 1 meal which really is great deal for anyone with a tight budget.
The food on offer is not so healthy as its junk but is definitely a treat to the taste buds.
Order time doesnot take long as its a self service joint. A lead time of 6- 8 minutes and the food is ready
Zinger burger , hot & crispy chicken and chicken boneless strips are some real amazing items to order here.
Desserts are fabulous too.

This is the worst KFC outlet in Kolkata according to my opinion. Whenever something new is released by KFC i usually try out from this outlet and I am as usual dissappointed everytime. The Flame Grilled chicken was cold and stiff when i first ordered it. It was nothing like advertised and my friend who came here from Bangalore said that they have beeter KFC there. Even the new Nashville Chicken was not upto the mark. Usually Nashville Chicken has a sauce which has to be coated evenly throughout the chicken  but it was just given and that too it a very small amount and it has dried up to be a disgusting experience.

Very unprofessional and casual staff at the counters. Asked them to change the drink and they said "nai ho paye ga". Then asked them to bill a chocolate crusher separately they said "nai ho paye ga" 
KFC in India is really shabby compared to other countries.

This is the worst outlet of KFC I've ever visited. The staffs are so rude and the problem with KFC is quality of food, that is not at all up to the mark considering the price, that increases every month.

Tried the red velevet the newest addition to the the kfc crushers family , it may look tempting at first sight durle to the brownish red color of the krushers but it tasted more like chocolate shake wid crumbled ice so with every sip i could feel crumbled ice , that was a downside ,. other than that it was good

Kfc the name needs no introduction!! This fastfood joint made it to kolkata in the year 2005 and i still remember how we use to stand in a que to get in the restaurant due to its hype.
Time passed by and so many competitors entered the market yet this brand has maintained its quality and still goes on to do great business in the city of joy. 
The recent favourite in the restaurant is the 5 in 1 meal which really is great deal for anyone with a tight budget.
The food on offer is not so healthy as its junk but is definitely a treat to the taste buds.
Order time doesnot take long as its a self service joint. A lead time of 6- 8 minutes and the food is ready
Zinger burger , hot & crispy chicken and chicken boneless strips are some real amazing items to order here.
Desserts are fabulous too.

This is the worst KFC outlet in Kolkata according to my opinion. Whenever something new is released by KFC i usually try out from this outlet and I am as usual dissappointed everytime. The Flame Grilled chicken was cold and stiff when i first ordered it. It was nothing like advertised and my friend who came here from Bangalore said that they have beeter KFC there. Even the new Nashville Chicken was not upto the mark. Usually Nashville Chicken has a sauce which has to be coated evenly throughout the chicken  but it was just given and that too it a very small amount and it has dried up to be a disgusting experience.

If its chicken its KFC

THE only issue at kfc is these guys are raising prices each day but the quality and quantity is not improving. 

So as value for money kfc is looking not so convincing like it did a couple of years ago. 

Seating arena in this outlet is very normal.

This one is the first outlet of KFC in Kolkata which is located opposite peter cat. there's not much to say about¬†this place. ambiance is very average but who went to kfc seeking for a good ambiance .¬†if you are hungry grab a zinger burger or if you want to excite your taste buds then there are plenty of other options . they serve you fresh and good quality food and it's a pocket friendly place. A great place to hang out with friends.

KFC park street is one of the oldest outlets in the city under the brand. This has not led it to be the most consistent though. Half the time the required dishes are unavailable. And also the taste fluctuates at times. Being a vegetarian, the options available for people like me is limited, but enough to fill. Apart from taste inconsistency, the other problem is that it's  quality is not that good as compared to other places as well. People who go in for burgers or Krushers can find better options elsewhere.

My favourite kfc outlet since school. 
As a loreto kid, we used to come here, order something and take our ancestor's time to finish the homework, apparently. 
The good old kfc is always a saviour. Zinger, popcorn chicken, rock box they're all a favourite.
Recently I had tried out the chizza. And honestly it failed to impress me that much though.
Nevertheless, kfc holds onto the name and there's not much we can argue on.

I had my first KFC experience from here back in 2008 or 2009. I remember, the 5 of us ordered a Chicken Snacker each which came in like ‚Çπ25 back then. Even the chicken piece inside would be a big one instead of just a small strip which they give now. Higher price with lower quantity!
But the staffs have always been warm here. And the food is good too.

The popcorn chicken, hot wings and Chocolate Krusher are my favorite dishes.

The seating area is quite large... and the service is also very prompt...

We had the chizza over there.. which was very juicy.. The chicken crust was just heavenly.. and the best of all is the mingles bucket... which is very worthy of the price you pay.. 
This was accompanied by my favourite cold coffee... :-)

This outlet is easy to locate as it is on park street. Food is nice. Serving is decent. They don't take much time. Staff is helpful. Everything is decent. But as I go there alot, I've noticed the drawbacks.
Sometimes, the AC doesn't work or something that it stops cooling. It's happened twice that we had to talk to the staff.
Also, that we need another helping hand at the counter where we order our shakes from. One guy is not enough as it takes time for him alone to make it. And making customers wait long isn't nice.
Moreover, it will be advisable for the staff at the drinks counter to wear gloves. As we saw him preparing our krushers without gloves which is a little unhygienic. 

Otherwise, it's a great place we all crave for.

Moreover, it will be advisable for the staff at the drinks counter to wear gloves. As we saw him preparing our krushers without gloves which is a little unhygienic. 

Otherwise, it's a great place we all crave for.

Located opposite to the great Peter Cat Restaurant is this outlet. The outlet is pretty large and serves the juicy chicken fries. Like each outlet the food is same quality-wise, but the attitude of the people on the counter is seriously flawed. Anyway rating is purely based on food.

KFC, Park Street is located on the opposite lane of The Park Hotel. Even with all the posh, sparkly places opening up in this location, KFC is KFC and just because it's a fast food joint it doesn't have customers, thinking this would be foolish.

With the big hall this KFC has, crowd normally don't need to fight for their seats. Food here is like any of their joints- great. A four goes out to KFC!

Location: Just opposite to Peter Cat, Park street.

This is rather a huge outlet of Kfc and as always, the staff is very well mannered.

I saw this new thing on the menu called "Chicken Longer" and decided to try it.

So we ordered 3 chicken longer and 3 virgin mojitos.

Well, chicken longer is basically a little bigger version of a snacker bur is completely a new item in terms of flavour. In this, the Taste of mustard dominates. I didn't find it overtly fancy or something to write home about. It was okayish. And btw, it is not as long as it appears in the pictures .

But what I really liked was the virgin mojito. It was so refreshing as always.

Visited this outlet of KFC for the first time after all this time on a rainy night this August. This visit will always gonna be memorable as I literally fought my way through thunderstorms and heavy shower to reach this place. The place was almost empty i.e. a couple of other people apart from us. This outlet is quite big and spacious. Well, we had ordered a Zinger Burger Meal and Chizza. As for food, well KFC is almost unbeatable when it comes to Chicken. As it goes without saying, I'd enjoyed my meal a bunch, specially it being Zinger Burger, which is my most favourite item over here apart from Hot Wings and Chicken Popcorns. But, unfortunately by the time I started with the fries, they were all cold and soggy :( (well, my fault, as I'd almost forgotten them...no offense meant to KFC :) ) 
So bottomline is..... when it's KFC, it's straighaway a 5 from me!! :)

It was this one cloudy morning, when I decided to wait for my mates by enjoying the company of a good book, my thoughts, and some delightfully succulent pieces of the notorious Fiery Grilled Chicken.
I believe all people on a diet, yet wanting some cheat, would have gorged on this delicacy at some point.

Also love their Zinger Burgers to the core!

Just a small downer for this particular joint, their service can sometimes be a blunder.

This is the first KFC I ever visited and I simply love this outlet as they maintain their quality. I have come here many times and never have I had a bad plate of their crispy,juicy chicken. Have had the zing kong box, chicken rice bowl,chicken popcorn,chicken zinger burger,chicken hot wings,chicken bucket. Lip smacking awesome chicken is what you get here. I love the Choco lash and Blue Vanilla Krushers here. The place is spread over two floors with enough space for a lot of footfall. And yet I have always seen it clean. Thumbs up to this branch of KFC!

KFC the fast food chain has become a global hit but i feel that recently all the success has gone to their heads. After eating the trademark hot and crispy fried chicken i was extremely disappointed. Yes it was hot(temperature wise) and extremely crispy but It tasted waaaaaaay to bland to be the same old kfc which i had fell in love with. Since when did kfc stop using spices? What happened to their secret blend of 56 something secret spices? 

The saving grace of kfc now would have been the fiery grilled chicken which although takes a long time to make/prepare tastes 10,000 times better than the fried hot and crispy chicken, has unfortunately been discontinued.
Perhaps the only good thing left for me to eat there would be the chicken popcorn which i can have at home thanks to venkys and a little paprika.
For burgers id rather go to McDonalds.

Only gave 2 star review because the chicken popcorn and the cookie crusher were good.

I jyst go in for the Zinger burger, which I find is the only decent consumable product of the chain.

This particular outlet is quite large though in terms of seating capacity hence creating a less congested environment and a better ambience.

The food is well pretty much the same as other Kfc outlets.
But this place can be utilized to hang out with friends simply because it attracts comparatively smaller crowds than the other Kfc outlets.

Fried Chicken eh? Now who doesn't like that? That deep fried crispy delicious outer coating with tender and juicy chicken inside. Even thinking about it makes me drool. 
Lots and lots of KFC outlets are there now in Calcutta, this one is located in Park street just opposite Peter Cat. 
All the outlets follow the same recipe, so there should hardly be any difference right? Wrong! Sometimes, they don't have the fresh ingredients and it makes a lot of difference in the taste. Plus, service is another thing, but then again in a self service restaurant what can you expect. 
Been to this outlet a couple of times. Personal favorite being the Zinger and Hot and Crispy Fried Chicken. 
Drop in if you want some crispy fried chicken.

KFC opened door in park street long long ago and I have been frequenting it for a long time.... years ago it was succulent and yummilicious, the zinger burger with sesame seeds sprinkled buns with a massive patty of fried chicken with lettuce and generous amount of mayonnaise.... but alas those days are behind us... though the variety of food offered on the menu is substantially more... but the quality has dropped.... no longer mayo comes with the zinger you have to ask and pay extra for it! The fried chicken though crispy and delicious are sometimes dry.... I wish KFC goes back to its former glory.... I do miss those days.... the only thing that is flawless is the virgin mojitos.... yummilicious!!!

The Alphonso Burst was simply wonderful, and the Chizza i consider to be a 3 out of 5.. because KFC trying to sell pizza by naming it chizza is a bit weird. But then again, its KFC. The location is simply wonderful - just opposite to Peter Cat. All in all, it was a satisfactory experience. Thank you for your service.

Most probably the first outlet in Kolkata if I am not wrong n the biggest of them all till date. This place also has a mezzanine level and located just opposite times furnishings. McDonald's has taken away most of the sales but still this place is worth trying. Service is pretty ok but a small party place would have added some more points to this outlet.

Kfc has pretty much lost it's charm.
I use to run to Kfc all the time for the zinger burger as it used to be yummilicious.
Been to Kfc parkstreet last sunday to re live that finger licking good moment but I disappointed :(
Got a 5 in 1 zinger box.
First of all....the food joint was not that crowded as it was raining cats and dogs.
Yet the waiting time was very long.
The burger bread used to be super soft but it wasn't.
The chicken wings were not that hot.
Fries are definitely better than the hashbrown.
The tables were dirty but the cleaning staff was good as in no time he cleared the table for me.
I really hope they do something about the zinger burger :(

A really sad story of ignorance from the staff. Park Street KFC outlet is one of the biggest and with the best staff in the city. Yet we ordered two chicken rock box and they didn't give us fries. For both the boxes. Since we were in a hurry and talking we forgot to notice but realised it later. If they were out of stock at 12:30 in the morning that's just sad. And even then if it was that it wasn't deducted off our bill. Will avoid KFC forever. The McDonald's just 200 meters away is much better and costs significantly less with better burgers and soft serves.

Have been to several outlets of KFC, and had similar experiences. However the experience in this outlet was different in a not so good way.

This outlet of KFC is clean and the staffs don't push you to place your order soon, which is a good part. Now coming to the main part. I came here two times, within a gap of about one week, and none of the time crushers were available. Both the time they gave the reason of some machine being out of order. I wonder how long does it take to replace a machine!

Coming to the food. On my last visit I ordered chizza. When the box arrived, it was very, very different from what I get in the other outlets. Roughly cut uneven pieces of crispy chicken and the amount of cheese was so less that you won't notice it unless somebody tells you there is cheese. The nightmare worsened up with the first bite. The chicken was dry, overcook and fibrous.

Being situated in the prime location, if this outlet fails to meet the standards, it is such a shame.

Nothing new to write about KFC. This particular outlet is pretty large and spacious. Still, getting a table on weekends might be a pain.¬†

Try their chicken snacker if you are on a low budget but need something filling.
For shared treats, try their bucket options. You'll love them.

I am a huge fan of their crushers. I had visited park street KFC once or twice only, but am a frequent muncher of the oher outlets. I love their chicken popcorn and burgers.

Simply fantastic as always. 
The new 5 in 1 meal is worth the price and filling. 
Must deliver smoothies also to all destinations.
KFC is the ideal place for dine in or take away for one and all!!!

This is actually a KFC "restaurant" with two floors of seating space. The layout and decor is really good, and the food is up to the mark, as you would expect at a KFC. The only thing I'll complain about here is the time they take to serve you. Almost every time I went here, I had been kept waiting for over 10-15 minutes for my order - which, you know, seems like eternity when you're hungry. Other than the waiting bit, this is a great place to eat.

I've visited here during my monthly shopping week. The zinger box is worthy of the money. The chizza has been my favourite! The crispy chicken with the cheese topping with fresh veggies. It tastes the best with the chilli flakes. The perfect blend of spices and cheese makes it really finger licking good!

Any time is kfc time. Though I am not fond of them. As they detoriated their quality. I visited them when I went for some official work as well as when I went to roam around there. One suggestion please try to give drinking water for free.

This one located opposite to Peter Cat is a hard one to enter on 25th Dec, 31st Dec/1st Jan. Otherwise it remains pretty uncrowded. Place is commodious. Food of KFC needs no special mention.
What attracted me the most was their quality of service - the staff made us feel nice.

Kfc is the one of the 2 places(another one is arsalan) for which I didn't give up chicken..I eat only chicken(no other meat).I like this place mostly.because when I came to kolkata for my study in 2005, 2 of my friends took me there for their birthday celebration. I didn't go to such a restaurant before that. after that time I went there so many times and always it makes me nostalgic. Spacious and is very well decorated..I've no words to express the hot and crispy chicken,chicken ginger burger. Here we took zing kong box which contain 1ginger burger,1hot&crispy chicken, french fries,pepsi & chocolate.  ≈Å√òVƒò √ù√î≈≤ ƒ∂Fƒå....

This place has really been a let down. at one point of time this was The KFC and now its like really shabby.
the quality of the food is way inferior than the other KFC outlets and the interior is also just about norrmally kept, not one notch above normal.
its a sad place to eat at anymore. The french fries particularly tasted horrible and of course the chicken too... if the chicken is not worth it then whats d whole point of still having an outlet there.

This KFC is bang opposite the legendary Peter Cat. The best thing for me at KFC is neither the burger nor the fried chicken, but the Vanilla blue and the brownie with the soft serve and hot chocolate sauce. Although I heard they have stopped serving their own ice creams and giving cream bell's instead, if that is the case then they should change that. The Wednesday bucket offers and the 5 in 1 meal right now is selling like hot cakes.

Of the 2 counters open Debanjan who's counter I was at kept going away and coming back with a bunch of keys. It took a long time to place the order. The orders were not being filled in any logical /sequential order. People kept crowding at the counter and I moved to a side. It took over 10 minutes of reminders before anyone attended to my order, then went away after putting half of it together. Again I had to keep cajoling them to attend to the order and complete it. In this period 5 more orders were taken at the same counter. I was given a soft drink that had been standing for this entire period and was devoid of any fizz. This was changed on request
AC on the mezzanine floor was not effective. Tables were not being cleaned. Someone dropped a soft drink on the floor in front of the ground floor counter which was not cleaned for over 10 minutes.
This is not the service level at other KFCs across the city. I have visiting this one from the month it was  and it used to be a great place earlier. I didn't visit the washroom scared that if this is the situation outside, what would it be inside.

It is probably one of the best KFC outlets in the city, and also located at a prime spot right opposite to Peter Cat. Although the service has slightly degraded of late, the service is still quite good.

Went there to try the new cheesa....along with it, I had ordered for the fierry grilled chicken as well. People know about variois items of kfc so much explanatioms about them is not required I believe. But for those who love cheese and haven't got a chance to try this cheesa, I would recommend to go for it. The cheesa is nothing but the regular chicken strips covered with a layer of cheese, onion and capsicum. They also serve an additional cheese dip and salsa dip with it which definitely add an extra lipsmacking factor in it. Price of one cheesa is 159+tax and the amount served is perfect for one person to have a standard snacks.

One of the biggest KFC outlet in the city and a very popular one indeed.

**Location**
Located at park Street just opposite to the famous Peter Cat.

**Experience**
Nothing much to say about KFC food as we all know about it. I have been to this outlet quite some time and it's huge.
It is one of finest among their branches. Recently the place has deteriorated from its level but still a lot better than other ones that's for sure. Management should take care of the managing capabilities of the staffs working there as I found them to be a little disorganized. But yes they gave a very warm hospitality and very well behaved I must say.

Going to KFC is always fun. The food is tasty, though a tad bit overpriced. Yet this having been said, I do appreciate the fact that whether your budget is 100 or 1000 you are bound to find something on the menu.

This outlet of KFC is probably the most spacious in Kolkata, however, this review is not about the usual offerings of KFC, but for the new entrant CHIZZA or shall I say CheatZZA?

Four boneless strips of Chicken smothered with cheese - and claims to be a fusion between chicken and pizza - too far-fetched and is an prime example of glossy pompous advertisements fooling consumers... I would rather have the boneless chicken strips at a lower price ...

Completely disappointing and not expected from KFC!¬†

I love the Italian seasoning though...

The chicken rice bowl is quite good,too. Virgin Mojito is the coolest and refreshing drink , ever. Ambience is okay, staff is co-operative. Btw! I strongly appreciate and respect the guys working there, who communicate in sign language. Keep up the good work. :)

One of the first outlets of the international brand of fried chicken in Kolkata, the Park Street KFC is roomy enough to sit with a bunch of friends, as you kick your diet in its butt. There's nothing to say about its food or the price, of course. Considering the ambience, quality of food, and everything else you get at a KFC outlet, the price is probably appropriate. Even for youngsters who are on a budget, there are some affordable additions to the menu. What I particularly love about the branch is how it employs disabled boys and girls,like some of the other outlets. It always warms my heart to see the level of efficiency with which people accomplish their jobs here, as the hearing-impaired and mute servers work like they have no disability at all, and how they receive the cooperation of their able-bodied co-workers. And, don't expect them to be slow or anything - there won't be any kind of delay because of them! It's an amazing place to feel warmth in the stomach and the hearts, as you create fun memories with close ones.

One of my favorite places to hang out with friends is KFC at Park Street as its in my vicinity. I prefer this place over the other KFC branches due to location for which it attracts footfalls from young lot as they prefer more binge eating and splurging on more fancy fast foods like these. Crispy and crunchy Fiery Chicken and Chicken hot wings are my all time favorite menus while having some adda with friends and colleagues.

Located bang opposite to Peter Cat, this is one of the most spacious KFC's in this city. The outlet is huge and has sufficient sitting spaces, hence finding a seat for yourself even in the busiest days of the year, shouldn't be much of a problem.

The offerings here are pretty much the same as elsewhere. Have tried Zinger Burger and Fries here which was decent. The Krushers were good as well. The people on the other side of the counter, are mostly courteous and tries to be prompt in their service.

However, I have always found service to be one of the biggest disadvantage here, other than their obviously not-so-good Chizza! Overall a decent place in Park Street to come and hang out with your buddies if you do not find a seat in one of the popular restaurants. :-)

KFC is 1 of those food joints which I explored all alone keeping my then little pocket monies saved, hence, this joint holds a special place in my heart. The things I love about KFC are the White-Red theme colour, bright and intelligent staffs, interesting crowd and last but the most importantly the FOOD!! They offer varieties of items but I give a thumbs down to the desserts and drinks, I find KFC extremely generous but then no offence to anyone what's the point of coming to KFC when you are trying French Fries and Potato Burger ! be a rebel, life is all about overcoming your fears, make "The Kentucky Fried Chicken" a success :P KFC you rock I loved the Chizza and I still love the signature KFC Chicken wings and leg piece. You'll never grow old!! :)

I whad never had chizza and always wanted to. So my friend and I went to enjoy this new creative idea of KFC. We had a krusher and a chizza. Chizza is a good idea; but isn't like a pizza at all. It's a weird hybrid; but doesn't taste bad. They've just taken a fried chicken piece; added cheese; chilly; and bell peppers.

KFC doesn't needs a review. Needless to say the food is amazing the ambience is always crowded because of their goodwill which led to creation of such kind of hype.
Always a delightful time.

Today,I am going to give review on "Kentucky Fried Chicken"-a low budget,good outlet for chicken lovers.I can't exactly remember how many times I have visited KFC,it may be with my friends,parents,relatives etc.My general view on KFC:it is good for chicken lovers,it also provides a range of crushers,ice creams,brownie sundae,rice bowlz, pepsi, varieties of chicken preparations......and all are yummy.
Basically,I tasted most of their items and liked them.
Staffs & environment are quite good.
Thank you..

The restaurant is situated in middleton row. KFC is famous for its chicken items but it also serves some very good veg items like paneer zinger, veg strips.
KFC provides standardized food in all of its outlet so not much to say about the food its like any other KFC restaurants in India. The service is fast and good.

This particular outlet of KFC, located on Park Street at the corner turning into Middleton Row and opposite the restaurant Petercat, is a very spacious one with no problems of seating. They even have a small mezzanine, which is generally closed but they open that up if seating is otherwise full in the main floor. Mostly the mezzanine is booked for private parties. There has been a change in the layout ,with the drinks and ice cream section separated from the order area. The service is quite slow and those taking the orders take a long time thus making others' wait longer. With regard to the food,its the same KFC food,good if one like this kind of fast food. I like their burgers and the Mojito is a favourite of mine.

I was of expectations that this one situated in such a posh area of Kolkata will live up to its expectations. However, I was heavily disappointed with the services and preparations, that too during Christmas. The Chizza served was cold n hard. Virgin Mojito was the only saving grace. Hoping for better luck next time.

This particular KFC outlet has two major advantages: firstly it is located in park street and the seating area here is quite spacious. The staffs are cordial and are very prompt in taking orders and serving the food as fast as they can. Sometimes they take a bit long for serving fiery grilled chicken. My favourites are fiery grilled chicken, chicken popcorns, omg burger and vanilla blue. I never had any issues with these. Overall a nice cozy place to hangout with friends or family.

My favorite KFC outlet.
Its bigger than the Esplanade outlet; making it easier to sit at your own tables. Instead of sharing tables with total strangers :/

Owing to the location; the place is always quite full.

Serivice is good. Not as good and prompt as their other outlets!

Just a light snack.. Crispy wings we had. The bad thing about this place was that when i had ordered they also added an unwanted mayo dip with it. I told them that i didn't say anything about a dip! And they said " sir, you said non spicy wings that is why , the dip." On display, it was written 99*(plus tax which amounts to 120/-) but they tried out this cheap trick to force us in buying the dip. Ending up in giving 138.Not for the money of course, the management should announce on the board that dip compulsory extra 15*/- shame on the management for this lame trick. And what for me infuriated was the reaction of the girl who took our order. She was like "gram theke esche naki?".

Kentucky Fried Chicken has made a name of itself in The City of Joy. This outlet is located in Park Street bang opposite to Peter Cat and Au bon pain. I have visited this outlet quite a few times. This is a very spacious outlet with two floors. The staffs are very well behaved and courteous in nature. I have had many items of this outlet namely fried chicken, chizza, zinger burger, rice bowl etc. I am in love with their chizza. I actually had it on the very day of its release. It is delicious. The fried chicken is another favorite of mine. The Krushers are also delicious. I will surely visit again.

I have been to this place earlier also. But this time only one word can do justice to my experience and that's horrible. 

We reached there at around 5 in evening which is very much business time for them. 

But, we found that they don't have quiet a few things and some which was there they were not willing to give such as Chicken Snackers. When the person took order for snacker, the other one started scolding him bcz they only had 10 left. 

Food was cold and seemed stale. We had chicken rockbox, two piece firey grilled chicken and snacker. French fries were not crispy, Chicken Zinger Burger had no veggies. 

Hygiene issue. I found small insects and flies inside store. This is something which I never expected from KFC.

Store manager did ask us how's the food and I am sure he would have regretted later as we depicted the facts to him. He did offer to refill with everything but we refused politely because refilling wouldn't have changed anything.

This KFC outlet is close to Loreto College. Been there a couple of times. KFC is a place for chicken lovers basically so it doesn't leave me with much options. However, I like the potato crispers, the virgin mojito, the vegetable strips with gooey cheesy stuffings inside . The quantity does not commensurate with the high prices I feel. Nevertheless, the preparation and taste of every item is nice and worth trying.

Spacious place, yummy chicken, nice music and staring waiters, Standard KFC experience. Right across the road from the crowded Peter Cat. It's a paradise for every KFC fanboy.

This is a repeated bad experience at KFC we had.

The staff is rude, the tables are not clean.

The disappointment cannot be expressed with words.

There has never been any steps taken by the concerned authorities.

Opposite Peter cat, at park street,  one of the specious kfc outlet. Ordered crispy chicken with alphonso burst. A 'hatke' choice for kfc lovers.

Have been there many a time...but ever gonna be their ac working properly? The washroom are worse than a roadside eatery! What would i comment on their food? It should be the same because its KFC! But yes...they should really look into these important matters! AND NEVER EVER VISIT THERE ON CHRISTMAS! Trust me i have visited the place on that day and saw chicken bones scattered here and there!!

The day i visited Peter Cat, we were thirsty so we wanted to sip something chilling! And bam! Here we were! KFC! Just opposite at Peter Cat! I took choco crunchy crushers which is my all time favourite while my foodie friend ordered choco brownie smoothies! Both were equally satisfying! :p We quenched our thirst and then we were off in quest of more grandeur dishes! :) Along with Krushers we also ordered Chicken Popcorn as we also wanted something to munch on!! :D (Bengali's problem :p )
    What i really liked about this place is their huge spacious eating area which most of KFC'S lack! The service was quick and the hosts were friendly too! ;)

my review for this outlet will be very low. been a decade since i had been visiting kfc in various cities across the country. never came across a outlet where there ac doesnt work and you will be sweating. placing order is sloppy.. slow service specially if u go to get krushers or pepsi or virgin mojito be ensured its half filled only with ice and you can easily see the glass.
Now lets come to home delivery: u order and b ¬†assured tht ¬†you will ¬†get it delivered in 3 hrs one day someday 1 n half hours inspite u tell them on phone tht you will pay by cash and ask them to get exact change the delivery boy will never get it and u will end up paying a round off price.¬†

highly dissappointed especially from this outlet.

I just love KFC . . The food is finger licking good whenever i see kfc i go crazy . . Haha !! The chicken is so tender and juicy that u feel like eating more . Zinger and popcorn chicken r my all time favourite . .¬†But the service here in park street is not at all good they don't give u the bill and when u go to the counter they ask u to repeat ur order and takes alot of time to serve . . The wash room is like Idk when they cleaned it last . . This is the last outlet which i will prefer if i have to go to KFC.

Yes,finally an outlet I can really talk positive about besides the New Market outlet.Dining space is huge.Adequate and well-mannered staff,prompt service and as usual the finger-licking-good food.The plus point is if you get a seat beside the window you can gaze upon the busy Park Street alongside enjoying your meal.

If I have to visit any KFC outlet I would prefer this outlet at the last of my last. This place is located at the opposite side of Peter Cat. Their AC does not work properly, their washrooms are dirty, their staffs don't know how to apply coupon codes, for this they ran to their manager, who never stay present there. Management needs to look after these.

I‚Äôm still puzzled how this brand has thrived and this branch in particular. Yes, it retains the ‚ÄòOriginal Fried Chicken‚Äô recipe by Col. Sanders but their service levels and business plan are plain awful. Being located in an area with high footfalls, generated by shopping crowds and put on steroids by Mac‚Äôs across the street, their methodology of dealing with service times is not something I‚Äôm fond of; Stack up fried chicken ahead of time and dish it out as soon as the order comes in. And service levels at this place reflect panic as compared to the recently shut down branch on Hill road which was quite decent.

Thus, you‚Äôre charging a reasonably high amount when you compare how much meat comes in the average half Tandoori chicken (mind you, they don‚Äôt include the whole breast piece as those portions are used to make up chicken strips and burger fillets) but receiving a hot & fresh piece is a game of roulette. Hence, haven‚Äôt eaten the fried chicken in years now as the pile of prepared pieces greets me as I enter.

The Zinger burger on the other hand is superior to any offering at Macs, mainly because it includes pure meat. If they could expand the offerings to grilled instead of fried items, it would be great. Popcorn chicken was another decent item, more for the flavoring than the quantity of meat.

Crushers are an assault on the taste buds. Can‚Äôt believe they would be served up. Excess ice and savings on real ingredients.

This is one of the few places which I'm never tired of visiting. I don't know whether it's the zinger burger or the chicken bucket, the hot wings or the chicken nuggets, the rice bowl or the Krushers but I love KFC especially this outlet. It is more spacious than others (I find the scm one a bit clumsy).

Park Street Kfc is one of the worst joints i have come across. Whenever you enter there is some kind of problem with the AC which is extremely annoying. While Ordering they will always try to make you confused by saying "You Want It With Extra Cheese , Small , Medium , Olives , Jalape√±o". Food quality has degraded. Ordered Chicken Snacker , Chicken Rock Box , Choco Lash And Alphonso Burst. French Fries were extremely salty only i found Choco Lash to be awesome.

I love Chicken rice bowl, Crispy Chicken, Hot Wings and the most loveable are the Krushers(Virgin Mojito) very refreshing. But gradually I found that dishes have started losing their taste and juciness.Innovative dishes were brought but weren't at all upto the mark. The ambience and service are as excepted very lovely and pleasant. Hope KFC will work out making the kind of food what they are best of so that I can visit too often.

A premium KFC Outlet that you might consider when your pocket is heavy and mood is happy.
The decor and food are good. One can hang out here with friends and/or family comfortably. Try to avoid the place after 9pm as drunken people come over sometimes to spend their extra cash on food here.
Also unless you are a KFC fanatic and/or don't care about price tags, I wouldn't recommend this place to you.
If you happen to come here try to order crispy fried chicken and/or krsuhers as they are the best here. Try to avoid the burger and meals. You can opt for diet coke if you are too thirsty.

For a quick bite, KFC is ideal. And especially when the budget is low and you are hungry. The zinger burger, popcorn and hot and crispy chicken are my favourites. Besides the chicken, I love the french fries. But the food chain must keep a tab on the price. Is is being increased every now and then.

2) Incredibly slow
3) Cleanliness is not at all maintained 
4) The duty manager, a female was super rude and also amazingly shameless
5) Cold, stale fried chicken

Really poor show by Yum! In Kolkata. Now I realise how your delhi NCR outlets are way way better. Stores like these should he shut down. Such a disgrace. Wish I could give a negative rating.

2. They tried to convince us to buy dips,telling that we have to take that,as this is compulsary. When we do not want that, they can not force us to buy it. Anyways we didn't take that.

Located just opposite Peter Cat, this KFC outlet is a great place for hangout with friends. Of course like other KFC outlets, the menu is the same. I'd tried Veg Zinger Burger and Cold Coffee, as usual. Unlike the Jessore Road outlet, the cold coffee was quite good as well as the burger.
Go ahead if you are a KFC regular and looking for a great hangout with family & friends.

They deliver, what they promise. I have never been to KFC joint and said this joint is better than the other one. Never. 
So what is the best part. Consistency. 
You order your food here and you know what to expect. What we expect is delicious food(read chicken), and they give us that. 

This particular is very spacious and they also have a special "birthday celebration" space, which is also used as a "couple privacy/flirting space" when there are no birthdays. The staff is very friendly. Plus the desserts counter is in the middle of the area, which is pretty awesome. 

All in all nice place and KFC's consistent delicious chicken.

Kfc has introduced their new 99rs big boxx meal...
Finally its worth the money!! The meal contain two big pieces of fried chicken, one tikki burger and french fries. With tax it comes at a rate of 115 approx. Totally filling. We also has one brownie krushers and one chocopeanut krusher.
Kfc really needed this pocket friendly meal to keep its fans comg back to them.
Well done!

This brand just runs by their name. The fries are deep and unhealthy. You will find them good at first, then get bored with all these stuffs. People ponder over it a lot. I just don't like it.

Well the highly overrated restaurants of Park Street have always disappointed the foodie in me except Olypub and Mocambo but this one rocks. The place is huge and we frequently used to crash here with friends. This place is perfect for hangouts and quick and inexpensive lunches with friends. No difference of quality from the other KFC outlets just a more spacious one, and a little overpriced due to it's location.

KFC is one of my favorite food joints and I always prefer KFC when I am out with my friends or family but I am highly dissatisfied with its Park Street outlet. I was there with my husband today evening. First of all the food that we ordered was served cold. The Rocking Chicken Burger was stiff and cold, we had to ask one waiter to change the fries that were given. Although the staff is courteous, but food quality was not good. Then I got a rude shock as I saw a big mole running around the outlet. One of the staff members saw it, he looked for it here and there and simply wandered off as if it's a regular "guest". Nobody bothered to dispose it. I am thoroughly distraught and I am never going to visit this outlet ever again.

KFC - their prices are going up, and portion coming down. The image of the burger is thrice the size of what you actually get. The zinger burger has lost it's zing. I am sorry, but I have to give KFC, not just this outket but every outlet in town, a 2.5

VISIT

I visited this outlet of KFC on 31/5/2015.

AMBIENCE

Coming to the ambience, i would say that the ambience is spectacular due to the location and the well-crafted restaurant.

FOOD

Coming to the food,i would say that i had ordered for a veg strips and a glass of lemon Virgin Mojito.The rice and the chops served in the attractive bowl of veg strips were luscious.They two formed a good couple to have together.The chops were better than the ¬†unhealthy ones we have on the streets of Kolkata.I liked the rice immensely.It tasted like veg biryani.It was perfect in every way be it spices selection and quantity,amount of oil,choice of yellow colour,etc.It should be more in quantity.It can be best had in the form it is given without adding sauces to it.Further,the lemon mojito was quite a refreshening drink.It had lemons,mint leaves,etc.It was too perfect in every way.Further their presentation was also good as to the choice of cups,cover lids,straws,etc.I would recommend everyone to have a try at both of them and i am sure you won't feel dissatisfied with my selection.

SERVICE
The staff is quite well-behaved,helpful and agile.

RATINGS
My ratings are as follows:
Ambience-4/5
Food-4/5
Service-5/5
Value for money-4/5

I paid a visit to this joint on a hot sultry weekday afternoon only to find this joint relatively empty. Given the location, it was a pleasant surprise. I had the Chicken Rock box- a combo meal which comprised of a burger, a piece of fried chicken, fries and soft drink. Well nothing much to comment on the fries and the soft drink- as they are staple products anyways. However as is the norm/trend in quick service restaurants(QSR)¬† I found the burger and the fried chicken to be strictly okayish. Something was lacking on the flavour front. Though cannot pinpoint the exact deficit. Pricing was alright. Service and staff behaviour was prompt and polite.

Went there with my girlfriend. It's quite a good place well organised with a separate drinks bar to collect the drinks from and ample space for seating. We tried the new Moroccan and Mexican zinger burgers and found them to be very tasty at the same time the Virgin Mojito was also very awesome. Loved the place if only the cleaning staff was quicker at their work it would have been a .5 rating more.

Well, its a very typical KFC with 2 floors off sitting place... Been the same ever since it opened up... Fast service... But not very warm or welcoming people at the counter like in other outlets... 
Well there is a krusher or ice cream on the go opening outside the kfc so you don't really need to get in for that...
Pretty clean...

Have been a regular at the kfc outlets for years now. But this outing i finally tried the chicken rice bowl which has been on the agenda for quite a while. Turned out to be a variant of our Indian Biryani topped with chicken popcorn. I liked the taste but found it very oily. Also tried the alphonso crusher (seasonal) which was very tasty too. About the outlet the staff was very slow and inefficient. The park street outlet is big yet we could not find a table coz all of them were littered and no one from the staff was bothered about it. On asking for cleaning one of them came after 5-7 mins and just removed the tray and did not even wipe the table. Very very sloppy service from KFC.

KFC; Chicken Snacker, lime grass chicken wings, Mojito and I can go on... I really like them in any outlet.
As known to all that KFC's staffs are one of the sweetest people in this business, but there comes a time where things get into their head. Likewise, staffs or attendants at the billing counter are brash and rude, full of expressions and impatient. 
There is not a single doubt that we all love KFC but the outlet's business can badly get affected coz of their behavior. 

Hope to see the change here!!!

Thank You

Spicy chicken bucket
The rice bowls aren't that good so you can omit them. In the end do have the brownie and ice cream.

My favourite fast food zone, at Park street. Been here like, a zillion times. Very courteous staff, and relatively more spacious interiors make the Park street branch of KFC,much better than its other branches. This branch of KFC made me so addicted, that till a few days back, KFC was almost my staple diet :P A must, to satiate my impulsive hunger pangs, when I am out for some work, or for shopping, or hanging out with friends. Not the healthiest option, but definitely the tastiest. My all time favourites: the legendary Zinger, Chicken wings, and Choco crusher. I love their desserts as well, though one has to wait for a long time in the queue, during lunch hour, or when it's over-crowded.

Located opposite peter cat this place is just awesome for a long hangout and chat session. There is nothing to say about the food here. Its as usually good like they serve in all kfcs. I tried the masala chicken wings for a change along with their signature crispy chicken. Both were good. But the masala chicken wings had too much masala to numb your taste buds after a while. The virgin mohito was good but the vanilla blue is better. The iced capuccino is heavenly and yummm!!!

A bucket of yumm fries, some chicken popcorn, a crusher and a corner seat - my ultimate saviour during times when I'm unable to procure seats at my other favourite places in Park Street and left hungry on the streets! The place is happy, roomy, comfy and open till real late :-) so I can also comfortably finish my drinking and dancing with friends and can still manage some grubs before heading home!

Though i am not much of a fan of burgers and fries, but ended up visiting this restaurant numerous times with my buddies.I  always opt for the chicken bucket as the chicken is really crispy and fresh and we were served really good pieces.We also ordered french fries to compliment it which was hot and quite tasty.I love the choco crusher ,one with the chocolate nuggests which kind of serves both as a cooler and desert.
The ambience is pleasent and this particular joint very well maintained.The service is prompt and the staff very polite.

The service is quick and easy.
The menu changes quite a lot so its difficult to find ur favourite item sometimes (ZING KONG BOX...U R MISSED).
There is a separate section for the beverages ... where u can get ur crushers and pepsi.
The price is a bit on the higher in comparison to the other food joints in kolkata...but i guess...thts wat KFC is for u :)

This outlet of KFC is quite large,with ample seating.The service always quick.The food always great.

However,I have come to notice one thing about KFC-There is a differential price as per the locality.For eg an item in kfc of Quest Mall,Park Street,South City Mall is a little costlier than The Hatibagan outlet.Do check it out.I ,however, do not know of any other outlet which costs a little cheaper.

Located in the heart of the city this outlet is rather disappointing.No doubt the food is good,cause KFC chicken is always a delicious treat.But the ambience is not quite impressive & the AC is barely functional! they do not have the offer items most of the times.Like when there were Wednesday zinger offers most of the times it was unavailable.The first floor is usually closed even if the ground floor is fully occupied! But yet I visit this place again & again as its just next to my college.recommend just for namesake!! After  all its KFC & I have always loved KFC chicken :-).    
 P.S:The new item in the menu "Mexican burger" is awesome

That is no fast food when you are served 7 to 10 minutes later, when there are hardly anybody in the shop ( around 4:30pm).
Sundae w brownie was pathetic and the staff even agreed that it was becos of the faulty machine.
Food at Quest Mall is much better. 
Come on, keep the standard or just close shop.

For a change once wondered how the veg items would taste like....so tried out Potato Crisper & it was equally tasty.

It's really great fun times when we are at KFC, specially at this Park street branch.. we have some great gossips and super time spent over some great chicken bites.... my fav being Paneer zinger meal among veg and crispy fried chickens and chicken twisters among non-veg meals. Really love all they have to offer, there are though several rumours and news in the media about KFC products ... but believe me everytime the food comes in front of me I forget all those gossips... and just have some great time gorging over some wow chicken dishes.. so, please carry on the good job.

The food was not what u expect at KFC... Along with service.. I have been to many KFC all over.. For a critic its not good.. I ordered corn which was clearly out f the fridge and served after warming up a little in the same container its stored nd with no flavour. A road stall makes a better one with less oppolance. The mango burst, since done in a hurry was below the quantity mark for KFC, since i know their mark. I can just go on. O one more thing, KFC doesnt give hot sauce as per the lady at counter(rimpa), which is new to me. Overall the worst ever. Never expected this from KFC.....

One of the most efficient outlets of KFC in kolkata. Food is as usual as compared to other KFC outlets. The service is excellent. They are very fast. Part street will provide you the ambiance you need. The place is quite large.¬†

#RECOMMENDED (This outlet)

Well. I am trying to find the right words. Starters, I got charged for two zingers and got 1 which was a takeaway and I didn't bother to check because I believed this was a part of the job. Thoroughly disappointed was not even close to what I felt. Mistakes occur, and as humans as we are, we can't help but goof one up every now and then. That being said, I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the quality of the zinger. Now, that's a big thing because it used to be the quintessential solution to all my problems. It was sad to see how pitiful the Zinger had become. Without any zing, whatsoever. All in all, more than deprived I feel at a sense of loss and now I know why some uber cool and ultra smart person said, all g(f)ood things must come to an end. Good bye zinger, it was a pleasure knowing you in this lifetime. Oh hey, look...there's a McDonald's across the street. Oh well!!! Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Kfc..and that too in an area of Park Street had to b one off the best,and it definately lived up to its mark.Being 2 storied it had ample space for a large group.As of other outlets,it was well maintained.Although the service was a bit slow,maybe due to less number of waiters it was more or less equal.

Love you Zinger burger. The chicken bucket with different sauces is divine. I like the hot wings and snacker burger too. ¬†The brownie with vanilla ice-cream is my favorite. Unlike the other KFC's this one is huge. Its clean and spacious. i like the colorful balloons they have to offer to kids. Oh and I do love the mini crusher and mojito.

Nothing to write about the name suggests its own goodwill and the quality of the food. The crushers and the chicken wings are only budget friendly otherwise its a bit costly so once in two months you may try out...

Located opposite to Peter Cat is one of the several outlets of KFC. The ambiance of park street certainly adds up some extra points to this outlet.  We were celebrating one of our friend's birthday. We ordered the chicken box meal, and I opted for virgin mojito as my drink. The box meal was tasty and juicy, and the mojito was refreshing. I also tasted the iced cappuccino from one of my friend, and it was also good.

Though it stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken, kfc has become synonymous and has kind of become a holly grail for the chicken lovers of India. This outlet of KFC is located in parkstreet just opposite Peter Cat. This is the one place which has redefined the way of savoring chicken and has helped me discovering the weakness for fried chicken in my tastebud. The day i first tried it and then there was no turning back. It helped to indulge into chicken by avoiding the old and conventional forms i.e. indian and chinese ones. KFC gave a new definition of having and relishing the world's one of the most favorite meat. This is the place which gave my crave for chicken justice during those auspicious days when eating non-veg is forbidden at home. Be it the crispy Zinger burger, hot wings, fiery grilled chicken, hot and crispy etc the names just brings water in my mouth. KFC- the final destination to al my chicken urges.????

got flummoxed really.almost raw meat inside with a smell with a cosmetic"deep fried"coat on the exterior.kfc,is it real?they didnt care enough to see if it is as good to bite as great it is to look good.this was my second visit to the outlet after an year with sister,brother in law and their kids.and my sisters daughter complained after we ordered two big bucketful and got busy biting.she said "uncle,arent we looking as a team of discovery animals gorging on our preys?"the core of the chicken drumsticks really was undercooked.and it created stomach upsets too for the whole day.while the kfc name is too big can customers humbly ask for bit more care in serving it?we indians are used to marinated well spiced meat and kfc didnt meet the standard.so a rather average 3.5 rating for this outlets food.

it has became a staple for me. every now n then i drop in there. but i reduced the frequency lately since i feel that the portions are getting smaller and the prices are ever rising. sometimes the hot and crispy chicken is stiff, tasteless and not so crispy.¬†new hot and saucy chicken was really nice n lip smacking. i mostly order rizo meal when i am too hungry. and the brownie sundae is very delicious also tried almost all the chicken items and loved each one of them except for the chicken twister...... waiting for something new. ..______they have the new Spicy crunch chicken, its an upgraded version of hot n crispy chicken. it tastes fab! costs near to 200rs.

Good ambience. I would rank it just after CC2 KFC. Wonderful service and a good place to hangout. Situated in Park Street, the Mecca for the foodies of kolkata! ;) So one would definitely have a tough time deciding where to go! KFC or somewhere else....

If you love chicken don't even think of anything else..! Just go for it!

This is my favourite KFC as its quite spacious and I always manage to grab a seat here. KFC crispy chicken is an all-time favourite so I won‚Äôt go into it. My recent love is the hot n saucy chicken. It‚Äôs sure heavenly. The sauce tastes great and the chicken is soft. Apart from this, I always order the zinger burger along with the Virgin Mojito. The chicken patty inside is soft and tender. The brownie sundae is a must. Absolutely no complain about the food!! It‚Äôs so good!

I was here on Saptami morning, to avoid usual restaurant rush. We were hungry and in a hurry, and not disappointed. We ordered rice meals with chicken popcorn, chicken wraps, fried chicken, zingers, and a new saucy chicken with strawberry crush...the new last two being new on the menu. The saucy chicken was pretty damn nice! I am coming back for more!
Service was deft and fast. Beverages and Desserts counter is separate in this store which is kind of neat. The store is located in the heart of park street and has ample seating with a good view of the promenade. Worth a visit.

The Kfc outlet is opposite the famous Peter Cat in Park Street. The items are moderately priced and have an enigmatic¬† and refreshing flavor of its own, definitely pleasing to the taste buds. The meals and the refreshing drinks ordered were: New Rock Box Meals, Rice Meals and KFC Krushers. Among the Krushers, the Virgin Mojito and the Iced Cappuccino were too good a combination with that.¬† We also had a small sized chicken popcorn and lastly we took two soft serves.

I was extremely dissapointed with my visit to this particular outlet of KFC last night. I had gone to get a delivery order because they dont pick up the call of the home delivery number, and this has happened to me a number of times.   
It wasn't all that late,just a little after 8 approximatey. I wanted a rice bowl,it wasn't available. They may have introduced 5 variations of it,but they didn't have any of them. I asked for their new entry in the menu,chicken chillyz, and guess what,they didn't have it either. So I asked for Hot wings,they said its going to take minimum 25 minutes. Thereafter,I walked out of KFC without anything to take back home.

Does an international food chain operating in the heart of the city functions like this? I wonder.....

Well a fast food joint is literally comprehended by what it serves and how readily its available ! Surprisingly, they are just opposite of that! I have never seen such a slow service of KFC ever! By far, this was one of the most crowded outlets I have ever been too! And even the cashier guy..was unable to explain me.. Why the zinger burger wasn't available! I finally chose chicken pieces which were drenched with oil! A total failure! The krusher was given to me..after such a long wait..from the other counter ! 
In a nutshell..try different foods..of park street..and if u have to eat at KFC..go somewhere else! This outlet  is not the place to be!

Celebrating my birthday, as I was, the meals and the refreshing drinks ordered were: New Rock Box Meals (formerly Lunch Box Meals), Rice Meals and KFC Krushers. Among the Krushers, the Virgin Mojito and the Iced Kappuccino are light and stress-alleviating.

P.S.: Finding a place here even at 3 pm on weekdays may get, at times, painstaking.

Serves standard KFC items v.i.z. fried chicken. You can get snacks, and box meals and krushers to quench your thrist. The items are value for money. Superb ambiance, pocket friendly and a trendy place to eat out. There is vegetarian option also. The chicken served is halal complaint for benefit of pious muslims.

The KFC in park street is a 10 mints. walk from the park street metro. It is one of the biggest KFC outlets in Calcutta.
I love KFC but this park street division is very slow in serving times. The restaurant is well lit, well spaced, and clean. It is a nice place, if not best in class. The ambiance is pretty good, as i have mentioned earlier. The food is not up to the mark. The quality of food has degraded over time. The values are increasing with the simultaneous decrease in quality, it sad to see one of the best restaurants in this condition. I would like to suggest people that you should check the menu properly before ordering, because not everything, deserves to be eaten by foodies. 
Here i sum it up.
Pros-  1 good ambiance.
           2 well maintained.
           3 good billing system.                                           MUSTS- ZINGER BURGERS, FRIED CHICKENS.
                                                                                                AVOID-WOW RANGE.
Cons- 1 Zero value for money
           2 every thing in menu is not up to the mark
           3 Bad customer support.

this is the biggest KFC in kolkata and really guys... it is big... but still it is in the biggest fooding area of Kolkata and is normally packed to the brim... the good thing about this place is that is normally cleaner than the other places.. but other than that it is Just a KFC.... now in the past couple of months i have visited KFC a number of times but the number is getting smaller and smaller... the quality of food is going down by the day and eating this food always now a days gives me trouble health wise... in general the rizo rice and gravy is very good... and the veg zinger burger that they have started with the extra crisp is good provided you do get a fresh burger form them... if not then it is not crispy... the main problem with these places is that the sale of veg items in Kolkata is so low that they dont keep making them and it is not mnormally fresh... thats why i keep changing the order like add a slice of cheese or ask for extra mayo cause of which they have to give you a fresh burger...

but the quality of the food in KFC has gone down big time and is no more fun to eat...

This is by far the most crowded and noisy KFC in town and chances are you won't get a place even on a weekday at 3. We didn't. 
We ordered a 6 pc chicken bucket crushers and cold coffees.. Taste wise it was the same as other outlets. Nice crispy chicken and smooth crushers. 
But the service here is shoddy. They refuse to provide adequate napkins and ketchup with the food and it is really irritating to ask for them again and again.
Cleanliness is also a problem here. 
Cheers!

The cheapest and the best that park street can offer you. Crispy chicken is authentically great. If you are half hungry, go in for the chicken shots n a sparkling crushers. If u want something heavy the rock box and the chocolate crushers will fill you up till the neck. If you want to go economical .. 3 piece chicken combo for 2 is enough.

The best thing about this outlet is that it is super spacious. Went there few times during the weekends.
Menu is no different here. We ordered the newly introduced rice bowl here for the first time. Quantity was good but i felt like having "sticky rice" which was crunchy from from the inside so the experience was not good with rice. However the evergreen classic crispy chicken needs no introduction. Its unique taste will attract you again and again

I wonder how I haven't reviewed this place yet ! 
Almost everything on the menu is tasted , but I'll be reviewing one specific meal 
Last week Sunday after a pool party my friend and I dropped in , hungry ! Sleepy ! And more hungry ! And this place was a pure saving grace. 
I ordered the 'chicken rockin' meal ' which came along with fries , burger and a medium Pepsi it was around 175/- which was perfectly fine. 
Few must tries apart from the pocket friendly 'chicken rockin' meal ' would be 
The chicken bucket with the 4 dips , of course the zinger burger ( highly recommended ) Oreo crushers , chicken popcorn and oh yes also you can try the lunch meal. Yellow rice with curry and few chicken pieces it's pretty filling and yummy too !

I'm one avid KFC-er across the world. In general, KFC standards in Kolkata are quite poor. But I guess the one in Park Street is the Worst ever I have come across anywhere. Staffs are rude, trying to cheat even on chosen chicken pieces, table layout is unplanned and to top it all, the cooling (the AC I mean) simply doesn't work. I stepped in today afternoon for a munch and had to run here and there just to find a less hot spot to sit. It may look interesting for KFC first timers in the city but overall very very disappointing per normal KFC standards.

I'm one avid KFC-er across the world. In general, KFC standards in Kolkata are quite poor. But I guess the one in Park Street is the Worst ever I have come across anywhere. Staffs are rude, trying to cheat even on chosen chicken pieces, table layout is unplanned and to top it all, the cooling (the AC I mean) simply doesn't work. I stepped in today afternoon for a munch and had to run here and there just to find a less hot spot to sit. It may look interesting for KFC first timers in the city but overall very very disappointing per normal KFC standards.

My college was in Park Street and therefore this particular KFC outlet was just at a stone's throw away. We used to have this one hour long lunch break and in my first year I visited KFC, almost every other day. The people got to know us and even offered us a trip inside their kitchen. Anyway, that's besides the point. I have tried out almost every thing from KFC and among my favourites are the fiery grilled chicken, the Choco-lash crusher, the lemonade and the rice bowl. I think the rice bowl has become the most loved option now. You get rice and small chicken popcorns at just Rupees 103. It is quite filling and makes for a great quick lunch. Also the little chocolate cake packed with molten chocolate inside has the capability to make you feel like you are in heaven. 
The only thing that I do not like about KFC is that their bathrooms are not clean. Also what I love about it, is, that it employs many verbally challenged people for whom jobs are not easily available. I feel that's wonderful.

There are Some days when u just feel like chewing on some calories .. So I headed straight to KFC m ordered chicken popcorn zinger burger , veg strips and Virginia mojito . To top it finished my meal with a nice cream. The veg strips were average. Zinger burger was good chicken could have been more crisp .. Best was chicken popcorn which was fried to perfection .. Overall experience was fine..

I dont know what has happened to KFC park street outlet... in last month i went there 4 times... all on sundays... the place was resembling like a battlefield.... the floors were dirty... it was crowded(coming to that later)... the AC was also not working properly... n these i fpund in all my 4 visits... on 2 occasions they told me that desserts n sundae were not available coz the machine is not functioning ... that too at 7 pm... the place used to b so clean n nicely managed but the floors were dirty n unclean... the toilet area was also wet n dirty n filthy... the place was crowded as ppl were standing in q to place an order n inspite of having 4-5 counters they were using only 2 of them... and after waiting for about 20 mins in the q to place the order they say " sorry sir this is not available,it will take 15 mins" half of their menu items r not available or have to wait for 15-20 mins to get them. I was really very disapppointed with their service...n the way they r managing these days... earlier was was so clean n organised... but their standard has fallen down dramatically... just visit the pizza hut or Mc donalds across the street n v can c the diffrence in the cleaniness n management. I wont comment on the food coz the quality of all the KFCs are the same... but atleast they shud consider abt the ambience n management

Here's a shout out to all the LC girls who knew that if there was no assembly and no club meeting- then we were most definitely the first customers at KFC. All birthday treats , sordid break-ups , late after college work for the fest , arts and craft, drama and other activities made us yearn for a KFC chicken snacker/zinger and drink. Being regulars(by that i mean squatters)- we loved any and everything they served us. However, honest to god this is the best kfc in the city  in terms of service as well as food. I know this as while still at college we hung around to the New Market one as well as the mani - square one - i have too words for them- DRY CHICKEN- for a franchise that has chicken in its acronym- you cannot serve anything less than delectable. My favorite is the  zing-kong box- it has everything-its also  pocket friendly- very filling (and truly finger licking good!!!)

To be honest I am not a big fan of deep fried and greasy food be it chicken or any other form of meat. However, if I ever have an occasional urge to have fried chicken I head over to KFC Park Street. The batter tastes pretty good especially the hot and spicy one. The snacker can be good snack and the zinger is quite filling. We used to frequent this place as a big 'gang' of students when we were in college and used to love having a zinger, a couple of pieces of fried chicken and a virgin mojito and then a softy. And then go home and skip dinner. The decor is like any American fast food chain and as per KFC standards with lots of red and white and Colonel Sanders. The food is self serviced but the tables and surrounding are always neat and clean. Nowadays, we order in more which too is pretty rare as I have become very conscious about keeping fit. Even if I wasn't I would not visit KFC very frequently. But if one likes fried stuff and one likes KFC I am sure one will keep visiting from time to time.

KFC - Kentucky Fried Chicken :P

*Location - Prime location,located at the heart of Park Street.Just at the opposite of Peter Cat.

*Brief - Have spent loads of time in this outelt :)

*Ambience/Decor - A very spacious outelt(probably the most spacious KFC in Kolkata).Lots of tables and also provision to have a seat on the first floor :P

*Things to try - Zinger Burger,with extra cheese tastes just wow and I am drooling while writing about this :D The Rice Bowl with chicken pieces is a must for me :) The Twister with thin bread and chicken fillings in the inside is just marvellous :P
The chicken wings combo,krushers and Kreamball are all worth tasting :)

*Purse Check - KFC with its happy hours is a better place to visit if you are short on money. But otherwise the service tax they charge is worthless,as we ourselves have to carry our food and drop the tray!! Most of the customers dont think this way maybe :P

*Overall - A good place to visit and some cool time with friends and loved ones :)
Recommended !!

This is undoubtedly the best outlet of this brand located right opposite the very famous Peter Cat. KFC certainly needs no introduction,it's a hub for crunchy and juicy fried chicken lovers.
Ambience 9/10
A very neat restaurant with rounded table chairs and huge pictures on the red walls. Separate counter for Sundaes. Seats on the first floor also. Brightly lit,great ambience.
Food Presentation 9/10
Fiery grilled chicken and curry crunch etc come in huge buckets. The chicken popcorns come in those pop corn buckets. The Sundaes are served in ball shaped bowls which look really cool!
Food Quality 9/10
The fiery grilled is really juicy and spicy,you'll definitely love it. The pop corns are the best snack along with some krushers which is refreshing! Even the Sundae is good.
Food Quantity 8/10
The small popcorn bucket serves you little amount. The wings are not filling. Rest of the items come in apt quantity.
Cost effectiveness 8/10
You may find fried chicken buckets a bit pricey especially when you know that mughlai joints would serve more chicken pieces in that price,but yes fried chicken is a different genre altogether and you won't mind spending for those!
Overall 43/50

No complaints about the outlet- it's expansive, squeaky clean and probably the best KFC Outlet in the city, given it's glittering location. The service is good too, the people there to serve you are pretty amicable,& ensure that the food is served to you in the least amount of time. The problem lies however, with the food itself and the corresponding prices.There's that hint of 'sameness' that hits you when you tuck into a  bucket or a zinger burger. Everything tastes practically the same, save the fiery grilled variant.A huge feast (like the one I had a month ago) tasted obnoxious once the food went cold. And again, it all tasted the same- popcorn, zinger burger, wings, hot& crispy pieces. 
The prices aren't pocket- friendly either, no matter how much KFC would like you to believe that a meal at their outlet is a cheap proposition. A couple of pieces of chicken along with a zinger burger would hardly satiate your hunger at lunch, but would slice off 300 bucks from your bank balance. 
But then KFC is after all, KFC. It sticks rigorously to the few things it specializes in& people throng KFC outlets the world over for them. I myself have been a KFC loyalist for a long time (KFC wins over MacD on any given day, for me) but it's the boredom that has crept in that is acting as a repellent. Refurbishment of the menu& introduction of exciting new items would again compel the foodie in me to blind- foldedly trudge into a KFC outlet& get lost in the signature KFC ecstasy again :)

Can you beat it? Kolkata Park street outlet in India packed me 2 Rizo Rice and greavy with leftover chicken instead of 2 Rice Bowlz. But that was stuffed in the rice bowlz. So it was not a mistake. They wanted to do away with the leftover rizo rice and greavy.The rice had soaked in the greavy and tasted awful. I have posted twice on facebook and recorded a feedback also but no one has contacted me. Seeing no movement from the KFC India, I am posting here

What is there to say separately about all the KFCs? They are all that great and yes it is the best burger joint in town. What I really enjoy every time I visit this particular branch is the most amazing ice-cream with brownies. KFC is completely recommended if you want a quick meal without a great pocket pinch. KFC is highly recommended if you want friends to just sit and chill out. KFC is amazing because it has stood the test of time and remained in a spot like park street while being surrounded by the most amazing restaurants all around.

On one of my many revisits to this outlet of KFC, I noticed a few changes. We had gone during the holiday season (was n fact on the afternoon of 23rd December) and it was understandably crowded. We thankfully managed a table on the upper floor.

For once, the order-taking was swift and almost all counters were functioning. My wife ordered her customary chicken strips, and fries which she shared with our daughter. I asked for a two piece fiery grilled chicken and a single fried chicken. We had cold coffee along with that.

The initial portion of the fiery grilled chicken was ridiculously small. I made them change it, but the replacement was not much better. KFC seriously needs to look into their servings. The strips too were not like before. The fried chicken was fairly reasonable in size, but not a patch on what they used to serve before. It seems a little underdone too.

KFC has unfortunately removed the southern (curry flavoured) friend chicken from its menu. It was kind of nice, something different if you ask me. 

They seem to have done off with the iced cappuccinos and moccachinos. Or perhaps they were not available. We settled for the regular cold coffee which was not impressive at all. Very small sized glasses. Okay so they were only about Rs 35 plus, but then again so what? They have also started serving the cold coffee from the dessert counter near the entrance.

The air-conditioning for once was fine... possibly because it was cooler outside. I wish they would have a separate basin for washing hands.... the one they have is just outside the restroom and it often remains dirty / smelly / occupied because of that.

KFC really needs to rethink its menu, and especially its portion sizes. It needs to maintain uniformity among its stores.



----- 23 Mar, 2013 -----

Visited the KFC Park Street outlet for a quick snack this afternoon (23 March 2013). Here are my observations:

1. The airconditioning was inadequate. At that time there was a solitary table empty, towards the back,and it was rather warm. Luckily got a better located table.

2.Ordered chicken strips (not as great as before... they tend to taste soggy), French fries (nothing exceptional), curry style fried chicken (nice but smaller that expected), 2 pieces grilled chicken (they gave me 2 legs when they are supposed to give one leg one thigh piece, I took it back and they said no thighs, and then had to get them get me a piece from the griller). They need to pay more attention to their servings.

3. Asked for strawberry crusher (shocked to see lesser quantity than before), cold coffee (automatically served smaller size; should have been asked preferred size. Got a chocolatey taste that shouldn't have been there).

4. Tried the new fresh lime soda. Not bad. Good value.

5. Had the cream ball desserts. Once again, good value and tasty enough. Some cake along with the crunchies would have made it an ever better deal.

6. Paid about Rs 800 for all this. That is not terribly cheap. But yes, with KFC one tends to feel less cheated than with others.

While looking at the menu I found KFC has introduced few new crushers. My friend Raj Chowdhury wanted to order ‚ÄòCrunchy Choco Lash‚Äô. After testing choco lash I think it‚Äôs worth every cent you spend. If you want a quick, filling meal with no hassles at affordable prices, drop in here.

Today, I called up KFC and the person on the other side of the call was very polite and it was one of my best experiences while placing an order(when compared to Subway and McD).

I ordered their Rice in a Bowl and It was spectacular. The rice was well cooked and the gravy was also flavored well. 
It was quite filling and all in all, a pretty  satisfying meal.

The icing on the cake I guess would have to be the packing of the Food. It came in a carry bag and the Bowl itself it handy enough to be eaten out of even while walking.

Looking forward to ordering more. :)

KFC is one of the most popular fast food joints in the city and is extremely popular with the younger crowd. It was for me and several of my friends  a place to meet during our college days. The place is nice, the decor chic and the staff courteous enough.  It was a good place to have a bite before catching a movie. However, for all that it offers, it never really gives a good dining experience. Yes, the fried chicken tastes good, and the Chicken Zinger Burger is definitely worth trying. Spinoff offering like the Chicken popcorn and the Chicken Twister are also worth trying. The problem is there is almost no variety and after some time almost everything tastes the same. Moreover, I usually found the food to be highly priced compared to the dining satisfaction it offered.This is of course my own opinion.

One of the most popular fast food joints in Kolkata,kfc deserves the popularity.It was a huge hit when it first started and remains hugely popular even today.It is one of the most suitable places to have a quick meal,give treats and to hang out with college friends.Their crunchy fried chicken is very tasty and unique.The zinger burger,chicken snacker are also very good.I dont like the fiery grilled as much.I feel the crunchy chicken is far better.I quite liked the curry crunch which they started in between but I dont know why they have withdrawn it.The crushers and brownies are also very very good.The only thing is that all the crushers in the menu is not available all the time.The prices have increased and the amounts decreased of late which takes away some of the charm.But still it remains one of the best fast food joints,much much better than McD.

I used to love KFC but I recently heard how they use manipulated stuffs and used to call them chicken. However it's totally my own reason not to visit KFC. That's why they have changed their name from Kentucky fried chicken to KFC. I used to love their chicken snacker but I am very disappointed that they are serving such stuffs calling them as Chicken. Not planning to visit it again. It's my own choice. The news about KFC was all over flooded over Facebook. For further details google. :)

Even though I have stopped visiting KFC for purely personal reasons I thought it would be unfair not to write about this chain store which was our favourite eatery to visit during our college days. I have recently read this beautiful article on NDTV24/7's website where a girl describes how our appetites are sometimes manipulated by American sitcoms and as a result when KFC had opened its doors our joy's knew no bound. We were delighted at the prospective of having Fried Chicken the Southern American comfort food and not just North Calcutta's 'Chicken fry' . For the first few years we could not get enough of the batter covered crispy and juicy chicken and the place at park Street is always clean, hygienic and the service is as sweet as possible from a chain store where the faces keep changing. While I admit that the original fried chicken and the crunchy chicken is excellent when it comes to taste and there is no doubt that it being pocket friendly , it shall be the place where college students celebrate all sorts of events . Now coming to my criticism, it might seem like a social rant  but once you step out of your extended teen years in college sometimes you have certain realizations and even I had such a realization. Unlike the person who motivated me in this direction I do not really care in which countries pocket the money is going but what is alarming is that a store from this chain shop popping up everywhere is destroying our own culture. We have excellent versions of the fried chicken, not Southern American style but a different one both in the eastern metropolitan city and the western metropolitan city  of our country. As a logical human-being I cannot but be against a chain food store which destroys cultures across the globe. Even though their staff is ever polite as is the policy of the company you wouldn't see the same face after a decade or so.  Personally there is a sense of warmth in seeing the old faces of old food joints.

This is another electrifying Fast Food joint in the City of Kolkata. I have eaten at KFC atleast 10 times if i can recall but i guess this is the first time that i might be giving a review in regards to this amazing restaurant, since i have been introduced to zamatoes only recently and i simply love this site where i can pour in my expertise of being an food tastier, and share in my opinions for the rest of the foodies, who should really value good food and do not hesitate to chuck the brickbats when there find a joint where the food is deplorable, unpalatable,contaminated for which might jeopardize the health of the foodies.

KFC is another fast food joint that has maintained its prolific standards, and its quantity, the zinger burger is something that is smashing in taste and in terms of filling your pangs of hunger.You talk about the Chicken wings and chicken nuggets they are definitely masterpieces, the french fries are also world class standards.

You can't really go wrong with a KFC. Quick, Filling, Cheap and might I say absolutely "finger licking good". This outlet happens to be the largest one in the city and is located right at the heart of Park street, making it almost impossible to miss. The servers always have a smile and unless your order is something extraordinarily different from the norm, serve your food quite fast. One thing which must be mentioned is that a proportion of the servers here are disabled and KFC is doing a great job providing them with employment - as they say a little good will goes a mighty long way. 

The Zinger burger is always a delight, as are the chicken strips, popcorn and original recipe chicken. For a beast of a hunger there are few better cures than the Zing Kong box. Desserts are average, remember its the chicken you visit KFC for. Overall, a great, greasy, and tasty eating experience. Lets all raise a chicken drumstick for the good ole colonel.

Overall :
Food - 4.5
Service - 4.5
Ambiance - 4
Value - 4

The best kfc outlet in town. I am a huge fan of their ambience. Love their printed walls,hanging first floor, ah! Now nobody needs a description of what they offer. Amazing fried chicken legs, chicken pop corn , etc. i am a die hard fan of their fiery grilled chicken and zinger meals. The burgers have generous amount of mayonnaise. In summer, crushers are a must have! They have introduced kreamball Sundae which is vanilla ice cream spoilt with oreo crumbs and a yummy topping of chocolate sauce! This outlet is a main attraction in the expensive park street for a low budget yet classy treat!

KFC used to be such a favorite. From the hot zinger burger to the classic fried chicken. And then it all started to go wrong. I didn't like the fiery grilled ones from the start. too much oil in fried chicken. I had oil dripping down my fingers. The zingers  turned horrible with time. The bread was cold,the chicken patty not upto taste. Even the classic fried chicken lost its taste. And to add to it the smell of stale oil. Leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Even my very resilient stomach has failed to counter the KFC curse. Looking forward to a revival.

KFC is one of the best fast food joints in the city, much better than McD. The stuff that are really good here are obviously the Zinger Burger and the Fried Chicken. The Rizo Meal is always a delight, as is the Brownie. One downside here is that many a time I did not get my first choice of Krusher, Having said that the food is great and the staff are friendly and all orders are prompt. A 3.5 on 5 for KFC.

I think this was one of the first kfc outlet in Calcutta and man, was it good then! I used to be crazy about the Zinger burger. No other chicken burger tasted as good as it did till four years back at this kfc outlet. However with time and with a no. of other introductions to the menu, gradually kfc quality has gone down. 

The latest introduction to the menu(  yes the tiny portions served at rs 25) are not bad at all. I really like the small chicken nuggets. juicy inside, crispy on the outside, just perfect to satisfy your chicken cravings. I still like their chicken hot wings,  a lot!!!

Park St KFC used to be the joint we would haunt after a long evening, because this place would stay open till around 11. I would come here with a friend and order a bucket of fried chicken. And then proceed to fight over the drumstick (in this case, it would be a situation where i would try to pass it off to my friend, and my friend would try and do the same). 

Recently KFC has added some new stuff to their menu, suited to college crowds. Of them I like the potato burger. Its pretty much yum and although I am an hardcore non veg person, I like it a lot. Apart from that I also love their cold coffee. That is definitely an improvement over limp and sad cold coffees served around town. I have an affinity for Krushers, especially the choco lash, and I think its worth every cent you spend.

I have never put in too much faith in their grilled chicken and stuff. For me, KFC is an indulgence where grilled kills all happiness. So yes, KFC is a place i return to when the craving for big pieces of hot and crispy chicken hits me.

Food is descent although the meals are unique hence creating a monopoly with its fast food! It will keep attracting a lot of people, however I have lost interest in this food. Good that they are coming up with new items. But I still miss the Smashed Potato I had had in a Singapore branch. I wonder when this will start preparing the same. Overall its good considering how much you're spending!

KFC always calls to my soul, tempting me with its chicken popcorns. The zinger burger is also very good. Wings are also good. The smoothies are good, too. I tried out crushers at this specific outlet right when they were introduced. 

The staff is decent and helpful.

But, the prices are going up like a rocket, which is really disappointing. Also, the place is always so crowded.

Everybody knows about KFC and it's a super duper bumper hit in India especially Kolkata. You would never expect any outlet to be empty. In fact you might just see that there is a lack of space to sit down as it is majorly noticed in the Esplanade outlet. You have to stop by and want to pack some food the answer is KFC, you want to give a treat to friends-KFC, you want to celebrate a birthday-KFC, you want to treat office colleagues or make an office lunch-KFC, on a long drive packed food-KFC. There are endless reasons why you would want to go there but very few as to why not. It is also probably the world's second largest chain of restaurants after Mc Donalds. Harland Sanders or as he is well known today as Colonel Sanders  began selling fried chicken from a roadside restaurant in Kentucky. A lot like Mc Donalds(if I am not wrong) it did not stay with him and he sold it off. 
So if it is KFC and everyone knows about it then why am I writing this review?? Well it is for the sole reason that I just love this outlet. Memories fill up with this particular KFC outlet. If a lot can happen over coffee surely lot has happened at KFC with me, in this outlet. 
Probably the biggest standalone outlet in Kolkata and it has always got something to offer. I remember that even if my motive is not to go to KFC I still end up going to it while waiting in the queue for Peter Cat to get some Krushers.
Now KFC has been holding many parties out here one of which was my cousin's birthday and they had organized it very well with the staff playing games with the children who were the invitees and well decorated with balloons. 
KFC menu is diverse and I still miss the boxmaster which had aloo patty along with chicken in a wrap. However the food menu is pretty diverse and they have kept on adding more to their old one. However the Crispy fried chicken and the Zinger burger still remain my favourites and I prefer the Mc. D fries to it. They have numerous meals and rizo rice and all but I do not like the rice. The curry flavoured chicken is a good add to have once in a while but I do not like the fiery grilled chicken also. The buckets help when there are many of you together.  Am neither a fan of the wings or the chicken twister.
Many have the feeling that veg at KFC is not worth it but I have given it a try and the veg zinger is the best veg burger I have ever had.
They have a wide range of krushers  and sundaes to choose from as people may react differently to the taste but my favourite krusher is the mango one.  
You have to believe in the tagline finger licking good.I remember how I once used the line "taste ko waste mat karo darling" and it paid off( if you know what I mean :P)

Its a KFC. 
So, food quality and menu remains more or less the same across all the outlets of Calcutta.
The only thing different about this KFC, I reckon, is the carpet area, which is large enough for parties (we had one today with 17 people), and the location.

The Zing-Kong Box meal on offer is a tad better than Big Mac's Maharaja.

Gets a 3.5/5

Sometimes when I can't fight the craving for fried chicken,KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is the place that comes to my mind!!!

Well,you won't find anything but proper, TOP-QUALITY chicken on their menu!!!!!!
I've been to this location of KFC a few times and have always been surprised at the speed of service.

Have tried out the following:-

-Chocolate Kreamball sundae
-Chicken popcorn
-Boneless strips
-hot wings
-Dips bucket(12 strips+ 4 dips)
-Vanilla blue sparkling krusher

You get texture and taste,but most importantly, you INDULGE in the sundaes and krushers!!

Catering for vegetarians is provided. 
They have a very efficient cashier/ordering system.

Their CHICKEN WINGS are lightly breaded in special seasonings and fried to crispy perfection!!!
CHICKEN POPCORN pieces are marinated for a tender inside and breaded for a flavourful, fun crunch on the outside!!!
I wait longer than some of the people who order their items after me. I am not complaining.  I figure what's worth waiting is worth getting, and such is the case with the CHICKEN DIPS BUCKET (Four dips : Sweet Chili , Tangy Salsa,Spicy Mayo,Oriental) !!

Well,I still don't know which is more fun: the walk to KFC from my college, or the walk back from KFC.......

This particular outlet gets a 4 on 5 !!

Kentucky Fried Chicken or KFC needs no introduction. I would rate the park street outlet as I find it the cleanest and one with the best ambiance among all outlets. 
Almost everything at KFC is yummy. The best thing that I have always loved about KFC is the Spicy Chicken Wings. Its just irresistibly tasty. The Chicken Popcorn is another favourite which has taken snacking to a new level. I had never imagined that my Popcorn would be so amazing that I would be licking my fingers. The Chicken bucket isn't a personal favourite as I find portions of it non-crispy. The Zinger Burger (both Veg and Chicken) is always a safe bet as it outclasses the Mac D burgers by miles. Among the beverages, the Mango Crusher and Green Apple Crusher are favourites. I always end up having the Mango Crusher as it just tastes heavenly. 

The seating at KFC is decent and so is the ambiance. Its always bustling with people and its difficult to get seats at times. A very special mention of the concept of KFC that I have loved is the employment of Deaf and Dumb attendants at most KFC outlets. Its really Novel and Heart Warming.

The pricing is a bit steep but the taste makes up for it reasonably well. Moreover its very filling  and you end up having a decent meal at 200 per person. 

A personal favourite, 4.5 stars for KFC.

KFC. 

Ah yes. 
The American-Indian KFC.

Without a doubt, its the place to go for crispy chicken. But as far as the Finger Lickin' Good goes, there is much more to be expected.

With franchises in almost every major part of the city, Kentucky Fried Chicken has come a long way since its first few days. Quality always remains an important part of the diet at KFC and this is one of those food chains that constantly draw up new and improved 'combo' offers to draw the common man to it.

Yes, the Zinger Burger remains my favorite. But strangely inconsistent.
The Chicken Wings are the same forever. Tasty. Simple.
French Fries and Coke are standard.

What stands out for me is the new line of drinks. The Virgin Mojito, the Chocolash and the Chocopeanut Bolt are brilliant and is the saving grace.

The new line of Popcorn Chicken is good and is slightly better tasting than the normal Chicken pieces.

FINAL VERDICT - Its a standard. KFC has a particular standard and it has always lived up to it. All it needs is a little bit of consistency throughout its different shops. And that is what Colonel Sanders would have wanted.

When KFC first opened in Kolkata, it was a craze. However, as the craze died down, it gradually became clear that the quality of their food - and more importantly, service - was not up to the mark any more.

However, being reasonably priced - especially if you are in groups of three or four - and filling, you can always try out a meal or snack here. The snackers, zinger meals and burgers are all-time favourites. There can be no question about the superb chicken or the soft buns, but the hurried presentation sometimes ruins it : your burger may end up with mayonnaise dirpping all over the lower bun and two inches of lettuce protruding. These are mainly due to rush hour nervousness, but hey, we're paying for it and we expect a value for our money!

However, I personally like KFC - ironically - for their non-chicken items. The crushers are absolutely amazing and on a hot sultry summer day, it's the second best thing to a traditional nimbu-paani and irrespective of whether your chicken is finger licking good or not, you definitely will want more of these refreshing drinks. The Kreamball which is excellently priced at Rs. 49 (1$) apiece is also a fantastic dessert, with a chocolate, mango or strawberry syrup  served tastefully on a layer of ice-cream that hides a treasure trove of chocolate powder beneath it. This lip-smacking dish is just too good.

Verdict: If you want a quick, filling meal with no hassles and are looking for an American snack option at affordable prices, drop in here.

Whenever I come home to Kolkata, I make it a point to visit this place. The awesome zinger burger and the chicken bucket is something I look forward to every time I am here (mainly because the place where I currently live does not have a KFC!) Apart from its location, I have always been a fan of KFC's service, especially because they always serve with a smile!

Undoubtedly kfc is my most favourite 'chicken having place' in Kolkata. It is one more popular place to hangout with friends. I just do not understand that how do they prepare the chicken and the tin crispy outer layer... It  is absolutely mind-blowing. I visit there very rarely especially with my friends and i have almost visited 7 to 8 times. The music being played over there is cool and ambiance is calm...pricing is also reasonable....now coming to food.....chicken is immensely good here,,,my favourite is the Popcorn chicken which i have two packs of the large size and the kfc chicken is excellent. The chicken legs are soft and crispy and the Zinger burger is great too. Kfc has never been unsuccessful to delight me....Hot Wings are very nice which are so tasty and yum.'Finger lickin' good' is just suitable for them and i am going to rate  4.5 for them. Now location,,,,its located beside Sourav's and oppsite of Peter Cat and alsmost all the time its packed up. Service is quick. In PArk Street it is one my most favourite restaurant. Oh! One more thing,,,,the Chicken Twister MEal is one more interesting thing out there(superb)......All the best for KFC.........Must visit there and i think ou have already visited there several times.

At one point of time I adored KFC and would have been happy to eat two meals a day there .... however of late the way the quality of the food has spiraled downwards has taken me by surprise considering its international reputation. The hot and crispy chicken pieces which I loved are not being cooked properly .... there is a stale taste in the oil ... even the chicken strips which were my favorite are just not the same .... the popcorn chicken is slightly better and perhaps the only thing I occasionally partake of here of late .... the saving grace are the crushers and the soft twirl and ice-creams.

I decided to write a review for the Park Street outlet for I have probably visited this one most number of times and have plenty of memories attached to this place. 
Calcutta must owe a lot to Colonel Sanders for gracing the city with his school of Lickonomics(Iam sure Sanders understood the economics behind it very well as well)..Coming to the food,having tried almost everything that KFC has to offer from the Chicken Zinger Burger to the Popcorn Chicken from its soft Choc Amor(which Iam in love with) to the Krushers(my favourite being the Choco Peanut Bolt and the Virgin Mojito) and its Brownie sundae to the Pocket Friendly Snackers,everything truely is in tune with their catchphrase "Its finger lickin' good" 
P.S even if you are a vegetarian KFC wont disappoint you..They have an equally delectable spread lined up for the veg lovers!

located at the zestful shopping mall of kolkata, city center, this KFC is a cool hangout place for youngstars. the menu is good for non vegeterians. though veg eating friends can also accompany you for having a chana tikki burger. you can also take  a break from your shopping spree and enjoy a delicious zinger burger or sinful hot and crispy chicken. on weekends its not unusal to find a long que in front of the outlet. great taste, great value for many.
