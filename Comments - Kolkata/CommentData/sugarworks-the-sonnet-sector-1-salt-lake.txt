November ends! December is just about to set in. Such is the time when the preparations for the celebration of the birth of the Christ begins. This is the happy time of the year, when the world awaits the coming of the 25th with absolute happiness and bliss. . Christmas is no fun without the traditional Christmas cake; and making this cake is not a quick, easy simple step. Preparations begin months in advance. The first step towards making the cake is the mixing process, formally called the ‘Cake Mixing Ceremony’, a ritual religiously followed the world over and said to be a harbinger of good tidings and happiness.

Located inside the premises of The Sonnet, Sugarworks is the in house bakery. Its a small place by the lobby, pretty easy to miss on most occasions. The question worth asking though is, who’s loss would that be, ours or theirs? The answer to that question, will be better given after reading this crisp post.

Hummm... so what I'm saying in my Aura-The Sonnet's review that after tasting there pastries on the table... I asked them from where I will get it...And they showed me these tiny little place just beside the entrance... as we are in a hurry I forgot to take photos of it... it had a beautiful showcase where you can see so many varieties of colourful pastries giving smile at you...

I taken some pastries to try at home... which are as follows...

 ♡ Butter scotch»»» Excellent one... beautiful, soft and flavors...
♡ Eggless truffle»»» Delicious mouth watering... good one with right amount of sugary taste...
★ Strawberry»»» Good...
★ Blueberry cheesecake»»» Also very tasty... 
★ White forest»»» Although I was not fond of white forest but as black forest was not available I replaced it with that... But the decision proved right... it was good too... not awesome like black forest but ok...
♡ Black forest»»» Awesome one... I had it on the table... Will try it again...

Basically what I liked about there pastries was there serious sugar works on it... not too sweet nor totally bland... just tends to perfect...
Nothing much too mention about there ambience, deco, staffs and service... all are very good..

Pocket pinch was bit high here...

While In salt Lake, I had to pick up pastries for guests coming in and sonnet was closest to me. A small kiosk at the entrance of the hotel, neat and tempting pastries lined up. I picked up one peice of all that was there. The butterscotch pastry was yummy, the blueberry cheesecake was really sad, the chocolaye one was the best, the blackforest was a delight too. A strawberry pastry which was decent. I would ho back for more :)

Sugarworks is situated inside the sonnet hotel.  It is a takeaway counter for all sugary stuff as the name suggests.
 I had a takeaway box from here consisting of a blueberry cheesecake, a white and black forest, a blueberry and butterscotch pastry.

The blueberry had completely melted thanks to the awesome Kolkata weather. The base of the cheesecake was not done properly I guess since half the part was missing. The filling needs to be worked on as well as the taste didn't come near to a cheesecake at all. Same with the blueberry pastry. Whatever flavour is used for the blueberry taste needs to be changed I feel. 
The butterscotch pastry was moist and not overly sweet. The sponge was soft and they had been generous with the scotch pieces so brownie points for it. 
The black forest was done nicely but the winner for the day was the white Forest and I have never tried a white Forest anywhere. This blew my mind. Not only was it topped with a cherry but also filled with chopped cherry pieces which mixed perfectly with the whipped cream inside. Oh the sweet pleasure in having that one was amazing. 
Overall a good counter. Some flavours need to be worked on. I am sure with some tweaking this will work perfectly. :-)

Sugarworks - A classy bakery section of the majestic Hotel Sonnet. Being a part of this exquisite leisure park this small yet flavourful bakery carries out its own distinctive charisma all along.

**Location**
Inside Hotel Sonnet situated near Saltlake City centre. You can locate the place keeping the ILS hospital as a landmark.

**Products**
They have a short and compact product line to be very specific towards the focus. Not too much not too less. Variety of Loaf ,cookies, savory ,pastries etc. As suggested by my friend

Went there couple of days ago.. This bakery is located at the ground floor of The Sonnet Hotel, tried some of their creations and I was amazed. Tried there Eggless Truffle which was also sugar free, I liked eggless pastries so definitely the truffle was good enough to pleasure my tastebuds. 
Secondly I ate White forest pastry, I never had white forest before but being a white chocolate lover that pastry justified my love.
After that I tried Butterscotch pastry, quite good, but taste was very normal, not impressive. The black forest cake was so good, very soft and it has balance cream on it, no so sweet and not so dull.
After that I tried blueberry cheesecake and blueberry pastry, both were average. 

Presentation great for all of the pastries. Pcs were bog enough for one people.. service were very good also.

Sugarworks is a small kindred bakery of The Sonnet hotel. And even inside the grandeur of The Sonnet, it has its own distinctive flavour. As a part of Sonnet's food theater experience we tried out a few of Sugarworks delectable offerings. The presentation of each of the pastry made them look appetizing even from afar. They were so fresh and delicious that we left with a heavy stomach and a heart filled with a desire to return.

We started of with Butterscotch Pastry. While the rich creamy flavour will engulf you, the interspersed butterscotch will give you a little crunchy feel.

Then we moved on to the Chocolate Eggless Truffle Pastry(sugar free). Since I'm a chocolate lover, I found this to be one of the best pastry's of the evening. I was completely enthralled but its richness of flavour and its subtle sweetness. This is the pastry for all you vegetarians and sugar conscious people. I'm very fond of cakes with egg, since it gives that extra softness but this cake was totally and completely perfect. If my server didnt mentioned, i would have never realized that it was eggless. A sure shot must try if you are ever here.

Then we moved on to the Black Forest Cake. This cake was definitely tasty and all the flavours blended well.

After black forest we had the Blue Berry Pastry. This subtle cream made it taste grand.

Then arrived the White Forest Cake. While i'm not too fond of white chocolate cakes since they turn out to be too sweet, i was completely amazed by the flavours of my white forest cake. The sweetness was absolutely appropriate and the texture of the cake was perfect.

Finally we had the best at the last : Blue Berry Cheese Cake. This cheesecake looked appetizing and tasted exquisite. The rich creamy flavour of the cheescake blended flawlessly with light blueberry cream. While a lot of cheese cakes turn out to be a little hard, this was so soft that it will melt in your mouth. The flavours were subtle and you will surely be left wanting for more. Another must try if you are ever here.
