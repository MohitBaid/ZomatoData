Tiny place opposite e mall, serves some of the best chinese food in the city. Although a bit over priced due to lack of ambience and sitting arrangement. Best Korean rice you will eat in India.

As said , Don't judge a book by its cover , crystal chimney is one such place serving excellent chinese food .This hidden gem is located bang opposite to emall at chandni chowk next to Anand's Restaurant. Dine in option is extremely cramped on the mezzaine floor with 4 tables for four and a table for two. However air-conditioning and basic interiors are done . Elderly people might have difficulty climbing up the narrow spiral stairs , hence take away is the best option.
Coming to the food , we ordered GRAVY MIXED NOODLES and DEVIL'S CHICKEN.. what a lipsmacking combination!! The best dish was the LEE FU FISH , its a must try if you fond of garlic coriander sauce. This time they ran out of Lapchi kai chicken , the most popular dish from their kitchen , would be back soon to try out that as well. Quick service and no added taxes come as bonus.

I am very fond of chinese cuisine and so decided to drop in to this joint after seeing it's been listed in the hidden gems section in Zomato. It is located just opposite E-mall and so was very easy to find. It is a very small place where there are only 18 seats to be exact. The place is nothing fancy. You would see a spiral iron staircase leading to the upper floor. Just basic decor and furnitures. The staff are really helpful and polite. They really help you in choosing dishes. We ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, Mixed noodles gravy and Lee Fu Fish. The soup was really tasty. It was quite thick with ample amounts of chicken , eggs and corn. The mixed gravy noodles was awewome too. The gravy was perfect in flavour. It had good quantity of veggies, chicken, prawn, egg. The quantitywas enough for 2people. The Lee Fu fish was quite different from what I have tasted so far. The gravy was a bit spicy which went well with the noodles. The fish pieces were quite good in size and perfectly cooked. The only thing they need to improve is that fish inside lacked in taste as the gravy did not go inside and so made the inner a bit bland. I loved the experience. The perfect place to satisfy chinese food cravings without burning a hole in the pocket. And guess what no GST is charged in the bill.

We came by for dinnee and ordered shanghai chicken and mexican fried rice .
Mexican fried rice was really good with a very good quantity.  
Shanghai chicken had a little too much gravy and was slighty on the spicier side . 
But a very good meal.  The waiter was very sweet.  
I wish the stairs wasnt as steep.  
Coming back next time im in town

Talking about the food, it was absolutely delicious. Me and my friend were hungry and after searching in zomato, we landed here. It was worth the try. We ordered mixed noodles along with Shanghai chicken. The quantity they serve is enough for two people. We were full after having it. Had a good experience trying Chinese food here.
But they serve momos here after 3pm . My friend was so annoyed by this fact üòÖ
The space here is too small.
But overall we liked it

Visited this restaurant yesterday, this place is located at Chandni opposite to chandni chowk metro station
A pretty cramped restaurant can hardly accommodate 20 people
Ordered 
Chicken clear soup
Crispy chicken
Chicken fried rice
Chily fish
The soup was a disaster
The crispy chicken was too much spicy though was cooked well
The rice & chilly fish were excellent
The final bill came around 832 ...
Too much for a place like this
The menu has not been updated in the zomato , kindly update it...

‚û° Location : Chandni Chowk, Kolkata ( Opposite E-mall)

After a hectic coaching class I visited this place with my boyfriend.
The staff was good he helped us in picking the recommended dish of the restaurant i.e. Lapchi Kai Chicken which was amazing ( highly recommended )
We also ordered mix fried rice which was also tasty.
Quantity for 2 person was more than enough.
Surely a visit for a good food quality and quantity without burning a hole in your pocket

One of the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.
Don't judge it by it's ambience only go here if you are carving for good authentic Chinese food.
A warning u will never be able to finish full plate of any dish on Ur own. The portion is extremely large and filling. More than enough for 2 people.
We ordered a special chilli garlic mixed fried and chicken Shanghai along with it.
We were 2 hungry guys who were in Chandni for some purpose and we bumped into this place for lunch.
P.S. Our stomachs were defeated by the huge portions and we had to pack half the chicken Shanghai.

This is a very small place loacted opposite to E-Mall at chadni chowk... 
Place is very small but comfortable, service is good as there is only one person attainable 20 people at most... service is slow...
Coming to the food we ordred 

1ST Mei-Foon Noodles --- This dish comes in huge quantity and the taste is amazing, one of better noodles dishes i have tasted in kolkata... 

2ND Mongolian Mixed Rice --- This dish us also huge in quantity almost enough for 3, tasted really good a bit on the schezwan side, it is a decent dish... 

3RD Lap-Chi-Kai Chicken --- Now this dish is the best of this lot, crispy sweetnes mashed with very spicy gravy, it is mouthwatering a bellyburner and an amazing chicken dish... 

Overall for that lap-chi-kai chicken will visit more times in future...

Crystal Chimney is a old Chinese restaurant near Chandi Chok metro , just beside Anand Restaurant , opposite of electronic mall.
Just enter the restaurant and you will find a spiral iron stair to reach the upper deck of the restaurant which is very small n cosy. Though the space is a big constrain but it was pretty neat n clean. Sitting capacity is 6 four sitters table which can accommodate 24 person max.
Now the main thing the food. Food is pretty awesome compare to other Chinese joints nearby. We had Mix Fried Rice (215/-) and Lee Fu Fish (150/-).
Quantity was more than enough for two persons. It was full of shrimps and chicken tasted  really nice. Lee Fu Fish was perfect companion with the rice. It's taste was something new to me. Never had anything like that in Chinese menu. It's a must have dish. More than enough satisfied with the food's quantity n quality.
Total bill was 365/- (Thank God...No GST).
Will return soon to taste rest of the dishes.

This place is located near Chandni Chowk Station and has absolutely no ambiance. It's a tiny place with 5 tiny tables and even less space to stand and there's exactly 1 waiter for all the work. Also, it was slightly unhygienic, some of the prawns were not de-veined properly and I was also greeted by a tiny hair in the soup. Keeping those aside, the food was mind blowing. The crystal chimney special soup was simply delicious as was the sliced fish with garlic and pepper which was crispy and slightly sweetish. The lapchi-kai chicken was beyond words in taste but I personally felt it shouldn't be classified as a starter but a main course side dish. The crystal chimney hakka noodles were also quite good and came with an omelette and prawn crispies. The schezwan chicken felt ordinary. But the soup, the fish and the lapchi kai chicken are a must try. The food here is great in taste, quantity, quality and the crowd of people waiting to get seated is proof of their popularity. Every foodie must try.

Went to this tiny joint about a year or so back after recommendations from a group of friends who insisted this frequented place of theirs as a cheap dine-in for hangout. To my bewilderment, the 'tiny' part is an understatement. This eatery has a really small space which is accessed by one of the narrowest winding stairs I've ever witnessed. The place is rustic and good for college students on a budget who would be satisfied with run-of-the-mill food quality.

We ordered Chilli Baby Corn, Chicken Lollipop, Mongolian Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Chowmein and  Manchurian Chicken. The proportions were apt for the cost in a budget restaurant. The quality is nothing to recommend about but apart from a funky flavour in the rice, that I couldn't quite place, it was decent.

The place was packed and with such a small space, there was no privacy. Words spoken at any table can serve as 'entertainment' since it reaches with ease and clarity! The service was nothing repulsive but this place can at times feel a bit unwelcoming if you aren't with a group. And most importantly, with such a small and crammed seating available, we had to wait over 20mins to get seats(can't hold that against them though, since this isn't remotely supposed to be a fine dining option but an abrupt unplanned walk-in or a place for a frequenter).

The name Crystal Chimney may not inspire instant cognizance, in fact, when I read about it, I didn‚Äôt know where this place was. I have been to Chandni a few hundred times but the name did not ring a bell, not even the tiniest one. When you think about it, you cannot help but wonder ‚Äì ‚ÄúShould I know about this place?‚Äù After all, amidst the gazillion of old-school restaurants in the area, who cares about a tiny place with a bright red hoarding? Who cares about Crystal Chimney when there‚Äôs Chung Wah a few paces away? Who cares if it‚Äôs bang on the road, perfectly visible, when the piping hot Rezala is waiting for you at Sabir‚Äôs? Well, I didn‚Äôt. But now, I do. And once you pay them a visit, I‚Äôm sure you will too. Here‚Äôs the story.

I visited this place last October as well, and this was a phase when I was really hunting down the hidden gems and old-school restaurants in Kolkata i.e. the ones I had never been to. Crystal Chimney was not very high on my pecking list, but on reading the enthusiastic reviews about their Lapchi Kai Chicken, I decided to pay them a visit. The first time I went, it was a Monday, and the place was closed. Somehow, I managed to pay them second visit, for dinner, on a rainy evening. The place is tiny, and as incredible as it may sound or look, it is two-storied. The ground floor is the cash counter and the kitchen, and the first floor has a few tables for the diners. There‚Äôs a small spiral staircase that leads you to the tables, and the place is so small that you climb the stairs quite disbelievingly. Well, let that not put you off, because as small as it may be, they have neat and clean facilities with an A/C thrown in. Perfectly good irrespective of gender, caste, religion. The first blow was that the Lapchi Kai was over, and that brought us to our confrontation with the menu card ‚Äì it‚Äôs damn huge! Their menu is so extensive that it would provide for a good afternoon read, and then some! After much deliberation, and some questions (which the attendant answered well), we called for half a plate of Lee Fu Fish, half a plate of Devil‚Äôs Chicken, and a plate of Mixed Hakka Noodles.

The Lee Fu Fish is a coriander-garlic sauce based preparation, and even if I do not generally order this item, I loved the one here. The sauce was very flavorful and the coriander was not overdone, which is very important. The quality of the fish was good. The Devil‚Äôs Chicken was even better. The gravy is based on tomato and chili sauces, with a sharp taste of dried red chilies. With the bite size tomatoes, capsicum, and onions, and the punch of the chili, this dish came together superbly to complement the noodles. The gravy was lip-smacking good. The noodles were great as well, transformed by the use of black pepper (you can even see it in the pic), which is my favorite spice. The general standard of noodles is pretty good in Kolkata, and Crystal Chimney makes it quite well. That ended a sumptuous meal for two, and we left for the evening.

However, the Lapchi Kai was on my mind. When I visited Kolkata this year in February, I made it a point to call them at 4pm and parcel a plate of Lapchi Kai Chicken. I then went to Adam‚Äôs Kabab (the best beef kababs in Kolkata) with a few friends, and after returning home, opened the container for dinner. Well, the aroma was fabulous ‚Äì sweet, sour, and smoky ‚Äì yes, that good. The portion size for this dish is enormous, and it is made up of eight large strips of chicken stir fried on high heat with julienne of bell peppers, onions, and fat red chilies. The sauce is again a combination of the usual Chinese ingredients, but the taste, oh boy. It‚Äôs simply one of the best, dirtiest, and satisfying concoctions I have tasted. The gravy is irresistible, and the chicken strips are well done, and you just can‚Äôt stop having it. I polished off the entire plate, and was craving for more an hour after! 

Crystal Chimney is one of the lesser known gems in Kolkata, and very suitable for having a great meal on a tight budget. The Lapchi Kai is obviously brilliant, and you should visit before 7pm, because it tends to get over by then. With Chung Wah‚Äôs deteriorating food quality, this can very well be your place for a meal after a few drinks.

If you are looking for quality chinese food at the cheapest price in the city , this is definitely the place for you . 
This is a small joint having only like 6 tables . 
But as with many restaurents in the city , you should never go by the looks  . 
Crystal chimney special chowmein is what you can't miss . 
Chicken lup chikai is my girlfriend's favourite . 
Would suggest you to try more of the starters as the main course is more filling than it looks . 
And at the end of an wonderful experience , they will hand you over a bill of just like 500 -600 rupees , which is way too cheap for two people . 
A heaven for college goers like me on a very low budget at times .

We were 4 people so we ordered mongolian fried rice, lee fu mixed rice and devil's chicken. Lapchi kai obviously GOOD. Though you can yry Lee Fu rice its green in color but tastes not bad and devil's chicken is yum.üòá I recommend all these food items.‚ò∫‚ò∫

It is located right opposite emall in chandni chowk. You have to climb up a small winding set of stairs to the air conditioned sitting area. You have to try their pan fried chilli fish, mexican mixed fried rice, tsing hoi chicken. Will definitely visit more times to taste their variety of food in their menu.

This place is really a gem. I went to this place with my office colleagues for lunch.

Pros:
1. Food is excellent and tasty.
2. Quantity is more than enough for one person.
3. Location is plus.
4. Staffs are good.
5. Food items are not very pricey.

Cons:
1. Seating are is very limited.
2. Servicing time is lengthy.
3. Ambience is nothing to talk about.

Do visit this place with enough time in hand to have tasty, delicious food.

This place is located right opposite e-mall. You have to climb a spiral narrow staircase to the 1st floor to get sitted. The seating arrangement is too cramped and uncomfortable. Food is good and ample in quantity. The chicken lap chi kai as everyone said is really tasty and well cooked. However the chicken shreds in their special fried rice were smelly and not fresh. Both of us had GI infection following our lunch here. If they improve their hygiene and ambience , they will make a mark in the chinese food cult of Kolkata.

Aptly featured in the 'Hidden Gems' section, the dingy entrance and a small inside may make you question its popularity, but the quality and quantity of their dishes will surely change your perception !!
Their mouth watering and delicious starters are a delight to your tastebuds, and their famous LAP CHI KAI CHICKEN !! has surely made a name for itself, and may well be one of the best chicken starters in town.
This was my 2nd time.theee, but the lap chi kai was finished for the day due to its sheer demand üò•üò•, so we ordered -
Crispy chicken in hot chilly sauce
Chicken lollypop
Mixed noodles
Mixed fried rice
Shanghai chicken
Li fu chicken
CRISPY CHICKEN & CHICKEM LOLLYPOP were really awesome and a must have after the lap chi kai (cant seem.to forget that dish).
Servise was a bit slow, but every items on their menu compensates for it
And lastly the price they charge you for their delicacous is quite reasonable(you may say cheap also!)

Do try this place once, you will surely not regret it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Moderately priced, a really small duplex outlet, with a total of 3 - 4 tables, with a seating capacity of 15 people approximately. Crystal Chimney is bang on the main Metro Station crossing at Chandni Chowk, right opposite to E Mall. The food is boderline classic "Kolkata-Chinese" cuisine, the city adaptation of Chinese preparations from the early Chinese settlers in Kolkata. We tried:

1. Mixed Fried Rice (classic, chicken, prawn & and egg) - 4‚≠êÔ∏è

2. Lapchi Kai Chicken (boneless pieces of chicken fried to a little crunch, prepared in a sauce which is little on the spicier side) - 4‚≠êÔ∏è

The service is not too shabby, and moderately paced. 

A good 4‚≠êÔ∏è for the food it has to offer. You may want to ignore the occasional "critter" you may find crawling up around the walls.

I went there after my tuition class for a quick bite having heard a lot about the place with a friend.. I would say I was a bit disappointed having found its so cramped  so that I could hardly take my bag up the spiral staircase. Anyway.. I ordered for noodles and a dry chilli chicken.. I was honestly BOWLED OVER the amazing and unique taste of both these..But then again ..The amount served was pretty small with respect to their price.. so.. the entire rating g I jave given is Only & Only for the Taste..No else was at all appealing to me.. will think again b4 visiting..

This restaurant is situated in chadni chowk. It's a small restaurant with 5 or 6 tables, but is worth a mention. The food here is totally "yummm"! It is mainly a Chinese restaurant. We tried barbecue chicken, chicken lollipop and mixed chowmin. If someone is looking only for delicious food without any fancy decor or ambiance, then it's a must visit place.

I stay quite close to this place and it serves very nice, flavourful chinese cuisine. Price is fine too. But the place is small, very small! Just next to Anand, Crystal Chimney is a restuarant you are suppose to miss out while passing from there but it is quite famous among local people because it does not create a hole in one's pocket.

Take it as a review or as an advice but you guys deserve making our restro big and decent. When i went here i was really not at all convinced by its looks that this place can provide us good and tasty food. 
But no i was wrong. The food was great in taste, and amount. 
People should try lat me kai chicken over here. 
The place is pocket friendly and really easy to locate!

It is a very small restaurant near the Chandni Chowk metro station. Like, really small. It has only 5 tables. The staff is very helpful.
We ordered the Lapchi Kai Chicken for starters, and the Lee Fu noodles and the Shanghai chicken as main course.
The Lapchi Kai Chicken is a famous starter of this restaurant and it has all the right reasons for being so. You are served eight big pieces (that is a whole lot of amount, if you are wondering) in a gravy, with a crunchy crust and soft, juicy chicken inside. It has an awesome blend of sweet, sour and tanginess, all in the right proportions, giving a heavenly feel in your mouth.
The Lee Fu Noodles are green in colour and has a very good taste. And the quantity! It can fill up four people with a normal appetite. We actually wondered if we were served one or two plates upon seeing the amount.
The Shanghai Noodles is one with a lot of vegetables and eight pieces of good sized chicken. The chicken was soft, and the taste was good.
Thing is, the starter is so, so good, you cannot really appreciate the others fully after eating it.
Go and try this restaurant. You may have to stand inna queue for the small space, but it is worth it.

It's a small fast food cum restaurant opposite e-mall. 
It's a small place with a capacity of 18 ppl sitting a time. Went here for a quick snack as I was passing by. Ordered only two dishes, so my review is strictly based on those two dishes.
1. Chicken Manchow Soup - Soup was not upto the mark. Had tasted much better Manchow soup, though the quantity was ok.
2. Chicken pan fried momo - It was tasty but had one complain with it ie the momo skin was too thick. It was more of dumpling rather than a momo.

Ambience - can't rate as it's a small outlet.
Service - 3.5/5
Food - 3/5
Value for money - 3/5

A small eatery in an office area with cramped space and difficult climb and seatings. 
The only saving grace is their food. But the very best of Chinese cuisine. 
I tried their Chicken Lollipop which is awesome. Also tried their Chilli Fish with Chicken based Yellow Curry Fried Rice. Both were good. 
Cost is high considering the space, but the quantity of the serving makes it up.
Revisit recommended sometimes when options run out.

We were very often to this joint around a Year back. Today we ordered for Chicken Steamed Momo, Noddle, Chilly Chicken & Garlic Chicken in Take away. 
They served Momos without soup. Noodles were full of Ajinomoto & finally they used rotten chicken in Chilly & Garlic Chicken. We will never try this Restaurant again though it was one of our favourite.

Quite expensive than other eataries near about chandni and central.zomato menu card is a old version one .actual price is more or less 30 rupees  Add on.in menu card it is said that all the prices are inclusive of vat.so the price is negotiable.but they also place service charge of about 26 rs.atmosphere and servicing is very average as far their presentation.so many negative negative comments still so high rating? Strange right? They are superb in terms of quality and quantity.if u have no constraint of budget and want to taste some true chinese food ,this place is for you.

The best place to have authentic Chinese cuisine while ur nearby chandni chill. The location as well is so good, right opposite to the E-Mall. Te place is a bit crowded at times but makes up for the food. The waiters are helpful in letting you decide you the best meal.

This place is located near Chandni Chowk Metro opposite E-mall and just beside Anand restaurant..  Easy to locate, but difficult to get seated in bcoz of space crisis..  There have been numerous times when I'v craved Chinese food but been forced to consume dosas next door,  thanx to the huge waiting  at lunchtime, even on weekdays.. The place also remains closed on Monday.. 
Coming to the interiors, there is nothing much to it..  A crazy steep staircase leads to a cramped upper level which seats around 10 people.. Best to remain nonchalant about the ambience and concentrate solely on the food.. 
Well, the food here is lip-smacking..  Menu is extensive and price is pocket friendly..  Quantity is exorbitant so order less to begin with.. Each and every dish is good, so you can go ahead and blindly order anything from the menu.. On my last visit, I ordered the Manchow soup and chicken spring roll,  both of which were great.  Chicken fried rice and Hong Kong chicken were also good..  
Service was a bit slow. 

I would go back again and again!!!! Just for the food.. And that is what I've based my rating on..Just this once,  I choose to ignore the rest coz the food more than makes up for it.. 
  If you are looking for amazing Chinese cuisine at decent price - this is the place to go to!!! Check it out!!!

We got it easy as compared to the other people who searched million times. We just asked for directions and found that its just opposite to the ezone mall. The place is like most of the cabins in College Street and the place could not occupy more than 5 group of people. Now coming to the main part whoch is the food.
The food is pretty filling to say and least and each dish is for 2 people. We ordered the famous and most reviewed starter which was the Lapchii Chicken. Lapchii chicken is 8 pieces of strips of chicken which was pretty big each and covered in the normal sauce. It was pretty good and It kinda filled us up. We had it with the famous Crystal Chimney Special Noodles. It contains 2 Prawn Pappads alongwith a big omlette of 2 eggs and a sufficient amount of Noodles. We were 4 and thus we ordered the Egg Chicken Chowmein later which was pretty average. We also ordered Devils Chicken along with it. Devil's Chicken looked like a pretty fancy named Dish until we tasted it. It was super spicy and literally made our eyes teary. It was delicious nonetheless. Finally we could not walk home and had to take a cab back home.

If you are off to Esplanade or Chandni Chowk area and looking for a joint serving good Chinese food with decent pay pinch then Crystal Chimney is the best place. Easy to locate and easier to go gaga over their food quality, this joint is just too good with their offerings. Dropped in couple of time and I really love their Drums of Heaven and Dragon Chicken. They serve sufficient amount of Rice and Noodles for a single plate. The option of ordering half plate of most of the side dishes is quiet convenient as it gives one an option to savor variety of dishes. Though the place is bit cramped up, interiors is also not significant one but prompt service along with good food at affordable price make up the shortcomings quiet well...

Heard so many things about this place from one of my mates and in Zomato it's a high rated food zone. First the location is opposite to e mall and very next to famous south Indian restaurant ANAND. It's a two storied building in which kitchen is in ground floor and dining arrangements is in first floor with.Air condition facility is available in the first floor. Second and the most important is quality of the food.
As this outlet is popular for Chinese cuisine..I went there yesterday around 9 pm. After the evening snacks I was in no mood to sit and dine over there. I asked about their signature starter but I was quite unfortunate yesterday. Hence the manager suggest me for pan fried chili chicken to mix with drinks and I asked one house special non veg fried rice. The bill was 443 rupees. When I just open them in home I was just surprised. The food pack was meant for 3 person on normal diet. The fried rice have prawn,egg,chicken..The taste was very good. Pan fried chilly chicken was yummy,spicy.happy with that order. Definitely will visit next time for other menu it

Nice food...specially Chilly Fish and Hot Sour Soup....We ordered Chicken Hot Sour Soup with Mushrooms. It was awesome. The best soup I ever tasted. We ordered Mixed Noodles with Chilly Fish and Chilly Chicken. Chilly Fish was too good. It was so soft that it just melted in my mouth. But Chickens were little hard. There were only few seats but if you manage it, you will surely find the Hidden Gems of Kolkata Food.Thank you Zomato for helping us to find out this Hidden  Gem of Kolkatan Foods.

Oh my good lovely authentic Chinese food. I have been visited that place many times. Excellent food and quantity also very good. There is only 5 table that is the main problem but the food was very good. You can try crystal chimney special rice and noodles, i am sure you will love that.

If you are off to Esplanade or Chandni Chowk area and looking for a joint serving good Chinese food with decent pay pinch then Crystal Chimney is the best place. Easy to locate and easier to go gaga over their food quality, this joint is just too good with their offerings. Dropped in couple of time and I really love their Drums of Heaven and Dragon Chicken. They serve sufficient amount of Rice and Noodles for a single plate. The option of ordering half plate of most of the side dishes is quiet convenient as it gives one an option to savor variety of dishes. Though the place is bit cramped up, interiors is also not significant one but prompt service along with good food at affordable price make up the shortcomings quiet well...

Heard so many things about this place from one of my mates and in Zomato it's a high rated food zone. First the location is opposite to e mall and very next to famous south Indian restaurant ANAND. It's a two storied building in which kitchen is in ground floor and dining arrangements is in first floor with.Air condition facility is available in the first floor. Second and the most important is quality of the food.
As this outlet is popular for Chinese cuisine..I went there yesterday around 9 pm. After the evening snacks I was in no mood to sit and dine over there. I asked about their signature starter but I was quite unfortunate yesterday. Hence the manager suggest me for pan fried chili chicken to mix with drinks and I asked one house special non veg fried rice. The bill was 443 rupees. When I just open them in home I was just surprised. The food pack was meant for 3 person on normal diet. The fried rice have prawn,egg,chicken..The taste was very good. Pan fried chilly chicken was yummy,spicy.happy with that order. Definitely will visit next time for other menu it

Nice food...specially Chilly Fish and Hot Sour Soup....We ordered Chicken Hot Sour Soup with Mushrooms. It was awesome. The best soup I ever tasted. We ordered Mixed Noodles with Chilly Fish and Chilly Chicken. Chilly Fish was too good. It was so soft that it just melted in my mouth. But Chickens were little hard. There were only few seats but if you manage it, you will surely find the Hidden Gems of Kolkata Food.Thank you Zomato for helping us to find out this Hidden  Gem of Kolkatan Foods.

Tummy filling foody experience. Oh! This is a hidden gem in the heart of my city. Sitting quietly with loads of flavors within a friendly price. Two storied 18 sitting place within 150 sq.ft area. Coming to food. We were two and ordered their crystal chimney special fried rice amd lapchi kai chicken. Truth is, I'm neither a fried rice person nor a chicken lover. But these two dishes were extremely good to help me get over my exclusions. Quantity can be shared between 3 easily. The bill was 540 with taxes and packaging charges as we couldn't finish the chicken. I will raise the rate when I get the pleasure of tasting other dishes presented by them.

A two storied small ac restaurant located at Chandni Chawk ¬†just opposite e-mall. ¬†The seating space is small, with just about 5 tables and seats around 20-30 people. But the food is absolutely delicious. I have been to this place a couple of times and it has never been a letdown. The manager out here is really friendly and helped us choose the dishes. I can't express how good they cook. Needless to say that I am very happy with both their quality and quantity. The place is not even pricy and it's a hidden gem in real terms.

This restaurant is neither new to me nor to my family. It's been more than 6 years that we are enjoying the food of Crystal Chimney. We have ordered food for home delivery many a times. 
Okay. To talk about the food, each and every dish served by this restaurant is delicious. The overall experience of the diners depend not only on the taste of the food but also on the presentation, texture, aroma, color and the portion size served by the restaurant. I would recommend Crystal Chimney for the people who love Oriental food.

Out of immense hunger I located a restraunt just opposite of the E-mall. It was at lunch time. Having no other option I decided to explore this restraunt. Chinese cuisine never gets old to me. And I didn't believe that the food will be good because of the shortage of space,limited seats. I tried Lee fu rice with garlic chicken. The staff was nice, and the food was nicer. Most importantly the money I spent was worthy

Well visited this one on yesterday evening. Opted for take away. So I'm only telling about the foods. Order was pan fried chilly fish, spl.tom chi noodles, sanghai chiken. All of them were very tasty. Specially the fish was an absolute delight, without any unpleasant smells and soft and fresh. Portion size is really good. One can easily share the food with other. Still I'm deducting some points because despite of making it very clear that don't make it too spicy, they made all of them way too hot to handle. Management please take care on this part.

I have passed by this restaurant hundreds of time (or maybe thousands), but never tried their food till today. Whenever I was around and craved for some Chinese food, either it was Chin Wah (Chung Wah till college days) or, if I had time, the eating houses of Old China Town. But today was different. We were hungry (read really hungry) and were short of cash (thanks to the demonetization of 500 and 1000 currency notes). We were looking for a Chinese restaurant nearby which will accept cards. Crystal Chimney was the first in the list to confirm over phone that they accept cards. Two hungry stomachs were saved!

LITTLE GEM
there is a 99.999%chance, you will miss the resturant if u are not looking carefully... its horizontally opposite e mall , chadni chowk..... 
very small would also be an understatement,its a tiny eatery
serves good chinese
but try to reach early or else be prepare to wait in a long line.. during lunch hours
price is reasonable
no ambience
no decor.
poor seating arrangements
a tiny flight of stairs reach u to the tiny eating place..

food is good..

recommended for take away
service should be more organized.
the rating 3.5 is just for the good food... nothing else

I guess happiness is when you get twice at a cost of one.. YES, Crystal Chimney belongs to that category.

Located at Chadni Chowk, just opp to E-Mall...So not a hard work to find it..

Visited this restaurant yesterday evening with my Foody friend Oishik Sarkar . I had heard about this restaurant from him, so was very curious about it. So yesterday evening after a hectic schedule when I was almost dying for a food then he come to fill my hungry tummy.....lol..He said why not try Cristal Chimney today??And I agreed with him b4 he finished his word...hahaha....

It is a small Chinese restaurant where the ground floor is mainly for Take out part and the first floor is for dine in. Little space, air conditioned, can accommodate hardly 15-18 persons at a time. One person was there who serves food to all.

Now to come the main part, food part...When it comes to choose dish, Oishik did my job. He ordered One Crystal Chimney Special Noodles and Lapchi Kai Chicken. After ordering, I asked him why not take two noodles, but his expression was like this ‚Äì ‚ÄòAare bhai tu vukkar hain main janta hu, but pahele khana toh aane de, fir order kar lena‚Äô.. After 2-3mins our food came and the surprise part started from that moment.

Crystal Chimney Special Noodle ‚Äì It was mainly a Mixed noodles with three Prawn papad. But Oishik has allergy to Prawn, so we told the person who was serving food to add double chicken in place of prawn. A big sized thick layer omelette was covered from the top which looks awesome. The noodles was perfectly cooked with other veggies, egg and chicken. Not so oily in nature till it tastes awesome...And when it comes the matter of quantity, it has no doubt that the quantity is pretty decent for two persons. So, Oishik you again earn my trust...:P

Lap Chi Chicken ‚Äì We (actually it was Oishik itself) ordered this one as our side dish.In one word, it was jst awesome...8 biiiiig pieces of chicken perfectly cooked with Spices, onion, capsicum etc. The dish was little tangy in one side and spicy on other side. This is the first time I tried such kinda dish. When it comes about Chicken Pieces, it was really big in size, juicy from inside and also little crispy from outside...Perfectly perfect..The quantity of the dish is more than enough for two persons. Very much recommended..

With two items, it cost 420. The price of every item is inclusive of all tax, so you don‚Äôt have to think about this, which is really a best part. Just a little amount of service charge was added.

So in conclusion, it is obvious that this restaurant is really a hidden gems at the Office para of Kolkata. Is it come about the matter of taste or quantity, it will satisfy you in both case. Go and try Crystal Chimney if you are a fan of Chinese cuisine, it will never let you down.
            

Yesterday when I visit the restaurant, I ordered the same item,. But this time ordered a soup as a starter. I want a mid spicy soup and they suggests us to take Chicken Manchow Soup and we take it. it was awesome in one word. Crispy fried noodles with thick soup, wow so amazing. not so hot in flavor but had a distinct garlic flavor in your mouth, which is great. Overall good..

Had been there recently. It is a small ac restaurant with not more than 6 tables and has a pretty humble interior. It is located just opposite to e mall near chandni chowk metro station. We saw the rave reviews this restaurant has got on zomato and decided to give it a try. We ordered veg mushroom fried rice and boneless shanghai chicken. I must say, the quantity for both the items was too good and more than enough for two persons, especially the rice. Now, coming to the food. Both the dishes were very tasty and we were quite satisfied. Also, price was quite affordable compared to the food we generally get at its price in some other restaurants. I would like to advice everyone to give this one a try. 
A tip- The restaurant should be decorated better to attract more people. I would have chosen to miss this one had I not read the reviews on zomato.

A small & very famous chinese joint in chandni chowk  situated just opposite of e-mall beside anand's. This small eatery is a hidden gem amidst all the hustle bustle of office area.

They offer varieties of chinese items to choose from. They have a small capacity of sitting,a bit cramped but somehow managed to squeezed it in for 4 tables with 4 seaters. 

We had the following:-

1. Chilli garlic chicken rice- We were impressed by the huge quantity of the rice plate. Could be easily shared by 2 people. A bit spicy with ample amount of chopped garlic cloves. The taste was fine quality wise. Loved it.

2. Lapchi kai chicken- Star of the evening for us. A senior of ours recommended this & oh boy we surely loved every bit of it. 12 pcs of thick crispy chicken fillet served in semi gravy of onions,red chillies & bell peppers. The taste was simply heavenly due to the hot & soury taste of the item. A must try & highly recommended.

The pocket pinch is fair as compared to their quantity of items. They charge service tax if you dine in. Service was efficient & satisfactory. Looking forward to try more of their dishes in the near future!!

Located just opposite emall, turn to this place for brilliant chinese.
The first thing you have to remember is that the quantity is HUGE, one plate fried rice/noodles accompanied by one side dish is more than enough for 2 people.
Been here twice, left with both my taste buds and stomach completely satisfied.
Will recommend the lapchi kai chicken as the speciality dish of this place.
Both the rice and noodles are huge and quantity and taste lovely.
The crystal chimney special soup had everything, eggs to mushrooms to chicken and what not.
Price is acceptable, considering the location and quantity. 
However, the ambience is terrible, staff behaviour is not helpful at all, and the place is terribly cramped.
Overall, just the tasty food accounts for a huge thumbs up.

We are home delivery regulars here. So much so that it has become our go to option for Chinese take-out. It is not much of a dine-in place for its cramped and not aesthetic interiors.But trust me ..the taste and prompt service makes up for everything. It's pocket-friendly,quality Chinese and Thai food ...though the latter is not upto the standard. They have the best meaty,juicy momos in town..the pan fried chicken momos,crispy chicken and crystal chimney special Korean rice are must-haves. Craving for soups on a rainy day after office ,you have to stop by at Crystal Chimney and you'll keep coming back again n again.

Approximate cost : INR 600 for two :)

It‚Äôs been months since I had Chinese food and it was absolutely essential for me to have some-I might have died if I hadn‚Äôt had any.

Zomato came to my rescue as usual. Featured under Kolkata‚Äôs Hidden Gems, Crystal Chimney is a astonishingly a small restaurant-you can pass by and never notice it. (Only if you haven‚Äôt heard of it, which I find kind of impossible because it is famous and undoubtedly stands up to the praise it receives!) The kitchen is downstairs. A sharp flight of stairs that leads you up to the air conditioned upper area- a small place crammed with four or so tables and chairs. This is one of those places which proves the idiom ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover‚Äù true flawlessly.
STAFF: Nice and friendly. The food will though take a while to come, so settle in.

FOOD: One of my friends had recommended me to try out their famous Crystal Chimney Special Soup and it truly was one of the best soups I have ever had. The soup was warm, delicious, mouth-watering and a tad bland- authentic Chinese soup. You might want to take your time with it or else you might end up burning your tongue like me.

As for the main course we ordered Lapchi Kai Chicken (recommended by Zomato) and Mixed Mei Foon Noodles (suggested by the helpful waiter). The chicken was full of flavour- cut in long sections, coated with thick batter and deep fried- cooked perfectly in a beautiful a-tad-sour and spicy sauce. The noodles were flavoursome and perfectly complimented the chicken. I doubt if this part of our course was authentic Chinese.

QUANTITY: LET ME WARN YOU HERE. THE QUANTITY IS MORE THAN FOR 2 PEOPLE. So you might have to end up packing your leftover food and taking it home.

BILL: We paid around Rs.550 for it all, which I feel is quite cheap compared to their quality and quantity of the dishes.

At the end of it all, we left the place with a full and happy tummy and a quiet "resolution" that we would be visiting this place again on another monsoon afternoon.

We used to visit this place from our college days. Whenever ¬†we went to chadni chawk we used to visit here. The place is situated just opposite of ¬†E-Mall . This is small joint ,only 18 tables are there . But the foods are delicious and service is prompt and reasonable priced . We used to start with veg manchou soup with mushroom(1:2) , then order rosted stir fried chicken which are deeply fried & fabulous taste . U can also order Lapchi kai chicken or pan fry fish for starter. For main course we used to order yellow curry rise/lee fu rice /banjara fried rice /sea food rice/crystal chimney fried rice ¬†and chicken /fish in crystal sauce or bell pepper chicken . All of them are good and quantity is for two persons.

If you are looking for authentic chinese without having a pinch on your pocket, this place is your ultimate destination! It is located just near to Chandni Chowk metro station opposite e-mall. Nothing to mention about the decor as it is a small place and you may feel cramped up but once you taste the food you will realize its a hidden gem. :)

Now my favorite starter here is lapchikai chicken. Boneless juicy chicken strips served with bell pepper and spices...just yumm! This dish is a treat for your tastebuds and will leave you craving for more! Next there is always drums of heaven and true to its name quite heavenly. Next on my list is the singaporian noodles which they serve with prawn chips and thin crispy spread of omelet, garnishing at par with five star chinese restaurants. On the side dish i have tasted hunan chicken and kung pao chicken and both tasted quite authentic and true to their flavors.
So if you are a lover of chinese cuisine a visit to this place is a must!

A bit little on place. At first you may have to wait outside for the seats to be available.. But inside it's beautifully organised. We ordered four dishes. Each were superb. And the amount is more than enough. One plate of Hakka noodles may be served to two people easily. Service was great. On the negative side, we had to wait long for the food. Otherwise it was a great experience.

A bit little on place. At first you may have to wait outside for the seats to be available.. But inside it's beautifully organised. We ordered four dishes. Each were superb. And the amount is more than enough. One plate of Hakka noodles may be served to two people easily. Service was great. On the negative side, we had to wait long for the food. Otherwise it was a great experience.

After a lot of shopping I finally decided to have my lunch there.. 
I had Lapchi Kai Chicken and Crystal Chimney Special Fried Rice.. 
The food was just awesomely delicious.. The quantity of the food was also very good.. The service was also very fast..

It is a small joint with a couple of seats but trust me on this the food is just mind blowing..!
I had a great time there..

One of the best restaurants serving Chinese food in kolkata. Whenever I plan for having lunch together with my colleagues we drop in this place. Quantity & quality are really good. Apart from other delicious items,¬† you must try special thukpa, lee foo chicken & Korean rice.

Based on the reviews posted here, I expected very delicious food in the restaurant. I ordered Chicken Hakka noodles and Chicken Manchurian. Though the quantity was good and enough for two , I was disappointed with the taste of the noodles. Yeah, Manchurian tasted good but Hakka noodles was not up to mark, though there were lot of chicken pieces and other vegetables into it.¬†
Thank you.

The first time I went there I didnt think I could get up and fit in those chairs. The eating place is too small to accommodate 6 tables but the food quality just beats everything. One of the Best Chinese dishes I have ever had was here.  Only the dragon chicken was too much spicy and should not be tried for experimenting if you are not good with 'mirch'. A bit pocket heavy but again the food quality beats everything.

A hidden treasure i must say...do not go for its look...just go nd feel the taste of Chinese ...
i visited several times..tasted various type of foods...when ever i crossed near the chandni chowk...i took my step towards this restaurant ..
easy to locate...
in lunch hr some days i waited like more than 30min out side of the restaurant becoz of there accommodation ....only 18 people can sit at a time....
coming to the food tai pai kai chicken and lapchi kai chicken in starter just unbelievably tasty and spicy ...followed by veg fried rice,chicken fried rice, mixed noodles,american flavored chop suey,side dishes like everything s good...but i don't like the item Hunan chicken...
every time i have to parcel the foods because of their quantities ....
recently some f the items prices have been slightly raised...
enough for 2 persons....
nd hope to visit soon.... :-)

Crystal chimney
Location: exactly opposite to e-mall,easy to locate.
Inside the restaurant the stair is tricky 5 tables only but enough for 18 people.
Ambiance is simple with A.C. inside the restaurant the aroma of Chinese food was raising my appetite üòú
We ordered: 
*Lapchi kai chicken
*mixed noodles 
*half plate devils chicken
Food was served on time. Lapchi kai chicken was very good flesh of chicken coated with batter deep fried then tossed with onions and bell peppers and different sauces. Mixed noodles was good and the quantity my goodness enough for 3 I guess and the devils chicken was hot spicy but best was Lapchi kai chicken.
Price is reasonableüòâ. Our bill was only 667/-
We were not able to eat we had to parcel.üòâ
Lapchi kai chicken highly recommended....

Also, really inexpensive. U should totally hang out here if u want good food but are aren't willing to shell out too much money.

My office being at chandni chawk and all my fellow colleagues being foodies, and my office area being a foodie palace, we keep on trying new places. 

Crystal chimney has now become a home as we keep dropping in every month almost.

A small place with extremely limited seats, this place came as a superb food package n surprise.

Each and every item tasted till date has been good in terms of quantity & quality. One plate can be shared by three. That's the ratio and superb taste.

Definitely it's a recommended place for all to try.
Do not go by how it looks, the food is superb here so if anybody is near chandni chawk and wishes to try Chinese, crystal chimney is definitely a place to be in your list.

Small place, sitting area is on 1st floor, air conditioned, neat and clean, consists only 5 tables. Ordered mixed gravy chowmein and shanghai chicken. chowmein tasted good, had lots of veggies, chicken, shrimp, eggs, quantity suitable for only 2 persons. our disappointment was the shrimp in it wasn't fresh, had really bad smell. Shanghai chicken was good. then ordered Chicken steamed momo. It consists of 5 pieces of thick-skinned momo with a bowl of clear soup. Now we couldn't have the soup as it had fishy smell. when asked the staff said it was made of chicken stock. chicken stock smells fishy!!!!! we tried to have it mixed with sauces, but failed to eat. the good thing about this place is reasonable price.

This is one hell of a place!

We were out for a casual walk and stumbled out here. Decided to get in and wasn't highly impressed with the ten seater restaurant initially. The manager out here is really friendly and helped us choose the dishes. I can't express how good they cook. Needless to say that I am very happy with both their quality and quantity. The place is not even pricy and it's a hidden gem in real terms.

As it's not close to my place, I don't know when I will be around but definitely willing to dine back.

Enjoy your meal and so will I. ;)

Chandni Chowk area happens to be a place surrounded by office everywhere. And I'm sure almost every office person of this area is aware of this restaurant. However, I find their food moderately good taking taste and quality into consideration. If you are hungry, and looking for some Chinese food, you can give it a try. But wait time is pretty long and service is slow too.

Been at this place for a couple of times only for their famous Lepchi Kai which is undoubtedly one of the best dishes I ever came across. The staff is friendly and the food doesn't take a lot of time. The only thing that's bad is the very little space they have. Other than that, if you are looking for great Chinese food, you can sure hop in

Usually what we ordered there is:

crispy fish
chicken momo
lep chi kai chicken
thai red curry rice
shanghai chicken
dry chilly garlic chicken

quantity and quality both were good. We never faced any health issues as a regular customer. now in days we have plenty others chainese restro's in city but i truly missed this place.

Chances are high you are viewing this place just because Zomato recommends it as one of the hidden gems in the city. Well, Zomato isn't fooling you. This place is really superb and the food is cooked perhaps with a lot of care and also cooked right. Again the place is small. Sits only 10-12 people but again that shouldn't be a good enough reason to skip this hidden gem. I highly recommend their crispy chicken. Should try.

A tiny little Chinese restaurant just opposite E-mall in Chandni Chowk, Crystal Chimney is ¬†easy to miss it if you don't know it is there. The seating space is small, with just about 5 tables and seats around 20-30 people. But the food is absolutely delicious. I have been to this place a couple of times and it has never been a letdown. Coming to the food itself, the noodles are good and the rice is okayish. The "Crystal Chimney Special Noodles" is packed full of goodies and covered with a thin omelette. ¬†The chicken lollypops were coated in a deliciously sweet and sticky sauce although the inside was a tad undercooked. The mandarin fish was a disappointment, it tasted watery and insipid. But my biggest favourite of the place is their divine Lapchi kai chicken, huge pieces of chicken with a crispy batter coated in a delicious sticky sauce with a generous helping of spring onion and bell peppers is absolutely divine! It is an absolute must-try every time you visit this restaurant.The service was prompt and the prices are very decent. It is a must-visit for any Chinese-food lover who happens to be around the area.

This place is really small, is clean and has AC, wont fit more than 15 people at max, but serves some amazingly good food. 
The two of us had a prawn thupka, a half order of dry chili fish and a hot and sour soup. 
Orders were taken by a waiter who was really fast, effective and polite. Food came to us in around 15 minutes, piping hot and fresh. 
My soup was a bit too thick but very generous, thankfully the prawns were fresh.
Thukpa was well built, good (but not the best; The Blue Poppy tops there, reason being a stronger, more aromatic stock) and very generous and satisfying. One thing I noticed here was portions served, in half ones, are enough to serve as a single lunch. Order a full plate only if there are two people to eat it.
Chili fish had fresh, custard tender fish, in a spicy yet sweet sauce. Salt was a bit on the heavy side, nothing that couldn't be fixed by the chili in vinegar. 
Total bill came to ‚Çπ425, perfect for the value for money bit. 
Will definately be back here to eat more :)

Locating this place is not a tough job at all...its right beside the famous hotel called "anand" near chandni metro...do not get disheartened by the size of this restaurant, yeah it prety small.. But sometimes u know good things come in small packages...and this place is surely is one...I can easily put this place under hidden gems of Calcutta... There is no compromise in the quality or the quantity at this place....its one of my favourite places for Chinese eat outs...i'v tried many dishes and non of the items disappointed me...all were really tasty....buying a portion of noodles or rice and a side dish easily sufficient for 2 people...and u'd be full by the end of the meal...yes trust me...the quantity is way too much for the price .... And that is the best part... :)
There is this item called "lapchi Kai chicken" in their starters, it is my favourite....one of the best dish I ever tasted.....as of now I have no complains about this place....I highly recommend this joint...

This is a very very small joint just opposite e-mall. The ambience is not at all good. The service is decent. Most important food. Well, we had Thai fried chicken which was below average. It's taste resembled KFC fried wings, but came with a lemon. But then we ordered Crystal chimney special hakka noodles and Lepchi Kai chicken. I have to tell the quantity is huge. Quality. The noodles we decent but the le fu was great. Simple right mix of soya and tomato sauce. It is for a long time that I craved such a flavour. Presentation of the food was good. Overall it's a thumbs up for food. But the ambience and everything somehow brings it down. I would have rated somewhere between 3 and 3.5 but since not available, I went for the higher.

My second outing here and it gets even better than the first. Hence 0.5 increase in my rating. It had lived upto it's reputation both in quantity and quality. Tried out veg fried rice and lee fu chicken. The chicken was an excellent change from the regular schewan, manchurian, shanghai, hong kong, chilli chicken we have. Green curry type of chicken, not so much spicy not so less spicy. Fried rice was good with plenty of vegetables carrots, bell peppers. All in all reasonable and delicious.

Just yesterday a friend told me about this place, an old Chinese joint in the busy tech-para of Kolkata....and recommended me to try their momo.... I gave it a go...the fried momo was as good as any but the-steamed ones lacked that zing...I hate thick skinned momos I guess....I ordered the shrimp balls next....and was disappointed again by the excessive batter used to cover the shrimp unnecessarily masking the true flavour of the shrimps...I wl make a comeback to  try their other dishes...in hopes of getting a better culinary experience than today.

Crystal chimney .. Oh boy !! This is one worthy restaurant to be in the hidden gems section . This review is a little late because I had the food back in August but trust me I still remember every bit if it and etching to go there ever since . We were 2 guys and had only 2 dishes . The Tai pai kai chicken for starters and the mixed gravy noodles for main course !! The starter had 8 generous chicken pieces and were really very very tasty . It was too much for ur really and the gravy noodles was yummy once again one dish is too much sufficient for 2 guys . hence I would say this place is a value for money and taste . For under 400 rupees we had 2 fabulous dishes and our tummies were more than full . I will certainly go back again for the other dishes like their fried rice . And I urge others to come here too. It is located opposite to the e-mall at CR avenue . Hurry super Chinese lovers !!

Wow !! This place reminds me of a lot of memories as during my initial days of college I visited this place quiet often and always ended up ordering the sweet corn soup and crispy chilli babycorn and also I used to dig in to some Chicken gravy noodles which always lived up to the expectations every time I visited this restaurant , well now the prices are gone up as I can see in the menu list compared to what it was 3 to 4 years back but its worth a try for sure better than going to some mall food court and getting chinese combos of 300 bucks each and get rubbish taste in your plate so invest your money in the right place which is restaurants like Chrystal Chimney ;) .

Regular visitor. Pointers:
1. Ambience very substandard. Sit. Eat. Go.
2. Service pretty slow. Keep 40minutes at hand
3. Menu variety outstanding. What's better, every thing is always available.
4. Every dish tastes different and 100 percent authentic. Try anything, you will love it
4. Must have: Thai Green curry with rice other than any Chinese dish

The little one that has a big impact! I had been here before quite some back, but this time I tried out something different and it was so amazing that I will get back to this place very soon. It was the Roasted Chicken legs with bell pepper sauce. It was juicy and tasty beyond our expectations! People visiting this place, please don't miss out on this dish. We also ordered chilli garlic fried rice and devils chicken but just couldn't stop thinking about the starter.

As the saying goes, "surprises come in small packages", this restaurant is a perfect example of the saying. One of the best Chinese food available in the city. It is better to take away from here, rather than enjoying their dine-in facilities, in the clumsily kept 4-table restaurant. Nonetheless, it truly is a hidden gem. The must try is the "lap chi kai" chicken which gives sufficient amount for 3 people. Try to stick to their dry items, rather than the gravy options, or better still mention clearly while ordering, to keep little to no gravy, as they need to buck up big time on that front.

Woohoo! Don't they say, better late than never? Well I found this restaurant rather. Later than everyone else did but find I did! It straight away goes to my cartel of best chinese in town‚Äì only a hanful have made it. One must visit this place if their looking for some kickass chinese and some awesome hospitality. Not at all a big place, a small sub-ceiling seating area above the kitchen with just 4 tables to fit in I guess 12 people at most. A humble place, yet serves chinese with pride and how! 
On my visit, it so happened that the spicy honey chicken was beyond sweet, and we sorta hesitantly asked told the waiter, you know just complaining but much to our surprise he was kind enough to take it back to the kitchen and make it better if not as good as it actually should be, but the gesture counts big time. Most places the servers just make faces and say nothing can be done. And I personally give a lot of points to hospitality, and this place scores both on food and hospitality. 
Also given the price bracket they fall in, it is truly an amazing place for chinese‚Äì gonna visit this place quite often I believe. Cheers!

This place is located just opposite the lic building in chandni chowk and is definitely worth being called a hidden gem. They serve lip-smacking Chinese delicacies and the service is very quick though the restaurant is very small! Do try the deep fried Thai chicken and the honey chicken, and the prices are quite moderate over here! Perfect place to grab a quick lunch!

This place was a surprise to me. Recommended by three fellow foodies Avradeep , Ankur and Tarun I knew it would be a safe bet. I had gone to Chandini Chowk for some work and decided to try a parcel from here ..... I ordered up the Crispy Chili Baby, Chicken with Hot Garlic Sauce and Egg Chicken Noodle. All three were good .... the baby corn was not as crisp as I hoped but that was no fault of the restaurant because I ate it an hour after my parcel. Both the Chicken and Hakka Noodles were very nice with big portions that two of us could not finish. Great bang for buck and taste .... recommended.

Really really awesome food but make no mistake about the pricing...you would think that it would cost very cheap because of the size of the restaurant itself but it isn't so...but on the happy side the quantity is humongous. We had brought in parcel with 700 bucks and we barely could finish the final piece. .Coming to quality it's exquisite even though it's HOT in chilli.u can request them otherwise
If u are a sober tooth DO NOT go for the cashew nut salad..u would be barely be able to breathe once u r finished with it. Try the uncommon names and y won't be disappointed. .We had lap chi kai chicken le fu chicken mixed meifoon
Advise : the place has small seating of 20 and is mostly a takeaway joint..call and order them before hand and then go in to pick it up..uncommon dishes take about 25 minutes.

Con : frankly giving a second thought makes me wonder why I can't go to hatari cause I will get better seating with the same quantity at same price..For me it's nearer and more readily available. .so choose your pick but I would suggest dropping in once..hatari may be branded for the day to day dishes but for specialities Crystal takes the place..

A tiny chinese restaurant with narrow spiral staircase to take you up.. with just 6 tables, it might get little congested.. however, coming to the food part, I always wanted to know why this place features under the category "Hidden Gems", so finally I visited this place today. Being extremely hungry after a gruesome gym session, i planned to directly order the main course, which consisted of Chicken Lap Chi Kai ( one of their specialities as suggested by my friends) and Mixed Noodles Gravy.. there were total 8 pieces of big, well-cooked chicken along with bell peppers in a spicy-tangy gravy which tasted pretty good. The noodles were decent too with loads of veggies, chicken, prawn, egg and the like. Quantity was very good as well. Will be back soon to try out their other dishes.

Crystal Chimney is just on the main road on Chandni Chowk and if u hv missed it you hv actually missed out on seriously delicious affordable Chinese food. This cosy restaurant serves u with a smile which is to be taken as a compensation for the long wait for the food. But when it arrives it certainly is worth the wait. Try their special non-veg gravy chowmein and chicken with green and red pepper. Their momos and wantons are worth writing back home. Visit them once and u r as good as addicted. :-)

Whoa, this one did shock us!¬†Located opposite the e-mall in Chandni Chowk area, the place is hardly impressive from the outside. No wonder it is featured under the aptly titled and wonderfully helpful 'hidden gems' section.On entering the place you will come across a spiral staircase, which takes you to the first floor. The seating arrangements are minimal, there are just 5 tables with 4 chairs in each,so at a time it can accommodate only 20 people.¬†The person serving us was one of the nicest human being I have encountered in a restaurant. He suggested us to have :¬†1. Lap Chi Kai chicken - a kind of starter and main dish combo. There were 8 pieces of chicken, and the gravy tasted amazing. As for the chicken itself the pieces were large, like really large, and felt the right combination of crunchy and succulent.¬†2. Crystal Chimney special Pan fried noodles - This was another innovative dish. The noodles were pan fried (as the name suggests, duh! ) and in a gravy. Ample carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, mushrooms coupled with chicken and prawns made for tasty eating. And the whole noodles were covered by one large piece of thinly fried egg.¬†And quantity wise - 2 of us could not finish it.¬†The bill came at around 450, and that too because we had some of the foodExtremely cheap, huge quantities, great taste. What else can you ask for? A larger eating space may be. If I have to recommend one Chinese place in Kolkata, it has to be this.

Wow. It is indeed great to see Zomato having a "Hidden Gems" collection whereby this place aptly fits. Located right beside Anand restaurant right opposite e-mall, this place has a kitchen in the ground floor and a very limited seating capacity in the first. The place is a hidden gem, so things are little limited edition. I have been here twice and ordered the same thing, crispy chicken and chicken lollipop twice. Both the times, both the dishes were impeccably satisfying. This place serves very good food and is also easy on the pocket. Should not be given a miss specially to all the office going college students working in CA Firms in this area.

This is not your regular dinning zone... It's a quick eat out zone when you are bored of your office canteen's food. "Chindian" cuisine is definitely very tasty,  though can't assure the health benefits of the dishes. But a great way to celebrate your regular lunch in this very small food joint.  Try their chicken lollipop and lapchikai (claims to be their speciality)

This place reminds me of good old college days. Days where a quick chinese bite in the middle of a very hectic schedule would mean heaven. This place has never disappointed me when it comes to their food. It's mouth watering. Located at the heart of Calutta in the Central Area (Opposite to E- Mall/Chadni Chowk Metro Station), this is a small place for people who want to have a taste of Desi Style Chinese at affordable prices. (Read students/youngsters). There is a small spiral staircase which leads us to their very limited seating area which has around 4-5 tables. One can often find people waiting outside this restaurant for a place. I have always tried their chinese and I love all the dishes I tried. Their Tai Pai Kai Chicken and Lapchi Kai Chicken/Prawn have a special place in my heart. I mostly keep going back for the same and often get it packed for parties or to simply have it with a mug of beer! The staff are well-mannered and the quantity of food has always been very consistent. Maybe they can work on their expansion plans someday! Highly recommened in the Central Calcutta Area.

Bon App√©tit! :)

The joint is situated in the heart of central Kolkata. I have tried almost everything from the menu. My all time fav being the Pan Fried Momos, Thupka, the Chimney Spcl noodles.

This is one gem of a place for easy on the pocket tasty scrumptious Chinese desi style! The food here is not authentic but it is soo tasty that you wouldnt care.
You reach the seating area after climbing a narrow spiral staircase. The seating is comfortable with the ac going full blast. There are only about 5 tables and the place oozes old world charm.
We ordered drums of heaven, veg fried rice, schezwan chicken and mandarin fish. The drums of heaven were nice and crispy with chunky chicken and the sauce it was served with was simply amazing! It was spicy and sweet and kept you coming back for more. The veg fried rice was decent. Loved the mandarin fish for its fresh sweetish flavour. The chicken was spicy and hot but simply irresistible. Loved the fact that the portions were generous and hardly any coating on them.
The service is prompt and attentive and the portions are extremely generous.

My friends and I had gone to emall in Chadni Chowk and after we finished our work there we had a Chinese food craving.This small joint located bang opposite emall and beside anand restaurant caught our attention.Hungry as we were,we decided to try it out without much hesitation and we ended up having a good experience.

This is an extremely small little place with around 4tables and seating arrangement for about 10-15people.There is air conditioning.There is nothing much to mention about ambiance and decor which are very basic.

The food menu is surprisingly extensive especially considering its a rather small joint.The three of us settled for a crispy chilli babycorn,chicken chowmein gravy,singapore noodles and a spicy honey chicken.The quality of all the dishes were quite nice.No one dish was really outstanding but then again none of the dishes had much to complain about.The quantity of the food was also impressive.The use of small chunks of babycorn in the crispy babycorn made the pieces crispier and tastier.I liked it.The singapore noodles was really tasty.The spicy honey chicken was as expected a bit different but a bit too sweet for our liking.Overall we enjoyed our meal.

The prices are pretty reasonable and even more so considering the quantity they serve up.The service is a little slow.But the staff are poilte and try their best to help out.

Overall this is a small place which is not that renowned but a place where I had a pretty nice time.

If you are a die hard Chinese food lover a like me, you should try this place for once. I love whatever this place serves. Trust me I have been to this place a lot of time & it has never disappointed me. If you are visiting for the first time, please try the barbeque chicken & special gravy noodles. You will never forget the taste. The quantity of every dish is enough to feed two persons' appetite. But please avoid visiting the place in a large group as it has a sitting arrangement for 18 guests at once & it is always crowded.

Amidst techno shops gives a nice opportunity to fill up your tummy. Compact resraurant with two floors. Ground floor is probably for takeaways. Nothing special about ambience. Food is good..but quantity is not very satisfactory, relative to other places.

My friends and I had gone to emall in Chadni Chowk and after we finished our work there we had a Chinese food craving.This small joint located bang opposite emall and beside anand restaurant caught our attention.Hungry as we were,we decided to try it out without much hesitation and we ended up having a good experience.

This is an extremely small little place with around 4tables and seating arrangement for about 10-15people.There is air conditioning.There is nothing much to mention about ambiance and decor which are very basic.

The food menu is surprisingly extensive especially considering its a rather small joint.The three of us settled for a crispy chilli babycorn,chicken chowmein gravy,singapore noodles and a spicy honey chicken.The quality of all the dishes were quite nice.No one dish was really outstanding but then again none of the dishes had much to complain about.The quantity of the food was also impressive.The use of small chunks of babycorn in the crispy babycorn made the pieces crispier and tastier.I liked it.The singapore noodles was really tasty.The spicy honey chicken was as expected a bit different but a bit too sweet for our liking.Overall we enjoyed our meal.

The prices are pretty reasonable and even more so considering the quantity they serve up.The service is a little slow.But the staff are poilte and try their best to help out.

Overall this is a small place which is not that renowned but a place where I had a pretty nice time.

A small and cramped dine-in place in the heart of Chandni Chowk, on CR Avenue (near metro station). Works better as a takeaway joint. A budget Chinese and Tibetan restaurant. ¬†One of our favourite places because of the close proximity from office, even if we have to wait for quite a while.

I like the chowmein, fried rice and momo (not much the sweet n sour sauce served with it) among mains. In chowmein and rice the quantity is good for one and a half persons with modest appetite. In sides it is the spicy and pungent Devil's Fish that's to my liking. Their thupka is also good. Chicken side dishes are decent. Prawn dishes are notches above ordinary.

The service is good.

this food joint has a creepy feeling from the outside but as soon as the first bite of food enters your mouth,, am sure this feeling vanishes .
The food is well cooked  and mouth watering.
The hun han chicken is the best.
The quantity of 1 plate is just about sufficient for 2 people.
The zomato menu card shows error as the prices are doubled in the original menu card.
Keep munching

Crystal Chimney has a small sitting area and its situated just opposite e-mall. It has only five tables. Though menu contains various kind of delicious items but simply ordered pan fried momo, szechwan chowmin and sweet & sour chicken. All items were very appetizing except sweet & sour chicken. It was too much saucey and sweet. Chicken momos were perfect soft & spicy. Hope to try remaining items soon :)

You shouldn't expect much in the decor and ambience. But the food quality and quantity is arguably the best.
The chicken lollypops, crispy chicken and diced chilli chicken are everyone's favourite. The quantity of Hakka noodles is just awesome for the price. My place to visit everytime i am in Chandni Chowk.

The food is only an attraction to this small restaurant else no ambience no proper sitting place just a small size outlet with sitting capacity not more than 5 tables.
Now i have tried chinese of various places but must say this chinese is just out of this world.
Amazing taste fair price and most remarkable thing about this small food outlet is that it keeps mentaining its taste and quality  
Menu cards is filled with items loads of variety to try for and all great in taste i have tried almost every single itmes except for seafoods one.
If you dont wish to step in with out family or friends in this chimney call them, place an order try its food at our home.
I am sure you will surely admire it . The food!!!!

If you are looking for a pocket friendly restaurant to fill up your empty stomach then you must give it a try! Though not spacious yet the food is tasty. We ordered lee fu noodles and lap chi Kai chicken. Both the dishes were delicious and was of large quantities. Price is affordable and good to go for main courses.

When you have to eat a bland meal at home, just browsing through the takeaway menu from this restaurant will help you finish it off in a jiffy!

Resembling a small takeaway joint, Crystal Chimney is quite easy to miss. Oppsite eMall, this small 18 seater resturant is a hidden gem when it comes to Chinese cuisine.

I have been here few times and every meal has reminded me how this tiny eatery can beat the s**t out of restaurants five times pricier than this. Be it taste, quantity, sheer variety of dishes or value - I can't remember any other joint which has fulfilled my expectations in such a manner. My best friend, who happens to be a connoisseur of food, quipped "this is the best chinese food I have ever had". It reinforced my belief that Crystal Chimney is indeed the real deal.

I love spicey dishes. Dragon Chicken and Lapchi Kai Chicken was superb. BBQ Chicken is a bit milder but is too good to miss. One word of caution though. Their portion sizes are huge and can easily be suitable for a couple. If you think about having a starter before going into a rice/noodles-main course, good luck finishing it. I have always came out of Crystal Chimney with an unfinished dish in hand so full marks to them for free packing.

A single person may need to share tables with others during busy times. Funnily enough, I have made a few friends when I was sharing a table with others. This restaurant has a friendly & educated clientale from neighbouring business district and it's nice to have an interesting chat whilst waiting for your food.

It loses half-of-a-point for seating and ambience. However, with food that good, I'll gladly stand on the foodpath and eat to my heart's content!

Roaming around the Chandni chowk for the electronic goods and suddenly if you want to eat Chinese food then this must be the restaurant you must visit. Located just opposite of the e-mall. They serve a good quality of Chinese food at a reasonable price. Went to this restaurant with my family and the place was not too spacious, ordered Pan fried chilli chicken, chicken Lollypop, Crystal Chimney special fried rice, Manchurian chicken. All the dishes were fresh and well cooked and the chicken were juicy and tender. To me the best dish were the Chicken Lollypop. The staff's were well behaved and very helpful. Overall a good restaurant to visit and highly recommend.

Location: Adjacent to Anand Restaurant, Chandni Chowk

Was around this area for work affairs along with a few of my colleagues. By the time we got over with our work, it was already past lunch time and we all were pretty hungry. One of the colleagues recommended this place as some weren't in the mood to eat South Indian at Anand.
On entrance, I could see this place to be a G+Mezzanine restaurant where the ground floor had the kitchen and the mezzanine had seating arrangements which could accommodate around an approximate of twenty heads. Being a mezzanine floor, the height is quite low.
Nothing great about the AMBIANCE, except the spiral stairs leading to the mezzanine floor. Quite steep, climb with care. :)

About the ORDER, I left the ordering part to my colleague who had recommended this place. The menu was a punch folder (could have been presented in a better way) having a widespread fare. The following was ordered:

- Fried Rice (Veg)
The rice was perfectly cooked and tossed with fresh veggies which were also parboiled to perfection. Was good to eat. 
Recommended.

- Veg Manchurian (Dry) [8 pieces]
The dumplings were nicely fried and weren't oily at all. Tossed along with soy sauce, spring onion and perfect seasoning, this dish was delicious!
Recommended.

- Chilli Garlic Noodles
The noodles were boiled to perfection and tossed with chopped red chillies and juicy veggies, but, the dish somewhat tasted a bit weird. Had a slightly sweet tinge to it.
A miss.

‚Ä¢ The quantity was quite generous.

The SERVICE was quick and the uniformed SERVER/STAFF was found to be polite who attended the customers with a cheerful smile.

‚Ä¢ Kitchen Hygiene should be taken care of a bit. 

A reasonably PRICED place.

A good place to visit.
- You'll surely have a nice experience, at least I did & hope you have it too. :)

As they say good things often come in small packages. Crystal Chimney is a quaint little restaurant right beside Anand Restaurant. Try out their crispy fried chicken momos or bar-b-que fish. And if you want something healthy on a cold winter evening, their delicious chicken thukpa!

Located adjacent to Anand Restaurant and opposite to Emall at Chadni Chawk , this small Chinese outlet is a gem. The space is extremely small and at one point , I could even listen to people whispering in the adjacent table. The food though is extraordinary. Every item we ordered were delicious , but one thing that felt like out of the planet was their BAR B Q CHICKEN. Seriously one should give it a try here . The amounts were ample and the pocket pinch was around Rs. 400 per head .

I just do not understand how I missed this one even though I am super chinese food freak. May be I generally avoid chandni chowk area, but that day I was super duper hungry and zomato was the only possible saviour. And I saw this 4.1 and I readily jumped in. The location is quite easy. Just opposite e mall. And there was this small little joint and you had to walk to the 1st floor. Though it was a weekend , I could see loads of people hovering round the pay desk,  waiting for their parcels. I could well imagine how crowded this would be during the office lunch hours. We ordered-
Crystal chimney
1. Lapchi kai chicken as the starters
2. Devils chicken
3. Tom chi mixed noodles

Possibly the best starters I have ever eaten. I think each one of us should try this in order to understand how well made this dish is. The devils chicken was also amazing. Simply loved it. The tom chi noodles was more on the spicy side. So it was difficult to keep pace with all the spicy thai dishes on the desk. We should have gone for cantonese noodles in order to suffice thr devil's chicken.  But it is amazing. And the bill was some 590. It was super decent. And we were three of us.the quantity was really huge. We were not able to finish it off. So do not order excess. The food is tasty and I am in love with it. I am going back for sure.

A small restaurant beside Chadni Chowk Metro,this restaurant offers delicious Chinese and Thai food.Ambiance-Nothing to joy about,an artificial first floor where you will find 4-5 tables in a small space and service is not up to the mark as i always find only one person to take the order and serve it as well.Food-the main highlight is the Food,for starters we have ordered Chicken lollypop and Dragon chicken,we found it well cooked and tasty.For starters we ordered Pan fry noodles,Singapore noodles and lee fu noodles.All the 3 dishes were incredible and the preparation was good too.For side dishes we have tried Devils chicken and Tampura chicken,though nothing to scare about,the Devils chicken not that spicy as it should be but the taste was good and we didn't like the Tampura chicken.
If you want a good chat with friends or your love ones over a good food,then this is the place,it is cheap and the food is good.Perfect combination

Inspite of stalwart Chinese resturaunts in Calcutta, I have been really really impressed by the food , the service dished out by this place. Chanced upon this place so many years back and the place seems to be the same even now.Every time I visit Calcutta,I do try and go to this place .Located bang opposite to E-Mall it is divided in 2 floors.The upper half being the dining area. A cover of 24 people makes it very small and quite cozy to have a dine out with friends. The menu is quite extensive and has a uniqueness in ¬†each dish we have tried.This marks it above of many resturaunts where most of the food tastes more or less the same.
The staff is pretty friendly and on asked explain the ingredients used and how it is on the palate.
Another great point is that ,it is very economically priced so you can have a Gooood meal and not burn a hole in the pocket :p.¬†As a student used to like it, now love it
The fare is extensive, we can go over and over and still find something new to try about :p
The place has not only great food but also great memories for me :)
Ideal for giving a treat to your friends without going off budget anytime. :p

Well, nothing to say about ambience but yeah, the environment is very much friendly and perfect place to chit chat with your besties without minding your pitch...
I had been there previously three times, but this time it was my turn to treat my friends and I chose Crystal Chimney.
We ordered Lee Fu Chicken Rice ( on owner insistence), Schezuan Chicken Noodles, Chicken Noodles, Shanghai Chicken and Lee Fu Chicken...I must thank the owner as Lee Fu Rice was awesome...a totally innovative dish with new pinch...I loved the food a lot... :) And my friends too loved the treat...
They provide good quantity...and lovely behaviour...A MUST VISIT BUDGET RESTAURANT with tongue-tickling chinese and tibatan cuisine...

After hours of pandal hopping around north kolkata on saptami morning we felt the urge to find a restaurant to dine in. Since we wanted to have chinese and north as per my knowledge does not provide with good options we decided to visit this place.The place is very conveniently located just beside the anand restaurant.¬†
The place was on my wishlist becoz of fellow zomatian's reviews. As the near by area does not have big puja pandals we expected the place to be less crowded but we found the opposit after visiting the spot. Since the place is small we had to wait.
Decor- It is a budget restaurant so plz do not expect any classy or fancy decoration. The place have 5 four sitter table and 1 two sitter table. All the tables are fixed to the walls so joining tables for a large group is not an option for a large group. Since we were seven in our group we had to sit in 2 seperate tables, which was big let down

Food- The menu is quite ellaborate but the option for Lamb and Pork is missing(another let down). We ordered 1 Pan Fry Chilli Fish, 1 Chicken Lollipop, 3 Special Fried Rice, 1 Devil Chicken, 1 Lemon Chicken. Taste, Quality and Quantity is very good. Pan Fry Fish was tender and well cooked with sauce and veggies, Chicken Lollipop was sweet and tangy and well decorated. Special fried rice came under a blanket of fired egg and 2 prawn chips, the other ingredients like veggies, chicken cubes, prawns, were in lot. Devil Chicken came in a red sauce and tasted good with large pieces of chicken. Lemon Chicken was sweet and lemony with big 8 chunks of juicy chicken.
Pros: Budget Friendly¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Good Quantity (1 plate enough for 2)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Good Quality
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Taste Good
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Helpful Staffs
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Prices are VAT included (Service Tax is there)
Cons: Small area
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†No table joining option (any group larger than 4, have to sit separate)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
Overview: Good place for a ecomonical, tasty bite of chinese with friends, family and partner. The management need to re-design the sitting arrangements to accomodate a table for large group.

This restaurant is located opposite to e mall and finding it should be no hassle. However one might have to wait outside to find a table as the tiny air conditioned room offers limited seating arrangements. A spiral stairway leads to the low ceilinged room which has five tables for visitors. Although there is nothing fancy about the decor of the place the food served is quite delicious. I'm not a fan of their fried rice however the noodles goes well with most of the side dishes. And that includes scores of dishes to choose from. This gives a great opportunity to experiment everytime one goes there. However my favourite is the lapchi kai chicken which i find absolutely delightful. The sevice is decent, servings are large enough and the price wont burn a hole in the pocket. However the few seating arrangements and the fact that one would probably have to wait a while before getting a table remains a downside.

A place which welcomes you for a budget buffet even being situated at the heart of the City. Though the place to dine is too short ( having the roof height not more than 6 feet ), but considering the convenient location, the quality and again considering the pocket pinch, it's really an enticing world for every passer-by. ¬†The menu is considerably loaded, and so are the items ( a single plate could serve more than 2persons), and surprisingly easy on stomach . ¬†The freshness in specially the ¬†fish items enriches the taste, which i bet is missing among the nearby big named one like Chung Hua, EU Chew or BAy Leaf.....¬†
Lastly, better to book tables by phone ( though the facility is not always available),on the sunday evening to avoid long waits.

Located in Chandni Chowk opposite EMall...this is a very small restaurant with about 15-20 ppl seating arrangement. I had been there with my friends on 10th of June 2014 and it was my first visit to this place.

This is not any fine dining or the kind of restaurants we usually visit but just a very ordinary one. Where the usual cost for two comes around ‚Çπ2000/- here it would be just ‚Çπ300/- to ‚Çπ500/- Nothing to say about the decor as its a very general one. But...you would certainly fall in love with the food here. 

For starters we had dry chilli chicken and for the main course we had fried rice and devil's chicken. Although the dish does not come well dressed but have an absolutely fabulous taste that you would crave to have again and again. Well behaved waiters and prompt service. 

Sometimes it feels nice to be in pocket friendly places like this.

So the next time you are around Chandni and thinking about food...drop in here. Nothing great about the ambience or feel but the food will surely soothe your soul.

Took my friend out for an early dinner to Crystal Chimney. It‚Äôs located opposite of E-mall close to Chandni Chowk Metro station. I had been here countless times before, since 2008. It has kitchen and takeaway counter on ground floor and small seating area on first floor. My friend had Pepper Chicken as starter and Lemon Chicken with Mix Mei Foon Noodle as main course. I had Lapchi Kai Chicken as starter and Bell Pepper Fish, with Double Egg Fried rice as main course. Everything was cooked just right and delicious; especially fish was not over done, as it sometimes can be. Lapchi Kai Chicken was neither too light nor too spicy, in one words it is extremely tasty. All the food was hot and very very good. All in all a delightful evening.

We went there twice.

first time , we took pepper garlic chicken , boneless fried chicken , mixed rice , sweet & sour chicken...... pepper garlic chicken was awesome.others were good enough...service was good.....waiters were informative....they can suggest you proper foods...

next time, we took pepper garlic chicken (again it was finger licking good) , drums of heaven (that time , it was the show stopper ) , mixed pepper garlic noodles (it was not good.small pieces of dried red pepper were irritating. ) , coriander chicken (very flat in taste.suggesting not to take it.).

they serves a lot of noodles in a plate. the pieces of chicken are big enough.It was pocket friendly too. Our bill was 630 + 92(tax & other charges ) in our second time visiting there.

A small joint where the decor and ambiance do not matter much as the food speaks on behalf of the place.. I like almost all the dishes here specially veg spring roll which I find is the best in kolkata.. Along with that coriander soup, talu mein soup , pan fried noodles and Szechuan fried rice are also my favourites .. Only area of improvement is the quantity which is quite less seeing the price they charge ...

The idiom "Big things come in small packages" is a very apt one when considering this eatery. It is located just bang opposite e-mall at C.R.Avenue. Its strategic location makes them busy throughout the day. The place is very small. Seating arrangements are very tight and you might feel cramped for space. The ambiance is ordinary nothing to write about. 
For me the most important thing is the food which is awesome in this case. And this is the sole reason why I always have overlooked its flaws. Yes now to the most important thing "The food". I basically don't love to try out the main courses when I find enough options which would cater to the snacks part or the starters. Bar-b-q fish is a must try. Eight fillets of fish tossed in a red spicy sauce and bell pepper and onions. Its a super bliss. The quantity at that price is awesome. The pieces are huge. Now to my favorite dish is the chicken lollipop. You can't beat this dish. Eight pieces of chicken again tossed up in a red spicy sauce. The taste is brilliant. The spicy hot flavor is so delectable that this place would be visited over and over again. 
The waiters are really courteous and have proper knowledge about what they are serving. To sum up all the things together this place is brilliant as it serves quality food at pocket-friendly prices.

This place situated at Chandni Chowk is not too spacious but the food is really good and is surely worth a try. One of my friends introduced me to this place few months back. The food we ordered was Chicken Drumstick and Chicken Lollypop. Both of the dishes were too good and tasted heavenly.

The only chinese restaurant in kolkata which can give a good competition to biggies like Barbq, mainland china etc. Paneer chilly dry, hakka noodles, manchow soup and the world best crystal chimney special thuppa. Love the Thuppa, give a try. Been there like  more than 50 times. My first experience started from 2007 and still going on. Definitely worth going.

If you are OK for takeaway food, you must absolutely give this joint a try. The seating area is quite small and not good for a big party. But the food is awesome. Trust me - when you look at it, it doesn't look like much. But at prices that won't burn a hole in your pocket, pack a bag and check it out. You would thank your stars that you found it.

Crystal Chimney is a small eatery and big takeaway destination on central avenue opposite e-mall. This small patch from ganesh chandra avenue crossing to coffee house sums up my whole eating options in chandni area with mission cafe, madras restaurant, crystal chimney and anand restaurant all coming one after one in a walk of just 2 mins.

It has kitchen and a takeaway counter on ground floor and a small seating area on first floor which seems like an eat and run zone to me but my main interest in this place lies with the takeaway. One should note that they take 30 mins atleast to prepare a takeaway order mainly because of a good rush. I have ate at the restaurant only once and the staff were quite polite and warm. But while taking an order for takeaway, they always seem to be in a hurry.

The vegetarian dishes or starters are all priced at around 100-120 bucks with pretty generous servings. If your office is nearby or you are eating there itself, i would definitely suggest a chinese salad otherwise it would get soggy after a while. Crispy chilli babycorn is pretty good too. Fried rice and hakka noodles are decent with side dishes prepared pretty well. I prefer their hot garlic sauce over others for the side dish and the vegetables therein could be chosen from a pretty wide variety.

Its an eat your heart out without worrying about your pocket destination for chinese takeaways for me falling in the lineage of buzz, kings grill. Though an impractical suggestion for a food joint in that area, but would love to see them start delivering at home/ offices!!!

If you are looking for authentic chinese or thai food at reasonable price‚Ä¶.Crystal Chimney is the place to be. Since I tasted the food here, I have become a regular visitor here.  Even for a vegetarian like me there are plenty of options in the menu. To name a few Chimney Special Veg Noodle, Crispy Chilly babycorn and  American chopsuey are really delicious and mouth watering. Servings are plentiful and quality of food is really awesome.

The only drawback I would say is the limited seating capacity. During peak time you might have to wait for quite some time.  But as they say ‚ÄúGood things always come in small packages‚Äù. There is still lot of scope to improve the ambiance and quality of service.

All in all‚Ä¶..Great Value for Money !!!

I came to know of this place from my friends who used to go there every year after the mandatory pandal hopping. so with a good word put in by my friend I went there. the place is not too spacious kinda like eateries are in the office "paras" with a ground floor non-air-conditioned and a mezzanine floor that is air-conditioned. the food is not out of the world but is good enough for the amount they charge. though one thing that stands out is the crispy chilli chicken. if ever in the area hunting for computer peripherals make sure to drop in and am sure you will leave satisfied.

Located very close to the Chandni metro station.
Gives you ample food for your money. You can not complain about the quantity or the quality.
The Thuppa and momos are amongst the best I have had in Kolkata. The chicken preparations are also tasty, as per your recommendation. 
Seating arrangements for about 20 people in a cramped up room. If the room gets full you can hardly hear the voice of the person sitting on the other side of the table. Not recommended if you are on a date and want privacy.

i ordered some take away food from crystal chimney since my domestic help did not come in to work and i can tell u i was quite disappointed with the crystal chimney food. the mixed chowmein and fried rice was not up to the mark at all. there was too much achinomoto in it. do agree it is for taste but for chidren this chowmein is not recommendable. more so the chowmein had zero taste inspite of the achinomot which poisionous for the stomach and foodies shud be careful that achinimoto in chinese food is dangerous and leads to cancer... if u compare it to other top chinese joints in kolkata it needs more improvement certainly.  there take away food is not recommended at all. if u wish to eat at the restaurant well i guess their   food might be a little better. but i think this place has been overated if u ask me. totally unfit for foodies.  trust me i have been invited to taste food at the opening of many restaurants and five star restaurants of my friends  in not only in kolkata but in  malaga spain as well so know the taste of good chinese food. the foodie is not about the taste of good foodie but many other things in the preparation and the other components that make up a good foodie.

On Central Avenue, very close to the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, this rather modest eatery is cheap and it serves good food. I have been here with friends a couple of times and the food was excellent both times. Dont be put off by the lack of glamour or by the cramped seating, this place never disappoints and that is probably a reason for obtaining such a high rating. For starters, I love the Crispy Chicken and the Crispy Chilli Potato. I have tried the rice as the main course and it suffices in quantity and tastes great. The Garlic Chicken is also a hit. The only problem seems to be that the last time I went here was a good two years back and the last few times I went to Chandni Chowk, I found this place to be closed. I hope it was just mere coincidence.

One of the best Chinese in town. Conveniently located just over the chandni chwak Metro Station. Next  to Anand (The grate south Indian restaurant) and opposite to E-Mall. Worth to try are: Red piper chicken, Lee fu chicken and American copse.Although all the items on there menu are very good. 
Friendly staffs adds to the charm.

WELL PREPARED FOOD @ CRYSTAL CHIMNEY!

Crystal Chimney - in the Chandni Chowk area - is a small Chinese restaurant that serves scrumptious and quality food at moderate prices. The restaurant is not difficult to locate. The restaurant suffers from lack of space but the sitting arrangements are comfy enough for a meal there. The servers are helpful and informative. The food is served without any kind of delay.  They have an exhaustive and extensive menu. All the items in their very long menu are available. For certain dishes, they even let you know the amount of time they will require to prepare them.  

Their starters (both veg and non veg) are the perfect way to start your tryst with Chinese food here. Their starters like pepper chicken and chicken lollipops can be compared to those served at high end restaurants. Even their chicken Momos (whether pan fried, fried or steamed - we tried them all!) are delectable and finger licking food delights. Among the soups, their chicken sweet corn soup and chicken hot and sour soup were well prepared and flavorful. The sweet corn soup was sweet to taste with generous amount of corn and chicken pieces. The hot and sour soup was mildly hot and well seasoned.  Their fried rice and noodle dishes make for equally well turned out fare. The quantity of rice and noodle per plate is overwhelming and are available in a variety of cooking styles like Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong style and more. These can be had with any of their meat side dishes. The house bestsellers are essentially chicken dishes like chilli chicken, hot garlic chicken, pepper chicken and so on. They are well cooked have strong flavor and are aromatic. Definitely good value for money if you are in Central Kolkata.

The quest for an exclusively Chinese restaurant without much stress in your pocket ends here,finally..When my starter (Chicken 65) came I gave the first bite with some hesitation,then the second with utter disbelief,it was not good .......IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!And then one by one I had chicken fried rice,pepper chicken, chicken with oyster sauce,all was great.The service was good..Although there was a little confusion during the entry as it was a busy time,and also there were no desert except cold drinks,The place is very small also..it was forgivable. And one thing I will strongly recommend,pls pls try the paan in the side-by stall....
