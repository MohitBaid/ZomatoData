Nice and cheap bar...that's it.
Food is okay.
Service is not upto the mark though.
Not a good choice for bringing family. The ambience is not that comfortable for girls.

This place is really good. May be one of the cheapest bar in the city. A pocket friendly place. Stuff are very friendly. Food quality is fine. I used to visit the place. The place hasn't changed.

The only watering hole in the Behala area, where you can have Alcohol and food.It is a rudimentary pub at its present form.
 Ajanta bar is a fully air conditioned bar situated at the ground floor of Ajanta cinema hall.The place is neat and clean, service is brisk and food primer ily tastes either sweet or spicy.The exact kind of taste that goes down well with alcohol.They have starters, Chinese and Indian Main Courses and some simple salads.Coctail or Moctails are not available. The variety in liqure stock is nothing to elaborate about, except the fact that they have a bigger variety in IMFL and herdly any OS.
The crowed here gets noisy on week end,though not rowdy, and till now it is an undeclared men only bar.

Drinks are low costs.. some dishes are really good. And yes that place is not for girls. Atmosphere is good. Service is ok ok.. but toilet is really bad. Good for frends. Not a family place to sit.
