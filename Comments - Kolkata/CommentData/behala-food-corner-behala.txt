Located on the right side of the lane opposite to behala thana, the speciality is mainly rolls and kebabs. The egg chicken roll tastes good and satisfies me with the filling.

Located right at the heart of Behala Thana, is a small fast food centre that fits in among the hustle bustle of the busy street. It is a local on-the-go food centre with no sitting arrangement and an open kitchen.

Strategically located, this place is a big hit for rolls and kebabs. Cheap food with fast service adds bonus points. Food here is decent, especially the rolls. Ideal place when you're running low on cash.

Very ordinary place with average food....just a place for rolls and stuff...the serious courses like biriyani or chaanp requires lots of improvement...

Stopped by many times for chicken and tikia rolls. The taste is average. Have taken biryani and chicken chap too, nothing extraordinary here. Recommended if you stop for a casual snack.

Happened to be in Behala for university exams and was hungry like hell after completion of the exam. Since my exam centre was located in a random lane off Diamond Harbour Road, this was the only descent option to have some quick snack.

This place is actually a small eatery located on the intersection of Banamali Naskar Road. Interiors look quite shabby and the menu is rather funny with 'Chiken' and 'Motton' and similar killer English.

I along with my friend, had a Chicken Roll which was prepared swiftly. The parantha used for making the roll was quite thick and pieces of chicken were also satisfying. Roll was served quite hot and tasted descent.

Hygiene wise not the best as they use old utensils but good thing is that they don't use a whole lot of oil. Pricing was standard and service was also good.
