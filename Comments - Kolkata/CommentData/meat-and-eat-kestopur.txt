Meat and Eat is the new feather of the crown of Kestopur. Foods of this eatery mimics kfc, however it has successsfully created an impression on its own. This review is based on three home delivery orders via swiggy. Thanks to swiggy for a timely delivery everytime. Once I have to call Meat and Eat, they were well behaved, atleast over phone. Regarding food, I have tried "ME Chicken Burger", "Chicken Cheese Burst Burger", "Classic Fried Chicken", "Fiery Indian Fried Chicken", "Hot Wings", "Chicken Popcorn", "Chicken Fries", "Chunky Chicken Biryani" and "Strawberry Milkshake". Burgers were really tasted good, good fillings, buns were soft and fresh. The fiery indian is not like the juicy and tangry fiery chicken found in kfc, rather, its a spicy version of classic fried chicken. Both tasted good to me. Hot wings and popcorn was below average, a not recommended product in my opinion. The chicken fries was a really unique product. It was fried chicken breast pieces, cut like french fries, served with a chutney, tasted awsome. Regarding biryani I can say that it did not tasted at all like any genre of biryani, rather it tasted like the Rice Bowl (formerly Rizo Rice) of kfc with the addition of chunky chicken piece and raita. The biryani came in a plastic sealed pack, where I noticed that the product was not fresh. On 16th August they served biryani of which manufacturing date was written 7th July (picture attached). However, the taste was enjoyable and I did not have any health issue after consuming it. The milkshake was also tasty.

Overall its a good resturant for trying kfc-like fried chicken and burgers in a pocket saving way. Highly recommended. üëç

Update on 5th seotember, 2017:
This restaurant is cheating their customer by serving old biryani. On 16th august, I received a biryani of which packaging date was 7th july, nearly one month old. Whenever I post the photo of the pachaking date of the biryani, its got deleted. i am again posting the photo. Dont eat their biryani. I have planned to lodge a complain in Consumer Forum against this shop regarding this biryani. I am reducing their rating to 1.0. Requesting again, please avoid the biryani and other foods of this shop.

The food isn't bad and the price is quite reasonable. They provide home delivery service, which is quite feasible and on time from my experience.

A small cozy place for an afternoon snack. Nice to visit with college friends and the like. The grilled chicken burger was yummy, nonetheless. A good experience. Not disappointed.

I have been there several times. Food is good w.r.t the price and ambience is quite nice for a casual get together. Staffs are polite and have a ready to help attitude. Overall I would say its a nice place for evening snacks..

Food is good but behaviour of the staffs are very bad! Ordered home delivery at first they took the order n said okk...but after several minutes of waiting they called n canceled my order...Only because they thought my home too far from their stall...besides the fact that it's only take 5-10 minutes by auto which is easily available. When I stated this fact to them on of their female worker said don't teach me I m a local here...as if she is doing some favour to me. Had a really bad experience...I don't know why even they took my order anyway they didn't deliver the food n I had to order from K.F.C.

New addition to the city... Varied menu offerings... Although a few are yet to start offering... Priced okay... Service is okay.... A bit slow for a fast food outlet.... Overall okay with this new brand....

It's a small eatery on the outskirts of the city (max 10 ppl can sit) - with NO tall promises. If you are lazy and looking for a quick hangout with 2-3 friends, this is the place to be. Food quality is average, ambiance is a notch higher considering other Kestopur locality eateries.

Needs a lots of improvements... 
Lack of freshness in products, the milkshakes are too sweet, the cola has more than enough ice, the burgers need updating in taste and flavour.. 
The French fries are stale with no crispness...

We have tasted chicken fries, chicken wrap, burger and fries. All are okayish and can be better.
The outlet had limited sitting arrangements.
