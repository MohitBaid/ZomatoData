Took passes for new year at myx on 31st dec 2017 , and had the worst experience of my life , the organisers were only interested in selling the tickets and mopping up the cash .The crowd consisted mostly of stags who pounced on the food and booze and pushing and shoving at own will , one guy tried to pick pocket my mobile ,and another was throwing wine in the air which spoiled my shirt . The new year party turned out to be a nightmare for me . And the fake apologies of the management on this platform does not serve the purpose . Wasted my money and time at this place.

Definitely one of the best clubs in Kolkata.
Amazing music and DJs.. Food and drinks are also not very expensive here. The best part of myx other than the music is the crowd which is safe and fun.
Overall a total thumbs up to the place!

Was a complimentary dinner from the manager. Visited this place for dinner few days back. I had a Virgin Mojito to start with followed by Chicken Steamed Momos and Chicken Fried Momos. I didn't like the steamed ones tasty but the fried ones were good. Then I had Golden Fried Prawns which was delicious. Under main course we had Chicken Fried Rice, Masala Kulcha, Chicken Pad Thai Noodles, Garlic Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. All of them were tasty. The noodles and the rice was in huge quantity. For desserts I had a Nolen Gurer ice cream which was good but I have had better.

The place is absolutely stunning, music will shake u before u even starts to dance.  I like the options that they have on the menu
And club looks so stunning and the manager who manages this place is so good with guest interactions.
Though the bouncers was the shit part of this places over all experience 
Keeping that not in my mind I am giving review

Location: Park Street Near Loreto House Beside KFC.

I visited MYX a few days back with my girl for a party and we were not at all disappointed, electric atmosphere,great music played by the DJ's.An amazing place to party.

Ambience and Dećor: The ambience is good,the moment you enter you cam see the bar which is quite large and it gives you a good feel,the decor is that of a particular discotheque.The main attraction is their sound system which is top class and it is an icing on the cake when the DJ plays really amazing tracks.

Food and Drinks:

Food:

The food is surprisingly good and not too expensive which is not  a common thing among pubs as they overcharge for food.We ordered:

Shawarma Wraps: Two wraps served along with a dip and fries,tasted really good and fresh.The fries were decent too and the best part it costed only Rs 200.

Drinks:

Bira Blonde: The beer was served chilled but the price was on the higher side but it is expected,myx being one of the hottest party spots in town.

Shisha: We opted for teen paan rose,the shisha was also decent not too strong.

Service: The service is good,the waiters are courteous and they were doing a pretty good job considering that it was a packed house.

Verdict: An amazing place to party with friends and amazing music,the pocket pinch is a little on the higher side but totally worth it.

I would have given minus rating unfortunately I can't !!pathetic place to hangout only because der is  no proper process for entry The Manager Mr Alam totally in sync with d theme of being cold no etiquettes at all !!

I had visited at Friday  wid bunch of my group all my friends easily got to enter and I was being escorted for no reason surprisingly I was not der being for d first tym  it was a numerous tym and so I knew well Mr Alam ,he was shitty stuck wid a bullshit sentence telling only members r allowed i was  der  regular bef4  ,ok blocking my way  he was doing his job as he said fy9 so my frnd coming after me she easily got entry as she mentioned her group is inside it was d same group us and   she was allowed so now wid wt d shit profession he was with !basically It was very  stupid and I m still very much confused wid his behaviour ,absolutely pathetic manager no respect flows in d staff 

He was outrightly rude ,uncourteous.This is probably most disappointing club in Kolkata according to d management 

 Even  after d food ,ambience ,drinks ,songs are too good ,Dj Sami no doubt he is superb hitting d floor bt management is ruining it   making a very gr8 effort to make is worst .

I m certainly not coming back  bcoz of reasons explained 

Thank you Mr Alam for an eye opening experience I have faced 

Senior must look after d matter very soon for further days coming ahead so d guest will not b harassed d way I was 

Myx only thing need to b improve is the management

The one stop solution for all genre of food and beverage cravings! Talking about the dicotheque what stood out here was the sound system installed! It literally makes one feel the punch of the beats! Opened in 2014 and is still ruling the roost. Amalgamation of edm and bollywood tracks is just the right mix. Pricing is done in a very reasonable manner.

I have been to this place gazillion times and it has never disappointed me. They serve sheesha too which is the icing on the cake. Brilliant setup , courteous staff and amazing music are the 3 main elements over here.

I would give this place a negative rating if I could. Had a horrible time at their New Year's Eve party. We were packed like sardines in that crowded place with barely any drinks and no food. Paid 3000 bucks for undoubtedly the worst evening of my life. Crowd was really bad. Avoid this place at any cost.

Went for the new year's party. 3k per person. At least 500 people against a capacity of 200. Beer over by 11. Drinks over by 11.30. Nothing to eat. Food to be served at 2am. Still they were admitting people and that too anyone who was willing to pay. Worst experience of my life. The girls with us had an even terrible experience. It's a personal request - Avoid this place

On confronting - its quickly deleted from the board and informed us that it was served to them by mistake. Now that's a joke. Still in the Myx for the night. Hope this is taken care of. Rating 3.5 only because of this, else deserved better rating. Feel discriminated. Thanks.

We had orderded some starters which were tasty and the cocktails were also made perfectly. The price is quite on the higher side but surely a must visit for all the party hoppers . :)

I really don't understand this place. I have tried to enter this place once on a very ordinary night (why did I mention that ? Read on) and wasn't allowed to enter. They said entry was allowed only for "VIPs and regulars" . So my question is , how will a new person enter if you won't let anyone in other than the regulars? If so you only want the same people to visit you every single time ? And being a regular Friday night, there was no reason to have said that. Pathetic place.

A crazy turn of events and every other places booked we decided to book MYX for our batch party, the package came with unlimited hookah,unlimited four types of starter and unlimited moctails. Fair enough. At first we had no option but to choose this place, but as the party kicked started we came out really satisfied. Though the hookah was not that good but the starters surprised us, rocking to the beat of dj MYX and sipping some upbeat moctails the experience was satisfactory.

How can your staff deny us entry on the grounds that its a private place for members only? I didnt get a good response on asking the criteria fr being a member. It was not like we were stags or so, we were a group of decent professionals. Atleast have the courtesy of qouting a correct reason before denying entry.

We went to Myx yesterday, not by choice but by compulsion. As Roxy and Tantra both had an utterly creepy crowd, accompanied by bad music and confused bartenders, we just had to try out another option.

So finally, we decided to try Myx, and I am so so happy that we did. A comparatively younger but decent crowd made this a much comfortable choice for us girls, to party. 

Will surely go back to this place, on many Saturday nights to come.

Despite the fact that Myx has a space crunch, it is one of the better clubs in Kolkata. I came here for a private party and liked the place. I loved the thin crust vegetarian pizzas as well as the vegetarian and non-vegetarian starters. The alcohol in Myx is of good quality and the variety is attractive as well. Do check out this place! It's actually good.

Myx, the new party place in town is a hit among the young crowd and the regular party goers.

Location: a few minutes walk from Park Street KFC. Myx is located on the fourth floor of the mentioned new hip building.

Food and drinks: food here is pretty good (3.5/5) and so are the drinks.

Music and ambience: music here is pretty pumped up. Ambience, vibrant. The crowd in Myx is more or less posh. There is social profiling, obviously.

Management: the service here is average.

Previously saurav's; this place is a rocking place to party with friends; yes they do crowdprofileing. We went there on a sunday night and it was overcrowded. The dance floor is small. Food and drinks were pretty decent. Still i feel there are better places in park street to party. Worth a visit though.

Please ignore the rating indicated here in zomato. I was here on 27th with my peeps and enjoyed a lot. The crowd was decent, a great place to party and dance hard, great music and 'decible', great ambience. I would have rated this place with a 5 if they had a little longer bar/club menu and some more variants of beer.

Excellent place. Excellent environment. The staff communication here is amazing. It's a two storeyed dance floor. One of the best parts of Myx is that they have a wide variety of food and drinks from where you can choose from. It's a must visit for party animals. The place is not expensive too.

It's the best night club in Kolkata. Drinks are cheap and also the decor is very nice music also is very nice. They should come with more shots and cocktails.

Horrible experience! !
The food is cold and beer warm. The bartender was a man of considerable skill who,if you can believe it, screwed up beer....bottled beer. Now you will agree that takes talant. I hope the beer gods make him boil in hot oil for this in the after life.
The dj refuses to play good music. "We don't play this music " he sais. This coming from a man whose job in life is to press play and then pause and then play again. Way to keep customers happy. This happened on a night where there was a private party.
They are riding what I like to call the new paint wave like shisha and cloud 9 did and look at them now. If you guys are reading think of the customer. Considering it's the customer who payed for your underpants it seems like the right thing to do lest you get caught with your pants down.
I was and am a regular party goer if you will and you can be sure never to see me there again...not even for a private party invitation.

the only reason for giving it 3 is becoz of the service they provide especially the guys whu stand down fore the entry , they dont have to right manner to talk to guest properly , it feels like they are paying us to get inside , which is seriously disgusting . apart from them everything was good , so would suggest you to plzz either change the concern person or do something about it .

Probably the Best Nightclub in Kolkata
Great music Awesome Ambience
The Staff is really professional and the behavior is very Polite, Strict Profiling is done,The Dance Floor and Interiors gives a really Good Vibe about the Place,the food is Great and the Cocktails are the best part, they have taken FnB in kolkata to a whole new level.
But in Public Events it can get a bit cheesy the only thing they need to work on.

Visited the place for a Birthday celebration of our friend. Keep urself awake or you will be overcharged. Very unprofessional staff who try to make money giving sh**** reasons. We entered the club without any cover charges or anything. But once inside staff asking for cover charges which was not told by the person who was manning the entrance. Later we asked for cake stand on which one of the employee told us that its chargeable but winked on saying he is giving it for free. So much thankful to that employee ;). Uploaded pix of that cake stand ;) and also the empty floor. At the time final bill settlement we found they charged us for 2 whiskey which we never took. It took them around 30 mins to rectified the bill. 
A worthless place to visit. People who want to burn money they will surely have different view. Again check your bill before making payments.

Firstly I DO NOT UNDERSTAND how come this place has low ratings...Its really weird because hands down MYX is one of the best places in the party circuit of the city and easily in the top ranking clubs.

Yes it does,crowd profileling  which is very much needed and that is the very reason they have a real classy crowd coming in. 

As per the staff and service they are very friendly and professional,bartenders are apt with their work and with a magnificent dance floor once has ample space to let yourself go crazy,Music wise it will surely enthrall you,a few days back only I was there and the place was packed to the hilt. The djs are real good.  One of my THE FAV PLACES FOR CLUBBING AND A MUST VISIT FOR ALL THE PART PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE A REAL GOOD EXPERIENCE.

It's so sad that a place like MYX has only a 3.3 Rating. That's below average than most places in Park Street. 

This place is definitely way above average!The Bartenders are really friendly, quite fast for the amount of people they cater to on the weekends. The food is quite fine.  
The dance floor and the ambiance on a weekend is simply electrifying. It is the place to be in the city. The sound system is powerful, well tuned and perfect. 

Those who have rated it 1 or 2 are the ones who do not cut the profile and refused at the door. 
So for me it's a great place!

It was our office party..& we had fun. But I faced a problem----In spite of asking twice for the starters to get refilled , it remained empty & finally after a hour we were told that dinner has been served and if we could just avoid the starters! !

However it forever too crowded and has too long a line to my liking
Can surely try a couple of times but as of now it stands on the top position as far as clubs in town are concerned, maybe at par with nocturne 
But personally, wouldn't venture into it over weekends 
Has two levels

I visted this place for lunch..as I am a chinees lover I visited the chinese section.This place has 6 floors one for continental chinese indian lounge etc.
The ambiance of the restaurant is very soothing a very soft music is played and it's well lit wth full chinese painting and lights which ads to the full mood...
We ordered hot and aour soup which is my favourite and it was quiet good and dumbsin(momo) which was served with a very nice brocoli sald it was eekdam chinese.
Schweswan rice was okay as it was a bot dry bt was quiet normal..
They also serve alcohol which is nice to hopp in for.
The restaurant is on a bit expensive side so that need to be looked into...

Myx used to be a decent club before tonight. Aside from the fact that the drinks are overpriced, my main problem with the place is the staff. Everyone from the bouncers to the management treat the clients with utmost disrespect. They make up rules on the spot to make small amounts of money, and behave like the clients are inferior to them. Cal is a small place and the myx management need to realize that cal is a small place and if their behaviour continues, they will gradually lose their clientele because of their attitude problems. Myx is a part of the "hospitality" industry but they don't seem to know even half of what that means.

My friends had come down from Bombay and Delhi and i had thought I would take them to myx.. At the entrance Mr abhijeet was screening apparently and had allowed me and not my friends stating that they are not regulars.... On stopping we told him that these people have come from different places and his reaction to this was (they are not regulars) ... How can someone be a regular to the club if you live in a different city,? Does this mean that even if you are here to visit Kolkata you have to be a regular at the club to get in? It is not only disrespectful but also idiotic to say something of that sorts.. I suggest your management should either mend his attitude or look for a replacement..

Never seen such behaviour in such a industry. Inspite of paying whatever they asked for they did not let us enter even after confirming that they would let us enter. Why such commitment when u don't allow. Not worth going or recommending anyone.

If you have a plan, with some of your best friends... and you want to intentionally ruin it. 
Bingo! you are right...MYX is the place....
I had such a bad experience in "Hospitality" from MYX, it scarred my "Party Mind" forever.

We were 4 couples and the manager rudely said he can just allow entry for 3 couple (with a whole lot of air of pseudo sympathy in his attitude". When i asked why 3 and not 4? 
He bluntly replied " Since all the regulars are there in the club... and i cannot see any regular in your group"...
 Now wait a minute ... I replied back " There is always a first time right?" and there was that blunt look on his face again.
The weird part was we called up MYX before coming and they confirmed that we will be well received. But the manager denied any kind of such commitment.

Anyways.... the entire episode left a bad taste.....

Nice place to go if you like loud music and ready to wrestle you way to the bar every time you need a drink.
Entry is an issue if u not a regular or with someone who is a regular.
The only way to be a regular is ....................................
Be there on time if u plan to be seated , parking is an issue.
Decent DJ.
Best to go on a Friday where it decently crowded and the whole environment seems calm unlike regular Saturdays.
Good ambience
Good Food and Hookah

If in Calcutta , must try.

For some reason people who run 'fancy' places forget that they are actually a part of hospitality industry. Only if they knew what that word meant! Am planning my bachelors and had called up DJ Vicky who happens to also be one of the owners. The first question he asks me about the party is whether the party would have a 'regular club' crowd. Now my first reaction was what is he exactly trying to ask ? He reasoned that they want to maintain the standard of the place. Now I wasn't sure that he was trying to be rude or was that just unintentional. Either way at that moment I was clear that I cannot host a party with such narrow minded and extremely shameless management. The club has a good vibe and a decent reputation but then again its treading the wrong path.

Let me first state that i have been to this place numerous times to party late at night but i guess that cannot qualify to be reviewed upon cos its just partying and drinking and not really availing ALL the services this place offers.

So i went to this place on 13th June 2015 with the intention  of going to OTT (their hookah lounge) on the 6th floor. It was a college reunion so there were about 10 of us. It was raining that evening so the "management" told us to go MYX which is on the 5th floor as services had been shifted there. Coming to the management, they are the most obnoxious bunch of monkeys you will ever meet in your life. They stared at us from top to bottom as if they were judging us and then very rudely asked us to keep our bags and helmets at the reception (note- people carrying bags and helmets can have more more money than you can ever imagine) 

So then he allows us to go upstairs after a lot of discussions as to how they allow only "members" and "regulars". I know the owners are trying to make this an EXCLUSIVE place but trust me guys, considering the idiots you have hired to run the place it will be known all over the world in its exclusivity of dumbness and deluded behaviour.

So we went upstairs and sat in the mezzanine floor above the main  nightclub. The waiter gets us a menu card all torn up and held together by cellotape (wonder what the "members" think of that). Drinkers amongst us ordered pints of Buds all around. One person ordered Vodka with Cranberry juice which i can safely say i would forgo anyday for a glass of benadryl. It was that bad. And the people amongst us who dont drink were left puzzled as nothing from the juice menu was available and half of the mocktails were not available either. 

The food was decent although they could increase the portions. We had ordered Crispy Babycorn and Jalapeno Poppers.(two items done to death in Cal).

Hookah was okay but here is the shocker, the waiters refused a coal change cos according to them and i quote "The price is only 200 sir. We dont believe that selling hookah at such a low cost warrants a coal change." Let me inform the owners that any kid in Calcutta can make a better hookah than yours for less than 100 bucks in his house. WE ARE NOT FOOLS. We know how much a packet of coal costs and an extra bit of coal would not ruin your exclusivity or upset the "members".

I have saved the best for last. In the middle of our ordeal i went downstairs to the main road to get a friend of mine who had never been to the place. While returning back i was stopped by the managers in the lobby again. This time there were two guys who were both again staring at us from top to bottom and both said we dont allow stags upstairs. Well, news flash buddy, you just allowed 8 stags to go upstairs an hour back! What a bunch of dumb imbeciles. They are not even from management school. I have no idea how your recruitment works?! Please have a look at the management in places around where you are situated. They are your competitors who you wanna out perform but with service and management like this the only place you will beat is the ATM round the corner. 

All the best guys :)

Anything new in Kolkata runs for a while but a must thought on the front desk staff is required by an Educated Entrepreneur. This place is new and is located in Park Street, Kolkata where Sourav's was established before with worse management staff at the front desk, looks like the establishment is established by some Rookie returned from some usual Management School, who has deployed some guyz from some slum area having a budget of  low  Salary basis, referred as the "Manager" stands in the gate hardly knows English language and behaves as the said " Myx " to be first and last choice for Consumers or Club Goers. This one goes out to the Management and the Lease holder of the said premises "if you are happy with some good income at your start up of your business then go alike as you are going or else try and change your front desk staff. Many came and went, the funda to try and stick for long should be the key to success.  The Guest should be your first priority. By keeping adamant and rude staff is your choice but THESE TACTICS TO PULL CROWD IS A VERY OLD GAME @ SAYING "WE ALLOW REGULARS" MOREOVER WHEN THE PERSON STATING THE SAME CANNOT EVEN PRONOUNCE "REGULARS" PROPERLY...Its just a tactic and tantrum to Prove yourself to be some extra in the line.. IF YOU WANT RECOGNITION MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS GIVE GOOD SERVICE, BE POLITE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU SHALL BE ALWAYS CHANTED ! ALSO STUDY THE NIGHT CLUB MARKET AS PER SALE IN CONCERN AS FROM THE START BUSINESS  TO 2 YEARS FROM THE LINE.

Chocking.
Food was ok ok typs but bill was horrible.
One hukkha n 1 crispy chilli baby corn with tax. They charged around 830. N yes they take extra for coal chnge .
I hv no prob with the amount, they charged but food should b good. Service vry damn slow. Staff dnt kw properly English, not hindi no Bengali. Being Bengali, they try to speak hindi which is nt clear . They cnt take order properly. Finally they cld manager to take my oder. Lol. this rely strange. Nvr faced such in a club.

Well.. We read all the praises about this place and decided to hop in on a Saturday night. Had the most horrible experience ever. The management person at the desk scanned us from top to bottom like we were some kind of fugitive then very rudely told us that we couldn't be let in as they only allow 'regulars' and 'members'. However, when we told them we would be there for an hour they let us in. The interior was below mediocre and it was completely empty at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night. Only two of the places were occupied. I want to know who are you to judge us by our clothes. We can judge you too and I must say the place was nothing great for such a big fuss. I  also want to know what kind of people do take membership in such a crappy place. Lastly, I want to know how do you manage to get any 'regulars' if you are such snobs in the first visit. I have been to many good clubs and 5 star places in Kolkata and other cities and never been welcomed with such shitty behavior. I must say Im never goin back to this place and would not recommend my friends or anybody reading this article to visit. Better go to any pub in the neighbourhood including the pubs at The Park.

Really disappointed with the management. After hearing good things about the joint went there on Saturday night with my wife but was stopped by a bouncer saying fridays and saturdays r only for members. It was utter bullshit as I could see people with known face just walking in. After  repeated queries it was said its the managers wish. Will never ever return to this place. This is how in Kolkata a new place creates a bad name for itself. Shame Myx. If the management do have guts please reply.

My favourite nightclub in Kolkata. I had visited Club Miami of J.W Marriott in Pune and the clubbing scene there blew my mind.MYX is exactly what you expect from a premium club. The crowd, music, service, lighting, DJ and everything that makes MYX is stellar in my opinion.A must visit place for everyone who wants to experience clubbing at the next level.

The story is pretty simple. I went to the Cafe on the 6th Floor on 21st February 2015 with male friend and we had pretty decent time. The food is tempting as well as the cocktails . The ambiance was cool enough for me. Now I again go to visit the place on Sunday 22nd Feb 2015 which was unfortunately my birthday with four guys and 2 ladies. The Lady on the entrance says that we don't allow stag entries. It was shocking going to cafe with couple i don't think so that make senses. The worst part is that the lady sounded very rude thats not all accepted. Even my friends had a small birthday cake with them may be the lady was blind enough or freaking clueless . It was great insult and situation of embarrassment for me especially as well my friends. Surely would avoid going to this clueless places and would try on to pass on such mind-blowing experience May be it doesn't make difference to myx and other  but some would surely agree to my experience. Thanks a lot

This place is right in the heart of City in main park street area. Opposite Petercat restaurant. It's a night club and presently one of the best in Kolkata. Recently they have won an award also. Decor is very nice and perfectly taken care of. Acoustic system is superb. Food again is simply great. Chefs are really working hard on it and it's clearly showing in their preparation. Perfect blend of taste. Overall a perfect place to hangout and unwind yourself.

Our friends hosted a party in chilli wok and I have no complaints regarding the food or drinks. The staff was courteous and attended to us well. Thereafter, we decided to go up to myx and the manager at the desk was very rude and he told us that "you need to be a regular to enter". How the hell do we become a regular if they behave in such an inappropriate manner and dont allow you to enter at all? This is the first nightclub in kolkata I have ever come across with such rude and disrespectful attitude. This needs immediate attention and should be looked into seriously. I give a rating of 4.5 stars for the food, ambience and drinks but a 1.5 stars for the attitude and the behaviour we received.

I really seek pleasure in writing the review  for myx.. I Guess  review is not all abt appreciating  the venue  but actually criticizing the major  shortcomings so that place  can improve further.  All excited to go to the place..i was really perplexed by the rude attitude of the manager. . I understand  u hv the pressure of handling crowd on busy days but professionalism  is managing  wotk pressure  by maintaining  ur dignity nd definitely  respecting  that of ur guests.. and secondly maintain some consistency as to wat u infrm  guests over  phne nd wat u say on the spot.  Thats it.. otherwise  food, hospitality  of staff, drinks everything is good.. just managers  need to  learn  how to tlk.  Thank  u.. hope if i by any chnace visit again see some  positive changes.. thank  u..:-)

While it would give me great pleasure to review The Myx on the basis of its food/alcohol offerings, I am sorry to state that one needs to at least be physically inside the club in order to have the pleasure of doing so. 

My friend and I were informed after much unnecessary waiting around, that the club only allowed "members".. upon a little prodding they admitted to having no such system, which left us feeling rather perplexed to say the least. Do you or do you not have a membership system, dear management? 
Might I also add that my friend and I were appropriately dressed and completely sober, something which cannot be said about the rather frightening crowd around the club. 

Clearly the management needs a little push in terms of customer service and communication, post-which I would be honored to visit this apparently cool establishment. Oh, and if your respectful (i.e. very very rowdy, women-unfriendly) "members" choose to vomit all over your floors, the least you could do is to have the mess cleaned in under 30 minutes.

The newest night club in the city...Myx has created a buzz among the party people of kolkata in hardly anytime,its done so because of the good management tactics and great advertising skills..the music system is great drinks are really nice hookah is average,service is slow and few of the staff dont listen to your instructions properly...food is pretty average..although i have not tried a lot of food here...
Overall a really nice place to visit with good sound quality and great music

Its the new happening disc and lounge in Kolkata which has created quite a buzz among the party animals of the city. Located at Park Street it is conveniently located and has all the arrangements one looks for in a disco. The day i visited was a Saturday and it was full house... i felt as if i stepped into a public bus where you are getting brushed by sweaty drunkards from all sides :p There was hardly any space to stand and all i could see is a plethora of men and women who were  dancing and boozing and enjoying the music. Could not stay there for long... tried a beer and just left the place in search of fresh air.

I had heard alot about this place. Some were positive while the rest was negative.
It was yesterday when I went to The Myx.
It has a great ambience and a good crowd too. It It has a larger crowd capacity than most of the nightclubs in kolkata and so it has a very good advantage. The only problem is that hookah is served only on the terrace and not inside the club. But the hookah was really good. It was smoky and smooth and didnt even cost too much. The DJ's killed the scene everytime they dropped the beat. 
Overall it was an amazing experience. Nice bieng there.

I give this a 3.5 because there were no crowds although we went at 8pm on a Tuesday. Of course Mocambo had a huge line. 

Decor: Very nice. Great choice of music as well.

Food: Alright. We had ordered Chilly Chicken and some Itlaian Dish that my friends chose. Both were alright to taste.
Drinks: Good. Overpriced. My first drink was a Sangrila and it was not something out of the world. The quantity was also less. I then ordered a Manhattan and was blown away as it was amazing. However, the quality of whisky could have been better. I did not ask what booze they had used but my guess is that it might have been Blenders pride. Not worth paying Rs 550 for either of these drinks. My friend ordered Mint Martini and which was good. However, her Strawberry something but it was so horrible I dont recall its name. It looked pink and tasted like cough syrup.

But I give it a 3.5 because it would be great when crowded and the drinks were good in general.

The MYX - Newest Disc cum Lounge in the Town.
==============
Location: Just next to park street KFC (earlier it was saurav's)  
==============
Intro: 

It is a newly opened lounge in the city of joy. As it's opened in the prime location, it is catering to a large crowd of youngsters and is also a class apart. When you reach there, it is situated inside a building on the 4th floor if i am not wrong. The disc is divided into two sections:

1) Below section is the dance floor with dj and the bartenders serving the drinks in the bar. Serves sheesha and food here too. Much noisy and crowded than the above section on saturdays. 

2) Above section comprises of more like a lounge type experience where the staffs are serving sheesha and food. (Along with bar)  

I had came here on my brother's birthday and to celebrate it, we had ordered a cake before hand at say, 11 pm so that by at least 12 we get the cake. However, due to the sheer negligence on the part of the management, the cake was delivered to us at around 12:30 which is not acceptable because it is a "Birthday" cake and "time" is very important with respect to such things. The second fault which i noticed is that i had been asking them for the sheesha from 11 p.m. and sheesha got delivered to me by 1 p.m. when i asked another staff for it. I was furious by that time but i relented. 
==============
Pros:

1) Prime location.
2) Lovely music.
3) Decent crowd.
4) A disc cum lounge
5) For the smokers, you can smoke openly here without going into the smoking room whatsoever as they don't have one. 

Cons:
1) As smoke is accumulated due to cigarette and sheesha, my eyes started to burn a lot like anything. I believe there should be something to minimise the excessive smoke like installing smoke filters. 
2) PATHETIC service. As it was a saturday night and my brothers birthday, i relented. Otherwise, "believe" me, i would not have left so easily. 
3) Hookah was TERRIBLE. It choked like crazy and me, my brother and a friend - all of our throats got into SERIOUS TROUBLE because of your staffs negligence in making the right sheesha. 
==============
Ordered:

Brain freezer Hookah - PATHETIC Hookah ever. Paid 400 bucks for it. Sheer waste of my money. 

Jager Meister Bomb - It was too good. It really made up my night. 
==============
Summary:

Ambience 4/5
Service/hospitality 1/5
Hookah 1/5
Value for money 3/5
==============
Conclusion: 

Please improve your services. I understand that you are a new club in Kolkata but however, DONT "burn" the throats of the customers by giving them pathetic hookah. Yes, delay in service is understandable but serving a Hookah so pathetic like that to a customer who usually takes hookah at many places isn't acceptable. The reason why i am giving 3 is just for the fact that the ambience was super awesome and the music was too good.
