Tried chokolae mastani and thandai. Both were just amazing. The consistency of ice cream is towards the softer side and it is just delicious to have without getting your teeth or tongue frozen to death. The pricing, though a bit towards the higher side, but seemed justified going by the quality of the ice cream.

Lovely natural's icecream( pune) with an array of flavours on offer. I tried the sitaphal option which was really good. After that i ordered for a tender coconut option which was even better. The person insisted me to go for the thick cold coffee which they prepare . Going by his word i went with the flow and trust me it was more of a floating thick cold coffee ice cream . A very unique experience at this place concluded with a twist in the tale. Chocolate pan was just off the hook . Highly recommended for everyone  seeking for great icecreams.

Gist : A must visit for anyone who eats ice cream. Has signature taste of ice cream. Less costly than other branded competitors.

I visited this place on 22.1.17 around 1.15PM. Easy to locate. A small place which also provides party orders. Only one plastic tool was available for seating, so standing is mostly probable (They can improve this by increasing or creating seating place). Ordered Mango, Mango Mastani and Brownie Chokolae Ice cream. The owner is very friendly. Serving time is excellent. It is great that they have their own taste (not just like another branded ice cream). They also serve ice cream in bit molten condition so its easy to eat, and chance of frozen tongue is minimum. Brownie Chokolae is a sizzler type item, molten Brownie and scoop on top of it. It tasted great and this place requires visit just for this item alone. Will visit again to eat other flavours.

"Chocolate Mastaani" a must try for all the chocolate lovers.A congested ambience but an amazing quality. Every flavor is so real. They'll let you try all their varieties happily. A Big thumbs up Eat-o-gito. Keep up the good work. :)

Came to this place post some shopping at Vardaan Market. It's located inside the same place at the gate on the side which leads you to Wood Street. They claim to have ice creams with natural flavours. Tried a few flavours for sampling like the Paan, Litchi, Alphonso Mango etc. Liked the mango to be the best. Hence took a small cup of that one. Flavours were pretty good and rich kind of. I have deducted points for the texture of the ice cream. They need to work a lot on it regarding all the flavours. The ice cream was freezing and the texture was too dilute. If this improved, rest will be fine. Happy Dining! :)

Chocolate mastani

The ice cream itself is delicious and it is from Pune
Ya the quantity is less but the quality is top notch.
Chocolate paan is like having chocolate in your mouth.
Its cold coffee is too good.

A very small eatery outside Vardaan Market which serves out of the world delicacies. Do stop here if you are in the area! I tried the ferrero shot and the chocolate paan. Both were delicious. Chocolate paan was really refreshing. To top it, the manager is very friendly and warm. 
We tasted some lip-smacking ice cream flavors - Guava, paan, Alphonso . Believe me, even if you have tried these flavors elsewhere, they are nothing compared to this place!
Will be coming back soon for more!
