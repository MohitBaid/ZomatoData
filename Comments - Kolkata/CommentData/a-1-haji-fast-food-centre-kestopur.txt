The place is a heaven for Mughal dishes. The price is affordable and the dishes are super tasty. I have tried most of their dishes but the best is chicken tangri butter masala and chicken bharta. Tandoor and kebab items are also good here. The biryani here is special. I would recommend to people in the vicinity area to try here once.

It's a new joint. Been at this take way couple of times. AFAIK there isn't a sitting arrangement. But the food is yummy, the quantity is more than enough. Here in Kestopur there isn't a ton of options someone gets. But this one currently is in my watch list. Not that costly and the service is prompt too. Don't know if it's  just a marketing gimmicks as this is a new joint but if they keep the ball rolling like this this will be one of the few joint here that everyone will keep in their mind.
