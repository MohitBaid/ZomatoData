Worst food ever. Paneer was tasteless whereas food looked stale. I highly recommend to stay away from this place. The manager was arrogant as well. When complained about the food, he just said this is how the food generally tastes like. Take it or leave it. Try the other restaurants nearby but do not ever step foot on this restaurant.
Ps. : I'm not the only customer to have had an issue like this here. You'll find customers complaining on a daily basis there.

Yday late night we visited the joint at about 1 am and it was fully stacked like anything. We managed to get our orders done and sat down. Firstly we had paneer tikka and babycorn which were good enough. Then we ordered Dal tadka, Aloo  pyaza, paneer tikka masala along with rooti n kulcha. The food wasn't anything wow but the service was prompt. Dal tadka was the show stopper which was really amazing.

This place is Just Opposite to the place I visited lately , this is a very good place and must try for all late night freaks. I tried paneer in main course along with rotis followed by some sweets. Over all experience was very good and recommended place. Try this place.

Though i didnt like veg food so much but their veg foods were tasty n yummy. Achari alu, Kashmiri aloor dum, jeera rice, veg polao - all were nicely cooked and served quickly. I liked achari aloo mostly.It was tangy ans spicy a little. This place is small but food was good and price was affordable too. and moreover it's near my work...

The place is owned by a former employee at Balwant Singh's and offers satisfying vegetarian food that is not too hard on the pocket. Probably even better than BSEH.

I don't think so i will ever return to this joint again. As we were settling down, there was some eerie smell, that engulfed the seats. We should have known then itself. 
Neither the food, nor the ambience was anything to review about.
We ordered Malai Kofta, Dal Makhani and Aloo Do Pyaaza, to go with the Butter Tandoori Roti. I have a strong feeling that all the food was cooked before.
By then we were so scared, that the Veg Biryani came in the table, only to be packed away to be given away to someone hungry on the road. We should have waited for his review. The only worthwhile food, was Papad. Enough said.

It's like a second option for those who cannot wait in line for their turn at Balwant Singh's Eating House. It has an AC seating on what appears like the mezzanine floor. We found a table there and ordered doodh cola, a signature drink that was invented by Balwant Singh's dhaba. I was told an ex employee has started Desi Cuisine. No wonder the Alu Dopiaza and tadka tasted almost like what I loved from the famed dhaba. I say almost like because nothing can match the taste of the original.
 The onion kulcha was also good and so was the dal khichdi. The tadka was yummy in my tummy in no time.

The owners are quite gracious and even if the seating area is totally packed, these guys will arrange seatings. Try the garma garam samosas and the namkin with mirchi, it goes well with my everyday chai. :) I come to this place every day.

And it is quite tasty as well. The best part is, I am a hardcore non-vegetarian and was forced to come here for my vegetarian friends, but not once did I feel like I want chicken. Great taste, amazing presentations and a courteous staff! Really enjoyed this place!and  chai is a asset of this place... if i go there i never come without drinking it.

Close competitor of over-hyped Dhaba, Balwant, and certainly provides better food. I have been there many times and had tried many items and everything is just average, (so you can imagine how Balwant's food wouble be). But the morning tea and snacks are really good infact better than Sharma's (located on the other side of the crossing).. many people with their friends and enjoy their morning tea here, u can spot me as well sometimes. ;)

Its actually a Dhaba style restaurant with amazing serving and very good food.Huge list to choose from and the taste reminded me of rajasthan style food- very delicious
. The restaurant is the right place if you are looking for value for money. The food is cooked in very good medium and has dishes like Methi Malai Curry , Samosa, Dal Makhani which are undoubtedly one of the best in the city. It does have a sitting area as well for a family outing but sitting in the car and having it outside or a take away is a great experience

Came here once when a t-20 match got washed out. The food is okayishh, nothing extraordinary. You can have doodh-cola here which is kind of famous in this road. But highlighting factor is the kulfis outside this outlet. He has some of the best kulfis especially the seetafal kulfi. While he is serving you, just have a chat with him on how he prepares it. 1 extra rating for kulfi itself.

I visited this restaurant for authentic north indian taste after a hectic Saturday working. The place is small and converted from a take away place to restaurant. Service is slow as there is only waiter. I ordered paneer tikka masala with tandoori roti and garlic naan. Apart from garlic naan, both things were fingerlicious. Don't visit with many friends or family as it is a small place but definitely worth visiting for its taste.

A outlet which serves desi food. They serve items like Dal Tarka to Panner Butter Masala which is on a good side. Quantity is good, quality is not that good. I had chilly paneer here which was very spicy. It should have been less spicy. Prices are reasonable.

This very afternoon I made a visit to this vegetarian joint serving north indian delicacies located on the opposite side of Balwant Singh's dhaba.The A/C restaurant is located upstairs of the restaurant is a small space that can accomodate no more than 20-25 people.The food pricing is on a steeper side,taste is above average.we went for peas pulao,kadhai paneer and a glass of sweet lassi.The quantity of paneer was stumptous but the rice was relatively less in amount.The lassi was served in a ' kulhar ',a.k.a earthen glass that made it look really cool.The service was prompt and staff cordial.The biggest plus point was as soon as we stepped from car,an employee came running asking for our orders which was really a nice gesture.overall a visit is recommended for all.
Happy Eating

With no offence to Balwant Singh Dhaba, as I m a regular visitor of the Dhaba for a Cup of tea, the Food at the DESI CUISINE is much better than the Dhaba Situated exactly at its opposite..hv been there many a times nd all the times the foods were equally good ! Thy  serve foods at the roadside nd also hv very little sitting arrangements at the upstairs..Can try out this place :)

It was after a session of badminton match that we friends decided to eat outside that night. We headed for this new place called Desi Cuisine which is just opposite to Balwant Singh Dhaba. I was a bit apprehensive about the food as i am a big fab of Balwant singh dhaba. My friends who had visited Desi Cuisine earlier convinced me to try out the food here... And i being the foodie thought of giving it a try once. Its a typical roadside food joint with seating arrangement on the footpath itself. Initial order was kesariya chai... And i swear i just loved it. The nip in the air mmade the tea drinking experience even better. We went ahead with ordering Makki roti and sarson da saag and yellow tadka daal. I must tell that both the items was very very tasty. The butter oozing on the makki rotis was too much too handle for my watering mouth :p For dessert we ordered gulab jamun which were served hot on a plate. The jamun melts in your mouth leaving the sweet effect to linger in your mouth for a long time. I loved the Food and service here. I shall be visiting Desi Cuisine again very soon.

My Best Friend Mohit who lives in that area suggested us that instead of our regular more popular joint lets try The CHAI SHAI at this humble joint. And trust me i was bowled over by the Kesaria Tea...... and since then i have pangs for those...They are the creamiest most well made milk tea adorned by saffron and they are just a specimen apart. I just love their food..specially their Dal Makhani, Bharwa Bhindi Ki Sabjee and Paneer Butter masala....in all its heaven for veggies.......

Dis honest behaviour. 
Very often I order takeaways and home deliveries from them as I liked their food very much but I never checked the bills.

Today I ordered for few dishes and while paying d bill felt the bill shud not have been the same as the counter boy asked for. He didn't even give me any bill and when I asked for a break up calculation and tallying it with the menu card, I found for every item he was charging me 15Rs extra, on asking the counter boy replied that the extra amount was for "special order" (extra buttering) but I told him that I never mentioned extra butter or "spcl" Term, to that he replied that I should mention it that I don't need spcl or extra buttering,  I further questioned him that even if he thought so that I m ordering the special one, but I never heard him instructing his kitchen boys mentioning "special"  or "extra butter"  as I could clearly recall. To this he said  nothing and just returned me back the extra amount.
This kind of dishonesty is really not expected.

Love the breakfast club kachori as well...In short a very desirable veg food joint..And if they mention the quality n quantity they have now,in years to come it will be a force to reckon in bhawanipur..No comparisons with balwant singh dhaba but desi cuisine is a brand of its own...

Situated just opposite Balwant Singh's on Harish Mukherjee Road is Desi Cuisine serving as the name suggests desi-vegetarian food. The last time we decided to go to Balwant Singh it was really crowded and we had a time constraint so we decided to give this place a shot.   Our order comprised of  Paneer Paratha , Dal Tadka and Alu Do Pyaza with Onion Salad . All the items were well prepared and served hot and fairly quickly , and we enjoyed our meal. On our way back home we drove past around midnight and it was still open. They also serve breakfast so I plan to try that out soon especially the Kachori , Samosa and Pakora's all washed down with garam Chai.

This would be the second review for Desi Cuisine and a revised rating of  4 :) 

I have ordered a number of times in the last couple of months. One night my mom wanted to have some food around 11 PM. Pizza was obviously not an option, so I suggested Desi Cuisine as it home delivers :) 
We ordered 2 Alu parathas, 1 Paneer Tikka and 1 Malai kofta. After some time my mom wanted to have some sweets as well and I found out that they have Gulab Jamun in the menu. When I called them again to add Gulab Jamun to the order, the person on the other side of the phone said that the delivery guy has already left with the order ! But then he said that he will call him back and include the Gulab Jamuns as well ! I really liked this gesture that too only for two Gulab Jamuns (Rs10 each) 
The order reached within 15 minutes in spite of such a confusion.  
The Paneer tikka was really yum. Charcoal grilled fresh and soft paneer was melt in the mouth good ! The accompanying grilled and spicy tomato and onions are a perfect combination. SImply loved this dish. The alu paratha was decent and the malai kofta tasted great as ever. 
The Gulab Jamuns were just average, nothing extra ordinary. Home delivery is free for orders over Rs200
.
I recently tried the chai there as well. It is really nice and affordable. and much better value for money compared to the neighboring Balwant Singh ! Balwant Singh really has a good competitor now!


----- 11 Sep, 2013 -----

This is a new Veg joint which has come up near the  Balwant Singh eating house on Harish Mukherjee Road and giving quite a stiff competition to the other dhabas near by. You can either choose to dine in or have it in your car parked just outside the restaurant. Recently they have also started Home delivery which is a plus over Balwant Singh. 

I have ordered twice, as take aways. The Alu Parathas are good and the potato stuffing is quite filling. The Butter Tandori Rotis are soft and tender. The Malai Kofta is too good stuffed with Paneer. You may also try the Matar gravy which is very good to taste. This place is appropriate for a late night dinner as it is open till 1 o clock at night. Quantity and Quality is well balanced and worth a visit. They also have a counter selling Tea. Have not tried it yet, but will be back soon to try the other veg delicacies. A 3.5 for this new kid in the block :)

Quality of rice was ordinary in steamed rice. In Aloo-do-pyaza, black spoiled potatoes were used. In lassi, khatta dahi was used. I got a refund on lassi though. Restaurant is cheap. Space does not look too hygienic. All in all average food for average money spent.

 Thanks to Pranab, Amit, Vicky, Bachu Bai, lalaji  & others,

The food was excellent all the way from starter,  chai and samasos to dali makhni & naan and gulab jamuan to name a few.

I would recommend all to visit and relish on the vegi delights.

4.0 Great Ratings - for Fresh quality food, pricing and courteous staff!
This joint on the opposite foot of Balwant Singh Dhaba, kudos to them for opening their outlet so near to a 'food fav''  place. We went there on Maha Chaturthi (8th Oct 2013) during Durga Puja after much pandal hopping and finally wanting to grab something to eat - at 1AM. As the restaurant was full, we made ourselves comfortable on the chairs outside the outlet and ordered the following:
Paneer Tikka (One) - Distinct charcoal flavour but was not marinated upto the mark. The manager was courteous and honest enough to explain that it was marinated just 5 minutes before our order was placed as all the Paneer Tikkas were exhausted. 
Aloo Tikka (One) - Generous Quantity with charcoal aroma, excellent!
Aloo Paratha (One) - Was soft with generous amount of melted butter on it 
Onion Paratha (One) - I recommend everyone to try this for sure, onions and masala created magic in the mouth, powerful flavours
Chai (Six) - I must confess that it was a much better tea compared to the nearby tea places though I have been a regular since ages at the nearby joints!
Cost - Rs 450 (incl taxes) for the above order, much lesser than what we had expected.
Pros: Generous quantities, almost every item served with green chutney, pocket friendly pricing, courteous staff and managers, great location!
Cons: Difficult parking, although they do manage few cars and bikes in front of their outlet. 
P.S. Way to go, Best wishes!
