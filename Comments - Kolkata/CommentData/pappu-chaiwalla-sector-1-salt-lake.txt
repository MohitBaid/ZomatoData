This place was on my try list for long, went in for breakfast, seating is orthodox, open area seating, loved that.
Ordered stuff and varieties of tea, but to my surprise no food was served even after half an hour, went in to enquire as to why people coming in after us have their orders and not us, to which they keep on ignoring. 

Staff needs training for sure, cleaning request was not attanded even after 4-5 calls and literally stopping the server. After 45 mins we were told that our order will take more time, more than half an hour at least, like seriously! We then complained and they severed us just tea, the adrak elaichi version of their tea. 

Coming to the tea that we could only try, it was creamy, not best but decent.

A good snack joint to make a visit to. With the scraps and printed milk container panel and seating arrangement it gives a very quirky ambience. The place is really small. But never the less they have the take away concept. Coming to the food i really loved jhaalmuri, cheese maggi, arabiata maggi, butter toast and chai. But lemon ice tea was pathetic i would never suggest anyone to go for lemon ice tea. Rather i would suggest you to go for cold coffee. As I am a vegetarian and they serve non veg also ... so having pyaazi there i felt they dont have separate oil for the two. Never the less when they were asked about it they told me on demand they keep the oils separated..so one who has such issues can keep oil factor in chck while ordering for the food
One thing which really got into my nerves was they took 30- 35 mins to get us our bill inspite of asking them 5-6 times.

The nearest cafe from my Alma Mater. 
We'd tried Cold Coffee and  Orea Shake. 
Both were pathetic.
I hope I'll find some 'Oreo' the next time I order an Oreo shake here.
Disappointed.

Quaint little place very close to city centre-1. Ranging from recycled bins to painted milk cans, everything adds to the quirkiness quotient. They have a variety of teas and snacks , we chose adrak elaichi chai, Suleimani chai, and pakoras. Add to it enjoyable company,and you have the perfect place to catch up with friends!

Getting hungerpangs and nearby cc1 , you can definitely try this place. A small set up with few outdoor seats , decor done with recycled products , also one can opt for takeaway or getting served in car if parked in front of the shop. I have tried their ADRAKKI CHAI which is very refreshing , BANG BANG MAGGI done in thai style with coconut milk ,COLD COFFEE,  CHEESY BREAD OMLETTE and CHEESE RELOADED FRIES , CHICKEN MASALA BUN all tasty but slightly overpriced. The quality and hygiene is well maintained, this is quite a nice place to grab some roadside tidbits or just sit and chat over cups of tea with friends.

With hundreds of people flocking at Sharma’s or the Stock Exchange or even Gautam’s for that matter, this fancy roadside tea shop is something of a game changer. For one, their menu is very ambitious - ranging from the staple kachori sabzi to rajma chawal to penne arrabiata and mushroom sandwiches, the food is at par with a lot of leading joints in the city. Their ginger tea is a clear winner, better than the namesake (Pappu’s special tea). Their slow service, however, makes up for the excellent food, the clearest winner for the tea shop. Watch out, Sharma’s & Gautam’s, you have a good contender in your vicinity!

A gud joint to hop into with friends and family near city centre 1 just on the main road easy to find, little small but they make sure that u get convenient sitting area for group.
U can visit here not only for chai but they serve vafieties of sides and also appetizers to munch into. Although they have lot of staff involved but it lacks in service and managing the customers. For our order we had to recall the person twice and thrice even for the bill.
As the name suggest we ordered for pappu chai (tasted different than normal chai because of their in house spices may be) with some butter toast and puri with chola, the quality of food except the chai could have been little better as compared to the price charged.

Food is ok but overpriced. Quantity in a plate isn't enough for a small eater. It has parking issues, inefficient staffs, stingy manager who instructed to not provide enough paper napkins. Normal tea/coffee is also overpriced as they are not providing seating option with a controlled temperature. Total weird place. Don't go and waste your money and mood.

Okay so it's a tiny joint just bang opposite BNC in Sector 1. We dropped in one night really hungry. We had ordered Pind Chole with Pooris and a Veg Noodles+Chilli Paneer Combo. Both of them tasted great and wasn't much of a pocket pinch. The ginger tea we ordered was lovely after a long tiring day. All in all, it's a cute joint for some by-the-road Adda with people who matter. 
Attaching one picture of the Chole dish (Forgot to click a pic of the other dishes, we were too hungry.)

Its one small joint serving amazing snacks - be dal makhni with bun, bun maska, adrak tea and pappu chai, everything is delicious. On top of that, thai curry maggie is out of this world.
Must try place people, go there in the evening and go crazy.

A little roadside tea shop with a decor of hanging milk cans. Had wanted to try their chicken keema pav which had sold fast for the day, so opted for the mutton keema pav. Both keema and buns were fresh, hot and tasteful. The Pappu Ki Chai too was well made. A decent place to grab some breakfast, hot chai, Jhal Moohri for afternoon snacks or quick bites.

Located opposite Bidhannagar College near cc1 this place does not have much seating capacity and has thrived on the old idea of having roadside tea sitting on rocks or anywhere you get a space.
Although it has two tables, but mostly people go there and enjoy their tea I'm their cars and on bikes
Their tea is really good, so is their cold coffee and lemon tea.
Their egg pakoda and bread pakoda also tasted good.
Overall it's a good cheap place for quick snacks.

1st of all Pappu is a getting famous day by day!
This place remains crowded especially​ on weekends. On weekdays it is easy to find a seat. If you don't get a seat due to the crowd; don't get upset. You can chill in your car too. Just park your car on front of the stall and they will provide you everything right there. I have tried Kiwi crush, Oreo cookie shake and cold coffee which was good. I also had cheesy chilli​ Maggie​ but that failed​ to impress me.
In short you can visit Pappu Chaiwalla for a long adda session over a cup of coffee or tea.

I went there twice and the experience was good.
They have an outdoor sitting so you can enjoy the evening with tea and some good qucik bites.
The pocket pinch is very low so that makes this place a great food joint.

I had ordered chilly cheese maggi(2/5*), cheese omelette(3.5/5*), chicken keema bun omelette(3.5/5*), chicken keema bun(3/5*) and chicken desi fries(3.5/5*)
MINUS:
•The fries and the toppings could've been delivered separately as the the fries got very soggy since it was home delivered.
•The maggi lacked the amount of cheese as it was just on the top with plain simple maggi resting beneath it.

PLUS:
•It remains open till late at night
•The menu is different from most of the cafes around the area.
•The taste suits perfectly to the Indian taste buds(Hot & Spicy)

"soon it will be the new "adda" for youngsters"

It's a small joint with very few seating arrangement but the food and service is apt.  We were in a mood to have pav so we ordered pav with bhaji and pav with pindi chole. They keep an eye on your plates and if the chole or bhaji is about to finish, they serve extra themselves. A must visit if in a mood to have something sober, spicy and yet budget friendly. :)

After looking through the reviews and the menu of this place,I was really interested in ordering food from here.The place has a very unique concept of breakfast food being served in a new manner.I opted for home delivery of Pappu ka apna sandwich and Surati anda bhurji.The sandwich is a basic grilled cucumber and tomato sandwich with a new addition of thin boiled beetroots and green chutney.I love how they put actual cheese slices instead of mayo which most restaurants do these days.Anyone who likes veggies in sandwiches and the taste of beetroot will love this one.Secondly the Surati anda bhurji,the menu said semi anda bhurji  which is why I ordered it thinking it would be the half cooked version of egg but it was not so,it is a masala bhurji which was later cooked in a curry sauce.This was served with a toasted buttered burger bun.Both of the dishes were tasty and fresh,I look forward to trying the other items on the menu from this place.

One of the best places to be in Saltlake Sector 1. I have been here about 5 -6 times now and I am in love with the place and it's food. They have a beautifully done up eating space that can seat 6-7 people. 

I find it better to order in my car and sit and have there. The service is phenomenal. The food is lip smacking delicious. It gives a great twist to street food and helps curb the after office hunger pangs.

The best things I love in the menu are the Sulemani Chai, The Keema pav, The Bun Maska, The Keema Omelette, Keema Fries , and Puri Keema. 

I know a lot of keema right, but you have other really nice dishes. Do visit and try out. 

Keep up the good work .

Located in the lane between Cc1 and Vidyasagar island. A small tea shop, that is the impression one gets from an outside look. The seating arrangement is extremely funky. They have flexible seats to accommodate big and small groups. Their food options are nice but a little on the higher side but the taste makes up for it. Have so far visited them twice. Once, it was 8 of us, where we tried only their masala tea and green tea because it was winter, and also quite late in the night.
The other instance, we opted for their home delivery of keema bun. Nice experience for both instances.

This small yet interesting looking chai shop is located a few metres away from City Centre 1 and is a popular adda spot for the young and not so young . The interiors are well decorated. During busy hours seating arrangements are made on the front of the cafe . The choice of food here includes typical cafe fare , and is good for some light sip and bite. The chicken tikka sandwich I ordered was filled with shredded chicken and cheese , and was grilled on the outside , though the sides were not removed . The food seemed average , but the best part of this roadside cafe is its dhaba like feel and general happy ambience that keeps the young crowd coming in.
