A pretty average place to dine or order food when you dont feel like cooking. The dishes taste good though there is still room for improvement.

A pretty average place for me to eat out..
We ordered plain rice,daal,alu bhaja..overall average..
Next we ordered aloo posto..which was better i guess..the panchmishali was good..so was the alu potoler jhol
Next the bhetkir jhol..ah well we felt sorry to be served too small pieces of fish..so we approached the manager..who immediately changed the dish..
The mutton kasha was spicy..mutton was less cooked.not good at all..
The chitol fish was average..the aamer chatni was too sweet for me
Overall pretty average stuff for me..economical as well

Bloody theif. Ordered 2 mini fish thali and delivered only one. When we tried to contact them, they hang up the call without even trying to look into this matter.  Most unprofessional staff. They dont even know how to talk to customer and resolve any issue. There should be a zero star button for this.

Bad behaviour of your staff. If told them to wait for 2minutes they dont instead pressure on cancelling the food. Please change the attitide.

Tucked away in a small lane near Nagerbazar more, this place is a small eatery serving the quintessential bengali food. The first thing you notice about this place is its tiny dining space and the cramped interiors. Food is decent and decently priced too. However there is much to improve on their service front. The young boy who was doing the serving, though helpful in nature, was quite clueless regarding restaurant service. We completed our lunch without any glass in which we could pour water from the mineral water bottle. You've got to ask for a spoon even.... Nevertheless the food was good enough and we quickly finished our lunch, thus ending a very forgettable experience.

This place would have been given a much higher rating by me had the service been fast. 

The decor of the place is quite artsy and cute. The food was ah-ma-zing but. We had ordered for plain rice, begun bharta, postor bora, daal, kaatla mach, and egg curry. The postor bora was the only disappointing part of all the dishes. But guys, the rest just shook me. 

Another con of this place besides service is the menu, it is written in Bengali. However please do give it a try.

A bengali restaurant at an affordable price. The location of the restaurant was a bit difficult to find, but it was worth it. The dining area is a bit cumbersome, though the food was absolutely delicious. One downfall was the lack of proper service, as there was poor communication between the kitchen and customers. Other than that it is really worth the price and deserves a second visit.

Tried mutton Kosha. The meat wasn't properly cooked, albeit the curry and its aroma was good. The delivery also was late. Asked for extra salt and green chillies, which weren't delivered with the food. Couldn't enjoy the dinner.

The delivery service is quite speedy . Speaking about the food , we opted for Mocha Ghonto and Postor Bora. None of the items were remarkably excellent and I have never heard about 'mocha' having 'jhol' in it . 'Postor bora' lacked the typical taste of posto and it was kind of stiff .

Although, it is pocket friendly , but the cooking needs a hell lot of improvement.

Did my first order from this company .Got my food delivered on time .guy didnt know directions .Got egg kosha¬† .Egg sizes were as small as possible .Also the gravy that it came in looked like boiled water with added chilli powder it tasted the same as well .there was literally no flavour except for spicy watery flavor .I didnt know Kosha means watery liquid with spice added to it¬† i guess for this company it does .Pretty dissapointed don't think i will order from here again.And of course lacks salt feels like the chef forgot to put it in or was saving salt

Have been looking for "Bong: options nearby other than the already known names like Bhajohori and Kasturi.. So Havatey fitted the bill and wanted to try this new kid-on-block.¬†

Ordered a home delivery on 18th July night. Ordered Posto Bora, Moog daal with vegetables, Katla Doi Rasa & Methi Malai chicken served with Rice.

Delivery - Zomato Delivery was excellent no hassles well within stipulated time
Packaging - The container was well sealed, and best part marked clearly with the menu items

Food -¬†
Posto bora was just fried Posto balls wanting salt to make it taste. My knowledge of Bong cuisine says a wee little bit of green chilli with right amount of salt could actually made this item fly !!!!

Moog daal with vegetables - I have never seen moog daal served so thin!!! it was so watery and the veggies could hardly be found :(

Katla Doi rasa - again it seemed the chef had forgotten to put salt on the fish before frying. The gravy was also wanting in salt!!! And worst, the fish was not best of quality. It clearly smelled raising the question of its freshness. By this time into the food we were totally given up. but..

Methi malai chicken -- saved the day, rather the dinner. It was excellent. The ¬†chicken was fresh and well made and the gravy tasted wonderful with right amount of tangy sweet and chilli flavoured with Methi and garlic.

Serving Portions - Generally its good serving portions. Chicken and Fish portions were generous.¬†

Overall rating will only be 3. The chicken pulled it up honestly... But I will not give up on this joint on my first experience. Got to try the other items yet... Till then keep improving...

Went there during the pujas to avoid standing in long queues outside popular resturants. The behaviour of the owner was very good and the food was also good in a reasonable price. The only drawback was most of the items enlisted in the menu were unavailable.

Pure Bengali Cuisine... They prepare authentic bengali dishes, including a few rare ones, which many other similar restaurants dont even dare to prepare and serve... Methi malai chicken and daab chingi are a must try here...  Courteous and friendly staff... And most importantly the whole menu is very much pocket friendly... It is a must visit for all those who have a taste for authentic bengali cuisine...

I visited this place few days back and ordered for badshahi thali, daab chingri, mutton ghee roast, and chicken methi malai..
All of the items were superb..the restaurants owners Raju and Arindam were very courteous and friendly. I would suggest to place your order 1 day in advance to avoid the waiting period. Special mention - posto borra, chicken methi malai and the daab-chingri...truly commendable...Pure bengali food and feeling like food from mom's kitchen..I would have given a 5/5 rating for this place but for the quantity of food served in the thali I am putting a 4/5 to it. Check the photos.
