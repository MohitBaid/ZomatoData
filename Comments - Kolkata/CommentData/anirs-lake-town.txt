Ordered Chilly chicken and mixed fried rice, quantity is good, sufficient for 2people, chilly chicken pieces are soft and juicy . Mixed fried rice has got good amount of prawn,chicken pieces but taste was just ok. Good for take away but not very good, they can improve on quality!!!!!

Good food. The "Fish Orly" is mouth-watering. Good biryani too. A bit slow in home delivery. Their egg chicken roll is just too good. A good nearby fast food centre.

I ordered food from here through Swiggy and trust me, I am glad that I chose this place. Tasty Biriyani along with the chicken dishes. Everything was perfect. At first was a little skeptical but then as happy. Prices are okay too.

The food from this place is of awful quality. The team doesn't know that starter items ought to be dry, hence, you get a yogurt and curry leaf gravy for chicken 65 and a horrible red gravy in the name of mushroom and baby corn chilli. The American chopsuey further was the worst one can ever taste. The fried noodles had a layer of dalda over them as I served myself a bit late and the taste was nothing close to how it should be. Funny, this plate of yucky mess cost us 500+ . We already feel funny inside our stomach and we need to have medicines before retiring for bed, as we are unsure how this degraded quality of food would affect our health.

Located beside jaya cinema this is a small food joint serving north indian and mughlai. They have a small sitting arrangement on the first floor. The place does not look very hygienic. Coming to the food i ordered chicken biryani and Chicken chap. The biryani was good enough. The chicken chap was too oily and tasted below average. The staff is very friendly though. Prices are cheap.

Ordered from this place through Zomato for their low prices food. But got the lesson cheap option doesn't always come good.

Crispy Chicken : Unlike other places their Crispy Chickn wasn't very dry, rather it was bit juicy. Rich spices mixed with red, yellow & green capsicum tasted good. But chicken pieces were very hard & chewy.

Chicken Fried Rice : It was very ordinary with sufficient pieces of chicken & eggs. It wasn't much spicy nor it was very likely with side dishes. Quantity was sufficient.

Chilli Chicken : It was less chilli chicken more hot & sour soup with full of small cut garlic pieces in it. The gravy wasn't thick & tasted very bad, even with the rice. However chicken pieces were big, soft & juicy.

Chilli Fish Dry : Chilli Fish was clearly made of Vola Vetki rather than original Vetki. It smelt bit fishy, but rich mixed spices somehow hides that. It tasted below average but big 10 pices were enough for the price.

Total bill for all those items for 3 people was near to Rs. 800. Although the food quality over here wasn't very good, still the quantity of every dish for the price was justifying. Also they delivered the exect order in time.

Looking at the price and quantity they deliver is really appreciable. Quality wise also decent and tasted quite well too. Only thing is it's a bit oily but that can be execused as well. All in all I really liked their preparations as being a small food joint they serve quite good food.

We had PAN FRIED CHICKEN, CHICKEN BIRIYANI,  BUTTER NAN, MASALA KULCHA, KADHAI CHICKEN. 
The chicken items were fine but the kulcha unexpectedly turned out to be awesome.  Biriyani was okayish. 
I would recommend you to go for their mughlai items.  Best part that you don't feel the penny pinch at all.

This place is kinda famous for the quantities they offer. Even a foodie like me can't finish a plate of their biriyani. And it's the same with every single item on the menu. Try their chicken and cheese roll. Very tasty and heavy. Fills you up real good. And you get more cheese if you look intimidatingly at the guy adding grated cheese in your roll.

I understand that putting a 2.5 out of 5 might be incorrect by trying only one item from a place, still Anir's at lake town couldn't impress me in any terms. 
1. Sitting arrangement - No
2. Hygiene - No, just a street side open place
3. Staff behaviour - I paid the 25 rupees at the counter, there was no other customer at that time still it took me around 2-3 minutes to handover the bill to the person who would prepare the roll.
Overall, for the first time visit, it didn't go nice for me. They have varieties of preparations in store mostly inclined towards north indian foods. Prices of the food are not that high. While leaving the place I found one customer came down there for the biriyani parcel, the mutton piece that was put inside the box was not at all satisfactory for me!!

Very very poor service in terms of delivery. I had to follow up even with the delivery person. Ordered chilli chicken, fried rice and chicken drumsticks. Chilli chicken was better than OK, fried rice not upto the mark and drumsticks are good to have. They are tasty. But food delivered at the end of 2 hours. So not ordering again.

The most bullshit delivery service. After waiting for near about 1.5 hrs that too the place of delivery was 5-10 mins from the restaurant... The delivery guy was not at all sorry.. Says aapko lena h toh lijiye warna chorie.. Atleast if not compensating for this bullshit, then he must have been atleast little humble and apologetic.. Very disappointed..

The worst outlet for a snacks counter in kolkata. The worst service. The worst food quality. The worst service timing. We ordered one simple veg rice and chicken. It took them exactly one hour and 53 mins to serve. Anir should seriously think about upgrading their service quality or else it will be soon when people will stop visiting this disgusting food outlet.

Located at very closed to jaya cinema. Price of the food is high but quantity and taste is very good. One thing is that people have to wait much time for deliver the food.

This restaurant is near my place. The foods they serve are pretty good at their respective costs. I like their chicken fried rice,chicken biryani & chicken bharta. This are among the most tasty items i have had here. Their gravy items are way too oily & thus i prefer avoiding any gravy items from this place.

I have never been to their dining section but got my food delivered a few times. Their delivery is prompt. I have always received my order within 20-30mins & even the people taking the order over phone are very helpful & friendly. Had been trying their mughal dishes for all the time now,I opted for the Chinese dishes this time. We ordered Egg Chicken fried rice & Schezwan Chicken. The fried rice was a hero..but sad to say I didn't like the taste of the Schezwan Chicken. Among the mughlai dishes, the Chicken biriyani & the chicken bharta are quite good & again the gravy items are not so good. Yet to try their kebabs though. One huge drawback for this restaurant is the food is cooked in too much oil! Especially the gravy items are literally drowned under a layer of oil! I think the management should look into this otherwise quite a decent place for both Chinese & Mughlai dishes.loo

The Place opened few months back, with excellent menu and service. The Fried Rice is my favorite. Rolls are also good and fresh. Within time this place has become hit within the area. 
The Veg menu needs to looked into. The price is also fairly done. Only hope with time it gets better and not take customers for granted like many

The place is fairly new. I came here knowing the reputation of the Shyambazar outlet. The rolls are famous. So is the chinese items. My favourites are the Chicken 65, Fish Manchurian and Cantonese Pan fried Noodles better known as the Gravy Chowmien. The quantity is very good. The food healthy and Pricing also very reasonable.

Its a must try if you are from laketown or bangur.....

Rarely do we come across a joint which servers authentic platter of two diverse cuisine..and Anir's does just that!..you'll be in for a pleasant surprise with their Kebabs and Biriyani. Those far  surpassed my expectations..specially the kebabs..so tender and juicy!...Tried some Chinese dishes the other day..tasted really authentic, except may be, for the gravy..which was a bit flat. Overall a very decent joint. Highly recommended.

A small joint serving decent food. Ordered a mixed fried rice, mixed noodles, hot and sour soup and a chilli garlic chicken. The fried rice was the hero of the meal. The noodles were at best, mediocre. The hot and sour soup was too sweet for my taste. The chicken was tough to eat. It was hot as hell without any taste. There was a pool of oil in which a few chicken were helplessly dunked in it.

Lovely place

if you live at Lake town you will know about scarcity of good reasonable versatile restaurant here....... suddenly then we came to know that Anir is opening a branch here, just near the jaya  multiplex.. I have been at the shyambajar branch before and know they serve excellent quality of food... the ambience is a little small... however enough of introduction let's come to the main point... they serve the softest tandoori possible..... try their mixed fried rice you will not be dissapoined.. biriyani is good.... just the other day tried their chicken rolls... the paratha was so crispy... and the chicken was so soft.... just today we visited there and the staff served free cold drinks.. really felt honored!!!! kudos to you Anir's... keep serving us!!!! :)

Tried the double egg chicken roll and the chicken biriyani.  Both are great considering their own respective price ranges. Quantity given for both the items were splendid. The eatery, although new is already the one of the best in the area.
