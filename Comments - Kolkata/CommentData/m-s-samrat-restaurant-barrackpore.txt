Comfort food is what u can find here.  Though this place is a bit expensive.  Located near chiriyamore, having one of the most lucrative locations in barrackpore this resturant Isn't doing good these days.  The ambience they provide is really average and the interiors of the restaurant is quiet congested.  Service is good.  Fish kabiraji is a must try over here.  
The quantity of food they serve is good.. 1plate of mixed chowmin can feed an average of 2 people.

This small restaurant is located near Jayanti Multiplex of Barrackpore, adjacent to BT road.

Ambience is nice with small sitting arrangements.

Tried sweet corn soup,  chilli garlic Hakka chowin & Chicken lollypop. Soup was nice with nice fillings, noodles was spicy, tangy and of sufficient quantity. Chicken lollypop was average.

Pocket pinch is ok but food quality and taste is above average .

I guess most of my treats of any occasions I had in this restaurant. In this many visits I've enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. As I live in outskirts I guess it's one of the best. On our recent visit we have ordered usual mixed fried rice, garlic chicken and chicken dopeyaja, and drumsticks as starters. I loved garlic chicken and fried rice very much. But others felt a bit low. I don't know it may be me. Overall it has maintained it's standard.

This is a restaurant that has perhaps run its course. It is one of the oldest restaurant in barrackpore. It served one of the best paratha and tandoori based dishes. But alas those days are gone. This is mostly an empty house now. With the quality diminished, and not much of an ambiance left there is nothing much left in this restaurant.
Maybe a revamp of the place can bring back some glory, but for that we have to wait and watch.

Just about fine. It is located in Barrackpore chiriamore which is a very busy part of the town. That's why it attracts regular pedestrians. Some of the foods are great. And others are not bad.  I've been here more than five times in last five years. On that location this is the best option available.

It is one of the oldest restaurants in barrackpore!
Quality is no more that great,if you order beside fried rice chicken!!
I recently had there,ordered biriyani and fish kobiraji!
Biriyani was total mess!no taste of biriyani,it was full of jab jabe oil!
Fish kobiraji was good, but I had to use papers to soak extra oil!
Advice:you can go for regular items!

Not a very good place to go, with bad quality of food and unhygienic too. After their renovation their standards have degraded. It is advisable not to visit this place and spoil your mood and apetite.

This is one of those places where my parents dated during their courtship period, so I obviously have some strong sentiments attached with this place.Samrat underwent a face-lift in the recent years but it still is quite small in space. My first visit to this place was inadvertently with my parents who naturally became to nostalgic and romantic being here.Coming to the food, although I didn't have huge expectations from this place, the food here is quite good. Nothing amazing to write home about but not bad either. The ambiance isn't much but if you are visiting in the evenings, the dim-lights serve their purpose. The service is okay (although I have heard of delays) and the price too is not that extravagant. Â 
Located in Chiriamore, the place is worth a visit if only for ther Chicken Tikka Masala.

This restaurant used to be a good place to hang out. But once they renovated their plave and gave it a good look. They messed with the quality of food and food preparation. Their biryani which used to be a average one become a mess. And its not about Biryani only, but also the whole lot of food they serve. I will not recommend anyone, a waste of money and mood.

Now this is a fun restaurant. There is absolutely nothing special about this place. This place has nothing special to offer that'd make you visit it again. This restaurant is as dull as it can get (thanks to the dull interior decorations). It is a two-storied diner but the overall space is very small and the stairway that leads to the first floor is roughly about 2.5 feet in width. The food that they serve tastes fairly good and is quite cheap. So basically its a 25-seater, matchbox sized restaurant that has the dullest ambience which serves good food at a cheap price.

Samrat Restaurant is one the few old restaurants in Barrackpore.. Located at Barrackpore Chiriamore.. Its quite easy to locate as its situated at the heart of Barrackpore. 
The restaurant is quite average..rather i find the red walls awful. I prefer to take away the food rather than dinning there. 
This AC restaurant has two floors,the 1st floor have a good view of Chiriamore. 
The place offers north indian and chinese..but food is average.Among all items i specially like their chicken fried rice and Chicken tikka masala is my favourite.. ( Must try ) 
But that's it...the service is very poor.. I mean it's very slow and the staffs have no idea regarding the food and top it all sometimes they argue against their poor quality of food.The quantity is enough for two if we order one plate.. The price is reasonable but somehow i feel they need to improve on their quality of food and service.

Though it is a bit away from barrackpore station,this place is most ideal for dinner after movie at jayanti multiplex...food in this place is tasty and the service is also very good...prices r normal...but the place is little clumsy..i would prefer to go to the first floor for the road view..

one of the oldest restaurants of barrckpore,located at chiriamore barrackpore beside jayanti movie hall and it was a multicuisine restaurant serving north indian ,tandoor and chinese platters. though recently it is serving chinese food only
its a very cosy restau having a ground floor and a 1st floor and i will recommend the upstairs as from there you will get a better view of road.
the staffs are quite decent and guides you well though theres nothing interesting on the menu.
quality of fud is good with quite ok taste but quantity wise the food is huge and 1plate ofanything can be shared inbetween two. price is quite low compared to the food quality.
if you are in barrackpore and you want a low budget ac restau with decent food,go for samrat.

The place a bit away from the station, situated at chiriamore, looses on popularity because of the location, which it might have achieved,given a location near the station.

They provide a top-floor seating along with the ground one and you can choose a seat near the window, overlooking the city.

The ambience is okay and decorations minimalistic.

The staff behaviour is decent.

The food quality is good, it's tasty, but nothing great. Also the quantity is good.

A budget-friendly place for family dinners or lunches with friends.
