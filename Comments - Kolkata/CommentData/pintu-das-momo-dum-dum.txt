I might trigger a lot of hatred for this, but I find the momos in this quaint little shop as good as, if not better than, Bapu Da'r momos (Salt Lake).
Located on platform number 3, near the stepping rocks, it's pretty easy to locate.
Extremely light on the pocket, and a taste that will make you keep coming back for more.
I mean, who gives 5 steamed chicken momos and soup and different kinds of chutneys for 20 bucks?! Or pan fried momos for 25! The prices are crazy. And so is the taste. They'll ask you about your exact preference (because we all have our favourites, don't we?), and will make it as per your taste buds.
Only little hiccup is maybe that it's a roadside shack so it might not be the best when it comes to hygiene, but they try their level best.
What's more? The owner is very friendly and genuinely loves cooking, so he keeps trying new flavours of momos every weekend, ranging from apple momos, cherry momos, chocolate momos, etc etc. He'll invite you to drop by on weekends to try these flavours with an absolutely infectious joy!
EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED. ðŸ˜ƒ
