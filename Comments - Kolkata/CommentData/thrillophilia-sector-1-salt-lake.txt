Nice place to party and enjoy. Awesome ambience.  
Good hookah. Nice service. Staff are polite. We ordered Pizza,  French Fries,  Garlic Bread and Jalapeno Cheese Ball's.  Food was tasty.  Deep blue sea in  mocktail segment was awesome.

Great ambience in salt lake which is least expected especially it's pool side view and seating area.. Sheesha is not good and I will say pathetic service to it's customers.. On a busy Sunday they don't have enough well trained staff to look after their guests..totally disappointing service!!

Super poor service. They can surely be awarded with the worst hospitality management award. No sense of responsibility after taking the order. Had to ping them for 5-7 times just to get a shisha. Hopeless People. Dont visit.

One of your staff Rishav all over staff are good. I think Rishav should know how to behave with customers n learn more about the job. Instead of roaming around girls ... he should know the rules of the cafe where he is working. Bad experience because of Rishav.

This sky lounge has newly opened and is a part of the Golden Tulip hotel in Sector 1. It is located about 5 mins from City Centre 1, close to The Sonnet.
The reason such a high rating is that when new places like this open up, initially there are a lot of issues with management and service. But to my delight, my experience here was quite soothing and enjoyable.
Spell-binding ambience is the USP of this place. You have the option to relax inside the jacuzzi, provided you have the appropriate clothes. Since there aren't any taller buildings in the vicinity, a cool breeze blows throughout.

I found the food to be decent/good. The Double Cheese Pizza and Crispy Chilli Babycorn along with the mocktails were pretty good. However, the White Sauce Pasta was okayish.
The main thing which is gonna attract the crowd here is hookah. We had the Candy-Teen Pan flavour which was very nice. The base also included slices of kiwi to enhance the flavour. Since there is steady breeze blowing, the coal doesn't last long. But the reviews are positive.

Being a hotel, one can expect the service to be extremely comforting. The floor manager is polite to talk to. There was some issue with our bill, which he politely sorted out. All in all, Thrillophilia doesn't fail to impress and can definitely be recommended to others.

I was delighted to be here.
The place had a different atmosphere which just took my heart.
I was in the sky bar - it had several type of sitting area - one was jacuzzi, one normal chair seating, one sofa area ( with a shade on top ) & the most interesting one was swing in the form of a tent.
The most impressive thing which was there was their staff - so humble and courteous to talk to.
There are very few places where the staff treats you like a king.
Food - i had ordered for potato roesti - the presentation was very new to me which i have had earlier in other places.
The taste was spectacular yet again loved it.
Drinks - chocolate crumbs - lovely.
Highly recommended.
