Food is not so good as well as the ambience. If ambience sucks in any restaurant then the attraction for going to that place again gradually decreases..

I drop by this place during pujo season. The main thing is this place was over crowded. So the ambience is just horrible. The food was also not upto that mark. So on average it was not a place to refer someone else.

Visited this place with friends for a treat, and it was not a good experience at all. 

Food quality was awful. Price compared to Quality was not worthy at all. Tasted over 7-8 different preparation starting from fish - chicken starters to noodles and rice dishes as main course, but all of them tasted like Street food. Ambience and services were not good. 
More over that, they charge you 5% service tax for absolutely no service. So it's a NO NO NO from me.

So I came here on 13.08.2017 for lunch at a party. Our appetizers were a classic hot and sour soup, prawn chips, panko fish, thread chicken, drumsticks, and chilli prawn.
The soup was of a nice thick consistency filled with chicken. It was extremely flavorful.
Panko fish stole the show, its crispy coating and tender fish within was extremely well made.
Thread chicken was an innovative dish where the pieces of chicken were covered in noodles and deep fried. The chicken inside was a bit sweet but it balanced out.
The drumsticks was regular but it was good.
The chilli prawn was juicy.
After this we were already full so we cut the main course short. We had mixed hakka noodles, mixed fried rice, Cantonese noodles, duck in choice of sauce, chicken with mix vegetables, Manchurian chicken.
The main course was fine, here the duck bowled us over with its crisp yet succulent pieces of meat. The duck was boneless and cooked to perfection. 

I will not be able to comment on the pocket pinch but the food quantity for a plate is sufficient for two to@ three people. 
Service was good, staff were courteous and helpful.
Not many pictures because we were busy eating all the food üòçüòç

Needless to say..... I have checked out almost each and every restaurant in China town (tangra) area, and this 1's one of them and can be categorised as a "more than average" restaurant.Again, needless to say,any restaurant in this area will provide you with authentic Chinese dishes,n this 1's no exception‚Äã. Quantity of food is appreciable. Ambience is nothing much to talk about,but again it is a spacious restaurant.I specially loved their prawn starter and Cantonese Noodles. But 1 of my friend was very disappointed with a mocktail,it was just waste of üí∞. Staffs r a bit arrogant. Now,prices r a bit high here, almost same like Golden joy or Beijing. But the restaurant doesn't look as sumptuous as Golden Joy or Beijing or Big Boss etc... But it's not a bad place to have food at,if u r only concerned about good chinese food..... 4 people can enjoy a 4 course Chinese meal within Rs1200, which comes down to 300 each.....A bowl of healthy soup for each, 4-5 pcs of starter for each(don't worry, portion size is good enough üòã),1 full dish of main course is to be shared by 2, and 1 full plate of side is enough for 4 people,coz each 1 will get 4 pcs,as the full plate contains around 16-17 pieces of chicken/lamb/prawn/fish, whatever u order..... And don't worry about gravy....U might feel like bathing in it,such is the quantityü§ó. Although 1 side dish is never enough for bhukkads like me... But hey, if u r not a gobbler like me(no shame in admitting itü§ó) the above given detailed meal plan will suit u easily.... go for it.

This is just another tangra outlet, but the food is good. By good I meant easy to digest and treat for taste buds. The fried rice is really great, tast wise awesome, quantity wise too, but the quality of ingredients could be better. The sides are great either but didn't seem of much special mention or attention to me. Moreover an one time visit.

It's cheap food ... Great place to go with our branded people... We went there in a group of 19-20 people... Our army took 4tables... We ordered mixed fried rice along with Singapore and lemon chicken maybe I don't remember as some of our friends ordered... Some of us had beer... Kingfisher wala sasta beer... For a pint we paid 120 with tax... God knows when this beer taboo will go off the country... And we can have it in roads... But to my expectation with this country and people like this... If such a law is established then the whole country goes drunk. . So some such laws are necessary... Overall it's a 3/5 but 0.5 more for the ash tray and allowing smoking...... Mandarin all the best...

We went there a group of 18 people and they provided tables for us without much fuss. We ordered   mixed fried rice and mixed rice noodles as the main courses and schezwuan , Hunan, Singaporean chicken as sides and beer . The quantities for the sides are huge . The food was nice , especially the rice . The collection of beers though is very less. Still a nice place in China town if you are looking for a cheaper option as compared to Beijing or golden joy or big boss

This is not so known name in China Town, but once you go there you will not go anywhere else. I used to visit Big Boss,Golden Joy but as usual there is too much rush and waiting time to get a table in these places. But then just by chance I tried Mandarin one day and since then I only visit Mandarin in Tangra.
Big seating space so they can accommodate a group of even 15 without any issue. 
Price is very pocket friendly.
Family space is separate from the drinking zone, so now issue taking your family and kids. They have a bug aquarium with many exotic fishes to keep your little ones busy as you dine.
****Must Order Panko Fish. I bet you won't be disappointed.
Food is very nice. Both quantity and quality is great.
They also have many dishes which are not printed in menu just ask the staff to suggest by telling them your preference.

Alcohol price is also cheap as in any other Tangra outlet.

A great place to be and njoy the time.

Just check if their card swapping machine is working or not faced this problem twice and had to pay in cash.üòû

.It was a very good gesture...üëç
Food was good (no differences with any other chinese resturents@)..though i did'nt remember the names..drinks are costly...overall we were satisfied..lets jump into quick ratings üëá
üëâLOCATION: Beside Golden Joy,easy to find in Chinatown, 4.5/5
üëâSTAFF : They all were very gentel and very well behaved.. i loved their service , 5/5

I had never been to Mandarin Gourmet until last Sunday when we decided to explore a new place at China Town! We were the first ones to enter the family section and typically the last ones to leave! So here's a few observations.

The guys are courteous and smiling as you enter however lose their charm the moment people start flowing in and the pressure for multiple orders starts building. At the peak hours, they literally lose it, forgetting orders altogether and becoming baseline rude with the customers!

We had ordered threaded chicken for starters which was pretty ¬†nice and crisp, but the chicken hakka noodles in the main course was downright bland and tasteless. The sidey prawns could have been better made and I have nothing in particular to say about the Garlic chicken except for that it was pretty bland again!

There is nothing much to report about the ambiance and decor except for a beautiful aquarium which greets you at the entrance to the family section. The place is pretty sprawling as some of the contemporaries in the same area.¬†

Overall, a by the way kinda experience yeaahhh! The most important bit, keep your calm under pressure :-) That way customers will overlook your mistakes too!

I have been very regular to this restaurant whenever I visit China Town. They were quite popular among us. 

Located inside China Town the lane to where golden joy is located. 

Decor and ambiance is very nice. The big aquariums creates a lively environment as well. While entering you will find a wide long staircase which gives a very rich look to this place. They have family and only men section separate. That's a good idea for places like this.

Food is quite average. I have had a lot of Chinese dishes of course the regular ones no the exquisite ones prefer not to order . also I go for noodles than fried rice as I found them to make it better. 
Drinks available at a very cheap rate as they charge them bottle wise.

Service is very decent and quick. Staffs are quite courteous and helpful as well. Good place for friends Hangout.

Taste of everything will just blow your brains (even the simple dry chilly chicken!) is like wow...Soup is amazing. And the quantity!

Wins hand down anytime - Mainland china - hope you are listening!

The only drawback is the location...the tannery makes things unbearable while entering this area.

Yesterday I visited the place for the first time with my dear friend. Normally I go to Cin Shing but this time I tried to check this out as my friend said that its food it delicious.
It is situated at the end of a very narrow lane in Tangra. An usher escorted us to the wall where the car should be parked. As I went in, I started liking the ambience of the restaurant.  Beautifully decorated and neat and clean. There is a large aquarium in the midst of the restaurant where lovely fish were seen swarming by.
The waiters came forward and selected our seats and made us comfortable. My friend who has been there before ordered Panko Fish. Now what on earth was that? I thought. It soon came forth, in the form of batter- fried pieces fish which looked hard from outside but when you take a bite, it simply melts in the mouth. Altogether a delicious experience. Besides drink, we also took chilly garlic chicken, but this I did not like as much as it tasted like ordinary chicken pakora.
Can't tell about bill as my friend made the payment.
If I ever return here, I shall come back here solely for the Panko fish. Simply delicious.

Being drunk, you can not remember half of the dishes you ordered. But I tried to. I am coming back to that. First, let me tell you,it was an outing regarding a new car test drive for a long trip.4 people. Honda city SV. A great car to hang with. Now, China town, tangra ; is a residential complex of native chinese people. Rather I came to know that they lives here since before the independence of India. People of Kolkata come here for good Chinese food and off course to drink in a cheap rate. As you all know I prefer restaurant which provides liquor. Manderin is a good restaurant. They provide food in a good quantity. Their service is nice.
Now we ordered Hot and Sour mixed soup and Thai mixed soup. Deep thick tasty hot soup they served to slurp which was good enough to upsurge your appetite.
3tuborg strong. A plate of French Fries and a plate of Fish batter fry kind of item was there in our table after that. Fish item was definitely a root to culture the rest of our food order journey. Medium fried brown outer layer was oily and showing its not raw from inside. A very rare taste to munch.
Then came Ginger & Garlic Duck, a Chicken item and a Green Salad. Oh another 3 bottles of Tuborg. God knows why I love beer so much!!!
Btw Duck's dish was a nice item. Shredded and a bit of spice with rough crisp from inside. Chicken dishes we try so often that sometimes even if it's good, we overlook the taste. It was something a bit of that what I felt. Then the time came we ordered lunch. A plate of Chinese Chop Suey and Two Hakka Mixed Chow. A poached egg was missing on the top of chop suey and ample amount of gravy wasn't present. Hakka chow was so average in taste... Quantity sometimes is not appropriate to mention even if it's enough. There was a bottle of tuborg while we were having lunch. Cheap enough??? I do not think so. End of the story.
P.s. I forgot my phone while coming back... I went back there. They gave back the phone which they have collected.

The list of drinks is very disappointing. Very limited options available. The ambiance was not appealing at all, apart from a huge aquarium which drew attention as we went in. The food? Well this was the only factor which made up for others. The mandarin fish is worth trying, it's their signature dish. The quantity or portion size they serve adds a bit of value to what you spend.
Now again, authentic chinese food is what we expect in a place so called "China town"

Food is good here. The chinese here has a scent different from others.
You can dug into a whole variety of appetisers and main course. Served with liquor, makes your day.
Service is real quick. Makes you feel at home.

It was something a bit of that what I felt. Then the time came we ordered lunch. A plate of Chinese Chop Suey and Two Hakka Mixed Chow. A poached egg was missing on the top of chop suey and ample amount of gravy wasn't present. Hakka chow was so average in taste... Quantity sometimes is not appropriate to mention even if it's enough. There was a bottle of tuborg while we were having lunch. Cheap enough??? I do not think so. End of the story.
P.s. I forgot my phone while coming back... I went back there. They gave back the phone which they have collected.

Try Tangy fish and salt n pepper crab claws. Avoid visiting during Durga Puja.

The list of drinks is very disappointing. Very limited options available. The ambiance was not appealing at all, apart from a huge aquarium which drew attention as we went in. The food? Well this was the only factor which made up for others. The mandarin fish is worth trying, it's their signature dish. The quantity or portion size they serve adds a bit of value to what you spend.
Now again, authentic chinese food is what we expect in a place so called "China town"

Just like the other tangra cuisines.
Food is good here. The chinese here has a scent different from others.
You can dug into a whole variety of appetisers and main course. Served with liquor, makes your day.
Service is real quick. Makes you feel at home. 
Saddest part, makes a big hole in the pocket if you are not prepared !!

food is definitely good. specially tangy chicken and chilly garlic pepper chicken. soup is also far better than any joints around. nice option in tangra. staff very helpful in suggesting good dishes.

I have been visiting this place since i was a kid... The people here are not at all the way the others described... If you know what to order they will serve you their best...try the crispy skin duck in choice of  sauce and the tangy fish..

This is not one of the more popular restaurants in China town.The reason is simple.The food is not good enough compared to others in the area.
But we friends generally visit this place in china town when we want to booze.The place is spacious and is quite empty at most times.The food is...well...decent.Considering these we feel its a good choice if you are more interested in drinks than food.If you are more interested in food there are quite a few other better options around.

I have been in this place for quite a few times. there are pros and cons for everything under this sun and so does this restaurant.  they have got a nice parking place wherein you do not have to leave your car on the road rather you can keep it in a narrow lane opposite to the restaurant. now about the greetings, the staffs are not so well trained and cant even pronouns the names of the foods properly. the foods which they suggested are more or less of no difference. nothing very catchy or extra ordinary. as for the prize it is reasonable compared to the other ones in the locality.

the most bad part was when i ordered steamed wanton with gravy sauce in it, they brought me what you can say in layman's language just momo without the soup and sauce. it was really very disheartening. when you order something and you get something else. any ways i did not complain to them. but one thing i will make sure that is i will never, ever visit the place again.

I dont agree with the above reviews. Either the above two foodies doesn't have a taste for chinese cuisine or they have ordered items which the restaurant is not that good at.
I will definitely advice you guys to give it a try.
The receipes which i prefer:
STARTERS-
Chilli Garlic Pepper chicken
Hoysin Chicken(it's there new addition)
Panko Fish
GRAVY ITEMS-
Hot Garlic chicken
Chicken manchurian
Chicken in Green Sauce
Schezwan Chicken
RICE OR NOODLES:
Mixed Friedrice/ Schezwan Mixed Friedrice
Chicken rice noodles/Canton noodles
(Generally i dont prefer soup much but you can order as there is a large varities of soup present)

my first visit to China town. a sudden decision with my cousins to go there and I was naturally excited. it was quite late at night around 9 and the place looked really scary and desolate. we were hungry and chose this restaurant as it was the first that greeted us. 
the food is too full of soya sauce and I am kind of too allergic to over taste of it. but besides that,  the mushrooms we ordered were soft and tasted different. the chicken was also delectable. but there was nothing special in the food.

the ambience was bland . there was only an aquarium. I will remember this place not for the food but for two important news I got that time.

visited there once with whole family and friends....
ended up with an ordinary experience, as the food is very ordinary and cannot be compared even to a small extent with the other restaurants of chinatown, kolkata.
