Even Van should not taste it.

If some one is low on budget and looking for complete meal you may fall in trap. I ordered for Rajesthani thali.

Delivery- It was delivered on time (+1)

Packaging- It was packed in seal packed plastic thali with no spill. (+1)

Food- I got Dal Makhani Mix Veg and Alu Dum & 5 pcs of roti , Rice . All I could say is not a single thing was good Dal Makhani was way too oily. Got one pc of alu dum and Mix was just carrots and beans. Rice was hard.The proportion of roti and rice to gravy is way too less I had 2 pcs roti left. Gulab Jamun was average. There are way more better option than this for late night food cravings. Do not fall in trap. 

Verdict- Serving late night won't save you however food quality will.

No comments on the food for I never received my order after them refusing to deliver. Major highlight being, the manager highlighted on the app that it's out for delivery all this while. 
More importantly, he comes up as a rude guy on call, who wants to coerce me into giving him 5 stars even after he can't put any logic out of his mouth. This really makes me doubt their service quality hugely. 
Don't even try them, more often than not, they will disappoint you. Rude people make a very bad place to order food from. DONT REPEAT THE MISTAKE. 

From the one who's at the Van but hasn't yet Tasted.

Van tasted is an unique name and they are specialist in North Indian food. Nice place and the food quality is good too. We also had ordered from this joint several times and the quality remains the same.

I HAD ORDERED NORTH INDIAN THALI . 129 RUPEES . THE FOOD QUALITY AND QUANTITY WAS PERFECT . ONLY TWO PROBLEMS SALT WAS A BIT HIGH IN DAAL MAKHANI AND MISSING SWEET . BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE TRYING OUT VAN TASTED MOST ECONOMICAL AND HYGIENIC FOOD .

This place is a hell of a life saver . I was having semester exams and was hungry at 2 am in the morning. I opened Zomato to see that they were still accepting orders.
Coming to the thali , I ordered the SPECIAL thali which costs ‚Çπ129/- .. the meal was properly sealed and arrived hot and fresh , the mixed veg and dal makhni was perfect.
The peas pulao had enough soft green peas to fill every scoop of Ur spoon . You get 4 butter tawa rotis which taste exactly like home cooked roti .
Will surely order from here in future .
