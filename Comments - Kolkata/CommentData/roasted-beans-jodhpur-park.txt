Yesterday we visited this newly opened place near jodhpur park and let me tell everyone that the experience was good.
We had ordered French fries, Cream Chowder, Traditional Egg Rice and Hot Garlic Fish.
All four items were up to the mark especially the rice..Pocket Pinch - just below 600 bucks for two people
I would personally recommend it to everyone..
The staff were well behaved and very humble.
Must visit place

Instead of going to those insanely famous restaurants on 31st we opted for this newly opened joint in Dhakuria.  We all have that super confusing family dinner where everyone ends up ordering a lot of food from different cuisine.

The first thing that came into my mind after entering is that they have got a decent space and could have done a lot more regarding the interior; like playing with colors, themes or even furnishing. 

¬†It started with soups and salads. The Manchow soup was, well, nothing out of the ordinary. They served us veg caesar salad instead of chicken but it was good enough. The sauce they used in Chicken Wings was quite delectable. Meanwhile, I took the liberty of ordering a Chicken Barbeque Pizza. It came with a thin crust and a lot of toppings with a good amount of cheese, definitely recommended. 

Our main course was mostly Chinese, one Rice one Noodles and one Chicken. The servings were huge and the food was decent enough. The waiter asked me to order a red bull infused drink so I did. I have never been a fan of energy drinks but it was presented nicely with the can of red bull plunged into the mocktail glass.

There is one small snag, a relatively slower service.

A new cafe in Jodhpur Park with nice and humble interiors. Excellent hospitality and great staff. The decors could be slightly improved though. We ordered-

Chicken bruchetta - this came in five slices of garlic bread with sumptuous chicken mayonese spread. The dish typically reminded me of malai toast because of its look. Very tasty and filling. Loved it!

BBQ chicken pizza - thin crust pizza with a curry like topping. The pizza tasted soso... Too much spicy for my liking and the layer tasted like chilli chicken gravy with not enough veggies. Not really happy about it.

Overall a nice homely cafe with quite a decent choice in menu. A lift could be thought of as its on the second floor and elderly people could visit too without having to climb many stairs. Also the pizza needs improvement. Waiting time is pretty long. A pocket friendly place for a nice treat.

Nice place with good ambience.Waiters very friendly and they ask for our choice of music .The food quality was really good. We ordered Crispy chicken wings roasted with BBQ sauce ( 6 descent pieces dipped in BBQ sauce) as appetizer. For main course we ordered:
1. Lamb chop sizzler
2. Roasted beans special chicken
3. Roasted beans special pork
Each of those were finely cooked except the sauce added to the pork was pretty rich apart from it others were good. Overall nice time spent there with friends.

Today I went to this place with my friend for the first time. We ware  expecting some good cup of coffee and some good snacks, but what we got there is much more than that. Today a group of standup comedians named "KALKUTTA KOMEDIANS" were performing there. So the cappuccino and fish finger got much more testy with the total experience. We like this place and the food and drinks as well.

So we planned our 31st lunch here and luckily managed to grab a table pretty easily. The decor of this place is subtle yet classy. So we ordered 

CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS IN BBQ SAUCE - 6 decent chicken pieces soaked in rich thick creamy BBQ sauce is a perfect starter for a complete good meal. 

ARRABIATA PASTA - This is the red sauce pasta which tasted too good. Rich in spices and aroma with a spicy yet tangy flavour the pasta tasted amazing. 

HAWAIIAN PIZZA - This was a blend of spicy and sweet. Had chilli and to complement it, it had pineapple slices, with small slices of chicken salami and ample amount of cheese. We liked this as well. 

Not to forget about their amazing hospitality. And also this place is very pocket friendly. Worth a visit.

In the thirst of trying out new places, I reached here too with my friend and was not disappointed at all. Their decor is neat and soothing, not too fancy but suiting the ambiance perfectly.

A very promising new cafe with great ambience and service. We had Chicken Kimchi Salad, Penne Pasta in Rose sauce and BBQ Chicken pizza. The pasta dish was absolutely delicious! The pizza was also pretty good. The salad was yummy too but the pasta was definitely the winner. 

Definitely check this place out if you want a comfortable and peaceful place to chill with your friends rather than your typical over-crowded cafes.

Visited this place just for a casual lazy brunch on a winter afternoon.
Location- On the main road of Jodhpur Park, watch out for a red dot near Selimpur stoppage!
Ambience- Pretty decent seating arrangements mainly chairs but there is a lavish couch too! The place was empty so peaceful only, good music was a turn on!¬†
Decor- Classy with few frames, hanging lights and false creepers & flowers.
Food- 1. Cafe Latte - moderate
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†2. Pepper Fish- Good quantity, moderate taste, fried small fish bites with capsicum and onion.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†3. Chicken Bruschetta - Very tasty! Worth a try.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†4. Cheese cake- Mango flavour it was. So soft and so fresh. Loved it.
The staffs were young and energetic and were very helpful and courteous, constantly asking for betterments, feedbacks etc. Would love to visit again. Pocket pinch was also reasonable.

Firstly the quantity to price ratio is amazing. Both the quantity and quality is good. Service is good. This place has good potential. Its pretty spacious as well. You can hang out in large numbers. 

What I ordered : 

Aglio Olio pasta in Rose sauce - a little dry but good in taste. 

Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce - pretty tasty and good sized portions. 

Mango shake - good in taste. 

Its a good place to visit. Its worth the money.

We had a visit here this evening, the Cafe is very easy to locate, just opposite to Carmel High school! The interior is quite nice, there is one guy who took our orders, served them to us and constantly made sure that we liked the dishes, kudos to him for being so patient with our boisterous group! üëç

Now the food, we had ordered crispy fried chicken, chicken 65 and crispy chilly mushroom, though I'm not a big fan of mushroom I just loved their preparation, crispy fried chicken was also tasty but chicken 65 was that one dish which I loved the most, it had a beautiful tangy after taste which really impressed me! All the starters we ordered were garnished and presented in the same manner but tasted differently. Lastly we had ordered Lamb chop sizzler, the lamb was nicely cooked and tasted delicious, so did the mashed potato and vegetables! The prices are very pocket friendly, our bill was merely Rs 746. They gave us each a membership card as well with which can avail a discount next time, so that's a cherry on the rop! üòä

lastly, they kept my headphones secured which I had left in a hurry and returned them when I went back later so for that a full 5! Had an awesome overall experience, would surely come again!

We opted for some Virgin Mojito which was the first refreshment drink we ordered.It was nice and I liked the taste and had some nice virgin Mojito after a long time.
We ordered for Crispy Chicken wings which was really tasty and the sauce was great in taste with garlic flavoured. It was more on the spicy side so I enjoyed it more.
The konjee lamb was something very crispy with capsicums and I liked the taste and the crispyness.It greater great .
Next we ordered for some BBW chicken pizza.That was delicious!The super thin crust and the cheesyness of the cheese spread was awesome.It was great i could rather say!
The lamb Chap Sizzlers were something that is the special dish from this place.The Lamb chap and the mashed potatoes along with some boiled vegetables were really tasty .

A wonderful place not only for friends to hangout but also for family as well. Located at the heart of Jodhpur Park right opposite to Selimpur Bus Stand,Roasted Beans caters both continental as well as chinese delicacies,decoration being quite sober and sophisticated. Had ordered:
Beverages: 
Virgin Mojito,Peach Mojito and Red Bull Passion Wedding. Each of them was refreshing. But among the all I absolutely loved the Red Bull Passion Wedding. It was just awesome.
Starters:
Crispy Chicken Wings- loved it. It chicken was juicy and the sauce was too yummy.
Konjee Lamb- crispy lamb tossed in a beautiful rich sauce. It was just yumm. Superb.
Main Course: 
Well one of my friends orders BBQ Pizza from which i sampled only one piece and it tasted heavenly. Thin crust pizza with loads of cheese and chicken. Awesome. Recommended.
I loved the Traditional Rice Mix which i ordered. The rice was beautifully cooked. Along with the rice i had Hot Garlic Chicken and it was absolutely delicious. I loved each and everything about this cafe cum restaurant. Ambience of the place was nice, the staffs were friendly and last but not the least, the food was great.

First of all, it's very easy to locate the cafe, as it is on the main road.

Only a few months since it's inception, this cafe has a decent decor with nice lighting and lively music playing, which enhances the ambience. The staff is very nice and friendly. 

The choco cappuccino was good. And the Veg Au Gratin was loaded with cheese and was really filling and tasty. Good food. Hoping to come back again!

Stopped here for some coffee today. We had cappuccino, cafe latte, fish n chips, lamb chop sizzler and sizzling brownie with ice-cream & hot chocolate.

Food was¬†good and reasonably priced. Fish fries, served with french fries & white sauce were really delicious. But we didn't like that lamb chop sizzler & could not eat that. Coffee & brownie were okay. The staffs were wonderful and friendly. The place is quite spacious & comforting.

Good experience barring that lamb chop sizzler. Nice place to relax and spend time with friends.

A new restaurant for all the foodies out there.
Located in jodhpur park, just on top of the BANK OF INDIA is this cafe cum restaurant.
We visited this restaurant in the evening and it was almost empty with one table occupied.

This place is quite spacious with good and comfortable interiors.

Okay! So for food
We ordered
1) CHICKEN POPCORN WITH MUSTARD MAYO
AND
2) LAMB CHOP STEAK

The chicken popcorn was quite basic but was very tasty.
Would go absolutely well with a steaming cup of coffee.

The only complain i had was with the LAMB CHOP STEAK.
Before ordering i asked them, whether it would take time for them to serve it bcoz it is lamb and lamb takes time in cooking. They said it would take them 10 mins.

We waited for almost 20 mins and then the waiter was like, ma'am it would take 10 mins more.

Though the waiter was polite and courteous, but still 30 mins was too much for a dish. That too it was not cooked properly and was very much hard to tear even after waiting for 30 mins.
The steak had sauted veggies along with 4 big pieces of meat.
Though the dish was good, but the meat which is the main ingredient was not well cooked.
Still, i appreciate their effort and i am looking forward to try out their other dishes.

Ordered: Kitkat shake, Oreo shake, Brownie Shake. Pepper fish, Conji lamb & Roasted beans special chicken! 
All the shakes were excellent, but the brownie shake was out of the world! One must must must have the Pepper Fish here if not anything else! 
New place and soon going to be the best in the area if they maintain this quality and standard! 
Service: 100/100. Thanks to Mr. Sayon, he took special care of every item we ordered and made sure we were comfortable and enjoying!!!
This is going to be my most visited place now!

Roasted beans like it's name it spreads aroma of food everywhere.
Location: Near Selimpur at the Hi-Tech animation academy building.
Foods were served hot and mouth watering.Went on my birthday & they made it special.
Brownie shake was sooo yummylicious chocolatey.
We also order crispy chilli baby corn- perfeclty cooked tossed in sauce.
Meat Lovers Pizza- what I loved is they offer a large pizza at a pocket friendly price with extra cheese but the pizza base should be little bit softer n pls add some pizza sauce to it.Otherwise quantity of cheese n toppings were too good.
Staffs were well trained they keep asking us how is the food.Ambience was good.

Secondly we ordered plenty of things:
A) Crispy fried mushroom and babycorn: The quantity was bit less, but the taste was amazing.
B) Mocktails: The taste of the mocktails were not at all good. But the service boys were well mannered and they changed the mocktails.
C) Veg Pizza: The pizza was too good we all loved it.
D) Pepper fish: This is the item i liked the most, the quality and the taste was mouth watering. I loved it. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
E) Veg penne pasta with white sauce: This was good too. I liked the garlic bread more which was on the top of the pasta.
F) Spagetti aglio olio non veg pasta: it was tasty too.

So overall i had an amazing time here. Will love you visit it again n again. A must must visit for all. Finally after the cheque, they provided some discount coupons too. Great cafe. Thumbs up üëçüëçüëç

I visited this place once and have had a very mixed experience here. An apartment has been turned into a restaurant here with sufficient seating areas. The food spread is very impressive; you will literallybe spoilt for choice.¬† We tried the Grilled Fish in lemon butter sauce and Chicken Ala king. Both the dishes tasted good, but the portions were pretty less, as compared to the prices. The staff sometimes is not too well behaved. Otherwise the place is pretty decent. They, however, do not accept cards as advertised on their Zomato page (which is misleading).

Cozy place with great ambience.
Pocket pinch isn't so high.
Cordial staffs.
Commendable Service.
I went there with 3 other friends of mine...we ordered Chicken club Sandwich, chicken 65 and Brownie shake.
Chicken club Sandwich tastes great and fresh with perfect stuffings of egg and chicken in it.
Chicken 65 as a starter was well prepared and tastes good.
Brownie shake was refreshing.
Overall great experience.

Been there recently. Of all dishes, the fish and chips stole my heart. A modified version of fish fry, it is juicy, hot and mouthwatering. And the blueberry cheesecake! Though I always find the syrup above the pastry little too sweet, the cream and the lower crust perfectly matched the taste. Thai gree
n curry was well prepared, well decorated and light on your stomach. I found fish Florentine a bit off the taste, maybe because my bengali taste buds always crave for spices! The chicken wings in barbeque sauce is something I have read about in previous zomato reviews, but I found the chicken a bit undercooked though the flavour was very good.
Not to forget the very soothing green apple mojito.
This place can really boast of its decors and ambience. And the friendly and courteous staff! Thank you guys! 
For such a great place, choice of music could have been better and more diverse.

This cafe is located in Selimpur, near the four cross road at Jadavpur Thana just opposite to the petrol pump. The entrance might disappoint you but once you enter you will see a pretty spacious place with beautiful decor, gives a homely feeling. It has a blackboard where the special menu for the day is mentioned. I went there with a couple of friends to have dinner. 
Here's what I had :
1. Devil's own - this is a thick chocolate brownie shake with rich flavours and is quite filling. 
2. Orange mojito- mojito with a typical orangish flavour to start a good meal.
3. Green Apple Mojito - This one's my favourite and I need a green apple mojito with my meal to sip off till the end. 
4. Crispy chicken wings - chicken wings barbequed till reddish brown, crispy and soft in taste. 
5. Konjee lamb - it has rubbery but easily tearable lamb pieces fried in a perfect manner to get that salty and spicy taste. 
6. Fish and chips - fish and chips is an all time favourite. The soft fish with the crispy fried covering was great to taste. 
7. Lamb chop sizzler - Sizzlers are love, that too with lamb chops. It is served with flavoured rice and veggies. 
8. Chicken Ala king - this dish has chunks of chicken with loads of cheese and veggies , tastes heavenly. 
9. Fish Florentine - A fishy affair, presentation is same as that of chicken ala king but tastes equally good. 
10. Thai green curry - rice and thick Thai green curry with small pieces of chicken is perfect for a delectable meal.
11. Roasted beans' special pork chop sizzler- pork Sizzlers are my favourite and the sizzler pork with the saucy flavour, together with rice and veggies was amazing. 
12. Cheese cake - Desserts are a must and so is cheesecake. Blueberry cheesecake tastes even better with their special touch to it. 
This new cafe is a must try for everyone who haven't tried it yet. The prices are reasonable ranging from 120-270/300 max. The ambience is really attractive, the food tastes great and the service is good too.

You guys have already noticed this place while crossing the Jodhpur Park more... I'm sure about that... The classy glowing monogram in red n black is attracting everyone's eyes... One will think the place to be cozy as the approch lane is very narrow... But once you will get inside the cafe in the first floor... You will found it to be very spacious... The place is Beautifully decorated... Ambience is great too... Staffs are well behaved and the service is on the quicker side...

Now coming to the food and drinks...

We tried their "Devil's Own", "Orange Mojito" & "Green Apple Mojito" from the drinks menu... All were good and refreshing...

In the starters "Crispy Chicken Wings", "Konjee Lamb", "Fish & Chips" are must try form here...

And for the main course you can choose anyone of this... "Lamb Chop Sizzler", "Rosted Bean Special Pork", "Chicken Ala King"...

Last but not the least don't forget to try the "Blueberry Cheesecake" from here... It's just heavenly...

More good news is... The place is very much pocket friendly... So made a visit at the earliest...

Located next to Jodhpur Park Bank of India Branch,this is a newly opened cafe.The Roasted beans glowing logo stands amidst the busy streets ,and it is quite easy to locate. Just that the entrance to the place is kinda dimlighted as it is situated in the 1st floor of a building , but once you are in the bright glowing red circular logo ,reads"Roasted Beans" welcomes you.

WHAT I ORDERED : 

1.ORANGE MOJITO 
2.GREEN APPLE MOJITO
3. DEVIL'S OWN

Totally loved the Orange Mojito and the green apple was something different and tasted well .

4.CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS : Damn, they tasted so good,juicy and less spicy as well.

5.FISH & CHIPS : This is my personal favourite from this place. The fish fillets tasted so good ,specially perfectly fried. 

6.LAMB CHOP SIZZLER : The juicy succulent pieces of lamb and steaming hot sizzler on a chilly november evening would surely take you back to this cafe. Must try .

7.ROASTED BEANS SPECIAL PORK : I have always been a pork lover , and when it comes to pork dishes, I just cannot control. But the pork was too good in taste and quite juicy as well. Just that it was too hard to cut it into pieces, I personally think the pork should be cooked to bit soft. 

8.CHICKEN ALA KING : Being a continental dish ,cheese is the only which made this dish too good. Do try .

9.FISH FLORENTINE : Fish baked in cheese and served in a glass tray , I just kept digging onto the cheese. Yumm !!

10.THAI GREEN CURRY : The bright green colour of the thai curry is quite appealing and will make you have it ,but the taste was good. Salty and sweet types. 

11.BLUBERRY  CHEESECAKE : Can anything be more perfect than a bluberry cheesecake to end the meal ? I guess no. Made out of bluberry concentrate ,this was a perfect ending to the meal. Do try.

Overall the price is very reasonable ,food is quite good, interiors is pretty homely ,and the service was good as well. Must visit

The place actually looks a bit smaller on Zomato than it really is. Can comfortably accommodate around 25-30 people. Well decorated and compact arrangement.
Good ambiance. Very much pleased with the service - fast and attentive staffs.
Food was equally impressive. Personal suggestions would be Crispy Chicken Wings/Fish & Chips from the starters and Chicken Ala King/Green Thai Curry from the main course.
Both orange and green apple mojitos were well-made. Devil's Own Shake - which is cold coffee serves with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, choco chips and a choco stick - was good enough.
Super impressed with the main food resulted in a bit of disappointment for the cheesecake when my hopes got too high. Not rating 5 only for this one.

A perfect place to grab a mug of Brownie Shake on a chilly winter evening or catch up with friends over a Devil's Own and Green Apple Mojito. It is located in Gariahat Road, Near Bank of India, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata.

The ambiance of this place is great. The staff is very polite and friendly. The food is pretty average but that's not what this place is about. It's completely about ambiance.¬†

Roasted Beans's menu is mostly¬† Italian, Continental, Chinese with plenty of¬† Salad, Sandwiches, Bruscehetta, Crostini, Sizzler and Pasta to choose from. They also have a grill menu like sizzler to satiate your meat cravings. And if you cannot decide, just go for one of their Thin Crust Pizza or Risotto. The menu boasts of a range of mock-tails, shakes and smoothies and hot tea for the health-conscious as well.

                    Among the drinks, I tried two drinks - Devil's Own and Green Apple Mojito. Both were chilled and equally refreshing. But the Devil's Own was actually tasted amazing.

                    The starters were served even before we had finished half of the drinks. In starters and main course we had Crispy Chicken Wings, Fish & Chips, Chicken Ala King, Fish Florentine and Thai Green Curry.

                    It's difficult to choose which was the best among the starters and main course foods, since each of them were exceptional. However, I felt Crispy Chicken Wings and Fish Florentine to be slightly better than the best. And their Fish & Chips and Chicken Ala King were very good. It tasted heaven.

And the Cheese Cake was excellent and looks truly heaven.

                    Overall, it was good tasty food, good service price is appropriate full points for this place.I can't explain how awesome all of them were. I will definitely visit this place sometime soon and try the other dishes on the menu.

Roasted Beans is a cute little cafe at Jodhpur Park. The interiors have a nice cost feeling to it and are beautifully decorated with pretty lights and green creepers. The food and beverages are really good in quality and quantity. I had gone with the FoodZpah team and we had ordered an array of delicious dishes. Our menu consisted of Devil's Own(kind of a cold coffee), Orange Mojito, Green Apple Mojito, Crispy Chicken Wings in Barbeque Sauce, Konjee Crispy Lamb, Fish and Chips, Pork Sizzler, Lamb Sizzler, Roasted Beans Special Pork, Chicken Ala King, Fish Florentine, Thai Green Curry and Cheesecake. More or less every dish tasted amazing. The prices are reasonable and that's a big plus point. I have  given it a score it a 4.5 because there's always scope for improvement and also because I personally didn't like the fish preparation that much. Will definitely visit this Cafe again!

Already home to numerous Cafe's, jodhpur Park has managed to welcome another gem and this place is already striking the right chords in a very short span of time! 

Located opposite to the jodhpur Park petrol pump, finding this place is quite a cake Walk! Don't get too disappointed with the passage way that leads to this place, once you enter, you are bound to feel at ease with the lovely decor, interiors and the seating arrangement! 

The dishes are reasonably priced and are extremely pocket friendly! The behavior and service of the staff were pretty commendable! 

Now coming to the food, i really liked their beverages, namely the devil's own which was extremely well presented, the orange mojito was very refreshing and well prepared and the green apple mojito which was quite well prepared! 

The starters were praiseworthy and extremely well prepared! We tried the crispy chicken wings which to be honest is something which you shouldn't miss over here, the konjee lamb which comes in generous proportions and an unparalleled taste and the classic fish and chips! The starters completely won me over! 

The main course consisted of Lamb chop sizzler which was quite reasonably priced and tasted well, the chicken ala kiev which was quite delectable and the Thai green curry which was praiseworthy! 
For desert's you should definitely order their cheese cake! 
This place offers an elaborate menu and you would be spoilt for choices definitely! Definitely coming back to this place again!

Located just opposite to the selimpur petrol pump. 
It has a bright red hoarding for which it's easily noticeable. 
It's on the first floor of the building. 
Interior is pretty much homely, decorated well. Comfortable. 
For drinks we ordered orange mojito, green apple mojito, devil's own. Mojitos were refreshing. 
Starters included crispy chicken wings ( must try) , fish and chips. The fish fillets were pretty thick and soft. Should try definitely. 

Mains we're :- 
Lamb chop sizzler, roasted beans special pork, chicken ala king, Thai green curry. 
The pork could've been more tender. Otherwise everything was delicious. 

I had the blueberry cheesecake for dessert. And it was amazing. Light fluffy cream cheese filling and crumble too was fluffy.

I was superhappy to discover this newly opened cafe near my locality. Its only been 25days that they have started this cafe and its already a hit. Located just opposite to the selimpur petrol pump, this kitchen serves some amazing preperations. The first thing that i was super excited about was their continental dishes served at such a pocket friendly price! 
We order crispy chilli babycorn, Fish florentine and fish steak sizzler and the total bill was only Rs 630 for two! 
The crispy chilli babycorn was served in a hot pan and it was perfectly cooked and tasted good.
The fish florentine was something that i tasted for the first time. The baked fish with cheese and spinach was a great treat to the tongue. Cheese and fish lovers definitely give it a try! It is unique. 
And fish steak sizzler was served with vegetables and fried potato wedges. The quality of the fish was very good. It was very soft and juicy and had a distinct taste. 
Overall i very much loved their food. Staff members are caring and cordial. Interior is okayish but decent.

A brand new place(one month old)in the heart of Jodhpur park, Kolkata situated on the 1st floor of BOI is sure to amaze you with it's uniqueness.
The moment you enter this place you'll get a homely feeling. There's a wooden bench that can't be missed by any photoholic. Walls decorated with artificial leaves and lights will give you good vibes.
Spacious? Yes.
Friendly staff? Yes.
Good food? Yes.
We had ordered Cappuccino and cafe mocha as beverages.
Cappuccino wasn't that hot by the time we decided to take its taste. It was so nice of their staff to exchange the cup with another. Thank you once again for that!
Chilly baby corn was YUM!
But the Konjee Lamb swiped right into my heart. Soft, hot and delicious.
Pizza came on a crust that we could trust. It was perfect!
Quantity and quality? Superb.
Bruschetta made my tummy happy. Creamy, gooey and yummy to bits!! Loved the item.
Keep growing! Thumbs up for the place.üëç

I don't have much of a complain about the food or service but when you are saying that cash and cards are accepted then you should make sure you have the card machines at your disposal. This is not expected that you don't have the card machine when you advertise for the same on Zomato. Very disappointed at this

This is a new addition to the wonderful cafes in South Kolkata. Situated in a convenient location, hardly 100mts from Jadavpur Thana, this is a cozy place to enjoy your coffee with some pretty interesting side menus. I took a cappuccino and my friend ordered a cold coffee named 'Devil's Own' served in a tall glass with ice cream and a generous amount of chocolate sauce. We also ordered chicken nachos, which was perfectly cooked and loaded with chicken, mushrooms, and zucchinis. Their portions easily serves two persons.
Talking about the service, a bunch of young, energetic guys will welcome you and are always enthusiastic to help you chose from the menu and suggesting their special daily dishes.
The cafe has a a very cozy and interesting decor, with green creepers and black board with today's special menu mentioned.
A place where you would want to visit again.

Those who follow me regularly know how I @am drawn towards cafe. When I spotted this cafe, I felt the need to go there and test, and so I went. I was pleasantly surprised to see the decore - beautiful green creepers rendering a pleasant feeling. The whole restaurant is divided into two sections - one having narrow chairs, facing the beverage counter - just like a typical cafe. The other is bigger with  comfortable sofas, for dining purpose.
The owner is a beautiful Bengali lady named Baishali. I have partiality towards lady entrepreneurs, on top of it she is Bengali, so I hoped my experience would be memorable.

She personally checks into the patrons‚Äô needs. And the staff are young enthusiastic boys who would try their best to help you. 
After discussing with the staff, I chose kitkat cappuccino for its novelty. I then chose chicken in barbecue sauce to be parcelled. On request, I chose mushroom duplex to be eaten on table. 
Food arrived pretty soon. Mushroom
Duplex is the right amount of fry, not too hard or crispy. The coffee was different from ordinary coffees that we daily consume. It relieved the weariness that i was feeling.
The parcel I took home. The taste of the food was perfect. The right amount of juiciness and crispiness. The only point - the parcel was not packed properly. Thank God that I had not ordered any curry thing otherwise it would have been very messy. Otherwise lovely experience.


No parking space. Price pocket friendly.

I visited this cafe on 31st Oct'17..it is located in selimpur. Cafe has pleasant decor and it has a huge seating arrangement..good music playing at background. We ordered chicken hakka noodles and fish finger. Noodles tasted good n quantity was sufficient for two..bt what I liked the most was fish fingers. It tasted so awesome.. quality and texture was so perfect..they served with french fries and Mayo dip. Staff was courteous.. ambience was also good bt only drawback I would say that as it opened few days back they didn't start the card payment facility. Overall a cool cafe joint with pocket friendly dishes..where u want to visit it frequently.

Located immediately next to the Jodhpur Park Bank of India branch, this very hard to miss newly opened place  has everything cafe goers should love. Easy to find, not so flashy, not too crowded and aesthetically pleasing, this is a must visit place if you're looking for good food at great prices with extremely  polite staff.  The seating capacity is decent with very balanced lighting for the perfect ambience, the interiors have a cozy feel and the service is amazing with a few young jovial guys who are excellent conversationalists. Food quality is really good with balanced taste served in acceptable  proportions with the broadest smiles. Happy hours are very pockeet friendly and the varieties are not up for compromise. All in all, this seems to be a really promising cafe in a prime location that ticks all the right boxes that will make you go back for moee.

This place is well located just beside BOI Jhodpur park branch. I went to this newly opened cafe today with my friend. At that time the cafe was almost empty. The decor is very pretty and charming. We ordered Choco cappuccino, Darjeeling tea and French fries. I just love the taste of Choco cappuccino. Darjeeling tea was also good. They served the hot and fresh French fries but honestly I am very disappointed with that because the quantity was very small. Later we ordered Crispy chilli baby corn which are very tasty and the portions are enough for two. What we love the most is that the Staffs are very friendly and well behaved. Service is also very swift. The prices are very reasonable and pocket friendly. They don't charge anything extra beside food charges. Overall experience is good and would love to visit this place again.üòäüòä

The staff there are so friendly and welcoming. And about the food, my friend and I tried The Brownie Shake, Chicken Steak Sizzler, and Chicken Barbecue Pizza.
Honestly, the presentation of the Brownie Shake won my heart. It also tasted amazing.
The sizzler was good too.
But the pizza is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 8 slices. Very filling.
Approx 700/- for two. Try this place. You won't regret it.

We ordered for üçï and roast üêî and both were awesome. The pizza was a thin crust with adequate cheese and the chicken was succelent.
