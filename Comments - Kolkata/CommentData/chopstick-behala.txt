I have been here multiple times. I have also ordered online many times. It's completely value for money. Quantity of foods is excellent. Quality is also very good. A huge variety is available on shredded chicken. In starters crispy chilly baby corn and potato tastes excellent. Interior is intimidating. The price of dishes is huge advantage for them. I would like to give it a 5 star but their entrance is not up to the mark. And also this is the only place I have been where veg Manchurian is more spicy than schezwan chicken.
Thank you

Chopstick is located in Parnasree, Behala opposite to the outlet of Hao Chi inside a very narrow lane. It is one of the most popular restaurants of the area as it provides food at a very cheap rate. The restaurant is quite small and would be very unsuitable if you have a large group. We had Drums of Heaven and Konjee Crispy Lamb for starters. Both the dishes were very well prepared. I loved the lamb and it was very crispy as the name suggests. The Drums of Heaven had 5 pieces. Since we were a group of 6 people, we had requested the waiter to give 6 pieces and adjust the amount likewise to which he agreed. But when the food arrived, we were surprised that there were 5 pieces only. We had Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Mixed Fried Rice for main dish along with Lemon Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. The main dishes were of sufficient quantity and would easily suffice a couple of people. The Kung Pao Chicken dish was good as well but the Lemon Chicken let us down. It tasted under prepared and was hardly eatable when the food became cold. The staff also did not fill our glasses with water when we arrived at the restaurant. As a whole, I felt the waiters and their serving were very negligent. The food was at par with the cost and it was not a good experience overall.

Frankly I was very specific before I placed my order from here. So took help from zomato and some positive reviews guide my order. I would say in this price bracket they did a very good job. Lamb chili in black bean sauce and barbeque chicken was good , very good. Fried rice is little bit party spoiler. Anyways overall I am satisfied and will definitely order from there . Can't comment on the decor or location bcz never been there personally. Good job guys.

This is a place where you can stop by with your friends even if you have a limited budget. Food quantity is exceptionally good along with a mouth watering taste.. Only drawback is their service is pretty slow since they do a lots of home delivery.. But if you are in a budget still want to experience good food, this place you must try..

Being just at 1 minute walking distance from my house , this is THE restaurant that satisfies my taste buds when I'm hungry for some Chinese Delicacy !
First , the Positive Points :-
1) Food Quality is good ! A single plate of Fried Rice can serve two adults easily ! Hence the quantity is good as well ! The taste of the items are excellent as well .
2) The rates are highly affordable !
3) Though we mostly order home but I know that the food serving time is good too ! 
4) FREE HOME DELIVERY !
Now , the Negative Points :-
1) The location :- It's located behind a building and not really noticeable for a person coming for the first time !
2) The Eating Area / Restaurant :- It's really small . I guess , there are just 5-6 four seater tables - and that's it !
Ultimately, this is a GREAT restaurant for ordering home ! Sitting & eating here isn't everyone's cup of tea .
I easily recommend this restaurant to each and everyone living within its FREE DELIVERY RADIUS.

This small eatery near Parnasree Lake is best suited for takeaway since the place is cramped and a little dingy. 
But the food is very tasty with respect to the prices they charge. 
Although their Thukpa is thick like gravy Chow and not a broth , I still love to order it simply because of the lip-smacking gravy. They put ample veggies and chicken in it. 
Some of the chicken dishes and the crispy konjee lamb is good, but lamb and pork can be a little chewy and not-so-fresh at times. 
The vegetables in barbecue sauce was too oily.
Overall a good bet if you don't wanna spend much on a quick dinner.

The place is good, with a proper restaurant-type ambience. I ordered schezwan chicken rice for taking it as parcel. The amount provided by the restaurant was ample according to its price. The taste was very bad as the real taste of schezwan dishes do not tend to be like this. Moreover, It was over spicy and was definitely not up to the mark.

This place in just in the lane beside parnashree police station.Go there and ask anyone and they will show u the way. Small eatery ; dimly lit; fair ambience defines this place's atmosphere.Now coming to the food.We ordered the chopstick special non veg hakka noodles and lemon chicken. The food in one word was marvellous in terms of  both quantity and quality.The lemon chicken was well cooked and tasted good(I loved it). Coming to the noodles; it was one of the finest I've had in Kolkata and I'm not exaggerating.It was smoky ; spicy and stuffed with Chicken, prawn and loads and loads of vegetables of different variety which i found unique and commendable.This place is a must visit for food lovers .Go for it.

A small restro in Behala Parnashree with good ambience & AC. Had their Mixed Fried Rice which was very tasty & had equal proportions of egg, chicken & prawn. I loved the smoky flavour in their fried rice. Next I had Mixed Gravy Chowmein which was also very good. Not too sticky gravy & large chunks of chicken was there. Noodles part had a portion of fried crispy noodle which I liked. Along with two main course dish we had Mandarin chicken which I liked most. Totally loveable. Very fine slices of carrot & capsicum enhanced the taste of sweet & sour gravy. It comes with six big chunks of chicken. Overall I love their food & their management people was really good & helpful. Highly recomended✌✌

Bt still the quantity, the quality of the Momo shredded lamb, one chicken preparation which I m confused with the name.. And also the rice n noodles.. Which will pull you there again And again. I use to go there from my college days. And the best part is the price are still the same.

One of the disadvantages of this place is the entrance of the place is very dirty and needs to be cleaned up.. The food here is not only cheap but also really tasty. We had tried BBQ chicken which was spicy and tasty.. Jst the perfect starters. Then we hd Chicken Hakka Noodles.. Not the best we hd bt definitely good nd tasty it was.. Schezwan Fish ws very good nd the fish was soft, tender nd juicy.. The best part ws the bill 295₹! Lookin forward to go there again soon.. Atleast my fiancee ws not totally wrng bout this place...

Went here today for a light evening snack after a good movie . Had no information regarding the restaurant previously , my friends told me that you get good food at cheap prices so decided to give it a go .

On entering the restaurant you'll find the place to be very shabby and it's like you are entering the kitchen rather than the restaurant . But after entering the restaurant everything seems normal again . Ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Schezwan  Chicken , food was good but I found the Schezwan Chicken to be a bit too spicy but it was okay . Service was fast and the food was cheap.

Came out with a happy stomach and a happy heart ! 😊

Well this is an interesting review , which helps you  To order ? Or Not.

Food - 👍🏻 😶
Service- 👍🏻🤔
Cleanliness- 👍🏻😑
Value for money - 👍🏻👍🏻🙄
 
Well chopstick is a old Para Chinese joint of Parnashree area , and Haochi is the relatively new entry.
Both serves food of average Quality, Hey as I always say - "you get what you pay for".Cheap and ok for cheap home delivery when you have nothing else around.  
Chopstick and Haochi both are almost same on food quality and standard wise so its a close finish between the two , may be a dead heat.
Happy eating 😎

Ordered chicken garlic fired rice ( rs. 105) mixed garlic fired rice(rs. 115) which always taste awesome and quantity is enough for two if you consider avg. amount for each person.

Mandarin chicken( rs.115) is on the sweeter side, close to sweet garlic chicken, adequate quantity for 2.

Chilli prawn (rs 155) tasted good h,owever there were only 5 pieces of prawn which i think is an odd no. To be in a dish which costs this much and also when the chicken side has 8 pieces. So that's a big let down. So I'm gonna count the prawns next time after enquiring about the correct no. they provide. The gravy is also not adequate as you can see from the pic.
All this came to 500 total. They charge rs.5 for 1 plastic container which is normal.
Overall good experience

Well having heard about the place from my friends I decided to give it a try. Located near parnashree bus stand its hard to locate if you aren't well acquainted with the place. The food here is cheap but tasty. These what I tried -
1. Bbq chicken- spicy and tasty perfect for starters.
2. Chicken fried rice - not exactly like the rice sold at other Chinese restaurant but it was tasty
3. Schwann fish-  soft fish and gravy.
The bill was 295₹ which was the best part!
Only disadvantage is the entrance of the place is very dirty and needs to be cleaned up.

This is a very small and budget friendly restaurent just opposite behala parnasree bus stand. The interor space is very small and honestly the quality of the food is not up to the mark. The gravy noodles was a bit okayish but the chop stick special noodles was jst something i won't try again. The service was good overall and u can come here if u are not willing to spend big money on ur lunch or dinner. Also there is no provision for payment with card or paytm
Special attraction -
1) Dragon chicken
2) lamb in hot garlic sauce
This items were  awsm compared to the other dishes.. and you should try it...

It was a pleasant surprise to have ordered and tasted the food from this restraunt.Never thought that a restraunt of this type I.e small and catering to primarily local residents, can offer such uniquely tasty food. I emphasise on the word UNIQUE.
Ordered online from this restraunt for Chicken Mala Noodles, thus have no idea about service quality and interiors.Food was delivered in paper box as would any small restraunt or take away counter would do. The portion size was adequate for two and tasted spicy , as spicy as usage of chilli paste would do. But other ingredients were balanced appropriately thus did not burn up the insides of the mouth.Loved the unique taste of the food.
All menu prices are inclusive of taxes .GREAT.

Chopstick, the popular local Chinese eatery in my neighborhood offers delicious food at affordable prices!👍

Just a short walk from the bus stand, the place is tucked at the end of a narrow lane inside the busy Parnasree market place. Since it's located just at a stone's throw from my apartment, a home delivery often seems to be an excellent hassle free option, (lazy I am 😸) one phonecall and the food reaches the table within about 30 minutes. And with no other nearby eateries unwaveringly offering the same level of food and prompt service, Chopstick undeniably remains a local favorite.✌

Drums of Heaven, Chicken Lollipops, Dry Chilli Chicken, Lemon Garlic Rice (sans soy sauce) are some of the best they make and also let you customize the way you like. Portions are generous and a meal for two costing a mere 300-400 bucks (tax included), is worth a deal! 😸

Sometimes we find great experiences from the most unexpected places. A small joint , ran by 3-4 ppl , it is perhaps one of the most  pocket friendly and delicious food joint in Kolkata. Visually very average looking place but they make sure that their foods do all the bidding . Its my/ our obvious choice for any day's casual lunch. Comprising with various varieties of Chinese foods,  it ticks all the boxes generally what every1 looks in a food ... Its pocket friendly , great quantity and above average quality and tastes pretty well. My recommendation Shredded chicken, Hunan fish, Pan fried fish and Rice dishes . Only thing in my opinion they can change is their noodles..  sometyms they  are pretty thick....

The place is located in parnashree bazar area, a little difficult to locate as the entrance of the restaurant is from behind another store and only a board with chopstick written on it marking it's presence. A small restaurant with 5tables, each with 4people accommodation. The place is fine in decoration but never ever visit the loo...it's one of its kind...filthy, dirty,  unhygienic. The staffs are well behaved and will help one in ordering food. We ordered a starter dish of fish and another of lamb. Both well cooked, though I felt a slight smell in the fish. Then we went on to mixed fried rice and a chicken side dish. The fried rice quantity was fine for one normal adult. The chicken side dish was good. The amazing thing about this restaurant is its price. It's very low and will go very easy on your pocket. A perfect for treating a group of 17-18 friends with lunch or dinner. The over-all quality of food is not extraordinary but suits the cost. One time visit is fine but definitely not the one to look out for types in the city.

By far the best restaurant in Parnasree. Located at a stone's throw from my place it is like a family restaurant to me. The food they serve is good,nothing special though. The quantity of food served is tremendous. That is surely appreciable. It is a small restaurant with 4 tables only so one would prefer a takeaway. Recently I had tried their Drums of Heaven,Mixed Hakka Noodles, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Schezwan Chicken. The Drums of Heaven were good but nothing compared to the ones served in Hatari. The Noodles were delicious and the quantity served was huge as I had mentioned earlier about the quantity they serve. It gets difficult at times to finish having the food. The Schezwan Chicken was extremely spicy and superbly cooked. A must try dish for everyone. It is a very pocket friendly place and you will often find it filled with students. Highly recommended if you are having a tight budget and are looking for a decent eatery.

This place is gradually lowering its standard. 
Even one year ago, in 200bucks you could get a Mixed Fried Rice and a Chicken dish both of which would taste delicious. 
Now the price has only risen to 220bucks but the quality is getting worse. 
The fragrant, light, fluffy rice have become dark, soya sauce dunked gloop. 
The Gravy noodles is still good. 

If you really want to eat here, try their Mala Chicken. It's really tasty. 

And try their Thukpa. One serving is a whole meal by itself. It's a great dish of a lot of fresh blanched veggies and chicken and noodles in a light bodied soup. Nicely seasoned. There is no spices apart from some chunks of onions, browned garlic, salt and pepper. You can literally savour the distinct flavours of each vegetable. Very filling and wholesome. Try this. I recommend it.

Now, NEVER do a dine in. Never. Because it's a dank, dark place with no light and weird smells. It's crammy with about 3-4tables. 

I personally like the owner, he is a happy little man and greets me sweetly everytime I go to pick up a take away.

One chinese joint that happens to be the asset of Behala, amidst the broken roads and despair condition. In addition, the home delivery service makes them the giant in the chinese arena. The food is value for money. Must not say, the best chinese i have ever had, but the best Dragon Chicken i have surely had at a miminal price of just 120 bucks. 

I endorse this awesome budget friendly place for any small get together parties, birthdays organised on a short notice. 

Note: Every item = 2 people

I ordered from chopstick through swiggy. First of all the quality of the food was brilliant. We ordered for chicken fried rice, noodles and chilli chicken since we wanted a simple dinner. Chopstick didn't disappoint us with anything be it quality, service or hygiene. The food was more than enough for 5 of us. Also delivery was well within 20 mins which was completely unexpected since deliveries generally take time. Thanks to chopstick and swiggy for that.

Nice chinese food at very affordable price. The food is awesome. It is one of the best chinese in Behala area.
The food was very good. I tried mixed fried rice, five spice falovour chicken, chilli chicken dry, pan fried fish, pan fried prawn and lots more. Every dish was awesome. The price is very afforable.
But the dinning place is not good. The place is suffocating, though they have ac. Though the staffs were good enough. Take away is the best option. It may be difficult for you to locate the restaurant, if you dont know the place good. They have free delivery option in parnashree area.
Recomendation: pan fried fish, mixed fried rice, five spice flavour chicken, dry chilli chicken, pan fried momo.

Saw this restaurant in zomato and thought of ordering food as this is very close to my home. Very small restaurant which has maybe a seating arrangement for only about 20 people or so. So its better to get the food delivered rather than dining there. I order mixed hakka noodles, mixed noodles gravy and schezuan chicken. The amount of food was fairly good. Liked the chicken which was just the way I wanted. Mixed hakka noodles was good too. The salt in the gravy noodles was a little less. Fairly a good experience. Will order again.

The restaurant is a bit too cramped up. This is also at the end of a small alley leading off the main road. There are only 4 tables. So, there is an accommodation crisis. The decor is average. I mean, how much can you decorate such a small restaurant? However, when it comes to food, it scores brownie points. As far as I know, food is the most important aspect of reviewing a restaurant. That is why this place gets a 4.0 rating from me. I always have the schezwan fried rice and the chicken lat-me-kai. The cutlery and crockery aren't bad as well. The restaurant goes easy on the pocket. It fills your tummy more than it empties your pockets, which is a rarity nowadays. If this place had been a little bigger, it would certainly have got a 4.5 rating. Do try and eat here.

I've been going here since childhood I suppose and we get their food through home delivery atleast twice a week.
The ambience is not good enough but it feels like the second home.
And for food lovers, especially Chinese food lovers, the food is awesome. 
You should opt for home delivery if you live in Parnasree or it's adjoining areas.

Although they serve very delicious pork, I highly doubt the freshness of the pork. Pretty cheap and enough in quantity. Having heard loads of Chopstick, experience could have been better. Spacing is pretty tight and lighting is gloomy. But if you are in the mood for cheap Chinese, get your food home delivered from this place.

This is a value for money restaurant. Small place, with one or two staffs. It's in my neighborhood so I'm a frequent visitor out here. They serve good quality chinese dishes at reasonable rates, with great quantity. I like their mixed fried rice and the garlic/chilly/hongkong chicken combo best. The chicken pieces are also quite healthy. Ambiance is pleasant, it's good if you are looking to have a plate of momo in the evening with couple of your friends. I like the way they have decorated the place, sply the lighting. They deliver food till 10/10.30pm. Orders are accepted over phone, during weekends they might not answer your calls due to huge pressure. An extremely popular restaurant in Parnasree area.

A very below average restaurant located in Parnasaree Pally in Behala. Had no choice but to eat from here today as I had a two hours gap between two exams for my university examinations. It was scorching hot and I and my friend needed to find a descent place with air conditioner to eat. We discovered this place through Zomato. The place is located just a few steps from the lane opposite to Parnasaree Police Station.

The entrance to the place is pathetic. One has to go through back of a building where dirty dishes are being washed and pathetic smells welcome you. Moreover, the restaurant is actually a cramped space with just 3-4 tables. It seems they opened the place just for sake of running a restaurant. No decorations, no ambiance and moreover tables are uncomfortably close to the kitchen. Anyways, there was only one air-conditioner but at least it was close enough to us to cool us down.

Food was just about average. We ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles, Crispy Shredded Chicken Dry and Lemon Chicken. They did not get all the items at once but got them one by one as they were prepared. First they got the Crispy Shredded Chicken which was just about average, it was crisp enough though. Then they brought Hakka Noodles which were very tasteless, not properly tossed and lacked flavours. After a few minutes, they finally got us the Lemon Chicken. Though they said that it would have 8 pieces, it actually had much more pieces in it. It was good and the gravy was dense and not runny as I like it.

Service was terribly slow. It took them 35 minutes to serve us. Pricing was cheap as you would expect from these kind of cheap eat restaurants. Billing was manual, no computers inside. Neither the guy had any idea of what we ordered, we had to tell him the items.

Overall a bad place to 'sit down and eat', delivery may be better but still food was not very overwhelming. Moreover bad service adds to the disappointment.

It is a very small n clumsy looking restaurant in Behala and it is almost impossible to find on your own because of its location.

The preparations are pretty good at extremely low prices and I loved the food. The Chicken Noodles and Garlic Chicken was good. But the Sliced Chicken Chilli Pickle Sauce (3rd photo) as suggested by Chopstick staff was too good and I really enjoyed it.

But the place is only good for home delivery or take away food as the ambiance is very bad and you will not want to sit and have food at Chopstick.

Food- 3.5/5

I am a hard core vistor of this small yet one of the best places to dive in. People staying near Behala shpuld definitely visit here. The Porks, Lamb, Fish, Soup and several Chinese dishes are very tongue twisting. And the best part it is very cheap.

If you want great ambiance and decoration this is not the place, but if you are interested in taste of the food then BINGO you got the place you wanted. A superb place for Chinese food lovers. The taste of most of the food item is great. The price is unbelievably low compared to d quantity and quality they provide. Hakka noodles and crispy chicken is one of my favourites. Its very often I visit this place because I stay very near to Chopstick.
The place is very small with dim light. 4 tables with 4 chairs. The ambiance is not what you will be focusing on when you get delicious food.
What to order?
Chicken Steam Momo one of its speacialities
Crispy Chicken, is another food item which is really really good
Chicken Fried Rice, Drums of Heaven, Chilly Prawn Dry. These are the items you should definitely order.

How much to spend?
300 will be more than enough for two person. The quantity they give is much more than other places. 

How to Locate?
Its in Behala Parnashree. Come to Parnashree Bus stand and ask anyone about this place you will reach your destination. 

Last Words:
If you want to enjoy ambiance and the decoration avoid this place. But if you just don't care and want to eat some awesome Chinese food than this is the place for you. You should definitely visit if you wanna eat more and spend less.

4/5  for value of money, taste of food, quality and quantity, and the behaviour of the staffs.

Well, they make good Chinese food. The sitting arrangement is very small and you don't get that privacy as that place is always little crowded. One can always bring food for small parties and get together, won't be disappointed. This is kind of the best you can get in parnasree. They give home delivery too and that service is good enough.

Discovered this joint way back in 2000... Since that time it had been a favoured destination for home delivery of quality Chinese take away. Never disappointed a single time. The mere fact that this placeis inoperation forover 10 years is a testament to it's quality. After travelling to many cities, I still hold my judgement that this is one of the best Chinese joints in India.

the very first chinese outlet that sprang up in my locality...about 12 years ago...still retains its promise of serving delicious chinese cuisine at affordable prices..this is a place i take pride in..being a resident of the area...
the ambiance is comfortable and quite interestingly decorated. with patterned mud wall tiles..dreamy lighting...with a large fish tank fitted in a central cavity on the wall that attracts your attention...right when u step in..
the food..well,i can definitely remark that  its quite above the mark...and delightfully palatable and appetizing..my favourites from the place are Chicken Sweet and Sour..Chilly chicken,Mandarin Chicken..Chicken Hakka Noodles..and of course The Mixed Fried Rice..
The quantity is quite generous..and its clear that this place does not compromise with quality whatsoever....
A great place to drop by for a great chinese experience....

I almost visit this place atleast twice or thrice in a month.The best part about chopstick is its price range.A variety of foods with minimum price.It will cost around 250 - 300 bucks for two.

The pan fried momo is my favourite.Its the best in Kolkata.I have tasted momos from many well known chinese restaurants around the country but Chopstick serves the best according to me.

The mixed hakka noodles,Lat me Kai chicken,Dry chilli chicken,Barbeque chicken,Dragon chicken,five spiced chicken,Chicken lemon coriander soup are my all time favourites.

Although it is not so spacious and a little dingy but still it is worth for what you spend.

This small, dingy, seemingly unhygienic place can leave you wanting for more. At least, that's what happened with me when I went there on a friend's recommendation for the first time. Lots of people might disagree with me and I don't blame them. This is a terrific place if you opt for take-out. However, going out there to have dinner does not have such an appetizing/inviting effect.

The food however takes 'Indian-Chinese-Cuisine' to another level. It is spicy, oily and tingles your taste-buds as if you are having spicy tandoori chicken. The staff is very friendly and takes your preference into consideration. The quantity of food can blow you over. If you think you can have 1 plate of hakka-noodles with a side dish of barbecue chicken (this chicken is highly recommended) alone, think again. Sharing is the best way to approach.

Aaaaaaand, the best part is their prices. 2 people can have their fill within 250 bucks here, and I am being exorbitant. Taxes are inclusive which I guess everybody loves.

Allover, this is a great place if you want very cheap but very tasty food and if lack-of-hygiene doesn't bother you.

Love this place, coz it offers food at low prices and their home delivery is good and fast, i have seen people complaining about the ambience, well u cant simply pay 100 rupees to fill your belly for the food and expect the same as 1000 rupees exp in another restaurant. Dim lighting in the place makes the place great for couples and the manager and waiters are good, so yeah chopstick rocks. Its a saviour for the locals

One of the worst chinese food I ever had... They actually dont know what chinese food is... starting with the ambience... looks like parar chowmin er dokan....  the person who was serving the food doesnot even know how to take the order... I ordered only mixed hakka chowmin... it was pathetic... they forgot to mix prawn.. when I asked them they said sorry.. and came back with microscopic shrimps... the taste of the chowmin was horrible than the parar chowmin dokan ... it was so oily that I felt sick when I came back home... I started vomiting after that...  plzz plzzz never ever try this worst restaurant...yaaaakkkk... FuLL WASTAGE Of Money...

Chopstick is extremely shabby if U r planning a dine - in here... But for a take away it's the best this locality can offer.
When I visited this place I was simply famished so I felt heavens when the food was served.

Ofcorse, the taste was decent...and I feel wt they offer is huge quantity in low price while the quality being quite balanced.

They have a wide variety of starters and the regular chinese dishes.... in all the items the portions are very filling... more than adequate amount.

I have been looking for a place in Parnasree from where I could order chinese home delivery when I want and lo behold, chopstick provided me with an answer. They have always been on time and delivered food even when half of parnasree was flooded during the monsoons. Their home delivery is very good and so are the people behind this joint - very friendly and always willing to go an extra mile. 

I would definitely recommend home delivery from Chopstick.

I use to visit this place each and every weekends.The food is awesome though I don't like their soups.I had tried once and it was not satisfactory.

Apart from that,I have never been disappointed by their foods whether it is Chowmin or rice or thuppa or chopsuey or side dishes,in respect to both quality and quantity.I just love each and every items over here.Also stuffs are very friendly and well behaved. One become well known to them after 2 or 3 visit and they treat them well enough.This restaurant is good for a hangout.

Only space is negative point.Not more than 5 tables are there and you have to wait or come back for your turn.Often there are rush for home delivery and I will suggest to take away than dine in.

DOWNRIGHT ORDINARY CHINESE FOOD!
1.5 out of 5

Chopstick is a very unimpressive and small food outlet. For the Chinese food deprived area of Behala, this is definitely an option worth considering, but not otherwise. The place is more suitable for takeaway rather than a dine-in; as the ambience and service can turn you off. The food is decent and average at best and justifies the cost that it commands. 

Nevertheless, they offer extensive and varied food options. Their veg and non veg starters are lip smacking delights and that is where it ends, though their sizes are such that they will fill your stomach instantly. Some of their popular items include chilli prawn, five spiced chicken, lat Mei kai and chilli baby corn. 

Yes, one CAN visit this place to pick up some soup. Equally well seasoned and light are their many soup offerings. Some popular ones are mixed hot and sour soup, chicken manchow soup and seafood coriander soup. The broths are well cooked and there is the right balance of flavours in their soups.

Order their seafood dishes like hot garlic prawn, chilli fish, and sweet and sour prawn - a good way to get an idea of the basic food served over here. For a first timer, the taste might not be to their liking but eventually you will get used to the flavours! They have an extensive veg and non veg fried rice and noodle staples and make fried rice dishes like chicken garlic fried rice, ginger garlic rice, lemon garlic fried rice just to name a few.

They also serve some north Indian and Bengali preparations but you have to gutsy enough to order them.

Ambiance is unimpressive for this very small food outlet and so is the service. The food is strictly average on the whole. The panfried momo's and the thuppa's are the best of the lot along with crispy lamb. The price is not too high and makes up for the average quality of the service.
On the whole an average eatery if you stay in a nearby locality.
