There was an offer on little app- 3 koraishutir kochuri and chicken kasha for just 100 bucks. Completely value for money. Tasted good, and the whole dish is very filling. A bit too oily,  which makes it hard to eat the whole thing. And I think they could have served the chicken with a bit more gravy. Will have to try other dishes here.

I was in office & was craving for some Bengali food...so thought of ordering from this place, which I regret till date.  I ordered karaisutir kachuri & mutton kasa....in one word both the items was pathetic in terms of taste & quality.. karaisutir kachuri was awful with no taste at all & mutton kasa was not even half cooked...overall not recommend if u r looking for good Bengali food...

Worst food quality.
Took Chingri malai curry, Mochar ghonto, Chicken dakbanglow. All are worst. Never expected that bad quality from Golabari, probably every one knows this name from Kolkata. Please atleast maintain your tradition and food quality.

The food here is downright opposite to what it claims to be. We had ordered over phone and the man who received was very rude and arrogant. 

We had mentioned that it'd be dinner for 3 and asked for suggestions accordingly. He suggested a plate of mutton dakbunglow , chicken curry and paratha. 

Not only the food was delivered to us after more than an hour but the quantity was meagre. There were 4 pieces of mutton and 2 pieces of chicken with an egg. I wonder how 3 people are supposed to have a proper dinner out of that! 

On top that both the gravies tasted more or less the same and tasted like regular curry. The mutton was well cooked but the chicken on the other hand was undercooked. In all, disappointed.

Food was excellent. I've really enjoyed the food. I would refer to all my friends and colleges.

"Mutton Duckbunglow" is specialty of them, but would ask them to take care of the mutton quality. Mutton was hard to chew. However, enjoyed the tasty food... :)

Located inside Bytes food court in Infinity benchmark this outlet is a hidden gem. It is the most popular counter of this food court and after trying their basanti pulao mutton kasha combo I just became a fan. Though it took them almost half an hour to deliver my food, the taste was just perfect and it compensated for the delay. Only regret, I will expect some better mutton pieces next time.

If you are wondering for some Great Bengali Cuisine Food must visit this place,specially at the Lunch time.

This Food Brand is basically a part of BYTES FOOD COURT, at Infinity benchmark.

The Basanti Pulao and Mutton DuckBunglow is the best Bengali Dish Combination I ever had from here.

For anyone craving for amazing Bengali Food- Mutton Golbari is the one-stop restaurant for all great Bengali food that you desire. The quantity is just enough and they deliver it to you well-before time. So if you are thinking of a Sunday- Brunch, how about a combo that I ordered as well? 
I ordered for Basanti Pulao with Chingri Malai Curry and topped it with Mango Chutney on a Sunday afternoon. It felt like straight out of a classic bengali novel describing a great sunday family lunch! 
The prawn was tender and well-cooked and the Mango Chutney had just the right texture and tanginess! The Basanti Pulao was one of the best I ever had. Heavily Aromatic and yummy. 
It was a delightful experience.

Really really nice bengali cuisine. I loved the service as well as the food. I had ordered mutton combo twice for home delivery. Every item was really yummy, specially the mutton kasha, it tastes really awesome and perfect. I then visited this place, ambiance was good, ordered chicken combo, rice, Mutton Duckbunglow, Aloo posto. Aloo posto and chicken combo was really nice. Though I didn't like the Duckbunglow item. But it's a really affordable place for bengali cuisine. Surely visit again and will order home delivery from here. You can visit this place and can have great bengali food.

Was rather flabergasted when i saw that this place has only a 3.4 rating. It is located conveniently in the Bytes Food Court ( Infinity Benchmark Building).
Very popular place (most happening in the food court for sure) for it's delicious food at jaw dropping prices.
Have tried almost all veg dishes here but have never gone over their Veg Thali ( pic attached). So much for just rs.100 is downright amazing and food is delicious with a special loud shoutout to the Dhokar Dalna.¬†
Go there once a week atleast and dont see that changing very soon.

Keep gobbling.

This is located inside Bytes food court beneath Infinity benchmark. The counter is situated in the corner of the premises.

We ordered the Maida mutton combo. The consisted of Two parathas, half portion of Mutton kasha, achar, salad and yoghurt. The parathas had very less oil and is a thumbs up. The mutton wasn't very fleshy and lacked the tenderness, the gravy though wasn't very@ oily and tasted very homely which is great. The yoghurt was good too. It costed us 125 and I feel it was value for money.

Will definitely visit again.

Its just beside my office, and I have visited this place many times, thus giving an accumulated review in general.
NEVER order dhokar dalna, prawn malaikari, potol alu from this place.
Dhokar dalna, too much of ghee.
Please prepare authentic malaikari if you are charging so much. It was just a good smelling onion gravy.
And alu potol is just water with spices.
The best items they provide is mutton dakbunglow, chicken nawabi, koraisutir kochuri, aloor Dum,aamer chatni and Basanti pulao.
But the service is slow with reasonable price. Thus if you have time then do visit, more or else your chosen items will decide your experience.

This outlet is located in the food court on the ground floor of Infinity Benchmark building opposite RDB cinemas. Easily the most popular and thus, the most crowded of all the outlets, it's made quite a name for itself by its quick and prompt service of good food. Mutton Kosha, Luchi and Dakbunglow are a must try here.

This place is credited with providing a deeply satisfying experience to my Foodie persona thoroughly. I really loved the food here. It was wonderfully prepared and packed just the right tastes.¬†

I had ordered a Mutton Duckbunglow, Dimer Dalna, Karaisutir Kochuri, and Plain Parathas. The great thing about the mutton dish was its texture. You see, a mutton dish prepared hastily renders the pieces very leathery and you, of course, wouldn't want to spend a lifetime chewing on a single piece, now would you? None of that here. The pieces were very well done. One added bonus in both the gravy dishes was the presence of copious spices making the gravy very rich. Loved every bite of it.¬†

The Kochuri was nicely done. A thing common to both the Kochuri and the Parathas was the size of them. Huge is the word. Eating two Parathas is enough to sustain a human for half a day.¬†

The price crunch is minimal. Deserves multiple visits.

Located at the bytes food court at sector 5, it is a purely bengali cuisine outlet which has named itself after the famous golbari at shyambazar...To be honest,we were not expecting much from this outlet but our dining ended with our expectations exceeded..It is one of the cheapest bengali cuisine outlets you would get in the entire city and the food tastes really good...We went for a little deal worth Rs 99 which included Pulao and chicken kosha....From the quantity perspective,the pulao was enough for 2..the chicken kosha had 2 pieces,which is okay but would have loved a little more gravy...Coming to the taste,the pulao tasted as good as the home made pulao and the chicken kosha was just so delicious...as good as i've ever had in a restaurant...service was also quick enough...I would definitely recommend this outlet for a bengali meal at an extremely affordable budget...

Lunch comprised of :

 By the time the paranthas arrived they were sticking to each other & had become leather tough .

2) koraishotir Kochuri : loved it ! It tasted just the way it should be , soft and stuffed good . Very yummy ! 

3) Mutton Duckbanglow :  with 4 mutton pieces and thick gravy mutton duckbanglow tasted heaven ! 

Looking forward to their other delicacies :)

My first order was hours late; they accepted the order, marked it as sent out, but then claimed they never got it and that it was a Zomato error. Ordering again a few days later to give this another shot (I *really* wanted a kosha mangsho option cheaper than 6BP in the neighborhood), but it looks like a repeat performance. Over an hour, no food, the restaurant won't answer their phone, and even though they've marked the order out for delivery, no one at Zomato support has any idea where they've gone or why they're not answering their phone.Heavy, intensely acidic oil, cold luchis, and scrawny mutton pieces from the first order would have hurt this review to begin with. At this point I'm hangry enough that the delivery guy should probably not bother showing up any more.

First of all there is no connection between this Golbari Mutton and Golbari outlet (Shyambazar). This outlet is a part of the Food Court of Infinity Building of Sector V Saltlake, so nothing to say regarding the ambiance and decoration. We had Rice, Chicken Dak Bungalow, Mutton Kasa with Lacha Paratha. Quality and quantity of the food was good and satisfying. Service was good too. Fee parking is available. Coming to price range then I will mark it as an AVERAGE.

Food was really nice but the quantity was a big question to me. If you guys are taking money you should give quantity according to that. I think you can work with time.

Give the rating only for their food... I tried the parathas  and chicken dakbunglo from here... taken office delivery via Swiggy... the taste was good... nothing to say about deco and ambience... the staffs are just clueless and that was the major reason behind such low rating... pocket pinch was considerably ok...

The name "Golbari" and instantly you think of mutton. This outlet is in sector 5 just opposite to BBQ Nation. 

Ordered in the Mutton Thali. They had Rice, Dal, Jhiri Jhiri Aloo bhaja (Bengali style crispy fried grated potatoes), Jhinge Aloo Posto, Mutton, Chutney and Papad. 

The rice came ice cold and I had to reheat it. The Jhinge aloo Posto was quite good, so was the aloo bhaja. However, a special mention to the Mutton gravy, it was just delicious. Perfect with rice. But unfortunately, the Mutton pieces were undercooked. You'd expect melt in the mouth, succulent meat that just falls of the bone but no. It needed more time to cook. Prices are decent. 

Craving for some bengali style mutton? Give this place a shot!

It is an obvious place for us to have lunch either on Thursday or Tuesday. Being a mutton lover I always order duckbunglow. But they should focus more on service. And sometimes mutton remains uncooked properly.

Last saturday my friend went to bring one of the favourite dish of mine, mutton duckbunglow from this place, the name of the place gives the memory of awsome mutton dish of the original golbari but unfortunately it was not. The mutton peices were slight hard, which should have been tender. The taste was surprisingly a bit sweet.. also the gravy was not so overrated, we had it in our lunch with polao...all together could not satisfy our tastebuds .. An average marking hence..

This is located in the Bytes Food Court, Infinity Benchmark Building.To all those have visited the food Court know how its ambiance is, for others it is a joint with 4-5 food counters serving their food. So you might need to be a little early to grab a seat as in peak hours it gets fully crowded.Coming to the food:We had ordered two different sets of Food:1) 4pcs Karaisutir Kachuri2) 1 plate mutton Dakbunglow3) 1 plate Mutton ThaliThe kachuri's were too good, crisp, not much oil, quite big in size as you can see from the image attached.4 kachuris and 1 plate dak bunglow is enough to satisfy an empty stomach.The Mutton thali was awesome, each item in it tasted good, the mutton preparation was similar to the mutton dakbunglow being served. I liked it to the core and the mutton was prepared so nicely it just melted in the mouth not chewy.I would love to visit again and try out other dishes.

Been ordering home delivery from mutton golbari for the last 3 days.needless to say ,found the food enjoyable,affordable n of good quality.hence the repeat orders. Had the mutton n chicken combos, alu posto n dimer dalna. My only concern is the use of oil n red chillies.a little less of both wouldn't hurt.delivery was prompt. Decent packaging too.good food n service

Ordered their Mutton Thali today for lunch via home delivery.The Thali will provide a sumptuous and satisfying meal for one individual.The packaging was nice and the quantity was sufficient.The Thali comprised of steamed rice,dal,seasonal veg,aloo bhaja,papad,mutton curry and chutney.The rice quality was good and the seasonal veg(In my case Alu posto) tasted great.However the mutton curry was bit of a let down.The mutton pieces were fibrous and could have been cooked a little more.The curry was spicy and tasted good.Overall the experience was average,however if you are looking for a good delivery option for lunch,this one is a nice choice.

I am a regular customer of "Mutton Golbari". The food quality was great until I visited there last week( 24th June 2016 ). The "Karaishutir Kachuri" decreased their size by half, not enough gravy in "mutton kasa", these two item was fabulous. Next time I visit to Bytes I will try another counter.

Its one of the best restaurant in Sector 5 where you will get great Bengali cuisine at an affordable price. Mutton Golbari is a part of the Bytes Food Court which in the ¬†Infinity Benchmark near to RDB. The best part about this place is they provide quality along with quantity and that too pocket friendly.¬†

Till date I have ordered various items from them, and they never disappointed me.

Items that I frequently order:

1. Bandhakopi Tarkari
2. Muger Dal
3. Mutton Jhol/ Kasa
4. Chicken Kasa/Jhol¬†
5. Pabda Jhal

6. Rice/Roti¬†

Food isn't just 'fuel' to keep us alive, it's one of life's basic pleasures, And it's always a pleasure for me to have food form Mutton Golbari.

Well, I surprised myself today by walking into this outlet which is reputed for its non-veg items ‚Äì me being a hardcore vegetarian. This outlet is a part of the Bytes Food Court near Infinity Building of Sector 5, Saltlake. They provide a common seating arrangement which is shared by customers of other outlets of the same food court ‚Äì viz ‚Äì The Shack, Coromandel Express, Old China etc! Ambience of the court is fine and some light music plays in the background. You cannot purchase food from any outlet without the Bytes Food Court food card.

I went for their veg thali which was served under 15 minutes and consisted steamed rice, dal fry, phoolgobhi, sukhto, aloo bhurji, aloo papad and sweet chutney. Quantity served was very decent and nice to see that 1 can eat his heart out with such a thali priced at just Rs. 100/-. Good to see that rice quality was fine. Also, phoolgobhi was a beauty ‚Äì contained some peas also ‚Äì as well as tasty. Dal fry was nice and had some tomato and jeera content as well. Aloo bhurji was again, fine ‚Äì same goes for the aloo papad. Since I personally don‚Äôt like Sukhto, I did not have the same ‚Äì although, it looked fine.
Pick of their items was the sweet chutney - and this is perhaps the 1st time I really enjoyed the chutney served at a Bengali outlet.
Their service deserves a special mentions (although this food court is completely self-serviced) ‚Äì the owner/ manager was very friendly and strived to address all customer preferences. 

Overall, a must try place!

It was a sunny afternoon yesterday when I went for a matinee film at RDBs, and as usual after the film, was hungry. I  was in a mood to have Bengali food, so took to Zomato to search for places nearby. This place was really pretty near. 
Location - located in the Bytes food court of the Infinity Benchmark building in Sector 5, Salt Lake very near to the RDB Boulevard.
Placing the order - You have to get a card of the food court in exchange for cash and then you can place order with the card. 
Food ordered - I had ordered one plate of Mutton Kasha, two Parathas and one plate of normal Curd.
Food - The mutton kasha tasted really well, spicy, rich in the masala, with a perfect Bengali cuisine flavour. But yes, it cant beat the Mutton Kasha from the original Golbari of Shyambazar.
The Parathas were good. Well made, tasted good.
The curd was okay. It lacked the creamy texture and the solidification. 
Overall, it was a good experience trying the Bengali food out here. The perk is the price, which is really pocket-friendly.

Being a copycat, does not really guarentee you success! Located opposite Barbeque Nation, inside the foodcourt, had paid a visit here once once. Ordered for a Luchi Cholar Daal combo and Koraishutir Kochuri and Mutton Kosha. The Cholar Daal was sweet and mushy, just like any Bengali would love it. The Koraishutir Kochuri was big in size and had sufficient stuffings. The Mutton tasted good as well. The gravy was thick and 'Kosha', but lacked the touch or aura of the original Golbarir Mangsho (Not so good copying afterall). The pricing wasn't cheap, but wasn't high as well. The service was pretty fast, and I was served my parcel without much delay. Maybe I will come back here again when I get the time, but the food quality needs some improvement.

We tried their mutton kasa which is apparently their USP. However, apart from the gravy, the mutton pieces were a thorough disappointment. Their luchi (indian bread) might be big in size but wasn't soft. The service was a bit slow too. The only good thing was the price. However, the price is in tune with the quality.

This is 'the'' place to visit for Bong Mutton dishes if you are in Sec 5/Salt Lake. I just cant have enough of it. Very good portions, with mutton cooked perfectly in authentic Bong style and at the right pricing. Must try: Mutton Duckbunglow and Mutton Kasha.

Well, to begin with, I have never paid a visit to this restaurant actually but ordered for a delivery. So my review is strictly based on the food quality and price.
To begin with, we were searching for some inexpensive bengali eatery, and this is what zomato suggested us. After going through some of the reviews, we came to know that Mutton Kasa is the USP of this restaurant. Hence we placed our order which included Steamed Rice, Roti, Luchi, Mutton Kasa and Chicken Dakbunglow.
The quantity of the items is at par with their reasonable prices. A full plate of Steamed Rice would suffice an individual for a proper meal. The Mutton Kasa had 3/4 pieces of mutton and a thick gravy, which isnt very oily, unlike other restaurants. But, to my disappointment, the mutton pieces werent tender ones and had lot of bones in them. That left me unsatisfied.
For the Chicken Dakbunglow, there were four small pieces of Chicken accompanied with an egg. The taste of this dish seemed quite similar to a regular chicken curry. There was nothing fancy about the taste of this dish, apart from the fact that the chicken pieces were tender and juicy.
Overall, I am not very complacent with the quality of the food here, but would like to try this place one more time for some other items, before recommending this restaurant to others. But surely this place serves Bengali food at noticeably low prices, so you wouldnt burn a hole in your pocket, when you order from here.

Unlike most Bengalis, I am not fond of kosha mangsho or mutton in any form. But I think I have already changed my mind after visiting Mutton Golbari last month. I was introduced to this place by my father and its the best thing that has happened during my trip back home.¬†

The mutton was extremely tender and juicy, with the right mix of spices that awakened my taste buds like never before. Some 'fulko' luchi complemented the dish and compelled me to promise myself that this is a must visit place during all my Calcutta trips henceforth.

To all people there, strongly recommend that you visit this place at the earliest to get the most reasonable and authentic kosha mangsho ever!

Mutton Golbari is one of the newest additions to the long list of eateries present here at the techie alleys of Kolkata. And yes, this place has no link with the legendary Golbari at Shyambazar. Based on my past two dining experiences at this joint, I would say they have got pretty nice food to offer and is definitely the best outlet from where you can have your lunch at the Bytes food court.

LOCATION - - - - - Located inside the Bytes food court which is there at the ground floor of Infinity Benchmark building (opposite RDB Boulevard near SDF crossing, Saltlake Sector-5).

AMBIANCE - - - - - The place is just a kiosk or an outlet at the Bytes Food Court. You can collect your food from the counter with pre-paid cash card and enjoy your meal at the food court which is well lit and clean. The furnitures are tidy and moderate in terms of looks or design. The place remains crowded at lunch hours, so in the worst case you may need to wait for sometime to grab a seat.

FOOD - - - - We tried the below food items from this joint:

(a) Mutton Kosha ‚Äì The plate has got 4 pieces of mutton pieces at INR 160 inclusive of taxes. Very reasonable indeed and the dish can be shared by two persons. The mutton pieces were tender and the gravy was thick and tasty and I didn‚Äôt find any extra oil oozing out. But I would say the taste quotient did not reach its epitome because the stuff could have been cooked a bit longer on high flames, which would have made the dish more true to its name. The dish which was served was actually a dried up & very thickened mutton curry. Also I didn‚Äôt like the fact that it had some crushed pieces of bones in the curry which was annoying while you are devouring the food. Also I would have loved some complementary onion and chilli salad along with this dish which was not provided. But considering the taste and price, I would recommend this dish.

(b) Koraishutir Kochuri ‚Äì It is a Bengali dish where fresh green peas paste is stuffed inside Indian bread and then deep fried. Here at Mutton Golbari this was one gem of an item. I was probably tasting the best Koraishutir Kochuri of my life! It was so soft, fluffy, tender and filled in with correct amount of green peas filling inside. Felt heavenly when I was having it with the Mutton Kosha. Must Try!

(c) Roti ‚Äì Regular handmade Indian Roti, nothing fancy. I would recommend to improve the size and make it softer to stay ahead in this competitive market.

(d) Mutton Thali ‚Äì The dish has got great value for money quotient. The thali gives you a satisfying and complete meal. It has got steamed rice, dal, vegetable curry, mutton curry, aloo bhaja (fry), chutney and papad. All the items tasted good and were above average. You can surely go for it for a regular meaty Bengali lunch :)¬†

(e) Egg Thali ‚Äì Very good for regular lunch having steamed rice, dal, vegetable curry, egg curry, aloo bhaja, chutney and papad. The egg curry has got 2 pieces of boiled eggs. Overall all the items tasted good and the price is extremely reasonable.

SERVICE - - - - - It takes them a while to deliver your food because they receive loads of orders which they deliver sequentially. Otherwise the person at the counter is prompt and extremely polite.

OVERALL - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.7/5
Food quality: 3.8/5
Food presentation: 3.2/5
Value for money: 4/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Service: 3.4/5

Thumbs up from my end! Do try their Mutton Kosha and Koraishutir Kochuri to feel the ultimate bliss at amazing pocket pleasing rates.

Cheers!

I went there sometime back with a friend. Its in the bytes food court so the ambience is decent. We had ordered Mochar Chop, Sonamukhi Chingri,Luchi Cholar Dal and Chicken Kasa. The aim was to try Bengali cuisine. The person at the counter was helpful and helped me pick out items. He suggested mutton but since I don't have it, I stuck to chicken. The Mochar Chop was good, the Sonamukhi Chingri was extremely basic I would not recommend, The cholar dal was too bland but the Chicken was good. I don't know about the other items on the menu but the person at the counter definitely didn't help me pick out good items!

This is a part of Bytes food court @ Infinity Benchmark building. The only thing about them is their food. I choose Mutton Kasa and Parata... just awesome. Mutton with a rich gravy and the super smooth parata makes me happy in my lunch.

My suggestion is you should try one day if you have the office near to this place.

Before getting into the details I would like to mention that this is the third occasion in last 2 weeks that I visited this place at lunch. Reasons being just a stone throwing distance from my work and the food..which is just delicious üòä and i'm rating a 4 for only its food quality and taste.
Location - is Bites food court at ground floor of Infinity Benchmark
Name - as the name suggests they seriously serve awesome mutton kosha.. In all the three occasions I ordered it and every time it fulfilled my heart.
Today we had ordered for Poster bora with kashundi, then koraisutir kochuri and mutton kosha.
Hot poster bora is lip-smacking. Price - 45/- a plate which contains 2 pieces of size of an 'alur chop'!
Koraisutir kochuri is just too good with correct amount of peas paste inside, not much oily, just perfect. Price 15/- per piece. 3 is more than enough for one.
Then mutton kosha - which costs 160/- per plate containing 4 pcs of soft mutton with perfect blend of spices.
A very nice food joint and definitely recommended for a lunch. 
Pocket pinch for us was - around 240/- per head, as we had poster bora, 3 kochuri and 1 full plate of mutton kosha.
