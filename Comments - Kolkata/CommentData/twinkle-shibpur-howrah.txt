We used to visit this place during our school days. It is located at howrah maidan area. Though food is not great but very pocket-friendly. Ideal place for students.

A place which was at a stone throw distance from my school and it was very frequented by students of our school..famous among school mates for their chowmein.. Taste is okayish but quality is really bad.. One must try to avoid if they are not hungry like a shark like we used to be when we were in school.. Lol ðŸ˜‚

TRY TO AVOID. Food quality is not very good. The place is also not so nice, you will easily find other better options near to the same place.

Descent place. If you are on a low budget this is the place you are looking for. Though dont expect anything much. Not a hygienic place i must say....
