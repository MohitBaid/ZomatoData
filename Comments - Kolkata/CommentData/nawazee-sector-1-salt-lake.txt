We had ordered Chinese and we loved it. The fish was extremely soft and flavourful and the fried rice was spicy, just the way I like it. The staff was very polite with us and I would not regret my decision of visiting this place.

A quiet place, with calm interiors and courteous staff, this place is quite good! 
Loved the tengri kebab and enjoyed the biryani too. Also, pretty pocket friendly. Has a snacks counter outside the restaurant which serves rolls. The rolls are delicious! Do try this restaurant once!

We had once. ordered 6 masala kulchas for home dilevery. They had delivered 3 masala kulchas each bisected on the middle to make them look six. A fraudish place..... The staff lack the basic training, and while serving, they drop food on the table, and do not replenish it. The Biryani had cooked and half-cooked rice. A nightmare of a foodie's destination is Nawazee !!!!!

This was my worst experience with any restaurant ever. I wish i could give 0.1 stars.

I went there with my sisters on Bhai Dooj. We ordered a lot of things.
We first ordered ¬†Biriyani , ¬†Reshmi kebab. We even ordered a nasi goreng fried rice.
After eating the kebab we waited almost for an hour for the main course to come. Suddenly the waiter came with everything we ordered then told us that they had ran out of potatoes for the biriyani so they put boiled egg in it. We refused to eat it and told him that we can wait you can prepare the potatoes. This conversation was held at 4:00 PM and they gave the biriyani (which was extremely sweet for some reason) with a potato was just unflavoured boiled potato There was also a dirty fly disturbing us continuously. Such poor service!!. Almost every food tasted weird and horrible. The rice in the fried rice was so hard that we could not even chew it. I never even write reviews but I had to do it for this one üò°¬†

BEWARE! Don't plan your meal here.

Have been here a few times and my experience every time has been mixed. The first time I had gone during lunch service, they said that they don't serve biriyani for lunch despite of it being in the menu. Their rolls are decent enough, though with a bit too much mustard ketchup and the chicken tastes funny at times. Recently, I went on soptomi with a friend and we had chelo kabab, naan and a chicken dish. The naan and chicken were awesome. But the chelo kabab was a huge let down. All the kababs were tough and chewy. The staff was a let down too. Our waiter didn't know the constituents of the chicken dish, had to ask the head waiter.

wanted to dine there but place was horrible, their behavior was absolutely unacceptable, Nawazee is extremely unprofessional, I had called them around 9:50pm today to redeem my bought deal(little App)but they simply denied to do so bcoz as per them deal was valid till 9:30pm whereas it is clearly written that till 10:30pm.They told me that that is wrongly mentioned in the voucher. how a customer will b able to know? Also where is our fault??really unacceptable, This kind of merchant is spoiling little App reputation, I hv never ever faced this before with nearbuy.please look into this,I can also send u the voice recording of their communication, I had called them in evening but that time they didn't say anything about timing. they could have told me that time,I would have arranged something else.this was embarrassing for me n my family.

For a neighbourhood place, I hate to rate it so low, but the fact remains that their food has been below par. The rolls we ordered were not up to the mark, the biryani outright dry and tasteless, the mutton pieces in it poorly cooked. The only benefit was a quick delivery since it is just around the corner, but I don't think I'll order from them again.

The second best thing to eating is obviously talking about it and wen it's my bday good food is what makes d day better üòã

So my birthday was celebrated there..the interior decoration was attractive and ambience was very decent.the staffs were nice to us.

Coming to the food,the cheese kabab was ok..not as expected...dal makkhani was very tasty.. paneer polao,butter chicken, mutton kasa was tasty no doubt and served nicely..but thn they played with our emotion (jokes apart) Biriyani is an emotion for every Kolkatabasi but here Biriyani was worst it was not cooked properly the potato was not well cooked as well as the chicken also..evn the chicken was very dry..thn sahi tukda came and saved there ass..it was soft and creamy and ghee flavoured.it was my favourite.

Overall nawazee is good budget restaurant..but they should make better Biriyani..max. people complained about this...

4.0/5 from my side

Interior is well designed and a good ambience i would say.. The orders are served a little late. The service is not upto the mark. There should more service men to provide quality service to the customers.
The Indian dishes are really good but Biryani and the kebab section taste and quality should be improved more..

Though we had a prior appointment, they refused to serve us at first. After 10-15 minutes of discussion they finally accepted our little coupon.

After all these messes they came with all the dishes together, and the most shocking factor is they do not even have a proper menu card, as they gave us a photocopy of it.

Food looks like so great, but frankly speaking the taste is not upto the mark. Biriyani was very spicy, potatoes were not boiled properly. Chicken gravy items were just ok type. Cheese Kabab was the only item which was great. Even lime soda was so much salty.

And last but not the least, the waiters were very unprofessional. We had to go to the counter by ourselves to pay the bill.

Very bad experience however.....would not suggest anyone to visit there.

The worst restaurant I have ever seen.. It's situated at AD block. First impression was quite good. But when comes to food all our expectations went down. They don't even to know how to treat a customer. we ordered -
1) cheese kebab nd malai kebeb... ( ok )
2) chicken biriyani ( just like non sense ...they gave us handi biriyani instead of normal biriyani, we did not like the taste..the potato was not boiled properly)
3) chicken tikka masala(good) , chicken butter masala( avg),. chicken chap ( ok) ....but the chicken was not soft.
4) And last the lemon soda...worst thing they gave us... salty no suger added indise.. 

They just ruined our friend's birthday party also our mood... thats it... I will never recommend this dine to anyone.

Nawazee is a place licated in the quiet streets of Salt Lake.The interior is spacious and the walls and decorations look royal.The soft yellow lighting matching with the decor of the walls makes the ambience of the place very pleasing.Coming to the food,which is quiet poor.The biryani is undercooked and the rice is hard and the mutton distasteful.The desert is average.The dal makhani is the only thing I liked.The service is good.

The interiors are very calm and cozy. Staff is rather polite albeit very slow. Seating at Nawazee is good too. Proper straight wooden chairs, perfect for a dining table. I avoid the sofa as it has a slant inwards.

Food is quite nice. Had the rating been only for the food, Nawazee deserves a clear 4. But the overall experience leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the kababs are very soft and succulent. But it's tough to distinguish the Kandahari kabab from Reshmi. Do try the Amritsari Tangri kabab. In the main course, most gravies have a sweet note, but methi chicken is really nice and creamy. My personal favourite at Nawazee is not the dine in experience but the egg chicken roll that's sold at their counter. It's filled with chicken made to perfection for just ‚Çπ50.

Nawazee-The name itself suggests the genre of food and the line-up of recipes one must indulge into.

But does it live up to the expectations?

Let's first talk about the ambience.

The place is spacious,spacious enough to let that air from the kitchen swirl to each and every corner of the food joint carrying the magical aroma of awadhi delicacies.
The whole place is lit by premium yellow bulbs and that surely adds to the photogenic set up.
The walls are offered a nice artistic feature.

Ambience : 4.2/5

*Service*

This place ain't that popular despite it's relatively cheap prices of food and it's enticing combo meal options thus the service ain't that polished due to lack of "practice" :P

Still,i have seen reviews where many of 'em have deducted point's for their service but let me assure you,it ain't that bad.
They even helped us out by clicking an amazing group picture with my buddies.

Ambience : 4.2/5

*Food*

Now let's come to the pivotal point of this review,the food?
Biriyani was a disaster, especially the potatoes.They were literally undercooked and the spark was missing from the chicken.
Kebabs were the saviour,but,to a certain extent.
The butter chicken tasted too "buttery" as it was over flavoured and tasted dull.

The showstopper though was the DAAL MAKHNI.
I loved the way it danced it's way to the tandoori roti and melted delicately into it.
Perfectly cooked,balanced application of spices,ahh.

Keeping the negatives aside,i'll prefer the foodies out there to give it a try,you won't be disappointed,considering the price range.

First of all the zomato tag says that seating is not available which is not the case. They have a decent air-conditioned and well maintained seating arrangement.
There wasn't a single thing which i could suggest restaurant management for improvement. Staff were extremely courteous and food was amazingly tasty and as it should be.
Amongst all that i had, i am in love with their shahi tukda. The preparation was bang-on. The crispiness of bread was maintained while adequately drenched with sugar syrup and rabri tossed with little amount of cherry.
I had ordered for reshmi butter masala, dal makhani, kulcha and paneer pulav for the main course. Must tell you that dal makhani had the authentic creamy punjabi flavour.
For the starters, the chicken tikka was tender and juicy.
Overall i had a great time and i had actually overeaten after a really long time.

I have been eyeing this restaurant for quite some time... Mainly because of a particular item in their menu - The Cheli Kebab. Wanted to try out their version of Chelo... But was disappointed !!
The plating was nice.. but the taste was not good at all.
If a Peter Cat Chelo would get 10/10, Nawazee Chelo would fetch a max 3.5/10.
The portion size was much less. Mutton seekh kebab was too hard and chewy. Butter Rice didn't have any herbs. Chinken chunks were quite small.

The interiors of the restaurant is nice and that gives a cosy feel, though.

One of the most unprofessional restaurant I ever visited . owner seems to be too much reluctant about his business and don't know how to treat customers . I was with my family and friends.All of us were extremely dissatisfied .If their behaviour is the main reason ,then the second reason must be food quality and taste.Even they don't know how to make firni. It was only boiled rice with milk.Salad was also stale . please try to find any roadside dhaba for your enjoyment if you don't want to spoil your time.

Went to this place yesterday for a dinner.Had decent ambience and decoration. We had purchased a coupon from Little app.The food was good both quantity and quality wise except the dessert which had no  taste at all. The only cons was the waiter who insisted us to sit on a small table for two despite the restaurant being completely empty.Also he kept bringing the main course and dessert even when we hadn't finished the starter. Quite a turn off.Otherwise it was a nice experience.

Worst restaurant in salt lake, even the behaviour of front desk is like hooligans.
Better stay away from it.
Food is rotten and stale, they take container charges of rs 20 per container which is use and throw plastic container. Ridiculous.
They even challenge customers.
Business ethics are not known to them.
Please do not waste your money in stale and rotten food.
Even roadside eateries are much better than nawazee.

Mutton quality's not great, so the chicken's a better bet here. Extremely lackadaisical staff; no one cares if you need water, they'll forget half the dishes you ordered, some items will just never come out, and you'll end up asking three other waiters for that same glass of water, even if you're the only people there. They're too busy hanging out and watching TV, and they're pretty used to the place always being empty.

Tried them a few times since they're right down the street, but gave up; it's better to pay the premium and just do Aminia instead.

Firstly i would like to mention the restaurant is having awesome ambience and best for those who want to enjoy a quite lunch/dinner with family and friends...
The menu offers a wide range of mouth watering kebabs..the kandhari kebab and ¬†chelo kebab platter are lip-smacking...nawazee is also having a roll counter which sells really tasty rolls...the taste of biriyani is also very unique and definitely different from other conventional biriyani..the menu is well priced and pocket friendly..
The staffs polite nature can often be mistaken as their cold approach towards the client.
Overall experience : a great place to enjoy meals and always a first choice to visit during any festival or occasion.

The decor is done in nawabi theme , the only aspect i liked about this restaurant , white seats and couches with well spaced tables , brightly lit interiors succeeded to set the first impression nicely.

But The wall pictures of places like grand canyon etc were total mismatch with the theme, the loud Bollywood channel that the staff were busy watching completely spoiled the ambience. Some soft instrumental or ghazals in the background would have done wonders.
Got one pamphlet instead of a menu card (no clue why they lack a proper menu card) , prices seemeed very reasonable .
Too Many of the items were not available.
We ordered for a CHICKEN CHEESE KEBAB, DAL MAAKHANI , BUTTER NAAN, MUTTON KASSA(nothing else in mutton was available) , PANEER SHAHI PULAO , CARAMEL CUSTARD ( due to unavailability of our choice of shahi tukra)

Dal and naan were the only things upto the mark , liked the 'balti' concept of serving dal , pulao had cubes of paneer in normal rice nothing close to the word 'shahi' , kebabs were okayish , mutton was rock solid which we resent for futher cooking but whatever came was not likeable. Caramel custard was dissapointing as well. The cooking and the presentation needs to be improved but the most important thing is the quality of meat that is used makes the dish made it below standard.
This place lacks a good chef which was evident.

The service is also cold ,the staff really need to be smart and interactive , it seemed no body was even interested if we liked the meal or not.

While the glasses , knife amd fork look royal made of  brass ,  the plates are plain white . Abruptness!

I would have given maximum a 2.5 out of 5 , but since its a new outlet and has a huge scope and full potential to do much better , i would consider to add .5 , my suggestion would be to appoint a better chef who excels in Indian cuisine.Honestly The food seemed to be like from a roadside shop.

I am very surprised  to see such bad reviews of this place.  I live down the road and have ordered a home deliver and the food has always been quite good.  

The first day,  I ordered a chicken tikka and a chicken Chatpata  with paneer rice,  all were decent.  

Second day I stuck to kebabs as the chicken tikka last time was quite good.  So I ordered a fish tikka,  which was really well made.  The kebab platter was also quote delicious .  It comprised of amritsari tangri,  malai kebab and Kasturi kebab.  

The Kasturi  was actually quite good as was the amritsari tangri.  The malai kebab is tasty buy very very rich.  

Overall I prefer the kebabs over the mains.  

Good effort with the food.  

Cheers!

Now coming to the food part ... I had ordered chicken biryani.. hariyali kabab....chicken labaabdar..butter nan ..and chicken butter masala.............
I think they don't know what is a chicken biryani... only adding color n perfumes is not a biryani you must make a combination of good spices too.. come to kabab it's not so tender ..when I chew I can feel the taste of raw chicken .. rubbish yougurt taste it was not at all properly cooked seriously,, are yaar!! lagta hai they forget to tandoor it well... ahhh .... butter man is ok... but again chicken labaabdar and chicken butter masala is not up to the mark bcoz of flat taste which almost looks same.....
