My father likes their food items. I have also tried the dosa, dahi vada and upma. I liked the food, but it could have been better. I think the prices are on the higher side. The service is quick and behaviour of the staffs is good.

As a South Indian outlet located at Avani mall it is not value for money.
But the food taste good.
Tried Cheese Onion Garlic Masala Dosa and was good in taste Coconut chutney and Sambhar taste average but the masala inside the dosa had good taste.

This counter serves south Indian food... So we tried Butter dosa, paper dosa, idli, dahi vada, cold coffee food was average... Price was a little high as I have eaten more tasty dosa, vada and idly at a less price than this... Over all it was nice and serves light veg items...

Very poor quality of South Indian food. Try only if are dying of hunger and there is nothing else in the food court. Overall, needs loads of improvement in terms of quality!

I am a great fan of Mysore Masala Dosa mainly because I  have spent 2 years in the Godly place after which this dish is named. I have tasted it in every south Indian restaurent I had ever been too and this place was no different. But little disappointment awaited me. It tasted below average and I am saying so even after considering the fact that I am in Kolkata and not in any southern state.

I followed that order with aloo vada which was little undercooked. The service was fast. The person at the counter looked frustrated and angry at something.

My ratings

Food:2/5 -  considering uncooked alooo vada
Service:3/5
Hygiene: 3/5
Value for money:3/5
Recommend: Sorry but difficult for me to recommend this as I am a big fan of south Indian food and this place disappointed a bit.
