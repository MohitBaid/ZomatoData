I love this bakery! We ordered a dozen cupcakes based solely on proximity to my in-law's house in Kolkata, It was a little strange ordering over the phone from Delhi as a newbie, but Rajeeta the owner took my order, And that didn‚Äôt deter me from getting great customer service. Rajeeta delivered the cakes personally, so nice of her. My¬† In laws only got to try the cupcake out of the box‚Ä¶. and to the gods of taste, it was perfectly balanced. The texture was light as well as the flavor. Not too sweet, but the impact of flavor was still there. The cupcakes are moist, delicious, and have just enough sweetness. Also, their cupcakes are filled inside with frosting! The frosting and cream filling was perfectly light and well balanced with the amount of cupcake. The experience of eating a perfectly made cupcake is stunning. The presentation was spot on. The cupcakes looked perfect and tasted better than the looks.
Once I saw pictures my cupcake order, I knew I had to leave a glowing review. I received great feedback from my parents in law, Needless to say, I‚Äôll be back for the very next event. May God bless the joint!!

The chef was very helpful and understood by need in detail.

And Hola.. a beautiful and tasty cake baked freshly was given to me.

My mom really liked the design and taste was awesome.

Thank you Team Chocolate and Fusion :)

I ordered a 'chocolate fudge' cake for my parents anniversary from this place. The look of the cake completely made us all fall in love with it. Not just that, it was also delectable! Will give a thumbs up to this fusion of chocolate with vanilla coating. Would recommend it to everyone.

The reviews on this page made me wanna try it out. Had lots of hope frm this place. Ordered a oreo crush cake for my sister's bday. The cake was very nicely decorated but it tasted horrible. The chocolate ganache covering the cake was very very salty while the cream frosting used inside was unevenly mixed and had lumps of sugar here and there. The cake itself had become soggy and was smelling. No one could eat the cake. they should atleast taste a bit of their creams and frosting before selling them to make sure everything is alright!

Got this blueberry choclate cake for my girlfriend's Birthday . I guess the tastiest cake i ever had . The name of your company says it all. Loved the concepts and about the pricing , noone can provide at this rate . Just a sujjestion for you work on the bread itss good but it needs to be a bit more to the soft side otherwise your cakes deserve 10 out of 10
