When you feel warmly welcomed, the impression lasts. That is precisely what The Time Machine is all about. It is a hookah parlour, alright but you can hang out with your buddies even if you are not a Hookah fan. The chicken club sandwiches are yummy and so are the grilled ones. Although the music tends to be overbearing at times, the staff is always at your service to turn it down or switch it off entirely. I didn't have the hookah but my friends told me that it was good. The staff is very friendly and co-operative.
They are doing good as a startup and I hope they make a mark soon! ðŸ˜Š

Run essentially by a bunch of kids who have a very narrow vision of a colourful lifestyle but needs a lot of coaching on running a hookah joint or a cafe. Not all customers enjoy very loud music or a constant beeline of the crowd constantly passing by. In short plz visit if you are dying to get a bad headache. One good point the kids running the joint a very well behaved. Guys if you are reading this plz improve on privacy, choice of beverages and the volume control of your music system.
