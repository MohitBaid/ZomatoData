Belgian Waffle Junction is the new heaven for all the waffle lovers. This is the first waffle joint in Kolkata which has got bubble waffles. Oh and they have a variety of lolly waffles too. Amazing place, I'm so glad it's just 5 mins away from where I stay ‚ù§

visited on the opening weekend
Was surprised to see the crazy rush, but after recieveing my order, found the rush to be truly justified.
The chocolicious bubble waffle is a paradise for chocolate lovers.
they have some very refreshing flavours like coco red velvet nutella.
you're missing out on a lot, if you havent visited this joint yet

Visited on the second day. The ambience wasn't good at all. They were quick with the service. Tried their Nutella waffle lolly which was tasting just of the whipped cream. The waffle was thin but they had spread Nutella generously. They can do much better. Tried their chocolate ice cream waffich with chocolate waffle which was nice and refreshing. 

Their 2 in one waffle which has a chocolate base and the filling is of white chocolate. The white chocolate is generously spread.

If you want those bubbly waffles then this is the place to be.
First of its kind found in our city.
You will not be disappointed.

Location : opposite footpath of the Audi showroom in New Alipore. You won't have any trouble spotting it.

Interior : Graphic wall and post it note wall for writing your feedbacks are there for you. But the only negative part is that they have a space crunch. Seats are less and it might just get too crowdy for you. 


Food:The only thing I could taste was the chocolicious bubbly waffle. It was massive. Even for a foodie like me , I could not just finish it up in one go . It was sinfully delicious.
They also have different types of shakes as well as waffles.
I will be re visiting this place soon.
Its the place to be if you want some bubblicious waffles.

I have tried other waffle places but this one is surely the best. Their speciality are the bubble waffles. We  had blueberry cheese flavour which was okayish (expected better), chocolate waff wich which was really yummy. But the star was chocolasious which was a bubble waffle. They have ample of options. Hope to visit again soon

Located opposite to the Audi showroom,New  Alipore,this island of waffle stands out to be a heartthrob.I and my sister was lucky to be one of the 1st 50 customers to have a dig at the waffle junction.We ordered redvelvet waffle and choco waff-wich.The Belgian waffle melts in your mouth and teases ur taste buds to have more n more.Price is worth the quantity n quality. Dessert lovers make your new year worth count,visit Belgian Waffle Junction.
