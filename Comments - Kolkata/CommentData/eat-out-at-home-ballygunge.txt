Takeout restaurant offering so many cuisine is a rarity in the city. Yet this is one of that kind.
Food was good and nicely packed.
Ya it was not so good as it would have been when served instantly. Still it was good.

Perhaps the only takeaway place in Kolkata offering the most exotic cuisines ever. They serve everything right from Indian to Mediterranean, Pan Asian...anything under the sun. The best part, each and every cuisine taste perfectly authentic. If you want quality food with good variety, this is it. They also provide serving trays and dishes in case you are looking for hassle free catering service.
Personal favourites: Ravioli, Sushi and the Butterscotch Sandesh
