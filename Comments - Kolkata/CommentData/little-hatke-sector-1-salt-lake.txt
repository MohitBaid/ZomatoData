Nice veggie delites. Sandwiches are good and reasonably priced. But the gravy wasn't upto the mark. Pizza was slightly harder than normal.

Good food joint.

Ordered two veg grilled sandwiches with add-on cheese. Delivery was on time, the food was tasty and the delivery guy was extremely polite. Pretty much what is expected, right? I'll go with a 5 star.

Sad, they declined my online order. Seems manpower is the issue. Hope to taste a little hatke soon. The pricing is very competitive and the menu, attractive.
