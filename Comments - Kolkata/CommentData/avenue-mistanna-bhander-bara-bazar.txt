Avenue Mistanna Bhandar is on the CR Avenue just opposite of Medical College. Went to try few sweets here. Tried the Joy Nagar's Moa which was much much poor in Quality.
Next I tried the Kaju Barfi. Again I was upset with their quality. Very poor.
Sweets range from Rs.6 - Rs.10

Went here today the shop was in renewal. So no sweets and snacks for me. They're serving only idli and masala dosa but their taste was not so good and they're also not smelling fresh. Only one staff there who was behaving rudely.
