I have been this place with my friends and found out a great combo with only 200 bugs compare to others, so we orderd all 3 combos and found that the daal makhani was a total wastage beside non veg items like chooza kabab and tikka kabab and the white gravy wasnot at all tastes good, though a combo such with 2 naans it a pocket friendly item overall.

No specialisation or professionalism in most of the dishes. Tried Gosht Biryani and Afghani Kabab. Food was decent. Nothing to boast or compliment about. Okay place to go after a day at the Acropolis mall. Quantity and quality score a 6 out of 10. Don't expect much. They provide raita with their biryani.

This place didn't please me much as their dishes lacked taste..all of the items had a very pale taste and quantity was super less..so it would have been much better if they concentrated on making the dishes better and not on the profit.

I ordered (through Swiggy) a combo meal of Dal Makhani + Chicken Chooza Kebab Masala (3 Pcs) + Tandoori Roti (2Pcs). Both the dishes were delicious. The rotis were also fresh and soft. A slice of lemon and chopped onions came with the pack. Overall a perfect and delicious combo. If you are having lunch or dinner the 2 rotis/naans may not be enough. The downside is that the combo is a bit pricey.

Ordered awadhi chicken biriyani for lunch.. The biriyani was accompanied with ring onions and raita.. The biriyani was light and the chicken pieces were boneless.. what I felt was the chicken pieces lacked salt and felt more of a like boiled... The biriyani was quite good and different frm the kolkata style of biriyani we usual have in kolkata... The raita was also good.. overall a decent one..

Okayish prawn biriyani served with raita and onion salad. The biriyani was saltless. However the prawn pieces were of medium size and tasty. 
Costing 250 bucks, I find it a bit pricey..but okayish.

This place is situated inside the Acropolis Mall.
Since this is inside a mall's food court so nothing to talk about ambience and staff. 
We ordered Awadhi chicken biriyani. 
The taste was not bad. 
It was differnt from the typical biriyanis we usually get in kolkata, this was light, there were 3 small pieces of chicken. It was served with a bowl of raita and onion rings.
The taste was ok.
Compared to rhe price the quantity was not upto the mark. 
Overall good experience.

This review is based solely on one item on their menu which we have tasted and which we order everytime we visit. Murgh Afghani tikka- So tender, so moist, so perfectly cooked and such a nice flavour and taste that I rank this kebab higher than those available at many popular mughlai joints in the city. We have not tasted other items on their menu but will surely try.

Had d worst Biryani of my life.. Trust me... a big nooo.. a salt less, zeroooo on taste loaded with golap-jol/keora-jol, or god knws wat.. it was pathetic...and dat cost u more than 200rps.. 190 fr chkn and 220 for mutton if im.nt wrong..

D initial look was appealing.. so we ordered.. i wanted Chinese. However som of my frnds preferd this.. so we thught lets try..

 im very against of throwing away food.. bt today i was left with nooo options.. we ordered 1 chkn, 1 mutton Biryani.. 2 points given coz mutton was chewable. 

Any roadside 30/40/50 rps will taste 1000 times bwtter than this pathetic food called Biryani served with TulsiPata.. 
A BIG NOOOO

It is at the food court of Acropolis mall and serve quality food. I had their daal makhani, chicken Reshmi butter masala and naan combo. The chicken pieces were decent in size and soft. Their makhani was good and the naan was fine. But the taste of the food cannot be applauded. The Reshmi chicken was little sweet and blant. 
Their service is quick but I was disappointed with the taste.

As the name says it all, it serves mughlai food exclusively. We ordered a combo meal consisting of naans, chicken reshmi kabab, dalmakhani, pickels and salad and a plate of awadhi chicken biriyani which came with raita, 4 pieces of chicken, an egg and a potato. The dalmakhani in the combo tasted really good, better than the chicken reshmi kabab. The biriyani also tasted really nice and light but i would have preferred if the essence used was a bit less.
All over it was a good experience.

An exclusively North Indian/Mughlai food outlet by 6 Ballygunge Place, located in the food court of acropolis Mall. You will be really disappointed if you go in for their Biryani-the taste is below average. The kebabs and other chicken dishes are a little better off. But if you want some North Indian food inside the mall, without wasting your money, just try their thalis or combo meals and starters. Price here is okay. Ambience is good. But I won't eat again!

Visited Acropolis Mall on 28th June,2017, with my friend & we were in hurry , saw This Outlet MUGHAL SARAI , Frankly I never heard of this before.
But I choose the COMBO MEAL : Dal Makhni, Reshmi Murg Dhaniwal Korma (3pc), Naan (2Pc), which was only rs 200.
We got our Food within 15 mins, and the creamy texture of Murg Korma was awesome. My 1st reaction was  THIS IS THE BEST BIRTHDAY LUNCH I EVER HAD ... 
The platter was too much for me, Me and my 1 friend had 1 platter... and am planning to taste this platter again.

a bright and vibrant outlet at the Acropolis food court with a naming that tells you exactly what food to expect.... we ordered a gosht biriyani that was served with lachha onions freshly cut,  a light raita and biriyani with a piece of potato, egg and a small piece of mutton.... honestly,  i expected much tastier biriyani which was charged at 270..... it was extremely dry and not seasoned properly..... the mutton piece was small and dry and again bland in taste.... the biriyani was light and thats how most dum pukht lucknawi biriyanis are but this one lacked the punch for sure..... their combos looked good value for money and probably i should have gone for that.....

It is very sad to say that Acropolis Mall, Kasba doesn't have a good Biriyani joint in the food court. The biriyani that was served in Mughal Sarai, it was totally disastrous and awful. It was bland, dry and absolutely nothing close to what one call as Biriyani. Moreover they don't have anything for side dish. It was totally a pile of bad food.

Been to this place because i was hungry and ordered an awadi murgh biriyani and  the moment i took the first spoon of rice in my mouth magic happened ........my hunger was gone .......I'm sure it was a printing mistake in their menu as this must be written as awadi white rice with chicken kabab shreds and an egg n alu ... Because thats what it was .The biriyani served here is an insult to even the 40₹ plate biriyani in the street ....if this food was served in prisons in india im sure crime would reduce in india for the fear of having to eat this if you are imprisoned.and i gave a 1 in the rating because the app doesn't have an option in negative

Got really excited when i saw they have kabab paranthas on their menu, ordered and got disappointed. The kebabs are suppose to be melt in mouth soft and full of flavour. The parantha is supposed to be layered and soft. Both the things did not meet the standards of actual mughlai kabab parantha. Though it was edible it wasnt even close to my expectations! Mughal Sarai you need to get your recipes right!

Yestterday I went to Acropolis Mall with my friends and ordered the Awadhi Murg Biriyani from Mughal Sarai. The term biriyani added to the name of the dish is in itself contradictory.We had difficulty in figuring out if it was really Biriyani or some white rice and semi fried chicken garnished with Beresta. I wonder how people are saying in the review section that the Biriyani was too good. In case you are trying to experiment it with the biriyani of some other region, then I feel that the attempt was extremely disappointing. Therefore take into account the quality and recipe of the food from now on.

Picked up a Rashmi butter masala thali 

The chicken  was beautifully cooked, the daal case velvety and smooth and the na and was thin and crisp. Great work! Even the portion sizes are quite good.

Situated in Acropolis Mail this place is such a place where you go when you have absolutely gone nuts over hunger. The delicacies.... well I won't say, it is bad but could has been a little better. I tried their Awadhi Murg biriyani it came out surprisingly well, much better than my expectations. The authentic biriyani rice was properly mixed with its white "sort" but didn't kill the taste of it. The meat chunks were not cooked half witted and properly blended with the rice. The quantity was also good definitely sufficient for one person. But somewhere as I said it could had been a little better. Coming to the service.. well the counter was prompt and yes the food was served hot with the delicious "raita". The staffs were polite and I will say upto the mark. Coming to the dining area... nothing much to say about it... it remains the same "uncomfortable". The experience I will not say was bad, it was okay, but could had been a little better.

I went to Acropolis Mall with my family for shopping and was hungry at the end of it. The food court of Acropolis Mall has good number of stalls available and I wanted to have North Indian. This is at the end of the floor and like other stalls of the food court this is also a self service one. We were 3 and ordered 2 combo meals which tasted average , nothing special. The other options looked good but most of them were not available at 8:30 on a Sunday evening which was pretty surprising. Service was okay. Thanks to the seating arrangement of the mall which I found the only good thing. Overall a very average experience.

This is a small food joint in the Acropolis Mall. But I am sure their North Indian food will satisfy your taste buds. I have always ordered from here whenever I went to Acropolis mall and they never failed me.

I used to have the combo meal that includes two laccha parathas / baby nun and chicken tikka masala. The chicken tikka masala is too good to be true. The chicken was fresh and so tender and so muvh tasty you will definitely crave for some more.

Hope to try their biryani next. A nice food joint though I feel the quantity of the food is on the lesser side. Otherwise a good place to hop to have a nice meal.

Ambience is cool with nice sitting arrangenents at the food court.

Service is swift with nice staffs.

Didn't went for Main course, just tried Murg Hariyali Tikka, which was nice but still nothing to boast for. Tasted better in other places.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

This is the mughlai section at the food court of Acropolis Mall. Its self service just like any other food court of any mall and the serving time ranges from 5-15 mins. Apart from the regular menu items, they also provide combo meals which I find a good option for a full meal. Had tried their non veg combo. It had rice,roti,papad,daal,veggies and chicken. Everything on that platter was tasty and not undercooked.  Good meal experience :-)

This food counter is located at the food court of Acropolis mall. Under the proprietorship of 6 Ballygunge place, this joint serves limited dishes. I had tried Sialkoti Murg tikka and Murg malai kebab, both taste decent. They serve food pretty quick.  Recommended for those, seeking quick light meal.

Located in the food court of Acropolis Mall, Mughal Sarai serves a moderate array of mughlai dishes. The taste and flavor is obviously better than other fast food joints, but for a mall eatery, there is room for huge improvement. I ordered a half chicken tandoori, which was good enough when coupled with the salad and the pudina chutney. Next came the Hyderabadi Chicken biryani, which was decent enough in quantity and taste. But then again, as I said, there is room for improvement, and they must work on it. Will visit again soon to try out some other dishes.

We had ordered 2 dishes of awadhi murgh biriyani which consisted of four pieces boneless chicken,egg and aloo accompanied with raita.Even though the food was good and less oily but the waiter disappointed us by saying that one plate could be shared.So we had ordered two for three people and were short of rice.I would request them to please not make this mistake of fooling us again.

Murg briyani for my hydrabadi friend nd cholle bhature for me in lunch was the easiest choice amongst the menu mughal sarai was offering. The food was hot, tasty and clean. Briyani tasted good , atleast for me as it didn't had those extra ghee thing in it..(many wont like it, due to less ghee) ,served vd plain raita ,(cud have been khera r boondi ka raita), no salad vd d briyani was served.. bhature was fresh and soft but I found d cholle a lil bit on d salty side.  D salad served vd it was not worthy .. achar r lemon was missing.. but d bhature did taste good

For once an outlet in a food court doesn't disappoint....In fact it delivers what it promises, that is, good North Indian food. The ingredients used were of good quality and that showed in the end result.... the food, which was tasty and delicious. I loved what I had here and will surely try other dishes here in future. Loved the tandoori aloo and panir tikka. The masala kulcha came piping hot and was great. Good Food.... Keep it up!!

Situated in the acropolis mall, it does not have many options to decorate it on their own.
Seeing the menu while we are walking past the counters, were the names of the kebabs and the biriyani they offered.
So we took a plate of chicken kebab( I m sorry ,I forgot the name and their menu in zomato doesnot contain that name, it might be a tikka kebab) and a plate of biriyani.
The kebab came with a handful of chutney and salad and tasted good.
I wish the biriyani could have been made more succulent.It was very dry, with a very stiff chicken piece.
If I go there , I can try kababs rather than biriyani.

I have been a fan of Mughal Sarai for some time now. Their non veg combo especially their treatment of the meat, the portion size and the overall behavior is truly great. I normally have their mutton peshawari which is really nice and if the need arises later you can always have another naan.

They do not have half the dishes that are there on their menu.  That's disappointing.   Otherwise, the chole bhature is decent and filling.  The biriyani is not too great but not too bad either.  Staff isn't very friendly.  They most definitely should improve their customer handling skills.

As the name suggests this outlet sells their North Indian products to all. Mughal Sarai is one of the food counter outlet at the Acropolis Mall food court.

They sell some exotic kebabs as well as gravy dishes with the help of parathas, Rotis and different types of rice as well. I tried tangri Kebab which was good in taste also grabbed a bite of their Paratha and a gravy which was decent in taste.

Only problem I could find that they don't have much options as combo as because I m telling this people tend to try combo platters more than ala carte items at any food court. So I think management will surely take this note into their account.

A special thanks to Ujwal Choudhary and the acropolis mall management to be such wonderful hosts.

There we entered booming up with all energy and Mughal Sarai was lined for the last. The last however was a real popper. Mughal Sarai is the first station which marks the beginning of Uttar Pradesh. So North Indian food is the call. Initially this outlet started off serving chaats which is a very famous part of the North Indian palate. In no time, keeping in mind the demands of people and unavailability of North Indian cuisine in the mall, they launched in their Awadhi, which proved to be quite beneficial. A lot of spices and aroma is the USP of North indian cuisine. 

Decor and Ambience - this is the usual mall Ambience that we can expect. People hustling bustling past. In malls we generally look for the food and a place to sit where we can converse for agea, and that is what is available.

Staffs: the staffs were enough courteous helping us choose the menu that we desired to. The chef also gave in his input to make the end of our food journey worth remembering.

Food: coming to the food of course, we had quite a lot of choice.
Starters:
1. Bharwa aloo - this is what you call innovative approach to make North Indian cuisine even taste better. This was masala potato, curbed in from the middle to fill in the cheese stuffing. This enhanced the taste by neutralising the spices. A lovely way of starting. indeed recommended.

2. Mixed chat - the mixed chat had a generous portion. The chat was indeed tangy and chatpata. However, I felt the crisp was somewhere missing.

3. Tandoori chicken - the tandoori chicken was however a surprise. The tandoor was done quite well. And considering , i was having tandoori chicken after ages and the pudina chutney as the accompaniment, it created a whole new tickle in the taste buds. 

Main Course:
1. Chicken bharta and pudina paratha - the chicken bharta was excellent. The amount of spices was just too correct. The shredded chicken pieces just melted in the mouth. The pudina paratha along with the bharta tasted heavenly.

2. Handi gosht lazeez and masala kulcha - the masala kulcha was one of its kind. Soft and supple, it melted in the mouth. The handi gosht as was expected was not served in handi, which was a meagre disappointment. However, on tasting I felt the magic of mutton spiced so well, that ot effortlessly melted in the mouth. A definitive suggestion.

3. Sabzi biryani and mixed veg - I have never dared to taste veg biryani in my life.

Acropolis Mall and it's food court, which gives the visitors, a myriad range of choices, is the place to be if one wants to dig into the mouth-watering dishes that 'Mughal Sarai' has to offer. Mughal Sarai has some amazing 'combo' offers that is pocket-friendly and other wide range of calorie-laden dishes that is sure to make the inner-foodie happy and satiated. Overall, a good option to eat out at, if one wants to enjoy the lively ambience of the new mall. Ps. The combo of Peshawari Chicken and butter mini Naan is a must try. The desi finger-licking good food.

Mughal Sarai was a Chaat place before, and then overnight it either expanded the menu (smart move, though!) or changed management into becoming a more full fledged Mughlai- North Indian eating place. Upon

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
Mughal Sarai, Please pay attention people this is not the railway station junction what we know. This is a fine food kiosk at a food court. Deals with the Mughal cuisines this place is at the Acropolis Mall food court at Kasba. There are lots of other big names beside this kiosk so this place has been a bit gone over shadowed as said by my fellow foodie friend friend. 
Went there with Team #PanchPhoron as been invited by the Acropolis mall management for the food tasting.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
Its a food court again and is common sitting with self service.

FOOD AND DRINKS:
We tried the following items as follows:

1. Mix Chaat - Mix Chaat was nice. Decorated well. Quantity of the chaat was quite good.

2. Bharwan Aloo - Bharwan Aloo was a stater. Stuffed potato wrapped in. Sizes are small but a good one for the veggies.

3. Chicken Bharta - Chicken Bharta was delightful. Everyone liked it. The chicken need to shredded more but the gravy was thick and tasty.

4. Sabz Biryani - Sabz biryani was a decent dish. Taste was very good and tasted like biryani.

5. Handi Gosht Lazeez - Handi Lazeez was indeed very lazeez. The gravy was again thick and very tasty. The peices were good in numbers and good in quanity. The mutton was soft and juicy.

6. Pudina Paratha - Pudina paratha was nice. Soft and going well with both Handi Lazeez and Bharta.

7. Masala Kulcha - Masala Kulcha is been a better thing always to try with the gravy dishes. And this Kulcha did the justice to the gravy dishes.

8. Mix Veg - Mix veg really surprised us. A place famous for Non veg can be so good in veg dishes was not expected.

9. Tandooru Murgh - Tandoori Murgh was a good one. But it was a bit dry and lil bit burnt somewhere. Thou the taste was good but need to be more softer and juicy inside.

QNQ AND PRICES: 
Quality and quantity were all good and fine. Just need to be a bit careful while ordering bharwan aloo because of it sizes. Otherwise all the other dishes are upto the mark.

CONCLUSION:
Tasting non veg dishes is always fun but if you get to taste the veg also it a bonus. We were happy to taste both the variety the same day. The experience was a satisfactory.
Again like to thanks Acropolis Mall Management for inviting us and giving us the honour.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Convocation 2016. Day 0.

Catched up with a few seniors who wanted to watch the Batman v/s Superman movie. So we made our way to Acropolis Mall, where we headed for the famous north Indian restaurant. 

Mughal Sarai had many Indian and Mughlai dishes on offer. We ordered the following 
1. Murgh Tikka Masala with Laccha Paratha
2. Murgh Tikka Masala with Naam
3. Chhole Bhature.

Quantities were enough to kill the hunger. The taste was good and the gravy reminded of the Delhi dhabas. The breads are something they can work upon. But all in all, good Indian meals were on offer.

Mughal Sarai is the outlet in the Acropolis Food Court which serves, no point for guessing, 'Mughal' food.
Recently was invited over as part of #PanchPhoron for a food audit. Tried some of their dishes, brief review of which are given below.

1. Bharwa Aloo and Mixed Chat:
The mixed chat was flavorful & ample in quantity.
The bharwa aloo which as the name implies is stuffed potato is a starter. tastes great but the amount is quite less, so order accordingly.

2. Tandoori Chicken
This dish does not need a description. size of the chicken is good, taste is standard. But it seemed a notch dry. Juicier tandooris are always enjoyed better.

3. Chicken Bharta & Pudina Paratha
Absolutely gorgeous. Note that quantity of bharta was generous.

4. Handi Gosht Lazeez & Masala Kulcha
The handi gosht to our disappointment was not served in a handi. Shortcoming of a food court takeaway I guess. Tasted great nonetheless. Masala kulcha too was tasty & soft.

5. Subj Biryani & mixed veg.
For the rice we chose the veg biryani. & were we impressed! One of the best veg. biryani I had till date. The aroma was so flavorful that we mistook it for chicken biryani for a second. The mixed veg too was good, no complaints there.

All in all it was a great experience. Finding such well made mughlai food in a food court of a shopping mall is quite surprizing. Congrats to the team of Mughalsarai for keeping the items flavorful yet value for money. & thanks to the acropolis management for inviting us over.Next time I'm near Kasba, & craving for a mughlai dish, surely I'll head towards Mughalsarai.
Till then
happy eating.
Cheers

Mughal Sarai, as the name suggests, serves a wide variety of Mughlai cuisines. It is a kiosk in the food court of Acropolis Mall. I was invited here as a member of #Panchphoron to taste some of the dishes.

We started with Bharwa Aloo and mixed chat. The potato in Bharwan aloo was grilled perfectly and tasted good. The mixed chat was also well made and tasty.

The full plate of tandoori chicken, which we ordered next, looked tempting. It tasted good, however the chicken was a little dry.

Among pudina paratha and masala kulcha, I liked the paratha as it was very very soft and the pudina flavour was prominent. The kulcha was not very soft and the masala stuffing was not up to the mark.

The next range of dishes which we had were brilliant. The chicken bharta was served in a bowl in huge quantity. The gravy was rich, creamy with minced chicken pieces, topped with three slices of egg.

Handi ghost lazeez was equally well. The mutton was soft and perfectly cooked. The aroma of this dish was mouthwatering and it tasted very good.

Mixed veg was also well made. The veggies like cauliflower, potato, etc were present in a thick and tasty gravy. Being a hardcore non vegetarian, this dish appealed to me as much as the chicken bharta and the ghost lazeez did.

Subz biryani was one of the best versions of veg biryani I had till date. Thin and flavourful grains of rice were cooked perfectly, along with cauliflower, beans, carrots, peas, etc. It went very well with the chicken and mutton dishes. A must try over here !

I would like to thank the management of Acropolis Mall for the invitation !

The nomenclature of this eatery is a total failure. their food certainly do not possess any Mughlai features you can think of. In a metro like Kolkata where Biriyani is something which people figuratively worship, they have successfully managed to ruin it in every possible way. What they serve is not biriyani but a concoction of tasteless spices, a small chicken portion and rice. Needless to say that there is no aroma in the biriyani. But they have made great efforts to serve onion rings and carrot slices and raita (they call it raita, but it isn't). Prices are very high. Food quality and service is just as worse as you can imagine.

If I am not wrong, this food joint was named as 'Chaat' when it newly opened, or maybe it got merged with that outlet or something because now they have a combined menu of North Indian items and some street food as well.

The food kiosk in Acropolis Mall is basically famous for street foods rather than their Biryani and other North Indian food. I have seen most of the people ordering chaats rather than the Biryanis.

Anyways, tried their Papdi Chaat and Aloo Tikki Chaat. Costing ₹90 and ₹80 respectively, nothing really fancy but descent enough. All the spices were adequate. Aloo Tikki Chaat was more like channa masala chaat, quite spicy as well. Papdi Chaat was descent and cool enough with adequate amount of dahi (curd). Quantity was sufficient, only for one person. Service was mediocre.

They do have a takeaway facility, but the packaging is very poor. They use cheap tin foil containers which tend to leak, so packing chaats or other gravy items is not a good idea. Also they didn't provide any plastic spoon with the chaat that I packed for home.

This is 6BP outlet. But M-Biryani at 228 with only one piece and average quality. Seems people will have an option if they want to have Biryani.
