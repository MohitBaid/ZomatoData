Yesterday visited this restaurant at camac street on 5th floor of westside building.
Talwari Murgh Malai kebab was superb. Just the perfect taste and flavour. Must try.
Staffs were courteous and polite.
Decor and ambience inside was also good.
Great Experience indeed.

We.Desi the ambience & the theme of the restaurant is styled up in Desi way the lights, fans, wall & leg stand.
We had a buffet lunch on a Sunday for the veg 3 starters from which Tandoori Stuffed Aloo & Paneer was the best. In the buffet spread Macroni Salad was one of its kind. Kashmiri Aloo Dum & Malai Kofta with Butter Naan, after this a bit of Steamz Veg Pulao. In the desert section there was Hot Gulab Jamun very soft & yummy. With Choco chips having Vanilla ice cream was the last thing to do. Tutti Frutti was also an option to have

Suitably located at the fifth floor of the Pantaloons building on Camac Street, this place has some delectable dishes to offer on your plate. Do try their Amritsari Kulcha, it's hands down the best in the city. I am not kidding. All the other dishes are pretty good too, but the kulcha deserved a special mention. The mocktails section of the menu needs a fair bit of work. Do visit this place for their Amritsari Kulchas and the papad ke kebabs. 
Happy dining!

If you are bore of having buffets at bbq nation we desi is the second best choice...they serve a complimentary drink which include either a soft drink or a  pint of beer.. the starters are just mouth watering....unlike other restaurants they mainly focusses on their main course items in the buffet. From soups to deserts  each and every items are  just perfect for the tastebuds...coming to the decorations one will feel of having lunch at a old heritage room of Calcutta....

Me and my friends went there to avail the lunch buffet today.
The ambience was nice. I would give it 4stars for sure.

The staffs were very much courteous. Again 4stars.

Service: the staffs were prompt but the service was still slow because of the live starters. Around 20 people took buffet, it wasn't  that much busy, still It was impossible to serve the starters to all tables on time, so the service was getting slowed, though I must say the chef at the counter and the service staffs were attentive and trying there best. 3.5stars.

Food: coming to the food. The buffet was worth the money. The food was good but I can't say extraordinary. The thing which I liked is that all of the items were light but flavorful. 3.8stars for the food.

Now you can ask why I'm giving 3.5stars.

The problem arrived with the bill. I think the management doesn't know that service charge is the amount paid by customers voluntarily , you can't fix the rates. Our bill was 3270, so they charged 10% service charge and they charged 5%GST on that too. 
So after seeing this I opposed and immediately the manager came and gave us a refreshed bill without applying service charge. 
I know that service charge is taken for the welfare of staffs but 10%? And GST was charged on the service charge too.
All the foodies, please know what are you paying for.

So my friend gifted me a lunch buffet pass for we.desi. Wasn't sure much about this place. But it is one hell.of a good place. Actually among the best places I have been to. The ambience was on point, giving that desi feel, and definitely good choice of music. The starters were good. I loved the chicken kebabs and my friend hogged all the fish and seekh kebabs.
For the main course there were plenty of items to choose from, which can easily confuse a normal being. But the best part was the desserts. 
I'm definitely going to visit this place again.

This place is really really awesome. From decoration to quality of food, everything was just perfect. Opted for buffet and I can assure that they have one of the best pocket friendly buffet spread in town. Got bored of barbqnation nd sigree, so tried this place for the 1st time and they amazed me. Fish, mttn nd chkn kebabs were mouth watering. The best main course spread including well decorated veg and nonveg salads. They served fish, chicken, mutton, kofta, bengan, mixed veg, alu, nd other stuff I dont remember. But each and every dosh was noteworthy. A total paisa vasool buffet. Tgey provided complimentary beer/soda/coje. phirni, kheer, gulabjamun, icecream for desert. The best pastry I ever had in a buffet. A five star!!!!

There is nothing negative to write down about this place. Everything is fine and upto the mark. We did not face any trouble. Being a large group of around 20 people we would have had some sort of difficulties if we would have gone anywhere else but here everything was well maintained.

Decor - Amazing.

People/staff - More amazing and very friendly in terms of everything possible.

Food - Awesome. Starters were really heavenly.

Service - Good.

What else can you expect. If they can cater to such a large group as us and fulfill all our possible wishes then they are really excellent. Half of us were food critics but we had no problems. The place is huge and this is situated on the same place where there used to be Grain of Salt and then Ivory. Both were equally excellent. We Desi continues the legacy of excellence.

Highly recommended by me. Must visit and to be highly enjoyed in all ways.

If you're a kebab lover then you gotta visit We Desi ASAP!!!


Starters:
Talwari murg malai kebab-The most succulent kebab I've had till date..it will melt in your mouth like butter the moment you take a bite..every bite of this kebab was unbelievably flavoursome and scrumptious..You will be speechless!!

Chicken Nizami Tangdi: Another gem of a starter!Chicken tangdis smeared with a yummy white sauce and stuffed with crumbled cheese is one of the best tangdi kebabs I've had!

Square foot mutton seekh: This thick seekh of mutton kebab was soft and deliciously spicy!

Main course:
Ivory shaam savera-spinach koftas stuffed with cottage cheese cooked in yummy makhani gravy was delish!!!

Pathani paneer lababdar-Rich and creamy red gravy based paneer dish that was spicy and had a hint of smokiness which i loved!

Chicken Parda biryani-This one took my breath away!It had two pieces of chicken and one boiled egg..the biryani was beautifully infused with the flavors of spices..was overloaded with ghee which just sent my taste buds to a trance!

Dessert:
Nolen gur ka Sandook:The star of their dessert menu!A thick square shaped slab of chocolate cake stuffed with a delectable nolen gurer shondesh..it was topped with small little squares of dark and white chocolate and was placed over creamy nolen gur!!!The cake was soft and yummy but it was the sondesh in the centre that drove me nuts!!!chocolate and nolen gur does taste good together!!!
A ripper of a dessert!!!

Baked gulab jamun with burnt orange sorbet:Sliced baked gulab jamun placed between two slices of fried bread which had two scoops of orange sorbet on top!The sorbet was yum..this concoction was extremely pleasing!!!

Nutty chocolate Patakha:A yummy block of ice cream covered with a chocolate shell garnished with nuts will be loved by every ice cream crazy person!

Decor and ambience: Went for dinner and was floored by the place at first sight!!
This place has a retro style decor!
the chequered floor and tables, the old school switch boards on the wall,antique fan showpiece kept on the table and other decoratives are so cool!!!
It was dimly lit up and some soft old bollywood songs were being played that created a very relaxing atmosphere!

The staff needs to be lavishly praised as they were extremely warm,welcoming and friendly!!!
They take really good care of their customers to the extent that they end up feeling pampered!!!

We Desi is truly amazing!!!

We went there solely on the basis of recommendations and we loved it. 😁We availed the buffet. The starters was outstanding. We were served Chicken, fish and Mutton kebab all of them were fresh and toothsome. Same goes for the Desserts. Now coming to the mains and the soup it can be improved. The mutton Saag was a bit hard and the soup was salty.

Overall an amazing experience and double thums Up for the service. The staffs were very polite and welcoming. Thank you We. Desi :)

I was around this area and checked on  Zomato for  restaurants nearby while i was standing in front of this building.  So all is well in this place, the service is extraordinary.  They explained the food suggested alternatives. We had the buffet and it was worth it.  This is the first time i even took pictures.  I highly recommend this place for good north Indian food. 

Nothing different but regular food done right served well.

We opted for non-veg lunch buffet. The food was tasteless except the chicken starter. And there is possibility that the food was stale as the restaurant was empty during the buffet hours so don't have any idea what they do with the large amount of the leftover food may be serve tomorrow again and after that also.

Family visit. Nice atmosphere. No issues with parking. Dedicated elevators. Greeted warmly. Clean and roomy with agreeable decor. Good service. We opted for the buffet. The starters were tasty. Not much choice, but when you also have lovely chaat and jaljira with freshly cooked kebabs hot from the range, I haven't any complaints. Food was steaming hot and tasty. Perfect naans served at the table. My only issue was with the desserts. A little more variety, and the ice cream needn't be served scoop wise at the table when you have the hot chocolate sauce elsewhere. Just leave it the ice cream in containers for people to help themselves. 
I suggest taking a windowside table.

Now coming to the food...we preferred buffet over al la carte.. There were wide variety of menu starting from starter having fish, chicken, mutton kebabs along with soup and drinks proceeded with main course and also desserts.. The chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. 

The staff were very hostile nd also tried their best level to exchange kind words with their customers..

I highly recommend everyone to go nd try the food here... it made us to feel..... " WE DESI"

Desserts were also good and reasonably priced - 1 beer or soft drink along with a buffet is worth a price. I ttoaly enjoyed snacks with what we punjabis call - GOLGAPPE 😀😜

Let me start this off by saying that this is probably among the top 5 desserts I've had till now. 
The Chocolate Patakha was presented in such a way that I was almost hesitant to use my spoon and break open the beautiful dish in front of me. Coming to the food dish itself, a chocolate shell topping with coffee ice cream in the middle and a cookie at the bottom melts together in your mouth making you feel like you're in heaven.
And the foods are not the only good part about this place, the ambience inside along with the decorations goes very well to make you have a good time while eating the good food. The staffs were very good in making sure that I was comfortable and that only adds to the positive feelings I had for the place.
Even though it was slightly on the expensive side of things, a dessert is not the only thing I want out such a place and I'm looking forward to my next visit at We.Desi.

Excellent food ! Nice ambience and good service ! Location is convinient too, situated just next to shisha bar stock exchange, Camac street.
For starters we ordered a veg platter which was quite tasty and for the main course we ordered Dal, Kadhai paneer masala , kofta and Amritsari pindi chhole , all of which were delicious !
Amritsari kulcha was my personal favourite ..
Food quality , ambience and courteous staff made the experience a bang on...!
Price is little on a higher side , but it's worth every penny...would definitely visit this place again !

Went for a Sunday Lunch buffet. Got a good nearbuy deal for it. The buffet spread was quite decent.
We got a welcome drink of either beer/soft drink, along with a plate of chaat from the live chaat counter.
Apart from the soups, the starters comprised of Fish Ajwaini Tikka, Chicken Tikka and Mutton Sheekh kebabs, all of which were prepared live before serving and were very flavourful.
There were 4-5 varieties of salads, while the main course consisted of two varieties of rice, 3 veg preparations including paneer, 3 non veg preparations of chicken, fish and mutton. To top of all off, there were six varieties of desserts including Gajar ka Halwa, Strawberry Mousse, Rosogolla, Icecream etc.
Overall it was a good experience. A Sunday well spent.

The service is very poor. The starters served at first were not cooked properly but subsequent repeated rounds were tasty. Main course had limited options but food was tasty. The dessert was the worst part. Had this kind of bad dessert after really long time! Seriously, they need some improvement and improvisation from their end.

Located just beside the Mac street pantaloons , Westside building 5th floor.its easy to find location is a plus point. We visited this place on a Saturday to grab our lunch.opted for their buffet lunch (nonveg). They served us three types of kebabs (chicken ,mutton and fish) all of which are equally delicious. I did not  go for their main course and  helped myself with their salads. Bt the salads disappointed me big time. Only the pasta  salad was edible. Fish salad and chicken salads were stale and tasteless and the corn salad was full of rotten cornns. But their desserts are quite good. I liked their kheer rasgulla the most .gazar ka halwa and firni was tasty and I helped myself with a second serving .over all it's a good dining experience.

Located next to sShisha- bse, it is a stop for many.
It serves North Indian and a variety of starters.
I had ordered quite a few dishes but my experience was not a very pleasant one. Firstly, I felt the staff was courteous but very slow in service.
The ambience was okay, nothing to be mentioned about.
The food is a little over priced, specially considering  the the taste of food.
Coming to food- I liked the zatar naan the most. Something different and refreshing in taste.
Bun ghughni was good.
We.desi paneer cigar is a big no. It has a very blank taste, not a good option to choose.
In desserts, the chocolate patakha is really good. It gives a full load of chocolate and crunches.
The chia seed panacotta is a big no. If you are a panacotta fan, please do not try here, you'll stop liking it.
The presentation of desserts, however, is good.

Kolkata never seems to stop amazing foodies, and I was also happily surprised after visiting this restaurant. Discovered We.Desi from Zomato itself and went there for an office party, and the visit experience was truly amazing.

The good -
i. Ambience - truly a one of a kind decor. Lights guised as kerosene​lamps, old chubby electrical switches, old photos - all of these give out a retro-modern-fusion outlook.
ii. Staff - As courteous as can be. The service was also prompt.
iii. Food - We went for the buffet and it was a true shocker. In starters chicken kebab, fish tandoori, mutton kebab all were extremely well prepared. But the best aspect of the buffet was the main course. Very few all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants provide a good main course, and We.Desi is truly one of them. It was an absolute delight to have luchi and kosha mangsho, the chicken and fish salad were also good.
The options in the dessert was a large one, kesar sandesh, firni and gulab jamun were truly memorable.

The bad -
Strictly speaking there was not a single thing to complain about. But for the sake of nitpicking I will have to add that they do charge a service charge, the point of having such a thing baffles me. The management offered a special corporate discount too, so it was balanced out for us.

Overall, I would strongly recommend foodies to try the buffet here at least once. It will not be a disappointment. I for one will be surely visiting this place again. Good job guys, keep it up.

Located just beside the Mac street pantaloons , Westside building 5th floor.its easy to find location is a plus point. We visited this place on a Saturday to grab our lunch.opted for their buffet lunch (nonveg). They served us three types of kebabs (chicken ,mutton and fish) all of which are equally delicious. I did not  go for their main course and  helped myself with their salads. Bt the salads disappointed me big time. Only the pasta  salad was edible. Fish salad and chicken salads were stale and tasteless and the corn salad was full of rotten cornns. But their desserts are quite good. I liked their kheer rasgulla the most .gazar ka halwa and firni was tasty and I helped myself with a second serving .over all it's a good dining experience.

Located next to sShisha- bse, it is a stop for many.
It serves North Indian and a variety of starters.
I had ordered quite a few dishes but my experience was not a very pleasant one. Firstly, I felt the staff was courteous but very slow in service.
The ambience was okay, nothing to be mentioned about.
The food is a little over priced, specially considering  the the taste of food.
Coming to food- I liked the zatar naan the most. Something different and refreshing in taste.
Bun ghughni was good.
We.desi paneer cigar is a big no. It has a very blank taste, not a good option to choose.
In desserts, the chocolate patakha is really good. It gives a full load of chocolate and crunches.

Today had a buffet lunch with friends, got a good deal from nearbuy. Food was really good. Also less impact on pocket. Servicw was good until we received a bill of 130 inr for 2 one ltr of mineral water bottle. The mrp was 20 inr per bottle still they charged 50 inr per bottle. Also added service charge. Which came to a total of 130 inr. I guess we can take thia forward to concumer forum , though still took it as ouja tips for them. Please avoid this kind of messes while billing.

This is the month of festive time, and we all know that few days left before puja. like every other restaurant “We.Desi” which is a quite well-known restaurant in the city, proudly introduced some of the signature dishes during this year puja. This place serves some really good North Indian and South Indian dishes at a reasonable price. located near Camac Street Pantaloons, 5th floor of the Westside building. from the entrance, you will notice this restaurant quite spacious, can accommodate 55-60 people at a time. The whole decor cover by the blackish colored theme with extraordinary lighting effects. The very next to the chair and tables there is a buffet counter. well, moving on a foodie meetup arranged by the management of “We.Desi” especially for us to cover the entire menu and the foods which they will serve during puja time.

I'm in love with this place, like literally! They've the perfect ambience, extremely well behaved and friendly staff and now coming to the most important part - the food.
We took the lunch buffet last day which was a Saturday. For drinks we were served beer and a coke and then Golgappa with two different flavors of juice with a green chutney. Next to that we were served three kinds of kebabs and all three of them were equally delicious. Then came the main course and there were too many dishes to choose from. In the dessert section my favorite would be the Gulab Jamun. Overall I loved each and every dish. This place is highly recommended. The only thing which is a little annoying is that they charge extra 10% service tax but then we were so damn happy with the food and service, so we ignored that part.
Happy dinning :)

When I went to we.desi,I went with a lot of expectations. The reviews I read were nice and this place was highly recommended by my wife.But I was disappointed with the food.punjabi kadhi was not up to the mark at all and I did politely tell them about it.i expected them to cancell it but they turned a deaf ear.the mutton Rogan josh was not tender.and the gravy was not like Rogan josh.the only thing good was mutton seekh. They need to buck up.fancy presentation is not a substitute to tasty food.

After a long wait finally went to this place on a saturday evening. The place looks beautiful in black and white. The checkered tables arranged in the gallery like alleyway, with good lighting and proper space in between brings a queer charm to the place. The menu speaks the wide range of potential the indian cuisine has. The desi cuisine in the videshi manner.
Tried broccoli shorba and tomato shorba, served with nan crackers, and also papdi chat, stuffed cigars and paneer tikka as starters. Which were nice, nothing very great.
Cola float mojito and strawberry fizz were good.
For main course we had shaam savera, dal makhani and pindi chana with garlic naan, masala kulcha and jeera rice. The food was again, good but not very fascinating. The presentation and service was top notch. The experience was good. Extra credits only for the ambience and service.

This is not a paid nor a biased review. 

My family of four including myself decided to go to Wedesi assuming it would be quite similar to Barbecue Nation but unfortunately our experience was rather terrible.

Please note that I feel it is imperative to mention the differences in order to point out the various flaws. 

After reaching the venue, the first thing we noticed is that it was empty. Hoping we were probably the first to visit at 1:30 pm, we continued on to the table. 

We noticed the table was very dirty with sticky liquid on it. We pointed that out and were told to move to another table. We picked the table near the bar area which was comparatively clean.

Based on the fine experience at Barbecue Nation, we were treated rather sloppily. The servers were slow, unclear, and mostly idled around.

Moving on to the food, the chicken starter was good. Everything else failed to please in a miserable way.

Shockingly, after we got up for the buffet menu, we discovered the lack of variety, which was soon followed up by the utter lack of taste. Many items mentioned in the menu were unavailable and when we questioned the absence of biryani and other items, the shallow reply was that the menu changes everyday.

Overall, this outlet left me and my family with a bad taste in our minds. Out of everything we tasted, the only good things were the lime soda and the chicken starter. We will most likely never visit this place again unless there is a massive renovation in the curriculum, attitude and cookery. Oh yeah, the 3500 rupees spent felt like a waste.

Food - You will be getting the most eye catching presentation of food here. Excellent quality food. Excellent taste. Firstly you will be getting a complementary chaat papad which is tangy and spicy. We ordered for dhuandaar murg shorba; an ultimate bliss for shorba lovers. For starters we tried talwari murg malai kebab (juicy and a perfect stater), tandoori jhinga ke diye (recommended), ajwain mahi tikka (recommended). For main course we wechose plain rice and kerala prawn moilee, the best dish one can imagine of! Other dishes were naan with chicken curry. The We.Desi signature dessert nolen goor ka sandook is something unique indeed. For mocktails we chose kala khatta mojito and vanilla cola float.

Ambience - Well decorated and a nice place.

Service - Helpful and friendly staff.

Rate - Appropriate.

Tried We Desi for a family dinner on a weekday. The occupancy was low as expected. The menu offers some Kolkata staple items as starters, served in varied and innovative ways. The taste lets you down and the presentation is forgotten. The main course....both the dal, veggies and breads were very very oily. Visitors must specifically request for low oil food. The portions are small. The pricing is comparatively high if compared to peer group. It appears that the management focus is more on decor and presentation than on the food itself. More attention to the taste factor would ensure patrons pay return visits. The service was decent though. At present worth a try

Map of India will drag you to click a selfie too. Service is really warm and welcoming. Decor is elegant. By the name of the food in menu all of them sound exotic but are average. 
We had ordered for Tomato Shorba and Brocoli aur kaju Shorba with Paneer Moti in soup. 
We.Desi papad aur pyaz in salad.
Golgappe and bharwan golgappa in chaatwaala.
Aloo ki tashkari and paneer tikka in starters. 
Many of the items i dont remember in main course and drinks. 
Overall experience was good at We.Desi.

One things is good that price are corrected. This is one the oldest restuarant which has changed with time. From Grain of salt - Ivory - WeDesi.

We.Desi is located on the 5th floor of West Side on Camac Street. The decor has an old world charm with chequered floors, wooden tables, portraits of Indian royalty with old Hindi songs playing. It serves a buffet of Indian food exclusively. The staff is courteous and service is prompt. The meal began with a papri chaat and three kebabs-fish, chicken and mutton. The chat was surprisingly good. All the starters were excellent and impeccably prepared. A round of soft drink/beer is also included in the buffet. Along with the starters we were also served Chicken Badami shorba which had a nice flavour. For main course, there were two choices of rice-steamed and onion pulao, chicken lahori, fish and mutton curries (can't remember their names). Out of all the dishes the mutton was the show stealer, being well cooked and having the right amount of spices. They also serve roti/bread at the table. The desserts section is what let me down a bit. Apart form the moong dal halwa, walnut brownie and the tooti frooti icecream I chose there was also gulaab jamun, kheer and a couple of other Indian sweets. I found their desserts to be too sweet and the absence of other varieties of icecream except vanilla was disappointing. All in all, a good place to try out if one is looking for an affordable Indian buffet.

P.S- They charge 10% service charge in addition to the GST.

The worst place to visit. Service sucks big time. You order something, it comes after 20 minutes and then the quantity is so miniscule that as soon you have a bite it is over. And then another 20 minutes before the next order arrives. Interestingly, they took my starter's plate away after a while, and served main course after 30 minutes. In the meanwhile my friends ordered some more starters and I wondered if I could eat it because they did not give me any utensils for the 30 minutes. And to top it is the ridiculous noise from adjoining disco. But undoubtedly the worst part is the service.

Con: There is no sign indicating that there is a restaurant, I would have never known there is a restaurant, I found the place accidentally. There should be signs on the entrance and exit of the mall and in the elevator downstairs. I also forgot about the restaurant later.

Brilliant is the only word that I will use to describe the place. Visited last Sunday for the buffet lunch. I had bought the vouchers from nearbuy.com. I had called and made the reservation. Rs 649 AI for a  Sunday buffet at a place like camac street is a steal. Coming to the service. Impeccable. Each and every staff are super friendly. Catered to everything. 3 to 4 person helped us during our entire stay. They served the starters on the table. The food was amazing. In most buffets the starters and desserts are good and moan course isn't. But here each and every item was well made. I stuffed myself to the brim. Couldn't eat till the next day morning. :-P but kudos to the management and staff for the amazing experience. I will be definitely coming down again.

Ever since We.Desi has opened last year they have created a good reputation for consistently serving good quality food, unique presentation and experimenting with gastronomy. We had come here last to last month to celebrate my dad's birthday and I must say that the experience was brilliant overall. Located on the fifth floor of Camac Street Westside, We.Desi has replaced the earlier Grain Of Salt/Ivory (whichever you find familiar), next to TFO. 
The checkered floor, old school switch board, lanterns and other showpieces will surely grab a lot of attention. A giant wheel and the map of India will drag you to click a selfie too! On the other hand, service is really warm and welcoming. Music being played was old Bollywood making sure that you're triggered with enough of nostalgia. 
Finally we had settled in a corner, trying out their mouth watering delicacies one by one. We tried the following - 
Broccoli and Kaju Shorba with Paneer Moti - Didn't try this but my family did and they quite liked it. 
Talwari Murg Malai Kebab - Malai Kebabs served in skewers that were served on the table vertically resembling a Talwar. Taste wise the chicken was super tender and the malai aroma kept us satisfied. 
Malai Bharwan Kebab - A very delicious mushroom kebab that was served inside clothing iron bases. The marination was quite similar to the murg kebab but as it was mushroom the taste was quite different and beautiful. 
Ajwain Mahi Tikka - The fish kebabs were a little spicy but as the fish was very good quality, tender and well cooked, liked it very much. 
Tandoori Jhinga ke Diye - Prawns served in cute little diyas and the base of the diya was layered with a tangy seasoning similar to the ones of Aloo Kabli. Loved this dish as the prawns were brilliantly made. 
Masala Roasted Roti - Generally served with cocktails, they gave it to us complimentary and it tasted very refreshing. 
Butter Naan - The usual Butter Naan, it was soft but well cooked inside and tasted good. 
Steamed Basmati Rice - Just took a plate of it as accompaniment with the side dish. 
Kerala Prawn Moilee - The Keralite take on Prawn Malaikari, this one had a perfect aroma of the coconut milk. I have never tasted Prawn Malai Curry with onions. This was very much familiar to the Bengali version on one hand and on the other hand, the onions had bought a twist to the gravy. It was exotically brilliant in one word. 
Nolen Goor Ka Sandook - This one was complimentary from their part for my dad's birthday. This basically nolen goorer sandesh wrapped by a chocolate cake with dark and white chocolate squares on top. Very unique, tastes very nice. 
Baked Gulab Jamun with Burnt Orange Sorbet - The name states it all. Didn't like it. The whole thing was extremely sweetening making your tastebuds numb. 
Drinks - 
Vanilla Cola Float 
Watermelon Mojito 
Kala Khatta Mojito 
By the name, all of them sound very exotic but they were very average. The drinks weren't as good compared to the food. 
The overall experience was good at We.Desi. One or two items only disappointed us. I hope that they will look into this matter and improve. Otherwise there was no scope of complaint in service, ambience or any other aspect. Recommended to try and repeat. I am surely going to come back. Happy Dining! :)

The main course was simple , PUNJABI BUTTER CHICKEN  , GARLIC NAAN , BUTTER NAAN was delicious as well.
The dessert was beautiful to look at , NOLEN GUR KA SANDOOK , but failed to impress taste wise , the flavours of chocolate and nolen gur sandesh didn't go well together , hence deducted half a mark.
The staff did their job well , decor is elegant with black and white checkered tables, steel utensils in desi style , and definitely the presentation skills deserves an applause !

At first glance , you might think that this place is pretty basic but once you pay attention , you'll notice how beautiful the ambience of this place is. The food here is delicious , we had their Chicken Tikka Roll with Cutting Chai and a We.Desi Nutty Chocolate Pathaka and the latter truly won my heart. The staff here is friendly and service is prompt , nothing to complain about.

The starters were good, but the soup and main course was below average. The taste of their signature dishes like Lala musa daal, khasta roti, pindi Channa, has changed and has lost its flavour. The chaat section introduced is good but they serve many of these in aluminium boxes which after a few dishes didn't even have banana leaves spread underneath. And I am sure the boxes are not food grade. There was too much noise of utensils clattering and time and again the service people dropped them which created a lot of sound....

Wanted to book a table for lunch.No one took the call .Booked a table through zomato and got a confirmation immedietly. On arrival were implored to choose buffet. Not many options at buffet. A very usual buffet spread nothing exceptional to mention here.Bread options were very less.. (no spl request entertained too). Coming to the dessert part, I have never come back from a buffet lunch without having dessert. Nothing appealing.Very average . They served ice cream on our tables in a miniature bowl which made us laugh our heart out( the bowl was so very small to fit  in one scoop only) Upon request we were served some more such bowls. Seriously give some choice for dessert. U guys are charging a lot and options are less.

Undoubtedly a very nice location, but I found the place not up to the mark. Firstly on weekends this is not a place to go with family as you can't have loud banging music and beats from the neighbourhood disturb you over a peaceful dinner. 

Though the food is good, but the layout of the restaurant is kind of unappealing. It's huge and loud and extremely noisy. 

Personally I was not happy visiting the place. 

Service is good on the contrary and the way they serve drinks is very stylish.

This is my recent favorite in full dining restaurants. The restaurant is located next to TFO and Shisha on the 5th Floor of the WestSide building in Camac Street. The staff is courteous and the ambiance is themed on the black and white times of 1960s. There are black and white tiles on the tables and food is served keeping the theme in mind. If you visit, must have the Papad Kebab along with the seasoned onion they serve with it. Also try their Amritsari Pindi Chana and Amritsari Kulcha, their portions are generous and 1 dish is sufficient for 2. Prices are reasonable considering their location and genre. Must visit for all foodies.

Edit- Visited them for their Grand Trunk Buffet. The buffet is themed to cover areas through which the ancient Grand Trunk Road passes. This week's theme was BENGAL! These guys did a fabulous job with the buffet and had pretty much everything to offer. Their standard buffet structure was followed for items and covered Chicken, Fish and Mutton for non-veg (No Prawns though). Main course had Mutton Kosha but the mutton could have been cooked better. The dessert options could be worked on and surprisingly, there was no Mishti Doi or Rosogulla for their Bengali dessert options.

We visited this place for a family dinner . Our first order was broccoli soup which was served to us in an unwashed hat , full of dust which was later changed . The starters were average , with same onion pickled salad and chutney . The main course started with a disappointment , with stale smelly chana being served to us . It was obvious that we were being served old stale food . Apart from these experiences , the black dal was scrumptious , mix veg and Kashmiri alu dum was great . The breads were really thin compared to other places , and we had to repeat the order to fill in the belly . Rasmalai Tiramisu for dessert was quite good . Hope the short comings are looked into for the betterment .

It was really a brilliant experience.
1)Ambience-4.5/5
Great ambiance with  calm atmosphere with soothing music. The whole restaurant cum bar has a vintage look .
2)staff-5/5
Staffs are very helpful and cordial .Whatever you want they will be just there without your call. All of them are very minutely watching your requirements .They serve so many things like to your table just to help in buffet too . Infact if needed they can also help you to bring food from corners.
3)Food-5/5
Now coming to the main point the food .THIS IS THERE BEST PART. I tried there buffet menu so will describe it. They only have a buffet manu for all and probably there is a special offer on Bengali @new year (though it's my guess ,I didn't asked )
First they serves complimentary drink (soft) which has 2/3 options .
Next when You lift a plate there are salads of 6 types from veg to nonveg and all are equally tasty.(I added allmost full course menu pics).Additionally there was raita too.
Then there was soup of two types one is veg and another nonveg and again u can try both :)
In the mean time they served a veg chat in our table. Next they served three different plates of chicken cebab , fish chop and veg chop .From this three chicken was best so I took one more plate :).
Next we moved to main course .There are 
Rice ops polau -It was ok
But they asked if with this rice we want to take radhaballavi /Nun /Culcha though we didn't.
In main course next all the items were great and which makes me astonished is there spread of items of veg and nonveg.All were great.Not to make it lengthy I will just mention the name with rice
There was dal, posts Bora ,jhinga ALU posto, til kumro,palong chanar kopta, chanar dalna, begun pora bhorta .All are veg dishes and all are really good. Next  was fish shorshe ,Chicken korma,Mutton korma .It will certainly create a regret why don't we have double stomach!But yes main course ends here .
Then there was desert section .Desert section started with hot gulabjamun of two types .Then another two type of sandesh .Trust me they are so yummy u will never stop to eat .Lastly two types of ice - creams with various topping options .Again last but not the least ended with fresh fruits with fresh cream.
All these costs ₹ 700 including all taxes and service charges without alcohol.
That's allll.

Tried their Grand Trunk road buffet which is their Poila baisakh special buffet which had Bengali cuisine. To start with, the ambience is really amazing, staffs are very well behaved. Food quality was very good specially the fish quality was really good. They had chicken, fish, mutton in their buffet spread. The buffet spread had a lot of variety. It was worth the money. Would love to visit again. Keep up the good work Team.

Enjoy a Plethora of Subcontinental Cuisines @ We.Desi, Kolkata ☺

Event: The Grand Trunk Road Buffet

Commence Date: 1 March 2017

Duration: 22 Weeks

Time: 12 noon - 3 pm

Spanning between four neighboring countries of the Indian subcontinent, namely - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, The Grand Trunk Road (G.T. Road), one of Asia's oldest and longest major roads, covers a formidable distance of 2,500 km, travelling the culture rich establishments of cities like - Kabul, Peshawar, Lahore, Amritsar, Delhi, Agra, Chittagong etc. 

How nice it would be to get a whiff of different authentic cuisines, that are prevelant in these cities? How doubly nice it would be to get it all at a reasonable price without going through the bother of travel and packing?

We.Desi has made it all possible via their well thought of The Grand Trunk Road Buffet food festival, wherein one by one, they will be holding lunch buffet of different regional cuisines that fall on the path of the G.T. Road.

They kick-started this amazing festival with the "Pashtun Cuisine" i.e. the cuisine of the Pashtuns, who  primarily inhabit the regions of eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan.

We.Desi organized a Bloggers Meet to promote their aforesaid food festival, wherein I was thrilled to see more veg than non veg options in the buffet spread (Pashtun Cuisine), whose vegetarian section comprised of - 1 Soup Of The Day, 4 Salads, 3 Live Starters, 1 Chaat Of The Day, 5 Sabjis, 1 Dal, 2 Rice, 1 Raita, any choice of Roti and 6 Desserts.

I opted to taste the following items -

- Soup Of The Day -

Lauki Shorba: "Shorba is derived from the Arabic word 'Shurbah', meaning soup." It was a nice soup with subtle ash gourd taste. I mixed in some fried noodles from my co-diner's plate, for a better crunchy taste. 

The shorba tasted nice

- Salad -

Sprout Salad and Chatpata Macaroni Salad: Mostly comprising of very well sprouted moth beans, the former salad was a nutritious dish with balanced seasonings. While the latter oneq was basically boiled macaroni shrouded with sweet and tangy sauce.

Both the salads complimented each other and tasted nice.

- Live Starter -

Aloo Peshswari, Sarson Paneer Tikka and Malai Khumb: All the three tandoor grilled starters were prepared live and served on our table. Their core ingredients were of good quality and their taste was enhanced with rich creamy marinations. They came accompanied with green chutney.

All the three starters tasted very nice.

Papad Kebab: This was one of their signature kebabs, which was not a part of the laid out buffet, but the hostess was kind enough to order a plate for our table.

Herein, the usual potato-cottage cheese tikki was richly coated with tiny pieces of papad. It's actually not easy to retain so many pieces while cooking the kebabs. But they did it beautifully, maintaining the outer coating's crunch and inner tikki's taste.

These kebabs tasted excellent. I have had the chance to taste similar kebabs, a couple of times earlier, but the ones served here simply outdid the others.

- Chaat Of The Day -

Dahi Papdi Chaat: May what the cuisine is on offer, an average Indian is always ready to consume some relishing chaat on the side.

A lovely plate of Dahi Papdi Chaat, complete with papdis, curd, tamarind and green chutney, spicy potato and sprouts mixture etc., well garnished with coriander leaves, pomegranate seeds, beetroot juliennes and sev was served.

It looked beautiful and was just perfect in composition. The curd was not sour and the chutneys had the right density and seasonings. It tasted excellent.

- Mains -

Paneer Butter Masala, Mawa Malai Kofte, Mili Juli Sabz Bahar and Vegetable Shabnam Curry: Within themselves, the four sabjis encompassed - potato, cottage cheese, mushroom, leafy and seasonal vegetables, thereby giving the diners a free hand to choose their preference to pair with their rice and/or breads. 

All of them tasted nice.

Sabut Urad Makhan Malai: Made of whole urad beans, this dal was devoid of an excess of khara masalas and other spices.

Resultantly, it paired very well with steamed rice.

Jaituni and Jattar Naan: Two baskets of freshly prepared Jaituni and Jattar naans were served on the table. Jaituni Naans were garnished with finely minced green and black olives and Jattar Naans were garnished with white sesame seeds.

The naans tasted fresh and good. But the jaitun and jattar garnishings did not bring about any enhancement in the usual taste.

Steamed Rice: They were the usual steamed rice of Basmati variety. They tasted nice.

- Dessert -

Kesari Sabudana Kheer: Served in flat clay bowls, this saffron flavored sabudana and milk pudding, garnished with chopped pistachios and saffron strands, tasted quite therapeutic after tasting a variety of edibles rich in assorted masalas and butter or oil.

It was gooey, aromatic and filling. The sabudanas were well cooked. The whole dessert was kind of melt in the mouth.

- Condiments -

They basically comprised of the usual - onion ringlets, green chillies, lime, pickles, chutneys and papad. All tasted fine.

Price: Rs. 545/- plus taxes on weekdays, Rs. 645/- plus taxes on weekends

Ongoing Cuisine: Bengali Cuisine, from 8 - 16 Apr 2017

A great place with an old school desi feeling. It is situated above Westside on Camac  Street. The decor is nice and soothing with a soft ambiance and well spaced out table setting to give privacy of conversation. The service is good with courteous servers. Now to the food. We had Non-Veg buffet which had a moderate sized offerings. The starters were fair enough though a little less in quantity served with the Phuchka being a nice surprise. The main course though was delicious with a good spread and the dessert was heart warming. The food was tasty and quality. Will definitely go back again.

Superb Food  & Service

I dined at We.Desi recently and it was an amazing experience.. This place has an excellent vibe to it as it has been tastefully done and the food is just awesome.. The lunch buffet was worth the money and was very well spread. All the Live Starters were just too good and not to forget that the desserts were   the best I've tasted in any multi cuisine restaurant in and around cal. We ordered a whiskey sour too, which was ultimate (just the right blend). Also the attitude of their service staff was very humble, making all of us want to dine again at we.desi !!

We visited this place just a little while ago. When it was known as Ivory, we were regulars at this place but when the quality started to drop, we stopped going there. Now, they have reinvented themselves and have started to call themselves We Desi. 

The theme of this place had a very old school and nostalgic feel to it. They even have a cart dedicated to make live chaats for service. The starters and the soup that we had ordered were very good. A special mention to the Palak Patta Chaat and the Tomato Shorba.The main course was good but nothing was particularly spectacular. It was average or slightly above it.

Overall, its a good place to visit once in a while, but I don't think that we will be regularly frequenting the place.

Okay, so this was suggested by a friend and I entered with a lot of skepticism. We were the only customers at 8.30 PM on a Saturday night which was weird but by the time our starters came, people started to trickle in. That's the only con. 

We started off with Chicken Tikka Roll and Malai Kumbh. And I have to say that the Malai Kumbh is the best vegetarian starter I have ever had. It  delicious. So much that we ordered another. It's basically mushroom stuffing in cream, but it's brilliant. 

After starters, we went for Garlic Naan, a boneless chicken preparation(whose name I don't remember), Dal Makhani, and Malai Kofta. We went with a lot of stuff that the waiter recommended after the success with the starter, and he didn't disappoint. I have to stay this place is a gem. A tad expensive, as it came out to Rs 900 per person including a KF tower, but well worth it. Must visit.

Celebrated a sort of bachelor party with my very close cousins. Now let me tell you the special x-factor about this place- The hawk eye view of Kolkata city. Food was awesome, the had very good collection of Sparkling Wines, Cocktail & Straight Drinks. We tried Pizza and Kebabs which was very tasty. Overall i would say i was more than satisfied. The only turn off was the makeover small dance floor which didn't serve any purpose.

Was looking for a new place that offers buffet lunch. Had tried many restaurants in the city. This venue was a welcome discovery with a good assortment of veg and non-veg dishes. Presentation was noteworthy, ambience too. Overall, did quench our hunger for a decent buffet. With time to come, hope to see a revamp in the menu and a variety on offer.

Fantastic Restaurant. Total Value for money.Nice sitting.Top Class ambiance. Very Good Quantity they give. Total Paisa Vasool .You cannot ask more. Service is top Class. I want to mention something very special ,I always like Naan which is crisp and thin,I ask for it everywhere.Very rarely I get what i am actually wanting .Though everybody tries it but still i am not 100% satisfied. This was only place where i got the butter naan as i wanted it.Crisp,thin and you could eat it even after it became little cold.Everybody should visit. I shall again visit the place in near future.

We.Desi is not just another stereotyped restaurant popping out of nowhere to cash in on the on-going trend. We.Desi(or videshi...thought provoking!) takes you down the decades to the British Era and its simply astonishing. It's incredible how small details or additions bring the theme to life without trying too hard or pushing the idea into one's head. The surrounding feels admirably organic and sinks in perfectly with the unique theme.
The food is very delicious indeed. We had-
Paneer Tikka- Perfectly cooked with the burnt edges. Served with Mustard sauce which a brings out a different flavour altogether.

Pindi Chana- Comes in ample quantity and pretty good to taste.

Dal Makhni- Thick and Creamy. A must try!

To sum it up, We.Desi is worth every penny you spend given the kind of warm hospitality they welcome you with and the constant attention of every staff member to make sure everything goes by smoothly. Looking forward to try their buffet!

I visited this place on a Saturday evening with my family to spend some comfy time with my people.i reside in bangalore,so I was not aware of the recent food joints that have emerged in calcutta.i went to this place completely trusting on zomato reviews.I was supposed to go to THE FACTORY OUTLET,but due to the too young pub crowd Iver there we were directed to this restro.To be very frank I was extremely disappointed with the ambience when I entered there.we were the only people at the restro on a saturday night,which can accomated 60 to 70 people :O
I was pretty sure,that I have made a wrong selection,until I went into the mood of gulping some stuffs.n now was the complete turnaround.Such delecious  food they have with superawesome presentation.Indian preparations presented in an international way.the taste can just be termed as LAJAWAB.The mushroom starter and the parda biriyani stole the show with a perfect ending with baked gulabjamun.
The people over there were extremely courteous and the service was very prompt.
Overall for people who are food lovers can visit this place and satisfy your tongue.
I'm deducting the 1 mark only for ambience which needs quite a bit of improvement.

Looking to go out for a quite dinner with great conversations and well plated dishes and amusingly decorated drinks -  we desi it is. 

At first,  getting accustomed to the menu may take time,  took for me because.  A lot of variations and combinations let's you wonders what you actually want to try. 

The staff is a tad bit over helpful,  but that nice when u r confused.  We ordered Dahi ke takiye(was ok)  but the mutton seekh was good. 

The drinks,  as in the pics where well decorated. Tasted a bit too sweet but. 

Like the place for its presentation,  good hospitality and decor. Food is ok.  One can visit this place, if one wants to check out some fusion and be surprised.

This restaurant is where Ivory used to be. The place is huge! Checkered tables, wrought iron tables, pretty lights, a brilliant fan masterpiece sum up the decoration of the place! Done up in shades of black and white mostly, they have a chat counter. We opted for a set meal of papri chat. Followed by butter chicken gravy, dal makhni, hari mirch paratha, pudina paratha and veg pulao! We ended our lunch with baked gulab jamun with orange sorbet! 
The presentations are spot on!! The dessert was placed in a sizzler plate, the sorbet is not too sweet. The orange zest adds the tangy taste. Gulab jamun layers were added with bread slices to showcase of pile up topped with the sorbet. Excellent!

The Chicken Nizami Tangdi was a delight – the chef, as I had previously noted, loved his cheese and cream, and this was coated with a good deal of cream on top which added a layer of softness to the crisp, charred chicken underneath, the smoky saltiness offset rather perfectly. I didn’t want to add anything to this dish – not the lemon, not the chutney, and definitely not the onion – this was one dish which I had on its own, inhaling the first bite before moving on to the next.

The cocktails were pathetic. There's a standard expected when the 'specials' are ordered, that too on the recommendation of the waiter. 
The quantity sucked. 
Place seemed over priced. 
Decor was okayish. 
Below average experience.

This is a beautiful place with some unique interior decorations and food presentation.
We had here chicken nizami tangdi which was absolutely lip smacking.
The Cocktail,Green Apple Mojito,came in a skull which was pretty cool and was very refreshing.
The staffs are friendly and the nice music will surely add more goodness to the mood.
I,personally did not find the maincourse items much attractive but there are wide ranges of starters and chaats.

So today I visited to have their GT Road Buffet for 700 bucks on a weekday.We really had much expectations from this place.The starter and maincourse lived upto the expectation but the desserts are totally disappointing.

•Starter,soup and salad-The soup was lightly cooked and tasted nice.For salads there were Anda bhujia and chicken pineapple salad from non veg and veg had cold noodles salad,Corn chaat,Papdi chaat etc.I loved the salads a lot.Also,kebabs were servef on the table-Fish pakora,Chicken shammi kebab,Mutton seekh kebab,Hara bhara keba,Paneer seekh,each and every items were delicious.There was option for beer or soft drinks for complimentary drink option. 

•Main Course-The maincourse had a wide range of veg and non veg delicacies.I personally do not like veg food but the veg items here made me change my thinking-Veg food is amazing here.Also,Chicken mutton and fish items tasted great.We also got  soft kulcha parathas in mains.

•Desserts-The dessert is nothing attractive and thats really sad compared to the price of the buffet.There was kheer,gulab jamun,Chocolate pastries,Sondesh,Fruits and ice cream of two varieties.They really need to improve the dessert section.Whatever available is nice.

Service is prompt and staffs are well behaved.
Ambience is beautiful as I have already mentioned earlier.

We walked into WE.DESI on a cool and crisp winter evening . Around two hours later we emerged satiated with good food and served by courteous , knowledgeable waiters. 

Our food choice was heavily influenced by earlier reviews by Zomatians, so stuff like Bun Samosa Ghugni as starters and Nolen Gur Ka Sandook as Dessert made their way to our plates. Both rocked. 

In between came a plateful of 'Crusted Mahi Tikka' that's Bhetki Fish Kebab . I double checked with our waiter that it was indeed Bhetki and 'Not Basa' and my palate can testify that it was indeed the case. Recommended. 

For the main course, we two carnivores turned compassionate for the night and went for 'Khumb Makai Saag'. Ordered Garlic Naan as accompaniment. Best decision ever. The smoothest and yummiest Palang Saag to make its way to my tummy in a while. 

Enough has been said about the 'innovative' way food is served here , hence have nothing new to add. 

Already planning a repeat visit sometime soon, where we might try out the drinks section , which we skipped this time around. 

The indicative price of around Rs 1200 for two on this site is more or less correct . Keep in mind Service Tax and Service Charge will add around Rs 350 to that Rs 1200. 

Keep up the good work We.Desians

“The memory of having your favorite street food as a child or of the aroma of masalas at home. An amalgamation of our favourite meals from all over the country- Butter Chicken from Punjab, Mutton Vindaloo from Goa, Kashmiri Dum Aloo, Kolkata Macher Jhol is found here. Their innovative dishes include Crusted Mahi Tikka, We.Desi Paneer Cigars, Khichada and Soya Gola Kebab. Spice infused cocktails like Tandoori Narangi Martini, Tamatar and Kasundi Margarita and Beer Jhalfarezi are some of the special cocktails that bring out the distinct flavour of different states of the country. Everything from the décor to the street food concoctions beckons to those who want to be inspired and immersed in a sensational culinary experience without the fuss of formal dining”. That is the essence of We.Desi, Kolkata’s newest gastro-pub located at 22, Camac Street.

To keep it short,
Puchka Shots
Fresh Lime Soda with Masala Popcorn
Shikarkandi chaat
Corn Tart for cheese lovers
Puchka Platter with injections
Bread Pakoda for pakoda lovers
Green Apple Vodka Cocktail
Are recommended for starters!
Avoid Kebabs as they are blande, and beats the other dishes comparatively! They can be improved.
Pathani Paneer Lababdar, Daal Makhani & Corn & Palak for main course was delightful, along with Lal Mirchi Paratha!
Would love to visit again and try the revised Kebabs :)
Love and luck! 
Service was a cherry on the cake :)

Situated right next to TFO( opened in place on Ivory), it is true to its name. From the decor to the food, it is desi to the fullest. The food is great and the staff prompt. The service also super quick. 
However, the best thing about the place is the presentation and innovation. The way they serve the food is what sets them apart. Like always of the TFO, BSE and Ivory the drinks rock. In short this is a place worth visiting. 
P.S. I would love to visit the Curryaki with 10 of my friends. It is an Indianised version of Teriyaki.

If you like to eat and live in the City of Kolkata you are spoilt for choice nowadays. Lots of new place are opening up and one of them is We.Desi. I was invited as part of a Bloggers Table when they opened in September but regretfully was unable to make it due to work commitments. Thereafter they diligently kept in touch and I finally went across a couple of weeks back for dinner.

We wanted to gonto TFO but it was filled so we opted for We.desi. Initially we underestimated the place as it was quite empty but the food was really good..the presentation was different and unique..the menu variety was good though they just serve Indian food but still it has options of chaats which was tasty. Bun samosa was yummy and the kerala coconut mojito was worth trying. Light music with good service. Over all nice place to visit with family and frndz.

Any bong (or those raised here) worth his illish maach will swear by the rolls in Kolkata. Put them at Times Square and they would outdo the naked cowboy; simply by reciting a baritone version of Lord Alfred Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade in exchange for a roll from Kolkata. 

The thing is, food from home is always food that does more than fill your tummy. It makes your taste buds tickle and fart your brain cells of memories that defy the friggin law of diminishing returns. Come what may, you; will do anything for a slice of home.

Our impression of We.Desi is pretty straight. This place is everything that has been the owner's experience with food while growing up on the northern neighborhoods of our country. The spaced out seating, the open floor plan, the lights and the fans. Food at We.Desi mirrors what she grew up eating and is now sharing it with the city no gimmicks. But they have gone one step further and pulled a selection of staples from across the country and put in all together under one roof.

An approximate cost of Rs. 1,200 for two, it sits well within the range of most new restaurants in and around this area. If the staples is what you are looking for We.Desi should be on your list.

I booked a table for 12 last Saturday around 6.30 pm for 8 pm time which was confirmed by a lady who picked up the phone. After about 30 minutes I got a call from the same lady who insisted that the booking timing be shifted to 9.30 pm. I was shocked in disbelief. Is it a child's play that first booking time is confirmed and then shifted to a different slot at one's own peril. Is the management to blame or the unprofessional staff ? Do they think they are doing charity by serving patrons ? Still after a passage of one week from this incident, there is no reply from the management.

Went there for lunch. Ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer & Nan Bread. It was one of the best Dal if not the best. The nans were crispy as I like it. The service was great. Great service can be attributed to low footfall during lunch. Overall a great experience. Will surely visit again for Curriyaki (Indian food served in Teppanyaki style) & many other dishes. Will suggest it to everyone.

The ambience is very different, and has a nice feel about it. Everything is in black and white and is very new and refreshing. We ordered shikanji,which was served with an ice cone and popcorn!! It was very new and never seen before kind of a shikanji..the taste was also good-a must try! We ordered butter naan-which was very soft and melt in the mouth.Amritsari pindi chana came with pieces of paneer,and was delicious. Lastly, on recommendation of a staff,we ordered nolengurer sanduk. It was really a yummy end to our dinner! It was chocolate sponge cake with nolengurer filling!! A must-try..Overall good experience,with tasty food..:)

It broke my heart when ivory shut down its doors, it was one of my favourite places, the a la carte was amazing and so was the Buffett, so when we desi took place, we visited there as soon as possible. 

We ate a myriad of dishes such as the chicken roll, the khichdi and some more starters as well as the gur dessert. 

The starters were pretty good and so was the main course, nothing much to complain about. What I enjoyed was the quirky presentations and the fun menu, for instance, the chicken roll promised to be better than kusums and at the risk of being lame, I found that pretty funny. :P 

Overall a good place with decently priced cocktails, a must visit.

Had a great time at We.desi 
The one thing which really pleased me was the presentation of food. even the fresh lime soda was served with a twist of masala popcorn. The Chai seed phirni panna cotta was another pretty dish and tasted quite nice. The chicken tikka makhmali was super tasty and so was the parda chicken biryani leaning towards the Hyderabadi style. The service was very efficient and fast. The decor is also worth appreciating. :)
Basically a great restaurant for family dinners or lunch

Located in the Westside building in Camac Street where Ivory used to be,this new kid in the block is sure worth a visit.Starting from the retro theme to the presentation on food,people at we.Desi has done a pretty good job.The food was also nice an reasonably priced.And to add it all up was very friendly and cordial staff.If they continue as they have started,i think they will climb up pretty fast on the Kolkata's choice of places to dine.

Had a great experience at We.Desi, had visited with a group of friends for lunch on a weekday and surprisingly the place was quite empty. Do people not know about this place? Maybe it's more of a weekend,holidays and dinner time frequented place!! Anyway that's just conjecture on my part. When you get out of the lift on the fifth floor of the Westside block on 22 Camac Street and turn right, you can see the signage of We. Desi. There is also a old style clock as part of the decor near the doors leading inside. The decor inside is interesting and appealing. There are some quaint features like the A.H.Wheeler stall near the entrance,which doubles as the puchka and chaat counter.( Nostalgia.... remember Wheelers book stalls at railway stations). There are other interesting features too such as the fan installation. The walls have lovely portraits of royalty. There are Knick knacks all over adding to the ambience yet at the same time there is no cluttering instead there is a feeling  of space becoz of the monochromatic decor.
The food too was excellent. They served on the house a palate cleanser ( pineapple shikanji) and appetiser ( crispy karela)....lovely. Didn't know karela could taste this good!! The palak patta chaat was tasty and interestingly presented. The soup too was good. In the mains we had Kali dal, mixed vegetables and paneer butter masala....all good. For dessert we had chia firni panacotta...( fusion at its best). The kulcha, tandoori rotis and naans were served hot in@ an aluminium old style tiffin box. Great presentation and great food.
Service too was excellent with the waiters serving well and bringing the food also quickly.
Altogether an afternoon well spent with friends with good food amidst lovely ambience.

I have a soft corner for good gastro-pubs. The combination of good drinks along with some finger licking food makes me happy. So when I heard about We.Desi, the new gastro-pub that opened last month, I was really eager to try it out. On top of the Westside store at 22 Camac Street, this is where Ivory Kitchen used to be. The decor was bright with some fun wall installations, like a huge fan and Madhusala written beside the bar.

One of the best dining experiences we have had where indian food is concerned. Definitely the best in the city. The chai combos were brilliant- we had the bun sumosa and kulchini. The mixed daal chaat was unique and robust with flavors. We were pretty full after all this , but still decided to have mutton khichada as suggested by the lady on the floor. It was amazing. Will definitely go again with friends and family. Plus the prices are super economical, 1000 rs for 2 people is more than enough.

An unpleasantry service which ruined my mom's bday. We were asked to divide the soups ourslf by giving us empty bowls and even self serve our staters which is very uncommon in a restaurnt of this class. After payment of the bill the staff returned 1000rupee note asking us to chnge it and on reaching home we realised that it was fake..confronting the restaurnt staff regrding this matter was of little help as they were rude and denied the ownership of such note straightaway..even though the food tasted delicious the service made our experience a pathetic one..wedesi a shame to the city of joy

Had been there last Sunday with my wife and a couple of my friends. Tried a lot of starters and liked the Palak patta chat very much and the paneer roll was a must try but the rest of the items were below expectation . The presentation of fresh lime soda was very good but drink was average. In main course,  we just ordered black dal and Indian breads which was again average

Pre-Inauguration Food Bloggers Meet-up at We Desi..!

There is a new kid in town, displaying an whole array of Desi swag, Desi Food and Desi Ambiance. Located on the top floor of West Side at Camac Street, this happens to be the reincarnated version of the very famed Ivory, which in turn was formerly known as Grain of Salt. Be it from the big round fan, to the hurricanes, desi quotes, desi electrical switches one can find in the day to day house, among the many other things which I couldn’t mention, these are the major ones which struck my attention.
            

The tables are well spread, and offers you much room and space to yourself and your family. The food, especially the starters are surprisingly good. A special mention goes to the Murg Malai Kebab. The drinks again, deserves a place for the sheer innovativeness, design and presentation.
 The man behind the bar counter is undoubtedly the best I have seen, when it comes to creative thinkings, and I am sure a lot of thought and pre-planning has gone onto this before the official launch of this restaurant.
                                          ...

Another new place in the city.. although redone and serving indian itself.. the tea and chat menu seemed interesting but unfortunately couldn't try since I went for dinner.. I had ordered some mix vegetable from live counter along with daal,biryani,breads and one no onion garlic kofta for one individual who doesn't eat onion. Now the kofta, daal and biryani came along with the bread but the main vegetable did not,waiting ....waiting I started eating and landed up finishing my entire meal along with cocktails and still no sign of my vegetable. At my last round (seconds)of biryani he rushed the vegetable to me which was undercooked because of some mishap of my order going to someone else's table. Now this happening at rush hour is still okay but not when only 4 tables are running. They cancelled that order thou. Kaali Daal was superb (must have) and biryani was flavoursome. But I hated having to eat my meal with just daal ;We Indians love variety! 
Place is done up neatly but avoid sitting in the booths coz the air conditioning is bad almost nil on that side.Will go try the tea menu soon.

We. Desi, a modern Indian Comfort Food Gastro-Pub recently opened doors in Calcutta, and I was invited to a preview of the food and drinks. Located at 22, Camac street, on the 5th floor, We. Desi is next to some of Calcutta’s popular restaurants. The first thing you notice when you enter the place is the size. This place is HUGE. Spread across three thousand feet, it seats about one hundred people.

Location-Camac street,Westside building,5th floor.

This place is located where Ivory use to be.As the name suggest We.Desi is a place where you will find totally desi food presented in a firangi way.This place is decorated totally in a black and white theme and is very well known for its food presentation.Its a very huge place and can accomodate around 60-70 people at a time.As you arrive at this place you will feel the retro style of this place with antique clocks,lanterns,telephone and many more objects around it.

Service-The service at this place is very fast and reliable.The staff is extremely friendly and cooperative.They guide you very well in choosing the right dish and in right quantity.You will always find their staff serving with a smile which is very positive.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The place is very well decorated and utilized to its full extent.Its a sober place to spent quality time with your family or to hang out with your friends.

Food-Our main moto to have a visit at this place was to see their food presentation and they were impeccable at it.The way they present their food will enforce you to order more from their set menu.Along with the presentation the taste of the food they serve was also good.We had-
1:Nolen gur ka sandook.
2:Bun samosa ghugni.
3:Keralla coconut mojito.
4:Masala mojito cola float.
They all were good in taste but a must try is their "Bun samosa ghuhni" and "Nolen gur Sandook".

Service-5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-4.5/5

This place has got the best services in comparison to any other places we have visited till date and their food presentation is by far the best we have seen.😃😃

This restaurant was recently opened on 22, camac street and I so wanted to go there since then. We tried couple of cocktails and mocktails which was made very well. We tried paneer tikka kebab, chicken Malawi kebab and puchka. All of them was good and upto mark. Mix vegetable in the main course was quite disappointing as it was not cooked properly. Serve was nice and ambiance was good. Overall a good experience..!!!

Looking forward to spend a quality time with friends or family over good food and cocktails we. Desi is the place.
As a first time visitor to we Desi on a friend's birthday the experience was really good. Here's why you should go to this place-
*ambience- if you're looking for sober family dinners or to spend some fun time with friends we Desi' ambience is perfectly suited for either or them. 
*service -  amazingly cordial service coupled with cute welcome greeting of aam panna n a little snack.  Special mention to the person who was in our service Mr.  Christopher. You feel welcome with the kind of treatment to get from the staff there. 
*cocktails -  pls do go to this place for its amazing cocktails.  They have sufficiently good variety of cocktails & what adds to the feel is its creative presentation. It lives up to its theme of dinner and cocktails restro. 
*food -  it makes no compromise with its food as well.  We ordered for a veg dinner nan,  dal makhni n mix veg. Although mix veg wasn't that great but all in all the food wasn't a disappointment. 
*affordability- with such high end services you're sure get a pinch on your pocket but with my personal experience it's worth it.  If there is a budget issue we can sure not repeat our cocktails but can try once when in mood to try a good nice place. 

In short,  a good place to treat yourself with some delicious food & cocktails.

So I happened to be the first customer at We.Desi and absolutely loved the music, the ambience and the fresh vibe of the place! Calcutta definitely needed a North Indian restaurant with a modern setup. The food at We.Desi is pretty good, and the staff is very hospitable though I do believe they can be more efficient with the time they take to get the food! Special mention has to be made about the various Cocktails as well as of the Mushroom starter that I couldn't have enough of. Looking forward to another dine out at this amazing place!

I'm vegetarian and usually enjoy small portions of lot of dishes (tapas style or tasting menus) so I get to taste quite a few dishes. We were 2 of us today. I like when innovation is done with food and attempts are made to break away from the monotony of regular dishes.

Pros 
- Good warm service and friendly staff
- Not cramped up 
- Simple and minimalist design 
- Good drinks options. 

Cons 
- Food a major disappointment 
- Decor too bright ( would def feel nicer with dimmer lights) 

Ordered 
1) Palak Chat - quite ordinary as you would have eaten in anyplace before. 
2) Soya Kabab - Kababs chunks served on bed of curd. Again just fried and served. No real taste
3) Tart with peas - This was the only dish which was passable. 
4) Baigan Bharta - I asked them specifically if it's smoked well and would taste like what you get in Dhabas. They waiter confirmed yes it would but the taste didn't seem to suggest so at all. Also, was made so spicy that we could barely eat. 

Overall I feel this place is a little lost as to where it's trying to place itself. Can be a fine after work hours drinks and nibble place or a casual dinner place. 

With innovative options coming around its time the chef put the thinking caps on and come up with some interesting options.

With the current food options would not go back!

I went there last week and absolutely loved it! Newly opened, it is quickly becoming one of the major hot spots of Kolkata. Their unique cocktails and modern Indian food along with unique presentation was completely worth it! Moreover, we had lots of fun trying out their different Indian-fusion and uniquely-named drinks. Some of our favorites were Narangi Adraki Old Fashioned and Kerala Copi Mojito. 
Aptly named, We Desi serves some of the most delicious Indian food in the city. From Bun Samosa Ghugni, Talwari Murg Malai Kebab and Punjabi Kadhi Pakora to Amritsari Kulcha and Nolan Gur Ka Sandook, everything was super delicious. This combined with an amazing staff and comfortable ambience, We Desi is the perfect place to go for a fun and delicious night out with friends and family. 
Also, if you want to avoid the wait, do reserve a table before visiting.

The tandoori jhinga was so so so good along with the baked gulab jamun I could eat for all 3 meals a day. 

But as always the drinks take the spot light. The potent concoctions along with the presentation and just the right company may just be the answer to all your life problems

All in all, had a great time and am already looking forward to my next visit there.

For an ultimate zen experience for the discerning palate, this is the place.  
Food: The chai combos will remind everyone of the street food they grew up on. Lives up to the thier promise of nostalgia. My personal favorite is the Kulchini.  The mains are scrumptious and deliver authenticity that i have not found in any Kolkata restaurant before.
Ambience: Nostalgia. Old fans, gramophones, black and white vintage prints take you back in time.
Service: For a new restaurant that is packed during lunch and dinner, they still manage beautifully.
Overall, a fantastic experience. Would be going back as soon as I can.

Our roots define us, and deep in our mind we all are proud to say “WE.DESI”. The name in itself gives us a journey to the desi flavours away from the firangi touch we all are living in. Kolkata has always been house to beautiful rich flavours tossed up in style and fashion. This time, everyone’s favourite 22 Camac Street hosts this one of a kind gastro pub just in everyone’s vicinity. “WE.DESI”, which opened its doors on the 1st of September 2016 is all set to make a promising impact on the food lovers of Kolkata.

Main course was good too. Dessert counter needs some innovations. 
Couldn't try the tepenyaki counter an attractive innovation to Indian cuisine. 
Must try the kadhi, chicken talwar and mutton foot long.

I had gone on a Saturday evening for a family dinner and somehow loved it absolutely. They started with a complimentary dish which had pineapple shikanji with a salad which was quite a good start. We then ordered for chaat items and they were so delicious. The presentation to each dish was very different and really good. The fresh lime soda which I ordered was superb in a skull glass(picture given). Really refreshing. 
We then ordered for the main course (Indian) and stuffed mushrooms. Everything tasted epic. The mushrooms was given in a iron platter with a burnt coal beneath. It was hot , tasted delicious. Although very heavy. 
All in all it was a good choice for good food and lively ambience. Highly recommended with prior reservation.
