THEY ARE NOT PROVIDING HOME DELIVERY YET THEY HAVE STATED THE SAME. IF THIS IS NOT A MALPRACTICE THEN WHAT IS? FURTHER YOU NEED TO CONTACT THEM WAY IN ADVANCE FOR ORDERS AS IF THIS IS SOME SORT RAILWAY RESERVATION BOOKINGS.

HAVEN'T TASTED MUCH BUT THEIR PARANTHAS/LUCHI WITH ALOO DUM/ALOO TARKARI IS THE BEST AMONG THE LOT, DOES REMINDS ME OF A TRUE HOME-MADE TASTE.
