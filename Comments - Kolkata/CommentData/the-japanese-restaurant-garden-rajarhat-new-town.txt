Visited this place a few days after Christmas 2017. Set inside the Eco-Park,Rajarhat this place was jam packed with crowd roaming,eating and spoiling the grounds-which unfortunately is the usual psyche of us Indians!

However, the Japanese garden was spared from such horror thanks to an Entry fee of Rs.30 per head. The garden itself is serene and well maintained with the beautiful Japanese architectural structures here and their.

Now coming to the restaurant, the outside seating area is well made and spacious-a perfect place to enjoy the winter sun. The area inside the restaurant is small but cozy.

We were 4 people in a group and ordered -

1.Chicken Teriyaki Maki

2.Brinjal Tempura

3.Paneer Khushiage

4.Shyoga Fried Rice

5.Chicken Teriyaki

6.Chocolate milk shake

Firstly the portion size is less compared tot he price.

Secondly, paneer,  milk shakes, chinese preparations a part of Japanese cuisine?!!! What on earth were you thinking?

Thirdly, the Chicken Teriyaki sushi was horrible,cold and had a petrified smell so much so that I couldn't even chew it properly but had to spit out. Terribly YUCK!!! Even rest of the dishes were served cold and seemed unfresh to say the least.

The only saving grace was the rice and the teriyaki chicken gravy. To top it, the server Debabrata Mandal kept on arguing continuously that we, the customers are unaware of Japanese food taste. He refused to take the constructive criticism about the Sushi. Really uncourteous and horrible staff.

You ask for refill of water and they serve you when it's about time to leave the restaurant.

One of the staff member came to serve sans any smile on his face, uncourteous and looked half dead and half sleepy.

I mean with such a boom in the hospitality sector off late in Kolkata, this is how your restaurant's attitude is towards the customers?!! Really appalling. 

I would never ever go back to this restaurant, not even for a cup of beverage. the experience has left a bad taste.

The management needs to take a note of this and improve their services or else it may cater to the suburban mass but not to rest of the clientele.

It was such a nice ambience that made me feel like that i am not in kolkata..  Totally different experience..  We prefered the outside tables.  Waiters are well behaved.  Service was good but little slow.  But the time we enjoyed by roaming around. Had fried rice and chilli chicken as i was not in mood of having sushi or tempura.  The food was mouthwatering and gst in inclusive.  Will visit again

I have visited there during this Christmas. The location of the restaurant is inside the Eco Park and near the gate no 1. You have to buy another 30 Rs/head ticket to enter into the Japanese garden. The  restaurant has both inside and outside seating arrangement and in winter you will really enjoy sitting outside. The inside sitting area is small compared to the outside and there's nothing fancy in the inside decor. 
   Coming to the food we have tried pina colada and chocolate milk shake. Both were pretty good and I liked the milkshake more. Also tried chicken gyoza and noodles. The taste of the gyoza was not good. I didn't really like it. And during rush hour they take a lot of time to serve the dishes. Overall I am impressed by their beautiful garden and the ambience but not really by the foods. Drinks were good though.

This was on my list for a long time, finally post Xmas we visited the place.The place is inside the Eco park in Rajarhat,we need to buy 2 tickets separately.one for the park & one for the Japanese Forest where the restaurant is situated.if we enter from the gate 2 of the Eco park as it is the most prominent gate.we need to move to our left hand side, for  land mark you can always follow the path to the Eiffel tower.coming to the Restaurant (it is a part of Fuji franchise)  it provides Three kind of seating area.Fistly you have the interior where it is very scanty place we have 4 tables one big Sofa, secoly just outside of the restaurant there are Seat for two people, thirdly we have the seat in the garden area made out of granite which brings a different feel to it altogether.We went for the 2nd option.For ambience they get a 4 out of 5.as the interior was minimal but the outside seats are really nice to enjoy both food & the surrounding, they could use some insect zapper to solve the problem of mosquito & houseflies.Coming to the Food now we had quite a few dishes in mind for trying.For starter we started with Chicken Teriyaki maki sushi, chicken khushiage & prawn tempura.The sushi was perfect one bite size, however the chicken inside was fried & tasting bit fishy still it was a nice tasty dish,the khushiage was bit dry from inside over it was a chilli mayo, the sauce served with it was bit tangy. The prawn tempura was crispy outside & the prawn was still succulent.so it was the best in the lot.To gobble all this we had some drinks mango juice & kiwi soda.both were cooling.Next for main course we ordered Mix yaki Soba noodles & for side dish we had Chicken Teriyaki.The Quantity for yaki Soba noodles was quite enough for two.The Teriyaki chicken was bit sweet if you want it spicy need to state to the server in first only.For dessert we had their ice-cream one was green tea flavoured another was coconut flavoured,both are a must try.Only one problem was all foods had very bland on the salts.So a 4 out of 5.The service was quite good the waiters were very polite & helpful.the service was prompt with the time needed to make the dishes.so another 4 out of 5.over all a nice experience.so you can visit the place.Once or twice as it is not possible for visiting the park every time just to have a dinner or lunch.

This place is inside Japanese garden at ecopark near gate number 1. There is outdoor /indoor seating available. Indoor is not that big.
Quality of food was really good and delicious. And if you want to try sushi you can list this as an option actually.

This place had both indoor and outdoor seating . Its located inside japanese forest for which you have separately get tickets for . The indoor seating was quite small but cosy . The food we ate was good in amount and really tasted well . We ordered chicken noodles , chilli chicken , cheese sushi . All of them were really good but tbh sushi is not my thing as my friend did like it and I couldn't take it in  . It was made of cheese and sticky rice layers. Overall a good place .

I like different thing always, so I went there. And yes, taste of all food was different. The sushi had too much fishy flavour. They provided soy sauce with chicken tempura and sushi. Chicken tempura was almost no salty flavour but the  soy sauce mixed was salty flavoured. Nice restaurant 'n a nice place.¬†

Hello guys!! Dined out at a new restro(to me) for the first time. Read good reviews of this place long time back and since then had been wanting to visit it. Okay! coming to this place, we visited it for dinner. Entering the resto area(it's in the midst of japanese garden), it had an oriental setting and feel altogether. Right with the dragons sitted at the entrance and the giant Lord Buddha welcoming us, I was mesmerised. The amount fo lights was as requiresd. We chose to eat out at the outdoor sitting area. Coming to food, me and my hubby decided to go light on food(as we had already kinds stuffed ourselves with junk food). For starters it was spicy mushroom sushi maki and gyoza non veg soup. The sushi tasted good with the right filling. The soup could have been better though. For  main course, we chose shyoga fried rice and fish teriyaki. Fried rice quantity was good enough for two and the flavours soothed our taste buds. Fish Teriyaki was the best amongst all. Perfectly marinated and perfectly cooked.And we were done for tonight. All these flavoursome course for only Rs. 820. Didnt even burn a hole in our pocket. Highly recommended to all and shall visit this place too soon and try new dishes.

Really well prepared Japanese cuisine. We had Chicken maki sushi, fish maki sushi and chicken tempura for appetizers and must say the quantity is pretty good. The yaki soba noodles was also great. Best thing is the ambience of course! Amidst the Japanese Garden section of Eco Park, the setting and preparations gel too well to perfection. Hope you keep up the good standard.

Just coming out of the resturant ,simply satisfied with the food n ambience :) ... For me its quiet pocket friendly too(3 dishes cost us 770) .. We went for little snacks  order Fish teriyaki maki n fish tempura n for mocktail pinacolada .. 
Well was quiet impressed with d mocktail n sushi (liked d hint of wasabi given with it) but the fish tempura was avg ,not oily or soggy but not crispy at all ...
Ambience wise one of the best place (specially at evening ) ..The adjacent japanesse garden is really cool . 

If u are coming after 6-6.30 ,u wont have to pay the park entry fee , other wise as told by the staff they generally refund it ..

The staff are also frinedly n courteous.,they were helpful enough to send a guy near the eiffel tower as we were unable to locate the resturant .. 
My overall rating is 4 :)
Food - 4/5
Value for money - 3.5/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Staff - 4/5

Would like visit again :)

If you want to try a different ambience far away from the crowded city directly under the sky with the bell ringing around and bamboo sticks making natural music by striking against each other,  then you should try this o place at least once.  Staffs are very helpful and they will tell you about the food before they take the order. Try chicken sushi , chicken teriyaki chicken....

Strolling through the beautiful Japanese garden is purifying your mind and soothing your soul.Who could think of such a serene picturesque ambience and an open air dining amidst nature in today‚Äôs busy city of Kolkata.There is a huge statue of meditating Buddha just at the entrance.The restaurant(an outlet of Fuji) is  named  ‚ÄúShitoko‚Äù.
As you walk through the coiling trail of bamboo chimes made of original full grown bamboos you will set free your mind and will feel calm and serene.The  traditional moon gate takes you to the realm of nature in its full bloom.The miniature sculptures of the Seven deities of seven aspects of life, the Saints.the demon saint and their stories written briefly in stone inscriptions transport you to the world of folklores and mythology. The white flags with Japanese scriptures in black swaying in the afternoon breeze fan away all the worries and anxieties as you gently walk on passing through the gate made of a number of red pillars, the Tori gate,the wishing Pond and  stroll over the zigzag pathway and the cute red Japanese bridge over a pond.The trail is flanked by innumerable unknown plants,shrubs and bushes with pretty flowers and bamboo thickets .while  the chirping of thousands of birds tunes your mind away from the chores of city life,a periodic gong from the  pagoda transcends you to another world.
Coming back to the porch of the restaurant now it is time to look at the menu.Apart from well known Japanese delicacies like shushi,Yakitori and Tempura they also serve Khushiage( bread crumbed skewers), Kaarage ( steamed momos) Gyozas(soup) for appetisers. For main course there are Japanese sticky rice with Japanese curry
and Yaki Soba which are basically noodles with a sauce of a bit different flavour(quite similar to XO sauce).There are prawn as well fish options in non veg along with chicken.we tried  ChickenTeriyaki Maki (sushi)and Mixed yakisoba.Both were excellent.The sushis were perfect for our Indian pallets...well done with an authentic balance of flavours.The noodles were loaded with lots of prawn and chicken and the taste was lip smacking.The quantity was also more than sufficient.The service was prompt and the staffs were helpful and courteous.We left the place being rejuvenated and reenergised to handle the busy chores of life until we get another lazy day to come back  here.

If you want go out for a dinner nearby Rajarhat then its a very good place for romatic date.

Located at the Action Area 2 near gate 1 before the Eifel Tower.

You need to buy a ticket to enter the garden or the restaurant. I think restaurant owner should take the ticket price on thier shoulder for restaurant customers.

Inner dinnig section is small and cozy but interior is very good. Outside ambiance is just fantastic in evening time. 

Service is very courteous and good.

We took Mango Polar, and Green Eyed Monster as a drink. Both were good.

From tge starters we had Fish tempura. It was very good. No oil at all.

From Main courser we had Mixed Waki Soba Noodles (the best hakka noodles I had in recent times), Fish schezwan Fish (very good) and mixed Fried rice.

I just loved the entire menu. Will go again and again.

The Japanese Restaurant, an outlet of Fuji, is situated inside the Japanese Forest at Eco Park, serving delicious Japanese food like sushi and tempura and other lovely culinary items. It's only a few minutes' walk towards the lake from Gate No 1 and easy to locate to the left as one enters the huge park.

The picturesque Japanese forest/garden is beautifully decorated with a sitting Budhha statue, lion sculptures near the entrance, a tall pagoda, traditional Japanese toro lamps, torii gates (traditional Japanese gates found in Shinto shrines), flowers, trellises, zigzag bridge, miniature Budhhist monk and saint statuettes, a grotto, pretty fountains, pillars with Japanese inscriptions, a lovely red Japanese bridge over a pond etc. that make it a great spot for photoshoots, selfies or group pictures. üèØüéãüééüéèüéê

The restautant's open-air seating area is quite cozy and perfect for some enjoyable conversation over delicious Japanese or Chinese delicacies. One can also sit indoors, inside the Japanese-style restaurant. 
As evening approaches, the entire garden is lit and comes alive with a fairy tale-like beauty of its own, like the bamboo installation in a corner of the alfresco patio.

We gorged on the Chicken Yakitori and Chicken Karaage. One can also go for the Teriyaki Maki Sushi or Khusiage. üç±üçòüçôüçöüçõüç≤üçúüçù
The Yakitori were slightly sweet and sticky skewered chicken, good in taste, while the Karaage were deep-fried crispy chicken balls served hot and delicious.
However they take some time to prepare the fresh food as orderd.

A thing to note was the mosquito repallent coil that the attendant brought us to save us from harmful mosquito bites, a gesture well appreciated. Their behaviour was also courteous and polite. üëç

Those fond of Japanese cuisine can surely try out The Japanese Restaurant just for a change and to add to one's experience of following the Japanese food trail, if one has already tasted from other well-known Japanese eateries in the city. ‚ò∫

The problem with most restaurants is that if it has a good ambience, it stops concentrating on the quality of the food. It's not the same here. The Japanese Restaurant and Garden is a place that offers it all - incredible food in a charming restaurant, set with a piece of Japanese-themed garden. Eco Park is a huge place; and the "Japanese Forest" is a section where you can spend an entire afternoon or evening, if not the entire night. It has a beautiful temple, a wind-chime made of full-sized bamboos, ad so much more! And, once you're done, sit down at the restaurant to enjoy some authentic Japanese delicacies, like soba noodles, tempura fries, sushi, and so much more! While the inside seating is cozy, I personally prefer the outdoors, under the open sky, or in the balcony area of the restaurant. The food is absolutely amazing here. The restaurant is actually an outlet of Fuji, one of the best Japanese resturants in the city, with the original outlet located in Sarat Bose Road. And, the Eco Park outlet offers the the same quality. I would suggest you stick to the Japanse menu, even though there are Chinese options, too. Altogether, it is a complete experience to visit this place and dine there.

The restaurant opened right on time. Kolkata winter is quite romantic, and this garden is your perfect date option. It also satiates your love for Japanese cuisine. So, located inside Eco Park is this forest and restaurant. You have a parking space. There is a entry to the forest. They house a pagoda, a pretty bridge, garden, walk ways and the restaurant. You can spend hours here. Ample greenery around, don't miss the sun setting against an Eiffel Tower backdrop (yes, thay have that too!).

I was invited here for a food preview and was quite happy with the quality and quantity! The sushi platter was just as my liking - tempura prawns inside made a mouthful! Okonomiyaki was top class - almost made me miss my days in Japan!
Yaki Soba was so heavy in quantity but good in taste. Missed out on the green tea ice-cream! The mocktails are innovative and loved the green apple one. Highly recommended!

Being a Japanophile, my weeabo instincts got triggered as soon as I came to know about the Japanese Garden in Eco Park. Hadn't it been for this place, this Fuji would have stayed unknown to me. Well matching cuisine to get the entire vibe is saikou( J-term for supreme).

Since I'm not gonna talk about my Jap love here obviously, let's cut to the chase and enter the food base.
The place wasn't particularly capacious, neither snug for the lack of patrons probably. It was however very serene and easy on eyes and mind.

About the dishes now:
The menu was tight, thereby didn't leave us with much choice. Had like 1/4th of what the Original Fuji had to offer.
InB4 I was prepared, but yeah.
Ordered two mocktails on go.
Virgin Pina Colada: Looked like lassi, oversweetened and occupied a meh position on the bar.
Italian Smooch: Scoring higher than the prev one, it had balance.
Teriyaki: When in doubt always go for chicken teriyaki. They didn't have it on menu. I asked it for it, since paying 180bucks for 3 pieces of Yakitori felt like a waste. The one they served was fine, didn't pack much of a punch like its main outlet. Lacked mashed potato as well, tfw potatoes is life.
Prawn Tempura Maki: Idk if it's me, or everything here lacks the burst. I mean I can't complain that it was bad, but couldn't let go of the feeling of something missing.
Chilli Garlic Yakisoba: Well didn't expect in the first place, so wasn't surprised when they served Udon under the veil of Yakisoba.
Man it's disheartening, why they don't study the cuisine when they exclusively opened a joint to retain it.
The taste was good, won't whine about it.

That's it I guess. Pretty sure they are taking the leverage of the location and the atmosphere that appeal to otakus and all, eh. Not recommendation worthy, you might visit or not on whims.
There are better places popping up in Kolkata, serving manifold tastier Jap cuisine.

The recent addition to Eco park is the Japanese garden , located left to gate 1 is an ideal spot for spending some time amidst the tranquility of nature , slow down and destress our busy lives over lazy loitering around the zigzag pathways , exploring the garden , the japanese monastry , the gate made of a series of red pillars and gorging on authentic japenese cuisine served by the restaurant run by Fuji . The eatery has an outdoor seating as well as a interior dining space though small but a well decorated one . The staff does their job very well. We walked in for a weekday lunch and ordered for Non veg set menu at Rs 699 which is  undoubtedly a steal deal comprising set portions of soup , sushi , tempura and rice/noodles , the entire meal comes with chicken as the only non veg variant. With extra orders of FISH TERIYAKI , GREEN TEA ICE CREAM and the meal which had CHICKEN WANTON SOUP , CHICKEN MAKI SUSHI , CHICKEN TEMPURA and CHICKEN SOBA NOODLES , my first experience on japanese cuisine couldn't been better! Each and every item was done flawlessly and worth every penny. The place in particular is unparalleled for a romantic date , the soothing ambience and a delicuous meal is enough to melt your date's heart ;-)

This small restuarant is a unique experience altogether. Apart from the decent food, one gets to enjoy a walk at the japanese garden. The restuarant has indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. The decor is pretty average. However, it was neat and clean and has an adjacent washroom. The staff was polite.

The food was tasty. We ordered fish tempura, crab sushi, prawn skewers and chicken wanton soup. The wonton soup has a bit too much pepper. Sushi was tasty and the skewers were well crumb fried. 

P.S. I was surprised when I was told that they don't served regular water when we asked for some water. We had to buy mineral water.

This restaurant is inside the Japanese Forest near Gate no. 1 of the Eco park.The Japanese forest itself is breathtaking.Can't say the same for the restaurant though.They have a limited menu.The quality of the food is not that great but acceptable given the reasonable pricing.If you are visit the forest and want someplace to catch a quick bite then it's fine.They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement.If you wish to have a beautiful view of setting sun over the lake sit outdoor but don't forget to carry mosquito repellent.

Being hidden from the normal cacophony of the city, this restaurant has not got it's deserved popularity as yet....It's located inside the Japanese Forest in the Eco Park....We visited around 5 in the evening in the month of August.....The atmosphere here is very pleasant with an effort to showcase all the Japanese Traditions in a limited space....A huge statue of Lord Budhha welcomes you to the garden....The bells chiming inside the temple,the waterbodies,the flora and fauna, everything combined sets a mood of tranquility....Coming to the restaurant, it is a pretty cosy one with arrangement for about 15-20 people to accomodate inside and also has seating arrangement outside....The staff were quiet friendly....We ordered the following:
1) Spicy Mushroom Maki (Sushi)-They had done quite justice to this famous Japanese delicacy
2) Chicken Fried Rice which was light and simple but quite tasty
3) Green Tea Ice-cream- Which deserves special mention....It's one of the best flavours of ice cream I have had....It's a must for anyone visiting this place...

The only drawback is that you have to pay ‚Çπ60 per person(‚Çπ30 at the main entrance & ‚Çπ30 again to enter the Japanese Forest) to reach this restaurant....But the yummy food makes up for it :)

1st things first. You are going here to have sushi. If you have not tried continental, don't try it. Budget is on the expensive side. But the noodle was amazing, as was the ice-cream. The ice-cream was one of a kind. Environment is awesome. Visit for an experience. It's worth it.

Had the Chicken Teriyaki Sushi, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken and Prawn Yaki Soba(Noodles), Chicken and Paneer Teriyaki. Food's good and quality is great. Each plate enough to fill the appetite of 2 people. Service is up to the mark as well. A nice lunch amidst such calmness is just what you need to ease out the stress. After the lunch, you can take a stroll in the Japanese Garden as well. And you won't regret the experience.P.S. : Won't suggest you to have the Sushi, not a very ideal dish for the Bengali taste buds.

Basically it's a small joint with about 4 tables inside the eco park. We tried the sushis there. The sushis were average. They were bigger than bite size, which makes it value for money, but slightly difficult to eat in one bite. The rice layer could have been a little thinner. My favourite was the spicy mushroom sushi. We also tried the green tea icecream. It was a little icy in my opinion, but my companies loved it. The flavour of green tea was pretty distinctive without being overpowering. So thumbs up to them. Coming to the prices, the restaurant itself is not really expensive, but having to pay entrance fees of Rs 30 per head at two different places just seems to much. So my recommendation would be to eat there if you are spending time at eco park.

An unique experience. Who would have thought of entering a restaurant by buying a ticket for rs.30 but it was worth every penny. The restaurant is located inside the japanese forest . So to eat at this little joint you have an entry fee. The garden is beautifully done keeping in mind all japanese concepts. They have the tori, the pagoda, the bells, meditation room, moon entrance and many more little things added to the dining experience. They have really maintained the place and i hope it remains this way. 

The ambience outside is serene but the restaurant is pretty small like a 15 seater. The staffs are really nice and welcoming .

Now coming to the food we ordered prawn tempura maki sushi. It had 4 sushis with prawn stuffing and it was delicious. However the wasabi was not upto mark as it was not that pungent or string.We all know what wasabis taste and feels like. This was very mild and sweet. 

Next we had the japanese mixed rice. The quantity is good for two adults. The taste was good and i loved having it with a bit of soya sauce. Just adds a bit of an extra taste. 

As a side we took the chicken teriyaki. Now to be honest i am a big sucker for sweet dishes so i never go for any sweet sauce preparation. But since i had very little option here i chose to try the teriyaki and i thought it was amazing. It had a burnt taste definitely sweet but it was different and yummy. However over eating can make you feel overdosed. Nonetheless it was good. 

We also parcelled a plate of fish khushiage. They are like chicken strips of KFC but it had fish and that too plenty of them. No complaints as it tasted yum too.

Overall i had a jolly good time . Only hope they add more sushi varieties and platters esp.salmon. Price can seem steep but the environment just over rules every aspect.

A new outlet opened for people at Kolkata inside the Eco park. This outlet in located in the Japanese garden of the park where one can move around the garden to know the Japanese culture and its various other important symbols and believes. ¬†
Talking about the restaurant it has got no more than 15 covers inside, but one can have the option to sit in the outside tables and enjoy the lush green garden. the menu is not vast but has a some specific Japanese food items, with authentic Japanese flavors. me and my friend ordered four appetizers and a bowl of egg rice. My personal love was for the veg shallow fried momo, I never had tasted such flavors before.¬†
One not so interesting thing about the menu was the dessert section, there were no choice of Japanese desserts on the menu except for the choice of two ice creams. Another thing that came to my notice was the music that was being played, did not go with the theme.
talking about the staffs, they were courteous to serve and suggest us about the dishes.¬†
I m pretty sure with time this restaurant will improve in all aspects and soon while be a new hub for Japanese delicacy. Would love to go back again.

The ambience itself sets the mood which would only add to how much one can enjoy the food. As for the quality, the food is fresh and healthy. A perfect combo of health with taste!

Food quality good. Ambience inside the rstaurant ..average..but the out garden and the sitting area is great. Variation in food choices are great. The best thing about the place is its waiters who explain how to eat Japanese food and what combination should be tried. Prices are reasonable.

Apart from the picturesque location with amazing decor, this place has a really relaxing Vibe about it. People who visit eco park usually prefer cafe ekante for it's uniqueness but Fuji has its own charm.
Good-looking food. Tastes amazing as well.
Price- a bit on the higher side of the spectrum.
Vibe- worth the money you spend.
The Japanese forest itself has beautiful gardens, pools,decorative staircases which make the visit worthwhile.

Have you ever tried dining amidst greenery? With the chirping birds taking care of the background music and fresh unpolluted air far from the hustle and bustle of the city replacing the air freshener soaked recycled packets of oxygen? Well, now you can enjoy the dining and forest bathing right here in Kolkata, which is pretty popular in Japan. This forest bathing practice generally means being in the presence of trees and it is very helpful for our overall well-being and happiness. The amount of solace that you get after couple of hours of forest bathing gives you enough fuel to get back into the rat-race for next couple of weeks or months maybe. So, this much needed eco therapy is now available at our very own Eco Park (Newtown, Kolkata) and the place I am talking about is called Japanese Garden, which also houses the Japanese restaurant, Fuji. This is the second branch of Fuji in Kolkata and in the last couple of years this name has become synonymous to finest Japanese food available in Kolkata.

Third restaurant (after cafe ekante and elements) has come up at Eco park- Fuji- the japanese restaurant inside the japanese forest @ecopark. this place offers both indoor (a.c) and outdoor sitting facility. it is near gate no 1 and there are two entry fees to reach this little gem (one at the eco park entrance,20 and the other at the japanese forest entrance,20. )

The food is delicious but what is more attractive is the japanese garden which surrounds it. the ambiance of the place is ideal for enjoying breezy evenings. you can have your choice of snacks amidst nature .the sound of the bell coming from the monastery adds serenity to this place and gives you a feeling that you are not in kolkata but out in some distant location .

The staff are cordial. we tried chicken kushiage, chicken yaki soba which is basically chicken noodles slightly different from the chinese variant ¬†(it was very spicy). the best one was the GREEN TEA ICE CREAM. it is a must try for the ones visiting here.

Fuji¬†has its brand new outlet in the beautiful¬† Japanese¬†Garden¬†at¬†Eco¬†Park. Well, a¬†Japanese¬†Garden¬†in¬†Calcutta¬†is definitely a remarkable tourist destination for all of us. And,¬†Fuji¬†is all set to welcome the visitors of the¬†Japanese¬†Garden¬†with authentic Japanese food. The¬†Japanese¬†Garden¬†is huge, well planned and presents a wonderful picturesque. There's a huge statue of¬†Buddha¬†at the entrance. The buildings are designed with similarly to Japanese style of architecture. The entire garden is full of beautiful flowers, giving enough scope for one to be lost in the beauty of this¬†Japanese¬†Garden. The restaurant is located at a short distance from the main gate. The indoor seating is limited while the outdoor seating is phenomenal and presents a beautiful view of the entire¬†Japanese¬†Garden. It's difficult to imagine that such a place is actually in¬†Calcutta¬†!

I was excited to be a part of the bloggers meet organised here. It was long since I was craving to visit both the¬†JapaneseGarden¬†as well as¬†Fuji. Inside¬†Eco¬†Park, the garden isn't very tough to locate.¬†Gate¬†1¬†will be the nearest gate to reach this place. The roof of the magnificent Japanese Temple is visible from a distance, so you can simply take a short walk from¬†Gate¬†1, following the route.

I tried few of the authentic Japanese dishes they serve, and I must say that each of them was equally amazing. I started with¬†Prawn¬†Tempura¬†Maki¬†Sushi. I'm already a fan of the sushis at their previous outlet. So, I was really eager to check if they've maintained the same consistency and taste. And yes ! The sushis tasted as brilliant as they did previously. The sushis are quite large in size, with the generous stuffing of¬†PrawnTempura. The prawn was succulent and juicy. The sushi overall was comparatively more filling, than what appeared from the portion size.

Moving on, the next appetizer was¬†Fish¬†Kushiage. This was the dish which stole the show.¬†Bhetki¬†was placed on skewers and crumb fried. The fish was fresh and extremely soft. The outer covering was super crispy and well complemented the delicate stuffing inside. It was served with a spicy Schezwan sauce which added more flavour to this starter.

The main course included¬†Tori Yakimeshi¬†and¬† Tori¬†Teriyaki.¬†Tori¬†Yakimeshi is¬†Japanese¬†Sticky¬†Rice¬† tossed with veggies, egg and chicken. The portion size is perfect for two adults. This was my first experience with sticky rice and it was amazing. The rice had a beautiful flavour and was loaded with meat.¬†Tori¬†Teriyaki¬†was¬†Chicken¬†Teriyaki, which had strips of chicken tossed in¬†Teriyaki¬†sauce and topped with sesame seeds. The chicken was well fried. The¬†Teriyaki¬†sauce went beautifully with the sticky rice. The combo of both tasted heavenly.

The dessert option was quite interesting.¬†Green¬† Tea¬†Ice¬†Cream¬†was something which sounded weird, but tasted good. The ice cream had a beautiful flavour of green tea along with crushed green tea leaves embedded within the ice cream. This is a quirky flavour, which everyone must give a try !

Overall, my experience at¬†Fuji¬†was amazing. The food here impressed me much more than it did when I had it at their previous outlet. The beautiful surroundings, the serenity of the place and the authenticity of the food create a brilliant magic, and add a charm to the overall dining experience.
