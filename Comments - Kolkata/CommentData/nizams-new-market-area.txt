I have ordered for a Mutton Chaap and Tandoori Roti. Mutton Chaap had everything but meat pieces. It was mostly bones. Ambiance too is extremely poor. However, the staff is courteous and helpful.

It's a place of historic Kathi Roll. Undoubtedly it's awesome and it will make your day.
You can also try Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. It will cost around ‚Çπ500 for two. Ambience and Decor both are poor. Place is usually crowdy.

This is indeed a legemdary restaurant in Kolkata serving rolls and kebabs. The price is low for the rolls but the stuff they offer have also become old school. Nowadays other jointa also offer great options and so I feel they should try to innovate. In all a pocket friendly place for fast food having decent taste.

Nizam's is one of those legendary outlets in kolkata that needs no introduction.Famous for kathi rolls and biryani,nizam's has maintained their legacy down the line.Located near the new market in esplanade,this place serves some of the best items in kolkata.
So one day after shopping in esplanade ,we decided to try out this authentic place.
We ordered
‚ô°Egg chicken kathi roll -The roll was huge in size and was full of chicken pieces. A must try.
‚ô°Chicken biryani-Contains one piece of aloo and 1 chicken piece. The rice was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious.
‚ô°Hyderabadi mutton biryani -Full of dry fruits,this is one of their popular item.The mutton was very well cooked and was not at all dry.
‚ô°Phirni-The best part of any meal is the dessert and this phirni is one of the best that i have ever tried.
Nizam's is a must visit place .All the items were equally appetizing.Also this place is very reasonable.

Excellent quality of foods and also the service is very good. You must try the following items here:

1. Kathi Kabab Roll.

2. Kathi Kabab (Chicken / Mutton). Try this with Paratha

3. Mutton Special Tum Tum Biryani. This comes with rice, two pieces of mutton, 6 pieces of Boti Kabab and served with cashew, raisin, dry date.

After reading so many reviews about Nizam‚Äôs rolls I had to try and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. First the paratha was itself so light, so flaky and you don‚Äôt even feel oily at all. Succulent pieces of chicken, tender and juicy is so mouthwateringly delicious. After eating you don‚Äôt feel heavy or laden with oil, it‚Äôs light and very easy on stomach. To be honest its better to try rolls only in Nizam cause other dishes are not that good in my opinion.

Um.. okay! This joint has stood the test of time.
Yeah since 1932, quite awhile, isn't it?
Well to savour our tongues & satisfy our tummies,we chose Nizam's.
This place still has that old school feel,feels nothing much has changed in the past 85 years
Which is a good thing in it's own way.
Well I only had mutton biryani,which was good but not great,bit overpriced for such a small quantity.

Nizam it is situated in the middle of the  busy market area of esplanade just beside aminia..Every kolkata folks know about this famous place-the  inventors of rolls.. but even after visiting frequently this area for the past 7 years i never ate there so for a change and for the enormous hunger in my stomach after 3 hours of shopping we entered there on a busy Saturday evening..The place was tidy and sitting area was big.. not so much decorated but it's expected from more than a century old restaurant like this which is famous for food not fancy interior..Anyway we ordered nizam special kathi kebab chicken biriyani mutton tikka masala and tandoori roti..The kathi kebab was prepared with fried onions and kali mirch(black pepper) and it tasted ok..Biriyani was light, not spicy or oily unnecessarily just the way I like it. Meat in it was tender .mutton was not chewy at all.and that soury taste that every mughlai restaurant compulsorily put into every mughlai dishes irrespective of what the dish is (be it tikka masala or chaapüòë )Nizam's don't  do that and I was able to  finish the food for that for a change this time..Thanks nizam for that‚ò∫. For dessert we had kulfi with falooda it was creamy and nice..The staffs were really well behaved.they don't show you the tantrums like other old restaurants i visited not to mention just that one beside it.service was fast,so it was nice to see happy faces even in a busy situation in there..Price was satisfactory and pocket friendly. It's common that many people have already visited this place but still who haven't and came for shopping in this area and want to give rest to their legs and tummy a delightful tour of mughlai food you need to come to the Nizam's..You won't be disappointed we're assuring you..

This is probably the most famous restaurant in Kolkata for rolls. More famous for their beef roll but unfortunately it's not available anymore. I had their CHICKEN KATHI ROLL. Without any doubt it is the best roll I ever tasted. But I think they could have provided with a bit more chicken as they are charging 50 bucks for it. I'm hoping to try out their other dishes some other day.

Took my husband out to Nizam's as he wanted to taste Kolkata's mughlai cuisine , which turned out to be utter disappointing for me. After bragging to him much about how kolkata's biryani is better than that of Delhi's , this did let me down. The food quality had deteriorated. I ordered a plate of Kathi kabab which was chewy and hard. The mutton pasanda was just chunks of mutton thrown in gravy. The chicken bharta orderd was the saviour as it was fairly good compared to the pasanda. Did not like the biryani either.

One of the iconic joints of Kolkata " Nizam's " has been serving it's followers for a long time. The front portion is now almost hidden by various banners as well as hawkers on the pavement & on the road . Visited this outlet after a considerable gap of time but was surprised to see that it's decor has remained almost the same. For those who are accustomed to the new age glitz of restaurants this place will look like shabby & sometimes even dirty & unhealthy . Tried their famous Mutton Kathi Kabab Roll which is their signature item. The paratha was crispy & the stuffing of kababs with onion & spices was very good. Have tried their biryani but it was long time ago so can't comment on it . Despite all their mughlai delicacies & the heritage tag the joint needs some renovation .

This is a very old place near new market. Frequented by busy people all the time. If you are into fancy ambience and decor then this is not your place. But if you want mouth watering mughlai dishes this is the place to be. One of the old kolkata charms. They are famous for kebabs and are said to be tge inventors of kathi rolls in kolkata. So we tried their signature mutton sheekh kebab roll and i have to say that it was extraordinary. Mutton pieces were grilled to perfection. And there was just enough amount of onion and chilli fillings. Also we had their kulfi served with faluda. Biriyani is also good. But i dod not try that recently. Have been coming here since my childhood. And will come again for more.

Went there for a small family lunch today.
So we ordered..
Chicken biryani - My favorite. Very well cooked, less oilier than what you usually get in other places
The chicken piece is so well cooked that it's just a melt in the mouth experience. Natural spices are used. Quantity is good too.
Mutton masala- A bit too oily. But taste is great, not too spicy but a lot gravy and the mutton pieces are quite soft.
Chicken tengri butter masala- Looks amazing. Milder than Mutton masala according to spice, but the taste is just ‚ù§
Naan- Just one word. SOFT.

This is one of my favourite places for mughlai food! Very cheap items with delicious flavours! Visited it twice, first time we had butter naan and chicken butter masala! Naan had been soft, filling for the two of us and the chicken had been totally delectable! The second time we went there, we had chicken tandoori (a personal favourite), another chicken item which I don't remember (it had cashew nuts in it, again quite an awesome dish) and naan! Both the times the staff helped us with seats at a comfortable corner but the service had been a bit slow! Don't think of the ambience if you come here and just gobble up the tasty food!

Went there simply in order to satiate a craving of roll. The restaurant is is congested with lots of waiters and customers. I got confused after going through the after discussing it the waiter, I chose single egg double chicken roll. It took seven minutes before they brought it. It tasted good. The waiter was very solutions towards my welfare. Good. There is a sort of informality which is present in all Muslim restaurants. Price is pocket friendly. Park your car nearby if you are lucky.

I had their MUTTON KATHI KEBAB ROLL at the Ahare Bangla food festival.

The rolls were pre-made and were microwaved on demand.

The lachcha paratha was far from flaky and crispy but a chewy,leathery mess.I could have given them the benefit of doubt on this point since the rolls were not fresh.But there's no excuse for that meagre stuffing that they had put in.The mutton was fibrous,hard and miniscule in quantity and along with the elastic paratha,it couldn't have been worse.

I hope for their sake that they serve better stuff at their original stall.But being at a food festival and dishing out food on a huge scale is no excuse for selling such bad food at such high prices.

Very disappointed!

Biriyani of Nizam is not up to the mark, mutton was not cooked properly and it was difficult to chew. The place is not clean enough. Old days of Nizam's has gone and now they are selling the older reputation only. Moreover the waiters will pass you humiliating comments if they are not satisfied with the tips you have given. So think THRICE before you step in at Nizam's.

Me and my friend Arko went to this Restaurant. 
At 5:10 PM just to have our lunch !! 
Throughout the day we were very busy !! 
So we ordered 1 chicken biryani and 1 mutton biryani.  
BIRYANI WAS AWESOME ... 
But for 1 extra potato they are charging Rs 9 . ( the price of 1kg potato is Rs 11) .
It is nice ... you can visit.

I would probably rate this resturant 4/4.5 for the food and foodie atmosphere. But just for the cooperative employees I will give 5 out of 5 to this restaurant. We had ordered Double Paratha Double Chicken Single Egg Roll. The juicy chicken im a solid paratha made the roll heavenly.

Definitely one of the best rolls that you will find in Kolkata. Although it's an age old restaurant with an old fashioned look and unimpressive interior.  But this place has to be there in a foodies list. Egg chicken roll is just superb.  Service is superfast.  I will definitely recommend it.

The Pioneers of the famous Kolkata Kathi Roll needs no introduction. Makes awesome rolls which are fab for an on-the-go munch, yet doesn't really do much wonder when it comes to Biryani or other side dishes. And their cooking medium of fat is solely Dalda/vanaspati which turns really greasy when it loses the warmth.
‚óè Located right next to the Kolkata Corporation Building. Or ask anyone for nizam and u'll be guided well.
‚óè Ambience : the outlet is divided into 2-3 sections, all of which has seating arrangements. While the Roll counter is at one of the corners, made into a takeaway section.

‚óè Food:
* Rolls are fabulous (when hot). Have tried Chicken roll, mutton roll, double chicken roll, egg chicken and egg mutton roll quite a few times. Love them all according to my mood and palate.
* Kebabs are really good. Tried the Chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebab, mutton sheekh kebab. Highly recommended!
* Chicken & mutton Biryani is regular, nothing really spectacular to deserve a mention. Though hundreds of people gorge on it every single day without a complain. My issue is the greasy & sticky Dalda/vanaspati that feels so bad once the rice turns cold. It's absolutely unacceptable when the plate of Biryani looks whitish and the rice feels hard in the mouth. Biryani is an emotion and i can't take it being mishandled.
* the chicken & mutton Chanp isn't up to the mark compared to some of its fellow competitors nearby.
* Firni is okayish.

Well, this average experience doesn't really stop me or anyone giving this heritage institution a regular visit because not everything you do is for a purpose, some are just for emotions.

This place needs no introduction.With it's prime location at new Market one will always find this restaurant buzzing with customers.
Their biriyani is too good to be true.So is their kathi roll.
But this time I tried their biriyani called Tum Tum Mutton Biriyani.This was simply top notch. With generous amounts of dry fruits on top and few moti kababs ....the biriyani is simply picture-perfect.‚ô•Ô∏èthe mutton simply melts in your mouth.I just didn't like the boiled carrots and peas in my biriyani.However one can simply pick and eat as it did not hamper the taste of the dish.
And as I was feeling experimental so went to team the biriyani with Dahi Chicken.OMG!!!!this seemed to be the most delicious decision of my life!!!!I would recommend this dish to everyone.Being the cheapest side dish in chicken I rarely expected much but what was served was finger licking goodness!!!!
And to finish the meal some firni.Goodness overloaded.
HappyEating!

Over the years I have heard so much about nizam. That it serves great food. But I was so disappointed today with nizam that I don‚Äôt have words to express. We ordered chicken tangdi kebab peas pulao and mutton kosha. The kebab was okayish the puloa was horrendous. The mutton kosha was the only thing which tasted fine. Not only the good quality was bad the service was also beyond horrible. None of the waiters cared what we wAnted and when asked behaved as if we were committing a crime. Overall experience was so bad that I would rather go hungry than ever come to nizam‚Äôs.

I have visited this legendary outlet for the very first time today and in a word my experience here is just good. It was around 12.30 pm when we entered the restaurant.
Location : This place is located in New market area just beside the municipal corporation office.
Ambiance : An old heritage building with good sitting capacity. Ambiance is very simple, nothing so fancy. Cleanliness is one factor that should be improved.
Foods : Our today's lunch menu included,
* Veg Pulao
* Chicken Qurma
The food was served within 15 minutes. At first glance the foods appeared nice and as soon as we tasted it was delicious too. Veg Pulao was nice with light aroma. Chicken Qurma was also good. One big piece of chicken along with a half egg was served in the dish. Quantity should be served a little bit more.
Service : Service was good. Prices are reasonable. Our bill was 226 RS along with 5% GST. They do charge 5% GST on the total amount.
Overall it was just a good experience. You can give it a try definitely once.

Was shopping at new market so hopped in at Nizams founder of the famous Kathi Roll obviously for rolls. Wasn't interested in sitting there n having so decided for a take away. Ordered 3 rolls for 2 people.
1 double egg double mutton.
1 single egg single chicken.
1 single egg single mutton.
Pricing was super pocket friendly. Hence a large part of the crowd consisted of college going teens. 
The rolls were delicious n just what the stomach ordered. Lovely balance of flavours with egg n meats not heavy on the palate or the tastebuds. Filling without burning a hole in the pocket. Also special mention of the kulfi served outside the restaurant is a delight as considering it's served on the pavement. 
Will surely visit again when in Kolkata next time.

Known as the inventor of kathi rolls in Kolkata,Nizam's is a very popular eatery in the city...located at the bustling New Market area.The place is spacious without any a.c.Dont expect decorative lights and nice songs in the background,you are not going to get that ambience.Ordered egg chicken aloo roll and fish tikka kabab.The roll was a unique one,as we often dont get to eat egg aloo n chicken stuffed together,but taste wise,it was good but not exceptional,there are many joints who make this kind of kathi rolls.Fish tikka kebab on the other hand was delicious.Soft juicy bhetki with diffrent kinds of chutney was a lovely treat.The place is very much pocket friendly,so if u want to taste the rolls from it's inventor,just come down to Nizam's.

Good place. Good food. Service is good and the staff are very frank and thoughtful. I had my son with me and had ordered chicken(don't remember which item) for him . They told me very politely tht the food was not fresh (cooked in the morning). And so was not good for my child. 
I was very happy to know that they are so thoughtful about their customers and their families.

Located in New Market Area, Nizam's boasts itself as the inventor of Kebab Kathi Rolls, so went there to try those.

Ordered Chicken Kathi Rolls. The rolls were very average, the chicken kebab filling wasn't succulent. In fact there are numerous joints serving better rolls in Kolkata.

But the pocket pinch is very less and the staff are cordial.

Food - 3.5/5

A non-ac hub but a spacious outlet. I have always stopped there to have their rolls. Their rolls are delicious. The firni they serve is great too.
You should drop in for their rolls in the gap of your shopping time at New Market. The only thing that I didnot like about here is the behaviour of staffs.
Last but not the least , if you are thirsty for some cold drinks, you must do away with a glass of water. The MRP of the cold drinks mentioned is Rs.18 , but still they will oblige you with a bill stating that the cold drinks are of Rs. 25. On enquiry , you ll get a cold reply from the waiter like -- " yaha pe yahi dam hai" .

One of the iconic eateries of the city and famous for being the pioneer of the Kolkata Kathi Roll. One must have the much vaunted kathi roll from Nizam's.
We had ordered for the Double Mutton Double Egg Roll. And boy, what a roll it was! The Paratha was slightly crushed by hand before getting coated with two beaten eggs and the mutton pieces coated inside.
Apart from this, the Biryanis (we ordered the Tum Tum Biryani & the Hyderabadi Biryani) and both competed with each other to outclass themselves to win the crown and of one of the worst ever Biryani I ever had in my life. The Tum Tum Biryani comes with two pieces of mutton, barring which the entire plate of rice (with the aloo) is a mockery.of the much loved dish in Kolkata. Equally bad was the Hyderabadi Biryani.
We also had the Mutton Sheekh Kebab. Again looked much like the more popular & delightful Kakori Kebab, but was pretty much nowhere close to the gem from the kitchens of the Lucknow Nawabs.
The parting grace came out to be the Koolfi Faluda. Wonderfully flavoured but you may insist to have it without the Faluda & Rose Water or if you must, ask the waiter to go easy on the Rose Water especially. üòâ

Located in new market area, Nizam's is one of the oldest eateries in kolkata and claims to be the inventor of kaathi rolls. But unfortunately due to some problem in the grill they were not able to serve the rolls or any kebabs. 
We ordered chicken biryani, Special chicken biryani, special mutton biryani and firni. 
The biryanis were tasty, flavoursome and the meat was well cooked and very tender. 
One downside according to my opinion is that they top the special biryanis with cherry cashew and raisins which hinders the taste of biryani for me as i prefer it plain and simple.

Kolkata is known for its Kathi rolls (skewered meat, wrapped in a paratha and served with onions, green chillies and tomato sauce). Nizam pioneered Kathi rolls in the city. I have literally grown up relishing the rolls of Nizam while I have always had better biryanis. I visited Nizam's some week ago for a quick lunch in between shopping but I was left disappointed. Thoroughly. While the Mutton biryani was dry, the chaap was way too oily for my liking. That old charm is lost. Both the quality and quantity has taken a downward turn. If they are willing to keep their hard earned name alive, it's time they do something worthy to save it. :)

Disappointed.. actually very disappointed.
We ordered tandoori roti ,mutton tikiya, veg pulao ,chicken chatpata. First of all we ordered mughlai paratha which was not available. Secondly the veg polao they served was horrible..salt less.. thirdly the mutton tikiya they provided had no keema inside..it was full of some sort of daal or sattu. When I complained about the same i was told 'aj kal tikiya ka zyada order nehi milta' which means nowadays they don't get much orders for tikiya so they prepare tikiyas like this only. Although the chicken chatpata was good. So one point for the chicken chatpata

Pure disappointment .. a big waste of money

The story of the roll has started from here. In around 1930's to save somebody from the messy affair of having parantha and kebab separately, they were rolled and wrapped in a paper, and hence Kathi Roll. One word of caution, they DON'T SERVE BEEF. We've tasted the double mutton roll recentl and the good part if the kathi kebab inside still tastes like meat and very less onion and no capsicum is used. The parantha is really light and flaky - frankly the combo is awesome. But, but, but, we've tasted the worst Biryani (if we can call this thing by the name) here. It was called Tum Tum biryani and Hyderabadi Biryani. Please don't go by the name. Both are the same as regular biryani with some dry fruits put on top and a really really bony meat piece. Avoid it like anything. The Koolfi, on the other hand, is pretty good and recommended.

I hope to get back the old taste again from Nizam's. Cheers.

This place serves all kinds of Mughlai and North Indian food but its mostly known for its kathi rolls.They are infact the inventor of the kathi rolls in Kolkata. If you are in the new market are you have to have the rolls at Nizam's. They don't use sauces in their rolls its just some spices and a bit of lemon. Its a wonder too much how their rolls taste so good even tough they are made with simple ingredients. The other dishes they serve are not the best so you can probably just skip them. They have some really big rolls that suffice as a full meal very well. Strongly recommend this place simply for its rolls.

Visited this place as apparently this is the restaurant that invented the kaati roll. I am not a fan of  kaati roll but thought as they are the inventers it should be special here. The restaurant interiors are not for you if your particular about cleanliness. There are old tables n chairs n interiors that are not welcoming. Had the chicken roll which was ok but full of oil. Had some special nizam kebab which was very dry. Could not finish these two dishes as the oil got to me along with the heat. Had the firni this was superb. Overall an average place with oily but decent food

One of the oldest restaurants of this city . Nizam's certainly does live up to its name . Famous for its rolls and kebabs , this joint is a must try out for any foodie .
.
Situated at the heart of New Market area , beside the Municipal Corporation Office , one can definitely get the strong vibe of an old restaurant as soon as the person steps foot in . This restaurant is clean but quite basic , so you wont find any fancy d√©cor or any modern ambience . This restaurant definitely needs to upgrade its outlook . 
.
Went there a bit early , at around 11.30 am . So many of the items on the menu were not yet available . So even wanted , could not try the Mughlai paratha . Had to stick with Egg chicken kathi roll , Egg mutton kathi aloo roll , paneer roll , chicken kathi kebab , Kulfi .
.
The food came after about 30 mins . And here were two powercuts while we were having our food . But the food itself was terrific . The kebabs were soft and well cooked , not burnt and tasted splendid . The rolls were without any sauce , had the authentic taste and the parathas were crispy and soft . The rolls has only onion and no cucumber , which proves why this restaurant is authentic . The kulfi was good but a bit too sweet , kind of sugary sweet , felt that it could have been much better .
.
Overall it was definitely worth the time and money . And it was proved why nizam always tops the google search for rolls in Kolkata

This is a perfect place for Roll lovers.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è i would close my eyes & come back to this place again & again..!! The place is huge & there is not much to talk about decor..
One can always get a table..Its located near Elite cinema hall esplanade..
Lets talk bout food now...
The rolls are crispy perfectly spiced & massive...To me One roll is enough to shut my tummy for few hours...The kebabs r also delicious but something dey r a bit chewy...
Its a fast food place for all...
Try out once ur gonna come back again..!!

Unfortunately my experience with Nijam's not good at all..went at around 10:30 when the shop was just opening and ordered a chicken roll but what i got is chicken filled paratha made with Stones or something like that..it was so hard that my teeth was paining to chew the thing.. maybe they gave me last night's leftover paratha üò• they are well behaved though

Go here for the mouth watering Indian delicacies. Be it Biriyani, Mutton tikiya, chicken tandoori or chicken chaap, no other restaurant will provide you such quality food at a cheaper rate. 
Whenever we have to visit New Market for shopping,this is the place we sort our lunch at.
The ambience is not extra ordinary but the dishes are excellent. The kathi rolls and firni deserve a special mention.

Well this made my childhood....A place that still provides top notch food ...with mouthwatering nonveg dishes.
The first taste of good kebabs started off with nizam...their rolls are too good too miss.
Back in those days food quality and crowd was more important .
Elegant classy restaurants were not in trend and people used to gather around this love with love and hunger for food.
I was no exception to this and every weekend I used have a kebab , roll and biriyani from nizam .
One of my favourites ,still has its foundation and market strong with tempting delicacies and hence I say dont miss your chance ......
Try Nizam and taste some quality food .

There are certain places in this lazy city of Kolkata that never lets you get away. Situated bang in the middle of New Market, Nizam‚Äôs is one such. Famed as the inventors of the extraordinary Kolkata Kathi Rolls, this 85 year old institution is not only a pilgrimage, but much more. Well, my first interactions with Nizam‚Äôs began way before I was capable enough to digest history, as a middle-class Bengali kid doing the rounds of New Market for Durga Puja shopping. And I am sure there are many others like me. My dad used to be a food enthusiast during those days, and I have heard that the long days of shopping would inevitably end with rolls from Nizam‚Äôs, and I would maybe get a nibble of the kebabs or the paratha, which I would gobble up gleefully. ‚ÄúIf you want beef rolls, you always go to Nizam‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äì my dad often said.
                                                                ...

One of Kolkata's traditional roll and biryani makers. Located just under KMC building number 4. Non AC seating arrangements and bit unhygienic. Biryani taste was good but expected a bit more. Chicken/ mutton pieces were okay. Mutton masala had 2 soft pieces cooked in excess oil. Butter naan was better. Their Famous Kathi kebab does not taste that Special but deserves a try. However a Roll (egg, chicken,mutton) goes very well at the end of the day after marketing at New Market.

Heard a lot about there kathi roll but it does not tastes good and could have been much better.The behavior of the staff is also very rude. But the best part of the roll is they do not use cheap local made souce and their Kabuli nan and kathi kabab are really good in taste.

the rolls are crispy, flaky, perfectly spiced and massive....one roll meal i call it...honestly I have not tried their kebabs but its possibly what they fill into their rolls so I think they would top notch too....the biriyani is stellar.....I love the ambience of this place......

Hailed as the best place for kathi rolls and kebabs, this was a big let down. Very lethargic and careless staff, crumbing interiors, congested seating arrangements and the list goes on. Only saving grace was the chicken main course and the fluffy butter naans.. The much touted kathi kebabs could have been much better.

A very disappointing experience overall.

The mutton kebabs, chicken Biriyani, mutton keema can do wonders, isn't? Well, some places of Kolkata knows exactly how to please your taste buds. Here,this restaurant which is older than 50 years will serve you the best kebabs and mutton keema moghlai. 
Place: Esplanede, Kolkata. 
Location : Nizam's.
In frame : mutton keema moghlai.

Loveeed this place. Had quite a lot of recommendations  from people to try this joint. Didn't disappoint. It's situated right in the heart of new Market. Ordered mutton kathi roll, chicken Kathi kabab . Must try Kathi rolls. Juicy tender mutton pieces and the spices added in it make it even more delicious. It's a beautiful and plain kathi roll with minimal chopped onions and diced chillies. Thank you for sparing the sauce! ;) Super yum! Chicken Kathi kebab- delicious too! Tad a bit on the oily side though. Ambience is below average but the service makes up for it. If you're up for mughlai cuisine - this place is a must try in Kolkata!

Ordered for mutton biryani and mutton kassa. When the order was served got chicken biryani instead. Had already digged into that and the rice was mixed with the kassa gravy so they refused to change it. Lost point on listening skills here. Mutton kassa had too much oil! I mean i know mughlai food is supposed to be rich and heavy. But it was over the top. And in such a humid City Like Kolkata its quite a necessity to have an air conditioning section in the restaurant. I know nizams one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata opened in 1932, perhaps they want to keep their heritage that way. But its really difficult to be roaming shopping in the market and then eating such rich food sitting in a non ac restaurant. Take it under consideration for the comfort of the customers.

Everyone knows that Nizam's is specially known for its lip-smacking kathi kababs. Yesterday two of my friends and I went to hog on kababs. Ambience was okayish with respect to the amount you spend for the food. There's a strong aroma of biriyani all around. One of my friend is vegetarian so she decided to have a paneer roll . And two of us ordered a plate of chicken kathi kabab, one chicken reshmi butter masala and two Nizam's paratha. Within less than 15 minutes our ordered dishes arrived.
Paneer roll - I can't comment on it as I didn't have it .
Chicken kathi kabab- This was the star dish. I could eat this all day. The chicken pieces were juicy and tender with the right amount of the burnt flavour.
Nizam's paratha- This was very crunchy and a bit oily . It went nice with the side dish.
Chicken reshmi butter masala- This dish let me down. The chicken pieces were a little hard to tear off. It contained 5 pieces. And filled with cashews and raisins .
Overall a nice eatery to try out the Indian dishes without a burden on your pocket. Our total bill was Rs 496 including 12% GST . I would go there again to try their other kabab platters.
P.S. - I would request my vegetarian friends not to go there coz you may not like the strong aroma of mutton and chicken :)

Double egg mutton roll is my favourite. Best rolls in town. No sauce. Attitude of waiters are very bad as if they are doing a favour by serving,similar to olypub and coffee house. Best kebabs in town. Dont try the maharaja biryani. Cherries ,cashew and raisins spoil the taste of biryani.

Legend says that this place invented chicken rolls. I dont know much about that but can surely say they are one of the best in the city. Keep your roll simple and spare the sauces to have a proper experience.

This busy legendary restaurant in the heart of new market Offers some great rolls  . The place invites you with a smell of biryani . 
We ordered chicken rolls and kulfi . Rolls came fast and hot .
Taste was too good . Not too much of oil or sauce . 
Kulfi was average . 
There are always a lot of people . This place buzzes with food and laughter throughout the day . 
Rolls here are a must-try thing .

I am just coming back from the place after taking a parcel of two Double Egg Single Chicken roll. They tasted awesome but the staff! 
I hope the authority of Nizam checks this! First of all, I order two Double Egg Single Chicken roll but they misheard it. When I wanted to cancel one Roll and instead told them to prepare a Double Egg Roll without Chicken, I came to know they took wrong order. The staff behaved as if he can never go wrong with taking the order. He told me "Subah se hum yehi kaam kar rahe na" in such a rude tone! When I tried to clear the confusion politely all he told me my showing his palm "Ab chup chap khare raho" as if he's my boss! 
He gave me two Double Egg Single Chicken Roll. He did not give me what I wanted. He behaved so rudely with me that I am compelled to give only a 3 star to this joint. So favourite but such a bad experience. :( so dissapointed!

First of all you will definitely not like the ambiance. Though the place is spacious it's always crowded.
The taste of Nizam's dishes to be honest cannot be compared with other Mughlai dishes. Has always been my fav place to visit whenever I go to Esplanade! They still maintain their traditional recipes since ages. Go visit Nizam's and have your favourite authentic Mughlai dish! :)

The chicken bharta and chicken reshmi butter masala are also very good. I personally love their tandoori rotis. Those are one of the best in kolkata, soft and fluffy.

I almost visited here 5 to 6 times and my favorites are mutton liver roll and kati kebab with egg roll. What a juicy and spicy combination they create on there  warps . I mean if you have just one bite of it, you can taste all the ingredients and flavour yourself. The amount of meat and other stuff is perfect. They served any roll with salad and 2 types of ketchups that will increase the taste of this roll . So if you have a little time on your hand and also you are very hungry then this place is only for you :)

Nizam's as the name of the restaurant indicates Granduar, so is the food that they serve, but not the d√©cor or the panash in service.The standard of service and the interiors are stuck in a time zone. This resturant is a true stalwarth among the grouping of  legendary outlets in Kolkata. For Calcuttans the location of Nizam's is known to them like the back of there hand.
On a hectick shop hopping afternoon when you are around the new market area and feel like gourging  over Rice and Chicken,what better place to doze your hunger pangs, other than Nizam's over its Biriyani and Chicken Chap. The simple Chicken Biriyani is absolutely rightly portioned for one with a big piece of chicken, enough number of quint- essential potatoes and right quantity of long grain of Biriyani rice.Extremely light on the stomach, not at all oily, but extremely flavourfull.Even the aloo in Nizam's Biriyani tastes so uniquely tasty and flavourful, which in this case seems to have added on to the taste of the Biriyani.Chicken Chap had a huge piece of chicken breast , basted in the gravy which was rather moderate to taste with out much flavour and taste of seasom seeds.The huge chicken piece though creates a visual illustration. 
Any ways for the tasty Biriyani and proactive service a Seventy  percent marking for this nostalgick but slowly diminishing King of Good Times.
Oh! By the way, in times of soon approaching GST, menu prices are inclusive of Tax

If you are in the new market area searching for a mughlai restaurant that can fill up your tummy and won't hurt your pocket much, then this is the perfect destination. 
Although there are many other restaurants in this area but it serves the best of them. 
Biriyani, kebabs, Kathi rolls are just awesome here. 
Staffs are very well behaved. 
Price is very reasonable as I said. 
Only the problem with this restaurant is that it's not air conditioned. And sometimes it's very hot inside to dine out.
Otherwise it's a preferred place to visit.

Located around the centre of New Market this old school Mughlai food place will never turn you down. We went there at around 10.30 PM. Mutton Biryani and Lahori Chicken just made the perfect dinner during this Iftaar. The service was good and it was amazing reasonable! In the end we'd ordered Firni as well which was obviously the final feather on the hat. Simply a mouth watering experience.

This was my first time dining in Nizam's and the tide was always upstream against the famed resturant. First of all they have a new menu card with hiked prices than which is given here by zomato. I just forgot to take picture of that menu. It is a non ac restaurant and the fans are not sufficient enough but they are sufficient enough to cool off your dish very very quickly because they are served in temp little higher than room temperature, in my case it was chicken biriyani(cost is ‚Çπ172 not ‚Çπ150 as shown in the menu over here)..Third,the biriyani was too oily and I found the smallest piece of chkn I ever had in my biriyani life. And there was no egg in this ‚Çπ172 priced chicken biriyani. Service was fast as they don't care about serving a COLD dish. Quality was so so. I would not recommend nizam as a place for lunch or dinner until and unless you are very much hungry and does not care for your money..You can try their rolls. They are good

This place has been holding a lot of memories since my childhood. Whenever I used to visit new market, it was a must to grab something at Nizam's. It is one of the oldest food hub in the area. But now it has been taken over by a Bengali Man, so it doesn't sell beef delicacies anymore. But still, it's a must to grab a bite whenever you stop by!

Located in New Market, this place is known for its rolls! Me and my friends went there to have Biryani and Halim since it was Ramzan. The service was pathetic and the waiters treated us badly. Their attitude was as if they didn't want to serve, and even got angry when we ordered food. The Biryani was nowhere near Aminia's , let alone Arsalan's. Quantity was also less as compared to other restaurants. The Halim, too, wasn't that good. It was very simple and much worse than what I once tasted in Paradise, Bangalore. It was more like stew than Halim.

Nizam's is a restaurant with a long-standing legacy in Kolkata's food history.
However, whenever I have dropped in there, it's been for rolls. I haven't tried any other dishes, so I can personally vouch only for the  rolls - be it Paneer or Anda Aloo. The double rolls are a level up and very very delicious. Moreover, the pricing is reasonable.
The ambience is just average but comfortable, it hasn't upgraded itself much to the changing times. The downside is the service - fortunately, I have been served by staff just prompt and good enough, but I have witnessed every time, a couple of lackadaisical others sprawling on chairs, ignoring customers when asked for the menu or tissues, chatting away or even quarreling noisily among themselves. 
To be honest, I love their rolls, and that is the only reason I visit or do a takeaway.

Probably the worst food experience anyone could ever get is to do shopping inside the new market in Kolkata's humid weather and stop in a well know restaurant of Esplanade for Lunch, order for a yummy and deliciously named dish called " Mutton Rogan Josh" and all you get is - a bowl filled with fat and water floating the meat hardly to seen except the bones, if expressing the dish not proper to a very irritated answer by the staff this is how it has been cooked here. Been here quite a many times and the quality has detoriated everytime visited.

Well this place is one of the oldest restaurants in the city. Nizams is famous for its roll and it's kathi kebabs. They invented the roll thing. We tried lachaa paratha with chicken bharta and chicken kathi kebabs and all the dishes were equally good. The price is quite cheap but the ambience is below average. If you guys are a mughlai food lover, this is a good place to try. One major problem is that the whole place doesn't have air conditioner.

I visited Nizam's on the afternoon of 3rd July(Saturday),2017 to grab a Chicken Roll.
The chicken threaded on the skewers were miserly,given that a Chicken Roll now costs Rs.57 here.
The service was quick and the onions,well cooked chicken,squirted lemon juice and crispy paratha satisfied the taste buds.
The interiors looked shabby and needs to be refurbished,especially when their rates are pretty high.
Anyways,will have to be back again later to try out their other signature dishes.

I have been there in a busy afternoon to have lunch after a tiring shopping.  As we were damn hungry we ended up ordering many things starting from Chicken Peshwari kebab, Nizam's lachadar paratha, Tandoori Roti, Nizam's Special Mutton Biriyani & Mutton Roganjosh. Biriyani & Mutton Roganjosh is awesome in taste. Kebab is little dry but it's good in taste. Lachadar Paratha is normal to eat. But any how I don't like their tandoori roti I was hard to eat. Staffs are cordial & good in service. So it's a nice place to eat but nothing fancy rather it's look little shabby. They can improve or renovate their decor .

A few weeks ago i had had a roll from this place (which is famous because of reasons that shall be listed later) and had decided to visit it again for a proper meal, which i'm proud to say i've accomplished! So to start off, Nizam's is a legendary place as they were the inventors of kathi kabab roll in Kolkata (or so they say, and it doesn't hurt the popularity of this place. If you wanna confirm, invent a time machine and go back to the 1930s-40s when the place was established, your popularity wouldn't be hurt either). I visited it at about 12 noon on a Sunday when the place was relatively vacant and thus, didn't have to deal with any obnoxious crowd and this definitely helped the ambience. The seating arrangement is pretty simple and though not up to the level of high class fancy fine-dines, still of standard quality in the new market area. Didn't get an AC though. Anyway, the best part about visiting Nizam's is the smell that permeates from the kitchen. That delicious aroma of scrumptious kebabs will entice any warm blooded human being calling himself/herself a foodie. I'm sure others who have visited Nizam's can attest to this fact. The service was good, but has room for improvement. The waiters were polite and all but couldn't help much with details about the items listed in the menu. Also, the rate card has been updated and everything is slightly more expensive than what is listed on zomato. However additional taxes were not imposed over the price that was listed (Yesssssss). Now coming to the food: i had ordered the famous Kathi kebabs and kabuli naan, both of which were excellent. If you have never had a kabuli naan, i implore you to try it. The kebabs were juicy and had all the right spices but i must add that these are best enjoyed while they are still hot (not sizzler or burn-your-tongue standard though). Also i must add the mutton kathi kebab roll which i had the previous day. It's an absolute treat. Please go and try it if you are a fan of rolls (or even if you're not, as the rolls of this place will definitely convert you to one). Overall, Nizam's definitely lives up to its legendary status for making one of the best rolls in the city, and is a good place to visit in the New Market area.

A legendary restaurant serving Mughlai dishes. An old place concentrating only on quality of food and so can't expect a fancy decor. This place is paradise for all Biriyani lovers. We ordered mutton biriyani, Chicken lababdaar and chicken reshmi butter masala. However I'm not a big fan of their firni.

Nizam's came into existence in the 1900 in the city of Calcutta in a quest to bring lip smacking and quick Indian food to the English. They also hold a historical significance in the food business, i.e they gave birth to the famous Kathi Rolls that is popular and an all time hit across India now. 

If you are looking for good food to be served in seconds of placing the order at pocket friendly rates look no where. 

The restaurant is very basic and even has no air conditioning system irrespective of being in Kolkata! 
Tables laid are fairly large. Also don't expect couches. They have plain wooden benches to rest your butt. 

What they excel in is the food they make. From kebabs to rolls to Biryani everything is a delicacy here. The rolls are filling and the biryani is oily, exactly how it should be.

It is recommended to give them a visit if you are in Kolkata and hungry after a lot of haggling with the shopkeepers in the New Market area.

Cheers!

Dropped in there yesterday evening, Don't expect any hygiene and cleanliness from there as its just like a local eatery.
Ordered some Egg rolls and chicken kathi kabab, Food was good but lil bit on the oily side.
And yes one more thing Don't go by there zomato menu card which is still not updated as they had increased there prices recently I guess.
Over all a happy eating!

A busy market place eatery that also smells of nostalgia and old times. The rolls and kathi kabab (both chicken and mutton) are excellent. Biryani and other items are just okay. At ‚Çπ 187/- I expected more from the mutton biryani, but then it wasn't bad either. Service is good and real fast.

After a really hectic day of exam, some other works followed by a match at Eden gardens had dinner with freind at Nizam's near new market area.

Heard about the craze of kathi roll here & wanted to try that, but changed my mind at the last moment. I was really hungry, so went for chicken biriyani & mutton kasha. Food arrived on our table within 3 minutes.

Food was good. Flavour of biriyani was soothing, quantity was good, but the piece of chicken wasn't. (3.3/5)

That mutton kasha had 2 good chunks of tender mutton in a delicious gravy. Went well with that biriyani. (3.7/5)

You can visit it to have good biriyani, great kathi roll etc at reasonable price. But don't expect good ambience, I think some old popular places in kolkata have some similarities among them, they all have doubtful hygiene & rude staffs. But one should visit these places atleast once ignoring all these.

Visited this place after many years. To me, this place bring out nostalgic memories of my college days.

I could recall that Nizam's never had an aesthetic decor but had an old world charm. The interior has not improved much, probably a bit more shabby than the past. Lack of AC in this summer heat is another reason of people staying away from it. 

We ordered Paratha and Chicken Kathi Kabab, Chicken Biryani and Mutton Chaap. The first two items were usual. Kathi Kabab taste remains more or less same. The Biryani rice was overcooked and had mild spices. Mutton chaap was tasty but filled with chwey fats of mutton.

So, if you plan to visit Nizam's anytime soon, I would recommend sticking to the paratha and kathi kabab. And, do not forget to plead with the manager to ask the owner to sell the place to someone who can bring its lost glory back.

#chickentandoori was normal like any other mughlai resturant.

if ur planning to visit new market area.. dnt forget to visit Nizam. 
I would say one day it'll famous for its #nizamspecialcheezkebab as it's famous for its #kathiroll

On my trip to Kolkata, I with one of my friend have decided to visit this place. 
Well, it's an age old restaurant that has a very basic ambiance and doubtful hygiene. 
They have an open kitchen where you can easily see how the parathas they made. 
Well, regarding the food, we ordered Chicken Kabab Roll, Mutton Kabab Roll, Chicken Biryani and Mutton Seekh Kabab. 
All the dishes we ordered were marvelous. Rolls have the meat which were soft, fresh and juicy and paratha was very crisp and well cooked. 
Mutton seekh kabab were also roasted properly and served with onion salad which gives it a unique taste. 
But the eye-catcher dish was "Chicken Biryani". It was so light and tasty that you want to crave it more. It was properly cooked had a very nice aroma and chicken pieces were very soft. A must try dish when you visit herr. 
Their service was quick but the staff seems bit rude. Otherwise, everything was fine.

Well Nizam is called the establisher of kathi roll..I eat their chicken and mutton kathi rolls...The chicken or mutton tandoori pieces in roll is so delicious..
Bt the main thing is their biryani..I brought one plate mutton biryani and one plate nizam special mutton biryani..the normal mutton biryani is better than the special..Its so tasty..Their biryani is less fatty..

The place has a long history associated with it. The ambience should not be a consideration for food lovers. Has been a regular visitor for its rolls, biriyani.
Roll is famous over here but I feel it's OK type, not much to crave for. Special Biriyani is good. pulao can be tried as well. Cheese kebab and mutton sheekh kebab are nice.mutton chaap and Rogan Josh is a personal favourite. Though few times the quality(softness) of meat in the dishes varies, but overall it's quite decent.

This place (Nizam's) is of historical importance to foodies. Nizam's was started in early 1900 by Hasan Reza who wanted to feed hungry office workers and shoppers. So, he started making Kathi kebabs and parathas in a very small stall. 
How did they turn to rolls? The English didn't like the oil coming in contact with their hands, and so the novel idea of wrapping these two in a piece of paper came into being and rolls were born. 
Nizam's rolls are to Kolkata what the sandwich is to Mumbai; made in a jiffy and eaten on the run. 
Their rolls begin at a happy price of ‚Çπ20/- and cater to everyone from ladies shopping in the area to tourists.

Don't expect ambience, but expect the nicest food around New Market Area!

Nizam's is a customary topic of my father's nostalgic discussions and revelations. Thus, the name buzzes in my ear, more than any other restaurant's name in Kolkata. The outlet is located under the KMC main building at the back side of New Market, Esplanade, and is known for it's invention of the Kolkata famous kathi rolls.¬†
But, unfortunately today, there are many a place which delivers much better kabab rolls than the inventor. I personally found it okayish but nothing to brag about. However, one day during lunch, I had been there to have a go at their biriyani. We ordered Murgh Biriyani, Chicken Tandoori Murgh Kathi Kebab. The biriyani was undoubtably one of the best I ever had in Kolkata. It was an ecstatic conglomeration of every ingredients that embrace to deliver a plate of the best of biriyani. On the contrary, the kababs that came with it disappointed us to such an extent that the pleasant aftertaste of biriyani went for a toss ! The kababs were all burnt with a "not-so-fresh" smell of chicken churning out loud. Coming to service, it was fast and the behaviour of the staffs were on the okayish side.
All in all, I would recommend people to visit this place for two reasons - BIRIYANI and NOSTALGIA !

Today I was visited this place to try their famous egg chicken kathi kabab roll and chicken kathi kabab. Nothing much to say about the ambience.  Now let's talk about the foods.. 
Egg chicken Kathi roll was ok not that good.  Paratha was crispy.  But very less amount of chicken pieces which was very disappointment. 

Chickien kathi kabab was good in taste.  But chicken pieces was little bit dry. 

Service was good but the staff was not very friendly and helpful.  Very rude behavior. 
 Overall frist time visit it was not a good experience.

If I could have ever possibly fallen in love with a Chicken roll, this was it. After hearing about their Kathi rolls, I finally got to taste one. And it was an absolute lip smacker! The highlight was obviously the paratha which was soft and fluffy, a welcome contrast to the greasy crumbly parathas most joints serve. The chicken was well marinated and juicy, sweetness of the onions and a generous hit of lemon juice made the humble chicken roll irrestible. Another visit is on the cards to sample their other dishes.

We had biryani and chaap ---- the Nargis biryani was sweetish, had double portions of chicken (not very tender) . The meat portions were huge, two of us couldn't finish it. Service was very quick, food was more than value for money.....But this ain't the best. This ain't topping charts for me .... However it is reliably good for a biryani fix.

Major Disappointment!

I don't know what is the reason for the craze of the name Nizam, I did find it quite mediocre. The biryani is ok and in good balance of flavors but my chicken piece was not so soft, it was rather chewy. They might are the oldest roll in the city, but again the mutton roll was too chewy..

Come here after aeon's! This place has shrunk since the late sixties and early seventies?. 

So has the quality, their Rolls were iconic and it was a must have if around its more Famous Neighbour, New Market.

The Rolls were a faint shadow of juicy, tasty lip smacking ones of the earlier years.

The kulfi was just iced sweetened water with a little Falooda draped on it.

The redeeming factor was the phirni.

What a come down.

I tried the chicken biryani and a chicken dish which was too delicious. I was so delighted even I saw the biryani rice with no extra added colour which I usually saw though it was so touch on taste. They cook it in ghee which makes the rice separate and shine which makes it more craving towards the biryani. After coming from Kolkata. I even parcelled two box of it. It was that tasty and ma family likes it too. Must try place if you are a biryani lover

Nizam's manna offering in the smell n taste of nizam's Lachhedar Paratha n mutton chanp n the faluda is pure sinful. Mall hopping foddies might find the place less inviting but the ones worth their salt should 'revisit' this place.

After months of planning, we finally got the time to visit them. It was a joint birthday treat of mine and Anjali to our friends. From the Esplanade more, turn right towards Elite cinema hall. From Elite, again turn right and the restaurant will fall on your left. We got there at around 1.30pm. The place was bustling with people. There was no AC. But each table had two fans over them. Today the weather was not that hot. But I suppose it must get unbearable in summer. Coming to the food, we ordered 2Chicken Biriyani, 1mutton Biriyani, Kashmiri Pulao, Paneer Shahi Masala and 1Tandoori Roti. Service was very efficient. Our orders were taken right away and was served quickly as well. The dishes were not warm. Especially the Paneer Shahi Masala. But it tasted delicious. The Kashmiri Pulao was was good too except for the white pieces of something we didn't recognise at all which tasted a bit sour. Our friends had the Biriyani. The meat pieces were very well-cooked. The flesh fell right off the bone at the slightest touch. The prices were reasonable too though I could not understand what they meant by non-taxable. Anyway it was a good meal. The quantity of Biriyani was huge and all our friends were satisfied. @

This is really an amazing place with history associated to Kathi rolls invention dating back to #1900s. Although place interiors are just average but the kathi rolls were totally amazing. ¬†I've tasted their two of the best rolls, which were totally mouth watering. i.e., ¬†Paneer Aloo Roll and the popular Double egg roll. ¬†I would love to go to this place again.

Their ambience and staffs are decent.But the actual x factor of this restaurant is their food.
Coming to food I had tasted Hyderabadi mutton biriyani,fish amritsari,chicken zafrani malai kebab and chicken reshmi butter masala.
Zafrani malai kebab-Tasted awesome.Best of all dishes I tasted.chicken was perfectly cooked with spices and you can actual get the essence of zafran in it.Absolutely yummy.
Hyderabadi mutton biryani- It tasted well n good.The meat in it was soft that it melts  in the mouth.
Chicken reshmi butter masala-Again it was just outstanding.Soft and succulent.You will definitely want more after tasting it.
Fish amritsari-I tasted this dish for the first time.It was a bit oily.Apart from that it was all ok.
Overall a wonderful experience.Food lovers should definitely try this food joint because they will offer you excellent food at a very affordable price.

The biryani has an enormous portion size and tasted okayish. The chicken bharta was not technically shredded chicken but contains tiny chunks of chicken in a delicious rich gravy that went pretty well with the biryani. The decor is modest, service was decent and the place has good value for money. I will go back to try out the rolls sometime soon.

A shopping spree at new Market that too without food?? That's so not me. Nizam's being one of the legendary ones needs no introduction. We had lunch there today. Although the rolls seemed to top the charts I wanted to have biriyani. The Kathi kebab looked appealing and hence I tried that too. Quantity wise the chicken biriyani was okayish but the sad part is it contained small a piece of chicken which lacked marination. The rice was too salty for my taste .The kebab pieces were minute and presented with burnt onions, chili flakes and lemon wedges.  Well at 140 bucks one certainly can't expect better than that. Service is faster than lightning. Will try rolls on the next visit.
P.S- they charge 14.5% VAT

Ahoy old friend.... When i was in college... Me n my friends used to come here frequently. Though the visits lessened over the time, but old time came back when me n my bestie met and chat over biriyani and yummy tangri kebab. Taste was good as usual... Tangri kebabs were lip-smacking tasty. Person attending us was soo helpful and patient with our demands and food deciding times. Thumbs up.

Sudden visit to this place and was quite impress with the food. Location is new market near hogg market. Ambiance is below average. Staff were very nice and helped us in placing order. We ordered nizams paratha, mutton kassa, mutton sikh kabab and salad. Mutton kassa was tasted heavenly , sikh kabab was okayies and nizams paratha was very oily and not upto the mark. Overall good experience, very pocket friendly. Looking forward to visit again and try their kathi kabab.

A shopping spree at new Market that too without food?? That's so not me. Nizam's being one of the legendary ones needs no introduction. We had lunch there today. Although the rolls seemed to top the charts I wanted to have biriyani. The Kathi kebab looked appealing and hence I tried that too. Quantity wise the chicken biriyani was okayish but the sad part is it contained small a piece of chicken which lacked marination. The rice was too salty for my taste .The kebab pieces were minute and presented with burnt onions, chili flakes and lemon wedges.  Well at 140 bucks one certainly can't expect better than that. Service is faster than lightning. Will try rolls on the next visit.
P.S- they charge 14.5% VAT

This is a legendary place and located near hogg market. I've heard so many good reviews about their Kathi rolls and kebabs but never had the opportunity to going there. 
Yesterday after completing our shopping at Esplanade, we decided to try their rolls. So we reach there near about 2PM and ordered one egg chicken kathi rolls and one chicken rolls.. The taste was amazing. After finishing our rolls we Ordered mutton keema mughlai(forgot to click the pic) cause i never tried keema mughlai before nd frankly speaking i didn't like the taste that much, taste was very average. 

Staff were good 
Ambiance was simple. 

Must go fr tried their rolls nd kebabs only.  :D

Nizam and its kathi roll needs no introduction. The location is very easy to find. We went there to have a roll or two but ended up ordering so much food. We had Nizam's lachcha paratha, butter tandoori roti, egg curry, chicken kasa, Chicken kathi Kabab and chicken Sammi Kabab. One lachcha paratha is big enough for a person. You would feel full after having one. It was really soft in the centre and crispy on top, just the way I like it. Butter tandoori roti was so soft and yummy. Kathi Kabab needs no intro. Perfectly spiced. The Sammi Kabab was good. Nothing extraordinary. Egg curry was average. Chicken kasa was really spicy and oily. Except the oily part I liked it. We had so much in just Rs 555. Affordable, good quantity and quality.
Would visit again.

Nizam's is one of the popular destination for the Mughlai cuisine lover that don't need any kinda intro.

Location - Located at the centre of the heart of city, New Market Area. Find the lane behind the Corporation Building of New market area. Go straight taking that lane and you will find Nizam's at the left side.

Ambiance and Service - Nothing fancy about the decoration. They had two part of sitting arrangement for dining in. The sitting arrangement is not so comfortable. Old Sofa and table sitting arrangement. Service is fast but the behaviour of the stuffs are not good. Some are rude and don't treat the customer well.

Menu - Nizam's is known as one of the founder of Kati roll in Kolkata. Beside this they also offer various variety of roll, Kabab and mughlai dishes. Among all of them Chicken Peshawari Kabab is one of my fav kabab. Beside this we also ordered two Laccha Paratha and Kadai chicken.

Chicken Peshawari Kabab - Juicy chicken legs with charcoal grilled aroma, what you expect more! In one word it is just awesome. 6 Pieces chicken are there and served with Green Chatney and Onion. But last time when I ordered this item, it was too much grilled, so a burning aroma was there which is really no negotiable.

Laccha Paratha - Paratha made in old traditional way. Nothing extra ordinary but well fried and crispy in nature.

Kadai Chicken - As a side dish with Paratha, it is ok. Mid spicy and little sweet in nature. Overall good. 4pieces good sized are there in sweet, mid tangy gravy. Not super but goes well with any kinda Paratha or Roti.

Pricing - With all the item mentioned above it cost 450INR, which I think pretty decent amount for two persons. When it comes the matter about Vat and Tax, Nizam's didn't take that. But from my last visit I noticed that they had started to add up Vat, Tax and SC also. Don't know the reason why.

In conclusion it is obvious that Low pricing and craze about the Kati roll is the ¬†main UPS for Nizam. Pocket friendly and good quality food, for this I want to visit this restaurant again and again.

One of the classics of Calcutta. A must visit of you are all about good food and good vibes. The place has a very welcoming gone-by-era ambience. The waiters are casual, but that in no way means their service is lagging. We had the classic biriyani, and the cherry on top was the extra potato piece that was there to order. For desserts there was firni. Do visit for a taste of authentic calcutta cuisine.

Mutton kathi kababs and chicken kathi kababs are something I really love at nizams. They taste really good. 
The shortcomings of this place are it's ambience and unavailability of many items listed on their menu card. 
The place is always overcrowded and the waiters are really not bothered about you. 
Their food is good no doubt. Therefore I suggest to have their food home delivered.

The beef kebabs were so great..
We had chicken biriyani and a couple of chicken dishes..
The quality has definitely dropped.

The hustle and bustle remains the same at Nizam's - day or night. The rolls, the parathas, the angeethi kebabs - the process remains the same - except that no more do you get beef - its only M or C. A visit to Kolkata and a visit to Nizam's is kind of synonymous. 

I like my rolls without the condiments and sauces that the roadside carts offer and Mumbai has taken that to a new ridiculous level and named it Frankie. Let's get back to Nizam's!!

The paratha in any kathi kabab roll is the key differentiator for me - and I am yet to find a replica of what Nizam produces. The soft, elastic , crisp  circles engage your taste buds as soon as you bite into them.

The rustic mutton botis grilled on skewers are refried with some onions and green chillies and then wrapped with the parathas. Delightful!!

You may have the kababs and the parathas separately too.

We had ordered Mutton Biryani too. The rice was flavourful and well done. The mutton was I thought a bit undercooked. 

Satiated to the core, we will be back on our next sojourn to Kolkata!!

During my most recent visit I ordered a plate of the famous kathi kebab and Nizam's paratha.The kebabs were immensely flavorful and tender served with caramelized onions and freshly cut green chillies. My only concern was the excess oil that the kebabs came with.
 Ended my meal with a firni which I found to be overly sweet with a strong essence of saffron. The service is very prompt even when the place is buzzing with people on a busy weekend.¬†
It is worth a visit if you are looking for a pocket friendly place to have an appetizing meal !!

Tge waiters still wear the good old style dresses the aroma and taste of food is classic. 

This place is not air conditioned so no taxed on food which also a big plus point.

My recommendation is buriyani chap and bhuna

Located in the New Market Area, I used to love Nizam's for the quality beef preparations they used to provide. Was very disappointed to know that they had stopped providing beef items for months though. Had to settle my hunger with chicken biriyani and firni though. Nizam's firni is the best thing at the price.

As the restaurant is known for its mouthwatering rolls, we were definitely not disappointed by having them! We ordered egg chicken roll and egg mutton roll. Both were equally tasty and yummy! Quality worth the price and it is pocket friendly as well. But they could have decorated the place. Decor is poor.

 As a biryani lover we walked at lunch time, the restaurant had good crowd. Perfect blend of spices & fragrances no flavors overpowering, the quantity was also enough.

Being a calcuttan have heard a lot about this place but never got the opportunity to visit.finally a few days back went there with a friend of mine.After having their biriyani i truly felt they are a legend in this sector.the biriyani had a 'dil-ko-choo-jaanewali-taste'.absolutely loved it.the mutton kebab was nothing extraordinary,felt more like filling inside a mutton roll.but the biriyani absolutely won our heart!üòä

Review of moghul garden (beef serving section of nizams):
I have been here a lot of time...this is the place where i tried beef kebabs for the first time and it was the best beef kabab i have ever had..the meat pieces of the kebab they used to serve before was chunky and kind of dry (and i liked it that way) but now they serve the meat pieces smaller than before and it comes with reddish marinade unlike before and it is equally tasty and well cooked (though i miss that chunky part)...beef biryani they serve is also good,lightly spiced with big pieces of meat (sometimes meat lacks tenderness but not always),their beef chap is the best chap i ever had, and the firni is like cherry on the top...overall it is a good eatery at low price...one must visit..

16.3.2016- RIP MOGHUL GARDEN...WE'LL MISS YOU...(they don't serve beef anymore...won't be visiting again..

I have visited this place a few time. This is another one of those Classic Biryani joints which has their own unique Biryani. They have this uniqueness of serving Biryanis with dry fruits which I really liked. The different types of Kebabs here especially Kati kebabs are really mouth-watering. Phirni is simply heavenly, I really liked it. The prices are totally affordable & with Tax included. The staff are good but they will ask for Tips. Overall its a 4/5 place. Hope to visit soon.

Located just beside Aminia, this is one of the best Biryani Restaurants in Kolkata. The ambience is decent but it's a non-ac restaurant. We ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka Kebab and the quality of the food was very good along with good quantity. We didn't have to wait for long for the food as their serving is one of the fastest. Prices are reasonable too. This place is a must visit!

This is one of the finest and old Calcutta biriyani restaurants. I had passed through this place a number of times but never entered. It's located in the street called 'Mughal Garden' just beside Aminia and Alibaba.

Well it's a non-ac restaurant but undoubtedly, it's very clean. The ambience is quite good.
Their best thing is their service. I didn't have to ask for anything. It was amazing. 

Coming to the biriyani, it was tasty, but what I felt lacking was it's quantity. Otherwise it was great.

A must visit in the winter for everyone üòÄ

There was a time when nizams used to be THE place to go for a proper kati roll. No one could make the khiri roll better than nizams. Sadly the place is just existing on hype due to its prestige in the yester years. The quality of the rolls, biryanis and rezalas has deteriorated. There is still an old world feel in the place but the old tastes are missing.

Nizam used to be the quintessential Biryani food joint in Calcutta. Now that there are a hundred others, they're struggling to keep up. On a personal level, I do believe both Nizam and Mughal Garden are fantastic. They've maintained a level of consistency over the years that is hard to do. But very recently, they decided to take beef off their menu.

Their food is always good, from their Biryani to their Bhuna. The rolls are outstanding compared to the ones you get elsewhere. They're also a tad bit cheaper than most other mainstream joints. The service is very fast, and very efficient. The waiters are friendly, and you won't have to ask them twice.

Food seems to be their point of excellence. It's not a very clean or well maintained restaurant, but it fits the after college bill. 

Ambience: 1.5/5

Nizam's had been consistent in maintaining its "charizma" even after 84years...Its been a great crowd puller in its locality...First we ordered CHICKEN SHAHI QURMA and PARATHA and then we went for the "CHICKEN BIRIYANI"- one of their specialities...Each food item had its unique Nizam's flavour...Besides these, the well mannered staffs, spacious seating arrangement ,& the prompt service has helped this place gain popularity over the years. Overall a nice experience for me at NIZAM.

Took to nizams after a hectic day at court. Special mutton biriyani and butter chicken was on the agenda. Biriyai was not too oily, mutton pieces were quite big and soft. Butter chicken was good, a tad too oily, the thing which astounded me was the service and the behaviour of the servers, so well mannered. All in all a good place.

And for a biriyani lover. We ordered Mutton biriyani, chicken chap. The pieces were soft, tender. I would love to visit this place again and again. But -0.5 because of the condition of the furniture, they can renovate it a little.

Pathetic mutton biryani for 160 bucks!!! I would rate any roadside stall selling hot mutton biryani better than this.
         Positives- The piece of mutton in the biryani was soft.The quantity of biryani was more than sufficient for one.
Negatives- You have to dig into the mutton to find out the flesh inside.The size of the mutton isn't adequate. Though not too oily the biryani lacks taste. The piece of potato was hard to break, totally undercooked. 
           Completely dissatisfied with the quality. Would never recommend to anyone. Knowing this place over 2 decades today understood whatta disaster it is!!!

The biriyani and the chicken roll is just too yum.
I think this is the only restaurant that I have been to who adds lemon juice in their rolls and trust me it goes really well.
The chicken biriyani is perfect to be precise, not too oily, not very spicy and extremely pocket friendly.
The service is real quick. The only bad thing about this place would be the absence of an air conditioner. However am sure the price will go up if they add one. 
So, we can compromise a little :)

The kebabs here are famous too, however every time I end up ordering the biriyani.

Except the fact that this place doesn't have Air conditioning - this legendary place is near perfect otherwise !! 

While good Biriyani you can get at few other places as well ( Arsalan, Royal, Rahmania), you wouldn't get better rolls anywhere. Have whatever floats your boat - Chicken, Mutton, Single Egg, Double Egg - hell, even the veg roll tastes good here. 

If you want to have genuine Calcutta rolls, please take the effort and visit this place. It will be worth it!

They wrapped few pieces of chicken in a lachha paratha. The paratha and chicken separately took my heart but their combination us very bad. The kabab they gave in the roll was good but as the roll was very dry the I did not like the roll

I have always loved Mughlai food and a visit to the Nizam's was better late than never! It's a no nonsense place where you come only to eat. Certainly not a place for fine dining but who cares!! 
We ordered the chicken seekh kebab followed by chicken double egg kathi roll & a plate of chicken biryani.. Although the biryani tastes can't match that of Aminia, but the roll was the best I had and pretty much reminded me of kathi rolls in Khan market. 
Just shop at new market or Hoggs market & take a food break at Nizam's!

This used to be one of our favourite beef places. But they have stopped serving beef from the main restaurant. The Nizam's Mogul Garden next door now serves the beef items. 

I have found Nizam to be a very inconsistent place. One day you will be served one of the best Biryanis, while the next day it might not be that good. Thankfully the good days are slightly more than the bad ones. 

On most occasions I order the Biryani, Mutton Tikia and Tandoori Roti. And of course their special double egg double mutton rolls.

Located near New market, shopping and Nizam's roll is synonymous with kolkatans.

I absolutely love Nizam's egg chicken roll and beef rolls.

Damn! These uncouth idiots don't even know how to speak to customers. I ordered a roll but he had his own agenda ready, he took a jab on me, instead. Didn't even say thank you at end of it. Because of the recommendation on the internet I went to this unhyginic restaurant from the medieval age. No wonder why I was treated in such a rude manner. The 'great Chicken Khati Roll' was as shitty as that beard worn Chacha was. So greasy and unhealthy. The amount of the chicken was so little. God knows what the image, taste that they are taking away with them to associate them later with Kolkata. Surely I can take'em to a whole bunch of good places to eat. It's a disgrace that on the internet Nizam's is claimed to be representing one of the delicacies of Kolkata. Shame!

The heritage of all Mughlai places is the Nizam's which is in Esplanade since ages. It is also known that Nizam is the first roll counter of Kolkata as well.

With the least possible ambient surrounding and it's minimal decor this legendary joint mainly prioritise over it's Mughlai delicacies. üçó

I've tried a few of them :
Here biryanis are kinda different, once i opted for Tum Tum biryani and Nargis biryani and both had a hint of sweet taste which was a little outlandish with respect to other joints, silly it was but somehow I liked the taste. Another extra mention they serve biryani with cashews kismis dry nuts spreader over the bed of biryani.
A few side dishes like chicken chap chicken rezala were detectable with the perfect preparation, which went well with that sweet biryani.
Among starters we went for chicken reshmi kabab...this pick was just delicious with soft succulent meat pieces and with it's oh-so-tasty pudina curd chutney!
And we ended the meal with the grand Phirni which I'll say was the showstopper of all... Till date Nizam's serves the best phirni of all times in Kolkata. Do try their phirni once...what a consistency with proper usage of kesar with a extravagant taste.
Another time I've tried the rolls of Nizam's as it had quite a reputation for that ....and it turned out to be awesome with house special filling in it, with no use of red sauce in it...dhaniya chilly mix in it.

Overall I was impressed with this restaurant, no doubt of the legacy it created of its own!

Nizam's the so much talked about and worshipped old jewel of Kolkata is living it's life washing the feet of its old Glory . Something that is quite similar to almost all the mughlai oldies of New Market which once was the North Indian power house of the city . The reason is pretty simple, they have simply failed to fight out the newbies in the market . With Nizam it's more so, because of the pride they have in everything they do , they donot even want to improve the ambience and create more branches . Although , I heard some work is going on in the Mughlai garden i donot have any news that it is of renovation .In terms of food quality , if you are a person who has always heard of Nizam but never visited will end up having a good affair but will also think that it is simply not worth the hype .

¬∞ Location :- The shortest way if you are coming from Metro is to come out of the tunnel that's closest to the Roxy cinema lane . Then you will enter that lane and walk past Roxy cinemas . On reaching the end you will have glance of Mughal Garden some few meters away and there is your destination .

¬∞ Ambience ( 2 / 5 ) :- Probably the worst part of the legendary restaurant . Almost every restaurant has an AC and a non-Ac section . But this one doesn't , it has some awkwardly faced fans which almost does no justice . On days of sweltering heat it is not a comforting experience . It's not that you can't seat there but it is not the place in which you will like to have good food . The tables and chairs are very old and it pains to see that even after getting a good footfall work has not been done to renovate a legend like Nizam .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
¬∞ Food :- So much has been talked about of their rolls and kebabs . Some of them even say that nizam has the best rolls . Here's what we ordered :-

1. Chicken Kathi kabaab ( 4 / 5 ) :- This is a legendary dish and it deserves to be so . This is basically grilled in a stick and then the kabaab is cut into pieces and served with sauted onions and mirchi . This is a stunning dish . No chicken pieces will not melt in you mouth , they are chewy and spicy and perfect to go with caramelized onions . Some , nimbu on it and they will taste heavenly . Yes , this is an item worth having and you will never get anywhere other than Nizam's .

2. Egg Mutton Roll ( 3 / 5 ) :- Yes it is a 3 pointer . The so called legendary roll has not lived upto the expectation . Firstly there is no such Kathi roll , they are basically chicken and mutton roll and the meat that is served inside them are basically Kathi kabaab .  So, the best part of the roll was :-

1. The delightful crunchy and hot parotha . There was not a single bit of chewiness and one could easily feel that this is why it has gained so much attention.  The paratha is simply lovely and light . 

2. The egg was spread  nicely .

3. Served hot 

The fact that after getting some very important points right , it still failed to impress me was :-

1. Meat . The mutton was not at all soft rather very very chewy . We kept and chewing and chewing and then starter questioning as to what exactly we were having . Moreover the quantity of meat was not the best .

2. The size of the roll is medium considering the price 

Maybe the chicken is a better option but i was not buying the excuse . If you are good at something akways make it like it is the best . And that roll was not . A better bet would be the Hot kathi roll in park street . You have to be really good to beat that .
 
3. Firni ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- It was a good firni and I was almost willing to give 4 points but I felt the quantity was lesser as compared to its other mughlai counterparts . The firni had a strong scent and the melted in the mouth . You can always have it here and will not repent .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- Although they are lightning fast and really really well behaved . They also served us really dirty plates . Since it was just a roll I didnot create much fuss about it.  But hygiene is a real issue if are very particular about this . 

One again i have e felt that the best part of any mughlai great in new market is their kabaabs . They are the sole reason why you still want to take a time of your previous schedule and come here and have a great time . 

So Nizam may have created a lot of memories for the people of the older generation they are no longer a force to reckon with . As of now they are still living under the shadow created by their old Glory . Do visit for the kabaabs though , the kathi kabaab is an absolute delight and i am sure the other kabaabs are as well . And yes no taxes .

Nizam's, a very old place in Kolkata which is famous for its Kathi Rolls. It was my first time in Nizam's and we went for lunch. We ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken Do Pyaza. The food tasted great and was quite adequate on the quantity. It was less oily and was just awesome. It is not impressive if you look at the ambience, but Nizam's definitely scores high with great food and service quality. Overall 4/5.

I don't really get why people talk so blatantly about this restaurant . Let's start with ambience , there is none ! Dirty tables , dirty spoon , people are running around shouting .Cheese Kabab was horrendous , kathi roll was average and biriyani was nothing special either . I don't know how legendary this restaurant used to be but clearly it's time has gone and I won't visit it anytime soon

First off all, sorry for churning out all the reviews on the same day, normally am too lazy to write a review ¬†and also having too little time to write abt stuff with all the travelling so i will write 10-15 at a time from now on instead of writing one right after visiting
i remember , almost 18 yrs back when my uncle, first took me here and we stood inside the shop, watching as the man makes the roll. truth to be told, love at first sight er.. taste :). even though my uncle is no more, i still go here from time to time and take 2 rolls.. one for me and one for him and i guess will keep doin that..
as off other dishes , well i nvr tried and nvr want to..

Kathi kabab, mutton biriyani and chicken qorma. The three dishes that we ordered while at nizam's. Nizam's are one of the very famous biriyani seeking place for esplanade shoppers. As heard from my dada they make absolutely brilliant kathi roll. Well... I was certainly not impressed. Not with any of the three! The qorma had no taste and the biriyani was really below average.

Whenever I visit this part of our Kolkata, whether shopping at New Market, or just a casual stroll .... Nizam's rolls and kebabs are must .My favourites are Chicken /Mutton Boti Kebabs, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Mutton Chap and of course Biryani. The Firni offered here is one of the best in Kolkata

When you shop around the New market streets , the moment you passes by the place the auro of that mughlai and kebabs will for sure tempt you.

And the famous kathi Rolls , its teh best what they serve.

I assume the renowned Kathi Roll concept have rises from here itself.

Last night had dinner in nizams. There's nothing much to ¬†reiterate about the restaurant since its a very familiar mughlai food joint at heart of the city.So coming to the food,tried the mutton chanp,kashmiri pulao, nargisi kofta & kulfi. I simply loved the nargisi kofta. Didn't expect such a fabulous veg preparation in a restaurant which is famous for its non veg food basically.2 big size kofta's were served along with thick creamy gravy.I could locate mild ajwain flavor & hint of chilies with dry nuts loaded in the kofta & they were immersed into the shahi gravy with lots of cream & grated chena. Highly recommended dish for any foodie. Kashmiri pulao was decent though it was supposed to have different variety of fruits & nuts.Nuts were there but fruits were only of 2 varieties but the best part it was not sweetish like most of the other outlets & hence doesn't monotony the taste buds.Mutton chnap as usual tasted like any cult classic mughlai dish. Kulfi was average.That made us conclude the dinner on a happy note. I always find this restaurant very pocket friendly & they serve decent portion as well. Bon apetit.

Went to Nizam's after a looooong time.  Last time i went during Roza 4-5 years back... and had awesome food, but now the food is abysmal. No taste in Biryani, the Biryani chicken was dry and chaap had absolutely no taste especially comparing to aminia is was awful.  The rogan josh was a bit better but still had something missing. The firm I was awesome... I will say.

Well Nizam - naam toh suna hi hoga as this place is the abode of the legendary kathi rolls 
The very aroma of the meat when you pass by nizam makes your tummy crave for those delicious offerings by the restaurant. They have a separate division for beef items known as the mughal garden and have heard that their beef items are equally drool worthy 
Nizams is not an air conditioned restaurant and also the fans are positioned weirdly . This is the only thing which withdraws customers who seek comfort while dining out in the city 
But the quality of the food overshadowes all this and gives an awesome dining experience to your tummy :-)

The biryani and fish fry is as good and so is the firni. Service and decor is ok and I do not complain when the food is this amazing.

Nizam's, the name which gifted the city it's legendary Kathi rolls, continues to dole out some amazing, cholesterol inducing, drool-worthy rolls. 

Now they have a separate section serving beef called the Mughal Garden. I love their kebabs, and the beef bhuna too. 

Nizam's rolls often overshadow its equally delectable Firni, but it's definitely one of the best in town.

Visited this place many times especially for nizam's roll. Quantity of meat in a chicken/mutton roll is less unless you order double mutton/double chicken roll. Otherwise taste is good and totally different from other famous roll centres like hot kathi roll or kusum's roll. They also make wonderful roti, naan, kabab and phirni. Rotis are soft,kebabs are tender and phirni is just outstanding. Very very pocket-friendly.

Nizam's has been a favourite to me for a long time. I visited this place in multiple occasions. Especially the Mughal Garden part (which serves beef) attracts me most.
Last time I tried beef biryani with beef kebab. Biryani was fantastic as usual. So was the kebab with a musky flavour of charcoal. I must say that beef was very well cooked and I am a bit critical about this. I also ordered paratha and these were pretty big in size. Dessert was kulfi and it was nice too.
The service here is quick and you will be served steaming food. No doubt in that. Also very pocket friendly. Highly recommended to all my fellow Mughal food admirers. (They also have a separate non beef segment just beside it)

Well here you can get good quality of food at quite cheap prices but don't expect a good ambience. This is not an AC Restaurant but this place falls under the legendary restaurants so I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. Coming to the food, I ordered Chicken Katti Roll for which they are specially known. The roll was a quite a delicious one and I recommend to try this.

On a crowdy sunday when people were busy with their shopping for eid,we friends decided to have some pet puja at moghul garden(beef section of nizam). This is situated just beside the main nizam restaurant. The sitting area is adequate enough.

We quickly ordered the following:-

1. Chicken biriyani- A friend of mine had taken this. Normal portion of biriyani served with aloo & 1 pc of chicken. The quantity was normal & i had a little taste of it but didn't quite like it to be honest.

2. Paratha- They served some great parathas. Very big & round in shape as well as low on oil content. Liked it very much. 1pc of paratha should be enough for a person.

3. Beef kebab- Small pieces of beef meat fried in masala & onion. The meat was tender & was nicely cooked although i felt the seasoning was a bit underdone which didn't quite enhance the meat's taste.

4. Firni- Less sweet than firnis found in other places but the texture of the firni was awkward to me as i thought it wasn't quite set as it should. It was okayish.

5. Mutton roll- Big in size & the paratha was light & not heavy. The filling of the roll was good as well. Mutton was fresh & tender.

Nizam being a heritage offers you food at economical prices but maybe tastewise it has deteorated very much. The service deserves special mention as our order was served very quickly. Happy eating!!

Nizam is a brand in kolkata for kathi rolls, a benchmark to be more appropriate. This is been in kolkata for years and have been ruling the market since then. The juicy chunks of spicy chicken and crisp parantha are to die for couple. Apart from rolls their biryani and chicken bharta is too good. Bharta is so creamy, and chicken is nicely shredded along wit the garnish of egg slices. Love to visit this place whenever i go to new market.

Best Kathi roll ever had. The charcoal heated grill imparts the authentic flavors to the chicken and the marinade with the chicken roasts in a slow flame which not only makes it succulent but also a lovable delight. Though it it is always crowded but then also the service is quite print. A must try is the Kathi roll.

Whenever i go for shopping at new market area i make sure to give a visit at nizam's. Its famous for its khati rolls. I always order the egg chicken roll with extra crispy. They will give the actual shikh chicken kababs in the rolls not just an ordinary gravy chicken. The roll tastes awesome. The biriyani is upto the mark. I sometime try the kulfi over there which is also good. Once i had haleem over there during ramzaan itz not that good.

One of those places in Kolkata, which you can find in everyone's restaurant dictionary. A place serving some lovely food over years and making people happy with their dishes. If you are in a mood of going to a place with a great ambience and beautiful decor you can always have the option to search zomato but if you would like to have some great food without bothering about anything else, this is your place. Located in the Hogg Market area in Esplanade you wont have much of a problem to find this place as anyone in that place can help you with the directions. The staffs are efficient and serves you quite fast. Don't expect smile or friendly behaviour though.
Things you can order is:
#Rolls: Just too good. Great Taste, great variety. Unlimited options to choose.
#Biryani: A good choice here.
#Chicken Kebabs: Try out this for sure.
#Chicken Rezzala: You would love this.

The price tag is low and wont give much pressure on your pocket. A definite option to have some tasty food if you are in New Market Area.

I had the first kebab here when i was a child and till then i have been a great fan of their chicken tengri kebab,fish kebab(bekti), chicket boti kebab and also their chicken kathi roll. I almost had all their kebabs as i am a huge kebab lover but these are my favourites. Their biryani is just awesome but a bit overspiced for my liking.But the ambience is too clumpsy and tandoori aroma is all over the place. All in all food is good but as a food joint with seating i wouldnt prefer it.

heard a long time back in my childhood from my dad about the heritage roll n kebabs food of this place .. ist tym I have been there hopefully I was in 8th standard. THE NIZAM SPECIAL CHICKEN ROLL the ist item I have tried with my¬†¬† family while shopping in new market area. its cheap and delicious. from that tym became a frequent visitor to hang out with friends. the mutton gravy items and mutton biryani is too tasty in this place. the palce is not having AC so as ambiance U may not find that much comfortable but the food is superb. most of mughlai dishes are more than I expected.

LATER in ist year of college I have explored¬† for beef dishes and this place never¬† dissappointed me. believe me BEEF BIRYANI, beef quorma, beef china are awesome in this place. for mughlai food lovers specially¬† the biryani lover and most specially the beef explorers should give it a try. 

and dont get confused or scared(who r not beef eaters) they have separate counter for beef place and regular mutton n mughlai items.¬† dont know about the veg food I have never tried there or dont know even they have a menu or not. but for a economic hang out this place is a cool choice.

Pretty disappointed, considering the fame they have. The service was decent but cleanliness was shockingly poor. The Tangdi Kabab was okayish, the biriyani was nothing special, just like the ones you would find in regular streetside restaurants and the do Piyaza was, well, weird! Frankly, won't consider visiting again.

Located just beside the Kolkata municipal corporation, If you are tired of shopping and need a place to sit , then this is the right place , Well, Nizam is specially known for its Kathi kabab Rolls, besides we tried out their biriyani ( Hyderabadi { Mutton}) ,¬† It tastes really well with dry fruit topping on the top of it and their service is really good¬† and¬† they don't charges extra, I mean the VAT and service charges . The price you see in the menu card are all inclusive of Tax.
So Why Waiting !!!

Well I had gone to the Mughal Garden, the separate part of the restaurant where they serve beef. I had the beef kebab, biryani and bhuna beef ending the meal with Firni. Overall the food quality is good. There aren't many tables for sit and dine and they are in a sharing basis, which was fine with me. Pocket pinch is cheap. Great place to go if you want to have beef. After all it's Nizam's.

One of the oldest eatery,well known for rolls and mughlai dishes..
This is my first time to nizam there are 2 outlets one for no beef and one for beef..
So we went to no beef one.. it was crowded but seats were available inside it is a big outlet but no AC. Fast service with chilled water. 
We ordered 2 egg chicken roll and chilled thumbs up ..
Roll was bit oily but taste was good fully stuffed with chicken kebeabs,egg & onion.
It was perfect because of Masala and lemon juice & of course the paratha..
I would recommend this..

The legend has it, that the when time was young in the Colonial era, when Kolkata was the epicentre of the countries politics and  beaurocracy, and people of Kolkata were scamperring to and fro from this busy office goers heartland in dhoti kurtas...the Nizam's had a dream to feed the hungry tide with a quick, affordable yet tasty food that they can have while they walk in the streets...what if the tasty kebabs can be wrapped in a paratha...and that's how probably this legendary Street food was conceived.... In all the ways the roll is a superior Street food to any other regular options...probably the most important is that you can see it being made right in front of you. You know what's going in it...that's what makes your taste buds go frenzy...that's the secret recipe no one tells you about....Genius.

Dont know why this place is so famous. Kathi roll was supposedly invented here. But the quality of rolls is pathetic. It is full of oil and the meat inside is tasteless and hard. We ordered mutton kathi kebabs but it was not mutton most probably. Avoid eating here if you do not eat beef.

Located in New Market, Nizam's has been there for ages. Their specialties are- Kathi Rolls, Biriyani and Tandoori. Overall a big outlet, but it never remains empty. Ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Tangri Butter Masala and Tandoori Chicken. The food was yummy, the service was fast and the price is reasonable as well. If food is more important than dining in a fancy place, Nizam's is the way to go. Happy Eating.

After a hot afternoon of shopping. We were just craving for food & luckily Nizam's was close by. I had come here earlier and loveddd the biryani,but wasn't on the spree of reviewing on zomato back then so it skipped.
Ambience is just okay. It's old. Don't expect much.
The biryani is top class. It's amazing.
1 plate is a little too much for a person to finish all by themselves, atleast that's what i feltüòÇ.
Nonetheless Nizams serve the best biryani in townüòä.

If you eat beef,,,, then you must have their Beef Biryani for it is simply what Nizam is famous for....... So, enjoy the meal.....

The service is quick and the ambience Is still old but pleasant. We finished up a chicken chaap with roti in minutew of reaching us, it was rich yet yum but really oily. I picked up a chicken roll which was too oily and paratha was very heavy and thicken was not very soft. A place we could  visit once in a blue moon.

As they highly regard Nizam to be the inventor's of Kathi Rolls, and right so, no one else makes a perfect roll better than Nizam. Flaky and soft parathas, juicy and succulent chicken, lemon braised thinly sliced onions, and may be some small pieces of chilly (If you wish to), all you get is a sweet happy small family living content ever after!

Located between Aminia and Hogg Market, this place is a landmark in itself. People flock from far places of this city, and even from outside to enjoy their Biryani, Kebabs and Tandoor items. Although their Biryani and other side dishes do not crack me up much, their Boti Kebab is another wonder which simply baffles me.

The interiors is nowhere near cranky. Shabby old sitting options with the always busy staffs, fine dining is not something one should expect here. However, if you wish to dive into the waves of history and be a part of the lucky souls who has dined in here, do not hesitate to drop by.

PS:- Do opt for the delicious Kulfi post your meal. Also, if you intend to have beef, visit the joint beside this one.

I had heard praises being showered upon this place for its legendary rolls and all, so I got to try the roll once out of luck. The chicken roll which I had was excellent, simply delicious and made with great care. Their roll comes at affordable cheaper prices and the one I had was not too spicy as to burn your tongue. Though I haven't tried any other item and definitely wish to in the near futute, I would surely pick Nizam's for a good dose of rolls to relish that makes you feel like a Nizam for a while as you get buried in the mesmerising experience of chomping a Nizam's roll.

Had ordered mutton biriyani, chicken tandoori, lachha paratha and mutton pasinda. Since i don't eat mutton i just had one lachha paratha with tandoori chicken. N both of these tasted okayish. My parents liked the biryani and pasinda. They liked the tandoori also.
Maybe even i wud have liked it if i hadn't build my expectations so high. 
There ambience is not good and the place seems slightly unhygienic.

This restaurant needs no introduction to the foodies of Kolkata. Most of the ppl IV talked to , already know the place, irrespective of whether they've gone there or not. 

The main reason for me to visit the place is because they serve beef. One of the few places in Kolkata where they serve good beef. Other than the taste, all other factors are downplayed here. Not much of an ambience or cleanliness or decor. Service is pretty fast thou.
IV tried the beef kababs, rolls and parata, which were all amazing. The paratas are soaked in oil thou. A rating of 3.5 is solely attributed to the taste of the food.

Nizam's located in the heart of new market is one of Kolkata's heritage restaurant. Its always bustling with shoppers. If you are squeamish or fancy then this is not the place for you. Nizam's still has the old Kolkata charm with haphazardly placed simple table-chairs, unornamented walls and less-fanciful waiters. But the staff are swift and efficient. I visited this place on a winter afternoon, while on a shopping spree at new market.

We ordered tandoori roti, mutton rezala and chicken chap. The food was delicious. The rotis were warm and soft. The gravies had a lot of excess oil, but they were out of the world. The prices were very reasonable.

Nizam's was started as early as the 1900s. It was small stall then only in the 1930s it came near the Corporation building where it stands today. 
They have partition on one side they serve beef and the other side they don't. The rolls are the specialty, the double beef egg roll is to die for. I have heard that it is so good that one can't resist having inly one roll at least two is minimum. I personally eat two and parceled 2 home. 
It's a must visit if you are a foodie.

Disappointed... Very much disappointed I am. I know Nizam's is famous for their rolls,but we were so full after having biriyani and chanp that we had to leave the urge of eating rolls for the next time. The place was not so clean.. A cat was moving in the restaurant here and there.. I found it wired really and the staffs were not so bothered about it,dnt knw why. Now comes the food..OK so we ordered a biriyani, chicken chanp...kathi kabab and firni. They served very fast.Now  the biriyani was good,but I have eaten a lot better biriyani than this really. The chanp was looking so yummy,but it tasted not good at all. I found the chicken very chewing and rubber like. Only the kathi kabab was ok.. But none of the food items was like wawoo..!! The food items did look really delicious when served, but the taste was not that good I imagined. Next time I am looking forward to try their rolls only.

I had such bad experience of this place. I don't know how it still finds it's place among legendary and good biryani collection.
Firstly, the restaurant is quite unattractive, below par than its contemporaries, with just-about-okay seating arrangement.
Coming to the food, it was BAD. I don't know, if it was like that only on the day we went, or if it's an everyday matter and people choose to rate it higher despite it, just because it is "legendary". Dada boudir biryani tastes better and they aren't pretentious.
WE ordered biryani, which was dripping oil, mutton rezala, the gravy of which was like water. I didn't bother to taste anything else after this. to top that, the people here weren't hospitable either.
Nizam used to be good. It is not any longer.

Brothers and sisters... These guys invented the chicken and mutton and it's an industry today, but Nizam's rolls are champions. I gave up beef some time back and Nizam's stopped serving beef some time back but I 'm not ashamed but sad to say I miss the kheeri rolls. I never miss the opportunity to grab a double chicken roll and pack some freshly bar b qed chicken kabab when I'm in the area.

Nice and clean place with a wide variety of food available.
Food is fresh and delivery is fast.
Restaurant is spacious enough to hold a crowd. Prices are pocket friendly and the wiaters are friendly too.
If you are tired from a long day shopping in esplanade then this can be your place to hangout.

Well maybe its my badluck as I see so many reviews that is goin ga ga about the food served here... Saw actually the ratings and decided to give it a try 4d first time....
First thing first the place wasnt so clean..... We asked 4 tandoori roti and the waiter in4md us that we can get only parathas as the tandoor is not wrkin.... Me and my friend ordered the mutton variants namely chaap and kasa... 
The paratha was oily and greasy... The kasa was too hard it didn't looked fresh at all.... The chaap was slightly better.... 
Wud not recommend this place to my friends...

Located just adjacent to the new market Aminia and opposite to the corporation building.This place is one of the oldest in Kolkata. The food they serve is okay enough.
We ordered: Mutton kati kebab, Mutton Chaap, Chicken chaap, Tandoori roti and Kulfi.
Didn't suit me dat well,
Mutton was oily, and could not be chewed.Chicken chap was also too oily but tasted good.The rotis were soft. The kulfi was creamy and cool and it was the only item for which I'm giving it a 3 rating.
This place disappointed me very much as i had expected a lot 
However,the pocket pinch is quite low which makes the visits worthwhile.

Heard a lot about Nizam's and hence visited the place to find old restaurent with few people having dinner. Layout is not that great as it seems the place has expanded over the years. Hygiene is a serious issue it seems. Floor was all dirty and seriously required a proper scrub. Tissue paper littered on the floor was too saddening a site. Ordered Mutton Rezala and tandoori roti and Kulfi. Service was quick. Gravy was great in taste, thin and one could feel the sourness of yogurt. Meat was 3" x 2" x 1" with bone. Chevon was not tender as it should have been but was OK. Tandoori Roti was 8" but kulfi was way too pathetic due to its watery base.
Hygiene - Thumbs Down, Food ( Quantity and Quality ) - Average, Cost - Average

It was Nizam's who invented Rolls, and even today it is Nizam's who makes the best Rolls in Kolkata.

If you want to understand what Art is, visit Nizam's.

Want to know how & why it is mile ahead of others? Heres the list -

1. You can actually taste the egg in egg chicken & egg mutton rolls. No, the chicken & mutton does not dominate, rather it share space with the egg.
2. Eggs are super fluffy.
3. Great chicke tikka kebab & mutton seekb kebab stuffing ( altough mutton kebabs are little dry).
4. Endless supply of green chilies & lemon.
5. They will actually make you seat & offer the rolls in plate.

Do you need anything else? Stop whatever you are doing and go to Nizam to taste the -'taste' which stands still with changing time.

One of those awesome awesome places I go for rolls whether it's the kati or the regular ones, they are the BEST...Period... The mutton rolls are my favourite and nothing else no where else comes even close. ¬†The bara kabab is nicely charred with a good overerall chunky feel, the murgh malai zafrani and the seekh is melt in the mouth.... This is paradise when it comes to food. ¬†The rest of the food is still better compared to others but ¬†I have only ones that move my body and soul

Its one of the classic restaurants of pire Indian food, from mughlais to kebabs. Went there late last night, even as we were the last customers of the day, the waiters were brilliant in going about their duties and serving us with a warm smile. We ordered tandoori nan, mutton rogan josh, chicken butter masala and tikka kebabs.
The mutton was soooo soo soft!!
The butter masala was one of the best, i have ever had!!
However the kebabs werent that good. They were hard and anything but juicy.
This place might be a low on aesthetics but id top notch on fulfilling a hungry man's appetite with north indian delicacies.

I went there today for a late lunch, and was quite confused with what I wanted to have. When in doubt, go with the traditional stuff, I say. Thus, laccha paratha and chicken chaap was the afternoon fare today. It was a trainload of flavours. Both familiar, and surprisingly new ones. The parathas were thick and oil laden. The chaap was pure goodness. This also happens to be where the Kolkata kathi roll was invented, and so how about a double mutton, double chicken roll to top it all off, I thought, and to the waiter's gaping surprise, I ordered one, after finishing the chaap paratha meal. And then there was pure bliss. Then there was no dinner.

Nizam's of the Hogg Market, Park Street is one of my fav place, specially for the beef items. Truly speaking I ate my first beef roll here with my friends back at 2007. I am an occasional but regular visitor here. Their beef biriyani is good in softness of the beef as well as with the smell. In the festival time of Muslims they serve Halim which really yummy. Ambience 3/5 but food is 4/5. Service may get delayed in the rush hours, otherwise it's a nice place.

Iconic place,no doubt. The rolls are quite good...especially the parathas they use are delightfully crisp.
However,I did not like their biryani much. Their service is laid-back,I had to ask them repeatedly to take my order. The place becomes very crowded at times.
The ambience is typical,without any frills as such. However,the pocket pinch is quite low which makes these visits worthwhile.

Located in the crowdy and bustling area of New Market, just opposite Chaplin Square this place is not that hard to locate. Its a pretty old restuarant. When asked the waiter recommended Nargis Biryani on the menu. Minutes later a plate of Biryani was served to my table. Just that it looked different. Garnished with dry fruits like dates and fruits like cherries,carrots etc chopped,this Biryani fills your mouth with a perfectly sweet taste. The two chunks of spiced chicken,the potatoes and the rice won the war against the ravenous Hunger in my tummy. But yes since its a bit dry and has a sweet flavour I'd rather you order something realy spicy with it else it might feel way too sweet.
Amount- Sufficient for two people
P.S - Pocket friendly.
Ambience- Okayish.

Its another legendary place amongst food joints....if it was not for nizams then the world would not have got this quick bite food called "Roll" and it is Calcutta's favourite quick bite now...you'll find a roll shop in every corner of this city but non can be compared to nizams though...nizams roll is truly legendary... They've not only invented it, they've pioneered in making it too...I just love the chicken roll at nizams... There are many good roll shops in Calcutta but not a replacement for nizams taste.... My rating is only for their roll...if u plan to sit and eat then try their nizam special chicken kathi kebab and paratha...their kathi kebab is another legendary item...its the same kebab they use for their rolls...

This maybe a legendary restaurant and stuff but I was disappointed with the quality I got. Their famous rolls didn't taste as good as some people say, the biryani was nowhere close to being compared with an Arsalan or Royal. I expected a bit more from this restaurant and went with high expectations and probably because of that was left a tad bit disappointed.

I Love this place. I am a biryani lover.. It is painful to experience the deterioration in quality in some of the renowned joints. I ordered simple Mutton Biryani 2 plates and one plate salad.. The biryani was light with less of dalda very aromatic spices blended into long grain rice. The mutton piece was soft and melted in the mouth.¬†
The best part was that the bill came to Just Rs320/-.¬†
The seating might not be top class or the place might be noisy.. But..Nizams is the winner in the overall experience and value for money.

This place is legendary for it's rolls. And it still lives upto that reputation. While the fillings are less, one shouldn't complain given the price. The flavours are outstanding but I would have really loved a lot more chicken. :(

On top of an awesome chicken roll, I shall also swear by the fact that Nizam's serves the best phirni in town. It's thick creaminess and perfect sweetness can woo even the perfect cynic.

Final recommendation: Awesome phirni but too less fillings in the awesome chicken roll!!

Would prefer giving 3.5 instead of 4.5 out of 5 because of few things which I would like to share frankly. I don't know whether anyone has figured out what I found in their Biryani as I ordered Mutton Special Biryani with Onion Salad.. The amount of Biryani Essence ( Meetha Aatar ) is sprinkled over its normal amount probably because I freaked out their smell which was too bold as it tasted a bit awkward and bitter in taste. Their Mutton was okay but needs to be more soft and tender as well as they have look after this issue seriously because it ruins the energy of eating Biryani.....!!!!!

Their rolls are tasty. The biriyani is well cooked and the quantity is quite good!
Love their naan and chicken ain course side dishes too.

And the best thing in the item?
The kababs ofcourse!!
They are all delicious, topping my list is the Chicken Reshmi Kabab.

The service is prompt . The place is clean. Setting is modest.
All in all; great food and amazing worth of money.

The name of this restaurant is something almost every Kolkatan is well aware of!!! Located at Hogg Street of New Market area, this place serves mouth watering dishes since ages, happens to be one of the oldest food joint in Kolkata.
Had visited this place and I'm pretty much satisfied with the taste and quality of food they serve. The ambience is average though and the service staffs are just okay in delivering services, the restaurant deserves a standing ovation for the amazingly awesome food they serve.
In fact its that legendary restaurant, who discovered the concept of ROLL, the very popular fast food item that is available all over India today(many people are not aware of this fact).
Should have given a 5 rating if the ambience and quality of service was as good as the food served here.
A legendary restaurant anyway, and obviously worth visiting.

Nizams is just the right place to hop in after a tiring session of shopping at New Market or Sreeram Arcade. Although famous for its biryani, the place offers a wide range of foods. Being a biryani lover me and my friend ordered chicken biryani along with chicken reshmi kebab. The kebabs were well cooked and the biryani was also good in taste. Sorrounded by rivals, I must say Nizams kept its standard up to the mark. And brownie points for 'no taxes.'

While casually roaming in the Esplanade area , we decided to hop into this place for some evening snacks which latter turned out to be a complete dinner .
From my friend i came to know that this place is famous for its Rolls . So if a place is famous for some thing then its a must try .
I ordered mutton roll, chicken tandoori , mutton seekh , Panner butter masala , chicken butter masala and tandoori roti .
The roll , tandoori and seekh kebabs were very delicious and the tandoori roti was very soft and baked till perfection.I felt that the chicken butter masala was little oily I mean much oily were added than requirement.
Else apart from this everything was perfect.
One con is on the hygiene part , they can keep the dinning area much clean .

When it comes to rolls be it beef, chicken, potato or paneer, nizam is the first place that comes to my mind. The rolls are perfect in terms of size and proportion and can fulfil a hungry stomach. Nizam rolls are also perfectly made with the perfect aroma and spices on order not to make it too spicy and the meat is tender and juicy. One tip... Enjoy the roll as it is and do not give specifications. The end of the meal has to be with the phirnee which is possibly one of the best phirnees in the town. The place is dingy and gives an old and rustic feel and also very pocket friendly.

This is not the first time I have been to this place nor the last time. Its one of the absolute favourite places and the ratings really dont matter to them.
Coming to the food , we ordered a mutton kathi kabab ,which was the showstopper of all the dishes we ordered. The chicken reshmi kabab and the mutton kadai fulfilled all the senses as it passed the tongue.
I wish the meat both chicken and mutton would have been more tender.

We are too small to criticize this place because it's an age old restaurant. It has to separate parts one serves beef and other one don't. You can't expect a good ambiance and hygiene in this place. But still it will not disappoint you I'm sure. Test of foods is too good. You could have to wait to get a table here because its always over crowded by foodies. Definitely recommended for everyone.

It's Eastern India's Nizam when it comes to Mughlai food. It was also the originator of Kathi Rolls which we Calcuttans swear by. Visited there on 30th Dec to lay my hands on the delicious Kebabs & Rolls. The taste remains heavenly till date. I happened to bounce into Mr. Suhel Seth, the famous columnist & social celebrity. It proves the restaurant's fame...

A few days ago i went to Nizam's with friends. First there were no seats available.. we shared one table.. the staffs were helpful. We ordered chickn kathi kebab, chicken biriyani, tandoori roti and reshmi butter chkn. The reshmi butter masala was not that much tasty and the roti was also a little bit cold. The biriyani was good enough. The kathi kebab was also good. The service was also good.

The best and cheapset place in the city to have Biriyani and kebabs. The hot kati rolls are also yum. I always recommend it over any other Moglai resto in the city. Price is dirt cheap. Service is prompt. Well mannered staff. No air conditioning so that's a minus but it keeps the prices in check. Please try it. You'll love it. Beef lovers can get in to the adjacent Mogul Gardens resto. This ones for the Tues Thurs Sat people. A landmark of the city. Turn over the menu and read it for some interesting tidbits. The wait for your order will be much shorter.

As other foodies always tell you, this Nizam's is known for Mughlai cuisine; more specifically, kathi rolls. Take a bite and you know exactly what makes this place is so famous.
I recently noticed that their CHICKEN BHARTA is great, and the CHICKEN BIRYANI which we had ordered was brilliant. Over the years the quantity of the biryani has lessened, but the taste has remained : heavenly. In contrast with most of the biryani biggies in the city, Nizam's prepares its biryani such that it is really moist unlike the dry variant served elsewhere.
The CHICKEN TANDOORI served was decent, but the mint chutney wasn't really a good one. The awesome PHIRNI was a grand way to end the meal.
UPDATE : The Nargisi Biryani (with two chicken pieces) is served with cherries, raisins, peas and diced carrots sprinkled on top of the biryani. Inform them if you wish to avoid the toppings. :P

Despite the lack of a good ambience and inadequate fans inside the restaurant, their awesome food combined with super-fast service and decent staff made me pretty satisfied. Thumbs up for the comparatively low prices as well.

Four stars from me!

Another trip down memory lane at the joint where the kathi roll journey started many years back. Back in the day we used to end up here on weekends post 10 pm for their delicious rolls and biryani.

On a shopping trip in New Market, we decided on a whim to savour the roll experience here. Tried the mutton and chicken rolls and can safely say that the experience is still that awesome although the size of the rolls could do with slight improvement.

Cheers,

Food wise, it was okay. I somehow didn't get the great feel of being the famous nizam's. Anyway, the food was moderate. The halim was good though. But the major let down was the billing. They had charged us extra for something we hadn't even eaten. And when we brought it to the notice of the management, the waiters first claimed we had eaten it, and then they still kept on refusing. Later we came to know that some customers before had not paid their bill, and they were trying to make us pay for it. So overall not a experience I want to repeat again. Ever. I took off .5 for the whole bill issue. Otherwise it's a 3.

Wanted to go and take my wife to this legendary eatery to have egg rolls. We ordered double egg roll, egg curry and jeera rice. However, the roll and egg curry were nothing great and i have had better both elsewhere. It was good for nostalgia, the service was very nice, the place was clean, but again food was nothing great.

Kolkata Street Food hopping isn‚Äôt complete without visiting the chain of restaurants in New Market area. The famous Kathi Rolls, the delicious stuffing wrapped in Roti that is now found in every city is said to have got its life in Nizam‚Äôs Restaurant on Hogg Street in New Market, Kolkata. Though there have been many variations in the Kathi Rolls served in various cities, the original and authentic Kathi Rolls is ubiquitous in Kolkata. My friend suggested me to definitely drop by Nizam‚Äôs for some lip smacking rolls. 

Ambience was pretty Okayish. I ordered a Double paratha Double Chicken Roll. Fried paratha was packed well with beaten egg, spicy minced chicken, onions and chilies rolled up and served like an Indianized Burrito version. Further, they serve no separate sauce(s) unlike other restaurants as everything is well packed during preparation itself. Yet, the Rolls are amazingly delicious and droolworthy! 

New Market is a haven for delicious Kolkata food and Nizam‚Äôs is a Legendary addition to it. Highly Recommended :)
Happy Eating :)

A completely overhyped place which doesn't deserve such word of mouth appreciations. I must say that people who still recommend this place must try a small roadside stall in few places of kolkata who serve better rolls anyday. As I was in the New market area for some christmas shopping , we decided to try out this place for some Rolls. We ordered  a double egg double mutton roll and 2 double chicken rolls. Firstly the mutton in the roll was hard enough to throw and break someones head. Secondly the parantha they used to make the roll was crispy like a papad. Thirdly they might have used 2/3 days old Dalda to fry the roll which gave it a very pungent odour. 
While on out way out we peeped into the kitchen, and for a surprise if u have a look at the way they make the rolls, I guess u wont come back here again for a meal. Never going back here again. Pathetic food quality. For people who want to have good rolls , please try the small time shops outside- they make much better roll than these people.

Since childhood my dad praised this place for its roll and kebab. So I visited kolkata and made sure I visit this place. So the ambience was average and honestly I had not much expectation there. Then I ordered a chicken egg role which was honestly average and not something to go ga ga about. So I then tried a chicken kebab and it was just pathetic. On that when I called the guy who served me he was bloody rude. So nizam thanks but I do not wish to return again.

Nizam's is a legendary restaurant located near Hogg market. I have heard huge praises of their rolls and kababs but never had the pleasure of going there.

But today my friend suggested to meet me at esplanade and the idea of visiting this place struck my head.

It was around 6:30 pm when we came here. Though there is huge seating space, yet all the tables were occupied except one and we were lucky enough to get seated there. The interiors are quite clean and the ambience is good. We could see the kababs being grilled from our tables and we craved to have them. Though most of the people were having rolls, we decide to have kababs only. Our order was chicken Kathi kabab and chicken shammi kabab

First came the Kathi kabab. Four sticks of kabab were presented on our table. It was insanely good. The chicken pieces were grilled to perfection and just melted in the mouth. Then I realized why nizam is so famous for their Kathi kababs.

Then came the shammi kabab. It was more like chicken cutlet. The filling was of finely minced chicken and served with chips and salad. It was good and spicy.

To give our meal a sweet end, we ordered a kulfi. It was good and of the better kulfis I had till date.

Overall this place is not great in terms of ambience or hospitality but what will bring u back here again and again is the great food served at highly affordable prices!

The best place for Kolkata rolls hands down! 

Just a classic double egg roll is the best option

I've had other good rolls in Kolkata .. But I don't know what they do but their taste is exceptional 

It's a bit of a task to get there but it's totally worth it 

For those of you who want to try something unconventional- try the "double double double" which is Double egg, Double parantha, Double chicken.

By far, the best makers of Biriyanis in the City. This shop has been making Biriyanis, the other shops in Calcutta can only imagine of.
Their rolls are also good (called Kathi Rolls, which they have a claim to the invention of),but nothing beats the Nargisi Boroyani, adrift with chunks of yummy Nargisi koftas and dry fruits.

Ten stars on five stars for this one..

This is not my first time here,I have been here for many times but I thought of writing a review. Anyways we friends visited to have some authentic foods.
The place will be always full of people and you can hear the outside crowd. Don't expect it to be decorated like the other posh restaurants but a simple one.
We ordered for hyderabad biryani,  butter naan, mutton keema,  chicken reshmi kebab, chicken malai curry and for dessert kulfi and firni.   
No doubt about the taste. All were cooked as it should be. We relished our lunch and was very happy after having such delicious dishes.

Had very high expectations from this restaurant. This was the first time i was visiting this place. We wanted to order rolls but then thought about going for a proper meal. We ordered for mutton biriyani, Nizam special mutton kebab and mutton kasha. The biriyani was disappointing to say the least. Even the potato was not boiled properly. Mutton was dry and could not be chewed...it was so rubbery in texture. The kebab was horrible. There was bits and pieces of mutton with lots of onions and green chilli!!!! The mutton kasha was still better with a rich gravy full of oil and spices. The restaurant was full on a weekday afternoon so I think they are not bothered about the quality anymore. The ambiance has nothing to talk about.

There is nothing much to say than to quietly go there order the kathi rolls and enjoy the delicacy. Yes otherwise humble roll here is a delicacy. Absolutely fantastic.. I would recommend Double Egg Double Chicken/Mutton roll. 

Go for fish tikka. 
Kukfi and firni are great too.
Pocket frndly is also another big plus.

Well well well ! The oldest place in Calcutta from where the famous kati rolls was born or one can say it a street side roll as well.. Situated in such a location which stays crowded 365 days a year.
It has 2 sections mainly beef and non-beef.. the beef section is als known as Mughal Garden..
I had from both of it but being a beef lover myself i have from d beef section only most of the time i visit the place.. Have been having in this place for quiet a long time now.. Whenever i go New Market i have from here..
Lets now come to the food..
.
Nizam's is famous for their rolls.. but the other dishes are equally delicious as well.
I personally like the Biryani here, may it be beef biryani, mutton biryani or chicken biryani. They even serve only egg biryani as well.
In side dish the chaap is a bit different, not of the types found elsewhere..
The rezala is quit good but excessive oily.
The bhuna is good.
Best things wch i like is their Kebabs.. they are not exactly the conventional ones.. In Nizam's the just dont grill d kebabs but they fry it with onions dn they serve which make them more tasty..
Firni is ok ok types..
So if you are a Mughlai food lover they go ahead and try it out.. :)

Beef roll, beef kathi kebab, beef biriyani and chicken butter masala - good food at reasonable price. Quite spacious and prompt response and one of the best places to have beef at.¬†If you are a diet-freak don't come here. It's a foodie hub.

Well didn't tried biriyani yet from this place but beef roll and kathi kabab and was amazing 
Beef kathi was also good but they served it cold 
The worst part of the restaurant was the behavior of the waiters

Have had their famous kati rolls. Its amazing how just kababs can do the magic without the use of any sauce or other spices. It's not too oily as well. The kulfi available here is just about okay.

This has been my favorite roll place since childhood. Nizam's in new market area needs no introduction in Kolkata. Had been planning a trip to this legendary restaurant since i booked my tickets for the city of joy. But on my recent visit I was nothing but disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered egg roll, chicken egg roll, chicken chap, roti, kulfi falooda and firni. The rolls were too oily and lacked the taste. The roti was hard and seemed to be previously prepared. The chap was also not good. The only thing that we liked was the kulfi falooda and the phirni. The bill was close to 400.

This will be a very short review, since I went there just for the rolls. They claim to be the inventor of the great Calcutta Kathi Roll.
The roll which we were served did live up to its name. Long, thick, fluffy paratha and decent chicken pieces.
The staff is also age old like the place and courteous.
Would need to go back and find out more about this place.
Till then,
Ambiance 3/5 (there is hardly any)
Quality 3.5/5 (on the roll)
Quantity 3.5/5 (decent size)
Cost 4/5 (economical)

I went here to grab a quick bite while waiting for a colleague in the new market area. It was around 11am & it was empty. Ordered a couple of rolls & was left disappointed. They were very greasy & were imbued with too much lemon for my liking. I guess it's not really a place for vegetarians at all. :-/

Our hungry stomachs after a failed attempt at trying to pandal-hop North Kolkata on Tritiya afternoon brought us here, to this time-tested hub of Mughlai cuisine. 
Even though the place covers a huge area and there are numerous tables, we had to wait for a long time, thus re-affirming the popularity of this place.
Though, the place is famous for its Biryani, we were not in the mood for it so two of my friends ordered Butter Tandoori rotis with Mutton pasinda, another friend ordered Plain Tandoori Rotis with Chicken tengri Butter masala and I ordered Mutton Korma with steamed rice (please don't judge me for the choice, the baangali in me was craving shada-bhaat ;) )
The mutton korma was swimming in a fragrant (albeit oily) gravy with a tomato half and half a boiled egg, the tomato was quite raw but the mutton was the perfect result of hours of slow-cooking as the meat was just falling off the bones.
Both the mutton pasinda (with shredded mutton pieces in a rich gravy flavoured with coriander leaves) and Chicken tengri butter masala(with two pieces of nicely char-grilled chicken legs in a spicy, buttery gravy) eere tasty and was a perfect accompaniment to the freshly prepared rotis, just out of the Tandoor.
Also, as we were quite full, we did not order any dessert but I would recommend my friends on zomato to round off their meal on a sweet note with an eathern 'kulhar' of saffron-infused Firni.

Today we parceled food from Nizam's. It is located beside aminia restaurant at esplanade. It is a very well known mughlai food hub of kolkata. Its counter is always crowded for all the yummy rolls. We parceled
Mutton Qorma- the mutton PCs were soft and well cooked, the gravy was on the lighter side which is nice in taste
Tengri Butter Masala- it was really good
Lachha Paratha- it was crispy
Firni- Good..
Overall nice experience...

A few friends got together for a shopping spree in New Market and started craving beef like crazy. So we headed straight to Nizam's 'cause, where else?

To be clear, you apparently don't get beef in the new Nizam's, but in the old one beside it, the one titled Moghul Gardens.

Ambiance is nothing to write home about. You don't visit Nizam's for the ambiance. You come here for the food. And the slight old-world charm lingering around, which I love.

After the three of us had settled down, we first ordered some parathas, a plate of Chicken Kathi Kebabs, and a plate of Beef Bhuna. The parathas were nice, crispily fried, and not overtly oily. The kebabs seemed pretty average to me, but my friends really liked them. But what  made us foodgasm was the beef bhuna. Never had I tasted softer beef before. Never. It was perfection floating in gravy, really. :D Then we made the mistake of ordering two plates of Chicken Chaap with it 'cause the bhuna was over in matter of minutes. And after the bhuna they tasted like blah. Just undercooked meat floating in oil.

So the bill came to around 500, I think. For three people, that's as cheap as it can get. Can't wait to go back for their legendary rolls!

Nizam's is the inventor of kati kebab roll and is one of the oldest mughlai resturant of the city. Since 1932 they are serving the best rolls. Overall appearence and the surrounding is not impressive but u will surely love the food. I have not tried any other dishes of nizam's yet so I cannot say anything about them but the rolls are delicious and according to me chicken roll is the best...the soft bread with good amount of chicken kati kebabs! This rating given by me is only for the rolls.
***********************
I went there for lunch with my friend and had Mutton Biryani and chicken roll. I was utterly disappointed. I just have nothing to say. It was terribly bad. The quality of rolls have also decreased. I had to decrese the rating as well.

The hygiene of this place might bother some but the food is to die for. Chicken bharta and tandoori roti is what I had and it was delicious. The kathi rolls are a huge hit at this place. You can drop in at this place without a second thought if you want good Mughlai food.

Once upon a time British loves to ate Indian Kathi Kababs, but as it used to made their hand dirty they started to wrap those Kababs into a Paratha or Roti to have them. From that Nizam's actually invented their Kathi Rolls, that is the thing many people know this New Market located Restaurant for. They not only offer rolls they are having a huge menu card too. Place inside of the restaurant is more than enough that comfortably handles few hungry people's groups. The place is well maintained, neat & clean, hygienic in every angle. The stuffs are well behaviour will make you feel comfortable too. Prices of foods are affordable too.

Coming to the foods : Rather than only Kathi Rolls I had visited this place so many times & tasted so many items but I would love to stuck on their Kathi Rolls. Their Rolls are made with a thick Laccha Paratha that is well fried & crispier enough to make you feel love it. Chicken & Mutton Kabab pieces inside of that roll is very soft & with well balanced spices. Unlike others their rolls doesn't filled with so much of sauce inside that would made other things tastes not visible. Their Biriyani on the other hand is very lite, well cooked but nothing special to be mentioned. But their Tikia kind of dishes are very salty & kind of wash out any other tastes. Tandoori roti & butter nuns are pleaser to have over here.

Conclusion : Their Kathi Rolls are well famous, but I can't say they make the best rolls out their. Probably Asha, Aminia, Lazeez are on the same ring. Still if you are in New Market area then it definitely deserve a try. I will recommend this more than Aminia or Alibaba at the same place.

Don't know about how the food quality was previously but it was extremely disappointing for me. I heard about the lovely mugalian delights and went only to be proved wrong. The food quality is extremely bad except the kabab and the roll, though the quantity was good. Add to that bad behavior of the waiters. They are extremely non co-operative and will be always on your nerves and the end will ask for a good tip. The ambiance is what it is in the central business district of a metropolitan city. On the whole i'll not recommend anyone visiting this place.

I went in for a quick snack after the day's shopping at the new market. 
The eatery is not air conditioned and the ambience is noisy but the waiters are courteous. 
We ordered a chicken biryani, chicken peshawari kebabs with tandoori rotis and a kulfi.
The biryani was with the least amount of oil possible in a biryani. In fact, I have never tasted such a oil less biryani. The rice was cooked properly. The chicken in it was juicy, spicy and tender. I didn't feel the typical heaviness which one generally feels after having a biryani. It was delicious.
The peshawari kebabs were crispy and soft served with a chutney and some salad. They were yummy.
The rotis were soft and didn't taste of sodium bicarbonate.
The kulfi was creamy and cool.

This is one of those iconic yet low-profile places that makes you nostalgic about your city/town. This was the first restaurant I went to bunking classes during high school.

The quality of food has deteriorated over the years. But it is still one of my favorite places. Nizam's still is one of the better Biryani places in town. Add to that the chicken roll and beef kabab roll to their list of awesome food.

This is also a place for observing people. This is an old place and a lot of elderly people show up out of nostalgia. This is a place for food at reasonable price - and hence you will see young professionals and students. This is in the heart of the city's shopping area - and so you will see people from walks in life.

You may just sit here with a cup of tea and observe people all day long!

One of the oldest in town and the food they serve are so tasty. The rolls are typical to them as such delicious rolls at such cheap prices are something you wouldn't find anywhere else in the city. The atmosphere might not be appreciable but the food available is sure to compensate for the shortage of an outstanding ambience.
The inventors of kathi rolls as it is found written at many places in and around the restaurant. The rolls are amazing with soft parathas and super delicious inputs given. I had ordered chicken roll and the chicken inside was very spicy and you would crave for it after having it once. They weren't normal chicken pieces,they were small chicken kebabs. Never had such chicken in a chicken roll. I prefer crispier parathas and hence wasn't much impressed by the soft parathas they had although the chicken was so tasty that it predominated over the soft parathas. Though it is a non-ac restaurant it is very well maintained and spacious with enough ventilation. Very impressed by their service and would definitely pay another visit.

Okay lets keep this thing short for i have only tried their rolls. Yes, i know its a wierd thing as i love mughlai cuisine i should have tried their biriyanis and stuff but i never had the time or oppurtunity to try out their dishes. Now coming to the point.

We all know where nizam is located so no elabortion is needed.

Ambiance is just like any age old mughlai place so no extra talks are needed.

Now coming to the rolls. I can vouch one thing they serve extra ordinary kathi rolls. I can't say they are best or not cz i am yet to try the other shops selling kathi rolls. But yeah , they are awesome in their rolls. Right from the paarathas to the stufifng to the kathi kebabs to the slight tinge of lemon in the roll make it just awesome. Loved it. !!

Highly recommended.

New Market is incomplete without Nizam's rolls and everyone who has grown up in Calcutta can vouch for that. I'd prefer to not sit in and eat because the ambiance doesn't exactly boast of anything. I would order my roll, drink a glass of masala coke from the man who mans a little stall nearby, take my roll and walk away. And yes, from Nizam's I always order the Paneer Rolls. They really make the best paneer rolls in the city - and this is coming from a hardcore carnivore. The chickens and muttons are all good, but give their paneer rolls (with a dash of lemon) a try too!

During my last few days in Kolkata I decided to visit all the places listed under Legendary Restaurants.
I have been to Nizam like a million times before I was on Zomato, so let me just me just write about my latest venture.
Best Rolls in Kolkata...Hands down best Egg chicken Roll I have ever tasted.
The crust was oily to taste but no to touch. There was a thin spread of mashed potatoes with special garnish that I just couldn't place.
The Chicken was plentiful, and juicy and chewy. Some restaurants go in putting semi cooked blobs of chicken which totally ruin the roll but Nizam aces it.
Hoping to again come back and taste the dishes.:)

One of the best place to try Kolkata ka Roll. Can't help you if you're Vegetarian. I have always opted for Chicken-Egg roll, or Mutton-Egg roll. My moto is an roll in not a roll if it does not have egg in it. Feel free to check other items also. Grab a double egg roll for a quick bite for heaven to your taste buds. Ambiance is very simple, nothing classy. Located at north eastern end of new market area. Not much hard to find.

Update 02 Nov'15: Went back for a quick bite of Egg-Chicken Roll while shopping at New Market area. The place is changed yet the food is same. Take away counter was quick and helpful to choose from menu-card, order, pay & enjoy good roll. Pictures added.

All I had was 4 hours and the onus of everything I could take away from my first visit to Kolkata was on the food as that was all I had time for. I was suggested Nizams by a friend  whose claim was and I quote "tum dilli waale Karims bhul jaoge".  
So I went to the place and the historic reputation of the place was totally justified.  Apart from the standard favourites Being a beef junkie I order a beef curry and Nizams spl paratha. The soft and succulent meat was a treat along with the parathas. To top it of phirni to wash it down was the cherry on top of the cake. 
Signing it off on a stamp paper I must say I did take away an delicious chunk away from Kolkata and am already eager to repeat it again.

I generally drop in to have lachcha paratha and mutton kassa, which is my tried and tested choice. They never disappoint. Last time I visited, had nizam's paratha and mutton dum handi. I was a bit sceptical initially, but they were equally good. Service is always quick. I do miss the ac as the food makes me perspire sometimes. But not enough to give it a miss.

This is one of my favourite Mughlai Restaurant and I come here frequently. Though they are famous for their Kathi-kebab rolls and Kulfi, you should also try their biriyani.

it is a great place for non veg people. But they also have veg dishes. I ordered veg roll. i liked it. there was just one small problem for me that, i am habituated to eat any roll which contains tomato ketchup. but the roll they served does not contained any ketchup. and as it is famous for its kabab and other meat preparation so it has smell of meat all over the place. else it is a good place.

After a month and half's gap, today went to Nizam's with family. Heard a lot about this place so thought of trying out once. I was damn hungry even ;) . The aroma of meat, I got at the entrance of the restaurant, was quite tempting. I couldn't wait any longer. Without wasting much time on the menu list, I ordered kathi roll in starters, mutton biryani, tandoori naan, Chicken qurma would go well with it so that. And chicken bharta in the end. Though we took a lot of time to have our food, but no wonder, it had tasted quite good, especially the kathi rolls and chicken qurma with tandoori naan. Would visit again for kathi rolls. In love with 'em :')

Bengalis just love heart attacks hence pure dalda made food are their favourite. And This place is the pioneer in "pure dalda made dishes" but surprisingly they are skilled enough to bring taste into it too . 
They invented kathi rolls , thus this place is a cult in kolkata for  Mughlai Food lovers. Their kababs are descent and mutton dopyaza is my favourite. If you love to get heart diseases and also love pure dalda made Mughlai food then this is the best place for you.

The kathi kabab inventors justifies there culinary excellence in making these kababs, but the rolls have less meat with respectvto its pricing, its a bit over oily and u need a carbonated soft drink to stabilise things in your stomach. Other than kathi kabab or rolls other's don't offer that great taste and there are many more alternatives available in market.

A few years back I had for the first time experienced Nizam's rolls and they were awesome but when I took my friends there a few days back I was so dissapointed. The rolls now are very ordinary, I have tasted such in road side stalls in Barrackpore. Furthermore, the service too was terrible.

PS: Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani was also ordered and that was a HUUGE disapointment. Do not go in this place for biryani. I daresay people with decent tastebuds will cringe after having their first spoonful of biryani.

Visited Nizam with lot of hopes but was very dissapointed. The kathi turned out to be very ordinary, dripping in oil unhealthy crap. I had mutton single egg roll and the mutton was so hard and chewy that i just ended up eating the roll removing all pieces. When i informed the waiter he just smiled and asked me to try chicken but refused ti replace it or not charge for it. Chicken roll was edible but just that! Again one of those overhyped places which needs an overhaul.

Nizam's just means two words to me- "Kathi Rolls". It may not be the cleanest restaurant in town and the surroundings may not be appealing, but let's face it no one can resist the smell of the meat as it waives through. Kathi Rolls and Nizam's will always be synonymous to me.

Had my first Calcutta roll here. Their rolls are great, and have just the right amount of head and flavour. Also their haleem served only during Ramazan is amazing. Their kabuli naan is soft with crunch toppings. The ambience is nothing to write home about, but the service is nice and friendly. Finding this place is not difficult, it is right in the centre of new market.

One cannot miss the the legendary Nizam's restaurant if u happen to visit the Hogg Market or more popularly known the New Market, the shopping capital in Kolkata. Nizam's were famous for their beef rolls in gone by days which has been replaced by the chicken and motton variants. The filling of the rolls are cooked in barbecues which gives it a burnt flavour and it combined with the oil dripping lachha parathas will be a guilt food for the diet conscious people. Food wise, the nagis biriyani or tum tum biriyani are nice for someone with a big appetite.  Another must try is their mutton chaap. Overall a great place to indulge into ur meat cravings.

I finally walk into Nizam's ...the legendary restaurant! It's one of the oldest places to be in esplanade area. 
This place has amazing rolls. I love their double egg rolls coz it always has a hint of lemon juice in it unlike the other versions which are loaded with ketchup. I am yet to try their Biryani though.
It's a good place to grab a quick bite while shopping in the area, it's also highly pocket friendly! Glad to see that such places are still thriving around in the city!

Situated in new market area famous for kathi rolls and beef biriyani.. they have two sections side by side and one of them sell beef dishes. Having too many expectations and to have beef biriyani we went one afternoon for lunch. We ordered beef kebabs , 2 plates of beef biriyani and a plate of chicken biriyani with lime sodas. Beef was soft and well made but the biriyani was not that good as per our expectations.  Like to visit again for kathi rolls.

Nizam's happens to be one of my favourite restaurant in New Market area. The best thing about them is that the Kaathi Roll tastes the same as they used to be during my school days. Nizam's Chicken Roll always makes the shopping experience at New Market a pleasure.

Cordial waiters and super fast services are the two things which I like about this restaurant apart from its legendary food. I have mainly tasted the rolls and kebabs here. Didn't get much scope to taste the Biryani, but would love to taste that one day. Chicken Tangri Kebabs, Murg Haryali Kebabs and Mutton Seekh Kebabs will must feature in my favourite lists.

I would highly recommend it to those who don't bother about the AC seatings, classy d√©cor and super suave waiters but want to taste the best Kaathi Rolls in the city and decent Kebabs seasoned with nostalgia of the good old Calcutta.

One must visit this Restaurant once for getting a good quality food items at a reasonable rate.      I liked the Biriwani here. It has really got Mughal AROMA , the Taste is awesome .... On the other hand, I dint liked the Chicken piece of the Hariwali Kabab , it wasnt tasteful. 
The Ambience is very Noisy and not Airy . We were sweating literally while taking those Hot Biriwanis in top of that Heat. The Servicing is good enough , quite fast..... I liked that.... 
Prices are very reasonable .....

Located just beside its arch-rival Aminia, this roll and biryani joint is one of the oldest in the city. My father used to taste their food regularly in his early age. According to him, there is a heaven and hell difference in terms of quality when compared with their early years. Though I have not tasted them before 1995, still I found biryani awesome. Quick service makes me biased to them everytime I stand in between Aminia and nijam's to choose one.

My first beef roll came from Nizam's decades back.It still remains the best roll I ever had.The paratha was a little crisp and there were kababs and onion inside with vinegar and no smothering with sauce which is the norm today.

In its heyday Nizam's and Aminia were two landmarks or foodmarks which were iconic eateries in a place flooded with restaurants all around.Then the decline came and Nizam's became fragmented,there was change of ownership and is now a pale shadow of their glorious past.

I went to the beef serving section and had a beef roll followed by a chicken roll both being just about average.I saw Haleem also being served and a heavy midday crowd inside.But even with mediocrity there is a certain something which makes me want to go back again.Perhaps that's the magic of heritage.

The inventor of the famous KATHI KABAB ROLL.That is what NIZAM is famous for..Located just near Aminia,this restaurant serves the best kathi kebab in the city..This place is a must for having rolls if you are going for shopping to new market..
This restaurant has two sections one being a beef section and the other being a no beef section..To start with the ambience,its a big place having lots of place to seat..As u enter the waiter guides you to your seats and they are attentive enough to respond to ur calls immediately..
Now coming to the food,they have a wide varieties of mughlai dishes..I visited this place a lot of times and i was not at all diasppointed on any of my visits..The things that we ordered were¬†
1.Mutton Haleem
2.Nizam's Parantha
3.Mutton Biryani
4.Chicken Kathi Kabab
5.Tikia
6.Firni
7.And not to miss without which going to this place is not worth it i.e CHICKEN KATHI ROLL..

The mutton haleem had a unique taste and is garnished with fried onions and ginger and chiilis..it was served hot and fresh and the aroma will drive you crazy..in short it tasted AWESOME..
The Mutton Biryani was neither too spicy nor too light..it tasted good enough..it had the awadhi smell in it..not the best i had but still it was good enough..the mutton was succulent and cooked to perfection..
The mutton tikia tasted really good..
The chicken kathi kebab and parantha complement each other very well..they serve 4 kathis i.e around 20 kebabs fried with onions and green chillis,.again the kebabs were juicy and cooked to perfection and tasted really good,really awesome..add some lemon to get the best taste..
And last but not the least the KATHI ROLL..the roll was crispy,fried well and served with chicken,onion and lemon in it..
Overall the place is good enough to serve you some authentic mughlai dishes..
Dont miss this place especially when you are in new market for shopping..i am sure you wont be disappointed!!!

It is located right opposite the road in Elite cinemas, it's not hard to locate as well. Nizams have divided into two sections - one No Beef, and the other serves Beef. I guess for many foodies the name Nizam itself is synonymous to Kathi Rolls.¬†This is where the legendary journey of perhaps the most acclaimed fast food started. The double chicken double paratha roll was my favorite. Also, my favorite Kathi rolls. You can also try Kheeri roll. Ambience may not be one of the best, but the service is good so you will get your food without having to wait much. It is comparatively less crowded than Aminia, which is also nearby. You can try Biriyani, specially the Hydrabadi Biriyani, it has got a lot of colorful dry fruits sprinkled all over it. My friend favorite dishes are Beef items which are also signature dishes of the Nizam.

I have been to Nizam's since my childhood. The time, when Zomato was not there. Their rolls are legendary and need no elaborate explanation. The khati kababs are simply out of the world. I remember they also featured in the famous good show of NDTV goodtimes FoodMad. It's not a Kolkata icon but a national icon as well.
During the Ramadan times I never miss a bowl of hot Haleem. Last year I went to Royal another very famous mughlai restaurant of Kolkata.
Nizam's is a legendary place, it is legendary for its food. So it will be unfair for you to ask for a luxury fine dining experience. They specialises in food not in proving ambience. The non air conditioned dining area can be bit uncomfortable during the hot days. The place is not that much hygienic and the utensils are not very fancy either. It has a large sit and dine area. The sitting it somehow comfortable.
We ordered 2 bowls of mutton haleem, 4 tandoori roti, 1 khuskha and one mutton biriyani. The total billed amount was Rs 515.

The hot bowl of haleem was garnished with fried onion, green chilli, ginger Juliennes and coriander leaves. In the bowl came 2 moderate pieces of super soft melt in your mouth type mutton. The haleem was hot and tasty. The seasonings were perfect and the slice of lemon given along side, when squished in gave the haleem an extra kick and a different depth of taste. However the consistency of the haleem was bit loose and not like the Royal's Haleem which have a thick consistency.
Most of the people prefer their haleem as it is but I generally have tandoori roti along with it. For me the flat taste of the tandoori roti provide a break from the spicy haleem. The tandoori roti was soft and moist and was fresh from the tandoor.
Khuskha is nothing else but the biriyani rice without any meat or potato. The mutton biriyani was very tasty and a classic Kolkata biriyani. It was bit greasy but the rice was perfectly booked with all the seasoning at their perfect level. The mutton piece was juicy , well seasoned and was a solid meat chunk. The potato also absorbed the flavours very well. Overall all the dishes were made to perfection and with care.
The waiters are well behaved and vigilant not even once we had to ask to retail our glasses and the service was also prompt.
Had a great time, lovely food, easy on pocket. A must visit. I am looking forward for my next visit.

I came to the beef serving outlet with a lot of enthusiasm. And I ordered beef biriyani with beef kabab. I cannot say that I have been disappointed. But I can't say that it blew my mind away either. The biriyani is pretty much standard. I give the place 4/5 purely because of the kabab which was quite good. Worth a visit if you love beef and want a Kolkata treatment of it.

Nothing more to say about this legend of Kolkata food map.visited many times for kebabs and tandoori. This time had an unexpected experience. Ordered tengri kebab(full) for two of us. After almost 20 minutes the wrapped chicken legs came in. 
Gave a large bite without waiting but what a shit!!!!!! Inside the chicken was cold a bit. That was hard to take. Called waiter and changed the food.
Another thing is the ambience is not fit for dining.flies all around,waiters with dirty clothes,plates with old strains.. Nizam,u need to remake urself.

Other dishes which r awesome here r the kebabs,mutton pasinda.

Over 100 years of existence and apart from being the pioneers of making the first Kolkata Rolls, Nizam's is famous for all kind of nawabi food. Landmark in itself made it easy for a first time diner like me to find it.
We entered, and were seated immediately as the place was mostly empty at around 4 30pm in the evening.¬†Our order was taken quickly and was delivered even quicker. Kathi rolls! First bite and that was all we needed to ask for more. Never ever I had a roll that was so crispy from outside but with soft, succulent and juicy meat that had been cooked and tempered with nicely fried onions and green chillies in a host of Indian spices. Nizam's is a blessing to Kolkata. A must visit.

One of the best beef restaurant in Kolkata especially the most famous one at new market.. it is very hard to taste their food because the place is crowded most of the time..  as a result you have to stand for a long time, however the food is soo  tasty the waiting is worth for it.. they have one of the finest quality of beef. you should try out their halem,  bhuna and coolfi. . the set backs are there is no AC and tables are not cleaned properly. .

The name itself is quite famous. Its one of the oldest one in kolkata. I liked how the waiters used to dress in pathani suits, but they dnt anymore. The quality of the dishes have also deceased over the years. The chicken recipes are below average. Moreover the place is not at all hygienic. You will occasionally find a rat moving around in the dining place or a hair or two in the food. The place now-a-days doesnt  do justice to its heritage & its name.

They proudly proclaim themselves as the inventors of the kathi roll and rightly so. Everybody knows about their infamous rolls which I had on previous occassion, so I looked towards the menu for other goodies. And in a restaurant famous for Mughlai cuisine, the other goodie can only be biryani: chicken biryani. 
Going by first impressions, when the biryani landed on our table, we figured it will be on the heavier side of the palette infused with kewra water and related aromas. On a hot weather day, that is definitely something you should avoid. But to our surprise, it was just the opposite. The rice was fluffy, golden with the proper saffron color, chicken pieces succulent and juicy and served with the quintessential potato that distinguishes Kolkata biryani from anywhere else. The whole thing was mildly spiced. It wasn't heavy on the stomach at all and we managed to finish one full plate of biryani each. 
The ambience was quite bubbly and the service was fast. For take-aways, they have a separate counter. We wanted to look for AC seating room but we couldn't find one, so we made do without AC.

Although it is now just a shadow of it's old self, I cannot help¬†but recommend Nizam's. I grew up on Biryani and rolls from this joint. The mutton biryani or the khiri roll/beef roll.........stuff of legends. The service is the still the same, but the food has reduced a little bit in standard over the years. I am sure that most people that have grown up in Kolkata has had a taste of this place at some point. But if you are going to the new to the city or just visiting and happen to be in the New Market area, give this place a go at least once. It is a far cry from class and fine dining but if it is good inexpensive mughlai food you are craving, there is no missing Nizam's.

The food is nice. Kawabs nd biriyani will satiate ur pallate. The taste is quite good!!
Sumtotal is that if u visit here, u will get any eye candy or feel good feeling but satisfy ur hunger with good taste within ur budget.

I have been eating at this place for a few years now. The rolls are really good, especially the beef rolls and the succulent khiri roll. The beef biryani is affordable and really delicious while the beef kebabs are a waste. The beef bhuna is really tasty, but oily. The ambience is good in winters but not so in the summers and it gets really hot. Would not recommend visit with children.

One of the old mughlai destinations of the city, Nizam's is still a name the new and old refer to when it comes to mughlai in the city. 
Situated in new market, this place has been satisfying numerous hungry shoppers since this market is up and running. The rolls and the biryani are the top picks.
What I will always remember this place for is its rolls. The paratha u get here is one of the best I hav ever had, thin and crispy, and the kebabs do their bit in making this place an icon of rolls.

The legendary beef roll, hands down man the beef is so well cooked and soft it almost melts in your mouth, the service is more or less quick.
Note: prices of beef to be increased from tomorrow.

For old timers this was an icon, where most of the Kolkatan's tasted beef with their Khiri kebab or the famous beef rolls for the first time. Unfortunately it was plagued with labor trouble for long & reopened in a new avatar under a different with the iconic items missing. Didn't quite like the new wine in the old bottle or may be getting old & therefore unwilling to accept the change of old favorites. Sure there are a lot of people like me, who are purists & wouldn't want the greats to have a not so great a makeover.

This is really strange. My colleagues and I went by the menu provided by Zomato and decided to order Chicken Kalimiri Rolls. But while placing the order, we were told that Nizam does not make any such rolls. Very disappointing that Zomato has not updated the menu. Please do the same at the earliest.

Very disappointing...that sums up my eating experience at this place...Nizam's was recommended by my colleague during my recent trip to Kolkata...Hardly 650m from the Oberoi Grand, we chose to go to Nizam's for our dinner over the complimentary meal included in our stay and I can safely say this on behalf of my group that we will always regret our decision...

The restaurant(if we can call it one) was very dirty...we ordered egg biryani, mutton seekh kabab and chicken kathi kabab (which I assumed would be a roll)...the mutton tasted funny and was not soft...the chicken kathi kabab turned out to be pieces of chicken tikka which was ok in taste..the egg biryani was average and my colleagues had to order a vegetarian dish to go along with it...

You can skip this place if you want as I think there are better places to eat in Kolkata...

I guess for many foodies the name Nizam itself is synonymous to kathi Rolls..This is where the legendary journey of perhaps the most acclaimed fast food started..My bonding with Rolls probably got engraved thanks to the legendary servings in this place only..Still loves the first bite of soft,smoky kebabs inside a non greasy paratha and the twist provided by the extra chillies..Sadly even Nizam has slipped from its past reputation,there have been multiple shutdowns and somewhere that old Magic is lost..However still today they serves more variety of Rolls than any other outlet..Try the Mutton Shikampuri Roll someday if it is available..My rating is mainly based on my past experiences and affection for their Rolls..
Last time we went to their dine-in room we ordered:
Chicken Kalimirich Tangri Kebab: Way too much use of pepper..it actually taste a bit bitter..even the chiken should have been charred a bit more..
Beef Bhuna: I can visit this place again and again simply to savour this splendid dish..probably one of the best..though a bit oily but who cares..
Beef Chaap: Yet another signature delicacy..wonder how tender they cook this meat to be..pure bliss..
Mutton Masala: Sadly this dish was horrible..they actually serve stale mutton..foul smell was coming out of it..even they didn't bother to care much after we complain..
Service is quite lackluster and unprofessional..Also I would advise to avoid Mutton dishes here..not upto the mark..better to taste their Beef and Chicken delicacies..Prices are quite moderate..Our total cheque last time comes to around Rs.900/- for 4 people..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 1.5/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

Reputed for its Mughali food, this is really a nice place to try out the type. 
Located right opposite the road in Elite cinemas, it's not hard to locate as well. It had two shops, one which sells beef and the price there is a bit less compared to the new one which doesn't. 

I mainly go there for roll's and they really make good one's. Had Biryani and Chicken Chap too and they're all good enough. Although the quality has fallen when compared to It's earlier stages but it's fair enough. The quantity is okaish, , not too great but fair. 

If you love rolls, go for the kheeri roll (suggested by my friend) as well as the chicken and egg chicken rolls. Biryani is also worth a try.

I would always love Nizam's for their Lachha Paratha and Mutton Chanp, it's just an out of this world combination. They also serve wonderful Mutton Biryanis, a plate of which can spoil your diet plan for the month. Delicious it is! Don't miss the Firni after having the main courses.

The legacy of Kati Rolls started from Nizam's. However personally I am not too fond of their kati roll, as better rolls are available at other places too at same prices. The paratha is too thin for my liking, and the chicken pieces inside aren't meaty enough. I would have to order 3 such rolls for filling my kati roll desire.

The interior has changed over the years for the better. Waiters are also friendly and efficient. Extremely good food, at affordable rates. Nizam's would always remain special for regular shoppers at New Market.

Nizam is best known for its delicious rolls.fortunately the service so good that one need not salivate for long after ordering. The chicken rolls are just outta this world.
Try the parantha -kebab combo,it is an age old classic. and food fadists need to numb their oil free mughlai pitch,once they dine here. 
Nizam has been there for generations hence has lots of sentimental value attached to it too.

This is one of the oldest biriyani joints of this city..they are the inventors of the infamous hot Kati roll along with other delicious stuff..but the problem is they are not living up to their former glory..the food is not that good.service is questionable. The biriyani is just so-so as well as the side dishes..I would recommend to just stick with the kati rolls rather than biriyani or other delicacies

Its a landmark place of esplande and Kolkata. The progenitor Kathi Rolls. And certainly they live upto their hype. Nothing very special in ambience or hospitality. A regular restuarant. Pocket friendly. Biriyani is all ok, nothing special. But i would ask all to try their special Double paratha Double egg Double chicken Roll. Its worth its name size and cost. The chicken is moist and tender. The lachha paratha is crispy yet soft. They serve it in plate with extra lemons. So squeeze its juices. And let your taste buds savour it all. If you have good appetite, enjoy it all. If you have a small stomach, share it with your girlfriend.

Great for take away, service good though the cutlery may put you off a bit. However for the price, it delivers. Servers are very polite, so definitely points for that.

Nizam's is an institution in Calcutta. Credited for having invented the kathi roll, or at least for having introduced it to Calcutta, this place goes all out to market it's rolls, to the point of having roll based combos. They garnish the rolls with chutneys of your choice and the filling is made of kebabs and not just minced meat. The hariyali kebab roll is one that I would recommend. The kebab is marinated with a paste made of spinach and coriander leaves, giving it herby flavour that you will love. The chapli seekh roll is also brilliant. The filling is made of flattened meat balls.¬†One other USP of Nizam's is their beef offering, for which they have a completely separate wing. You can also sit upstairs in the AC as you tuck in to what is arguably the city's best beef biryani, along with a side of beef chaap and paratha.

One of the oldest eating joints in the city and still doing what they do best, making delicious Biriyanis and sumptuous Kebabs, this place is Mecca for Biriyani lovers. Legends have it that they are the ones who brought Biriyani to the common people of Calcutta.

Try the Biriyani here which is soft and aromatic with large chunks of meat, potatoes and dates. In the side dish try Beef bhuna which is a slightly spicy gravy but with a character of its own or the Beef kebabs which have an understated taste of roasted tender meat with a hint of spices and lots of caramelized onions (and yes they use actual coal fire and not ovens). And although their specialise in Tandoori food, their rolls are one of the best in class.

They have a very basic interior and the staff isn't overtly enthusiastic to serve you but they serve the food well in time and it has never tasted anything less than amazing. This is a place locked in time. Visit it for the food and nostalgia.

Nizam is certainly one of my favourites in the area of New Market! Whenever I visit New Market for anything I visit this place. The menu is pocket friendly. The quantity you get is good. it will definitely satisfy your hunger after a long spell of shopping. Ambience may not be one of the best, but the service is good so you will get your food without having to wait much. It is comparatively less crowded than Aminia which is also nearby. And this is probably a good reason to eat here.

P.S. - Try to seat yourself in the more clean and renovated area. Although any place is good with such awesome food.

What to Order:
1. Any type of Kebabs
2. Firni
3. Kulfi and by Kulfi I mean the real one.
4. Chicken Chap with Tandoori rotis is also a good combination at Nizam.( I have them almost everytime)
5. Rolls are also good for a quick bite.

Nizam's is famous for its rolls and they are absolutely with it. The stuffed parathas are highly recommended. Also the Nizam special paratha, which is the roll paratha. Perhaps it's not one of the best places to visit in the heat as it has no AC. However, they do have a tiny AC seating arrangement upstairs where you can sit if you don't mind beef.

Prominently located in the heart of esplanade , in the lane that also houses Aminia and Alibaba , this place remains a classic. The interiors are spacious and there is ample space inside, though their demand always exceeds availability. They serve all sorts of mughlai dishes , including rolls , kebabs , and of course biryani . They also have soft drinks and firni for dessert. My personal favourite , however, remains their rolls . Classic and comforting, these rolls are the reason I would Love to visit this place again and again. Try the Maharaja Biryani once, which is an interesting combination of dry fruits mixed with the classic Kolkata biryani consisting of Aloo and egg .
And for those of you misguidedly looking for beef in this restaurant, the sign outside clearly says " NO BEEF" , as is confirmed by the staff inside. The beef segment is right beside the main restaurant , slightly hidden from view , with the words "Mughal Gardens " written near the entrance . Once there , do taste the beef Biryani , which tastes average , and the beef kebab , served with half a sliced lemon and caramelised onions .

No rubbish,pure food fetish!!
Established in the year 1932, Today Nizam is one of the great casual dining hotel of Kolkata.
If you have been to New Market and have not been to Nizam, well you should not have gone then.
Well they invented Kathi roll, taught people that smokey effect of Kebab comes better when bamboo sticks aka Kathiz are used.

I ordered , 2 Paranthas (Rs 20) , One Chicken kathi Kabab(Rs 120) , One Faluda(Rs 28) , One Thumsup(Rs 22) and tipped the waiter(Rs 10).
No Tax, No bullshits.

Temperature of Kolkata was troubling a lot,a good hotel demands an AC which they could have easily accommodated but that may have increased the price of food.

May be the owner wanted to tell - You are here for food, not a Spa.Here we deal with your stomach, for any other organ there are specific places.You came to eat, now eat.
True it was!!I I never thought about ambience, service as the parameters to rate an eatery this time.The food took it all.

Nizam,I cant rate you 5 because I reserve that for my mom.

However, thanks a lot again!!
I will continue like I do, whenever I will get frustrated I will come to you.

Love, respect!!!!!

Famous place for biryani and rolls. Biryani tastes awesome-not to spicy. Tried Chicken Nargisi Biryani which comes with 2 pieces of chicken and sprinkle of dried fruits, so tastes sweet. Biryani amount is enough for single person. My favorite dish is Chicken Tangri Kebab which consists of 4 chicken leg pieces along with pudina chutney. It tastes heavenly.  Price of the dishes are decent.

I have heard of this restaurant since my childhood as my dad used to come here with his friends during his studentship for beef kebabs. So I visited this place a few months back. We had Beef Biryani, Beef Masala and Firni. The beef items were really good to taste. The meat was a little fibrous but you won't get things of better quality at such cheap rates. I think it was really good with respect to the price. The firni could have been better. But it's really a good and pocket friendly place for you to have beef whenever you want to. Happy Dining! :)

I sometimes envy the people working at the New market area and eateries like Nizam are the reason. In a stretch of street lined with some really legendary eateries, Nizam makes a mark of its own. Mostly known for its famous Kathi rolls, the place also serves some delicious beef kababs and sumptuous biriyani .The service is very prompt and friendly and it also goes very easy on the pocket. As like many other places of the area, Nizam too has a rich heritage and is one of the first places that introduced rolls in Kolkata according to popular legends.
Nizam's is definitely a must visit for Mughlai lovers.

The other stuff like biriyani etc are all very good but not as outstanding as their rolls... Special mutton rolls will lighten up anybody's day

Nizam's is one of the oldest places in town you can grab a quick bite from. There used to be a time when Nizam's used to rock with it's quality of biriyani and rolls but the legacy has washed away over the years. Now, their rolls still tastes good but they could have done a better job I'm sure. The prices they charge is pocket friendly and their ambiance is decent enough in the area. I'd still prefer Nizam's roll over any other when I'm in this area.

The biryani is really good. The quality is fine! Cooked with measurement! Perfect for hangout with friends! 
The only negetive aspect is,the restaurant lacks space as its too clumsy! Orders are delivered fast! 
All over, a nice place with good quality food at cheap price!

Have been here few times. One will surely like this place if you are not on diet and have a soft corner for spicy mughal cuisine. It is a bit crowded but the service is real quick, their special biriyani is worth trying. I also wanted to try their famous beef roll but unfortunately they stopped serving it post renovation, which was a bit disheartening.

Very disappointed with the non beef part of Nizams.. M a beef lover but as I was with my Mama n Mami who r both strict in cases of beef and everything we went to Nizams n not Moghul Gardenn. They seemed to enjoy their Paneer Aloo Roll but I was disappointed with the legendary Mutton roll of theirs! It took ages to come n d Paratha was not gud being too oily.. Mutton was nothing to crave for.  Price is reasonable or cheap but I would go for Moghal Garden any day of the week!!!

Nizam‚Äôs‚Ä¶where do I start from...
Being a Calcuttan, one is expected to know Nizam‚Äôs very well &‚Ä¶wait, *sorry‚Ä¶being a Kolkattan! ;) :P
Never mind, being a Kolkattan, one is expected or assumed to have heard of the popular Nizam‚Äôs Restaurant¬† or more so visited them to have their delicacies at least once in their lifetime.

As far as I know, Nizam‚Äôs dates way back in the old heritage times of Kolkata.

I however, am a very weird Kolkattan. I visited Nizam‚Äôs really behind in my life and had their Biryani almost like ages after. Where I should have had tried their food a lot, I liked to stick to my own favourite restaurants and didn‚Äôt budge. 

Anyway, enough of this crap. Let‚Äôs get to work!

I visited Nizam‚Äôs after like aaaages yesterday. It was a sudden plan with 3 of my friends.
We quickly (read vernacular fatafat) ordered our choices to the highly impatient waiter. Very surprisingly our waiter seemed to be very happy with us, I have no idea why.

Anywho, the reviews are the following: ;)
Egg Roll: I had ordered this as I had already had my lunch earlier. [If only I knew we were coming here I wouldn‚Äôt even have had breakfast‚Ä¶ARGH] Nonetheless, yum! Arrey, yum yaar‚Ä¶hands down. Exact amount of salt, stuffing, sauces‚Ä¶uhhhh‚Ä¶I‚Äôm watering even now while I‚Äôm posting!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† But then Kolkata has been known for its delicious rolls, hasn‚Äôt it been? I mean, I hardly know any shops or even the thelas here which makes rolls that are bad. Whatever the case, I loved it! Thank you Nizam‚Äôs! ;) you might see me again sometime! 

Plain Naans: My friends had them & I just had a bit & God guys, they were warm & soft & yum. Just like the perfect Naans should be.

Mixed Veg: One of my friends wanted to have less oily stuff & just chicken, but wasn‚Äôt in the mood for non-veg. So he ordered this! It was fun seeing him gobbling in all that like a child! They food was hot and he mentioned that this was one of the finest Mixed Veg that he had tasted anywhere. So, that‚Äôs a point up!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I‚Äôm not much of a veg person, so I skipped that! :P 

Tangri Tandoor Chicken: , It was absolutely juicy, tender, perfectly tandoor-ed! Perfectly smoked exactly at the right places. I‚Äôm a sucker for smoked and tandoor-ed chickens, so I will always speak praises about this! ;)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† My friends also had a chicken curry something. I‚Äôm sorry, I can clearly remember the dish but cannot recall the dishes‚Äô name. So there‚Äôs no point reviewing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I‚Äôm really sorry for doing this again & again. Next time, I‚Äôll write down, trust me!

& to push all that down we gulped Thumbs Up! ;) Cool na?

This restaurant doesn‚Äôt do much of shu-sha, just serves absolute incredible food without any nonsense.
The customer would be like just come-eat and go; all satisfied & happy! (Tummy full).¬† Aur kya chaiyye?
It‚Äôs highly accessible and connected, so no chance of difficulty finding this restaurant. It‚Äôs exactly in the middle of New Market area. So it‚Äôs very easily spotted as well.

The service is quick guys, seriously. You order now & 2 minutes later the waiter arrives with all the full plates in his hand amazingly & the moment you‚Äôre done, poof! Your plates are gone. They‚Äôre out of sight! That‚Äôs how quick they are!
The quality is fair enough & prices are okay-ish & decently justified. 

I‚Äôm wondering when I would go there again! ÔÅä
But then a lot of different good restaurants have also come up , so I‚Äôm just giving it a thought.

But one should definitely try Nizam‚Äôs at least once, I mean, you‚Äôre in Kolkata & haven‚Äôt been to Nizam‚Äôs? Shame on you! ;) Just kidding!

Try it out, you might like it! ÔÅä
Ciao.

One of my favourite biryani joints,this place has never disappointed me.Whenever i am in New Market i make it a point to drop in and have my favourites- a plate of beef biryani + a plate of beef kabab...sorry,but i am just addicted to this combo & also a firni to end with.Cheap as ever and the service is real quick n good.Apart from this,this is the place where i first tasted beef in the early days of my college life so,...a lot of pleasant memories were made here and since then i hav never ever fallen out of love with Nizam's.Be it the rolls/biryanis/kababs/bhunas I enjoy every visit to this place.

Yesterday I ate beef handi biriyani. There are few things they should be concerned about it.
1.please serve the biriyani in a fresh and a clean pot.it was very sticky and oily. I lost my half interest after seeing it.
2.meat pieces are too stiff.
3.you guys are in 2015 and were one of the best biriyani centre in Kolkata. Please make some improvement of the hotel atmosphere. 
4.the good thing was the biriyani was light and was in a huge quantity .
5. Overall its average

Nizam is one of the oldest resturants in the city and also one of the best. If you want ambience, air condition and decoration you may try somewhere else. But in terms of food, it is second to none. Kathi kebabs are the one everybody talks about..its excellent obviously. The biriyani is too good and so light. The side dishesh like kadai mutton and chiken reshmi are out of this world. All the dishes have their signature tastes which you will find nowhere in the town. Also you must have Firni as a dessert. Nizam prepares ,by far , the best Firni in town. What are you thinking? Just make it your priority to visit the place.
And price..you will be amazed by how cheap it is.

I just go there for one thing only. "The Kati Rolls".... No matter what the meat is, Nizam's rolls are the best in the city. The vibe here might not be appealing to some, but when it comes to the quality of the stuff that you are going to gulp down, Nizam's wins. And the prices are so affordable that you feel like ditching your gym's diet plan for good and eating there everyday. Besides rolls, the Mutton Korma and the Biriyani served there are also great. When you arrive at Nizam's, you might not feel being treated like one, but once you start munching on the good stuff, you start on a gastronomical journey that is hard to forget.

Nizam is an ideal place for beef lovers. The food quality is great and it is very pocket friendly. Nizam service is even better and the beef biriyani is to die for. The ambience is a little shabby and it doesn't have an a.c. setting but a real foodie should visit this place to experience great food in the heart of the city.

There was a time when Nizams meant "Kati Rolls". Before movies,after movies,late night after a party,take home for family and kids,for parties at home. Anytime was kati time and Nizams was THE place.You drove up and an attendant showed you a parking spot and you ordered your" double andaa double chicken" with a coke or Thumsup....and presto you got it piping hot in your car all wrapped up in paper----and they¬†were just the best thing you ever had¬† !!!!!!!!!!Unfortunately the place got sold and a lot of the old staff and cooks went elsewhere¬† and the Rolls somewhat have lost "that something extra".It no longer is THE place for Rolls as a number of really super outlets have comeup in the Park Street area area. However do try it out for your satisfaction¬† and curiosity.

The rolls are simply amazing my favourite being the double egg mutton roll. The kulfi with faluda is exquisite and it's quite pocket friendly it's an amazing place for a quick bite. This is one of the few evergreen places in kolkata which has still kept its pride and glory.

I had heard a lot about this place, and had gone there with a lot of expectations. The ambiance is nothing to boast about. But it is very spacious and clean. The food was alright, but was delivered quickly. We ordered two chicken rolls, and a chicken biryani. The rolls were okay, but I've had better at Park Street! Same with the biryani, the quantity was good, taste was okay too, but not better than other popular chains. It was a very economic place, though. Great for a quick bite.

Nizam's - The Calcutta's legendary kathi kebab house had seen better days. The place is teeming, ¬†the ambiance is very basic and the food is not what it once was... The waiters seemed tired and barely bothers to serve you with improper attitude... which is a big let down.....

I'd heard a lot about kolkata being the gastronomic capital of India. So I Looked up best places to eat in the city, Nizam came up in almost every list! Quite worthy, with their rich heritage and historic menu, they didn't disappoint! The delicious non vegetarian food was spicy-juicy to just the right amount.

¬†

Had chicken kathi rolls, chicken kebabs and Firni. I'm a little partial to rolls, so i couldn't have not liked it at a place where it's supposedly invented. (There's there whole story behind the menu, how the founder wrapped the roti with the kebabs as the British duds didnt like their hands getting oily). 

Kebabs and rolls had a little too much pepper, i could feel them in my throat a little too much. Was a little oily too, but  Otherwise food was good enough.

Service was okay, we got our orders fast enough. Restaurant being popular is very crowded but i gather its part of the restaurant's ambiance.

Yesterday, I was walking down new market area when I thought of taking a bite of Nizam's kathi kabab roll. They are the so called inventor of kathi kabab roll. Hugely disappointed. Nothing special about it. Stuffed with too much of onion which kills the taste. What I like is the tenderness of the chicken. 

Note: This rating is only for their roll.

A puzzle of sorts which is solved by asking the right questions. The Nizam's on the corner is a sanitised space which doesn't serve the real stuff. Ask for Nizam's Mughal Garden - 2 doors away and then you're in the 'right' place.
Double kathi single anda roll - an all time classic is heaven on earth. The single anda aloo roll, a well kept secret, is to die for too.
I gave up eating them sitting in the car thanks to the barrage of beggars knocking around. I sit inside - it's not as grotty as one would think - and enjoy my kathis, one after another - freshly made and hot off the griddle. 
Looked the length and breadth of the country and there is NO ONE to match the flavour of this place.

Located at the heart of Kolkata amidst the busy Govt. Offices, this place is an excellent eater's soujourn providing you with delicacies roasted in traditions carried forward through generations since the British Raj. The infamous creation of Nizam's: The Kati Roll, left no room for any judgement as it drowned us in its ambrosial flavour. It is perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy inside creating a succulent amalgamation of all the ingredients without giving any hint of pungency to it. There are a very few places in the city compared to this, which let you indulge to a food, as simple as a roll, to this extent. Definitely worth trying and retrying.

What can you say about the inventor of kanthi roll? Started visiting this place during college days (late seventies) when budget was low and appetite high. Was extremely lucky and am thankful to my college mate who insisted on visiting here. The old charm remains even though ownership has changed. Started off with what else - the roll. Followed by the other famed 'beef curry' with its signature oily curry. Finished off with 'firni'. 

Thank you Nizam's for feeding us - the shoe stringer collegians of the long gone seventies.

Once I heard somewhere that you should leave kolkata immediately if you did not have Nizam's kathi roll staying in kolkata.. So we had to go to this place, after all it's the city of joy and who wants to leave Kolkata! We went to this place around a year back. The restaurant can be easily located, nothing great about the ambience just a normal food joint. But I loved their kathi roll, both chicken and mutton. The amount of meat was good and it being my 1st kathi roll experience, it was totally different from the normal rolls we have grown up eating. We also ordered chicken kababs and they were juicy and yummy :) squeeze the lemon over the kababs and you will fall in love with them! I will definitely try out their biriyani asap!

Nizam's, Nizam's, Nizam's. THE restaurant of my childhood. As a central Kolkata boy born and brought up in Park Street, I have tasted every item of this restaurant in its many avatars. 

Coming to the present, its widely famed roll (which it invented) is now over shadowed by its more modern competitors in Park Circus. Nizam's rolls of the present era have taste, but lacks the "umami" factor- which the Park Circus restaurants have. The rolls are also insanely greasy. Biting into a roll means shaving 6 hours off your life.

Other items are okayish. Like many other heritage food spots, Nizam's is riding on its history. Take the peel off, and you have nothing to recommend.

They used to be legends at a time but their quality has deteriorated considerably over the last few years. Didn't have a good experience here, not even with the rolls they make. Oily, super spicy stuffed with green chilli even when we specifically asked the man at the counter not to add any. It leaves a grease in your mouth for an hour or so. Any standard street side fast food centre makes better rolls than Nizam's.

SINCE 1932!!
It's a legendary restaurant which stands tall at New Market, the inventor of Kathi Rolls. Greetings, ambiance these are certain things you shouldn't look forward to. I went there on the evening of December 29 just to have kebabs with two friends of mine.

I tried the famous CHICKEN KATHI KEBAB, but wasn't much intrigued by it. It didn't strike me as a dish worthy of as much appraisal it gets but it definitely has a distinct aroma to it. Instead the CHICKEN PESHAWARI KEBAB was much more impressive soft, juicy chicken with a different flavour. CHICKEN TANGRI KEBAB was hard roasted, wrapped in aluminium foil and served well garnished. CHICKEN TANDOORI KEBAB was a disappointment though excessively cooked with burnt crust almost black. Well a pinch of chat masala doesn't make everything tasty.

Health Tip: Keep away from the fennel

Nizam is one of the pocket friendly choices when you are tired and hungry from excess shopping at the New Market area.

Food: Quantity is little more than sufficient and quality is too good. The Biryani was spicy but not oily, the chicken was succulent and the paneer was soft & delicious. I have heard this place became famous for its "Kati Rolls", although I haven't had the chance to try it yet. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: People don't come here for the ambience. It's a pretty plain restaurant with simple chairs & tables and no fancy decor. In rush hours, it takes a little time to clean up a table after one customer has left and before you start using his place. I rate it 3/5.

Service: They are very fast generally. The waiters are always running around taking orders and carrying food. In rush hours though there might be slight delay. Staffs is very well-behaved. I rate it 4/5.

Price: It is economical. The food is worth more than what they charge.

Overall I give it 4/5.

It was on 24th December. I and my bestie went to shopping to esplanade and landed here to satisfy our hunger as usual. It is behind the new market. D√©cor is very simple with white walls and well lighted. We ordered chicken tandoori, sigree kebab platter and Nizam's cheez special kebab. The tandoori was delicious as always but the cheez special kebab was also very tasty and the smell was mouth watering. In platter they served chicken mutton and fish kebabs-a total of 5 types, out of which the mutton was not that good and a bit hot and hard whereas the fish and chicken ones are really well prepared and tasted awesome. The pudina chutni they offered with kebabs was too good. Price is reasonable and pocket fiendly. Service is good too but what i dislike the most is to share table with unknowns since it is too crowded.

Nizams is located behind new market in the lane opposite to Elite cinema.
The ambience may not be great. Take away is a great option who doesn't want to seat inside. The biriyani can beat many famous outlets. The chicken and mutton items are also great.
The rolls are good and tasty.
Price very reasonable.

We ordered chicken maharaja biryani, butter tandoori roti and chicken bharta. Must say the chicken bharta was really good. But the biryani, although a but different, did not taste as good ! And last, but not the least, one of us ordered a Double Egg Double Chicken Roll. Yes, they had certainly kept up to their reputation! It was awesome. Overall, a pocket friendly yet a more than average restaurant. Rating : 3.5/5.

Nizam's is a household name for kathi rolls in Kolkata . If You are a kathi roll and Biryani fan , U definately must try this place.  . The Biryani is perfected with the right amount of spices . The rolls are heavy  . The kebabs are satisfactory. The Chicken chap is stale everytime I try it though   There is a Kulfi shop attached to it , from where U can order colourful kulfi's . One should definitely give this place a try if one turns hungry in the New Market area.

With my father's work station situated at the very end of New Market, I practically grew up eating rolls from Nizam's. But the first time I visited their joint was with my friends to try out their famous beef biriyani.¬†

The ambiance and seating arrangement was not up to the mark but then again for food like theirs I'm more than ready to compromise. The order was simple- Beef Biriyani and Chicken Bharta. The chicken pieces were soft and juicy. The curry was rich and oily. One of those casual dining experience where one cannot worry about their waist size.¬†
And, coming back to the beef biriyani, it was rich and tasty. To my surprise, the beef pieces were perfectly boiled and not very chewy. The biriyani rice was just the right amount of rich with perfect balance of spices.¬†
Cannot wait to go back again. :)

food: the rolls are really great. though last time i visited they made the size smaller. chiken roll and beef roll is my favourite. though for beef you have to visit the moughlai garden by nizam's. biriyani is cheap but not great. so is the kebab.

ambience and service: never mind! 

price: very very cheap. so its the perfect hangout place between shopping in new market area. rolls are really the best that you can get in kolkata.
overall not for the snobs. this place defimes value for money. and not to mention the best place to get good quality cheap beef too.

A legend in itself, I am a frequent visitor and fan of its Mughal Garden part, where they have the fantastic beef dishes. The Beef Bhuna, beef kebab, beef biriyani, or paranthas are amazingly awesome and you should definitely have once in your life. Now the upstairs section is an AC one, while it's left to fans downstairs. It is particularly hot in summer days, so avoid that. The veg dishes like kashmiri aloo, paneer butter are also quite good. Prices are great! Staff is like that of Aminia or superfast moving restros only, order-get-and pay type ;-)

First off, there are two outlets. One of them serve beef and the other doesn't.
We went to the one serving beef.

My first memories of this place, were when I was a 6 year old kid!

Went there with my mom and my dad .. and I ate a WHOLE plate of beef kebabs.. a 6 year old!! I guess I was a foodie back then as well! :P

This time round, it was a visit after 6 long years. Thing's haven't changed much!

We ordered beef bhuna and Nizam's special beef pasinda along with 4 plain paranthas.

The beef bhuna was NICE! I would love to marry that gravy!

The special beef pasinda was ..umm ... special! The 'almost' poached fried egg that formed the base of the dish, had to be dug up from the bottom. The gravy again was good, but it was a bit mild compared to the bhuna .. the beef was tender and juicy in both the dishes..

The paranthas were just heavenly! Crisp. Golden Brown. Not too oily.

And the best part is, after your meal, once you wash your hands with soap, your hands won't be sticky anymore and it won't smell as well!

It was great to be back after 6 long years. Hopefully. I wont wait for another 6 to come back again!! :)

Food : 4.5/5
Cost : 4.5/5
Ambiance : 4/5 ( One does not go to Nizam's for a romantic candlelit dinner!)

I remember my mother taking me to Nizam's whenever we visited my maternal grandparents who used to reside near this area. My mom loved kathi rolls and Nizams was the ultimate place. Mom told me that they were the inventors of rolls and are the pioneers in the city. Over the years a lot of food joints and eateries have cropped up in the adjoining area but the rolls of Nizams are a must try if you are in this area. After ages i visited nizams and tried out the biryani t a few days ago. The taste is still the same though i was not very happy with the cleanliness of the place. You have to visit here only to taste the food and turn a blind eye to everything else :)

Ok, to start with , if you are shopping in esplanade and are really hungry and have a great favourism for mughlai food then this is the place you must hop and jump to. The mixed rolls are really good like you can try the egg chicken roll or double egg roll. Tandoori chicken and kebabs are really nice and juicy. If you are a birynai lover you can seriously relise the biryani. Other than these , chaps and gravies are average. The ambience is not that great or rather up to the mark. Its been there for ages now and still doing a very good job. But yes if you enjoy good food, and want it in a good budget this is the place must visit next time you are hungry in New Market..

Nizam's are the inventors of hot kati rolls in kolkata.The ‚ÄòKathi Kebab Roll‚Äô is a heavenly delicacy made with roasted Chicken, Mutton, or Beef, stuffed in Parathas. This kebab roll is sinfully oily and a very filling one. But if you are a true foodie, this will not bother you a bit. Anyway, all good things in this world are sinful, aren‚Äôt they?
Seekh Kebab and hot parathas have great taste, but little extra oily. You can go for anything from beef to chicken. Just wrap them and grab a bite, you will certainly feel good.

The first time kaathi roll in Nizam, I could not think of any other roll. Loved their roll so much, that being away from Kolkata for about an year, this was the first place I wanted to go to for fast food. And then came the big disappointment.¬†
We had ordered double egg double chicken roll. The amount of chicken that was stuffed, it was just upsetting. I just didnt get any special feeling of kaathi roll that it is famous for! They had unreasonably reduced their quality and not to mention, quantity. I would think twice before I go back to this place.

The creator of the Kati Rolls, that says it all.
The best kati rolls that you will find anywhere. The rolls still eludes the sauces that have taken places for the lemon and the chillis, which one finds a common trends across all the nooks and corner Kati rolls centres across Kolkata. 
The Parathas here have been very light since the begining and continue to be the same, one can almost have two rolls at one time, unlike the other centres. The chicken kewas are as succulent as ever. 
One will always find the old tradition here may be its for the food or the traditional attitude of the waiters. Nonetheless the most frequented restuarant for all the Kati Rolls lovers.

They serve beef and its quite popular among the customers as it is very cheaply priced and also very good in taste.

This is the place if you want beef and that too for cheap. A plate of beef biriyani with two big juicy chunks of meat costs the unbelievable price of Rs 60. Our usual menu for a Nizam's lunch is beef biriyani, beef kebab and firni. The beef kebab deserves special mention because the pieces are so soft they melt in your mouth. We had no idea before coming here that beef could taste like that. Other beef and chicken items are good too. Though word of caution, you don't go there for the ambiance. It is full of hustle bustle and isn't air conditioned either. But the food makes it worth the trouble.

This place is truly legendary in terms of biryani. For a biryani lover, this place is a must to visit. I love the chicken biryani and egg chicken roll here. It's so well prepared that the sight of it makes you drool over it. The service is prompt and swift. Firni is always a must for me. My meal is not complete until I have it. This place is quite affordable I must say. Thus, just stop thinking and go for it!!

So I was out helping my cousins for their Durga Puja shopping and just happened to be in New Market, and this opportunity was not to be missed. Shopping done we were pretty hungry, and quickly ordered Chicken Biriyani, Nizam's paratha and a Mutton Dum Handi. Service was lightning fast and we had food in our tables before we were done washing our hands. The biriyani was hot and lovely, beautiful aroma, melt in your mouth potato and soft  juicy chicken, overall tasted fabulous. And then the hero of our order the mutton dum handi, firstly it is very rich with chunks of butter and fresh cream over it(not for the health conscious) but when you taste it you are left craving for more and more. The dish has 3 pieces of mutton and they were soft juicy ones with right amounts of fat(btw love mutton fat) and the gravy just went so well with the parathas which was ok(shiraj and zeeshan make better).

The place is so good for your taste buds and specially for your pocket. 

Note- They have expanded the menu and they are serving many more items than in the menu here in Zomato, very very tempting ones indeed.

Kathi rolls and egg rolls are part of Kolkata's culture. Kathi Rolls were invented in Nizams. A young chef rolled Kathi kababs in parathas to please the sahibs and the roll was born. The hotel is named after his son. Situated near the new market, it is a favoured stomping ground of Bangladeshis visiting Kolkata on shopping tour. Biryani and Halim (meat porridge) during ramzan is worth trying.

Ahh Nizams... The favourite haunt of the Anglo indian shopper (especially at Christmas) Ever so dissapointed with the biriyani I ate at other restaurants, I decided to give old faithful a try. Dont go here if your looking for a fancy set up... i wouldnt look inside the kitchen if u asked me to. The restaurant doesn't have an AC but even when the current wen off for about 15 minutes no one seemed to care because the food was worth it. 

Prices are so reasonable, the biriyani was YUM and of course their signature 'Anda aloo chicken' roll was just too good!! It's true what they say, 'old is gold!' Giving them a 4.0 for their food!

One of the oldest food joints in Central Calcutta, this restaurant has earned a fame for itself for the finest kathi rolls it sells. The restaurant has got two sections: Nizam's Restaurant (with no beef) and Nizam's Moghal Garden (with beef available in plenty). Without going far into the discussion about how hygenic the place is or the manners of the staff, this place is surely to stop by, at least once, if you are in Calcutta. The kathi rolls (a speciality of Calcutta) definitely keep up to its reputation; what makes them so delicious are the kababs. And the kababs (beef, chicken, mutton) along-with biryanis are enough to allay anyone's appetite. While the Nizam's Restaurant is huge and spacious, Nizam's Moghal Garden is a bit cramped up for space. So, if one is averse to having beef, the former is decent enough place to drop in (in no way denigrating the other).

I had visited this place after finishing off my shopping at new market to try some rolls as we really hungry and tired. On entering the place you are greeted by a red ambiance which is just average and nothing worth mentioning about. The staff was a bit slow and laid back while taking down the order maybe because the place was pretty vacant at the time we entered. 
Coming to the order we ordered
egg chicken haryali roll
chicken rudi roll
paneer multani roll

All the above items were nice to taste but nothing exceptional. They were oily as expected. The best part about the rolls were the chicken pieces which were good in size and were soft as well. 
Price wise its just reasonable. An average place to sum it up.

Kolkata is famous for hot kathi rolls and nizam's is the oldest and is the "baap" of all roll centres. Name any roll and it is tasty here. Even if u eat the paratha with onion and chilli, nizam still creates a mark of its own and the taste will stay forever. Once the roll is eaten, you will not like any other rolls. The rolls aside , the next thing that I love here is the mutton rezala. The amazing gravy . The amazing mutton and what if the lachchha paratha creates the magic? The magical duo can make a person who detests mughlai crave for mughlai dishes.

I went to Nizams about four years back with a couple of friends from school. We were very hungry and very interested. We ordered Kebabs, Chicken Chaap and Mutton Biriyani and waited anxiously. Delivery tiime was good and the taste was super. By super I mean very good but of course I gave it a 3.5 because I have tasted much better Biriyani and Kebabs as well. I didnt give this place a 4.0 also because the ambiance was not really to my liking.By this I eman that it was alright but non-fine dining places are also much better. But its alright and if you do go to New Market you can enjoy a meal here. I would suggest go with friends, not family  and NEVER on dates.

(I love hyderabadi biriyani there the most)...and its kulfi is amazing with all that rose syrup squirted all over... But one particular thing gets to me everytime I go there,its their waiters. :D I mean you get served by a pathan...wearing a pathani dress...how nice is that... :P

Nizam's one of the oldest mughlai restaurant in kolkata. From 1930s this restaurant suppose to house some of the best mughlai dishes along with the inventor of the famous kathi roll.As the inventors,they still makes the best kathi rolls probably in the whole country and there no doubt about that. 

Located conveniently in Hogg market just few shops from Aminia. They have two sections one is Mughal Gardens and Nizam's both work under the same management. 
I first had their rolls when my brother took me there.. But the place is unhygienic now.. Not maintained very well. 
Still now i believe there service is the fastest and that's what i like about. 
Coming to the food.. I always order their -
Chicken kathi rolls -The chunks of chicken wrapped up in laccha parathas are heavenly soft and the pieces melts in your mouth. 
Till date no one can match Nizam's kathi rolls. 
Beef biryani - There biryani is flavourful with proper amount of spice.. And its very light.. The beef cooks just perfect...
Kababs - The awesomeness of Nizam's kababs are must recommendable.. Surely its an delight to have it. 
Nizam's speaks history and nostalgia.. The place has its old charm but some small shortcomings too..this place can be crowded on the festival season. 

Below some pros and cons -
 Pros-
Fast service. 
Best kathi rolls in the country. 
Cheap pricefor the quality they offer. 
Convenient location. 


Cons-
Small place sometimes can be very crowded in the festival season. 
Unhygienic and not maintained properly. 
Place does have a proper ambience. 

SUGGESTIONS- DO TRY THE HALIM AS IT IS ONLY MADE ON RAMZAN MONTHS..ITS ONE OF THE BEST IN NIZAM'S.

nizam's kathi roll is what kolkata is known for. i grabbed the kathi rolls from parkstreet & also from here but the last time i tried the kathi kebab. the stuffing of the rolls are special in nizam's & an amazing treat to the tastebud. i went for the usual nizam's rolls so long but won't give the nawab's roll a miss next time. getting into this age old renowned place, positioned in a crowded shabby noisy back lane full with chaos in the new market area was itself a venture & the last time we 2 girls were all set to have beef & mutton kebabs. the rolls from nizam's had always been a clean win but the kebab platters (separately) were absolutely mind blowing - specially when you get to have one full plate of smoking hot soft mutton sikambari and one chicken lola seekh kebab while it was raining heavily  outside. but we sought something else there - we asked the waiter for beef but to our surprise he cautiously said a big 'no'. we sealed the deal there. we also ordered firni but this kind of dessert is not of my type personally ( though the firni i had in other places tasted better to me). so i opted for juice later. overall it was a smoking nawabi feast there. we also found the waiter a bit sticky and too curious - no doubt he accompanied us so long & recommended us about what to take, but he kept an eye over us that caused quite a discomfiture. ( it was my personal experience though) we went out in the rain & left the place immediately. though nizam's was a mixed experience - with its milieu which is a blend of old & new, the taste of nizam's will remain unbeaten - a must go for all once if you are a true Calcuttan.

For the mughlai lovers this is the place of joy. I had been there thrice, all three times I ordered for biryani, 1st for mutton and another two times beef. (Beef is not served here, you have to go to "nizam's mughal garden"; just beside original nizam's)

The taste is really awesome, they will serve you fast. Staffs are nice. The ambience may seem a little not up to the mark, but with whole package it will delight you. The price are also reasonable.

Taste - very good. I do not like oily biriyani and they do not serve oil laden biriyani.

The meat is always well cooked. Soft and very well seasoned. i have found many a times in many biriyani restaurants that the meat is undercooked, but never here !



the service is very quick always. 

The place is decent and not air conditioned, but it has the old world charm and is quite comfortable. There is a sitting arrangement where the restaurant is separated in two parts. the decor is simple and you can tell that the budget was not that high. 
I like the fact that they have a place to wash hands where there is liquid soap, cause sometimes this food can make your hands messy.
A pocket friendly option for a filling meal.

The Kathi Kebab Inventor. I have been to this place 3-4 times and every time with the name of Nizam's I feel the same excitement and hunger. Their specialty is in Biriyani, Kebabs, Rolls and Mughlai cuisines. Special rolls and kebabs are real delight of this place and in this category this place is certainly a legend in Kolkata.
Not at all pricey, a perfect place to feel your empty stomach without making a bigger hole in your wallet. A place to hangout with your buddies. I give a 4.2 rating.

A legacy of over 80 years deserves more stars that's what people expect for this historic restaurant. 

Disappointed, that's what I was after coming for a lunch here. 

Located in the heart of New Market, Nizam's has two wings the Mughal Garden (for Beef lovers) and the Nizam's itself which serves No Beef products.

Coming to the ambience it was disappointing Dirty floors, greasy tables and for hygiene lovers this would be a nightmare watching rats having a gala time in their kitchen.

Food is what we go for in a Restaurant and even here Nizam's did not fail to disappoint me, the Chicken in Chicken Chap was not washed properly with Blood smeared bones, it was terrible I had not experienced this even on roadside eateries. The Biriyani was average nothing extraordinary. 

Nizam's is synonymous with Hot Kathi Rolls and it is the quality of its Rolls that has kept this joint's running I suppose. They serve the best Kathi Rolls in Kolkata period.

Overall if you look at a restaurant and if it did not provide you with a Wow moment in its food and a taste so unique it should linger on your taste buds for weeks I don't think its worth a higher rating.

With due respect to the Nostalgic Kolkatan's I find this place over rated on Zomato for what it is today.

Nizams is good! Because I ate at Nizam's on a recent trip to Kolkata and I am now in Chennai and when hungry the thought of the food of Nizams, the way the smell of saffron gently wafts from that box of biryani is my redemption. :) I incidentally stayed in one of the guest houses in the New Market Area on Sudder Street and so the entire range of  Kolkattan Chat and food were available to me.

Nizams biryani coupled with its katti rolls(whatever variety they may be) make for extremely filling great food.

This busy place amidst the New Market Area is famous for its Mughlai cuisine.
The rolls, kebabs and biriyanis from this place are lip smacking. Chicken Hariyali Kebab is one such dish of its kind that we never ever miss it out whenever we visit this place. Either savoring it with rumali roti or lacha paratha over there or as a take away,  we never ever miss out this particular dish. Though it falls into the category of very spicy food yet its irresistible and adding the dash of lemon to it makes it pretty much tempting!!

The place serves beef and it is written all over it. 
It got a vibe that snobs dont eat beef here and its for regular or cheap joes.
Food is tasty and given at an amazing price and also quantity is good.
Service quick and waiters are well mannered. 
So if one can adjust with the ambiance definitely go and try the kebabs and less oily gravy dishes ( the qurma , bhoona and all tastes almost similar ) . The biryani is quiet decent.


happy eating

Last Friday, my partner and i went for our first beef biriyani. We have been a fan of beef but it has always been beef steak and shepherd's pie but never biriyani. So we planned a trip to the famous beef specialist of our city. The beef section is segregated under a separated roof and named the Mughal Garden. It didn't look very impressive from the outside. We stepped in and pardon me for saying so, but it was hot. We opted for the ac section upstairs and got a tad bit of relief. After we settled down, the waiter helped us with his suggestions and we ordered half plate beef kebab, half khiri kebab, two beef biriyani, one beef bhuna. The biriyani impressed me : decent quantity @Rs 60 ( i couldn't finish ) light and not so sticky-oily, two  solid chunks of meat and right on flavor, not overtly spicy. The beef kebab was nice, small pieces of meat, very tasty. Khiri kebab is very different, as it is the breast part and texture is different. Beef bhuna was okay, nothing special... just a regular spicy side dish.
The food tasted good to us, quantity very overwhelming considering the price. I'd give a 4 for the food-quality-quantity-price factor. But then there comes another factor. I never expected this to be a fancy dining. But they could put a little effort in fixing the place a little bit. There is nothing unhygienic that i could spot, but overall it appeared so. But then again, when one serves food that tastes so wonderful at such prices, one need not bother about the clientele, right? Still,the management could give it a thought.

The origin of Kati rolls is the king of Kati rolls. The restaurant has a great location and is situated in the busy New Market. The restaurant is always bustling with patrons relishing the rolls, kebabs and other mughlai cuisines. I always order the egg mutton kati roll which contains tender mutton, onions, spices and lime juice . They don't put any sauces which makes the kati roll very tasty. The staff is helpful and polite and the ambience is good.

If you like Mughlai..its a suggestible destination. Biriyani is good..be careful when you order because some biriyanis contain many dry fruits which may not taste that impressive.

The  Biriyani tastes different from other eateries but in a good way.I would recommend their Hyderabadi Biriyani.
Reshmi kababs and tangri kababs are my another fave.
Its pocket friendly,serves real quick and waiters are always happy to help and suggest the best.

Today I visited Nizam's for the 1st time. The weather was sultry as hell 2day & I so wished they had an AC :( 
But my this grievance vanished into the air as the food simply made up for it...!
Inspite of some of the staffs being a lil rude... the service was provided at lightening speed.
We ordered Lacchedar parantha, Chicken Bharta to play safe and experimented with Mutton Tikia along with Tandoori roti. 
The Bharta dint impress me much as it was unnecessarily topped with too many green chillies & Green Capcicums :/
but the parantha was yum. 
The oders were authentic mughlai in smell and taste... well close!
The firni at the end of the meal..won my heart.
The place being quite  pocket friendly is worth giving a random try :)

A favourite from the old Kolkata. But for me, worth making a trip only if you are into beef. Yes, definately, one of the best beef biriyanis and khirri kebabs are found here, but apart from that its ordinary. The mughlai was a nice experience. The rolls are good but overrated as far as I am concerned. The food is not bad, but not anything special either. The beef though is very good

The sitting is simple and the staff is quite helpful. Ordered double chicken roll n kaathi roll. after having th3 first bite, I knew I made good choice, the taste of lemon, chutney was in right amt and the chicken was tasted just right as it should. If u dont wanna spend much and still wanna hav great rolls, Nizam's is the place for u.

I go to this place only for the rolls, and till date, this place serves the most quintessential Kolkata Kathi Rolls. What sets them apart from the rest are the robustly flavorful pieces of Chicken and pickled onions that go in. My recommendation - Double Chicken Roll. Video - https://vimeo.com/65055112

This restaurant introduced the novel idea of wrapping up the parathas and kathi kababs into a piece of paper and that's how rolls came into existence. Located in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the new market area, Nizam's is truly heaven for the Roll and Beef lovers. The restaurant is divided into two sections: The main Nizam's section which serves non beef items and the Mughal Garden section just beside which serves beef items. As far as the main section is considered, they do maintain the legacy of serving excellent Kathi rolls. The egg chicken roll, egg mutton roll, paneer roll are awesome.¬† Apart from the rolls, their biriyani and kabab items are decent enough. Don't forget to try Nizam's special paratha with chicken kathi kababs.
The beef section is truly a paradise for beef lovers in kolkata. All the beef items are excellent. The beef lovers must test their Beef biriyani and beef pasinda. Only problem is that they use a lot of oil in almost every items, so it won't suit perfectly for the hygiene freak people. Overall, a good place to fulfill your appetite with a pocket friendly budget.

The King of the Kathi Roll and the inventor of Roll Culture in Kolkata. If you love true flavor of Kolkata and love to taste Authentic tastes of Kolkata come and try Nizam‚Äôs kathi roll (a fried paratha packed with fried egg, spicy meats , onions and chilis, all of which is rolled up...)

My Rating:-

Biriyani is afterall what I go there for, and to be precise the Beef Biriyani. This place might not have a good ambiance but the food wont let you concentrate on any other thing. Not so costly and ‚Çπ60 is worth paying for the Beef Biriyani.

As summer is approaching, I am eating up as much beef as possible, so Nizam's Mughal Gardens segment definitely features heavily on my list. I have a little soft corner for the Kheeri kabab, and Nizam does it well. Ordered a plate of beef bhuna, 2 tandoori rotis, and a plate of kheeri kabab for myself. My companion was too interested in mutton biryani to care. Our food came in within 5 minutes of order, and we literally lunged for it. The meat in the bhuna was soft, the gravy spicy and exactly what I needed. The tandoori rotis went great with it. The kheeri kabab (half) was exactly as I liked it - chewy yet soft, with a character of its own. My companion was engrossed in his biryani and did not look up (or give me a bite). He grunted once, and ended up with a Thums Up. Our bill was under 300/-  so happiness was all around us.

I have always been a fan of Nizam's, from back in the day when they used to serve beef along with mutton and chicken. Now the beef section has been separated to give Nizam a more mainstream outlook. However, I generally come to Nizam for the mutton boti kabab and tandoori rotis. For me, Nizam's Biryani and Chaap does not hold much appeal, but the kababs do. Also, one other thing I absolutely love doing is taking home a few rolls from here on those days when I am craving a ROLL FROM NIZAM. 

The service is mediocre and the place does have hygiene issues, but a good place for cheap and quick eats around New Market region.

If I write a review on Nizam's, it will be just pure nostalgia. I remember first visiting this place way back in the late 1980's with my parents. My father always used to talk about their beef rolls. But as a school kid, my mom made sure I did not have that. So I first ended up having their mutton roll. The noted difference was in the finishing of the roll as there was no sauces involved. It was just onions n nimbu. The taste just stuck.

Then came the mid 1990's when I was in college. During those days our favourite hangout area was always Esplanade. It had all the options of watching movies with plenty of movie halls. However when it came to food, it was undoubtedly Nizam's. As at that time we had a very limited budget, that was always our only option. We used to look for one of the tables at the inside portion of the restaurant (as those had a big window to look out). The food always used to be good. That time I also fulfilled my wish of having their beef rolls and kababs too.

Now I see many people writing reviews about the food not been good here. Well honestly I have not visited this place in the last 15 years so cant really comment on that. However the experience which I had was very fulfilling in those days. The restaurant had been through many ups and downs (lot of closures due to staff strikes) and yet they have kept their old world charm.

All in all, a place of nostalgia associated with my upbringing in Kolkata!!

A very old restaurants of kolkata & the founder of the KATHI ROLLS (as they claim). I didn't visit the main hotel but had the rolls many times.But i'm utterly dissatisfied. The quality of the roll deteriorate very fast. On my last visit,which was around 20 days ago, we were a gang of 4-5 & all are hungry.So we ordered mutton rolls.But the quality we received was not at all good.The muttons pieces were very small & the taste was not at hi-fi level.It was just ordinary.The paratha was also very thin. So it was not at all value for money & we moved to other places to satisfy our hunger.
But on my earlier visit which was 1-2 months ago, the quality of the same roll much higher. So,please maintain the quality of the roll as this place is known to be the best KATHI ROLLS makers of kolkata.

The Creators of Kathi Rolls in India. Man, you need to be in this place. But I will suggest you to go for the beef, if you don't have any problem with this variety of red meat, of course. Their beef is just too good and they serve all the authentic dishes. Though its perhaps one of the costliest of beef shops compared to Rayaz or other small shops in Anwar Shah or Park Circus, the price is worth it.  A must visit to beefy foodies. ;)

We went to this place after watching film at Roxy as it is near to the hall. We used to visit this place quite frequently during our college days and we enjoyed the biryani here. We went to this place just to have some evening snacks as we already had our lunch at Buzz so we ordered for Chicken Kati Kabab and Mutton kati kabab. Quite to my disappoinment I didnt like the taste of the kababs as they were hard and the masala used in the Kabab didnt mixed properly. Then we ordered firni and it was good in taste. So overall my review collectively for the kababs and the firni will be 3.0

Well, a very old place to start with. 
The birthplace of KATHI ROLLS (as they claims).
The service is good. 
The food served here is moderate, nothing extraordinary.
Mutton biriyani, mutton/chicken chap, nizam's lachcha paratha, mutton rezala, these are few MUST TRY items.
The biriyani is very well cooked. I prefer it over aminia.
Price is reasonable. 
A good place for casual food_outs ( R.I.P English :P )

i could have easily given this place a 2.5/5 thanks to the humble benign attitude of their staff...........huh !!
they are like those cars which have yes my dad owns the road written on them ...........
they have this huge pride of being the pioneers of roll making in kolkata 
i dont care if they have been good at some point of time right now they are like normal ----------- average ------------ if not substandard 
if by mistake you ask for sauce in your roll
they will first stare you with great disgust and with an air of superiority state that they dont serve sauce with their ( exquisite ) rolls.....bah!
i frankly thought the roll was average i have had better rolls at many places
the ambiance is  not where you'd like to take your special ones
but aah there is a specialty here that lulls my taste buds........ and that is the BEEF 
i was elated the first time i realized that beef is cheaper than chicken and so much tastier too 
i knw many ppl are at a moral dilemma whether to have beef or not but that's completely their problem 
i like my beef and i like the way nizam makes it at such a low price ..only 75 for beef pasinda 
the paratha is okay the biryani is quite good all the mughlai dishes are good 
they are loosers at making veg dishes though 
-----------------------------
so beef gets 4.5/5
nizam without beef gets 2.5/5
staff gets 1/5
ambiance 1.5/5

Me and my University buddy M&M (Yeah,she insisted on this weird nickname) dropped by this place on Valentine's week. We had been chaperoning a couple in their first month of love,and were thoroughly sickened by everyone's overtly expressive lovey dovey attitude.Having abandoned the aforementioned couple in Princep Ghat , we two strolled along until we reached this place. I'm no expert,but even naive old me can say this isn't a place for taking out your special one. Ambiance,when out ticking off the restaurants where it's supposed to be, most certainly gave this place a miss. Even the standards of hygiene seemed dubious to me. Which is sad,because a self ordained signboard states that this place saw the birth of kathi rolls. Having settled down,we ordered mutton biriyani,and mutton rezala. The meat was tender and well made,but the overall taste of the biriyani was nothing extraordinary. The gravy in the mutton rezala seemed much too watery to me. Prices are pretty standard here,one can't really complain. Another problem synonymous with other Mughlai joints is the quality of oil/dalda used. But perhaps now I nitpick. Overall,this place no longer lives up to the name and fame it once enjoyed in the old days. Which is sad indeed.

Nizam's - Located Amidst New market or Sir Stuart Hogg Market.

I was walking down the new market and i suddenly discovered the famous Nizam's which many of my foodie's had previously talked about and even heard good things about its own discovered Kathi Rolls in the City of Joy.

As i saw the board on top written Nizam's near the Bihari Eatery, i was immediately struck that well this is that famous 'Nizam's'.

I was a little hesitant to go inside at first because it has a very odd type of environment. I thought it was inside the market first. However, when i took few steps into the Non-Beef Section, there you go. I had reached the Nizam's. However, when i had reached there, the ambience was nothing as such great. There were cats running near the table and all. So, i was a little shocked to see how they are maintaining it and much more hesitant to eat out here.

However, i placed my order : -
1) Chicken Biriyani - The biriyani tasted good. However, in every place i see the potato and chicken less cooked. However, in Nizam i felt the chicken was perfectly steamed and was a big piece but the Potato was overcooked. The oil was again an issue.
2) Chicken Tangri Half- The chutney of the kebab tasted really very different. However, some people may like it and some may not. I preferably did not like it much. The tangri wasn't much succulent but was little on the crispy side.

For me, this is certainly not a place to dine in with your special one. I would prefer a takeaway next time. I would also give a try to their discovered Kathi Rolls.

To sum it up in short,
Ambience - 1.5/5
Food - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5

It is not much costly and cost of biriyani and tangri came to approx 240 bucks.
====
Recently went there and had chicken biryani 19.03.2016. It costed near about 140 bucks and was worth the bucks. However, again oil content was high. Chicken marination could've been stronger. The potato was better than the last time. Well cooked.

One should visit this joint for only two reasons- rolls and beef. In my opinion nothing else can be a motivating factor to drop in. I will explain. For beef eaters- there are not too many options in Calcutta. If one is keen to have beef biriyani, beef kebab, khiri kebab, beef roll etc then as per my knowledge this is the most reputed and safest place to have it. There are a couple of other joints in the Khidderpore & Park Circus area that do serve beef but this place surely holds the numero-uno position in the beef department without any doubt.Moreover joints at the locations mentioned above are also not suitable for families and are strictly all men hangouts.
Secondly how can rolls be bad in a joint that supposedly invented them? Yes people can venture in, take a seat and order their rolls .This is not something that many joints allow, given the fact it is not a high value order. The rolls and they have quite a large array is outstanding. The aroma of the meat as one passes by in front of the restaurant is surely very tempting.
Rest of the items- mutton chaap, tandoori chicken, chicken biriyani, parathas which i have had earlier are strictly okay.Nothing worth going gaga about.
This joint established in 1932- yes , you read it right, has had its share of problems- labour trouble, ownership rivalry and finally has been  bifurcated into two sections-beef and no beef  is still going strong. Though it has slid down the popularity charts to a great extent like many other Mughlai joints it  still manages to attract its own share of loyal patrons and i am no exception.
P.S. Usual disclaimer of food being cooked in dalda and low standards of hygiene apply .:)

My first visit to Nizam was in early 80s, in my college days and the taste of Kheeryie Kabab and paratha still lingers in my mind. It took me a while to do the rating for the restaurant because if I want to rate it against my memories and what it truly used to be before closure, it would have been a case of "give me red" at best. But then, we in Kolkata learn to accomodate and live with things and in that mode, I rate it a green (keeping in sync with the current electoral sentiments). The place looks a bit spiced up but the staff are the same as in the 80s I guess, keeping in mind the pace and attitude. Most of the stuff that we loved before like Kheeri Kabab, Beef Bhuna tac are not served anymore here One has to go nest door to Mughal Garden or Behary Restaurant for that)... alas. The chicken and mutton dishes are pretty ordinary and only the Rolls make a distinct impression. The Veg Roll( which is aactually aloo/potato) is still the best in town and the chicken and mutton rolls with or without egg are pretty delicious too. But then, for oldtimers like me, it will always be akin to a "old days are no more" and one leaves with a heavy heart.

Nizam's as popular lore goes invented the concept of the Kathi Roll. Probably one of the most popular fast foods in the country sadly in between it had closed down and the quality of food had deteriorated quite a lot. After my last experience there which really upset me I simply stopped going. However thanks to Zomato and the reviews that popped up I decided to give it a shot and to my surprise it had shown serious improvement. All I had was the Egg Mutton and Egg Chicken Roll .... munched on them on my way back home and they were quite nice. Its still not the old Nizams but am glad that the rolls are back to being quite good and when nostalgia hits me I can stop by :-)



----- 01 Nov, 2012 -----

The name "Nizam's" and Kati Rolls go hand in hand ..... they pretty much pioneered the concept. Today their rolls are just about OK. The quality of the mutton roll has deteriorated but the chicken roll is not bad , no where near what it used to be though. Its no longer the place I would especially go to eat but if I was hungry and passing by would grab a chicken roll.

So here is why classics remain classics no matter what. Here is why the inventors of Rolls (A flatbread which is shallow fried and stuffed with stuffing and rolled to resemble a roll) are one step ahead of the other famous roll centers of Calcutta. So it was on a cool evening when I was taking my usual walk and had clubbed it with picking up a few items from New market. To be fair I had not really planned to get myself a roll but then the sudden price in extra virgin olive oil within 4 months directed me to this heritage eatery to drown my sorrow in succulent meat encased in a flat-bread which is so soft and yet thin enough with soft moist egg clinging to it and a bite provided by the green chilies that I suddenly became quite forgiving towards the rise in price as well. How does it stay ahead of other establishments, well not to stir a hornet's nest but the kebabs are way more succulent with the right amount of spices etc. The flat bread is soft yet does not droop and the generous amount of egg makes each bite a delight. Plus there is enough meat for every single bite. With the rise in price the price has increased a wee bit and currently stands at Rs40 for egg chicken roll. One of these is sure to make a very heavy evening meal leaving room for a light dinner and with the two rolls that I took delight in having my dinner has been taken care of. The service is as quick as ever. The servers do except a tip but surely when I pay Rs80 for two rolls a mere Rs10 for those beloved people who has maintained this heritage restaurants all these years seem legitimate.                             P.S. I could not eat both rolls at one go and brought it back with me and 30 minutes later it was still warm and soft and succulent but that was just because it was 30 minutes from the time of making the rolls . Rolls are "fast food" hence fast to make and must be taken "fast" If you are going to travel some 1 or 2 hours carrying the rolls and except the flatbread to be as soft and the meat as succulent you will be disappointed.



----- 25 Jun, 2013 -----

Nizams is synonymous with kathi rolls and I have usually always stuck to their rolls and kathi kebabs from their specialty section and have almost never been disappointed. While their kati rolls are still unique in taste and quite delicious the other items are sadly very disappointing. I usually try and avoid oily rolls during the hot season and decided to try the Kebabs for a change. At the take-away section the servers are polite and usually expect a tip and must be appreciated for their quick service but the Reshmi kebab and boti kebabs were both disappointing, the meat was tough and the reshmi kebab was a tad too salty for my taste (I must mention that I prefer my sodium very low which is much more low than an average person's taste) The 'hara' (green) chutney (condiment) even though did have the fresh taste of coriander leaves, chili and ginger it lacked the bite one expects from these spicy condiments , perhaps the addition of salt , lemon and cumin would have rendered it superb. I shall of course wait for the cooler season to bite into their delicious rolls but shall steer clear of all other items.



----- 12 Apr, 2013 -----

As is known by most connoisseurs of food from Calcutta and the rest of the country legend has it that it was in this very place that the kathi-roll had been invented as an easy lunch option for British officer who had wanted a non-messy Mughlai dish. While most Calcuttans swear by a roll  as their favourite junk food it is obviously a winter dish because I cannot honestly find any pleasure in having a thick parantha with fillings of kebabs on a hot sultry day but during the winter time or rather the time when the city happily bids adieu to the unbearable summers this wrapped dish can be enjoyed to its last bit. I have usually found giving instructions to the waiters helpful to create the roll of my taste. My requests are simple, that they not deep fry my parantha and use less onions and more kebabs to which they smile but oblige.  I am not sure if the number of kebabs are increased but I definitely walk away with no greasy roll to be enjoyed at home with a cup of tea. I have had rolls from every corner of the city and while some North Calcuttan joints can very well boast of good quality rolls none can get it right because the kebabs are what add to the taste and Nizam surely knows how to make its kebabs to compliment the paranthas. One roll is enough to ward off your hunger pangs for a couple of hours . It is unwise to expect a healthy roll since no such thing exists and if you want it completely non-oily it automatically transfers to a wrap and would mean that Nizam is not the place for the expectant. I somehow find the uniform of the servers very pleasing and fit for a place serving Mughal food.

We all know about this place they have many braches as well but the roll they offer its out of the world.And the taste does not change with outlets they are as crunchy and juicy as possible.They offer biriyani and mughlai dishes but I am a big fan of thair egg chicken roll.They are sooooooo good because they are the one who invented the recipe.

Tucked away in a corner in Hogg Market, this little joint might not use marketing strategies to promote itself but people who know about this legacy of Nizam's would definitely not miss it for the world.
Recommendation : Beef biryani & beef pasinda.

The beef biryani is the best that i'd  had! Forget the ambience because it is plain and simple, nothing great.
But the beef biryani is delicious. And complimenting is the beef pasinda. Soft, juicy and succulent, the beef pasinda is an absolute treat to the taste buds. Nizam's is usually flocked by people in small groups and the beef biryani is famous here!
Deliciously cooked in rich spice and aroma, the fragrance would literally tickle your nostrils and the taste would simply numb your tastebuds for splitseconds. The spices with which these two dishes are prepared are to die for!

Not very oily yet very tasty, for a sumputuous rich meal you can always visit Nizam's.
Pocket friendly price is another usp : )

But yes, keep the hygiene worm back at your home because this place is basic clean, not crystal clear though!

Happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

Nizam's is one of the heritage places for food in Kolkata.It is one of the oldest Mughlai restaurants in town.At present it may not be the best place for Mughlai,but there is certainly more to this place than just heritage.

Before coming to the food,it has to be mentioned that this place located behind Hogg market in the New market area has two sections.One is the main Nizam's and the other just behind it is the Moghul Gardens section.Both the sections are under the same management and the essential difference between the two is that while the main Nizam's does not provide beef preparations,the Moghul Gardens section does so and thankfully so!!

Nizam's is said to be the inventor of kathi rolls and still today they prepare some of the best kathi rolls in town.The succulent pieces of meat wrapped in some of the best lachha paratha you will find anywhere is an absolute treat.The lachha paratha they use for their rolls is quite unique and quite special.The variety of on offer in the rolls section is also appreciable.Apart from the commonly used combination of egg and chicken or mutton in the rolls,they also offer combinations involving potatoes (aloo).These also are really tasty and I quite like them.For many people it is these delicious kathi rolls that draw them to Nizam's time and again.

Apart from the renowned kathi rolls,the other thing about the place that draws people like me here is the beef preparations.As I have mentioned before,it is only the Moghul Garden section which serves beef products and they do serve some of the best beef in town.The beef is always well cooked and not hard and difficult to chew as in some other places.The beef biryani is reallly nice.The quality of the beef and the rice is always good.The flavour is decent too.The beef bhuna and the beef chap are also quite good.And also not to mention the beef rolls-they are excellent!!

As far as the other Mughlai items on offer here are concerned,they are not the worst by any means.But the quality is not consistent.The biryani is decent.The kebabs especially are a bit of a let down.In short,you will find better elsewhere.But the firni and the kulfi are also really good.The kulfi especially is something I really liked.It is served with liberal amount of falooda and rose syrup and it absolutely melts in your mouth.It is just perfect  and more so after a heavy Mughlai or beefy meal!!

The prices are very reasonable.The beef items and the kathi rolls are absolute value for money!!The service is very very swift.But there is nothing much to say about ambience except that if you are concerned about ambience then this is not the place for you.The aeration and ventilation are not the best.The fans are placed at awkward positions and it is not a great place to visit during summer or during peak lunch hours when its really hot and also very crowded.But there is a small air-conditioned section upstairs which can be missed easily.The price in the ac section is understandably slightly higher.The Moghul Gardens section is slightly less crowded and more cleaner.I do prefer this section more.If you do not have a problem with beef,then this is surely the section for you.Otherwise,if you prefer the main Nizam's,then do stick to the Kathi rolls.

Overall,as is the case with many other heritage eateries,Nizams finds it hard to keep up with the stiff competition from other newer food joints considering the quality of the food,the ambience and the hygiene and cleanliness.But it is the beef items and the kathi rolls (and also the heritage) that are keeping Nizam's alive and rightly so.The beef items and the kathi rolls and the kulfi are worth recommending.

Have been coming to this place since childhood and whenever i come I go for the items the love the most here. 
Ordered Beef Biryani , Khiri Kebab , Lachha Paratha and Firni. Food quality has degraded a little bit . Service quick and ambience satisfactory.

Nizam! One of the oldest mughlai restaurant in town and situated in the new market area of Esplanade is famous for its Kathi Rolls.. Still a hot favourite of mine.. First had it when one of my brother took me there. Personally I think Nizam remains the king of Kathi Rolls.. Yummy!! The chunks of chicken wrapped in laccha paranthas.. Ohh just heaven.. Still today no one matches it.. Finger licking.. Service is very fast.. Infact I think the fastest.. The Beef Biryani of Nizam or Mughal Garden is also really cheap at just Rs 55 and really tasty with good flavours in it. Not much spices with well cooked beef. Just perfect.. Every time I go to Nizam I take Biryani or Kathi Rolls.. Just amazing. Although it is worth giving the Kebabs a try. They are good too.  Then there is the Kulfi which just melts in the mouth.. 

Nizam speaks history and nostalgia. A very old restaurant and located very near to the Aminia restaurant. The ambience again is not worth speaking about although heard there is one ac section too. But never been there.. If you want Kathi Rolls and just want to enjoy it look no further.. Nizam is the place. After all they are the ones who invented Kathi Rolls..

Located near the New Market, opposite to Elite Cinema Hall, off S.N. Banerjee Road, lies the Mecca of kathi rolls, Nizams. This place claims to be the first to introduce kathi rolls in Calcutta, and the taste they offer in their rolls, they might not be wrong at all. An English saying goes like this: Appearances can be deceiving, and this holds fully true for a place like Nizams. The eatery is divided into two portions, one being a take-away counter, while the other is a restaurant where one can sit and enjoy Mughlai cuisine.  The restaurant appears to have been cleaned once a week, but the food is not one bit like the restaurant. Indeed, it is one of the best places to get kathi rolls in the city. And the variety of the rolls is never ending. Starting from the basic paneer roll, egg roll, chicken roll and mutton roll, Nizam also serves other combinations like egg chicken roll, double egg chicken roll, double egg double chicken roll and the Nizams special roll.
Among the roll eaters, there are a few in the adventurous crowd who wish to stretch the limits of what they eat. For them, Nizam offers beef rolls, and my personal favourite in the menu, khirri rolls. Khirri rolls are made from the udder of the cow, marinated in spices and then roasted over coals or a fire in wood skewers. The combination of flavours works so well, that one cannot be content with just one roll. In fact, it is not at all surprising to see customers sitting at the restaurant and gorging on rolls, which is normally considered a take-away food.
If you are a roll lover, do drop into Nizams some day. It surely will not be a disappointment.

Wow, so, famous and completely a heritage place for any foodie. Kathi kebab and paratha, ummmmmmm.... what a combo, real finger licking taste. Rolls are very famous and good too. Hall of fame food. was closed for sometime and I'm so happy that they reopened. They started chains also in other places, though not as good and as tasty as this old original one. Try this out if you have not yet.

Nizam's has been long known for its plethora of Mughlai dishes. From around 1930s this restaurant is suppose to house  some of the best mughlai dishes available in Kolkata alongwith the invention of the famous Kathi Roll. As the inventors, they still make the best kathi roll probably in the whole country and nothing else is matched to it.

Situated quite conveniently in the Hogg market, just few shops from Aminia, there are two sections. The Mughal Gardens and The Nizam's(both under same management). I went there on a Saturday afternoon, but it was already very late and I was quite full. The only purpose to come here was to taste the famous kathi roll.

We ordered Egg  Chicken Roll. Came in quick, hot and amazingly delicious. You will be suprised if you have tried a Kathi Roll elsewhere and then come to this place to try the real ones. Elsewhere I have seen serving kathi rolls in Fried chapatis but here they are Lachcha Paranthas. Its amazing in taste and will keep you finger licking.

We also ordered some kulfi and it came in a pretty different way then expected, with sewai and rose syrup. Believe me, you haven't had such kulfi in ages. 

The place has its old charm but some small shortcomings too. The place is small and can be pretty crowded in festive seasons, but still the place is clean.

Below are the some pros and cons of Nizam's:

Pros:
1. Kathi Rolls to die for, best you can get anywhere in the city.
2. Convenient location
3. Cheap price for the quality they offer.

Cons:
1. Very small place and can be very crowded in festive seasons.
2. If you are looking for some ambiance, please go to some other place.

All in all it is definitely one of the heritage places to visit in Kolkata, which still holds a special place in everybody's heart as a hub of quality mughlai food. And if you are looking for Kathi rolls, you can indulge yourself wildly in the wide range of varieties and never be satisfied.  Must try are the Egg Chicken Roll and Kulfi.  Happy munching!!!

Nizam‚Äôs‚Ä¶ The name itself seems to be synonymous with nostalgia and an age old tradition of culinary wisdom. We have heard true stories of Rabi Ghosh, Uttam Kumar, even Amitabh Bacchan stopping for their midnight snack here.

But UNFORTUNATELY Nizam‚Äôs is not the same. I one read in The Telegraph that the government is planning to shut down this age old place because they haven‚Äôt cleared their tax dues. However, Nizam‚Äôs still stands, but only as a grey shadow of what was once an establishment by its own virtue. They are still proud to proclaim themselves the ‚Äòinventor‚Äô of the kathi rolls, but the sad part is that their kathi rolls, in the present competitive market don‚Äôt stand apart, really.

The other dishes are too oily as usual, the tandoori chicken is often burnt, and there‚Äôs no guarantee of the parantha- sometimes it‚Äôs light and tasty, sometimes it‚Äôs thick, hard and stone cold. Adding to the fluctuating quality is the uneven behavior of the waiters here. Most of these people seem to be arrogant, too proud of Nizam‚Äôs past to focus on the present reputation and quality that the place delivers. 

Do visit this place once, but not for the food- it‚Äôs nothing special anymore, but to feel the nostalgia enveloping this area and to proudly proclaim that you‚Äôve ‚Äòbeen there, done that‚Äô!

This old restaurant behind Hogg's Market is famous for its Mughlai cuisine. It has got two sections, out of which, only one serves beef (the Mughal Gardens). The rolls and biriyani are the two things that one must try out from here. I've also had their beef biriyani, parathas and beef bhuna. The parathas which are priced at Rs. 8 each are just amazingly soft and yummy. For dessert, their earthen plate of firni would be the perfect choice. The taste and quantity of all the items is quite good, given the low prices charged for them.
There is a small A.C. section upstairs which can be easily missed, so one can avoid sitting downstairs if its too hot. Their service is pretty quick. Overall, if you're not too fussy about cleanliness then do not hesitate to drop in and gorge on their savory items. 
P.S : Nizam's is a must visit for any beef lover.

I want to give the 4 rating for food, but when it comes for the overall, i recalled the atmosphere there. Well, the place is quite old and surrounded by the crowd always. You may miss its entrance if the gully is much crowded by the hawkers.
I was new at Kolkata at that time, and my only help was an acquaintance who suggested me for Nizam.
The place says itself that it started from a scratch and it had never thought that it will grow much higher. The congestion was evident.
Biryani was, no doubt, awesome, but i felt the need of something else. I ordered Chicken haryali Kebab and ate with it:).

Good place for take away, dine-in only if you go there regularly, or you dont have any option.

The famous Restaurant at Esplanade beside Futnani Chambers and opposite CMC Headquarters has 2 different sections.

Nizams section : The older part of the restaurant that serves no beef products. Here the first thing you should go for is the Kati Roll, an ubiquitous version of the ordinary roll filled with sizzled chicken which melt in your mouth and rolls in your tongue with spicy fury. Other than that, there's no reason to stay here. Head over to the Mughal Garden section just besides the place for better seating and better serving.

Chakraborty Tip : Beware this server : A middle aged man with a large nose and nearly white moustache and a black long hair. He's as rude as the Devil.

Mughal Gardens Section : The section of the restaurant that stands just besides the original Nizams and which serves beef products. I haven't had the pleasure of tasting most of the delicasies that Nizam is famous for. But they sure can make a sizzling Beef Biryani. Kushka Biryani is another item that you should try. Opposite Chaplin Cinema and the CMC Headquarters, Nizam looks and feels old, but not in a musty way. Its got a Patthani charm with no frills interior and a quick serving staff. The prices are also quite manageable.

Chakraborty Tip : Do not go there in the afternoon, as the place is akin to a furnace. The fans are  placed at awkward angles and the ventilation system is shot to hell. Don't eat if you cant manage a place in the AC first floor.

Nizam's is the first and last name when it comes to kathi kebabs  in Calcutta ...Period.    

Their mutton kathi kebab is to die for .Yes, they do have their off days...but nine out of ten times you will have a great experience,it's not a high class joint so don't expect any fancy ambience..but the pathani clad waiters are always courteous and eager to serve.

Visited the Mughal Garden Nizam (adjacent to the corner Nizam's) which serves beef this afternoon.

Have been here a couple of times before, and the place is not really one you would say is nice to sit. Like any middle quality restaurant without airconditioning and unpolished service :)

We ordered the beef chaap. The pieces were decent, but didn't really taste like the chaap one is accustomed to. Was a tad too salty. Also had the beef kabab, which was in no way like the quality I have had before. The meat had a mild off-putting smell... not bad, but of a spice I didn't quite fathom. Cardamom? The parathas were nice. I like the parathas they serve, being not at all fond of the lachha parathas they serve at most places. Unfortunately they didn't have Thumps Up, so had to settle for a Pepsi.

They actually served cold water instead of room temperature. The place was warm and it helped. Also, there was a door adjacent that was being opened frequently and warm air would come in.

I discovered the AC section a tad too late!

You got to go there to have rolls. Its a must place to go when we are out shopping in New Market area. They have an AC corner in their First Floor. The Ambience is not that high but the quality of their rolls make up for everything.. And you wont believe it when I say that they have one of the cleanest toilets in all the mid level Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata.

the hub of kolkata's mughlai cuisine might have shifted to park circus,yet,the new market area is yet wild on cards when you crave for biryani,tandoor,kebab and roll.there is no point discussing the interior or the quality of service,they actually furnish you with a roof and a seat and that's that.what they do,however,offer  is the salivatory aroma of biryani and the variety of it-hyderabadi,lucknowi,badshahi,etc.. i've found better kebabs and rolls in arsalan.but their biryani would still be one of my favourites.the price is affable,and pocket friendly,so drop in anytime

Beef kabab, lacchha parantha, Halim and rolls. thats what u get best here. One of the old eateries of this city, separated later on into two sections. Has its old world charm, and a decent place to have food near new market after a day of shopping.

ambiance - Hot hot and hot.. old world feel, hygiene issues.

Food - kababs worth it, and the laccha parathas are a bit thin, but neverthless, food tastes good here. Beef halim is decent, but thats seasonal.

Quality - hygiene issues, not so clean as one would want it to be.

service -  is ok ok.. the waiters do turn up. :P

This place is very well known undoubtedly but off late the quality has definitely deteriorated. Its well known for its rolls. But now there are too many snack bars in Kolkata which serve you awesome rolls. The biriyani isn't that nice and chicken chap is average I would say. But yes this place is damn cheap so you wouldn't mind spending to get rid of your hunger. Yes the ambience is not up to the standard and the place seems unhygienic and you will think twice before trying their food.
I will still rate it 3 for its availability and low pricing of food. Go there and expect to have an average experience.

Basically nizam's does not need any great introduction as many of kolkata people are obsessed with it's dishes specially biriyani. But to be honest, I did not find their food very delicious or too mouthful. It was an average experience going to nizam's. Food was ok. I think their roll corners around the city are doing great. Moreover, they need a change immediately to survive in such a booming market.

In this fast-growing and fast-learning world, one can never let complacency take over. Nizam was one of the best places in the city a decade or two back - and they have invented the Kati Roll that you devour in every streetfood stall. But sadly, none of their heritage remains but for a slim chance that you might actually get some of their soft mutton pieces in the Biriyani. The quality of the roll has declined rapidly over the years, and now it is nowhere near the top.

The location is fantastic, bang near New Market. The ambience is nothing to talk about. The cleanliness leaves a lot to wonder about the hygiene of the kitchen. You will not get proper tissues and the waiter will rummage through his pockets for that odd fork if someone enquires.

The biriyani is mostly dry, the kebabs are not evenly balanced on the spices, and if you take more than two gravy dishes, you will start wondering if they have more in common than they ought to.

Verdict: If you are ravenously hungry from shopping at New Market (going out just for dining here makes no sense), then instead of trying Nizam, try the Mughal Garden which is located next to it. It is much better in the quality of the biriyani they serve, especially the beef biriyani.

Nizam's ......I went there because of alluring comments and recommendations by members of Zomato......but , sorry to say.....I found nothing enjoyable there. I had Lachhedar Paratha, Butter Murg and Egg Chicken Roll. The paratha was good to eat and crispy too, but the Chicken preparation was less tasty and too oily to eat. The people, preparing food should know that oil doesn't give taste....hence, too much oil does not enhances the quality of a platter. The "famous" rolls of Nizam's was not at all up to the mark. There are places in Kolkata , where more varied and tastier Rolls are available. And the most prominent part, the staffs , are really worst kind of human I could ever met. They even blocked my exit to grab tips. The restaurant does not accept cards, again a minus point. I would say my friends never to go there unless I visit the place after a couple of years with a fresh mind to review.

I went to this place with a lot of expectation, and boy, was I disappointed! WTH!! Did they really call this shady and not-even-so-clean restaurant the mughlai hub of Kolkata? The tables and chairs are like any of those roadside 'hotel's.. Ordered a plate of kebab, and I had a plate full of grilled mutton pieces, the one you see inside rolls, in my hand. Biryani didn't taste bad.. But c'mon, when you have restaurants like Arsalan and Shiraz in the same city offering theirs at the same price, who'd come here? And finally, to complete my nightmare, the wash basin didn't have water!! I mean, these days, which restaurant don't have water in their taps!! My god!! Poor, to say the least..

Great food, fresh, and a no pretense, no frills attached service.

the rolls r nice, chicken dishes r better than the mutton ones, but during ramadaan, the haleem is sold like hot cakes, if u dont make it in time, be sure to be deprived.

i simply love th double egg double chicken roll.
1 is huge and filling. :)

dont care if this place is not great guns in service, the food compensates for all else. total value for money.

If you like to have beef and are fond of biriyani and kebabs, Kaathi Roll, Beef Roll etc, then Nizam's Mughal Garden is the place for you.... Don't go by the surroundings and the interiors of the place........ just order for a plate of Biryani and kebab.... or smack in some beef rolls there..... You would like it :) .

Nizam is as god it you think it is. Surely. The famous rolls might not be as good any more, but it still is a good eat. The biriyani is also light on your belly.

Note : Located righ next to it is Mughal Garden and is owned by Nizam. If you are a beef lover, go for this place and come out satisfied having hardly spent much for the amount you'll end up having. Beef briyani and bhuna is delicious.

"Really, no AC? Yeah.
No free Wifi zone? Yeah.
No live music, no outdoor seating? Yeah."
That was the conversation between a friend of mine from Bangalore and me, he being all curious about the place he has so much heard about, and got surprised when I informed him how 1947ish the place may seem to him and etc.
That's 'Nizam's' for all of us.

If you are in Kolkata, and want to get the taste of real Tandoor items and authentic Biryani dishes, 'Nizam's' is the place for you. Situated in the Hogg street of the New Market area, Nizam's is as famous among foodies as @Zomato also is, if not more.

The very few times I went there, the Chicken Biryani, along with Mutton Bhuna was the must among the orders. For Beef enthusiasts, this is one of the places in Kolkata, where you will get a wide range of Beef dishes, namely rice based Biryani dishes (including Hyderabadi counterparts) and a wide array of side dishes as well.

The service is good with waitors in traditional white and red turban attires will attend you, and voila, they are fast enough not to make you wait for eternity for your orders to come. In times of hesitation, even they will be too enthusiastic to help you chose the perfect dish on the basis of your needs.

But one thing for sure, Nizam's are never empty. You will see huge numbers of people always going in and out. If you are attending in a team, you will certainly need to wait for sometime before getting seats.
