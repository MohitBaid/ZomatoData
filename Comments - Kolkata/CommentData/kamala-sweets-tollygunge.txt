Kamala sweets is located at Netaji nagar area of tollygauge near post office. I remember them while I was here ehile visiting a friends place nearby. We came down for breakfast and had kochuri and sabzi which was quite nice. Also tried some rosogolla as well. An usual average sweet shops with good variety along.

One of the oldest sweet shops at netaji nagar, this place serves good sweets if not amazing ones. The kochuri torkari served in the morning is delicious, so is the kheerer chop and jalebi. If one has a sweet tooth, this place is a must try.

One of my relatives bought me a packet of sweets from kamala sweets. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to try their delicious sweet. 
Ladoo has always been my favourite. It was really tasty and made of ghee. 
Yummy.

Located at Netaji Nagar junction, this place is almost iconic and synonymous with Netaji Nagar. Been frequenting this store ever since I was a kid, the sweet is good if not great. The Misti Doi and morning Kachuri Torkari is great. Jalebi is good too. They have opened few more outlet as branch but the one at Netaji Nagar more remains the iconic and most popular one.

Been here done that! Been to this place quite a lot of times, and didn't have any problem with the food quality. The sweets are really good. And as the pricing goes, this place is really affordable! Thumbs up from my side, keep up the good work.

A legendary and old sweet shop located near Netaji Nagar Bus Stand. Used to be regular here once. Was addicted to their Kheerer Chop and Mishti Chop. The quality they still maintain is high and the price tag is low. Better than any other sweet shops around.

the old sweet stall of that are. located near Netaji Nagar bus stop. Rasogullas were pretty good. so as the vegetable chop. But for me the show stopper was "Khir Kanti".
khir kanti was a treat to the taste bud. Probably the best I had during my kolkata days. And its price is low compared to other sweet shops.
