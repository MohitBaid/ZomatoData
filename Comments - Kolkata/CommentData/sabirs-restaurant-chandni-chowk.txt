An old school interface with one of the best mughlai tastes in town. Been there several times. Chicken Rezalla and Rumali Ruti are my favorites.

Sabir restaurant needs no review. Whoever visited this place knows this restaurant is not for the sophisticated food connoisseurs of Kolkata. This is a hidden gem at the heart of Kolkata which is heaven for pure mughlai food lovers. From brain curry to goat legs and even goat tounge masala is available here. Try whatever u like if u don't want to pressurise your brain. Just go for the Rezala with Tandoori Roti which is a specialty here. Try the brilliant Mutton Biriyani too. Firni the special desert of Mughlai khana is awesome too. Not too sweet just the perfect taste. Arsalan and Aminia will be out of business if Sabir comes out in the open biriyani competition. Food is cheap. No beef is sold here. Only mutton and chicken. Visit this hidden gem of Kolkata and thank me later. Cheers !!

Located 5min walk away from e-mall. This is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata selling Mughlai. I’ve been fond of their rezala and chaap since childhood & I always opt for that in my every visit. Over years their quality remained the same. They make my every visit worthwhile.

Sabir's 'Mutton Rejala' is so delicious that it can't be described in words. Simply wonderful. Mutton Rejala with Tandoori Roti is probably the most popular item to order here. Also, you can try Rejala with Biryani. Sabir's Biryani is popular too.

Sabir..the old favourite. Still the rezala tastes the best. We ordered biriyani also though it did not meet upto our expectations. Rezala and naan still rules.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata located 5 mins away from E-mall. I heard a lot about this restaurant and had high expectations. The decor and service is here is average, nothing special about it. The food on the other hand tasted very good. This place serves classic Mughal food at a very reasonable price. The Mutton rezala is the best I have had in Kolkata and would definitely recommend this dish to everyone. Would definitely come back here a second time !

The look and feel of this place is still so authentic and real it's still exactly how an Irani restaurant used to be from the decors to look to feel to serving style and the staff as well.
The staffs behavior is very much mood based.

This is not at all a pocket pinching place very reasonable but what disappointed me so much was the food from which I had high expectations

Tandoori roti- a kind of a roti which is served warm and has a nice smell to it and is very soft but what I got was nothing like that what I got was cold and rubbery, could barely tear it and was very chewy

Chicken Chaap-on first look it will look very good and rich but when you taste it, to my surprise it tasted sweet I have never had a chicken chaap which is sweet any where ever.

Chicken biryani-not so great in flavour nothing special very average barely passes to be a biryani

Whenever I am in Kolkata I make it a point to eat Sabir's Rezala at least once. So when I was there last month after a gap of 6 months I was promptly present for dinner at Sabir.  Unfortunately the old Rezala is no more - the dish I got was no comparison to their original.  The meat was tough, the spices overly sweet - what a disappointment.
I fervently hope that this was an off day for the cook or that the regular cook was on leave.  The roti was its old glorious self - in fact the 4 stars are for the roti

After a long walk finally we reached our destination. It was a more or less decent place. And coming to the food we had the famous Mutton Rezala alongwith parathas. The mutton was very tender. Had heard about this place since a long time, known for their Mutton rezala. It was quite a good experience to savour the tastebuds.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time! 
We ordered their Rotis (which are my favorite), Chicken Rezala, Chicken Bharta and Mutton Biryani. The best part about them- all of their chicken and mutton dishes have extremely succulent and melt in mouth pieces which shows that most of their dishes are slow cooked. 
Their bharta turned out to be my favorite. The biryani wasn't too bad but there was nothing to write home about it. 
Cons- excessive use of dalda. They prefer you chomp down their food hot so that one can't see the pile of lard freezing atop your food. 
I did really like their firni though.

Chandni Chowk is that part of Kolkata which I would frequent during my Presidency College days. Sabir's is old world charm. There’s nothing fancy or glittery about this place. The only reason why people still choose to flock to this place in huge numbers is because of the food and nostalgia. Please visit this place if you would love to see what Calcutta used to be long back. Just a word of advice – it is better to try out dishes they are famous for else one might end up getting disappointed. Like roti is always recommended compared to biriyani and the rezala here is definitely a must have item.

Ordered mutton biriyani, that was awesome and even the mutton are very much soft. Then ordered chicken rejala which was also mouth watering. And then ordered chicken chap but that was average. Moreover if u neglect the ambience and go only for food then this place is worthy of a visit.

One of the oldest places selling Mughlai dishes, this one is a must-visit if you are not very finicky about the "decor" factor! No wonder, it is being referred to as a heritage place by most food lovers. Would visit again soon :)

Well everyone is aware of their world famous Mutton Rezala. I also went to have the same. Started with Chicken Tandoori which was very good and the perfect starter. Tandoori Roti was excellent and very fluffy. The Rezala however tasted a bit sweet but the mutton was very soft and very well cooked. The Chicken Bharta gravy tasted much better than the Rezala and was very tasty. The Firni was also good and tasted like grinded cashew. I would definitely recommend their Chicken Bharta.

Wow ... just woww... nothing else comes to my mind. after a long day of work near chandni chowk, me and my wife didnt have many options nearby and we decided to go to Sabir’s around 7 PM for dinner. dont go for the interiors of the restaurant. what matters is the quality of food and the food u get here is to die for. freshly baked naam and chicken bharta and mutton biriyani... was so so tasty... i wished the food may never finish. everything was fresh not like the rotten and days old chicken served by the five star restaurants sometimes. i wish they opened up near my home too in newtown. but anyways, Sabir’s is a rare diamond with respect to the quality of food. loved it. im taking away half stars for the interior and exterior surroundings.

1.Chicken Reshmi Kabab - properly salted and good in taste.  But not that juicy as u expect it to be. 
2. Chicken Tikka Kabab- This is the best dish here.  Awesome tasty n juicy pieces.  Properly flavored. 
3. Shahi Tukra- Another famous dish from here and a hot cake sell one.  
Other than this tried their Tandoori Roti, Mutton Kassa, Paneer Butter Masala. All tasted so so.

This one is located in a busy lane of Chandni Chowk. Took parantha , their famous mutton rezala and shahi tukra. Decor and ambience is not at all impressive. But the food they serve is finger licking good. Mutton rezala, which this place usually boasts for, is extremely tasty. Though the mutton was little chewy but other than that this dish is worth mentioning. I never had this amazing rezala anywhere. Next comes the shahi tukra and oh my god ,this one is also finger licking good. Perfectly fried bread with Malai which is absolutely delicious. Was absolutely in love with it. This place surely deserves many more visits.

Ordered their famous tandoori roti and chicken chap. The place was crowdy and the ambiance was moderate, a bit untidy to be precise. I went there with my dad so I am going to write this review according to his judgment since he has visited this place a lot in his primetime and shared his nostalgic views with me. The first thing that came to his mind is " it is not the same restaurant he has visited. It has changed a lot. Foods are being served of very lower quality nowadays. The chicken chap(the story of which I have heard from my childhood) has lost its charm totally." Now, according to me, the chap was really oily and unhealthy with a piece of chicken which was a little bit undercooked. I didn't like the taste of it at all. The gravy was so thick and the taste was so blunt, it literally nauseated me. The very essence of chap was missing somehow. We came back unsatisfied with the experience, a very big disappointment from my father's side.
P.S. keep some spare change for antacids.

If you know Chandni E-Mall, then place it on your right side & move forward. Take first right from E-Mall & walk 2mins; Sabir's a senescent resturant will be on your left.

Ambience is good, clean & decor wise it is very basic. Service wasn't good at all it was on time but the behaviour of the waiter was not good. When I asked him the price of mughlai he told me go outside & to watch the price rather saying the price.

We ordered their special mutton rezala & tandoori roti. The roti was stiff & rezala was avg. It wasn't a special rezala for me after taste it.

* We made our lunch in the Non-AC zone & there GST wasn't applied.
They also have a AC room to serve food.

This mughlai restaurant has been long revered as a legendary food joint,because of the tasty food it has come to serve and the stretch of time it is in the business.But none should expect catchy decor or glamorous interior design here.Though they have an air conditioned section also,but nothing else.During the daytime parking cars is an painful job,since the area is congested.Now come to the food,their mutton rezala and various kebabs are mouth watering and I can vouch that no one would complain about the quantity.Parathas and rotis are fantastic for their crispiness.Deserts also taste superb.
But if one is looking for a mughlai breakfast like a pathan,folks please wake up someday early in the morning and rush to Sabir's.Try their mutton kalezi(goat lever),magazh(goat brain),and in winter days of course mutton paaya(trotters).I bet there could be nothing better than those.All the food prices are moderate.
So the next time I drop in Sabir's,may be you will be enjoying your time out there.

It's a well known place at chadni chowk.. behind the e-mall.. a bit difficult to find though.. difficult to park cars because the roads are very congested and they don't have a dedicated parking area..
Food is ok..not bad..price isn't cheap I would say.. service is ok too... They have two separate area.. a non-ac section on the ground floor and an ac section on the first floor.. I was with a group and there wasn't enough accomodation at that moment so sat at the non-ac section only.. ordered biriyani which wasn't bad but the mutton peice was really small..
I was almost satisfied when I found a cat strolling near my legs and moving around the whole place under the tables.. when we asked the waiter to get rid of it he seemed not to care at all.. 
Also had tea...which wasn't bad either but like the biriyani it wasn't anything great

Well with all those elegant beautifully decorated places running the main market of food industry its time to look at some of the heritage competitors who still maintains some good image in the public forum .
This place is off the hook ....one of my favourites ...a place with outstanding ,mouthwatering food .
Fresh meat, soft and the  dishes seems to be sometimes spicy and tasty.
One who walks down the lane can smell and say its sabir restaurant cooking some good food .
Its a automatic thrill to taste something so good and delectable .
Try the kebabs, chicken butter masala , biriyani ....everything in the meat world( barring beef) ....is available in sabir ...so dont think just try it out this puja .

Given a legendary status by many, this place is a typical Mughlai restaurant serving typical Mughlai delicacies. This place is very easy to find. It's situated in a busy old street at Chadni Chawk. After extensive shopping spree with a friend of mine, she kind of forced me to visit this place. After waiting for a while, we finally managed to get a seat. 

The seating area is very ordinary and is non-AC. They have AC section too. We chose the non-AC one, as it was quite comfortable after the rains. The general look and feel was clean but there was something dull about the whole place. The waiting staff were mostly old timers. They had a transactional approach - very binary. We were granted a smile as we paid a tip at the end & also on few occasions when we were ordering extra dishes one by one. 

We started with Mutton tikia. The tikia turned out to be very dry. It had too much piling to reduce the cost I suppose. We then ordered what Sabir boasts for ages - Mutton Rezala. It's a mutton preparation that is quite unique in it's texture & flavour. Pale to look but impressive to taste. Though I had better rezala from other parts of this city, still the one's at Sabir's was impressive too. Now no rezala is complete without tandoori roti. Rotis were fluffy and crispy.

After we were mildly satisfied with the rezala & rotis, we moved on to Mutton Kasha. This surprisingly turned out to be much better than it's predecessor. It's gravy had good chunks of meat and the aroma & flavour was quite good. But what is the importance of mutton kasha if it isn't served beside a plate of Mutton Biryani. The quantity of biryani was huge (enough for 2 hungry souls). The quality is okay-ish. 

We Bengalis are renowned for our sweet tooth. Today was no exception! After stuffing our bellies with enough meat, we ended out lunch on a sweet note in the form of Shahi Tukda. And this little baby was the star of the day! The sweetness, the malai everything was too perfect. A perfect end to not-so-perfect meal.

The restaurant is in overcrowded lane, but inside we can witness a traditional atmosphere. The waiters are old, but good. We are dissappointed when we found the kebabs will not be served due due some problem in the ovens. 
The biriyani is good, so as the mutton kasa and tandoori roti. There is no handwash or liquid soap at the basin.

Located in the dingy,overcrowded lanes of the Chandni Chowk stands Shabir's.
Visited this place for the second time,after a span of 3years during the Ramzaan month to have of the specialities of the season-THE HALEEM.
But unfortunately,arrived bit earlier and it hadn't been prepared as yet so decided to go for the Chicken bharta,one of the best items and roties to go with it.
Ended the meal with the all time favorite phirni.

Will keep going back to this place because they never disappoint.
Neither with the food nor with the friendly behavior of the staff.

'HERITAGE MUGHLAI...' Well if you are in Kolkata and you are craving for Rezala... then Sabir's will definitely be at your rescue. It's their speciality... which they have never compromised over the years. I had ordered #chicken_reshmi_kebab #chicken_tikka_kebab #shahi_tukda and ofcourse our guest of honor... #mutton_rezala along with parathas and naan. The service was very quick. We didn't even had to wait. The food was too delicious... It was a delight to our taste-buds...  Well to categorize my review I would say:

Pros : 1. The  service (really quick)
2. The food (too tasty)
3. The price (very much pocket friendly)
4. Location (near Chadni Chowk Metro Station, behind E-mall)

Cons : 1. The decor (It is a two storey building with ac and non-ac floors, the ac one is less chaotic, but both have gloomy wooden decor and age old clumsy ambience. This should be re-innovated.)

My recommendations : Mutton Rezala, Shahi Tukda and any of their kebabs... Yummy! Enjoy!!

had a horrible experience, never will i go again. Bloody stupid staff, manner-less, down-market staff. Serving horrible food, i had ordered for butter naan which was raw and inedible and Mutton Rezala which was not at all soft and extremely hard. We requested them to change it, but the bloody cashier called us a liar as according to him it was fine. He called us liars, and did not change anything. Rather behaved so rudely, and made us pay for the food which we could not even touch.

One of the oldest restaurant in kolkata. Famous for its Rezala. Visited many times and it never disappoints us.
Quick service.
Staff's behavior is very polite.
We ordered Mutton Rezala, Tandoori Roti and Gazar ka Halwa.
Quality of food is very good, they will give one big piece of mutton which is well cooked,tender,and very tasty.
Tandoori Roti was equally good , spongy.
Gazar ka Halwa is also one of the significant recipe here. The flavour and smell of ghee was delicious!
And  lastly we ordered Malai and Coke.
I will surely recommend you to visit this place.

We ordered plain nun,mutton chanp and egg mutton Biriyani...

Nun and mutton chanp was awsm....I think it is the best mutton chanp in the town....

Biriyani also tasted good...quantity adequate...mutton- Well cooked soft and nice ,contains one pieces of potato and one egg....

Price very reasonable....
It was just an awsm experience...

Value for money. Quantity is good. Those who want to eat at a quite and hassle free place this is perfect.

Very poor service! The behaviour of the waiters are very bad.

I ordered :
1.Chicken Rezala: As this dish is supposed to be the best one over here. White gravy based chicken. Good in taste. Goes well with any kind of Indian Bread.

2. Chicken Tandoori Full: A full roasted chicken. Not at all good. Very dry, not juicy! Over roasted. Served in a bed of onions and cucumbers which is unecessary in my view.

Chairs and tables need to change immediately. Cabins are goofy and not clean. Not at all recommended.

I went there with my friends and ordered chckrn biriyani and chicken tikka kabab. The food was quite good. The quantity of the biriyani according to me was a bit on the lower side. And the kabab was a bit hard and dry. It could havr been more soft and juicy. Overall the food and experience was nice.

Visited Sabir's again. Here is my review for the secong visit.

Ordered mutton rezala, tandoori roti and chicken biriyani.
Average food quality compared to the popularity it has in the market. The price is on the higher side. Ambience is also not very great. And the biggest disadvantage is they don't accept cards.

Overall i am not very satisfied with the service and quality of food.

I wish I could give zero rating but that's not a possibility. I have been hearing people raving about the mutton rezala of this place since time immemorial. So, finally, today I had the opportunity to taste their signature dish along with a plate of mutton biryani and a plate of chicken chnaap. Coming to the rezala, calling it aweful won't do justice to that runny gravy torturing my olfactory nerves and taste buds with its stale odour. Actually, it was less of a gravy and more of a spoonful of gravy-ish matter lying beneath the pool of dalda. The size of the mutton was below average and I simply couldn't stand its stale taste. The biryani was better compared to the rezala but wasn't worth 155 bucks. I bet you could get better biryani for 80 bucks or less at certain roadside biryani stalls. The chicken was for my dad so, I only tasted a spoonful of the gravy and it tasted, no prizes for guessing, awefully weird. It was a takeaway otherwise I would have asked the person in charge of the restaurant (?) (not hotel bro, not hotel!) to take those dishes back! It must have been a legendary eatery in its heydays but today was certainly not one of them. The quality of the food might just have dropped drastically low. If you are reading this review while trying to figure out whether this place is worth a visit or not, please don't! If you're short on money, better go and eat at a roadside joint. Kolkata has no dearth of hidden gems.

This was my first visit to this place. Had read a lot of good things about them and the food provided them to be true. Opted for the non - ac section downstairs as the ac section opens only at 1p.m.
Ordered tandoori roti, mutton rezala, mutton kassa followed by phirni and shaahi tukra.Tandoori roti and mutton rezala made a terrific combination. Special mention to the shaahi tukra which was delicious.Though we did not like the kassa much after having the rezala.
Pocket pinch on the lower side. All this cost us only 419 rupees. A place to definitely worth visiting for non-vegetarian food lovers if in the chadni chowk area.

Some places brings out some of the best memories and becomes a part of your growing up.Sabir for me,is one of that special places.Growing in a suburb,visit to kolkata would never been completed without a lunch in aminia,sabir or royal.This is the place where my taste buds fall in love with the whitish,sweet and sour,curdy taste with a hint of spices and keora of rezala.My standard order here remains always the same,piping hot tandoori roti with chicken or mutton rezala.The rezala always comes up with a big,whole red chilli floating on the gravy,squeeze it up a bit to cut the sweet taste a bit,soak the bread into the gravy and you are into mughlai heaven.Finish it up with a rich,milky masala tea and you are done with a visit to old Kolkata nostalgia.P.S if you are hygiene savvy,don't eat there,rather pack it.

Sabir's hotel's Chicken Tandoori was too good from outside and inside and very much pocket friendly(240/-  full). I love specially their "chatni/sauce" with it. 
Their service was too good. Ambience and very quick delivery. 

I recommend all Tandoori lover. Please give it a try. :)

Unlike today, in 90's and early 00's, fine dining in Kolkata meant Park Street, and biriyani meant Central and North Kolkata. Both have now spread across the canvas of the city. Many a new places have made a name for themselves, but I still prefer and rate Shabir way ahead of the rest. The quaint setting of the place is charming (I hope they dont refurbish it)...the cabin, chicken biriyani with mutton chap, a tandoori roti to wipe off the last traces of gravy, and a firni to help everything settle down..a magic the trendy set up of new age resturaunts cant replicate (for sake of ambience) nor capture.

Needless to say that this is pilgrimage for foodies in the city of joy! A humble culinary destination serving delicious mutton rezala, haleem and other delicacies for ages, Sabirs lets you get a feel of the old age charm in this part of the city. 
We were pampered with this khanadani mughlai cuisine comprising of chicken chaap, mutton rezala and the best firni in town!
On a previous visit, I indulged my tastebuds with haleem during the holy month of Ramzan.

With so much of new and happening restaurants, gracing the platter of foodies, Kolkata still boasts of a humble yet the baadshah of mughlai cuisine - Sabirs.

This was my first visit to the legendary sabbir's. People say the quality have degraded a lot with times and the tough competitions by other biriyani restaurants.
Ambience : we went to upstairs in the AC condition rooms but the heat was so much that we merely felt the AC. Sabbir's have small private rooms That are fully covered respecting other's privacy. 
Food : 
Biriyani was too good. Not spicy and very light. The mutton was succulent and coming to the aloo , it was soft 😍
Tandoori roti with mutton rezella, they say are the Best among Kolkata and they truly were tasty.
Chicken Lagan is the new dish introduced by sabbir's. It's more or less similar to chicken chap but the masala is heavenly.
Firni, Malai and shahi tukda were just fine.

After like 6 or 7 years me along with my mom and dad decided to visit this place for lunch once again. To be honest this time it was a disaster. We ordered mutton biryanis as usual .. Well .. The meal was far from being properly cooked let alone being tasty. The mutton pieces weren't boiled properly .. Even they were just the tendons or ligament parts or something. The rice lacked the aroma the flavour. It simply did taste like steamed rice. And here's what happened the time we did complain .. We were simply neglected being told that we should have said that earlier and no other response was given. Even I felt the attitude was uncalled for. Later on we did order some chicken kebabs and they were delightful. Still a place famous for biryanis which doesn't make proper biryanis .. It was far from a proper lunch.

This wonderful eatery has long been pending in my wish list. And now, once been there, its really tough to avoid its call. The mutton rezala and the tandoori roti are a perfect couple. The rezala still matches their unique taste as described by others. However I liked their chicken chaap better, accompanied with mutton biryani. Without  making a hefty blow on your pocket sabir's treats you to a wonderful dining experience. And for all the couples out there, they even have cabin system on the floor above. ;)

When you walk in here do not expect a fancy decor and exquisite ambience as found in modern restaurants.Come here mainly for the food which is of A++ grade as it were.The mutton rezala is the best in Kolkata,no exaggeration here.Pair it with the butter naan,you could almost feel in the seventh heaven..The place jas two floors.The ground floor is mostly a basic eatery.The 1st floor however is equipped with air conditioning and also boasts of a private cabin system which is a bliss and adds up on the cozy factor giving you privacy to eat in peace away from prying eyes.The staff is extremely courteous.The washroom arrangement is not there which is a great minus.

Amidst the chandni chowk market it is a medium sized joint. Heard a lot about its biryani therefore went for it. We ordered 2 mutton biryani, 1 chicken chap and 2 firni.
The biriyani and chap was too good but the firni was below average. On a whole price was reasonable but the ambience not so good since the place is too crowded.

Cool, spacious place in Chandni Chowk. While it doesn't have the ambience generally preferred these days, it's made for people who understand that food trumps ambience. And that does happen here. 

The tandoori rotis are big and soft. The chicken rezalla had a lot of dalda but was lip-smacking delicious. My father, who just had tea, said it was really good as well. 

Just like olypub, the waiters are gruff but respectful. No complaints there.

Sabir is still maintaining its reputation for awesome North Indian dishes. We went last week for a birthday party and ordered our favorite kebabs with tandoori roti, chicken chaap and mutton rezala. I found the chicken chaap a bit less salty, but otherwise all the dishes were mouthwatering. You may not find the ambience cozy enough to hang out with your loved one, but if you are looking for tasty foods then this is the perfect destination.

My visit to Sabir's Restaurant was on numerous occasions and each on varied recommendations ranging from Biryani to Rezallas. However, my visit started with non-recommended items which was handpicked by my not-so-good self ;)

Located on Chandi Chowk, just in the hub of electronics, this restaurants runs its business well and continues to do so without compromising on the quality. It is a standard sized restaurant with plain tables placed with wooden chairs tucked into it. The staffs out here are monotonous, non-friendly but polite enough to acknowledge your requests.

On my first visit to this place, three years back, I remember visiting to this place couple of my friends. We ordered for Chicken Tandoor with Rotis which was delivered quite quicky. It was served with freshly cut onions and coriander chutney which was finger licking good. The Chicken Tandoor was crisply fried in fire and was suitably treating my taste buds; the taste of which still lingers my brains. The meal was quite surprisingly followed by a cup of tea each and well I really liked the mil tea. It was really thick and taste of tea was quite good. However, the sweetness was little on the higher side.

On many subsequent visits to this place, I tried rezallas, firni, haleem, but, yet to catch up with the biryani. The firnis are good; the rezallas are better but the haleem is so-so and not extraordinarily great.

Qs) Should you visit this place?
Ans) A must visit, if you are a non-veg lover.

Qs) What should you try out here?
Ans) I would recommend you to try Chicken Tandoori, Rezalas, Chaaps, Reshmi Kebab among any other menued items. But, before leaving the place do make sure to have a sip of tea and a taste of firni. On Ramzan month, they sell Haleem which can be tried too.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) This place scores cent percentage on taste as well as satisfaction. Their prices are reasonable and in no way can it be termed costly. The staffs are fine but need a bit of orientation. However, cleanliness remains an issue which needs to be improved. Taking all these factors in mind, I have rated them 4.5 stars.

Believe me people, this Palace dont serve the best mutton rezala. Infact they got the recipe all wrong, making it over sweet, somwhat mutton roshogolla. More over the ambience is like a railway station. This is just a relic of old days with no charm left.

So this place is famous for its special mutton rezala. Already heard a lot about its popularity but cant get that much speciality on that particular dish. Got some weird taste. Dont know why, might be it because of different taste level. Rather in my opinion mutton kalia or mutton kasa taste better. Tandoori roti is bit normal not that much soft. Overall can put the restaurant in comparison with the ordinary roadside restaurant.

Sabir's is a legendary restaurant considering that this is the very place were Rezala was made for rhe first time anywhere and the rest is history. I decided to pay it a visit recently when i was around with a friend in Chandni Chowk area. We stuck to the ground floor section which doesn't have A/C and ordered Tandoori Roti, Mutton Rezala, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka Kebab. First off, the Rezala stayed true to it's reputation and didn't disappoint. One bite of the tandoori roti dipped into this gravy can make you forget all the worries in the world. It's that good. I tasted the Chicken biryani from my friend and found it to be light and more flavorful than it's counterparts. Definitely underrated. The Chicken Tikka Kebab was good too. Overall this place is as good as it can get in Calcutta. If you are looking for some good Mughlai and can ignore the ambience part, then pay this one a visit otherwise opt for takeaway. The only downside here being that they are still stuck to the Cash only payments.

This place is famous for Mutton Reazala and Tandoori roti since eternity. Situated on a very congested street of Chandni Chowk, Kolkata, tjis place is always full of people. They provide both A.C. and Non A.C seating arrangement and even personal cabins if you want a little privacy. I tried out Chicken Tikka Kebab as starters,it was one of the best kebabs I have ever had. For main course we had mutton rezala and tandoori roti. Needless to say it was just great as usual. Ambience is very regular. Pocket pinch is very less. I would lastly want to say that the staffs are very good and polite and they may be less posh but they will touch your heart.

This is located in the heart of chandni. The interiors will take you back into the 90s. It gives an impression of the old calcutta. I went with a group of friends in the morning. Ordered for mutton rezala,dal gosht and mutton stew along with tandoori roti. All of them tasted fabulous but the rezala just stood out.later i got to know that this place is known for its rezala and is a must try. I am glad we ordered it. Service is quick and the staffs are courteous. The entire affair was easy to the pocket too. So overall a lovely experience . Would recommend this to everyone looking for a muslim style breakfast!!!!

Another place visited and woof! What a food it was, now talk about their ambience...it was good and clear nothing much to be noticed, talking about their staffs..not good at all, they are like"vai jaldi khao air jao". Let's talk about their food, I've ordered famous "sabir special mutton rezala" and "tandoori roti", speaking about their main course the gravy was really thin, but when they just served it, aroma was like oh my god! This is it, taste was like that only, real good, Roti's was also very good, but only one thing I didn't like about their gravy containing a bit raw flavour of curd, rest of that was hot!

Being a true Calcuttan, I have been a lover of food and stories of the yesteryear.
I heard a lot about this legendary place, which used to be so popular among the people for it's mughlai dishes. But with the passing of generations, and with the arrival of so many new eateries not many people know about this restaurant.
Well, even today I guarantee that you'll get good pocket friendly food in a very good quantity if you give this place a try!
The rezala, chicken bharta is a die for! Even the butter nan and kebabs are absolutely succulent. And for biriyani, I'd proudly say that it's one of my favourite place.

Serving food for decades, close to a century , this place delivers the dishes to its perfection. Located at the left corner as you take left from central avenue crossing the chandni chowk more. What should be called as khandani musalman khana- this place defines it. The mutton rezala is a must try. No one can match that. I even liked the chicken chanp- a very very tasty gravy. And strangely, the way they make a simple tandoori roti- so soft and succulent- people should learn from them. Firni again the best. A pkace to come again and again- like a heaven.

Sabir's has been serving food for around 75 years !!! No mean feat in the extremely competitive Restaurant business. This place opens its doors around 6.30am for breakfast.. The favourites are Paaya with Roti, or Kaleji with Lachha Paratha (which is what I had). The Lachha Paratha has a bit of sweetness in it, and goes quite well with the Milk Tea.. If you have an adventurous streak in you, and a strong stomach that can handle heavy Non Veg food early in the morning, this place is a must try for Breakfast.. Ofcourse they are also open during the day, serving Lunch and Dinner.. but then, whats so adventurous about that !!

I never plan my food but it happens with my mood. Sabir got one of my biriyani wala mood visit. True to my biriyani taste, Sabir disappointed. We ordered Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chap. Pieces of Mutton were smaller than other places. Surrounding are not apt for friends outing or family visit. I found couples and single men mostly. That charm which goes with the reputation, is lost. I don't want to visit again as I felt awkward.

Tried their Butter naan , mutton rezala & firni. Naan was soft and well made. Mutton rezala was spicy & superb with soft & juicy meat pieces. Firni was delicious.

Overall a nice place to dine in.

I went to the restaurant after I read a blog at tripigator about top restaurants  of Kolkata . The writer was all praises about the great Mutton Rezala they make .
Looks like the blogger has no taste buds 
Never eaten such a pathetic mutton dish in my life .
Could not eat it and had to leave after few bites 
Another thing about the restaurant is that no bill was given , there is no online payment mode and payment is by cash only .
Looks like owner don't believe in paying taxes .
Don't waste your money going here

Sabir used to be our one and only stop after watching a movie at Inox hind. Reasonable yet tasteful food is available at Sabir's. 
Special mutton biriyani: not dry, served with one aloo, two mutton pieces and one egg. I would rate it as 3.5/5
Mutton kosha: 4 pieces of mutton in a rich gravy. Enough for 2 people. Rating it as, 3.5/5
Tandoori Rotis: soft and not burnt. 
Overall satisfactory. 
The restaurant is very old and the decor is shabby. Ambience would be a 3/5 for me.

An age old Mughlai Restaurant which has now lost its charm. This used to be one of the most priced and hyped restaurant in and around Chandni Chowk. The first time I had dropped by here, the Mutton Biryani and Rezala was fantastic. A sheer foodgasm experience. Well that was nearly 10 years back. The quality these days have gone down horribly. The Biryani does not taste good and the Rezala too has lost its charm. The only good thing which remains is the economical pricing and the nostalgia which is associated to Sabir's.

since when you are a diner here?i am here from 1987,that is nearly 30 years!and ate here nearly 50 times since then.not too often,you will say.but that has a valid reason.with time,many things with saabirs have deteriorated.the frugal quantity,steep price,a bazaar like noisy ambience,tip hungry waiters have contributed to it.yes,its decline has been witnessed by me.you wont see the crowd that used to be here a decade back.true,many mughlai eatery has come up in every neighbourhood of kolkata.but the original has its own pull factor which has loosened.every time i go there for casual dining,i have to shell out a hefty amount for a food that would have been tummy filling elsewhere.food is average with all thse standard recipes available.go there if the name still buzzes in your nostalgia,as does mine.but it is no longer a hot joint it used to be.and it leaves a trail of sadness,yes,in my heart,as its memory moves around my college days in nearby medical college.

Its a very simple restaurant with moghlai as its specialties , have been visiting this place since childhood & still love their laccha paratha and rezala ( the best in town , must try) . The ground floor is generally for walk in crowd and the upper section is for family ( a.c section) . They serve some seriously lip smacking dishes , like their biryani as well. Its on the budget , its a no frill type restaurant . If you visiting chandani just drop in and try for yourself. The chaps are on the oily side but who cares just dig in them.

Shabir’s is located in chandni chowk of kolkata. The restaurant was dirty .There was no decor at all.Normal dhaba style chair table and hostile walls.Floors were dirty
They serve north indian food. We ordered mutton biriyani only.Service was quite fast.Mutton is their speciality and they serve it really tasty.mutton pieces were very soft and very nicely cooked with lots of masala.Quantity was extremely good but Rice quality was not at all Good. Small sized broken rice. Hardly had any flavour of Biriyani. I had a bad experience because of Quality of Biriyani Rice. Plain Steamed Rice would better I guess if don't take the Mutton piece in account. So Sabir is not my cup of tea and would not ever visit this place.
Price was cheap. 130 per plate Mutton Biryani. No tax no bill. 
I think that this joint is running only with Brand name which was created a long back.

The chicken in chicken bharta was a tad dry, though. Tandoori chicken was good as usual. Sahi tukra was good as well. One more thing to add, their service was too fast. Within 10 mins, we got everything on the plate.

one of those traditional restaurants of kolkata situated amongst the busy streets of chandni chowk. a place for those people who love to have classic mughlai dishes without going to a fancy overpriced restaurant.mutton rezala mutton chap will never fail to impress you. biriyani with firni as dessert are the most ordered items. service is really good until the waiters will ask for tips. expecting more cleanliness when i visit there next time.

Was there at today afternoon for lunch. Ordered Butter Paneer and Nun. They served it within a reasonable time. The nun, made nicely was too large to eat by a single person ☺. Butter Paneer was also good, both in quality and quantity. Then I ordered a cup of tea. The tea was fully made of milk, no water. I asked them to parcel one plate of Mutton Rezala. I ate the rezala at home, it was made of curd and was a very light yet delicious dish. PRICES ARE ALSO VERY REASONABLE.
Waiters was also very courteous.
Am feeling happy.. 😊😊😊

No comparison of its mutton rezzala  and tandoori rooti with salad and lastly firni. I can't get over the taste of the mutton biryani also. I am coming here in this restaurant for the last 15 years but still can't think beyond Sabir for rezzala. I love this place and those who love Mughlai kind of food , please come to this place because this place will surprise you every time. Must visit place.

Like most other Residents of the city of Joy, Chandni Chowk is a place that people have to go to for something or the other. For my case a visit to Chandni ends with Sabir's. A famous place. Let's start with the biriyani.... It's the kind of moist biriyani I like. The rice is not a fine as other places offer, but the texture is complemented well with the flavour. The meat literally comes off the bone. The whole thing is very good, though a bit greasy. The rezala, as everyone coming to this place knows, is special. It has an excellent aroma about it. Worth a try. They make a few kebabs as well. Although I did not find the reshmi kebab that delectable. It was a bit too dry for my liking. The parathas and the mutton preparations go excellently with each other. All in all, definitely a place worth visiting if you want to gain a few pounds and that too in an enjoyable manner and in a pocket friendly budget.

Located just near the E-Mall in Chadni, Sabir serves excellent North Indian dishes. I have been there on many occasions and every time I had my lunch with immense satisfaction.
Everything is good about this place. Good and quick service. Well arranged seating area and good staffs. And most importantly the price. Yes the price you will pay in Sabir is totally worthy.
The make really good Biryani, worth trying. Beside this Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Chap, Chicken Rezala are few of their best.
And don't miss to try their tea and also Firni both are excellent.
Must visit. Recommend.

Sabir's rezzala- how many times have we heard of it in Tenida's stories? Needless to mention, it is as mythical as it sounds to be. However, Sabir's biriyani is also fantastic, especially the mutton. While I don't like the tradition of inserting a boiled egg in the biriyani, the rice has a nice flavor which compensates for the egg. However, it is slightly oily, but better than aminia! Also, it's very cheap. I have the special mutton biriyani or the rezzala and parota whenever I go.

I recently had the opportunity to visit this much talked about restaurant and I was not disappointed. The mutton resala was a hot piping mixture of aromatic spices in a white gravy. The quantity of gravy was more than enough for me , though there was only a single piece of mutton. The tandoori rotis were freshly made and served hot. I wish to go back their again to try their other dishes

I have grown up hearing tales of this famously old food joint of Kolkata. Few days back I could finally get a chance to visit and treat my taste buds with their famous Sabir special Mutton Rezala and Nan roti.
Mere words cant express the experience. 
A succulent piece of Mutton was served. The nan roti was really soft but it is very heavy. Nothing special about the ambience or service. It is the quality of the food for which people visit the place.

Few years back, I was a regular in this joint, and yesterday I was in the vicinity so I decided to drop by. I was looking forward towards having a good time after awful morning, so I ordered the classics, :-

Mutton biryani

Chicken Bharta

Butter Paneer

Salad

The Mutton biryani was cold and bland and after few spoonfuls of it my tongue fell asleep of so much of hydrogenated oils.

The Chicken Bharta was nothing to boast about.

Butter Paneer, it's four cubes of Paneer served in the Bharta gravy.

And there definition of Salad is two slices of cucumber and a single slice of tomato with some onion rings.
    

                                      PROS

THE CHICKEN AND MUTTON pieces were soft and tender.


                                      CONS

The decor remains the same for last 10 yeara and so as the dress of the server's. The place is rotting away and the management is not bothered to renovate.

The one thing that made a difference was there food but now that has also gone down. 
I feel very heart felt when I say that they don't deserve not even a single star.

I am visiting this place for more than 10 years and I was one of there loyal customers but to see them deteriorating to this level makes me fell very sad.

The restaurant is located close to e-mall in Chadni Chowk area.It's one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata which serve Mughlai food.
They are famous for their Rezala's , specially Mutton Rezala.

We ordered : Tandoori roti, Mutton Rezala and Chicken biriyani.

Their Rezala had very good reputation but what we found on our plate was quite disappointing.
Biriyani was cold and tasted okay-ish.
The place has gone down with almost everything from Taste to Hygiene to Ambiance...

Went to chandni for repairing my phone. As read in zomato reviews earlier I went to check out the special chicken rezala they made which was supposedly famous throughout Kolkata. Well as for my personal review 160 rs was a bit too much for 1 PC chicken. Though the chicken tasted good the gravy was filled with oil and ghee which is not healthy at all. Hope they work on this to make this better!

Its always tough to describe historical value of few places by just getting to know it from others until you actually experience it. This place is one such example. My previous generation praised about this place so many times that I had to visit it at least once in my lifetime. 
And the years old recommended menu... Butter naan, Sabir's special mutton rezala and firni.... This combination nevers fails.. 

I lived the past in the present... . U also don't miss it.

Situated in the heart of chandni chowk market,  Sabir is well known for its kebab and biriyani and not to forget tea. The ground floor reminds you of quite an age but there is an AC version just upstairs. I swear by their kebabs coz they are tasty and cheap. A plate of 6 reshmi,tikka or chicken chilly costs as low as 120-40. They are yummilicious, juicy and tender. They do serve a lot of mughlai dishes and you can choose among them. I've tried their mutton and chicken biriyani with chicken chap, mutton rezala. Whenever I'm around chandni area I try to drop by for a plate of kebab or biriyani.

This is my 2nd visit to Sabir's. Last time we had biriyani,chicken tandoori and firni. And that wad good..but Sabir's is famous for their rezala that I came to knw later. 😁 So on a rainy evening..🌧🌧 we decided to go there. This is situated in chadni market, near E-mall. We ordered mutton special rezala, mutton haleem and tandoori roti. The food was served within 20mintues. The rezala really impressed me,the flavours..the smell,soft mutton pieces with the rich & hot gravy everything made us order one more. 😝 The haleem was also good,tasty,delicious,well cooked and thick..but I loved the mutton rezala most. The price and quantity is also so satisfying according to me. Do visit and taste their rezala..😊

Today all of a sudden me and a collegue of mine decided to go for a meal and selected this place as its very near to our office. 

This restaurant is located in the heart of chadni chowk close to E-mall therefore it can be understood that the area is very crowded. Inside Sabir's the ambience is as u would expect in a british period moghlai restaurant located in central or north Calcutta. Its messy, noisy but tables are clean enough and tidy. 

Sabir's is an age old name for its moghlai dishes particularly biriyani, mutton rezala, phirni.  I had been to this place quite a few times and has tried a couple of variants including special biriyani, rezala, qualia, mutton tikia and phirni. Many people come here for a cup of evening tea as well. Apart from the rezala all the above mentioned items are really appreciable. 

Today it was already 4pm when we entered so we didnt want anything too heavy. We ordered a plate of mutton kasha (2pcs), butter naan, lacha paratha and pepsi. Mutton was soft and juicy,  gravy was spicy and it also had a potato perfectly boiled. Both naan and the paratha were very soft, paratha was slight sweetish which made it perfect with the mutton. It took only Rs 177 to satisy our hunger. The non-ac section rates are reasonable, moreover they donot charge any Vat or service tax for the food, which makes it even cheaper than its contemporaries.  To conclude i will not say its a must go place bt being a foodie u can afford to try it once. If u are planning for a family lunch or dinner the AC section is highly recommended. 👍

As recommended here with hidden gem we went there with lots of expectations but unfortunately experience was not that good.
We took chiken chilli kabab ( very good )
Then we took tandoori ruti and chiken bharta (very bad)
For desert we took shai tudkra ,which was good.

Okay, so I visited this place last week with a few of my friends. It was long since I last visited this restaurant, so my memory of their food was fading. The food was a mixed bag. Their Rezala had very good reputation but what I found on my plate was quite disappointing. Biryanis were okay-ish, nothing worth mentioning.  Reshmi kebab was good. Firni was Good as well but a few of my friends were not happy with it. The order took longer than what you would expect from a standard restaurant. It is a busy restaurant but this is something they should look into asap. Overall I'd give it 3 stars out of 5.

Way back in 1948, Sabir Ali, a luckhnow based cook, came to kolkata to try his luck. He established this resturant which already became a legacy of Kolkata. Sabir Ali can be called as "Rezala Man" of Kolkata, because he introduced Rezala in Kolkata. This is still the place where one can find the best Rezala of Kolkata. According to Anwer Ahmed, grandson of Late Sabir Ali, the ingredients of Mutton Rezala is very simple, it is made by mutton breast, the spices include dahi, ghee, poppy seeds (posto), zafran, and jaitri, but still the taste cannot be replicated in home because of the secrete blande of ingredients and the secret cooking style in charcoal fire. Their paratha is also of unmatched type and go best with Rezala. According to Mr. Ahmed the flour of the paratha is kneaded in milk, malai and sugar which gives it the unconventional sweet taste. The partha-razala combo can make anyone mad, when it goes into mouth, the paratha melts and it gives you the foodgasm. Beside the Mutton Rezala, their Mutton Chanp, Masala naan, Firni and Shahi Tukra are also their iconic preparations, do try them all.

One more thing to mention, the ambiance of the resturant is not cozy at all if compared to the modern resturants of these days. Here you can find the essence of old kolkata. Wooden chair and tables, old type lampshed, attendants here wear old type "Khanshama" dress, no computer printed bill, no option for card payment, only the 1st floor of resturant has got some AC cabins. Everything has a touch of the old days. But it should be remembered that bengalee icons like Uttam Kumar and Satyajit Ray regularly visited this place. This place is a must try for those who loves to taste the legacy of old kolkata.

It is one of the oldest resturant's of Kolkata. Have heard of it but never tried it until the day I was very hungry after travelling through Chadni Market. I was with a friend and we had no idea about the food. We ordered Tandoori Roti and Mutton Kasha. After finishing those it was total pleasure. The food quality was ok types and was enough quantity to make the hunger go. The hotel is a normal one, not something authentic but the waiters are decent and helpful. 
Overall it was a nice experience.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata serving authentic mughlai cuisine . The mutton rezala is it's speciality . My childhood memories are attached with this place in the middle of busy chandni chowk .

This comes with a lot of nostalgia, the Mutton Tikiya out here is just heavenly. The tikiya is one of a kind, it doesn't come soaked in a gravy but it's rather a fried item but adequately moist to go with Tandoori Roti! The rezala here is a speciality, but the tikiya is the most alluring part!

I have only been there once and did not have a very good experience.. I had heard that their mutton rezala was exceptionally good but after having tasted it my views differ. I have had better.. I did not even like the biryani and the chicken bharta was somewhat average.. We didn't even get to sit in the air-conditioned section because it was closed. For me, travelling all the way from ballygunge to chandni chowk and have such food was not worth it....

A classical mughlai restaurant with two sections. Its my first time and i regret it. I mean there were restaurants like nizams that could fulfill my expectation. I prefer not to say anything about the crowd. May be it is for the location. So here my experience why i didnot feel delighted to be in 

- avoid rezala. the taste differs. I had it flooded with oil curry. 
- avoid non ac ground floor. 
- service off guard

and why i appreciated it

- Food came within 5 minutes of placing order

- deserts do full justice to your expectations. may be next time i'll stick to the deserts. the best shahi tukra i ever tasted. 

- cheap. i mean no restaurant provides shahi tukra at rs 40. 

well at this price i didnot expect some heavenly quality or some kickass taste. Stuffs were well behaved and cordial. I regret a lunch like this.

Sabir's is really close to my heart as it is a childhood nostalgia. Every time we went for our puja shopping at esplanade we went there. I am really fond of their mutton rezala and nun, though they are famous for their sumptuous biriyani. This restaurant does not have any branches or may not have the decor as the new one has still one should visit this place to take a leaf of this city's nostalgia.

Tried their chicken rezala and tandoori roti, and the combination just blew my mind away.If any food leaves a sweet sensation after eating it, then Sabir succeeds in cooking up such awesome tandoori dishes.

Most people won't locate this restuarent in the packed Chadni Chowk market area. Though someone who knows this place, they will know it's an heritage restaurant of Kolkata. 
As evident for the name Sabir's is famous for its Mughlai delicacies. 

They don't have a lot to offer n their menu, but the ones they sell are top notch at their price point. Biryani (Chicken my preference) and chicken rezala are a gr8 combination to go for of you are looking for something as authentic to that place. 

You have 3 divisions to this place. One he ground floor it's an open area, generally where family people are advised against taking a seat. So they have a dedicated family restuarent both AC/Non AC upstairs, with cabins for 4 at the NON AC side.

Personal touch - I kind a like this place too as I have been visiting since my childhood with my parents and still seeing the waiters as courteous and product doning their Pathan styled suits still impresses me a lot.

This place represents the classical mughlai restaurant with befitting ambiance and decor.  There food is perfect unadulterated Mughlai. The waiters, chairs tables everything has the classic touch. Some of the wooden chairs in the AC section have been replaced with steel chairs which shouldnt have been done. There is a AC room and a huge hall in the first floor besides the ground floor. the sign board is a painted on on tin sheet. I love the overall package. I went with one friend of mine. I took mutton biryani, mutton tikia and mutton chaap and salad. every item was good. Price is very economical compared to the quality. Next time I will take tandoori, naan, rezala etc.
May such restaurants continue to thrive and maintain the legacy. I love Sabir.

'Sabir', the very name, forces me to indulge in reminiscence...................
This is a very old restuarant of this city, and the history of Chandni Chowk and my family goes long back, since the days of my great-grandfather. We have our family business here. Since childhood I have been to this place countless number of times... Today Sabir may have lost its former luster, but yet I can say people living in Kolkata and even from outside, if ever given a chance, should try their mutton-rezala once, with tandoor roti. My grandfather used to say the quality of the rezala has degraded, but I never believed him. After trying rezala at several places, none matched the quality of Sabir's. The tandoor roti remains so soft even after hours, if you ever bring a parcel home. The roti never crackles. 
     If I spend a winter in Kolkata, I do not forget to have the early morning mutton-paya sold here. Its soupy, hot and healthy. 
     Other items from Sabir's, such as the biriyani, chaanp, etc.  aren't worth mentioning though.

Please don't go by the outer look; the place might look a bit ancient, but trust me, the food and the cordiality of the staff members will simply win over your heart. There are 2 sections: A.C. and non A.C. and in both the sections, the staff were very welcoming and polite. The authentic Mughlai taste of the food is absolutely awesome and the meal was very sumptuous.
We had ordered a full plate of Tandoori, 2 Chicken Biriyani and 1 Mutton Rezala and the bill was quite reasonable as well.
Will be visiting soon! :)

My dad took me there for the sake of nostalgia after we finished some errands nearby.The place is old and rusty but that surprisingly adds to it's vintage charm.Also I was solely there for some fuss-free,cholesterol-laden food.We had parathas and mutton chaap.My dad was a bit apprehensive that I wouldn't like his favourite combo from his student days but the food really hit the mark.It was delicious and since I have a weird penchant for greasy,spicy food,I wasn't complaining at all.I would love to go back and try their signature mutton rezala.

Mutton Rezala is the first thing that comes to my mind whenever I visit this place. You may also try biryani and kebabs but dont miss the Rezala. It's one of the finest in Kolkata.  They have 2 sections( ac/Non ac) so if you are looking for a good and healthy ambience sit upstairs (AC section) if you can.

This was on my wishlist for a long time. They claim to be the inventors of chicken/mutton rezala! Locating the place is easy. Take the next alley after e-mall towards central. Ordered their trademark mutton rezala and tandoori roti. The rezala was different from other places, sweet and the gravy was not that thick and I did not like it personally. The ambiance features an old, heritage feeling. Overall the experience was just OK!

Can give any of the big restaurant a run for their money when it comes to biriyani and kebab,and the rezala from this place is unparalleled. Do try this place out and rezala is a dish you must try. And it also has cabin system still in place,so you can experience a private eating session with friends and loved ones.

Good thing about this place is that this place has not changed in past 20 years. And the bad thing about the place is also that it has not changed in past 20 years. So when it comes to good: it has not started franchisee and retained the same taste and flavor and essence of Mughlai best. Must have here: Mutton Rezala/ Chicken Chanp/ Chicken Bharta/ Soft Tandoori Roti and Biryani ( Mutton Or Chicken). Biryani though here is good, best here is Chanp and Rezala. Menu spread is not extravagant. Simple few items which comes in simplest of cutlery all hot and ready to gorge on. Salad has to be paid extra for. Firni is simple tasty served in earthen bowls. To end with they serve nice and hot tea. yes but hygiene, that takes a back seat here. But considering the food and heritage can risk the same.

undoubtedly food is great with its quality and taste and very pocket friendly. service is also very good and heartily.. only thing that comes to my mind every time I visit here is the decor and all is crying for a renovation.. the cabin culture and all the shapes and size of seating arrangement is OK, and very much able to satisfy nostalgic Kolkatans to get that feel what we always claimed for; but a retouch and good polishing is needed. These days a minimum ambiance that soothes us is a compulsory requirement in a eatery. Only if this has been taken care of, this rating is not too far to get the remaining 0.5 ... :) otherwise I would like to suggest everyone .. "Go For It.. without any hesitations.. if you are now standing beside chandni chawk metro station then you are 2 mins. way far from that place where you can found a great place to gift your taste buds a magical journey".. :)

Been here quite a few times.The place is famous for its Rezalas. I have heard stories of how the legendary actor Dilip Kumar used to steal in for a Rezala whenever he would be in Kolkata. Even today the Rezalas here are your best bet. The other items are also pretty good. Biriyani is pretty tasty.The softness of the Tandoori rotis will floor you...mind blowing stuff. Chicken and Mutton Chaap has its own special flavour. Firni too is pretty good. Prices are very reasonable too. I liked the feel of an old Mughlai hotel in an old rusty corner of Kolkata. The service too is pretty good. The ambience might be an issue with some people, but with friends that's not a big concern.

This place is located inside the Chandni Chowk market and as such the area is crowded. Their main restaurant part is on the second floor. The AC part is clean and clear with small chambers for couples and family. The chambers are very cosy and is a nice place to sit and chat with your partner or have a meal with your family. The food is reasonably priced but they recently started charging VAT seperately. The food tastes well but their biriyani just feels dry.. The chicken and mutton dishes though are a total delight. It might not be the classiest of the places but it offers decent food for the people with less deep pockets and over sensitive taste buds. It is definitely worth a try..

"Sabir's" - the name is enough for the repute of the restaurant. I came to know about this place from my father. Since then, I was in wait of a chance to hop into this place. The restaurant being two-storeyed it has ample amount of place for large gatherings. On the first floor they have place for family dining both in AC and Non-AC, each of which is equipped with a number of private cabins, which is a good place for couples to spend some magical time alongside enjoying delicious lip-smacking dishes. So far I haven't tried any tandoor dishes so I opted to try Chicken Tandoori. Trust me, it tasted like Heaven. The tendered chicken - perfectly cooked from inside - blissfully marinated with all the spices and garnished with generous amount of roughly-chopped coriander leaves, sided along with salads and green chutney - all I can say is too much goodness loaded inside. A memorable moment spent! Do visit and try the magic!

I am a bit surprused that neither have i penned a review or rated this place. This used to be a great place for Rezala- both chicken and mutton. I didtinctly remember the delicate flavour and black peppers and the perfectly cooked meat in a whitish juice, just short of a gravy. Tandoori rotis were great too and the biriyani was one of the best. Went back with friend and very frankly, disappointed. However, the tandoori rotis seemed still quite good. But, it has improved from the terrible state it was around 2006-7. Hope they can get their signature dish, ghe Rezala back in its original grandeur..... Good luck.

I am a bit surprused that neither have i penned a review or rated this place. This used to be a great place for Rezala- both chicken and mutton. I didtinctly remember the delicate flavour and black peppers and the perfectly cooked meat in a whitish juice, just short of a gravy. Tandoori rotis were great too and the biriyani was one of the best. Went back with friend and very frankly, disappointed. However, the tandoori rotis seemed still quite good. But, it has improved from the terrible state it was around 2006-7. Hope they can get their signature dish, ghe Rezala back in its original grandeur..... Good luck.

I accidentally found this place in chandni chowk. I was hungry and craving for biriyani. Entered into this place and ordered for a mutton biryani. Initially I thought the items are overpriced. But after having those, i think this is what i call biriyani. Justice to stomach. Earned another visit.

Sabirs is known for its divine Mutton rezala. It is just legendary and a must have. Goes very well with the hot and soft tandoori rotis. Biriyani is good too but not the best. Kebabs are just fine. Service is fast but i recently found the prices a bit high. Go for the mutton rezala

This place located in the heart of chandni chowk is truly a hidden gem. 
The kebabs & the most talked about, mutton rezala are a must try. 
This is place is quite pocket friendly and serves, high in flavour, delicious food.

Sabir's is another restaurant from the batch of Ancient Treasure. Every hungry treasure hunter heard its name from their grand parents, Oh Yes its that old & that much famous too. Located at Chandni Chock, owned two huge AC & Non AC dining, that can handle a huge hungry crowd easily. Entering in this cave will let you see none of that much decoration but some elegant old feel you will get in that environment, where as AC Cabin is located at the first floor & it also carries the same environment but with some decorations. Its placed in a busy street so overall you will not find pinpoint clearness but somehow environment is comfortable to sit & have your food. Prices of the foods are somewhere affordable or a bit higher.

Coming to the food : Just to ensure, I get the most out of this ancient famous restaurant so I visited this place a couple of time & had tried their Biriyani to Rezala everything. Unfortunately every time I got disappointed. Their Biriyani is absolutely so so type, not much rich, not very spicy, but on the bit higher oily side. Chicken or Mutton inside it presents the same condition, so so taste, not well cooked & spice less. Chaap on the other hand is much spicy, provides no particular taste, chicken or mutton of the chap is not well cooked, little bit on the dried type, even one day I got yesterday's cooked chicken too & that was quite feel able. Somehow their Rezala is quite good, mutton of the Rezala is well cooked, soft, gravy feels nice with their tandoori rotis, taste of the gravy comes through the mutton too. But still this is not the best Rezala at all.

Conclusion : Some restaurant carries only their once upon a time title but not the quality. If you are in Chandni Chock & you are quite convinced to visit Sabir's then go for their Rezala only.

Again one of those eateries which has not been able to maintain its standard over the years. More than Biryani, among the foodies, this place was most famous for it's Mutton Rezala. The quality has taken a big toll over the years. Price has expectedly, gone up. While the ambience is passable, staffs are cordial. I recommend their firni and kebabs. Of not delicious, they are comparatively better. :)

Whenever I used to go to my father's office going to sabir was a mandatory thing that needed to be done. I used to love their rezala though i'm not a big fan of mutton this is d only dish where I could eat mutton. This place still has an old world charm. Be it d spicy chicken chaap or the white chicken bharta I like it all with the hot and soft tandoori roti and salad. Yesterday I went there again with my parents and to my surprise d waiters r still d same so is their ambience and I even like their firni which I dont forget 2 order. Over all nice and cheap hotel which is in fact cleaner than nearby other popular food joints.

If you love food, go and have some here. Period. 

Do not expect extra ordinary customer service  or that sort of thing. This is a place to have just good food. 

Chicken chanp, Mutton rezala, Biriyani and Paratha are the recommendations. Fhirnis for the people having a sweet tooth.

This joint is located a few feet away from Chandni Chowk Aminia outlet , and is found at the end of the lane that goes right from metro gate number 3 . The place is popular and has three types of seating available : on the ground floor , and two segments on the first floor , one of which is air conditioned . The restaurant is airy and is located at the heart of the bustling business district of Kolkata. The kebabs are absolutely awesome , and so is the Tandoori chicken! The chicken biryani is average , and served with aloo but no egg. The chicken reshmi kebab was heavenly ! The staff here are friendly and the food is served really quick, within a few minutes of  ordering. If you're searching for a nice mughlai food joint that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket , Sabir's is the place to be .

Perhaps this place has been around more than I have, yeah I guess it has. Been here innumerable times with parents but only I was little and Zomato wasn't born yet. 
Paid a visit after a long time with a friend who insisted that they have the best chaanp in the city, though I thought they were known for rezalas. Nonetheless I'm not a fan of rezala anyway. So here's how the experience rolled out– 
The place, as in the ambience, seems to have stuck back to the 90's or so- same old furniture, Ac section up on the first floor with private booth like areas with curtain for families and whoever likes to eat in privacy. Good thing, no? No restaurant would keep such private areas these days. 
Coming to the food, we ordered but of course the chicken chaanp, biryani, chicken tikka and firni to finish off the meal. 
All were more or less good. The chaanp was indeed pretty darn nice, yea! One should try it out atleast once and mind you it's not for the 'non-oily' hearted. Cheers!

A must visit for me whenever I'm in Kolkata. Their Rezala is like opium to me. The rest of the dishes are awesome too. Me being more of a mutton person, I can only tell you about the mutton dishes which have one of the most tender pieces ever. So, just order a rezala and dip your khameri roti in it for the ultimate experience.

Sabir's is an old restaurant and is well known among the foodies of the city.
I like the Rumali Roti along with Chicken Bharta as the chicken that they use in that particular dish is not shredded, but chunks. Haleem from Sabir's during the time if Ramzan is also well-known. Typical mughlai restaurant which concentrates on food and only on food!!

We started our Ramadan food walk around 2:30 PM at Sabir's Restaurant, Anukai Chandra Street and the most popular muglai restaurant in Chandni Chawk area. Sitting arrangements were very simple and typical muglai restaurants style ambiance as most people don’t come here to spend lots of time with food or relish ambiance.

Today we started off with Sabir's Special Mutton Rezala and Tandoori rotis followed by their ramzan special Mutton Haleem. The mutton in rezela was super malleable, liquefy in mouth type. The gravy of mutton rezala was also wonderful; seize your taste buds and held them captive for long. Seriously still Subir’s Mutton Rezala could thrill any foodie’s appetite with its tang and taste, really mouth-watering.

Their special haleem was okayish, slightly soupier and nothing much to laud of even after squeezing lemon and adding chopped coriander leaves. I think after trying out their Special Mutton Rezala their special Mutton Haleem felt little bit bland as taste and flavours of rezala was still teasing our taste buds.

On the whole it was a nice start of our Ramadan Food Walk. My honest advice to fellow foodies that they should try haleem first, if they planning to tryout Mutton Rezala also.

Went there to have halim. Ended up having tandoori roti along with chicken bharta and their well renowned mutton rezzala. Looks kind of oily, but the taste is heavenly. The chicken bharta here actually is not shredded as we are used to everywhere, but consisted of 4 chunks of chicken. Didn't make any difference to it being delicious though. Located in Chandni Chowk, 5 mins. from the E-mall, this place still has those old Kolkata booth like tables on its second floor. Was a pleasant experience this. Not like those luxury Arsalan or Shiraz outlets you'd see near Park Street, but definitely some place you'd go to enjoy good north Indian food!

What to say! Sabir's is my childhood memory since we are staying in bowbazar central kolkata this place is like a neighbourhood moghlai food joint for us. Those days in late 80's... Mid 90's are golden days. Chaps.. Rezala.. Biryani all r delicious there. And as we shifted to some south urban area in mid 90 the attachments to aminia,sabir get effected. From 95 to 2015 i can hardly count any visit to sabir's! But childhood memory's are best one so i give it a try in a clear august evening here in 2015!entered solo. Seated in gr floor. Those broken tiles... Those dressed waiters.... The tables... Uff!!! Typical Lucknowi old fashioned mughlai restaurant essence. Loved it once again! As the waiter came to me and asked in hindi 'boliye sir!'without taking any time i told him 'ek rezala aur do tandoori roti'. Food arrived within 3-5mins.as i forgot to mention him whether chicken or mutton rezala he served me mutton. It was juicy.... Amazingly tasty. The mutton was like so soft that you will praise them surely!! Lastly there are many restaurants in kolkata these days. Many of them are high priced  and with good ambiances. But these old kolkata food joints can beat this high fi places any day by food taste!! Regards

Visited Sabir's after real long time. We 3 ordered Tandoori Chicken, Tandoori Rotis, Mutton Rezala, Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chaap & Green Salad. Food was good specially Rezala. What was surprising was the cold & worst behaviour of their service staff. I still remember the way he rejected my request of extra chutney. Also he was banging the plates on our table as he was not happy to serve. FIY, we went on the 1st floor AC restaurant. In the end, I tipped him a tener but he refused!!! With a bitter experience & full tummy we left. Recommendation: YES for Food only

Sabir is very good choice for classic rezalla dishes. The mutton rezalla is perfect with smell and taste where you feel like wiping the dish with your tongue to the last. Also one of the best place for shahi tukda, the sweet dish. Served cold, u need to visit Sabir before 3pm or else the dialogue you have to hear is "aaj ke liye to khatam ho gaya babu"

Located in one corner of the Chandni Chowk market, Sabir's is a sign of heritage in Moghlai food. There famous Mutton Rezala is the best in Kolkata. It goes best with the tandori roti. Mutton qorma is also nice and the biriyani is average. If u r a foodie and love moghlai food u ought to try the rezala and will surely fall in love with it.

Exploring a new eatery down a dark, dirty,dingy chandni chowk lane is quite exciting.

We sat on the ground floor and there was a first floor as well.

The restaurant was dirty,the plates were not clean,the waiters with their white uniforms, along with their pagdis werent washed,but I still rate it 4,simply because of their sabir special mutton rezala.

We ordered chicken biriyani ,sabir special mutton rezala,tandoori roti.
The chicken biriyani was below par.Do not have it.
Now COMING ON TO THE LEGEND-REZALA.IT WAS HEAVENLY ALONG WITH THE SOFT TANDOORI ROTI.It lives on with the legacy .

MUST VISIT FOR THE REZALA.
This one time all the items were my recommendation and not Taniya's.

Taking about the food , its simply amazing . Me and my friends ordered chicken chaap , mutton Rezala and chicken bharta.
Chicken chaap was truly delicious . It was nice and tender. I am not a fan of rezala but wow, i was shaken up with the Rezala , absolute surprise to me. Taking about chicken bharta , well it was average .  I was expecting shreded chicken but it was small sized chicken in a yellow gravy , not impressed.
Staff is courteous and service is quick (I visited around 2 pm)
Its only the decor that brings down the rating else I would rated it 4.

I might not appease Sabir's fans but just couldn't stop being honest . I heard a lot of fanfare of Sabir's rezala , mutton of course! And the halim during Ramzan . While the former was a known taste which perhaps has lost its monopoly but the halim was one for which my tastebuds were hyper emancipated.  The first dollop of the stuff from the old shabby China drilling down my tongue whispered that it was cheated by repute. I can vouch, kolkata has far better options of halim than this antiquated option sprinkled with mint and withered chilli .  I can't thaw on an opinion that one would ever think of decor or presentation or the shade of white on the waiter/bearers uniform when u come for sipping on rezala or stew at sabir. Overall I won't recommend when you have a plethora of Mughlai options in Kolkata , as your food does not come free.

Sabir is the oldest Mughlai restaurant in the Kolkata. It is located at near Chadni Chowk. Last night we went there for Halim and Mutton Chap. When we reached at there, Halim was not available. We took Mutton Chap and Laccha Paratha. These combinations are awesome in taste. After that we took Mutton Biriyani which was not up to the mark. I think maybe the cook are recently changed, because Sabir's Biriyani is a famous in town. There are many other options in dishes, but I always prefer that menu. Here Chicken Tandoori also good. Staff are good and they worked here more than 20 years I think.

This restaurant is difficult to find..but the mutton chanp they serve is worth the effort.The gravy is rich in terms of smell n taste..mutton pieces r tender..n hardly there r bones(mutton chanps in most of the mughlai cuisine restaurants r difficult to eat because they contain hell lot of bones).Chanps from sabir tastes heavenly with rumali roti n tandoori roti.For me sabir serves the best mutton chanp in Kolkata.

I've been coming to Sabir's for a long time now. Located near Chandni Chowk Market, this place serves great Mughlai Cuisine. The place has always been shabby for as long as I can remember. And its dirty. However, the service is really fast. I've always had - Biryani and Chaanp here. Their preparation is a bit different than most of the Mughlai restaurants  in town, and I kind of like this variation. I had never tried their 'much highly talked about' Mutton Rezala, until my last visit. This time I ordered Mutton Rezala and Laccha Paratha. Sadly, it was something very average. Nothing out of the world as described in most of the reviews. The laccha paratha was really good though. For future visits, I'd rather stick to their Biryani.

From when did sabir come to open there store in machuabzar?? 
From the times of my father there is only one sabir hotel and that situated in chadni chawk. Now anyway come to the point. We all know for what sabir is famous for. It's resala and of course mutton. The problem is that it only available in Thursday. Now if you want ambiance and decorations please don't go here but yeah you can try the first floor. There is it's ac room. Now the other part is that sabir is a family restaurant. The reshmi kebab r just lwa jabab guru.. 
And the tea is made of with the milk of lamb. So it is different from others. 
And sabir is always pocket friendly. 
So 4 from me.

Had laccha paratha and mutton rezala and mutton chap ! The taste as everyone is said is just out of this world ! Its a great place to enjoy good north Indian meal ,though they lack in ambience and service but still a good enough place to eat some amazing north Indian delicacies ,and oh do try the firni,that's not bad either !

I think Sabir and Mutton Rezala are almost synonymous for many Kolkata foodies.. This particular delicacy of their has attained a cult status and even though they serve a variety of other delectable Mughlai dishes, if you are at Sabir invariably you will order the very nostalgic Mutton Rezala alongwith other dishes..They have an unique style of preparing this dish..Although I have tasted Rezala at so many other outlets this always taste different..The texture of the Rezala is also unique..a whitish gravy with a tinge of golden texture due to the oil dripping from the meat..a slightly sour taste..taste heavenly with its signature Laccha Paratha,which is also slightly sweeter in taste..
This joint located in Mission Row close to Chandni Metro is basically a no-frill attached place..ambiance is pretty ordinary though they have an a.c. family room upstairs,but it is always about the food..Also love their light,non greasy Biriyani and their delectable Mutton Chap..Sadly like many other outlets this place has also fallen prey to times and the quality has dropped significantly.. the sixe of mutton has been trimmed, the Rezala misses the old magic and the prices have gone up as well..Still recommended for a taste of good old kolkata.
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

It's an old heritage restaurant. Located near Chadni Chowk, Kolkata. The ground floor is non-AC while the first floor is air conditioned with the old cabin system. 

They are famous for their rezala.The Mutton piece was tender and soft but not quiet hygienic. You should have it with tandoori roti.

Worst biriyani i have ever had. Very bad ambiance. Briyani was so dry that after every gulp i had to have a sip of water. Mutton chaanp was more like onion chaanp. I could not find any meat in it. Few bones and onion was what a had. Worst experience.

This place has been visited by me since my childhood days and till today this restaurant in chandni remains my family's favourite. 
The prices of the food are very reasonable without pinching a hole in your pocket. 
However , lately they've been serving undercooked tandoori chicken - the meat was pinkish and soft.. 
I could forgo once... but the same things occurring 7 out of 10 times ??
Overall its good . However they should check the quality of the food.. Don't lose your customers serving undercooked chicken.

It's an old heritage restaurant. Not quiet hygienic. Ambience isn't great either except for the AC section. Food quality is very good. The chap, firni and biriyani here are the must tries. The service is bad. Waiters are unruly. The overall experience is certainly not worth the price.

If you are a tech-savvy person and you frequent Chandni Chowk area in Kolkata to purchase electronic items, it's pretty unlikely that you haven't come across this restaurant. 
That one thing, for which this place is so revered, is their rezala dish. The portion of the meat that comes with the dish is filling and one would be left craving for more. The Biryani served in this restaurant does match up with the quality of the biryanis served in more popular restaurants like Arsalan, Shiraz. The Mutton Boti Kabab is also a must try.
The ground floor is non-AC while the first floor is air conditioned. Furthermore, this restaurant still adheres to the cabin system (in the 1st floor), much like those shown in some retro Bengali movies.

One of the oldest restaurant in Kolkata. It's very economical. But the food here is not at all up to the mark. Though you can't expect awesome food experience from the point if view of price. The ambience is not very good. I've tried all the dishes (which were available) from the menu. From my experience please don't try the biryani, it's very bad. Can try the kebabs, few of them are extremely impressive. Finally if anyone want some economical food experience, then they can try it out.

Sabir is known for it's Paratha, Rezala and Biriyani. The decor and ambience of this place is not good. Infact bad. Value for money (ROI) is not good. Staff are not at all responsive. Cannot even recommend a dish. Apart from that some plate they cook only on one or two days of the week, so doesn't help the cause.

Do try the following if you are here -

1. Paratha
2. Chicken Rezala
3. Biriyani
4. Chicken Chaap

Only good for college goers and if you are around Chandni Chowk, hungry and don't know anywhere else to go.

Biriyani is not that good, but good in quantity.. Rezala obviously too good..But the dish that is legendary is..PRATHA.. U can't have better than this in WHOLE KOLKATA...I BET!!!
The paratha  tastes a little sweeter..& belive me that makes it Heavenly...they have a secret recepie for parathas here..no other joint can copy that...ONE MUST HAVE A TASTE OF IT's HEAVENLY PARATHA...THAT EVEN BLENDS LIKE BUTTER IN UR MOUTH...

Sabir is a place that has been close to my heart since childhood. My family has been eating here regularly since generations. The signature Sabir's rezala, the mutton boti kabab, and ofcourse, the biryani are the too for. Special occasions without food from Sabir's restaurant are incomplete.

The name of Sabir's Hotel is associated with the old fashioned and laid back restaurants of Kolkata,and it is one place I have visited a lot in the recent years.
Never mind about the hygiene factor or the location of this restaurant,simply enjoy the food.

In this restaurant you will find the waiters dressed with turbans on their heads,and the interior of the hotel dates ages back.
If you are a fan of Bengali Cinema you may find the small cabin rooms located in very old restaurants of this city,and Sabir's Hotel is designed exactly in the same way.
The capacity is quite good and owing to the location of this restaurant,it is never ever empty.
The ground floor has got a very good seating capacity and recently they have also placed an air-conditioning system in the floor above.

The great draw over here is the Mutton Rezalla with Tandoori Roti.I mean nobody can beat their quality when it comes to these two dishes.Good quality,good taste and pocket friendly.
The mutton chaap and mutton tikka with some Paratha compliment the taste buds really well.
The Biryani is good,but not the best of the lot.Their firni is worth a try indeed.Never forget to sip some Cola to digest the food.

At one point of time I felt that the menu at Sabir's has shrunk,maybe there is always more room for improvement for this heritage restaurant.
The waiter had informed me that their elder most chef had passed away ages back.He was the grand old man of the Rezalla.Now his assistant makes the Rezalla.Indeed he is as good as his master....

One of the oldest and authentic places for mughal cuisines in kolkata, this place offers one of the best rezalas in the city...bt not only that the Biriyani and Kababs are also worth trying....the Chicken bharta served with a sliced boiled egg is anodr delicacy this the place can brag about....So if u want to have real mughlai food in a 'coffee-house like old calcutta' ambience, Sabir's is a must try..

Came to know about this restaurant through an article in The Telegraph which said that it serves the best Rezala in Kolkata. I along with my friend whenever visit chandini, we stop by Sabir's to have our "pet puja". The mutton rezala is the best I have tasted in any of the restaurant in Kolkata. I love the chicken rezala which is available only on Thursdays over there and God knows what kind of ingredients they put in rezala that it makes the dish so delicious. The seatings on the second floor is intriguing to see. Some tables are arranged inside a small room with curtains where waiters just extend their hand through the curtains to serve. A cozy place for couples!

Hungry after a day long hopping for computer and electronic goods in Chandni Market, here comes in the infamous 'Sabir'. Yes i do agree, the food and hygeine standards have degraded and so is the ambience but this is the place for good and cheap food which might fill your heart's content but wont cost a hole in your pocket.

I started with the chicken tikka kabab,which was spicy and succulent. As i was there after a long time, i had to order the 'Mutton Rezala' they are famous for, alongside the tandoori roti. The Roti was hot and soft and boy the Rezala looked too good, though it dint taste that great as it used to even 10 years back. Yes the Mutton piece was tender and soft and was a complete winner considering the price. Wrapped it up with a firni which was good, though not great.

Food - 4/5
Value for money - 5/5
Ambience -2.5/5
Hygeine -2.5/5

Will be coming back to try their Mutton chap, biryani and their famous tea. Till then its a 3.5 for me

This is the best resturant for Mughlai dishes. For am admi this is the place to go. The food is very tasty. Service is quick and fast. This place is often frequented by the Afghans of the city who quietly go about their meals. The first floor is much quieter which also has an a/c section. Firni is excellent and through the years the taste hasn't changed a bit. Their Kababs are very good so are the Tandori rotis. The biriyani is good but a bit hot.

21/1/2016

Ordered Chicken tangri kebab and tandoori roti. The service was quick the food as expected 
was delicious. The Dhania chutney, part of the serving was excellent. When I asked for a helping on the chutney was informed that the chutney is part of the plate ordered  and no extra can be served! Much to my disappointment I had to be contended with what was served. Finally had their superb Firni. If you ever go there must have Firni.

Set in the heart of central Kolkata... Sabir restaurant is a must stop gap for all visiting chandni chowk. They  specialises in mughlai dishes... And their biriyani is one of a kind... Low oil... But exquisite in taste... The price is moderate... If anyone visits chandni for buying computers, gadgets or just for a walk by... Try it sometime...

Located in the midst of the busy Chadni Market Sabir's has been serving generations.Their mutton rezala and paratha is iconic.It will be hard to find someone even remotely interested in food who has not tasted or at least heard of Sabir's rezala.

The rezala for which this place is most renowned though pretty decent is slightly overrated I feel.The special rezala is unsurprisingly the most pricey item in their menu but honestly I have had better rezalas elsewhere.The paratha is no doubt good but the issue here is that sometimes they are not served hot and that quite understandably spoils the experience.

The kebabs,the biryani and the chap are not as popular here as the rezala but actually they are nice and arguably better than the much hyped rezala.The biryani is nice and flavourful without being overtly oily.One can easily have the biryani on its own.The mutton as with all most other dishes here is soft and impeccably well cooked.The mutton chap here is also pretty good.The tikia they serve up here is a bit different.It is served dry,as it is,without any gravy and it is also a little more spicier than at other places.The firni which is an absolutely essential component of any Mughlai restaurant is decent but again could be a bit better especially in terms of flavour.

Like most other heritage eateries of Kolkata ambiance here is something which is best overlooked.The hygiene and cleanliness is not the best either.The waiters are moody but the service in general is pretty swift.The prices are more or less reasonable.

All in all Sabir's is one of the landmarks of eating out in Kolkata and at present to go with all the heritage and legacy it still serves up quite decent quality food.

All around the comment section I see the people going gaga over the infamous mutton rezala and paratha. I'm not and never was a mutton fan, and meat with bones is an absolute no-no for me. Biriyani would be the second optimal choice, but I being the odd duckling, do not like biriyani either. So I'm going to talk about a couple of items which none of the reviewers most probably cared to taste. My lunch for the day consisted of chicken tikka kebabs and a cup of chai. The tikka kebab was exquisite. Crunchy and spicy in just the right proportion, and the chatni provided with it formed a great combo. Among other items I tasted the paneer butter masala, which was good but not exceptional, and a bite of roasted chicken here and there, which tasted almost same as the chicken tikka except for the abundance of bones in it. Now, the show stealer was almost surely the chai. I have had my experiences with tea, the good ones and the bad ones, and I think this was probably the best one I've ever had in my life. I don't know what they use to make that elixir, but that surely was a little cupful of heaven. A must try in my opinion. About ambiance and such, we chose the non-ac compartment, but it wasn't hot even with the sweltering heat outside. The waiter was very friendly and swift. Pocket pinch 150 per person, which was quite okay.

If you're looking for a restaurant where the ambience doesn't matter and all you want is great food,then let me tell you ,my friend,your search ends here.They serve the most amazing biryani,one of the best in Kolkata.But the thing that they are famous for is their Mutton Rezala...even thinking about it is making me drool.They serve juicy and succulent pieces of mutton in a lip-smacking gravy...I bet you won't find a better rezala in Kolkata.A piece of advice though...do not take your girlfriend to Sabir unless she's a foodie.She'll find it "eww" and "dirty" and I won't be surprised if she ends up breaking up with you.Happy Eating !

Now other reviewers will be killing me right now! Atleast they must be calling it insane but nothing.. absolutely nothing can stop me from telling everyone that sabir's special mutton rezala is the worst one I've ever had in my life. A small bad piece of mutton with bones and almost no meat in a thin watery gravy is what we got as "sabir's special mutton rezala". The 1.5 is for the hot tandoori roti, the rezala has got a 0, a negative would have been more appropriate. Overhyped it is! And don't you dare ask about the decor. The have not changed the chairs,tables and even the curtains since they started the restaurant. Wasted my day :(

Their Sahi Tukra get's sold  than  almost by 5'o clock, by order in restru or takeaway- A bullet has never it's gun faster! It's goes without saying, it's a must have.
One of the great  restaurants of Chadni Chowk, it has an old world charm of Kolkata.

I visit this place whenever I go to Chandni market. Sabir offers Ruhr best mutton rezala in Kolkata. I have had it since five and still love it though the quality has not remained the same over all these years. The biryani is also good bit nothing extraordinary. If you are tempted to have the sheekh kebab, be prepared to use your teeth more often as they are not melt in the mouth. Apart from the rezala, another specialty it's the malai chai made from buffalo milk.

Wanted have a nostalgic experience, and what a let down, well I wasn't there for the ambiance but it would have been nice to have a proper one. When I reached the 1st landing was given a choice of AC and Non AC, chose AC as the it 35 degrees in the shades, it was not even cool. I ordered for the special (mutton rezala) hoping that it will mar the bad experience but it was even worse, mutton was chewy with an awful smell abd the gravy was grainy, not creamy as it should be, want forget the experience.

I love the mutton biryani and it's one of highlights of this place. The mutton chaap  another one such delicacy which cannot be left out. The mutton rezala and laccha paratha or rumali roti is the perfect combo if your up for something light. And always remember to end the meal with a shahi tukra which is a lip-smacking dessert. Fast service and great ambience.

This particular restaurant can be credited for one single dish - Mutton Rezala. They have invented it I guess. And even if they haven't, the dish is defined by them. 

This is beyond any sort of doubt, the best Mutton Rezala in town, if not the country. Located in the alleys of Chandi Chowk, be aware of parking problems. Don't expect any fine decoration inside - you have come for the Rezala, haven't you? So what do you care about the decor? 

The Rezala light, extremely light - you can easily get 2 or 3 of them. Mind you, you should have it with the Tandoori Roti or a Roomali Ruti. Avoid the Biriyani here as it's not a great one here. 

Long live Rezala. Long live Sabir's.

MUTTON REZALA. One dish that defined this restaurant for decades , is worth a try for Mughlai lovers . The MUTTON BIRYANI is properly cooked and the mutton is tender enough. The CHICKEN KASSA tastes fantastic with PARATHA or TANDOORI ROTI. The FIRNI lacks richness but is sweet enough to melt your heart. But don't U dare go there for their ambience , they have none  . Good old fashioned Mughlai restaurant with rich history of tasty food.

The Kolkata food journey isn't complete without a visit to Sabir, considered to be a heaven for North Indian cuisine. Lachha parathas, rezala, chaps, you name it all!

Located at chandni chawk, I have visited this restaurant countless number of times and still do so whenever I go to Chandni chawk market to buy computer accessories or any electronics goods. A restaurant which you wont admire for its ambiance or décor, but when you taste the food you would be blown away. Its a two storied restaurant, the ground floor being non ac where as the first floor is air conditioned. Forget the menu card when you go there, order biriyani, kebab and firni, and thank me later. The biriyani is a different level, and do fall under the elite league of arsalan, shiraz etc.. The kebabs are too delicious and the firni is awesome. It's a legendary restaurant with reasonable rates and is a must visit if you haven't done so (which is unlikely).

my Grand-D took my mum to This restaurant when she was 4... My mum took me here since i was 4... This place holds good memories for my mum... The fact that the food is decadently delicious is the main attraction. On top of all that the service of the staff is just so courteous friendly & pleasant. A foodie can't ask for more. ????????????

This is probably the first restro where I first tasted mutton rezala and tandoori roti about 22 years ago. The flavour and the creamniness of the rezala reminds of the pujo shopping in my childhood days. My father's office was in Chandni Chowk and every time I visited ,I made it sure not to miss the rezala. Years later,it tastes the same.
Although the ambience is not good,but the food tastes like heaven. I did not try any other dishes though! the rezala gravy is light and melts in the mouth. The mutton were very soft and easy to go with the spoon.I give 4.5/5 simply for the rezala.

This plase sucks . Evry thing is avarage . Bad environment non hyginieic . Cat is wondering .  I orderd mutton rezela and tanduri rooti .

Mutton rezella was a beat on sweeter side but i did not find it astonishing . 

 It is a one time going plase .

I have been visiting this place since I was a small child,and my parents used to take me to have their Tandoori roti and Chicken Rezala, Biriyanis and Chicken Chaap. Absolute paradise for people who wants to taste authentic Muslim cuisine.During Ramadan,they serve Halim - mmmm...mouth watering.That's why I beg to differ from reviews provided by some reviewers.Yes,it is true that this place is not one of the cleanliest of Kolkata Restaurants but it does have the old-world charm and tehjeeb shown by the mostly aged waiters attending here (I think it to be + point). Service is really good in here-You order food and food arrives in a jiffy.And their firni,shahi tukra!!!! mashallah....Actually I should have asked my mother to write this review as she always asks for extra Rezala and firnis every time she visits:)

Sabir is what I have grown up listening to. My parents used to sneak peak their time out of their offices to catch up for a quick lunch. Have heard praises bout this restro. The age old restro still stands today serving one of the better mughlai cuisines of kolkata. The conventionally great mutton rezala and lachchha paratha is the deadliest combo. Rather its the best ever preparation in kolkata. They serve great firnis as well. Office times are hectic. So feel urself lucky if you can really grab a seat. Or thr best.. parcel it.

Yes, this one is also standing there since ages. Famous for Mughlai dishes specially mutton rezala. Average food quality. Poor ambience and very poor service. I have been there couple of times and both the times I have found the place very filthy. Water basin overflowing, taps not working properly. Looks like the waiters are all there since the restaurant started. They are in their 50's or 60's. So you can understand what type of service you will get. I had biryani, mutton rezala and mutton pasinda. All were average.

Yesterday visited this place again with a friend. It is a must whenever i go to chadni for computer parts. First of all this restaurant needs to be more tidy and hygienic. One waiter almost dropping the gravy in hurry, luckily it was not our order :D . We ordered chicken rashmi kabab and mutton biriyanis. Kababs were tasty, would be better if it were more soft. Biriyani is as usual very good and up to the mark. Would love to visit again and again.

A Dirty, untidy, clumsy and unhygienic place. I found this place not at all up to the reputation it holds. Taste of our food (chicken biryani and chicken chaap) was ok, not so special but the the place was dirty. I never enjoyed my food there. They need to have a reality check on their standards and offcourse maintain some basic standard on some parameters as an eatery.
Hygiene is a big concern there.
I rate this place below 2.5 on ambience, 3.3 on food, service was as usual super quick, nothing special, waiters were too much casual and arrogant. So, for service 3. "Yahaan aisa hi hota hai" is a very commonly used phrase here.
My chicken chaap was not properly cooked, it was undercooked.

Absolutely wonder place to try mughlai dishes. If you complain about the food then m sure the day was not urs to try.
I can hardly imagine anyone else preparing quality biryani every time. I have tried out Shabir's many times and every time I feel blessed with the food. The aroma of food is excellent, it is not over scented. Chicken bharta with biryanis are excellent combination to go for. Rezala with naans and tandoori will be good to have. They prepare excellent firni. 
Ambience needs improvement as you might feel lack of privacy at times when waiters keep on staring from far. Need improvement in keeping surroundings and interior much cleaner. Prices are reasonable and one cannot complain on that.

My 2nd visit to sabir's and this time i tried the popular sabir's speciala- Mutton Rezala, roti and Shahi Tukra. Mutton rezala was the worst i have ever had in ny life! It was sooooooo thin... Watery... The quantity of water was a lot!! The gravy should be much much thicker. Tasteless.watery.. Less salt.. I am never coming to this overhyped place which is good for nothing except the price..
Thank God that the shahi tukra was good. Shahi tukra u can try here. Bt nothing else is really worth it. Absolutely nothing!!
****************************************************

Unfortunately, did not find this place as good as people claimed it to be. I ordered chicken tandoori,mutton biriyani, chicken chap, and firni. the chicken tandoori was good. and I would like to give my 2 points only for it. The biriyani was absolutely dry. Mutton was not soft. the chicken chap seemed spoilt, and when asked about it, the waiters said, "yaha aisa hi hota hain". Firni was as good as home made sooji, which it is not supposed to be.
Cost for 2 in my case: 500 approx (no alcohol).

Sabir's Restaurant occupies a very prestigious position in the annals of Kolkata's food history. Till yesterday evening I had only heard and read about the legend of Sabir's. For the first time yesterday I experienced it.
The place itself has that typical old world charm. The overhead fans come down to an acceptable height with the help of those elongated rods, the bearers attired in the typical white coat and white bottoms accessorized with the broad cloth belt and the lone man sitting at the cash counter. The place has it all to make you fall in love with it instantly.
I could not wait to try the renowned mutton rezala and the chicken chnaap. There were two of us and we ordered a chicken chnaap each with rotis. The rotis were soft and warm and seemed very fresh and the chnaap was piping hot. The chnaap with the roti was a wonderful combination but the real deal was the rezala. The rezala and roti combination to my mind is a match made in heaven. The crusty portions of the slightly savoury roti dipped in the sweet and creamy rezala gravy will simply sweep you off your feet. I realized yesterday what I had deprived myself of by not visiting Sabir. There is not much to complain about the value for money and the service. I am definitely going back for many more rezalas. Many more.

being a true bong and a hard core non vegetarian, Sabir's is the place to visit and have a bite. I had the mutton rezalla and tandoori roti here and friends went for biryani. I must say that the rezalla was fabulous, a bit spicy but i am an begali, so "who cares!!" being a family restaurant, the ambience was good and u'll definately get value for your money..

Pros: At a point of time, biriyani n Sabir were synonymous. It remains as one of the best biriyani makers of Kolkata maintainin' it's legacy! Located in the busiest area of Chandni Chowk, the resto is always in great demand. AC cabins are available.
Cons: Absence of a revamped new look puts this age-old joint in the backfoot!
Don't leave the place without: Havin' their Mutton Rezala.

experience with sabir is dated back to college days. i can remember going to chandni market to procure electronic items for project work and in the lunch headed straight to sabir. the order was standard every time - tandoori roti, THE famous chicken rezala and firni to sum it up. every time the food experience was awesome. you MUST taste that rezala once in your life to understand it's specialty. during ramzan they used to prepare haleem as well but don't know if they still do it. last visited in 2007, it was as usual a good experience then. i don't know if it's still good in recent times. ambiance is basic, decor is nothing to write special about. menu is limited, don't expect great service everytime. but, that rezala..well..it's heavenly always..

Sabir's speciallity has always been Rezala. But their chicken bharta, tandoori chicken is equally popular. The tea and firni here is equally in demand for the local shop owners around the area of Chandni Chowk. Would like to taste halim during ramzaan time, which I've missed till date. Quantity, quality and service is real good.

We accidentally came across this place a few weeks back and tell you what i have absolutely fallen in love with place.Biryani served here was very light yet the mutton pieces are so well cooked and succulent.Infact this is one of the best biryani i have had lately.Their REZALA is again one of the best.The entire dish is so well cooked starting from the gravy,the mutton and even the dried red chilly which is just perfectly tempered.I suggest having it with roti instead of parantha because the oil in the parantha would absolutely kill the array of flavours.To complete the meal one should definitely try out a plate of MALAI with a sprinkling of sugar.BURP!

Don't go by the ambiance of this place. Go for the food alone. In the hustle bustle of Chandni market, this is the place to have your Mutton/Chicken Rezala. Yes, do go by legacy and word of mouth from old generations and you would find it still is infact the best place for Rezala. Have it with Roomali or Tandoori or Nun cause all are well made and well cooked. Finish your meal with a firni or a shahi tukra and feel the bliss. Price is reasonably low. Wish they had more outlets with similar quality near south kolkata for a bite evry now and then. DO pay a visit.

chicken tandoori
tangri kabab
halem
rezala
mutton chap
lacha paratha
and the firni...

the main speciality is the chatni that they give with tandoori and kabab items..

Too many things suddenly sprung up in my head as I hear this name, again my dad took me first to this place, two sets of dishes available, one at breakfast and the other is duringlunch. 

Only a fraction of the full menu is available at breakfast where most people would be found slurping chay(tea), the food is the freshest now at 11.30 am. Order a mutton stew/kalia with tandoori roti. Its not the western stew but a moghlai stew. You'll get a glimps of heaven if you know what i mean.

During lunch order a biryani with WORLDS BEST mutton/chicken REZALA. The mutton TIKIA is exeptionally uniqui and dry as its a fried version of mutton tikia without any extra ghee. You'll love it.

Extremely economical. Try the firni or shahi tukra(extra sweet though) for desert.

From time to time,it feels nice to get back to the eateries of quaint Kolkata.,to order the same old favourites,to feel the bliss of gharana cuisine.sabir’s  outlet belongs to the Jurassic age, predating its waiters who are content with a Triassic look,or maybe  I got it  reverse.you feel like sitting in a café in Iraq or Afghanistan,with the heavily bearded patrons of this restaurant pouring in in overwhelming numbers,giving you a perspective of the city’s cultural diversity and gamut.i was there at 6,and it was the sheer number of teatotallers  who’d crowded the place.we were actually a bit out of the place,the lone representatives of a younger generation who weren’t here to engage in a lively discourse over a cup of tea.sitting there,we kept observing and reflecting on the minimalist décor for a while,the reassuring part of which was that food was everything  here,that there wasn’t a bulshitting complete package   experience on the cards.the menu card wasn’t extensive,mostly comprising of the widely adulated choices.we ordered naan.chicken biryani,mutton chap,mutton rezala(the waiter claimed this to be the speciality of the place) and shahi tukra.unfortunately,while I must be talking more of the food,there wasn’t any novelty out there.the biryani was a tad less oily,so was the rezala,(which is good)but the chap was ludicrously miniscule,being served on a small saucer .the food tasted regular,and now,on reflection,they didn’t give me any form of dyspepsia. Well what did surprise me and pleasantly so,was the shahi tukra.i’m fond of this dessert and keep ordering it everywhere I find it available,and this was the best by far.plenty of kheer,with the bread being delicately and lavishly soaked in fine dairy,and the hint of nuts made for a killer of preparation.i’d have consorted to ordering a second helping ,but I was too full.the waiter,a congenial veteran,kept getting back to us,and a salad now,and an extra naan later,were all  very promptly received.so overall,not a bad experience

Ambiance: 3.5/5 (upstairs)

Sabir is like an oasis in a dessert. When you are done with your computer assembling come to this place and replenish yourself by having their lip smacking and mouth watering moghlai delicacies. There's never a single day when I went to Chandi Chowk and didn't have their lachha paratha and mutton kasha. Believe me you won't forget the taste and it will make you return very frequently if you are not very concerned with your diet.

Ambiance is pretty shabby but has a typical old Calcutta feel to it. They also have air conditioned and bit better ambiance upstairs if you are picky about the hygiene though.

Food quality and taste is just irresistible. Try chicken/mutton biriyani with mutton kasha or chicken bharta. Tandoori roti and chicken rezala is another good option. Lachha paratha and mutton kasha is my personal favorite. I got my mouth watered just by remembering and writing all the dishes here. SLURP!

Sabir's is FAMOUS for their rezala :D

And its just crazy. Went there with my father and uncle because they have many memories stored in here. Do not think of ambience when you are stepping in here. This is typical old calcutta charm. Restaurant with cabins and basic chairs and tables. Waiters still dressed up with turbans on their heads. That old feel!

The one that is to be tried here is the  tandoori roti or naan and their rezala and you're sorted.
We had mutton rezala. Trust me, its fab!
You might twich your nose because of the hygiene factor, but hygiene factor isnt really a big fuss here and after you have the rezala, I guarantee you are going to forget everything else. I am myself a sucker for ambience and hygiene but I cudnt resist the rezala and the roti both of which were just marvellous.

Happy eating guys
Cheers! :)

Sabir's falls in the list of old restaurants in Kolkata. And surely it maintains its tradition and quality. Biriyani (Chicken + Mutton), Rezala (Chicken + Mutton), Chicken Chap and Tandoor are the best in the menu. Roti items are okay. Price is cheap given the quality of food.
But if u plan to visit with your family, this is not the place for you. While roaming the streets of Chadni Chawk looking for a shop for your computer needs, you might visit this place for a quick treat. 
Waiters are traditionally dressed (not like modern restaurants), surely it feels good. But hygiene is a factor in this place.      
Overall food is great but you might give a second thought before visiting.

If you happen to be in the Chandni Chowk area and long for Mughlai food then look no further.Located amidst the din of electronic shops this restaurant is not at all hard to find.In fact this joint serves as a landmark for several  outlets in the area.This joint opens pretty early in the morning and has several traditional mughlai breakfast items on its menu.But they run out of stock pretty fast.Frequented mainly by the local business community who drop in mainly for some adda along with a cuppa.
Items to watch out for will surely be the tandoori roti, rezala-both variants, mutton korma.I have heard that their biriyani is also very good.Not too oily and heavy on the stomach, though have not yet tasted it.Prices are cheap by mughlai restaurant standards.Guess the location  factors in the price. Ambiance is nothing to write home about, hygiene is an issue and the place is not suitable for family sit-in meals.Take away would be a more suitable option.Do drop in for the love of Mughlai,nothing else matters.

Have not been to this place in a long time !! What I do remember is that it used to be one of the most popular destination for our family outings during my childhood. We used to live in central kolkata back then. I guess I developed a love for Mughlai food from quite an early age and Sabir's was definitely an important factor in that ! I remember loving the combination of the Tandooti Roti with the Chicken  Rezala....I used to literally crave it !! As I grew older, I've moved on.....first to Aminia and then to Arsalan. And I had almost forgotten about this place. Came across it again on Zomato....and from the reviews I guess the Chicken Rezala is just as awesome as it used to be ! I really wanna go and revisit this place.....revisit my childhood. And ofcourse, the Chicken Rezala ! :)

This is a place i have been to end number of times as its very nearby my office,as a lot of people have said earlier there is not much to talk about this place's decor,its very simple,it has got two floors,the ground floor is not very suitable for dine-in but the first floor is sort of ok.They have two different sections in the first floor with AC and Non-AC segments,and they have some private cubicles in both the segments for the ones who wants a little privacy,but these cubicles are quite small for a group of two-three people.As far as the food is concerned their Biriyani and reRezala are good.And what i love is the desserts part,specially the Firnis and Gajar ka Halwa are yummy,but sadly Gajar-ka-halwa is not available most of the time :(. If someone likes mughlai dishes,they can give this place a try.

The Description: In the middle of Chandni Market.. A very old renowned Resto with some tasty dishes.. Mainly a Muslim resto with north Indian and variety of Muslim food flavors. Here you will find the waiters dresses traditionally just like the coffee house.

The Ambience: It has two floored sitting arrangements, Ground for all the flying customers and daily eaters and 1st floor for Family and others. Ground part stays partly full with a long sitting space but seems very unhygienic sometimes and dirty. But the Upper part is nice, few sitting arrangements and clean with Full A.c.  The Staffs are polite and very quick to provide you table and offer you the menu.

The Food: This place offers you pure Muslim food with quality taste. The menu is of course very limited but the items are worth your penny. The biriyani here is really good, not the best but as far as a Muslim Resto is concerned it is very fine. The Mutton is Fab here so the chicken is a satisfactory. Very tasty with less oil and the gravy smells kool. Thou havent tasted many dishes here but overall as fas a i know it has something to fulfill your hungers.

The Conclusion: This place needs to increase the menu item. The quantity of biriyani should be a bit more with the peice of the mutton should be big. At this point i get a bit disappointed.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Probably the best moglai restaurant in Kolkata, overall, in terms of taste of food and service. They serve the best rezala and tandoori roti in the town, no doubt. shahi tukra is something to crave for a person with sweet tooth. very fine biryani, maybe #2 or 3 in taste accross Kolkata just after Shiraz and Arsalan. the best part is their hospitality. Probably the best service (friendliness, helpfulness, courteous, generous) accross all Muslim moglai restaurants in Kolkata. A must try. 5/5 in my scale, only .5 is out for ease of access and locality.

Situated in the not so famous for food area of Chandni Chowk, Sabir's is a must visit for the food lovers of Kolkata. Especially if you still love Mughlai food over pastas and pizzas, this is the place to be. Situated at a 2 minutes walking distance from the Chandi Chowk Metro station, Sabir’s welcomes you to a wide range of Mughlai dishes and the feel of a traditional Mughlai restaurant. Traditionally dressed workers in white turbans and dresses add to heritage feel. You can try your hands on all sorts of Mughlai dishes; biriyani, tandoori, kebabs, chicken and mutton kosha and curries. The specialty of this restaurant, apart from the less oily biriyani, is the Tandoori roti and Rezala. Served in both varieties (chicken on thrusdays and mutton the rest of the week), the Rezala is a dish that will make you come back to this restaurant again and again. Best clubbed with Tandoori Rotis, the Rezala is one of my favorites. However, the biriyani and the tandoori served here do not lag behind in tickling your taste buds. End with their sweet specialty, “firni” and your day as a Kolkatan foodie is highly successful. The pocket pinch is also moderate, so don’t hesitate !

Location : Sabir is probably in chandni chowk and is famous for its mughlai dishes. I was roaming around in electronic shops and suddenly I discovered this place and planned to give a visit.

I had ordered chicken biriyani as of now which was very much sufficient and less oily and food was awesome quantity wise and tasty too.

The cons of this place are:
1) not hygienic
2) not a good ambience.
3) seating capacity is moderate.

Recently tried Reshmi and Tandoori. Succulent and Mouthmelting. Well presented and sizzling hot.  #musttry.

Its right in d middle of Chadni Chouk market.Though crowdy and all,everything noisey,dirty outside whats best is the food and pocket friendly prices.
The place is over crowded during the Ramjan Month bcoz of the superb HALEEM.
Rest of the year my personal favourite is TANDOORI ROTI with CHICKEN RESAALA.
they surely know how to make delicious indian dishes.
All in all its a place to be if you want a taste for good north Calcuttan Indian food.
The restaurant id just 5min walk from chadhi chwok metro.

Sabir's is one of those places which live upto their legends . As for me I heard that Rezala is the must -have- dish here. Yes , the legend is true .The service is fast , waiters are polite and decor is plain .Their biriyani is splendid though you don't hear much of the biriyani made here. The tandoori roti (the laccha paratha too) tastes brilliant with rezala and to top it all their firni is something you must taste.Thus the quality of food being excellent, good quantity and cheap food I would recommend this restaurant.

In Calcutta, certain restaurants are associated with certain dishes. For Sabir, it is their Rezala. Sabir is the sort of old-fashioned restaurant that is serious about the food and service, and little else. There is no decor to speak of - plain painted walls with tiles for the most part, and a marble floor. There are enclosed kiosks kept aside for families that would like to dine in privacy.

The menu is short and lists a number of basic items. The Mutton Rezala is possibly the best item they serve, and is best eaten with Tandoori Rotis to ensure that it does not interfere with the rezala. The kebabs are there primarily for show and should not be tried with high expectations. Surprisingly, their Mutton Biriyani, which is not something they are famous for,  is quite good as well.

It is a good idea to drop in early for lunch so that you can have the Shahi Tukra they make. It is delicious. Their Firni also stands out because they do not make it with kesar or nuts, as is the wont of half the restaurants serving this type of food in the city.

The service is very fast and the waiters polite. The items are quite cheap and the quantity plentiful. Essentially, the kind of place you'd want to go back to again and again for the quality of the food.

Possibly the first Restaurant which I remember having visited when I was a kid, Sabir's occupies a very special part of my mind when it comes to sharing opinions with others about visiting the most-cherished cullinaries of Kolkata. The only reason why this Joint is less known amonst the commoners may be attributed to the location. It stands amidst the most ill-maintained and over-crowded by-lanes of Chadni Chowk, and few would fancy visiting here after jolting and jostling through the over-populated and narrow lanes with make-shift shops encroaching into them. But I can assure you, all this harrowing is worth nothing once you start helping yourself to a plate of their mutton/chicken Biriyani. The overwhelming aroma and its authentic flavour would make sure that it would leave the glutton yearning for more. Accompany the dish of Biriyani with a rezala, or even better,try their special Handi-kabab. The cosy cabins-for-4 are very comfy, and the waiters are couteous. Round it off with a plate of reshmi kebab, and you would not hesitate to burp loudly a few times to express your satisfaction right from the bottom of your tummy. Personally, i would rate Sabir's a few notches above the Arsalans,Aminias,Shirazs', and till date, I havent tasted Biriyani as delicious and worth remembering as that of this place. Cheers..!!

There are a few establishments which defines Calcutta's culinary affair. Hotel Sabir as is the correct name is definitely one of them. Located in one of the by-lanes of Chadni Chowk the place is what I believe to be an everyday eatery. Located right at the end of the lane formerly known as Princep street the place is at the corner of the crossing of two lanes. You should expect the place to be almost always crowded. I feel terrible for having passed  by this joint numerous times but never having entered it. The moment I did step in it became clear as to my former question. This is probably the only eatery I have personally visited which had not one woman customer. I had pre-decided on takeaways since I fortunately have the good luck of residing within 1.8km of this establishment. Having already read about its famous rezalas and with one reviewer suggesting the mutton chaap I simply asked for the lachcha paranthas, rezalas and mutton chaap along with phirni to be packed for takeaway. I had purchased males for 3 people and along with the phirni my bill was a mere Rs400. They have a seating arrangement for people who probbaly wait for their takeaways to be delivered. The server asked me if I would like to wait a few extra minutes for 'straight out of the pan' paranthas to which I happily obliged and while waiting for my food I took a quick look around the place. The marble floor was quite clean and I quite liked the uniform worn by the servers with the turbans and an elastic belt to hold cutlery which was a downer since it seemed not a very hygienic practice.  While the temperature outside had soared to 37 C the interiors were pleasantly cool. There were two large mirrors with ornamental leafy painting adorning its side on one end of the restaurant. A giant clock from Ajanta adorned one of the pillars and a small cabinet with tiny white plates adorned another pillar. I found the old Allwyn refrigerator quite fascinating and someone came and simply put in a huge bunch of coriander leaves and mint leaves. There is an interestingly narrow wooden staircase on one corner of the place right opposite to the cashier's going upstairs which is the dining area for families with an option of getting comfortable inside the air-conditioned room. There was yet another refrigerator with glass door which was stuffed with katoris (bowls) of phirni and soft drinks. I had waited around 15 minutes for my orders but what struck me was there were no other women customers and I believe they aren't usually accustomed to a woman walking in for takeaway which is why every server and regular customer looked at me with amusement but in their looks there was not one bit of disrespect. The food is simply superb. The rezalla which I had thought would be too heavy for the summers was the most pleasant delight I have had in a long time. Made with yogurt it is a cooling dish and the taste is simply marvelous with the right blend of garlic and ginger and onions along with a hint of garam masala (assorted Indian spices roasted and ground) . The dish is soupy with a big piece of melt in the mouth meat. What seems like oil to be floatign on top is actually the fat from the meat. This dish is always accompanied with a whole red chili. The lachcha paranthas which have a hint of sweetness are the perfect accompaniment with this amazing meat preperation. The paranthas are soft, fluffy and best taken when hot. The phirnis are quite nice but does not contain any pistachios and at Rs25 one shouldn't expect it to be laden with dry fruits but is amazingly delicious nonetheless. This place is mostly recommendable for takeaways and my rating is solely based on its quality of food and heritage.  I am simply charmed by this place and cannot wait to come back for its spread of breakfast. I simply feel proud to be part of a historical city. With all its offerings my city can easily be called the culinary capital of India.

The Rezalawallahs! And the sweet Lachcha Parathas!
Ambiance: Well if you're at Sabir's I am sure some good words about the look and feel of the place did not drag you here. Housed within quite an old (looking, at least) building at the heart of the bazaar area is this lovely Mughlai eatery. It has two storeys, the ground floor is non-AC and has a community feel to it (you might even have to share table with some stranger, by the look of it!) but the first floor is where I would suggest you head to. There are two sections in the first floor, the air-conditioned and the non-air conditioned. The best thing about Sabir's is that they have private seating booths in both the sections, which I love!
Service: I've had both good and bad experiences regarding their service. The waiters are efficient and the service is lightning fast, no complaints there. But I've often found them a bit too pushy when it comes to ordering (particularly with the green salad and the desserts, what is the deal?!) and I hate their hankering for tips, which sadly, I had to encounter a few times.
Food: Now the reason I tend to visit Sabir's more than once in a month is, yes, the food! Yes I know they are famous for their Mutton Rezala but I, kind of, am in love with their sweet Lachcha Parathas and the Chicken Chanp! They are my staple there. The kebabs are good as well. They used to make this Chicken Amritsari kebab which they have discontinued for some reason, but I used to love it. The desserts section has limited spread. The Firni or the Shahi Tukda is good. The pricing is very reasonable so more reason to visit this place!
Recommendation: So if you are in Chandni Chowk for your computer/hardware needs, do treat yourself to Sabir's! Besides the Mutton Rezala, do give the Lachcha Paratha and Chicken/Mutton Chanp combo a try!

A visit to Sabir's is worth just for the mutton rezala. Your visit begins, is centred around, and ends there. It is the most wonderful dish that this place has to offer, and it is one of the most mouthwatering delicacies. If you're in the Chandi Chowk area, it is a no-brainer to just gorge on the food.

In terms of decor, staff or service, the place does not rank high. The kebabs are good enough, the bread section is impressive and the biriyani above average. But the rezala.. oh my! It is beautiful, in an artistic sense of the term. In other words, you can just go and have it and come back with a sense of deep satisfaction. And to think that it costs less than Rs. 100!

Verdict: It is very cheap and the rezala is something that I insist you have!

Sabir is the The number one for me for Parathas , Chai and Firni. The food is awesome but yes I do agree that the decor is old but again that's what adds the charm to Sabir in the first place. Good authentic food at best prices.

One of the oldest mughlai joint of kolkata. If you are from Kolkata and not yet had REZALA from SABIR. Just go there.
The best rezala in town along with an equally good firni.

Being in my final year of college this year, this place was on the must visits before I left. And so I did end up there after a long walk from Salt Lake (via a sampling of the Chinese breakfast at Poddar Court, but more about that elsewhere), and I must say the 8 km walk was all worth it. The food here totally lives up to its reputation, and their "Winter Special", Paya is one of the best dishes to savour at 7 am in the morning! Though unfortunately at the time I ended up there, the  'revered rezalla' was not on the table, the Paya, the Queema and the Paratha left my appetite and taste buds merrily sated, and added a bold and significant "check", on my must eats before bidding adieu to Kolkata.

No matter wherever you have had biriyani Sabir`s will always hold a place among the top most of any foodies list.The chicken rezala out there is just special, incomparable with any restaurant. This restaurants is one of the oldest in the city with rich tradition.Nothing special when it comes  to looks(not at all ideal for a classy dinner),but ideal place to go with close friends who just want to have good food.The kebabs are excellent also.I have been a fan of this place ever since my grandfather took me there.

It is old. My grandfather told me its mutton rezalla is the best in the city. And thats how I knew it was old. So old, that it stands concealed amidst the hullabaloo of dilapidated shops of the frivolous lanes of Chandni Chowk; yet it manages to pull people to its tables for its alluringly smelling biriyani, its absolutely smooth and beautiful rezalla and its well-seasoned kebabs. It sets my dear stomach rumbling all the time. I ventured into this old bottle of wine with a friend of mine, who happens to be a third generation fan of this place. His Grandfather and Dad have liked it. And so do I. So, when you enter, dont expect a decked up surrounding. Its all drab and dismal. But you wont really mind all the blandness of ambiance when the food is presented to you. It is cheap, it is a sure game of superfluous tastes and its one thing you shouldnt miss while living in Calcutta.

Sabir's is a name I have grown up with ! Ever since I can remember I have been eating food from there. The unbelievable mutton rezala which is still in terms of flavour if not the mutton quality the best in Kolkata .... the spicy and sinful tikya kabab with the flaky thick Paratha still makes my mouth water. Their biryani is good but not the best there is to be had. I remember going with my Dad on Sunday afternoons and packing up food ... going home and having a delicious lunch ! They make a decent firni too : )

I have been going to sabir's with my dad since I was a child, whenever I came to Chandni Chowk. Sabir is the best Mughlai joint of its kind in that area because of its Rezala, the biriyani, and my personal fav- the Firni. Sabir has the perfect essence of old Kolkata and I love that thing. And yes, Sabir is air-conditioned, for those who missed it, its on the other side of the stairs. The cabins give you a hint at privacy. In short, from the experiences I've had in the past, I won't hesitate to go there again if I'm ever near Chandni Chowk!

Well like everyone i also expected a lot from this place..well it may not have ac or nice interior or well dressed staff..but the biryani was really good..but i must complain about the side dish,which was mutton curry..mutton was not properly boiled,tough to chew and the gravy was full of dalda,so by time the gravy became hardened..
though the rezala changed my mood..the rezala aws just too good..the smell is like heaven,and above all the mutton in this case was lovely..i could not understand why this difference?
their staff may not wear fancy dress or may not speak english,but they were soft spoken..i would like to visit agin..but i think they should concentrate a bit on marketting..

the rezala of sabir always famous, still holds its place high up. but other than that nothing very good to mention about the place. the stuffs are not well behaved much and the decor and the entire place is very much not up to date anymore. the decor is not also very charming.
but if you want good rezala it's still the place and don't you miss it.

Go for Rezala. Best in Kolkata. Both Chicken and mutton rezala are good. 
You get chicken only on Thursdays.

This restaurant obviously does not fit into the new kolkata of ac malls ,kfc and McD s..belongs to a bygone era.The ambience is not great,but the service is prompt.The most important factor however,the food i.e. remains delicious..especially the rezala with naan/tandoor and biriyanis.Even if you dont try anything else,just go for the rezala.

I really love the mutton rezala of this place. If I think of having rezala, this place comes first in my mind. Of course the decor is not good, the adjoining streets are crowded - but who cares, if I get the tastiest rezala accompanied with tandoori roti... 

And what else - the service is exceptionally prompt - except for some dishes like murg masallam.... 

And price is exceptionally within budget. Have the haleem in the ramzan month - which is also wonderful.
