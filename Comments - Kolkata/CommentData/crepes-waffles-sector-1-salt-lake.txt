This Kiosk is inside City Centre, Salt Lake and makes some pretty decent waffles.
I tried their black and white and Nutella waffle and enjoyed both of them.
This place is very affordable but the taste could have been a bit better.

I was too hungry as I didn't have lunch so there are no photos. I had the chocoholic waffle. The outer layer of the chocolate flavoured waffle was slightly crunchy but itself was not sweet. The sweetness came from the hot chocolate sauce and chocolate chips. The powder sugar was minimal. Overall it is good but the price will be high for students.

Located at City center mall, Opposite wow momo. Nowadays a trend in Kolkata of Waffles and Ice-Cream parlour. Had tried it Pizza waffleüçï and Oreo waffle. Oreo waffle was too good in taste. They haven't yet started in crepes and sweet savoury is available in crepes. They have shakes too. Service was Okay. Was crowded. Small kiosk. Will visit soon for more of their items in crepe.

Their waffles and toppings taste really good. They have a nice variety. But they give single pieces of waffles only. Except for the wafflewich. 

What I ordered :

Berry berry waffle - they give you the option of choosing strawberry or blueberry compote on top of cream cheese.

Icecream wafflewich - between two waffles they have vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. 

Nutella waffle - on top of the waffle they give a generous amount of nutella. 

I just wish they gave more for the price.
