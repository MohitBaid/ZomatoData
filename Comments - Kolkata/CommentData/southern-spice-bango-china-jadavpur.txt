I had ordered Chinese veg combo from this restaurant. It had good packaging, easy to unwrap unless others with tightly packed and to tear up the sealed plastic. 

The softness and expertise came along in the food, lil spiced up paneer chilli, nicely cooked rice with limited veggies (adding some more authentic Chinese veggies will appeal more). Pakoras are also good though I had to oven it to make it eatable. 

Overall it’s a good experience.
