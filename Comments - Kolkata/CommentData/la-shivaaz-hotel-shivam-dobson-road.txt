I have been to this place which is quite close to my place!!! 

The ambience is groovy with dim light and good interiors. 

Add on factor about this place is it's staff very cooperative if they get you or else you keep trying to make them understand!!! 

This place offers drinks, hookah and not to forget it's a multicuisine lounge restaurant.... 

The price on the the menu is very pocket friendly... 

They have a very loud music/ live sports channel running on a big screen !!!

It's a good place to hangout at Howrah, if don't like to travel far!!! 

Will surely visit again.....

Very poor ambience with a poor service. The price is high as compared to the food and service provided. Should only be visited with friends if necessary, avoid if possible.
