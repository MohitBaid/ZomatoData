I went there today alone...you can't find too much crowd always bt it's ok..i tries virgin mojito mocktail and chicken hakka noodles. It was good in quantity taste is good. Management is good they make everything ready nd they are polite.Cheap price rate if you are hungry and want food u can try this place
 It's a casual type of resturant.

I always used to visit this place to grab a quick drink and especially to satiate my crave for chicken 65, which was absolutely delectable (exactly how it should be, purely dry small pieces of stir deep fried chicken garnished with curry leaves and coriander), but my last visit left me dissapointed since they had changed their cheff and the chicken 65 which they served was absolutely lousy ( big pieces with sauces and unnecessary spices, seemed like some half gravy item). Since then, I stopped visiting there. Staffs of the restaurant are very cordial and well-mannered though and prices are pretty pocket friendly.

An unsolicited advice...kindly ask your cheff to google the image of chicken 65, he will know what the texture is like and how the taste should be like.

We went there before this puja. Very dark ambience. Pretty average. Not that quick service. We ordered for biriyani at 8 pm. But they told us to sit there for another 30mnts for biriyani. Average food quality as far as the price is concerned. Liquor price is almost reasonable.. Price is very high but foods are not that tasty enough.

I was always reluctant to visit this place but did finally after a friend's recommendation. Visited the place on a Friday  evening and was shocked to see that it was almost full. The place is decent and the crowd is majorly of office people. They also have amazing offers on alcohol. We ordered a lot of starters and  liked all of them. The food is pretty decent and the staff are courteous.

We visited this restaurant during Durga puja. With all the crowd and not having a lot of affordable options, we gave this place a try. We waited for 20 mins and got ourselves a table. The ambience was pretty dark and not a lot of decor. Well, sometimes it's better to keep it simple. We ordered ourselves a few beers and then some masala kulcha and a kadhai mutton and chicken kolapuri. The food was very delicious and the kulcha was indeed very soft. We were a bit disappointed because there wasn't any music playing in the background while we were enjoying our meal. Still, I'd say the service was excellent and this place definitely saved our day when we thought we were gonna return back with an empty tummy. Give this place a shot if you're looking for a bar cum restaurant for your dinner and booze needs. Take care!

one weekend, one of my friend took me saying this is one of his favorite place. next to city center one, this place is small but decorated. the service guys are responsive. i will not say that this is best, but quite good.. i have tried their dragon chicken, fish fingers, golden fried prawn, green pees chat, upon my friends recommendation. the first one was good, but the later ones were ok. they have good offers in the bar menu. (like take 3 and 4th one is complementary!!).. overall, to spent a couple of hours in the weekend would not be a bad experience, but only if you are lucky enough in the rush.

It's a pocket friendly place. I love this place so much that I have already visited it a innumerable times. 
The waiters are really helpful and well behaved. 

A must try thing here is pepper chicken, you gotta try it with beer. It's too good.


Then tandoori chicken... Love ❤️

They have some offers going around all the year ( not in the pujas) like buy two drinks get one free and stuff like that.
Give a try. It's really cool.

A shabby looking mediocre restaurant placed at one of the best areas, just beside city center 1. Alcohol is cheap to some extent because they have some promo offers going on. Their food is pretty good, we tried chilli chicken and boiled vegetables for starters which turned out pretty tasty. For mains we tried Chicken tikka butter masala, which was so so, too tangy and the quantity was very less, then we tried mixed fried rice with hunan chicken, mixed fried rice was good enough but hunan chicken was too sweet and we didn't expect it to be. So there we were dissatisfied. All in all it's a nice place to have a couple of drinks with starters but definitely try avoiding the main course.

Hi...
With a heavy heart i am saying the the service of Farina was the most disgusting than anybkfvthr pubs i been to till this day...
It goes something like this...
I with 7 of my friends went to Farina for a drink and for dinner on Nabami night ( The ones who are not aware of what Nabami is the day before the end of Navratri).
You can see that we came in a pretty big group and I know it was the festive time so as usual Farina was packed and we had to wait in the que for over an hour to get a sit. Smaller groups of 2-5 people had no problem entering they just went in and out like any normal days.
We ordered beer and along with that we had ordered 4 plates of starters 2 in chicken and 2 in fish...
So far so good...
One of the fish dishes that we have ordered provided us with stale food.
We have complained about it. And without judging the appropriate dish we went forward to give further orders for dinner as we did not want to look for food at 1am in the morning.

The "so called" manager did not even come on terms that they have served downgraded food. We literally had to go through a verbal fight to make him understand the situation and ultimately made him cancel the order.
But wait this ain't over yet, the manager said that it is time for us to leave they would send us the bill cancelling the previous order and will not like to cater us any more as we may find faults in the hotel.
So all in all we have to look for another hotel to suffice our appetite at 1.30am in the morning in a festive time in one of the posh areas of Kolkata.

Now step into my shoes and give ratings to this bar and choose wisely.

Worst service. Worst food. Worst stock of beer in kolkata. I won't prefer anyone to go there. The waiters won't serve you unless you ask them to. They surely need a new manager to run this place. Moreover, you have to ask them to take your order not once, but multiple times. I guess they want you to beg you to take your order. So if you don't get to have beer near city centre one, consider giving up than going for  Farina.

One of the worst bar I have ever seen. Behaviour of the staffs are tremendously bad.
Today I was there. They had some problems with sitting arrangements. They said us to change our table 3 times, as we were two people. But still there were 2-3 empty tables. We asked them to allow us to sit there, they denied rudely. When we wanted to leave they allowed us to sit there.
After that instead of sorry one waiter came and asked us in low voice why we said so.
They give you the feeling  that by serving you they are doing some favor on you. Now I am regretting for being there. 
It is my first super negative review on zomato.
If you wanna spoil your time then you can go here.

I was near CC1 last day, hanging out with my friends, then we found this place in the zomato app and it seemed convincing. So we went in and there we were, startled. The tables were stacked together, it was an almost claustrophobic experience. We asked them to allow us to sit in the first floor, which is a bit more spread out and they denied crudely. So, we decided to walk out instantly.

I had been a regular to this place but faced mental and financial harassment here today.  Me and my sister had gone to eat there and the waiter Tapan Pal had have attitude problem from the very beginning with seating arrangements and order.  When asked for the food after more than 25minutes of waiting he told us that if we had wanted the food earlier we should have told him.  On asking the manager Mr. Samir to cancel the order he insisted that even if we don't have food we have to pay for it. And then some guy named Pijush Pal came and cowered us being woman and forced us to pay the bill threatening that or else they will call the police. We had no other way but to pay for it.  This amounts to total harassment.  I hope via zomato this reaches enough people and one should know that farina is a place where you are shown attitude and extorted money on the pretext of service

This is a very reasonably priced restaurant located right next to City Center in Salt Lake. The food is okay- not amazing but not terrible either. We tried the fish fingers and chicken reshmi kabab as starters. The fish finger was good, though a little spicy. The reshmi kabab had a thin layer of fried egg covering the chicken. That looked and tasted a little weird with the kababs, but the chicken was good. The fried rice and manchurian chicken that we had in the main course was quite tasty. 
Their service is extremely prompt- and I went there in the middle of the Durga Pujas, so the speed of service was quite impressive. The ambiance is good, and as I have mentioned before the prices are extremely pocket friendly.

I used to visit this place regularly because of the reasonable rates of their food and drinks. However in my last visit I got really very disappointed when I found hair in their food (special chicken biryani) and a partially eaten potato (the bite was clearly visible). It was disgusting to find these things and I decided never to visit this place again even if I have to pay double the amount of money in other restaurants within City Center.

Intro:
This is a bar cum restaurant located just on the back side of City Center 1, opposite to Gorkha Bhavan. This is a two storeyed building with adequate seating capacity. Four of us went there on a friday night to drink.

Food and drinks:
In drinks they had an offer( With every 3 large pegs they will give another large for free) for almost all the premium whiskeys like blenders pride,antiquity,peter scot. So two of us ordered 3pegs of peter scot and they gave another peg for free. Rest of my two friends ordered 2 750ml beers.
In food, we ordered Chicken Lasuni Tikka, Golden fried prawn and Pepper Chicken.
Out of these three Pepper chicken was the best. Chicken Lasuni Tikka was also good but the Golden fried prawn had some weird smell.

All of these cost us around 2300 Rs.

Service and hospitality: 
This is the section where they really need to improve. They were responding very slowly and were not pro-active enough.

Overall: 
A nice place to drink with your friends with an average food and service.

Huge place. Perfect hangout.  They have offers on liquors most of the time. A bit on the pricey side. Not justified. One can visit with family and friends though.

Located beside city center1 , saltlake. It a nice and decent place to grab some good quality food with drinks at a reasonable price. The decor is simplistic and seating arrangements are quite comfortable.

The chicken hot and sour soup was delicious and it was sufficient for 2. Amongst the starters, the drums of heaven ( chicken lollipop ) really gave a feeling of heaven. The main course , chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken was also tasty. The chicken was tender and juicy and the rice was cooked to perfection.

The staffs were courteous and the service was prompt.

Location wise a nice place near cc saltlake. Ambience is good. Staff courtesy is commendable. The 3:1 offer is nice touch to increase liquor sale. Now about the food. We tried cheese cherry pineapple and fish finger which was so so compared to the price they charge..though liqour is reasonable food is really expensive. Overall a nice place to have drinks near cc bt not a great place for foodies.

Though liked the drinks prices and stands to be quite reasonable, but the food really disappointed me. The rates are a bit on the higher end considering the quality they serve. When you pay 300 for a plate of chili chicken you expect tender chickens,but they were just lumps of breast pieces,the drums of heaven was also disappointing,so was the quality of the noodles. The service staffs was courteous,the seating was spacious and liked the all wooden interior. Management must look into the fooding part. Though myself being a chef,may be I am a bit to finicky about taste and food,but still your menu and  chef needs a Polish.

This is a decent restaurant with well behaved staff and good quality food. The simplistic interior decor gives a very comfort feeling. The Pepper fish, drums of heaven are finger licking good. The chilli chicken dry was a lil too hot for me. Their main course is good too specifically the mutton kasha. Good place to enjoy a pint of beer, have delicious chicken  and have a quality time with your friends.

Very finely decorated restaurant had no table for three available on the ground floor. So we decided to take a table in the first floor. It felt like three girls had suddenly stepped into the 19th century straight from the 21st century!!
All the stares we gathered in abundance from the drinking men around can last for our lifetime and beyond i guess!!
Food was nothing out of the way in taste! No music.
In short, disappointed.

I had visited here 2 times. Second time I came here to make sure that I am giving a right review for this restaurant. Nothing is special to mention here. Food quality , ambiance, service everything is below average but the price is very much high with respect to the services they provided. That's why this place is mostly empty in spite of a superb location beside city center1.

Two things that work in the favour is location and price. Its in a very good location and very reasonably priced. You can not complain about food. But again it is not a place to have a good dinner, mosty people come to have few drinks. Ambience is just like any typical bar. Service is good.

Well I didn't quite like the place. Though the price is affordable and food is kinda okay. But I didn't liked the environment much. But if you are looking for a regular place to hangout on every weekends then I believe this is really fine.

Side dish along with the drinks were somewhat decent but the price was on the higher side. 
All in all if you are looking for a good decent bar with less crowd Farina is for you...
Cheers!

In spite of having such a wonderful location this place remains super empty. Waiters are slow, service is bad, the decorations are not up to the mark, food quality is bad, quantity is worse, desserts are of horrible taste. The price we pay here are much much more of what we get. If you chose this place your definitely leading towards disappointment and nothing else.

Located besides City Centre 1, this is a nice bar come restaurant. The ambience is good (I know its a new restaurant, it would be good if they can maintain the same standards. because I have seen Silver Sands deteriorating with time). Price for drinks is cheap (they provide a lot of offers. yesterday we had four 60ml of Vat69 just for Rs 660 including taxes). And if you buy drinks with offers, you get additional 15% off on all the foods. The food was decent.

You can consider this as the most reasonable bar cum restaurant you can imagine in the City Centre 1 area if you are going with friends or colleagues to hang out and looking for a decent Bar.
            

If you order hard drinks with starters, definitely try their boiled chicken with vegetables.

It's a decent restaurant and the food is really tasty. They serve great north Indian dishes with the right flavours. Kadak roti and any chicken gravy will make the foodie in you happy. Chicken tandoori should be on your list here. Their fish dishes are okay, chicken is better. I've been here thrice and it's worth paying a visit within our normal budget.

Services have improved since the last time and hence I've improved the rating and writing a brand new review. The quality of food has improved drastically courtesy of the newly hired chef. If you're looking to eat something vegetarian with the drinks, go for boiled vegetables or green peas chat. Great service!

NOTE: Beware of the bald waiter with only side hairs. He's really unprofessional and biased. Don't order from him. No matter how hard he tries to sell.

Farina excells in food, ambience and service. It's situated near our office so we are frequent guests and all we can say is that this deserves 5 stars. Being vegetarian I had tasted a variety of dal cuisines which are better than any restaurants and special mention goes to their shahi paneer and achari paneer. Also the staff is very polite. Visiting with family and friends is equally delightful.

This week I took a challenge on myself to try out the uninitiated.The idea behind this is to check out two things, the general trend of cuisines in the new breed of restaurants that crop up in.

For mains we order Grilled Fish and the Seafood Pasta in Pesto Sauce. The fish comes in two thick fillets of Beckti grilled to perfection served with a generous helping of lemon butter sauce.

Good ambience , amazing food, excellent service...VALUE FOR MONEY 10 ON 10!!!

It was a nice Experience ! which to cherish for a long time.

Hello Foodians,

We had a nice evening at FARINA , Salt Lake!

There I found nice ambiance, chilled AC and nice trained polite Service staffs.

However, as there, most of the Tables booked, it took some time for the food to arrive.
We patiently waited for the food and when it came, its aroma filled in the air.The food was nice and delicious and the presentation with garnishing of the dishes were too good.

What pleasantly surprised me was the classic CONTINENTAL selection, the fare quite eclectic, with a sprinkling of international choice and taste. Naturally, my choice of the day was Continental.

Mr. Banerjee
Kasba

Friend it was a horrible evening at farina, saltlake....bad kababs with lot of salt..sweet lime soda was salty...biriyani was made bitter with mitha attar....the waiter who was on the table didnt know how to serve...he just broken the kababs into pieces while serving...We left our biriyani untouched because it had hair in it.
Lousy joint. They are cheaters. Please don't encourage them by visiting. If people really want their time to be spoilt; go and enjoy.
