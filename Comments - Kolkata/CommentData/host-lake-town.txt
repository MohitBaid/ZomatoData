I went to this place quite a number of times. Earlier, it wasn't that bad place. But in the recent times it has turned out to be terrible. In the last two times i went there, neither the food was upto the cost nor was the service nor was the hygiene. The plates kept on the table was full of dust n the table was not even decorated in a proper manner. Nor were we given the plates and spoons and fork on time. We had to manage our own plates. The service was terrible. The last time we went was on 1st january 2018. We ordered for one plate of Drums of Heaven, one Veg Hakka Noodles and one Chicken Oyester Sauce. The very first order, Drums of Heaven, which is supposed to be sauted with sauce and vegetables, were served but were nothing other than dry n just normally oil fried "chicken pakoda" what we call and served just six pieces. We complained about it but the person who served it literally screamed and tried to prove that drums of heaven are supposed to be this way and Host always cooks Drums Of Heaven just like normally oil fried chicken pakodas, although i had drums of heaven from host itself and they served the sauted chicken, the way it is supposed to be. Very very disappointing!! Then came Veg Hakka Noodles and Chicken Oyester Sauce. The quality of the veg hakka noodle was very very very average and the chicken pieces in the Chicken Oyester Sauce were very small in size and served just eight pieces. We were not even given the toothpicks and the mouth freshners while paying the bill. If one wants to get then they have to go to the billing counter probably. Quality and quantity of the food and the service of the people working were very very disappointing!! Drums of Heaven, which was basically chicken pakoda there, for 250 bucks, Veg Hakka noodles for 165 bucks and Chicken Oyester Sauce for 250 bucks and above them was the 5% GST,  wasn't worth it. I would not recommend anyone to go there and would have rated "0" if there would have been an option. Thank you.

The New Year Dinner !
Our host for tonight was Host- A small eatery located near Lake Town , not much spacious yet well decorated.
 We were almost full as before visiting this place we had too much of snacks and all thus we decided we will just have the main course and desserts. We ordered singapore mixed noodles which had eggs , ample amount of shrimps but no chicken and fish in oyster sauce which was mind blowing . To get this two dishes prepared  they took more than 20 minutes. The noodles was very ordinary but yes the oyster sauce was amazing.

Located in Lake Town the place has a good ambience. But the food wasn't that great. The items are overpriced considering both Quality and Quantity.

This place is just 10mins walking distance from where I live. Usually after a tiring day when we dont feel like going anywhere far from home me amd my family visit this place. Nothing special about this place and no special mentions about the food but the price is overrated compared to the amount and quality of food they give! A nearby outlet with great potential may one day become a great place is all I can hope for

Situated just beside the connector road from Lake Town(VIP) to Lake Town(Jessore Road).

AMBIENCE: A small but proper maintained and furnished area with dim lighting. Decorated with Chinese decor adding the essence of China.

SERVICE: Service is satisfactory as they delayed our order. But the co-operation of the staff were good. Major thing is cleanliness is very well maintained.

FOOD: Price of the food is very much high than the quantity of food is served. We ordered Chicken fried rice and drums of heaven(Chicken lollipop). Both tasted perfection but the amount is too less. Overall the food is delicious but very much less in amount.

Overall experience at Host was good.

One of the oldest and reliable restaurants in Lake Town, as far as food taste is concerned. No fancy  decor  and the food is nothing extraordinary - regular Chinese dishes, which you can find anywhere else and at cheaper rate.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Laketown. At one point of time, it used to be quite swanky. However, now it looks just average. The food is really good, and the portions are quite satisfying. The taste is nothing extraordinary, but for the price it is as good as it gets. The only problem they have is that they don't accept cards. At least they didn't the last time I ate. May be they do now, I really can't tell.

This is one of the oldest chinese restaurants located at lake town and yesterday i finally gave it a try for an evening snack..the ambience and decor has a flair of the chinese with dim lantern like lights and red interiors with chinese scribblings on the walls..the seating area is not vast but is sufficient for catering the average no. of heads visiting them at a time daily...we went for the chicken takrai with thai herbs...8 pieces were served (1 plate) and it cost Rs 331 including taxes...so prices are definitely on the higher side..however the takrai tasted really delicious till the last bite..was very satisfied with the dish and the service as well...they serve complementary mustard fried peas and some other salad munchies which were pretty unique and tasted really good as well..would definitely recommend this one to the chinese lovers but ya do have a budget of atleast 1000 for 2 to have a stomach satiating meal...

Since Lake-town still do not really have any great Chinese restaurant as per my taste buds, I wanted to try Host for a change which has been there for many many years. But my experience was quite disappointing to be honest. The place has a moderately sufficient seating area with red velvet chairs and dim yellow lights all over the place. Though I will admit the staff was courteous enough and they were really quick with the order but the food wasn't up to the mark from any aspect. We started with the Chicken Takrai with thai herbs suggested by them which was the only dish that tasted good in the entire course, with right amont of spices and herbs. The Chicken hakka noodles was bad, the noodles were thick and undercooked hence lacked taste. The schezwan chicken didn't really come with schezwan sauce and was a mere generalised chicken gravy and I could even taste the flour with the chicken pieces. Wanted to end the meal with some darshan and icecream but they didn't have anything in dessert apart from vanilla ice cream. Three below average dishes and a they made a bill of 934 bucks. Not at all worth it. Please safely ignore this one. I promise you are not missing ANYTHING.

Just had a dine out here. It's a decent joint. They have revamped the menu which was due for too long. The ambience and staff has been changed. Bold decision by the owners. The lighting used to be dingy but new decor is soothing. The introduction of Thai into the mix will surely keep regulars like me more interested.
Food quality has improved due to introduction of the new chef. Gone are the araroted chopshei.
 Thanks and Kudos! Surely more visits are awaited.

Nice place to dine out at Lake town area. They serve good Chinese food but must try is Green Thai curry which they serve with lemon scented steam rice. I am in love with chicken takrai and butter garlic fish.
I will be there next time for sure coz of luvly food and it saves my pocket much according to their quality. 
Good work guys.

Lol....it's my opinion either I go for one plate or more... lastly food came...it's gravy noddles.... blackish in look...with Stinky flavour...I ask for mixed one...but I hardly found a piece of chicken or fish in it...we leave the place with big zero...thumbs down for host.

Host is standing in Lake Town since last 30 years serving Chinese Cuisine. Their quality and service has been maintained at a very good level in its long journey. This place is sure to make your dining experience a memorable one. The place is located about a minute walk from Lake Town Clock Tower. Easy to locate, opposite of Wow! Momo counter on the road. The ambiance is good, Chinese portraits and wall decorations all around. Dimly lit up with incandescent lights.

A place serving food for 30 odd years tells you the story of its quality of dishes and the consistency they have maintained over years. Host is one of those places which wins your heart with its utterly good food. Located in Lake Town just opposite to Maruti Suzuki Showroom this place is easy to locate.

Talk about serving people with their food and service for over a decade. There are few who are there. And if i say any place is serving for over 3 decades then don’t get too surprised with that because HOST are hosting people for food for this number of time. Its really a long time for any place to stand out that good and be a winner among the people. Consistently and very consistent in making Chinese food is a tough job to do but this seemed quite easy job for them over the years.

Host hosted well...

Just kidding... it's one of the oldest place in the area... yes 32 years not a matter of joke... so we decided to give it a try... the ambiance was cool... deco is good... nothing extraordinary... but quite impressive... Coming straight to the food...

# Fresh lime soda (sweet & salt): Very good...

# Som Tom salad: Very tasty...

# Crispy fried broccoli: Awesome... highly recommended to all...

#Fried fish with garlic and scallions: Quite good too...

# Chicken takrai with thai herbs: It was also good... but i think the sour quotient was bit low in it...

# Rosted slice lamb with thai chilli: Very very tasty...

# Thai green curry prawn with lemon scented stream rice: Perhaps one of the best dish I ever tried... Insane man... Just give it a try over here...

# Stir fried assorted vegetables with soya garlic sauce: Very very good one...

# Stir fried chicken with mushroom and ginger: Good one too...

# Wok fried noodles chicken: Another awesome dish... it was so yummy by itself... also gone well with the chicken with mushroom...

# Darshan with vanilla ice cream: Excellent...

the service was good... staffs are very well behaved... pocket pinch was quite acceptable...

The restaurant epitomizes tradition. It's been standing tall since times immemorial. 32 years to be precise. We used to frequent this outlet until we started getting more options down Salt Lake. On a quick visit, found out that they have revamped the place. Host serves Oriental and Thai cuisines. Amidst an array of dishes, what stood out was the:
Crispy Fried Broccoli with Chilli Plum Sauce : Sweet, spicy, crunchy dish that too innovated with broccoli s, tastes and looks like chicken. The sauce had the right amount of stickiness.

Fried Fish with Garlic Butter and Scallions: Crispy batter fried fish tossed in garlic and butter. Presented with some greens and oranges, looks ravishing.

Roasted Slice Lamb with Thai Chilli: Quantity is good. The lamb is tasty. The chilli bit is controlled and perfect.

Thai Green Curry Prawns with Lemon scented Steamed Rice: The perfect main course ever. I have had tried thai curry various times, in numerous places but this one stood out. The curry had it's own charm, perfect in flavor. The prawn was not under done or over done, was perfect. Definitely recommended.

End your meal wtih darshaan and some ice cream. A good end to your evening.

Visited Host restaurant quite sometime back. There is nothing great about the place. A normal restaurant with typical interior. But the food is worth mentioning. We tried the staple Chinese food there... Chilly chicken and fried rice. I must say it is awesome. If you are in a mood to taste good Chinese food in this part of the city then host is a great option.
