Well, this is like my 2nd home. Alongside nakur chandra nandy(read: pathetic shop keepers and over hyped) and kali charan das, this shop stands out at the price it sells sweets. There are 30rs sweets as well and there are 5rs sweets as well, but price never keeps their quality down. Do visit in the morning if you want to choose from many!!

Went to this place couple of days ago with my friends for a try out. Located near the hedua park and very close Girish chandra dey sweet shop.
With the try of other sweet shops around the corner the expectations from this shop was also very high. So we tried the Rosogolla and Sandesh for our likings. Both were very good and fresh.Â 
A stop here for a try didnt let us down and we went ahead very satisfied.

The name "Subodh Chandra Mullick" is perhaps not much of a buzzword among the sweetmeat shops of Kolkata, and neither it  acquired a status to be the 'talk of the town' among the sweet lovers and dessert aficionados.
 In fact this old sweetmeat shop of North Kolkata, at Ramdulal Sarkar street, happens to be an out and out underrated, unhonoured and unsung place, devoid of the honour it deserves.

If you have a sweet tooth to savour, or looking forward to experience some mouth watering sweets to pamper your taste buds, this place is ready to welcome you with its wide range of delicious offerings. To be honest, the appealing look and the delicious taste of the sweets will make any sweet lover and dessert aficionado to fall for this place. 

May be in the era of aggressive marketing, and the dominance of big shot brands in the market, the name "Subodh Chandra Mullick" is a recessive trait with its limited handful of patrons. But the taste that it serves is sure to leave anyone utterly delighted with a flattering glee on face, and the place deserve to attract more footfall anyday for their delicious offerings.

A very nice place to experience some delicious sweets, to savour your sweet tooth.

Located in Hedua, and near to Nakur, am a big fan of their Lyangcha and Rabdi. Both of them are equally sinful and has been a quality product since a long time now. With so many good names around, this place has a reputation of its own, and rightly so. Their sondesh looks appealing and tastes great as well!

This shop is located next to kalicharan das sweet shop , opposite hedua chaat . The sweets are unique to this shop and have interesting names as well ! There's a sandesh called 'Mother India' which is an crescent shaped sandesh stuffed with pista badam and nuts. The 'Shwarer Thaak' is a square shaped sandesh with malai on top. Their 'Vanilla rosogolla ' is pink in colour , spongy, but very good to taste ! The 'Malpua' is also good . Do visit this place for some amazing sandesh!

This was one of the shops where I landed for my sweet hunt tonight after dinner. I just went there and started trying any random sweet that attracted me.
The taste was good. Everything was in balance, nothing loud. However felt as if the place needed more cleanliness and hygiene.
But it is one of the famous sweet shops around and I guess an old one too.
Not so bad to invest your money here for some treat to your sweet buds.

For years I have had the layered Rabri and then one day I decided to buy some and upon asking a person in her 80's about the best rabri shop in town she immediately advised me to go to 'the lane of Nakur and stop at Subodh Chandra Mullick' and she demanded that I bring back some for her. Located near Bethune College on the first lane after the college ends if walking towards Vivekananda Road one finds the shop on the left-hand side of the lane called ram Dulal Street. Since I was on a mission to get the Rabri I immediately asked him the price of Rabri and bought 500gm of the delicious looking layers of blotting paper like Rabri. I was determined not to get my sweet tooth get the better of me but with all the delicious looking temptations I could not resists taking home some of  the 'cake sandesh' (A particular sweet which looks like a baked cake without icing with its brown outer coatign and the soft kheer like solid mass inside) I usually steer clear of chocolate flavoured sandesh since with so many traditional sandesh on offer but I could not but help myself from getting two chocolate sandesh with a tempting melted chocolate in its center. The rabri at Rs250 a kilogram is probably what the Gods must be having up there in heaven. Creamy, thick and delicious. The layers of reduced milk which vitally makes the rabri of Bengal unique is at its creamiest best in this shop, the thick reduced milk in which the layers float is creamy, smooth and heavenly. The cake sandesh is moist and sweet with the perfectly browned exterior and priced at Rs160 per kilogram. The chocolate sandesh was delicious and priced at Rs6.5 per piece they are worth having. The texture is melt in the mouth and the generous usage of cocoa makes it very desirable. This is the best shop for rabri bar none in town, including some other famous instituitions.
