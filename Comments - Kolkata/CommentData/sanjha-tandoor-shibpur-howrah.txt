An outlet at treat , the food court of avani riverside mall serving mughlai food. we tried CHEESE CHILLI NAAN , GARLIC NAAN , CHICKEN BHARTA and MUTTON ROGANJOSH (4 pcs) from here last week. The preparations were upto standards and portions served well for the price . Can be tried if you want to have indian food here without spending much.

We ordered reshmi kebab there.The food quality was very low. The chicken pieces were cold inside, taste was below average, it took around 200. This kind of low quality food is not expected while there are  awareness in the whole city regarding bad quality non hygienic food in the restaurants.

Located on the food court of avani mall this outlet offers north Indian cuisines at a pocket pinch.. I placed order for their biriyani platter and had been served a decent amount of biriyani along with a minced salad and Boondi raita..
