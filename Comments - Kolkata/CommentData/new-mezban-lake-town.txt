To be really honest if you are literally broke but being a biriyani lover looking to have biriyani within 100 rupees this is the place! Just make sure you don't go inside. Take your packet from outside, go home and enjoy.  P.S: Even if you have 60 rupees you can still have " Egg biriyani" ;)

Great Biryani, I tried both mutton and chicken both tasted wonderful especially at the price range couldn't get a better deal.
Extra pieces of chicken and mutton was also available at very cheap rates go for it

Now, THAT is some good Biriyani. I've tasted Biriyani's from many a countries. 
Pakistani, Arabic and Indian. By far, Mezban's biriyani matches the taste of Lucknow and Delhi. 
I'll even go as far as to say Arsalan and Aminia have nothing at their level.

Kolkata's Rs.70 Chicken Biryani is the best and most economical lunch or dinner you can have in India. There are lot of Biryani stores like this serving Biryani at Rs.70-80.
I visited here one afternoon and tried their Chicken Biryani. Good enough for Rs.70. little bit oily though, still good enough. Quantity was enough to serve one adults appetite. Chicken piece was of good size.
Took their salad at the end. Tomatoes, Onions and Cucumber on a plate for 10 bucks.

Couldn't give more rating as not possible here. I dare anybody who eats here once can't stop eating twice thrice and forever. Biriyani is redefined here can't describe in words. I myself have become addicted to it.  Prices are very economical.
