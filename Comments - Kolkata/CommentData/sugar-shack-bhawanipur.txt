It is a small bakery shop located in Bhawanipur area, near khalsa school. Cakes, pastry different types of desserts are available. No sitting arrangements , so take away is the only option. All items are veg. The place was clean and hygienic. Chocolate cupcakes were good. Pocket friendly.

Sugar Shake is a cake shop located at Bhawanipore.

Ambience is nice & clean.

Service is good.

Tried Monte Carlo, which was delicious and fresh. A must try.

Pocket pinch is reasonable as per quality .

Have tried underwater, barbie cakes and cup cakes.. Fantastic cakes with awesome designs.. Keep up the good work.. Even better for those who don't eat cakes with egg.
