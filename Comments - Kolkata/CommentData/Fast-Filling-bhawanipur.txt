Decent place to stop by if you have less time and want to sit and enjoy the typical road side chaats.
Economic and hygienic as well!

If you're looking for some lip smacking food in Bhawanipur, then you got to be in Fast Filling. Have seen this outlet serve amazing veg food to the foodies for a very long time. Tried their South Indian menu and it was equally good. Kudos to the team for the great work.

 They serve veg food. I tried the veg pasta and Crispy Chilli baby corn. But the problem is they give very little veggies and mushroom in their pasta. And I didn't like their pasta at all. But the Crispy Chilli baby corn was pretty good. But if you are pure vegetarian then you can try out this please once if you go Bhawanipur ever.

The menu is extensive but alas the service extremely poor. First, they took more than 2 hours to deliver in spite of the fact that the delivery address is bhawanipore itself. Second, we had ordered Lasagna and Garlic bread. The garlic bread was okay. The Lasagna was extremely less in quantity and tasted like it was cooked by an amateur. Too much of tomato sauce, with layers of beans that tasted like they had been taken off an Indian curry. And lastly there was one single layer of literally non existent cheese on top. 
They really really need to work on it. Paying like such shirty food is such a waste of money. Totally not worth it

"Accepting your own mortality is like eating your vegetables: You may not want to do it, but it's good for you." - Caitlin Doughty

"Fast Filling began in 2011 in sector V as a trial of faith and confidence of me as a food enthusiast during a successful and fairly stable career in banking finance industry. As you should chase each and every dream of yours, it was also given a shot and we hit the bull's eye!" - told by Master Chef participant and owner of Fast filling Mr. Rahul Gupta.

Being an avid foodie since childhood, He wanted to turned his passion into profession. And hence the journey began of Fast Filling. A very much  down to earth person. A foodie by heart and love to serve people with great foods.

Fast Filling provide a various spread of vegetarian dishes those are simple, yummy and so comforting. It is a fast food joint located in the Bhawanipore locality, next to VNC Spa. You can avail a whole lot of street foods from all over world  which is almost a part of their USP to take us to food journey around the globe.  Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian list can go on and on. And surprisingly all are animal friendly.

¬†

Everything was served with a friendly smile which was very humbling and the taste and quality of food made us appreciate the simplicity in the place. A very small food joint with around 15 covers in ground floor. And the First floor is used as kitchen.

The Dishes We Had :

Virgin Mojito : A refreshing Cuban drink - freshness of mint and bubbly soda! The sweet taste accompanied by fragrance of mint and addition of tangy lime makes it for a really refreshing summer beverage.

Nachos Fiesta : House made Tortilla chips served with Jalapenos, olives, bell peppers and cheese sauce, oven baked; served with sour cream and salsa. These simple, basic nachos are perfect for parties and get-together for kids of all ages.

Stuffed Potato Jackets : Potato 'boats' seasoned with spiced butter, topped with cheese and oven baked, stuffed with Corn-Jalapenos Filling. Fabulous as party appetizers, snacks or light meals, these potatoes are a fun way to eat your vegetables .

Kutchhi Dabeli Pav : The Gujrati Bun! Spicy and tangy potatoes all mashed, smothered with garlic and imly chutney and smeared in sev, chopped onions and pomegranate. Dabeli Pav originated in Mandvi, Kutch during 1960. Dabeli means to press and the potato masala is pressed between a toasted pav bun with other fillings. This is a filling snack and it was really the show stopper.

Mexican Casserole : Mexicans' answer to Italians.. We bake better! Layered with Mexican Rice, the marinated paneer is topped with cheese sauce and baked with cheese.¬†A cheesy comforting casserole that you can enjoy guilt-free. You can‚Äôt beat that!

Mumbaiya Tava Pulav : A Mumbai street food delicacy - steamed rice tossed with veggies and spices on tava and saut√©ed, served with curd.  Basically a street food recipe prepared with pav bhaji masala. Tawa Pulao is a term which all Mumbaikar‚Äôs are well versed with. I can bet there will be not a single person in Mumbai who must have not eaten this dish.  In almost all corners, junctions or roads of Mumbai you will find them.

Cheesy Taco Bowl with Rice : (Entry to MasterChef Auditions this year for our beloved Rahul Gupta - the chef). Taco basket stuffed with cheesy veggies served on bed of herb rice. Really, this dish is quite versatile in its own dimension and flavour. Loved the presentation too

Mexican Pizza : Double layered crispy tortilla stuffed with beans, veggies, rice and of course Cheese! It is a popular & lip smacking creamy cheesy double layer pizza recipe. It is very popular in Mexico. The pizza looks delicious, and is just the type of meal I love. Two tortillas with cheesy stuffing in between make a flaky and flavorful crust. A delightful experience indeed.

Cheese Chilly Garlic Parantha : 2 pc. of Parantha stuffed with cheese, green chillies and garlic served with signature dips! Salsa & Sour Sauce. I am a cheese lover. I L.O.V.E it. To me, nothing tastes better than that. So, its no surprise that I found a way to experience a combination of cheese, chili and garlic into one humble paratha. The fresh cheese especially adds so much flavor to this paratha that it could get addictive. The slight garlic flavor complimented the cheese. No appetite are fussy when it comes to eating these. Mine, sure was the best dinner companion on this particular day....!

Molten Lava Cake : Choco lava 'exploding' from the crust of chocolate sponge cake sitting on the bed of vanilla ice cream scoop. Do you ever have those moments when you want something sweet after such a cheesy spicy dishes ? That‚Äôs where small batch desserts come in super handy.  And can I just tell you something?  These molten chocolate lava cakes may be my favorite small batch desert. It was a pure bliss with vanila icecream.

The food is all freshly made and the price for what you are given is very reasonable.

All in all one of the best restaurants I have been to in recent times.Such good value for money, especially for its location. Would 100% go back,and have recommended to all my friends.

Special thanks to:

Rahul Gupta , Owner - Fast Filling ‚Äì For hosting us so nicely and extending the warm hospitality.

‚óã Rajdeep Bhattacharjee (Gourmets Travel Guide) ‚Äì For inviting us

The service can be termed as an absolute value for money, both in terms of quality and quantity. If you are looking out for having a nice meal without much hassles, this is the place you're looking for. A perfect solution for parties and social gathering. We ordered lunch for our entire team and it turned out just fresh and perfect as we like it! It's a satisfying experience. Thanks to the team and recommended for everyone.

I had a chance to visit this fast food joint when hunting for a quick bite along with my pure veg friend from Gujarat. It resembled a college canteen with a very funky but low-key d√©cor. But the menu card was anything but low-key. Fast food from all the world were on display with pictures and explanations for dim-wits like me. My Gujju friend was ecstatic to find his fav snack, ‚ÄúKutchi Dabeli‚Äù in the menu and promptly ordered it. A single bite confirmed that we had unknowingly hit a treasure trove. The chef was promptly summoned and he confirmed that the masala for the snacks were couriered every week from Gujarat and the lovely breads were specially baked for them.  We immediately went on a ordering spree asking for vada pav, pav bhajji, dahi kachori and raj kachori. When we were totally stuffed, we took some more ‚ÄúKutchi Dabelis‚Äù for parcel. Great menu, lovely taste, good portions, cordial staff, young crowd and quick home delivery system makes this place the Best Veg Fast Food Joint in Kolkata. No more Haldiram‚Äôs for me. Best Wishes to the Fast Filling Team. Looking forward for you to open some outlets in South Kolkata too. Regards, Rupesh Menon

Ordered a Chilli garlic noodle & Chilli paneer through an online food delivery app.

Paneer was not fresh. It was too sweet & tasted weird.
The noodle was below average.

Also, the quantity was not sufficient.

The worst place on the planet because of - 
1. Delivery takes 90mins
2. Fridge Cold Paw Bhaji 
3. 5th grade Corn Cheese Paratha with NOT A DROP of CHEESE in it.  
4.  The owners (both man and lady) are so wrong. They don't know how to treat customers.

Had to walk out of the place after waiting for almost 45 minutes for an order of paneer paratha and chola bhatura....giving a rating of 1 only becoz can't go below than this

Located in bhawanipur, this place is exclusively Vegetarian. In terms of size, the place is too small and stuffy. The interiors are very basic and their kitchen is above the restaurant, so you'd hear a lot of chopping and shuffling noises. As far as delivery is concerned, the place is very irregular at it. I've been delivered yummy hot food as well as cold tasteless food. One thing that disappointed me was water bottles kept at the tables, restaurant should definitely do away with it.
Coming to the food
Though the place is really new and is a small joint, it serves Indian, Chinese,italian and mexican.
Dishes you should try
Mexican sizzler- Sizzling and upto the mark. Ask for the pasta rather than the rice.
Swiss cheese fondue - Not very special but if you feel like fondue, you wouldn't be disappointed.
Cheesy nachos- crispy and perfecto.
Mexican pizza- If you are bored of dominoes and pizza hut.
Parathas- Hot aloo paranthas. Yum.
Veg momos- Regular momos.
Pav bhaaji/ vada pav- If you have no idea what to order go for either, was better served than in many big shot restaurants.
Dabeli- Gujarati burger. Try it if you've never heard of it before , tastes the same as everywhere.
Handi biryani and the chaats are not recommended.
A cheap and medium quality restaurant.

Visited the same place yesterday and the quality has gone down by tonnes.
I had to return back the Raj kachodi. Alfredo pasta had too much of garlic.
Place was dirty and unhygienic.
They did not serve water and the cutlery was dirty as well
Not recommended

Me and My friend came here on a Saturday Evening hoping there will be many people as its the weekend !! But surprisingly, it was empty ! Its really a small fast food joint with co operative staffs ! The didn't have Gratin in their menu, but were ready to cook if requested at a charge of Rs. 240/- which I found overpriced according to this cafe (not sure about its taste).. We ordered a combo of Rs 180/- (chinese bhel, aaloo dum and Victoria vada)..
Chinese bhel was good among all though it was not crispy.
Victoria vada was not at all like Victoria's vada, it was pakoda kinda thing.. and they had only dhaniya ki chutney with it and not the garlic one.
Aaloo dum was ok. A kind of unusual taste in it which was good..
We told the staff about the vadas when he came to ask about the food ! He said they ll make it better the next time we ll visit :)

All over, you can visit this place if you want to spend some time with your friends with some food at reasonable rates :)

Discovered this place in the little app where they were providing a really nice,veg yet really nice deal for two. So I booked the deal and visited the place yesterday evening. We had already notified them about the date and time of our visit and when we reached, we were greeted heartily! The deal included a tomato soup, a pizza or pasta to be chosen from the menu, two cheese garlic breads, hot brownie with ice cream and a pet bottle of cold drinks. That's a lot, especially for a skinny girl and her friend! Anyway, so we chose the cheese lovers' pizza. They served all the items with great care, always asking us if it was all okay! Now about the food, we never really expect much from a tomato soup but the one they served was very cheesy and tasty, even my friend agreed on that. We finished the cheesy garlic breads before we remembered that we should take photos! So you can understand they were pretty nice too! Coming to the pizza, it was a 10" pizza(too large for the two of us) and like we all know, cheese can never go wrong! And the same applies for brownie with ice cream! The deal was really worth it. As for the restaurant, the food was nice, the staff were very friendly, the only things not so well are that it's veg, which again I think is probably justified considering the demand of the area, and it's quite a small place so you don't want to take a very large group there without prior reservation. So overall it was a good experience and I'd like to visit again and try the different varieties of items they have on their menu. And if you are hungry and in the Bhowanipore area, do visit.

A hidden gem in Bhawanipur,a haven for vegetarians who long for good continental fare without burning a hole in your pockets.I had ordered a combination of Mexican and Italian Fare and both were by far close competition to any fine dining speciality chains in the city.To sum it up great food and value for money...

This joint is just 3 buildings away from my home. We had tried their Alu paratha once and really liked the taste. So last night we ordered home delivery for 3 combo Alu parathas which include 2 Alu parathas with raita and chole in each plate. Firstly a plate of Alu paratha and chole was charged at Rs.130 which I found a little overpriced and secondly they charged Rs.60 extra just for the packing and delivery to a place which is 3 buildings away. *surprised*
However the food was tasty :)

5 min Walking distance to padmapukur bhawanipur this joint of Fast Filling is situated beside sisha lounge.
This is Small joint and sitting arrangements for 18 people maximum. Place was clean and ambiance was good. We ordered alfredo pasta and cheese mushroom pasta, both were same taste and quantity wise very well. Staffs were too lazy and after serving food you cannot see one of them they were busy in chitchat with each other. Last we ordered chilli baby corn but that was little bit sweet instead of spicy..

They always deliver on time. A few favourites to try out will be Pyaaz paratha with chola, Mexican rice with tangy veggies and enchiladas. The dabeli is worth trying too. In the new menu one should definitely try the falafel burger.

Fast Filling is a fast food joint located in the Bhawanipore locality, next to ZAF Lounge.

The outlet is spread out over a very diminutive acreage. There is a seating space of atmost 15 people on the ground floor and the kitchen being on the 1st floor. Fast Filling mainly provides Italian, Mexican and Chinese delicacies. But then even Indian food varieties are available.

I went there with a group of friends for lunch. We ordered full meal Chinese combos which included choice of rice/noodles, choice of gravy and an appetizer. We opted for Schezwan Rice and Hakka Noodles with Chilli Garlic Manchurian with Chilli Babycorn as sides. Additionally Cheesy Nachos were also ordered.

The order is quite high at this place. We received the food after around 25 mins. But I must say, the wait was worth it. The quantity of food was satisfactory considering the relatively cheaper price tags. The taste was something more than expected from such a place. All of it was really savory.

Really pleased with the restro. This quality of food being provided at such low rates in an area like Bhawanipore. They also provide home delivery services or so I have heard.

Fast filling is a small and cute eating hub situated right beside Zaf Lounge. The place is cutely designed and proper utilization of space is done too. The menu card may seem abit all over the place but I would suggest you to go with combo offers which provides good food and has value for money too. The only suggestion I would like to provide is that the staff who attended us seemed very confused...so it would be better if you could make them understand the combo offers too. Overall good experience... Would surely visit again..and MUST TRY : Crispy Chilly Baby corn!!!

2. Haka Chow-A little above average.
3. Crispy Chilli BabyCorn- Absolutely Fine for the tongue!
Their welcoming gestures and feel-at-home service brings me almost every week to grab a bite. Only if they could expand a bit !

Don't try the Fresh Lime Soda ! It's no where near what you can guess !

Suddenly i had this craving for dahi phuchka.. So i called them up and ordered for dahi phuchka nd a raj kachori.. They took almost an hr to deliver though they are just a few blocks away from my house. The dahi phuchkas taste was a bit blunt.. They could have given a little more masala , onions nd coriander leaves.  And the raj kachori was ok ok. The kachori was a bit smelly and had become moist.. The taste was also blunt. The imli chutney was missing in both.. The quality of dahi was good. Hopefully when i order next ill be able to give a better review which i wanted to give.. As their presentation was nice..

They serve fine quality authentic food and the best part is there menu is endless. You have so much of choice to order from that you won't get bored even if you visit the place everyday. I am personally a huge fan of chole bhature and crispy chilli babycorn of this place. Full marks for the food and hospitality.

I rarely walk into a Restaurant that sells Vegetarian food especially when it deals with fast food. But amazing experience and I would suggest you to try the Cheese Garlic Dosa. Mixing Italy with Southern India created a master piece. Don't shy away from treating your peeps for a highly unreasonable achievement as it is amazingly pocket friendly.

This is place is a bit small for a get together kind off. However its quite and decent place to hangout with 2-3 frnds and have a small treat from someone's else pocket. Haha. Food here is kind of normal, not those mouth watering.

Amazing food. Loved it. And the place being pure veg with so much to offer is completely awesome. It's amongst the best pure veg restaurant I have come across in Kolkata.

The food is good but the service is very bad. The sizzlers was awesome but sizzling brownie with ice cream was not worth.  There was a cockroach in the chilly flakes shaker . This was a shock to us. I was very disappointed. After having this experience I'm not willing to go to this place again

Located in Bhawanipur (beside Zaf Lounge) this small eatery has been a wonderful discovery. I have been there twice and both times the food and service was brilliant!¬†In my two visits I have ordered the following:¬†

1) Veg steamed momos: Very tasty filling, sweet and spicy sauce, a good dish to begin with¬†
2) Corn cheese quesadillas which were cheesy and tasty, so yum!¬†
3) A mushroom alfredo pasta which was divine (though a little sweet, which can be worked upon)¬†
4) A Veggie Deluxe pizza which was good.
5) Potato jackets which we ordered upon the eager waiters requests. It was nice, though a little overfried, but the ssauce and salsa (hommade) were refreshing¬†
6) Cola float and strawberry smoothie which again was tasty.¬†

The staff is polite and friendly. There are 4 tables, very cramped place but I dont really care much about it, since the food here is amazing!¬†

Coming back again and again!¬†
Great going Team Fast Filling

Best thing about this place : it's really pocket friendly; it's Menu is big enough to choose from. Bad thing is not enough space to accommodate, servicing too slow.

This restaurant is very close to my place so visited it as soon as it opened. The veg momo was just average and the masala dosa was bad! Its a very small place & many may find congested. It also serves chaats, etc which are delicious.

Believing in the management's reply to my earlier review, I ordered a home delivery of masala dosa & I can certainly say, I was dissappointed. For starters, the joint isn't even 2min away but my food was cold, the dosa soggy. The coconut chutney was heavily diluted with water, leaving it tasteless & the quantity served was surprisingly small (30% of a small zipper, which couldn't even suffice for half a dosa). The quality of south indian has gone down hill. One should choose chechis restaurant for better south indian in this area.

Fast filling is a nice place to hang out with friends. The food is nice. The nachos and the cheese sauce was simply yummm :) the other items were good too except the vodka paneer .. What I disliked about the place was the presence of cockroach and mosquitoes inside the restaurant. Since it's an eating joint hygiene should be the first priority of the owners. The waiters are cordial but they do not know there job to well.. (not going into the gory details)
The food was not a let down so I plan to go to this place again.. But hopefully the loopholes shall not be there on my next visit.

Have been twice, i must say food is never disappointing.
The only thing needs to be checked is the cleanliness and regular pest control.
Yesterday i saw many mosquto and some spiders in the table. Even the table were not clean plus its got stinking smell when you enter.

Ambiance has been a total disappointing

Went to this Fast Filling outlet in search of Dabeli and I must say I wasn't disappointed. The madam owner of the Fast Filling franchise quickly got into a discussion with me on a wide range of things starting from why I love Dabeli to why she is soon gonna ensure the availability of Dabeli across all outlets of Fast Filling soon. The Dabelis (4 nos.) were served in about 20 minutes and the taste was good albeit a bit too spicy. But they also make less spicy ones and that's the one I had to bring for my mom who can't handle spice. The staff and the owner madam are extremely friendly and she even promised me that Dabeli will feature in their Salt Lake outlet and the Mani Square outlet soon and until then I can't wait! 

For those wondering what's a Dabeli, it's in very simple terms, a Gujju Burger without pattice but stuffing made out of mashed potatoes. Must try next time you visit this Fast Filling outlet.

Went extra mile for buying Dabeli ( a western india - Ahmedabad originated street food) for my wife at this place. It was thoroughly enjoyed by my wife. Only place which i am aware of which serves Dabeli in kolkata, and a pretty close reach to dabeli's origin .
Well would definately recommend this small joint but definately worth visiting.

Have you ever got the feeling that the person taking the order is looking right at you and wants to ask Which Planet are you from ? That us what happened with me after a sleepover at a friend's place on Friday. Well four of us slept the entire day on Saturday and woke up around 7 in the evening. U was hungry as hell, So zapped a few buttons and zomato pointed a nearby joint. I was in a mood to eat something chatpata.

So we rushed to Fast Filling and went inside. First impressions were good. Nice decor and space management. I would have rated this place 3 but the Bombay Vada Pao saved the day.

So the order began

4 Butter Pav Bhajis with extra pav later
2 Bombay Vada Pav
1  Mumbai Grilled Sandwich
Plain Idlys
3 Dahi Phuchkas
And some more.

The guy taking the order smiled and said Anything else. Which he meant by the way " Aliens ".

Pav Bhaji was good, as was the sandwich. The show stopper was the Bombay Vada Pav and the fresh chatney. I mean wow. The Dahi Phuchkas were great too.

Idly was fresh but the sambhar and coconut chatney were a turn off.
I noticed water was kept in coke bottles which was not professional at all. The staff needs a little bit of training like to serve water. Since one of us had to literally shout for it when I mistakenly crunched a chilly.

And mind you, if you like the chatney that comes along with the vada pav, and ask for some more. Then the next top up comes a little diluted. ( Water Addon )

Will try the other outlet to see how they are. Adios till then.

I went with high hopes since l had already ordered once from there,and the food had been good. First of all,it  had been good this time around too. I had some momos which were excellent but the chaats were blah. I would advise take-away since the seating place is ridiculously small and while I was eating it felt like the waiters were observing our every move. And NEVER order the cold drinks inside. Its preposterously overpriced and their lame excuse was that their was an AC there(and I do not think it was even on).Something else that I did not like was that they gave us the bill  the second we said that we did not want anything else to eat. Its normal courtesy for a customer at a dine-in  to be presented with the bill AFTER he has 
finished eating. So to round it off,good for takeaway but bad for dining.

Location: Right beside ZAF Lounge.

This Vegetarian joint opened doors to it's customers a couple of weeks back.
And, since then has been bringing smiles to the customer's tummies and pocket.
Dropped by this joint on my evening rounds today.
This place has been quite strategically planned out,¬†a small joint with three tables on the ground floor itself and kitchen on the¬†first floor.
The ambiance is simple and the d√©cor has been thoughtfully executed.

Straight to the Fooding, ordered for the following:

Classic Nachos
The dish was nice to taste. Nachos topped with cheese, chopped tomatoes & capsicum served along with re-fried beans and salsa dip as sides.
Loved it. :)

Crispy Chilli Babycorn
An Indian take on the Chinese dish.
Tasted decent.
Lacked the spiciness I had requested for.

-These were ordered from their Inaugural Menu.
-A plus in the fooding field, this place would happily serve a specific request made by you out of the menu just to bring a smile on your face.

A pocket friendly affair it was.
The staff was courteous but, needs to be trained and briefed about the menu.
The service was quick.
-Amazing warmth and hospitality by the owners. :)
-Negatives have been personally put across the owner. Hope it's taken care of in the forthcoming days. :)

A good experience.
-Would be visiting soon to try out the remaining fare and I do await the regular menu with the inclusion of other dishes.
-Hope to see this joint continue with it's consistent services, improve on it's quality with each passing day and live upto it's mantra, "Good Food, Great Fun". :)

A great option for Vegetarian Chinese, Italian & Mexican food. They are starting South Indian & Chaats pretty soon, A very pocket friendly joint. Momo is a must & a sure shot winner! There is a scope for improvement in service though but the food quality is top notch. An outlet which you will visit regularly. Kudos!

My son loved the baby corn also I never realized veg momos could be so tasty. A must visit.

I ordered 60 packets of breakfast and lunch for my company cricket match. It turned out extremely nice. For breakfast got us a sandwich, a cutlet, a brownie one dhokla along with one glass of juice. The lunch included Alu paratha with dahi and tawa pulao with chola. Guys loved it. We are Sticking to them for next time.
