Hi all please don't try this restaurant, especially biriyani and all rice staffs. They are not serving fresh food. The rice even served hot would become hard while eating and the mutton or chicken might smell. The food quality has drastically fallen like anything. Expecting stomach ache anytime...

As it was a rainy day, we thought of ordering food from this nearby restaurant. We had ordered cheese nun, butter nun, chicken butter masala and chicken bharta. Cheese nun was okayish. Chicken bharta tasted good and chicken butter masala was the best among all of them. Quantity and quality is great.

tandoor items are good. many of the menu items are not available most of the time though. what is always available are the common items only. ambience is casual. nothing special. but neat and clean.

Sometimes even the most appreciable restaurants are left unnoticed. South-Calcutta is blessed with some remarkable restaurants which the maximum crowd is still unaware of. Food Villa is one such hub for food lovers that serve delicacies and quality service. Situated in Budge Budge Trunk road, in Mollargate, Food Villa has extra-ordinary dishes to offer its customers. It is a fully air conditioned restaurant. Food Villa is a perfect admixture of cheap rates and taste. The perfect ambience with a soothing music playing background will easily lift up oneâ€™s mood. If you are in South Kolkata and still not visited Food Villa then you should make some plans soon enough. It offers savoring dishes at reasonable rates.
