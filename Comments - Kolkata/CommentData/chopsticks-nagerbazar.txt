For those who are health conscious,  Chopsticks is an ideal destination . Ordered Mixed noodles via Swiggy and received the same right on time. It came in two large containers-the first container contained noodles and the second one came with their signature hot  gravy. Now, first coming to the gravy in the second container, it appeared to me as hot mixed soup consisting of cabbage,  carrot,capsicum, finely chopped chicken pieces with fried egg pieces. But after tasting it , it felt awesome with noodles. Completely bowled over by as after a long long time, had yummy noodles with my younger sibling. Kudos Chopsticks!

Pathetic food. They also missed to send one item when ordered through swiggy. Complete waste of money. The quality of the noodles were very poor.

Good food. Very pocket friendly. Management is also very hospitable . Chicken manchow soup and schezwan chicken is to die for. Space is less, cash n card both are accepted.

I personally haven't visited the restaurant but I order food from here quite more than often(Thanks to swiggy)..
The food is awesome and really leaves you wanting to get more..Whether its momos or noodes or rice or soups-you can blindly order anything and be rest assured that you will be devouring all of the food.
Personally I prefer the chicken sweet corn soup which is loaded with chicken.
Crispy chilly mushroom is another favourite..Coming to mains,the noodles is sooo sooo yummmy...I would request everyone to try their gravy noodles once..Chicken in schzewan sauce and veg manchurian is another hot favorite..
The portion sizes are more than good,so its nice that something is left for next days breakfast also..

Been there during the pujas with a group of friends, and unexpectedly it was quite good. The service was better than expected, since it was during the Pujas, and the food too.
Recommended!!

After making Pulao at home for guests, I was too lazy to prepare the side dishes. So I ordered a Paneer Manchurian and a Garlic Chicken from Chopsticks. For the price, the quantity was good. They were nicely packed.
But the food wasn't satisfactory. The paneer and chicken pieces were in good size. But both of them were hard. The garlic chicken had no taste of garlic at all. There was good amount of gravy but it lacked a good taste.

I came across this joint on Swiggy. Didnot get the opportunity to visit the place. However reviews state that the place is cosy and comfortable.
Had ordered for Manchurian fried rice and szechwan chicken (gravy).
I was over pleased with the menu offered on Swiggy.
Manchurian fried rice is something which all local chinese restaurants dont serve.
The fried rice tasted a lot like szechwan fried rice but with less or no spice.
It was a bit dry and it had a smell of boiled rice sauted with vegetables and chicken.
Was not very pleased with the rice. My all time favourite is still Peiping restaurant Park Street.
Manchurian fried rice was amazing and I still miss the taste.
To me it was authentic Manchurian Rice.
Well now about the Szechwan Chicken. It was undoubtedly better than expected.
Chicken was well cooked and melted in the mouth. It was juicy and fresh.
The gravy was really amazing and it enhaced the taste of the rice.
I am happy I made a good choice of both the items.
Would really like to appreciate them for this.
I am a satisfied customer. Kudos to you Guys.
Please try to make the authentic Manchurian Fried rice and then this restaurant will be my next fav chinese restaurant.
Looking forward to try other items.

Its located near tank no. 2 in Dum Dum park. Looks nice from outside and its a warm and a cosy place. Coming to the food it is just about OK. Chicken drumsticks are hard. Not good. Staff is very lazy and rude. Many items in the menu were not available. Its a normal phenomenon. The lemon chicken was just not up to the mark. They are always unable to serve momo...God knows why it is in the menu. It is located near my house so tried the place second time hoping a better response but alas !!!

Ordered Noodles and it was delivered hot and well made. Nothing extraordinary, but nothing disappointing as well. Would definitely make a visit to the place to check out the in house ambience and service.
Budget friendly as well.

Well another one just near my home specialized in Chinese cuisine.. What I like abt them is the light food quality they maintain.. Also quantity wise it's quite decent one plate is sufficient for two.. They have a small sitting arrangement for dine in as well which is decorated with Chinese art works ..sweet n simple.. I had visited them quite a no. of occasions and a homely feeling makes me comfortable that may be my locality... All in all a decent local restaurant to have food from if you like Chinese. Try them out.
