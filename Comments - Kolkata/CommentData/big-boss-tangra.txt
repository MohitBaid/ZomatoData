Situated in Tangra, its a very famous name in China Town. It has a vast parking area. It‚Äôs very spacious. Good for big accommodations. It‚Äôs well decorated and well lighted. Coming to the food I think it serves one of the best Chinese food in that area. The food tastes very delicious. The place is very hygienic as well. Service is also very satisfying. Good place to go with family and friends.

Awesome place... Known place in chaina town.. We ordered crispy chicken stick for starter and its really good.. Main course we ordered chicken fried meifoon and chili prawn ü¶ê.. Meifoon is good well cooked and 1dish is enough for two people. Chili prawn is also very good.. Staff are well behavior and polite..

Definitely a good place. A feel of China from the appearance and inside ambience. 
Decent crowd, families and lot more
Amazing stuff with crisp starters and mouth watering main course. 
Alcohol to accompany if you are alcoholic
Tried One masala drink which was amazing. 
Must try if you are in mini China of calcutta.

situated at Tyangra, a popular  name in china town served  good quality Chinese food.  we have crispy fried fish, hot and sour chicken soup, chicken fried rice, chilli chicken. crispy fried fish was crunchy outside and soft and juicy inside. The fish was fresh. I love chilli chicken with the crunch of onions.  but they served chilli chicken without onions. so I didn't  like it too much. The amount  of the dishes was enough

Been there several times from childhood but now the quality of food has gone down big time. The only good thing about this restaurant in tangra is the place is a treat to your eyes only. Good seating, ample space, huge parking, nice decor. Food is not at all good. It lacks the typical tangra taste. We ordered:
Golden fried prawn: below avrg
Lung fung soup - just ok
Mixed gravy cantonese noodles: bad
Mixed fried rice: below average
Garlic chicken: bad
Chilli prawn: just ok.
If you love the chinese from tangra or park street restaurants... avoid this hotel. If yiu want to enjoy cheap booze with starters... you can choose this place.

Used to be one of my go-to places. However, the food quality and service have dropped alarmingly. They took 40 minutes to get a normal starter even though there was only one other table in the entire restaurant which was occupied apart from ours. The noodles was too oily and was barely edible. Laid back waiters who had no clue about which table had ordered what only added to the misery. The 1.5 stars is only out of prior good experiences and the decent sweet corn soup.

A good place to dine with ur friends as well as with your family. The schezwan fried rice & kun fao chicken is a must try at this place. The ambience & the service are too good to be compared to other restaurants. In fact the manager approached us & told us about the order that we placed would be too much for us & hence we made some changes in our order.

We have been here on this 25th December, I understand the crowd will be more than as usual. But as my friend said to one of the waiter when he asked for tips, "If you have opened the restaurant, then expect a little more no. of people than any other day because it is the Christmas Day, but service should not be compromised." We ordered a chicken starter, instead of 6 pieces, we were served with 5 pieces. When we informed they said that they will serve it with the main course that we have ordered. But oops we didn't get it till now. While billing they were offering us a scoop of icecream for that missing piece. But we refused because CHICKEN AND ICECREAM are not same thing! Mixed fried rice is what we ordered, rice was not properly cooked! Not boiled enough. Hot garlic Prawn was also not up to the mark! 
I expected a little better service from this restaurant. 
Disappointed!

A good, spacious Chinese restaurant at Tangra with delicious food, nice decor and lots of car parking space. Waiters are laid back, however, making the service experience below average. Probably the waiters are unionised with typical Bengal work culture.

I have visited Big Boss with my family and friends many times. The food rarely disappoints. Today I visited with 3 friends and had some drinks, fish fingers, Tom Yum soup, Chinese chop suey and mixed vegetables. Portions are generous and all dishes were tasty as usual.

The non-availability of pork dishes is disappointing. I was under the impression that pork is an integral part of Chinese food.

This is quite a popular place to all the Chinese lovers. Great cosy comfy ambience.but the food was a disappointment. We had ordered drums of heaven and manchow soup. The broth was tasty with just the perfect blend of spices but the chunks of mushrooms, chicken and prawn didn't seem to have the proper Infusion of the spices.. They were just boiled pieces.. The dreams of heaven was not upto the mark as the chicken was not perfectly cooked from inside. HOWEVER services were prompt and very satisfying

Big space almost 3 floored building to accomodate people more than 300.
The food is okayish compared to the other restaurants of Tangra but is most cost effective for a dineout with group.
Booze here has enough options as you can order bottle wise and prices are cost-effective.
The food is okayish as i mentioned and quality has degraded since its inception over the years !
The owner is quite friendly and overall a nice place.
Ambience is on the off side as when it is overcrowded it may be become a bit noisy and rowdy in peak times.

They say if you are looking to booze and some authentic Chinese food, the best place to go to is china town, and big boss is one if the pioneers in china town.

Went there for a weekday lunch on tuesday afternoon.

I had ordered lut me chicken, thai fried fish and roasted chilly duck with a bottle of old monk.

Thai fried fish was crispy and delicious, I must say it was cooked really good and so was the chicken. Both the dishes were spicy.

I expected the roasted duck to be whole jn shape but it was served in pices.

Overall the experience was good although I feel that the ambience can be better.

This has to be my most disappointing meal this year. The only perk of visiting this place is the ample parking space, things went steadily downhill from there. The ambience and decor is ordinary. We started with sweet corn soup - completely unseasoned, with undercooked corn, it was like trying to gulp down boiled water. The crispy fried chicken turned out to be small pieces of limp chicken cutlet, nothing crispy about them I can assure you. Dragon prawn appeared on the table with no shred of dragon sauce on them.
We moved on to a mind-numbingly dull main course from there with nixed hakka noodles - your ordinary fare of fried greasy noodles, easily available at 50 bucks per plate in any road-side shanty. Accompanied by a sickly sweet garlic prawn, nothing garlicky about them. Moreover, the chicken pieces, which were coated with flour, tasted sour and stale.
By the look and location of this place, people usually drop by here just for booze after office-hours. With so many exciting pan-Asian places coming up in the city, I regret chosing this one for a family outing.
So, 2 points for the bland edibles. -0.5 for the complete lack of imagination.

Be it Duck or chickens or lamb or anything I have no complaints about the food quality and taste. But I won't recommend Duck here though. Chicken is best here. The Starter menu is great. Yet the Soup variety is not up to my expectations from this place. Come on variety is the spice of every foodie. Overall yeah a great place to eat and chill üòç

This is my first visit to China Town. Hence I'll not be able to give a good comparison with the other restaurants in China Town. But, you can definitely give a visit to this place. I went for my pre-birthday lunch. 
The ambience was good.The service was also good and above all these, this restaurant is very pocket friendly. 
Now, lets come to the food..
1) We had taken Mixed Lung Fung Soup.It has a bit thick consistency. Consists of chicken, mushroom,carrot, egg, prawn. It was delicious. Small serving is enough for two persons. 
2)Dragon Chicken- Although the waiters mentioned that its their one of the signature dishes, I didn't like it much. Too much oil and spices were in the dish. Besides, you can have it as a side dish with fried rice, if you donot like much gravy items as a side dish like me.  :) Half plate consists of 6pieces of chicken. 
3) Pepper Chilli Chicken- I liked this one. Its not that much spicy like the previous one. The pepper gave it an added taste. The chicken was soft too. Half plate consists of 6pieces of chicken.
4) Mixed Fried Rice- It has an authentic chinese flavour infused in it. The quantity was more than sufficient for two persons. It consists of veggies, prawn, chicken and egg. The prawns in it tasted so good.
 You can definitely go to this place with family, friends and with your loved ones. :)

Good food. But menu should be change more mushroom and veg dishes should be introduced. Prawn chips were not fried properly. Service is becoming slower. Overall conclusion is food is good but the service and quality of food is degrading. Because when i ordered hot n sour soup and tom yum soup, prawns were not fresh even in other food items.

I've been here twice.. big boss has always been a comfortable place with a large seating area. And a private place for party too. We started with chicken kebabs, prawns and then machow soup. Then for main course we had chicken fried rice, fish with vegetable, chili chicken,hunan chicken.prices were pocket friendly n I must say this the place at China Town where you can get a bottle of alcohol at reasonable price in recent past!!

Heard one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. But the expectations went to vain. We have had a group of 7 people. We had an experience of poor service, poor food quality with no taste in it. Ambience is like Roadside dhaba. Even the manager is unprofessional, he was trying to ignore us for the wrong order placed to us.
I wonder why the restaurant is hyped. I will never recommend anyone to this place.

I am very much attracted to chinese cuisine.. and the name which first used to come in my mind was Big Boss.. 
I had visit them many a times but such things never happened with me.. 
Last time i had a bitter experience.. first of all i had to wait for 2 hrs as we were 14 in number.. then they informed us that they cannot serve anything related to noodles..
This is was something which no one can ever believe.. a chinese restaurant like big boss is short of noodles.. a road side stall will never get short of their main food items.. 
Anyways still we managed it.. so we had to order rice and other side dishes.. which were not up to the mark..
From that day the restaurant which topped my favourite list came down to the bottom of it..

Probably the best in Calcutta after mainland China . Specially green pepper fish and golden fried prawn. Grt hospitality.  A big car parking facility.

I've been here twice.. big boss has always been a comfortable place with a large seating area. And a private place for party too. We started with chicken kebabs, prawns and then machow soup. Then for main course we had chicken fried rice, fish with vegetable, chili chicken,hunan chicken.prices were pocket friendly n I must say this the place at China Town where you can get a bottle of alcohol at reasonable price in recent past!!

Worst place for Dining-out!!!
Heard one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. But the expectations went to vain. We have had a group of 7 people. We had an experience of poor service, poor food quality with no taste in it. Ambience is like Roadside dhaba. Even the manager is unprofessional, he was trying to ignore us for the wrong order placed to us.
I wonder why the restaurant is hyped. I will never recommend anyone to this place.

Good Chinese/Thai food at reasonable rates. We ordered red pepper chicken, golden fried prawns, Thai fried chicken and chicken munchow soup. The food was yummy and portions were pretty good. We ordered half plates of all the starters and medium for the soup. 
The place was full around 2pm on a Sunday and the service was bit slow possibly due to the crowd size. The parking space is huge here which is a plus given China town has narrow lanes.
China town itself is a must visit in Calcutta and while there are many options to choose from, you can definitely give this place a try.

One of the better ones in the 'China town' of Calcutta. Do try their dragon chicken which is basically a variant of the chilly chicken. The prawn papad is flavourful. The fried rice were slightly undercooked and the noodles were bland. The prawn in hot garlic sauce was not really spicy. The chicken schezwan gravy is good. Wouldn't really recommend this place for the price and setting in which it is located.

The biggest restaurant in China Town "THE BIG BOSS". But the fiod quality is not that big as the name suggests. Though it is d biggest restaurant in Tangra, its service, its food quality are not at all appreciable.We ordered dry pepper chicken, Fish Fry, mix noodles and fried rice with two gravy items. Taste was not upto the mark. Was dissapointed with the taste.Ambience was average. If you are looking for the food quality, then this restaurant is not the correct choice.

Overall:
Food: 2
Service: 2
Crowd: 2
Ambience: 2.5
Pocket Pinch: 3

The food was good. We ordered a simple egg fried rice with some sort of a weird fish dish which was drenched in garlic sauce. I can't remember the name of the dish as food is probably the last thing you would order on a Friday night that too in China town. But on the whole, it was a satisfying meal.

Now, coming to the liquor part. If you are willing to drown yourself in alcohol, then please visit some other place, as every alcohol on the menu card is double it's MRP price. On top of that, they provide only a single serving of the most dreadful "chana chur" available in the market as a side to the alcohol.  

¬†You will end up spending two times more than your expectation.  

The waiters were extremely unprofessional. After paying god knows how many different types of taxes, these ill-mannered characters demanded a tip. 

I would definitely visit this place again but just for the food.

Hooped in with my family n We ordered

Starter :

Chilly garlic pepper fish - loved it
Chilly garlic prawn- great.
Dragon chicken- really great feast of flavours
Fried thai prawns- certainly its has a great brust of flavour not just a boring fried prawns.
mixed thai soup- best appetizer it's refreshing

Main course :

Mixed Cantonese noodles- quality n quantity great
Mixed sechwan fried rice- not the best of sechwan but they serve a filling quantity .
Chilly chicken - bit okayish , could have been better.
Today it was bit salty but on other day its quite good.
Sweet n sour chicken-it was also good in taste but not a thumbs up for all

Although on my view starters are way more great in taste than the main course.

Probably a better place to go to with your family as this place has ample parking space and the seating area is also better than Beijing.
Coming to food, we ordered the dragon chicken(lovely) and shredded chicken (decent) portion size was good as we had ordered 3 plates each of the starter and a large chicken sweetcorn soup(we were 10 in all and everyone was able to have 3/4 of a bowl full of the soup).
For main course, we had ordered for the mixed fried rice(good), mixed hakka noodles(great) and mixed chowmein (good). This was followed by shanghai chicken (tasty) and hunan chicken (quite good).
Overall the food quality was much better than that of Beijing and Golden Joy.
However one problem we faced was that we had to keep asking the server to serve us the  food even when the restaurant was not even half full. This was the only annoying thing. Apart from that this place is a must recommend if you plan a China town visit

One of my all time favourite family restaurant. Good and fresh food. Nice ambience. Always nice experience in the main restaurant i.e front portion. But when ever they send you to the back portion of the restaurant when the front portion becomes full, experience is not good at all for the slow service and lack of coordination between staffs. I must mention the fresh taste of prawn chips they serves which I think the best prawn chips in China Town.

It's good, kind of pocket friendly for a sorted drinking scene.
Alcohol is served as bottles (180, 350) rates are a little higher than MRP. around 100 on a quarter.
Food is very good, won't say authentic Chinese, as it anyways won't suit our taste buds, but yes it's definitely good with Indian spices. Have option to smoke outside of dining area.
All over a good place to be with you chilled out buddies. Not for sophisticated ones.

This was the third time I have been here.
This place has a great ambience with a lot of free space for car parking. 
In a normal day you will definitely get a place to sit but today, wasn't one of those normal days.
Luckily we got a place to sit.
We ordered Crispy Fried Chicken, Prawn chips,Golden Fried Prawn and Chicken Sweet corn soup for starters.
Though it took a lot of time to serve,almost more than an hour but it was delicious and tasted amazing.
For the main course we ordered ,hakka noodles which was less salty, Cantonese noodles,Oyster chilli chicken,chilli fish and Manchurian chicken.
Today,unfortunately it took a lot of time to finish our meal because they served very late,due to a lot of crowd.
Altogether it was a good experience for me.
The photos are attached below.
I hope I could help my dear foodies with my review.
Thankyou @Bigboss for the great ambience and food.
Lastly I would like to request all my dear foodies to try out Crispy fried chicken and Oyster Chilli Chicken

After a long time I went for a lunch at China town on occasion of Durga Puja the most awaited festival in kolkata,and only one place I could have thought in China town and that is Big Boss...Well about the decor of this place, it‚Äôs actually kind mandarin decoration with Indian style. The place was almost full when we entered there but we managed to get a seat there. Because of the festival they didn‚Äôt have lot of options on their menu as they usually have. Most of the items were average in taste and service was not that good on that very day. But I won‚Äôt complain about their service because of festive season. The place is a nice joint to have lunch with family and friends during festival. But I would say the experience is satisfactory. Recommend, will visit again but not during festival, I want their best possible menu with hospitality...

My recommendations will contain crispy chicken, hot garlic chicken, honey chicken ( a bit different from the rest ) and the mixed rice. The bar is good for serving regular drinks. However, if you are a fan of premium quality liquors or cocktails then this may not be the best place of choice for you. The ambience and service is nothing special.

Have been going to this restaurant almost every month. The quality and service was very good until yesterday. We checked into the hotel around 4pm. First we ordered for 2 chilled bottles of water which came after the snacks. My father ordered for a drink which came after the main course. We found hair in our meals and the parcel that we took home contained a much lesser quantity of food which we ordered. Didn't expect such a bad service from them.

The quality of food has degraded drastically... Inspite of specific instructions given to the chef regarding applying less oil in the dishes, it was not followed... All the dishes were too oily... Some beyond the point of consumption... The 1.5 star is only given for the decor and serving... Not at all satisfied with the food quality... This brings forward the downfall of Big Boss‚Äôs quality compared to it‚Äôs rival restaurants...

Starter was too oily. It is not about calories and that shit but it was too much really.
The gravy noodles was a mistake because it was not that great and under seasoned. The hot garlic fish was just about fine. Could not taste much except ginger which was too overpowering.

Service was swift. The pocket pinch ~ 900

It was a dine out for 6 of us. After voting between Golden Joy and Big Boss , Big Boss won.
The place is not new to food lovers of kolkata. The place is huge. The resturant is divided into two section. We choose the 2nd section. Saturday night was totally crowded. Decore is nothing much ti talk about. Coming to the food.
We ordered Dry chilli chicken, prawn chips , drums of heaven, vodka with orange juice , beer and breezers for the starter. For the mains we had mixed chowmine, mixed maifoon , mixed fried rice. Chilli garlic fish, Singaporean chicken. Full plate has 12 chicken or fish. The quantity was huge. Taste was not the greatest. Don't go if you are looking for authentic Chinese flavour. They have Indianised to such a level that they do not serve pork dishes. Dry chilli chicken and maifoon was the star of the evening. The worst one was the drums of heaven to much salt , had a stale flavour in the sauce.
Booze are cheap as compare to other restaurants. This place is good for hanging out with friends have some drinks and couple of foods.

Went to this place for lunch on a Sunday. The restaurant is huge yet it was almost full. We ordered Thai chicken soup, Dragon chicken, Cantonese noodles and chili mushroom.
The soup was superb and so were the mushrooms. But I did not like the dragon chicken and Cantonese noodles. The dragon chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste and the Cantonese noodles felt a bit dry.
Prices were very pocket friendly but service was very very slow. Will visit again to try out some of their other signature dishes.

Situated in tangra, an area which is well known for their authentic Chinese cuisine, my family and I went for a quiet lunch on a Monday afternoon. The area is huge and it is very famous for their vast area of parking lot, both for cars and two wheelers. The restaurant is equally big as well and can fit easily about 60 or more people.

The gate is very nice, gives a little Chinese touch to the entire feel. Also, just opposite of the gate is a statue of a Chinese emperor. Sadly, I do not know it's name. The service is actually quite prompt and the management was good on its part. If you're a Chinese and you're in a mood to eat some pork, please ask the manager for the Chinese version of the menu card. They also have another menu which has both English and Chinese words for more easier access.

Let's come to the food section. For drinks we ordered fresh lime soda, there are a wide range of alcohol available but we didn't order any. We started with thread chicken. Absolutely delish. Then manchow soup. Equally delicious. Then for main course we ordered for chicken fried rice, chicken hakka noodles, full plate chilli chicken, pork with vegetables, fish with vegetables and mapo tofu. 

All of us were really disappointed with how much pork they have used, we literally couldn't count them. It was filled with vegetables. Same with the fish but it was better than pork at least. Overall, the soup and starters were really good but I wish they pay a little bit more attention to their overall food quality. And I hope in the future they use some more pork in their dish instead of putting of money in the dish. It's not value of money.

But if you're in need of some cheap booze in the town and wanna spend a nice time, I suggest you to visit here. You might like it.

I have been to Big Boss many times, but everytime I am busy to enjoy the food. This time i managed to click a picture of the starter only. I orderded for Drum of Heaven in starters, Mixed hakka noodle as staple and hunan chicken(half) in side dish. In terms of quantity always Big Boss rocks. Now coming to taste; the outer coating of Drums of heaven was cripsy and tasty and inside was juicy, Mixed hakka noodle was good in taste as normal but too much of oil i must say and coming to hunan chicken the taste was so so. In other places also i had Hunan Chicken which was sweet n chilly in taste. But here the taste was blunt. Now interior of the restaurant is too good and ambience also good. Ample of parking space, if u take ur car at almost 9 or 9:30 u will get parling space. Also, the attendants were courteous and nice, served the food in time and also hot. Recommended restaurant, for friday night Chinese fun. This restaurant also serves alcohol, if u want u can enjoy tht too...

Heard a lot about this place but service was pathetic. We were in a group, they earned a lot of revenue but they did not bother to provide a good service. Nobody responded when they were called. As if we were not there.  We ordered mainly starters, only dragon chicken was eatable. You dare not order fried wantons and chilli garlic pepper chicken.Food was average, not that you want to go back again for the food. Only thing good is the ambience. Atleast better than some other restaurants in china town. Pros-free parking and nice smoking zone.

Nothing remarkable about the restaurant. I'd term this  as a quick neat clean(I discount the kitchen I didn't check) indian Chinese dhaba. Nothing will give you any exclusive feel. Be happy with a belly full. 
My advise dont go by the reviews they are deceptive. The so called marquee dish .. can be a major disappointment. Order simple check and eject.
Certainly not worth a long travel.
Golden prawn is what I will term prawn bhaji in Pune. Name is deceptive. Korean dishes will light up the rear end of bland raw fish eating Koreans. 
Personally disappointed but my neighbors were enjoying their meal the place was packed in weekend.
To each his own.

The name itself defined quality at China Town in yester years but now I think with time the charm has faded a bit. Foods are okayish... Prices were pocket friendly in recent past. This is where u can get a bottle of alcohol at reasonable price in a restaurant.

Quite a spacious restaurant on the 2nd floor of a building inside Tangra Area of Kolkata with adequate multi level parking area. This is the¬†same neighbourhood which reverberated with Chinese population some decade and a half back. It used to have a distinct 'leather-like' smell in its air which was the signature of this place. Of course, in 2017 those are all a part of history, a past perhaps well forgotten by many with passage of time.¬†The Chinese have retreated at least from this place. Many moved out of the city permanently. Today it is a far more commercialised than ever. 

Frankly I don't remember ¬†if I had ever been in this particular restaurant; even if I did in the past, I am sure all the restaurants in this area have changed beyond recognition. I was a part of a group having 15 diners. So¬†neither did we¬†try signature dishes nor any exotic ones! 

Our order was more simplistic, a combination of chicken noodles and¬†rice¬†with ¬†Chicken¬†& ¬†Prawn gravy as accompaniments. I quite liked the taste of all the food we had.¬†The quantity was also adequate. The only¬†observation was the tardy service of the waiters who often trudged with a tired and unhappy expression. Apart from this, the Mens' washroom was in a bad shape, with wet floor. Every thing else¬†was hunky dory.

My favourite food joint in China Town
May be the biggest restaurant in Kolkata.
This place is huge, ample space for parking,

Coming to food.Bigboss never disappoint me.with their food.

We order

1.Paper chilli garlic chicken(large i.e 12-16 Pcs) -my favorite dish from big boss, soft tender juicy fried chicken chunks sauted with garlic and chilli taste sinful.

2.Dragon chicken(large ) - was good chicken prices sauted in sauce and cashews.

For mains
1. 2 mixed Fried rice - fried rice was awesome light,fragrant rice wok tossed with ample amount of chicekn prawn and eggs.
2. Mixed schezuwan noodles : Noddle was bit spicy and lill greasy.
3.Shanghai chilli chicken(large) : perfect accompaniment for fried rice.

We ended our dinner with vanilla ice cream with fruit cocktail.

The place is very affordable, we 6 friends went for dinner and the bill came up to total Rs.2100 and the portion they serve is huge. Service was average may be bcs it was a Sunday.

Must try Dish:
Chilli garlic peeper chicken.

Special tip- You must visit them on Chinese new year week . You will get to try out their special menu, maximum of which were family owned recipes and will feel the warmth of the Chinese culture.

I always heard about this huge eatery in tangra from friends and colleagues and so decided to check it out with my friend pallav roy. Though the surroundings are not so clean the restaurant itself is clean and spacious with a great parking facility. We started with fried prawn wantons, though the outer coating was little on the sweter side,yet it tasted awesome, the rice noodles and fungchang chicken came next...rice noodles were just too good, nicely tossed and salted ,it was soft .... fung chang chicken was a new dish for me..moderately spicy,it had the right amount of tanginess for my taste buds,we had fresh lime soda to polish off the lunch and it was pretty nice too..  all in all a nice experience ,though i expected a slightly better service as it was a little slow... :)

The most well known restaurant of China town in tangra. The range of dishes and the pricing is pretty average. Ambience and decor wise not that great either. But it makes it up with its huge dining area, moderately good quality yet more than enough quantity of food. We had the following items:
Starter: Dragon fish - soft tender fish cooked in tangy sauce and mild spices. Great combination. (12 pieces in full plate, 6 in half plate but there was more 12, perhaps 18)
Main dish : chicken schewan fried rice, chicken Cantonese noodles. The fried rice was delicious and upto the mark. The quantity is enough to serve 2 adults and a child. The noodles was alright.
Side dish:  Fung Chang Chicken. This dish was packed with surprises and definitely worth your mine. Quite different from your regular Chinese dishes. It came with mushrooms and capsicum with a mild but longlasting spicy taste. The tinge of salty and lingering tangy taste enhanced the overall flavour. The half plate consists of 6 pieces which is enough for 2-3 person. Recommended dish.
Dessert: vanilla ice cream, strawberry ice cream and fresh lime soda. The desserts are pretty much the same. Simple ordinary ice cream nothing much to say here.

Overall, good place but needs improvement. Should revamp the menu and improve the garnishing. Might add some basic mocktails as well.

Let's not completely spoil the name of China Town which we all Bengalis are extremely proud of. The quality of this place has deteriorated to a different extent. We ordered for a rice noodle/ mafoon and the entire thing was burnt. Despite knowing the fact that it was burnt they served it.  The gravy for most of the non veg items are mostly similar. So no more visiting this place. Extremely dissatisfied with the service.

Big Boss, as a myth goes, is one of the trios (the other two being Golden Joy and Beijing) of China Town (Tangra) which is par excellence as compared to the other restaurants of the locality. I say a myth because you would explore the same by the end of this review.¬†

So, upon entrance, we figured out that Big Boss is undoubtedly the biggest restro of China Town. There's a whirlwind car parking space like that of malls and a huge balcony outside the gate of the outlet, which is a smoker's paradise. The interior is well lit and huge, and by my estimate, it can cater at least 150 people. The chairs are comfortable and the ambiance, vibrant.

Coming to food, this is perhaps that worst Chinese food I have had in any prominent sit and dine restaurant (which is not roadside or takeaway). We have had the following :
1. Chicken Drumsticks in Schezwan Sauce - The chicken was hard and the sauce minimal. Some of the drumsticks had a weird smell too. Worst to say the least.
2. Hunan Chicken (Semi gravy) - Tasted below average. The chicken had skins all over making the gravy pathetic.
3. Schezwan Chicken (Semi Gravy) - The best of the lot.¬†
4. Mix Hakka Noodles - Was good but nothing extra-ordinary. Just like any other place is expected to serve.
5. Mix Fried Rice - The worst Fried Rice I have ever tasted. Period. The rice was over-boiled and thus was soggy. And secondly, who gives green peas in a Chinese preparation of Fried Rice ???
6. Prawn Papad - Good ! Its a bought-out item fried and served, and not a papad made in-house. :)

I have given a rating of 2.5 only for the service as it is very friendly and co-operative. The smile on the face of service staffs amidst a good crowd is always a treasure for any restaurant. All in all, if the name of China Town entices you, I would suggest you to refrain from this place for its incorrigible food. However, if you are up for drinks as the prime objective, Big Boss serves your purpose.

This restaurant being in heart of China town in kolkata has its advantages of having multi storeyed parking lot.it loos like a five star quality restaurant from outside. It's bit congested inside but they manage to cater a huge amount of people everyday due to their round tables.the ambience is perfect for joint family dinners or friends get together. As u can eat a lot and feed ppl without affecting wallet .its right place for fine dining with a big groups .its easy to travel to this place without worrying abt parking etc.

Serves good chinese, not the best but good.Went out with friends nd the first thing we noticed that each and every item was reasonably priced nd wouldn't burn a hole in ur pocket that's for sure.If i have to compare it to 'Beijing', it's still lagging behind in the service department.However we were more than satisfied by the food quality nd the quantity as well.

P.S : Alcoholic drinks r really very reasonably priced...so don't hesitateüò¨

Have always heard about Tangra and more so Big Boss. The place is such a crowdpuller.Shortly, after shifting to Kolkata, we four(me,hubby,sis in law and bro in law), checked into this restro. The dining area is that huge and buzzing with people across all age groups. The restro's ambience felt good atleast to me. People were joyously enjoying their drinks over food. We ordered prawn chips,chicken drums of heaven and chilli chicken aa starters. All tasted fine. For main course we had, cantonese style mixed gravy chowmein and chilli mushroom. The gravy chowmein tasted yumm to me. Bu, the point which snatches away the goodness would be the not so courteous and unattentive staff.That nominal main course orders took almost an hour to reach our table. Big boss has a vibe to it and I personally liked it only it could better its service quotient.

This restaurant has got a huge space which is the only plus point I found about this restaurant... Coming to food it was too ordinary... The taste of the food was not up to the mark... Service was very poor..... The waiters were serving food on our body as we felt.. If one is searching for authentic Chinese cuisine and fine dining experience this is not the place to be at... Ambience was nothing to boast about... It felt as if we were sitting amidst a market.. It's good for drinking purpose only.

I would give this restaurant a moderate feedback.
Been there few times. I liked the starters but somehow I did not like the main course dishes.
Except that it ¬†scores in the area of sitting and parking too.

One of the major crowd pullers in the Tangra area, this restaurant has undergone a number of changes over the years, some good and some not so good. They have a sprawling dine in area and a huge valet parking... that has been a good development over the years. The decor of the restaurant is appeasing. The food has always been an attraction here but it is this aspect which has seen a slight decline with time. Quantity is very good but the quality has gone down a wee bit. Will not comment much about the service... it is just as it always was... sometimes good sometimes indifferent. Well most of the restaurants in Tangra cannot boast of great service and most do not even make an effort to improve upon it. Another major attraction of this place is the cheap alcohol they serve and in today's age it makes a lot of difference in the billing, especially for those who want to enjoy the wine along with the dine. Well, in this place you need ignore certain aspects if you want to enjoy your time. But do highlight them and just hope that they do not ignore you and correct their inadequacies.

Disappointed to the core. We  ordered Dragon chicken ,Pepper chilli chicken, fish finger, crispy fried baby corn, thai chicken fried for the starters. Needless to say all the starter items was just about average. Thai fried chicken was nothing short of chicken pakora , the chicken inside was chewy sans any sauce , flavor. The chicken didn't appear fresh. It wasn't juicy and succulent which is expected. The masala cola was diluted beyond proportion. Coming to main course egg fried rice , mixed chowmein ,hot garlic fish and Hunan chicken was ordered. The taste didn't leave a mark. Egg could hardly be found in the rice. Hunan chicken was so so and fish about average. For dessert we ordered 2 darshans. It came as a bowl of fried noodle strips with 2 small ice cream scoops. The amount of fries and the ice cream was just disproportionate. Overall not a satisfying experience.

Not so much good food quality irrespect of money. We went for lunch with family, we orderded smirnoff and bp reserve. They did not fill the chart also, and in starters we ordered dragon chicken which is so so and chilly garlic fish(half). The starters are not up to the mark. And in main course we ordered kung pao chicken dry, chicken scehzwan fried rice, mixed rice noodles and hoisen chicken. Rice noodles is not up to the mark. But quantity wise i can say its huge. Altogether avarage rating.

This place is good.I mean not the best in topsia area.Not the best of China Town,but maybe the most Popular one.
Huge parking space,huge.so is the dine in space.
A multi storied bar cum restro.
Ambience is good.So is the service.
Now the main part,FOOD.
Quantity wise they are way ahead.its huge.i can guarantee that.
But somehow not the best quality chinese.Starters are good.but not the gravy items.
This is my personal feeling,based on 6 visits for the last 4years.Others may vary.

like all tengra resturants reaching the place is tough. with the availablity of ola and uber its easy now but they are hardly available at night so its better to use private car and the restaurant does have a huge parking lot . The restaurant is alsoo big with a section for private events also. but the building adjacent to the parking lot is always crowded so if you want to avoid that one must sit in the old building.Coming to the food i personally dont like the soups served here as i prefer Beijing for that .However  i love the other authentic Chinese cuisine served here specially the Cantonese,drumsticks, oyester chicken and any Chinese food under the sun.

With not of much difficulty, got a table in this resturant for six on a Saturday night. The starters were amazing we ordered some  chilli garlic shrimps ,chilli garlic chicken, threaded chicken , chilli panner . But the main course was quite disappointing the chicken noodles , chicken fried rice, chopsey was average and oyster chicken was below average. The ambience was good enough for group of friends to chill and spend some good time. Overall the night was not ruined, worth the money we spent to an extent , Could have been better if they had not compromised on main course just because it was last order.

I went there sometime ago as part of a large friends' group. The ambience was typically like any Chinese restaurant, with emphasis on the colour red.....from the current snaps in the album, I find that it has subsequently gone for a revamp.  For starters, we ordered fish fingers...they were a huge hit with the kiddo in our group. The main course items were good enough, though the noodles served were not of the thin but thick variety....something I personally find difficult to tackle. As such, I had to go for Meinfoon (rice noodles) which was quite tasty.

The Tangra, or the China Town of Kolkata has the best of Kolkata Chinese. It houses so many restaurants and eating houses serving mouth watering delicacies. Big Boss is definitely one of them. 
I had come here yesterday with my family for a dinner. The place is really big. Restaurant being located on the first floor, we were settled at a big sitting arrangement of fifteen people. The restaurant is spacious, well lit and hosts guests coming with friend groups, business profiles to families as well. 
We had ordered - 
Appetisers -
Drums of Heaven - Juicy, yummy and delicious chicken lollipops.
Golden Fried Prawns - Calcutta version of the Japanese Tempura. Loved it absolutely! 
Crispy Fried Fish - Bhetki Fillet inside, coated with a moderate biscuit crumb. Recommended!
Only tomato ketchup was served with all of these appetisers. Would suggest if there was a variety in the sauces and dips.
Main Course - 
Prawn Meefoon 
Prawn Fried Rice
Mixed Hakka Noodles 
Mixed Fried Rice 
All of them were pretty good. Loved the Mixed Fried Rice specially. 
Honey Chicken - Expected it to be the typical China Town Honey Chicken made in Honey Sauce, but it wasn't the one. Didn't live upto my expectations but it wasn't bad though. 
Fish Manchurian - Tasted pretty good but left a slightly weird smell at the end. 
Sweet Lime Soda - Fizziness wasn't there much. But the balance of sweetness was perfect. 
Overall experience was good. There are scopes of betterment. Service was good. Portions are huge. Apart from a few glitches which can be rectified, I would definitely recommend this place to have an idea about the Kolkata Chinese food.

It was my second visit and to be frank enough it was a pathetic experience.
We went on a week day and it was  crowded with over drunk people and too noisy !!
Foods we ordered :
1. Drums of heaven ( never had something more pathetic than this before, the sauce was totally burnt )
2. Dragon chicken (it was too oily)
 After this awful experience of starter we did not have the guts to order the main course. So we left the place.
The service is also bad. The waiter saw us entering but they did not bother to serve water, indeed ! they did not show gestures.
Worse experience ever !!

Visited This Place On A Friends recommendation , saw that its listed as popular for great chinese in Kolkata in Zomato too , so we decided to give it a go , well its huge Restaurant with Huge Area .. i was like wow !!! But But But lets come to the main points apart from the show bizz !! 
* ordered Dragon Chicken and Drums Of Heaven Tossed In Shezwan Sauce ,
1. DRAGON CHICKEN - the much recommended as i saw in zomato tasted okayish .. its nathing but Chickens Tossed In Chilli Garlic Sauce with few Cashew ! The thing which was most disappointing was so much Oil in a starter as if we were having Chicken Chaap and Not Dragon Chicken !!! [ 2/5 ]
2. Drums Of Heaven - 1stly Drums of heaven is meant to be tossed in a sauce but they dont toss it unless you say them to.. so we asked them to toss it in shezwan sauce and my goodness ! What a disastrous preparation.. as you guys can see in the pic , the consistency of the sauce was too poor and it didnt at all tasted like shezwan , 2ndly it was only garlic ginger and full of onion only no sauce ! That also burnt onions as you can see in the pic.. so very disappointed dish , never order this one from here.. [ 1/5 ]
3. we thought of ordering mains but we were so disappointed with the starters that we didnt have the guts to go ahead with the mains ! And the Ambience was horrible as well ! People drunk every where and shouting at the top of their Voice and Banging the tables and what not ! Really cheap place with cheap crowd ! But yeah recommended to people who wants to do hangama after drinking ! 
** Not A Recommended Place At All ! Their Chef Doesnt know the basics of chinese too and i wonder how its one of the best Chinese Restaurant in Kolkata!
Yeah Visit Only If You Want Cheap Booze ! Its really cheap at this place ! A proper daaru ka thek with some cheap Chinese food !

Went there to have lunch today . We first ordered for alcohol and starters   . And the food is pathetic . Alcohol is very cheap i guess thats the only reason people comes here . We ordered for starters and they were so so so pathetic so we left after finishing the starters . We ordered for dragon chicken  (which was super oily and tasted  like hot garlic chicken) and drums of heaven (which was chicken lolipop just like fried chicken very dry so we told them to   Toss in some sauce and it was szechwan sauce  but dint taste like szechwan . It was awful nd pathetic . ) never coming back here again .  Also not recommending this place to anyone  bcoz its pretty loud . We left this place after finishing the starters and went to flavours of china to have the main course .

Overhyped, like every other Chinese restaurant in Tyangra.
Not enough staff to manage the place properly given the size/capacity of the place, which explains the not so courteous responses from them because they are in a hurry all the time.
WE WERE A GROUP OF 11 GUYS AND THEY TOOK A HALF HOUR TO GET THE MENU AND WATER, that too, after us asking for it.
Coming to food,
Crispy baby corn had no taste at all, had to use ketchup to add some flavour.
Chicken sticks and dragon chicken were fine, in fact, pretty good.
Fried rice from the main course had peas in it. (Idk why)
Thai chicken and Garlic Chicken were fine.
And yes, PEANUTS ARE CHARGEABLE WITH DRINKS.

As the name suggests the place is spacious, really "big" in size and by 2pm it was almost full. Food quantity is generous. 1 big bowl sweet corn soup was good for 5 of us. 1 plate Cantonese noodles is also good for 2 people if not ordered with any other main course. We were 5 and ordered 1 Cantonese noodles, 1 shrimp fried rice along with 1 chicken with mushroom & baby corn on side. In drink fresh lime soda. It was more than sufficient I must say. Tastewise Cantonese noodles and fried rice was good. Chicken side was okayish, I got a weird taste in mushrooms used in the dish which I didn't like. Service is slow. Overall a decent and pocket friendly place where one will enjoy good Chinese food.

Located in the proper china town of Tangra this restaurant perhaps provide you the largest accomodation and huge parking space.
They prepare very nice chinese foods. We ordered few signature dishes of them like Dragon fish, golden fried prawn, thai style crispy fried chicken in starters. Each of them were equally tasty and u can have full plate consisting of 12pieces of fish or chicken according to your group.
In Mains we ordered hakka noodles schezwan chicken garlic chicken etc. But my suggestion would be spend a lot of time wid friends enjoying varieties of starters with drinks and u can enjoy a nice evening.

This place is huge! Nicely decorated and very well maintained. A really nice place to dine in with your family. The parking area is great. Also there is a separate smoking area. You can come in large groups and enjoy your evening over drinks and food. The food is good and the price isn't that much on the higher side considering the stature of the restora. One request is to increase the number of staff. Also not all them are well behaved. 
Apart from this, overall quite a good experience.

Though I have been to Big Boss many a time with my friends, today was the first time I went there with my family. There is enough parking space. There are two buildings in the same compound.. the old one inside and a new one just on the right hand side after you enter the gate. There is always a rush for dinner. So be ready to wait if required. Also, because of this, the waiters are always busy and you need to call them everytime you need something - ordering food, requesting for serving the food, billing, etc. The starters are good - we tried crispy baby corn and dragon chicken. Half a plate has 6 pieces of chicken, full plate has 12. There are no mocktails‚Äã - so that's a negative. But fresh lime soda, cold drinks are available along with the drinks menu. For main course, we tried chicken Hakka noodles and that was fantastic. A bowl of noodles was sufficient for two adults and a kid. We also ordered chilly chicken and Hunan chicken - both half plates. Both of them had sufficient gravy and were nicely made. Howver, the flip side is that there isn't any good dessert other than icecream.I think their noodles was the best. I can say this is the best place in China town based on quality of food and taste. The waiter also helped me in choosing the dishes. The portions are quite good. So don't order if you have any doubts about how much you can really have. The service is very fast. So even if you place an order while eating, they will serve it before you finished the items in your first order.
Overall very happy with this place. Worth going there... anytime..

An old time popular Chinese place deep inside the by-lanes of Kolkata's Tangra district. Reminded me of how all family restaurants function in China - large, bustling, loud, quick, spicy, half plates available, tasty & truly fulfilling. Though we didn't have a drink, two of us were made to sit in the Men's section... which is actually a nice idea where the kids & family enjoy majority of the space outside, without having to deal with half drunk & seriously loud after office goers. The waiter knew all the favourites, kind of recognised that we were not from the area & advised us very confidently on all the must haves.

Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Of the many times I visited this place I think I've made it to the main course only once. The starters are just so good!!
However the last visit was very forgettable. The service is worse than pathetic. With waiters out of organisation. We had to wait 10 mins for a glass of water and another 10 for someone to come take the order. Imagine how long the food took to come! The place is one the vintage favorites and sort of a brand but I'd really like the management to look into the organisation and step up the service!

When you are running low on buget amd want to have good chinese food then this is the place to visit. The food was really tasty and more than sufficient in quantity. The service was also prompt. The only reason for decreasing the rating by 0.5 is beacuse the schezwan noodles was oily than usual.

We went there few days back, and we generally love to go big boss only because big boss always offer us lovely dishes and good services. But when we visit last time we face some irritating behaviour of there weater , we always gives them tips as per our ability. That day also we give them as per our ability. But weater who serve us demanding more tips for there service. And said what ever amount we give them was not sufficient. I have nothing personal problem with them. But I want to raise this issue to the management so that next time no one have to face the same. And we visited on. 20 April 2017

Quite likely an impressive oriental setting, with a large dining space holding up its age old charisma of much famous china town. Coming to food frankly I didn't find something extraordinary but undoubtedly the quality and quantity both satisfy the expectations. Prices are moderate. Canton style gravy chowmein and chilli garlic pepper chicken is totally worth your every penny and the rest would not much let you down.

Avoid this restaurant by all means if you are coming to tangra. Went here twice got disappointed twice. My first visit was during Durga Puja 2016, as there was a rush during that time I considered that the reason for the food quality being so bad. I gave it a second try. The quality of food, presentation was equally bad if not more. Food looked like it was stale and was justed heated and served. Which restaurant serves starters and main course together if not asked for? I don't think any other restaurants does except this one!! Overall a terrible experience!!

It's bar is also available..
My favorites are shrimp, dragon chicken, chili pepper chicken and it's better try out noodles instead of rice.
Parking avabe..smoking area also available.

The worst restaurant in china town.At first when we entered everyone noticed us but no one asked us to have a seat. They didn't even ask for water. After that we waited for 15 mins then one of the staffs provide us the menu card. Quality of food was very disappointing. Very non-hygienic because we found 3-4 small hair in the food and we also informed that to the staffs. Not an expensive restaurant. But never ever going to visit again.

Food :

Prawn Chips - Good stuff - crispy fried - Prawn flavour all over 4/5

Crispy shredded Chicken - Very nicely prepared - Liked the crispness yet so soft 4/5

Chicken Fried Wanton - This was average - usual fried wanton 

Malaysian Fish - This was the star of the evening - Really well prepared - good quantity off quality fish used - stuffing adequate with very fine layering 4.5/5

Overall - Good quality and quantity - great experience 4/5

Good value for money. Food tastes good to great. We tried clear chicken soup (great), lemon chicken (average), prawn sweet and sour (great sauce) and Cantonese noodles (average).

Service was below average, but I guess that is in line with the pricing and the way they want to target market. Ambience is more like a very high end canteen than an average restaurant.

Place to go if your selection criteria is ONLY food quality at below market rate price. Food taste definitely calls for revisit.

One of the old restaurants in China Town comprising of a huge area including parking and a vast dining space. Well, we (6) got a seat as soon as we entered and made us comfortable. The waiters did not serve us water within the first 15 mins of our visit and we had to ask 2-3 times for another menu card. Nevertheless, the starters seemed to be quite amazing and the quantity was great in terms of price. The Fried Prawn, Dragon Chicken, Crispy Chicken was good and left us wanting for more. We took Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Meifoon, Garlic Fish, Honey Chicken in the main course which turned out to be okayish. The service is very poor. Though the decor is nice inside and the tables are clean always, the staffs are non cooperating. You have to call them for water, extra spoon umpteenth number of times till they respond. Really disappointed with this. 
Inspite of that, the quality and quantity of the food is okayish and not that good enough as compared to other Chinese Restaurants as observed by me. The Garlic Fish they served turned out to be a bit smelly. We had to wait 15 mins for the bill to arrive. Staff co-ordination and management is such a mess. Therefore a 3 star. 
Overall, a satisfactory experience.

Went to give my birthday treat here! First, the restaurant is very spacious and I liked the decor! We ordered red pepper chicken and Manchurian mushrooms for starter and chicken hakka noodles and chicken in oyster sauce. All of these dishes were yummm. The thing I loved about the food is that every dish tasted different and were pleasing to the taste buds. Must visit if you are looking for authentic Chinese dishes. My friends were more that satisfied with the food. Will surely visit again. The only drawback of the place is the waiters are not at all well trained and they throw a lot of attitude which I failed to understand from where they got that. All of us felt this.

After hearing so much about this place, we thought of going there for lunch. Ordered prawn for starters and mixed noodles with honey chicken for main course. Neither the prawn nor the noodles was really outstanding. Rather I found the food pretty flat. But that honey chicken desevers a special mention. What we got on the table was anything but we had expected. You can say it's more like those 'begunis' which are all about the coating. So if you dip a beguni with chicken inside instead of eggplant in honey and sprinkle sesame seeds, you will get honey chicken of Big Boss. I'd say it's a much-hyped place. Not worth the money at all. 2.5 and not 3 just for that horrible honey chicken.

For main we had chicken hakka noodles and shanghai chicken. Loved the shanghai chicken. Perfect blend of light and spicy. For dessert we had honey noodles with icecream which was a 1st for us. Loved it. All in all a great experience of chinese food at very reasonable prices.

Pathetic Bad Service these days. No quality in food. After expansion it's surprising how bad the standard has dipped to....most surprising is there is no manager in the floor to take note of such pathetic service and poor food quality.

Big boss lost its point due to its horrible service, One of the worst I have seen. On any day, whether iys a weekday or its a weekend, its service is always slow as there are never enough number of waiters/butlers. And then the behaviour of the man taking orders is not upto the mark. I am terribly disappointed!!!

Visited Big Boss, a very popular restaurant of China Town today but I am very sorry to say their Reputation graph is sliding downwards every day. We ordered Pepper Fish Fry as a starter. The starter was just awful in taste and it costed us Rs. 275. A total waste of money I would say. The worst part came later when we got a Metal Pin (Yes, a Metal Pin) in Prawn Meifoon. On complaining, the Staff and waiters were too reluctant to listen to us. None of them offered to serve the food even. They were making Lame excuses for the Metal pin being found in the Food.The Food quality was also on the average side. Overall, Big Boss has passed its prime and it is only running on its old reputation. I would suggest to everyone please save your funds and go somewhere else which will give you a value for money.

Definitely a huge competitor for Beijing in China Town because of the great quality food Big Boss has to offer. Their prawns would melt in your mouth and their rice preparations would want to make you keep coming back to them. However, that their food is quite amazing, that's a given, but one thing what Big boss offers and other restaurants in China Town fails to offer is the magnanimous space. Big boss is extremely spacious with proper parking space and provides a complete family friendly atmosphere. If you are in China Town, Big Boss is always a good decision and most surprisingly reasonable.

Being one of the most famous restaurants of Kolkata, we decided to give this place a visit on Saraswati Pujo. Due to lack of staff, they couldn't open up their eating space downstairs which they do when the amount of heads exceed their capacity upstairs. So we had to wait for 15-20 minutes before we got a seat. The place is has a good shade of lights and a nice decor. We had Dragon Chicken for starters, Egg Hakka Noodles and Chicken with Baby corn and Mushroom for main course. The Dragon Chicken was incredibly delicious, the noodles was okay but the Chicken Main Course could've been a tad better. Their serving and hospitality services was not up to the mark as we were made to wait 30 minutes before they handed us a menu and a glass of water which is simply unacceptable from a restaurant of such repute.

Seems a popular Chinese eatery going by the crowd. Food is just about average. We ordered chicken manchow soup which is nowhere near the authentic flavour, sweet corn soup was okay. Mixed gravy noodles was the only decent item. Chilli chicken was the weirdest of the lot, it was basically Manchurian chicken with a few green chillies thrown in. When I asked the waiter he nonchalantly replied that there are no chillies in Manchurian, hence this is Chilli chicken. I don't know where this worthless recipe originated from. Now coming to staff behaviour - this is the worst point. About 5 minutes after placing the initial order, I thought of adding a plate of fried baby corn, to which the waiter's reply was - "the order you've placed is okay, you don't need to add anything". Just imagine the audacity!!! I will have to adjust to his orders. I was very unhappy with this behaviour, as a result I paid by card and deliberately left no tips for the waiter to which this guy said - why haven't you left anything for me ? 
This is perhaps the weirdest staff behaviour I've faced till date.

One of the most popular, cost effective and better food joints of Kolkata, when it comes to chinese food. Actually its in Tangra, the China town of kolkata. You can see many others Chinese restaurant in that particular place but this one is the best according to me because it has its own parking place and the ambiance is really good. The quality of food is very good and is reasonable as well.

Among other restaurants in Tangra, Big Boss is a so so restaurant with good ambiance and spacious enough. But when it comes to food taste, its my personal opinion that it is far better in Golden Joy or China Garden, Kim ling, e.t.c. Quantity is good and that is the reason it seems reasonable. Staffs are well behaved. Overall good experience

I was unwell and requested the Manager to deliver soup and momos to my place a few meters away. Even after I expressed my inability to travel due to weakness, the rude Manager declined service, had the nerve to demand a reservation, and hung-up when I refused.

Proper hygiene is maintained. staff is very cooperative. Quantity and quality both are perfect.

Hyped restaurant at China Town, tangra. Very average ambience and services. Food quality is pathetic. Though pork item is not spotted in menu but on asking they provided it. The chilly pork full of oil looked bad and tasted worst, we could not even gulp it fully. Other fish and chicken items were equally bad and tasted just like any item of street side stalls. With such a price tag, this degrading quality of food can really make any one disappointed. The money was totally wasted at this place. Not at all recommended for fellow foodies.

Why should -¬†
1. Good food.
2. Good crowd.
3. Nice ambiance
4. Clean toilets.

Why shouldn't -¬†

However, one thing i did not like about this place is the service. After ordering the food there was a long waiting time. The service was not very prompt. I have been to Big boss couple of months before and it was the same experience then as well.. Otherwise over all the place is satisfactory.

The tangra China Town area in Calcutta is dotted with over 200 restaurants of all sizes.....and even then Big Boss has its own identity. The two best things with Big Boss for me primarily are- it has its own parking space with a lot of room; and secondly the amazing ambience.

The food though is just like most other restaurants in the area.... nothing really special barring the starters and drinks. I've been there numerous times when I used to live in Calcutta and still would love to go there the next time I'm in Calcutta.

If you're planning to go there in a group of more than 4, reach early because it's an amazing joint to hang out and they are full almost all the time. Bigger tables with large groups take more than a couple of hours to vacate.

While you're there, try the dragon chicken / prawn and the ever popular "drums of heaven".

This is the place I always visit when we decide for a trip to China Town. Apart from great starters and soups, I like this place because of its the nice parking facility, this makes my life easy. There are many good restaurants in China Town, but Big Boss beats them when it comes to soups. My wife and I mostly have a large bowl of soup accompanied by a starter and that's it for us. The staff find it odd that we order a large bowl for just the two of us -- but hey, that's the way we like it. But don't get me wrong. The main course of this place is fantastic too. Try out the Hot Garlic Chicken and mixed Hakka noodles. Have been to this place more than 10 times I guess.

We visited this place on the first year of our college just after passing +2... A group of 16 friends came here... We didn't expect they can give us space for such a huge group... But  surprisingly we didn't even have to wait a little... We got accommodated easily and also together... I shared an American chopsuoy with my friend and myself ordered Chinese chopsuoy... Both were mixed ones having chicken prawn pork etc... In side dish we took dry chilly chicken and lemon chicken... I must say the American chopsuoy and the lemon chicken were best in its class... We ordered Tuborg Strong beer... It was quite affordable for a price of 170 per bottle as that time... The service was very good by the waiters... They even served us with the dishes difficult to serve... We enjoyed a lot.

Big Boss is a name I always associate with the legendary Kung Fu king .... this place is not legendary but does have its plus points.

It is for starters huge and has ample parking. Food is reasonably priced and portions are generous. The food in general is nothing to write home about but hey its ok slightly above average.

The service is mediocre at best and the service staff are at the best of times partially interested. Please note that if you have an hour for lunch please reserve a third of the time for ordering and thereafter reminding them bill please. I have never gotten my bill there in one go ( that goes for food, beer, fork, serviette etc) ... well atleast they are consistent.

Why do I keep going back casue I have some incredibly fond memories of time spent there during my student days when we would split a beer and fried rice and sweet and sour chicken üôÑ.

Overall not the King of Tangra Restaurants but dedinately a minor sidekick( me ponders if Robin ever had an assistant).

This is my first visit to China Town in Kolkata and my hopes were very high. 
Friends took me to this restaurant. This is a bar cum restaurant which of course is done up in Chinese style and is spacious. Seating is quite comfortable and one can go with family.
We ordered the chicken chilly garlic pepper and the dragon prawn. The chicken was tasty but was a bit too dry for my liking. The dragon prawn was tasty but I didn't know Chinese use whole cashews in the gravy!!!! ( or is it to suit Indian taste?).
For the main course it was the mixed fried rice, schezwan chicken and lemon fish . The noodles and the chicken was alright but the lemon fish gravy was too sweet for my liking. 
Overall a joint that serves just about average Chinese food . I've had far far better in the same city.

Big BOSS as suggested by my friends was the most posh restaurant in China town with great infrastructure and all attracted me. So yeah i turned up one day with three more friends of mine. Yes the infrastructure as said earlier was quite good as compared to other restaurants in that zone along with that a big parking space.But coming to food quality and services was not at all upto the mark. Food quality was average along with very bad service. The water for our table was perhaps a new one and did know about half of the food items along with that a very bad temper. In one word my experience was awful!

I with my family went their for lunch on a holiday. Ambience wise it is good with lot of sitting capacity. They have a huge parking capacity so you can take your car without hesitation. Now coming to the food, I must say it is disappointing. We ordered golden fried prawn which was good but not the best. Chicken sweet corn soup was good. Main disappoinment was with the main course. Mixed fried rice was below average. Singapore fish was also average. We were saved by Mixed Meifoon & Shanghai fish. In a whole a average place with false hype

Had chicken hakka noodles and hunan chicken with beers
It has a huge parking space with huge space in Restaurent 
Food quality is not up to the mark
Noodles tasted saltless and chicken tasted simple 
The waiters asked for tips and after giving some the next waiter came and asked for some more
The bike parking man forcibly asked tips

Suggested for people having four wheelers

We a team of 6 went for dinner to this apparent famous restaurant. Luxurious parking space having 2 levels of parking as well as ample seating almost like 20-30 tables at a time. So thats an advantage over most restaurants in city with no waiting period. The menu has all sorts of options of chinese with half and full quantity. We ordered full plate of crispy chicken cutlets for starters, followed by mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noddles, mixed american chopseuy, schezwan prawn gravy and chicken in chilly oyster sauce. Chicken cutlet ws hot n crispy, noddles was dry n lacked flavour, schezwan prawns werent anywhere near spicy, chicken in oyster sauce sadly had a lot of salt in it and american chopseuy was a tad sweeter than usual. Portions were ok but waiters due to rush werent serving us and had to be repeatedly called to serve us each dish. As it ws a bit too crowded and almost like fish market, was not a great dining experience.

Always have a good time here whenever I visit..huge parking space and equally spacious dining area with separate family section,this is arguably one the best restaurants in China Town.the prices are reasonable.some food items are really heavenly like the gold coin prawns,golden fried prawns and dragon chicken but at times they are inconsistent and don't maintain the same quality.. plus they don't have cocktails in their drinks menu.. the service can be slow if u are unlucky,it needs to improve..the ambience is fine,quite a good place for casual dining with friends over drinks..

The food is usually good , however sometimes it is not upto the mark.
Once in 2014 we had tried the Chicken Meinfoon and loved it .
However , we again tried the same dish in April and the quality was disastrously bad.

went there with my friends on a random winter day last year, First thing that you notice is a grand spacious entrance with a parking space so naturally your mind eases a lot and that relaxing vibe sets in. Since the locality is famous for Chinese food so we went with the flow and ordered couple of dishes like chicken soup, chicken noodles and another chicken curry that had way too excess oil in it, but overall the taste of food was quite underwhelming , I mean the grandeur of the place compels you to think that taste would completely blow you away but that didn't happen. May be I kept my expectation too high. And we also had lot of booze which were decently priced and some pineapple¬† mocktails (I am not really into alcoholic drinks). But an extra half rating solely for the ambience Its worth visiting!

A nice place for Chinese food.  Good and tasty food and the huge area reduces the waiting time that one usually faces at China Town.  The staffs are nice but the ambience is not that good as due to a large number of guests there is a lot noise
Coming to food.. The food is really good and affordable and tasty as well. The half plate system also allows you to try a lot of dishes. 
A good place to go to when you are low on budget but want a lot of variety.

We went to Big Boss on the day of Mahalaya for lunch. We were a group of over 30 people so we had to pre-book a table beforehand. Let me say, the restaurant is quite spacious! It seemed as if we are at Hogwarts because we were seated on both sides of a very long table. And it has huge space for parking. We had Chicken Noodles, Chicken Fried rice, Chicken Manchurian and Garlic Chicken. Don't know about the veg gang. The food was good. Not expensive at all. Fits well in the budget. The ambience is nice too. Gives a nice feeling with the chinese lanterns hanging. What was disappointing was the speed of service. The service was too slow. We had to wait for ages to get served.

The only thing in big boss is a large parking area.Excluding that, specially for food taste..below average..food quantity very less than others...service is also not up to the mark indeed. Specially on any occasion day like puja etc they have very specific numbers of item which are as like as same...
Above all as per the service man, Big Boss does not bother about all those negative points while we are discussing and informed them...
Strongly not recommended that place if you are a family person or looking for group party.

Had a very bad experience with food quality, service & behaviour of staff on 16th Oct 16, ¬†Sunday. Had gone with family for dinner. A normal Thai soup took more than 45 minutes for delivery at 6.30pm, at a time when the restaurant was hardly filled. Later the behavior of the floor staff, especially one guy called Robert(though am not sure of the name) was very rude. There was also no senior supervision, whereas the restaurant as later teeming with customers. Food quality was also quite poor. The coatings of the fried prawn was abysmal. Indeed why Beijing still remains Beijing! Not going back in a hurry!¬†

Big Boss...you are not big & definitely not the boss...are you listening???

The quintessential Indo Chinese or Tangra cuisine eatery of Calcutta. Every food loving bong from Calcutta swears by it.Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the Tangra Chinese people and the Tangra cuisine of Calcutta here is some food for thought at the cost of digressing from the main topic;

Tangra is a region in east Kolkata that traditionally housed a large number of tanneries owned by people of Hakka Chinese origin. "47 South Tangra Road", may be the most confusing postal address, as it used to cover the whole of Chinatown Tangra with over 350 tanneries. Over the past several decades, it has served as the location of Calcutta's Chinatown. 

Food from Tangra is a distinct variety of traditional Hakka Chinese cuisine adapted to Indian ingredients and the Bengali palate. This has spread to the rest of India, along with the recipes earlier unique to Tangra. Tangra is now the most popular destination for Chinese food. Chinese food sold in Tangra restaurants are now known all over the world as 'Hakka Style" Chinese food or colloquially Indo Chinese cuisine.

Probably named after Bruce Lee's Movie 'the Big Boss' the restaurant is iconic , phenomenally large and can seat hundreds. 

Dragon chicken is the flagship dish of this restaurant. Pocket pinch would be to the tune of approx 1100 rupees for a couple without beverages.

We visited the restaurant during Durga Puja on Dashami. The food was awful. The mixed chowmien¬†was ¬†just boiled noodles with no taste and very sparse amount of vegetable and ingredients. There was hair on the sauce bowl. When we complained to the manager, he said: "It is because of the pujos. The quality will get better after the puja". What kind of restaurant operates like this? Sorry, highly not recommended and will vote with my money... never going back.

On complaining them they refused to serve us the 12th one.so inspite of ordering a full plate we had to satisfy ourselves in less than that.Service was poor.They themselves were too busy talking to themselves that they failed to attend customers when they needed.We had to wait for long for getting few tissues too.They were kind of reluctant.The starter was okayish,as ordered it was supposed to be crispy but it wasnt served so to us.On asking for finger bowl they refused that too.I wonder which restaurant doesnt offer so!!

I have been to Big Boss all total 4 times. After trying few other restros over there in china town, I found it best among them. But in last 2 visits I found the ambiance has deteriorated. Previously it was a nice place to have delicious food peacefully with privacy. But now I can found people shouting at the top of there voice after having few pegs of drinks which hampers/disturbs the over all atmosphere. We can hardly listen and can continue our chit chats.. Any way coming to the point of foods we ordered 2 starters (can't remember the names) one with 8 chicken pieces that was really great but another one crispy chicken which was shredded was not that tasty as they has over fried it. In the main course, there we had chicken fried rice and hunan chicken and sanghai chicken. there was need of little bit more ¬†salt in the rice and apart from that the food was okay (I had sanghai chicken much more tasty in few other restaurants like banzara at jadavpur 8b)Neway hope you will focus more on maintaining the ambiance and food quality.

The only good thing about this place is that there is a designated parking lot.

Cons - Ordinary food at market rates but with ample quantity. During peak hours, there will be 1000s of people dining together making it difficult to converse. Good for team lunch/dinners. Not good as a family restaurant.

This is my first time in China town. Big boss is one of the most renowned restaurant in China town. First of all its a huge restaurant. I was completely astonished by seeing the parking lot. It's just like a mall's parking lot. No issues in parking. Now come to the main part i.e. about the restaurant. Decoration  is above average. It's a bar cum restaurant. It was a Saturday night so there was a lot of crowd and a bit noisy. Almost full house. We oredered
1. fried Thai chicken - it was good but sometimes it was bit chewy. 
2. Crispy chicken stick (shredded) - it's not upto the mark. If it's not hot then you will feel it a bit hard.
3.crispy fried fish - it's awsome. The quality of fish is also good.
4. Chilly garlic pepper fish - it's also the same as above fish item.
5. Fried prawn balls - could have been better.
6.mixed fried rice - it's just awsome. I have visited couple of good Chinese restaurants in town but I have never eaten such a good fried rice. It's 5 out of 5.
7.mix gravy noodles(pan fried) - I ordered a pan fried gravy noodles but the dishes I was served its a normal gravy noodles not a pan fried one. The taste was average.
8. Chilly chicken - it's a traditional Chinese dish.. and it was superb.
9. Fish with vegetables - it was horrible. Tasteless dish. The taste of some of the pieces of fish was not good.
In a dessert we ordered butterscotch ice creme. It was two scoop of that ice creme. Fresh lime soda was good. Masala cold drinks was not good, if lemon is added then it was drinkable. 
Overall it is an average restaurant with a lots of crowd. If someone is looking for a solitary restaurant or going for a date I will not recommend this restaurant for noise. But if someone is going with friends or a gang then it's not an issue. Food quality is average except some of the dishes. Lastly  the staffs are good. But due to crowd you have to wait 15-20mins to get the food after placing order. It's quite annoying. Otherwise it's a mid range restaurant and can be visited as a budget restaurant.

This being one of the most well-known and famous restaurants of China Town, Tangra was very disappointing and not up-to the hype as per my expectations. ¬† 

The ambiance of this place is classy and sauve enough, as compared to most of the joints in this place, it has a widely varied parking area and multi-storied sitting arrangements with comfortable seating areas and separate family dining area. 

Coming to the food we ordered at this place, the prawn papad was as usual and nothing exceptional to say about. With that we ordered Chicken and Mixed Fried rice, which was very less in quantity as compared to the price and also the quality was very ordinary and average. And also there was a Prawn Fry which we ordered, as usual which was very less in quantity and extremely salty. There was a Chicken dish we ordered, the name I forgot, but it was of the Pan Fried variation and was supposed to be chilly(as requested) but it was way too much sweet, way too much which was not at all as expected. 

Overall, the service and the ambiance is good enough, but the food, both in terms of quantity and quality is not at all good enough or exceptional as per the hype of this place.

I have visited this place for so many times with my family. If it is Chinese,it is big boss for me. Well, to be honest, this is the only restaurant that I have visited in the China town. I was never a Chinese lover until I visited this place. 
The food is always great. I love their shrimp papad, garlic pepper chicken and dry chili chicken. The quantity they serve is enough and price is reasonable too. Quality is very good . And taste is just incredibly awesome.

Big boss is a multi cuisine family restaurant located in tangra. It is spread over a huge area. The interiors are quite simple but elegant. The staffs are very cordial and friendly. The food is extremely  tasty and has the authentic taste of Chinese food. This place is a complete value for money. The quantity and  quality both are amazing. The  kung pao chicken is a must try. A great place for Chinese food in tangra. A must try :)

Big boss is famous for its parking. The parking place that this restaurant is having is bigger and better than any of its competitors. I felt big boss is a nice place but the ambience I did not like as I get in Golden Joy. I am a fan of Chinese food and big boss has that taste but somehow I feel it did not connect with me as I feel I am a bit biased towards Golden Joy. You can have a great food out here and if you want ambience I feel big boss is bit behind.

The food here is similar to ne Chinese restaurant in Chinatown tangra... Nothing special but the saddest part is if u don't hav a gal with u, u'll not be considered a family man and u'll be sent to bar which very gloomy and the ambience sucks... Besides I don't drink alcohol and didn't liked this discrimination.. and don't like going to this usual bars where its very noisy can't here to each others voices and the place being comparitively dark compared to the family section didn't quite liked the atmosphere and it practically killed the mood... Though the food was good but will NEVER GO to Big boss becoz of its poor ambience in the bar... Where I was sent as I didn't hav ne gal with me.. as the food available here can be found in ne restaurant in Chinatown at a reduced price...Kushal

The place is pleasant,staff could be a bit more active.The food on the whole is average,i would not recommend the fried rice because somehow they put peas which destroys the flavor of the rice itself and has a funny smell.The schezwan noodle are recommended.Although if you want cocktails,this is not the place to be as they only serve screw drivers.On the whole one could give it a try.

The ambiance is decent... while the service is polite and prompt...
The food is not the best Chinese but it is fairly good... the Schezwan noodles were the highlight.... n the dragon chicken...
They provided only one kind of cocktail... #screwdriver... which was not on the menu...
All in all a decent place to visit....this place doesn't disappoint....

A very over hyped place.. Went there last weekend.. Was my 2nd visit this time and my experience wasn't that great.
Food was not that good and they really sucks at cocktails.. Just bloody marry and screw driver that's all they had.
As we weren't sure what to order so we asked for suggestions as wanted to try out their best options..which weren't that good.
They have same dishes with different names.
For starter we tried out pepper garlic fish  which was pretty basic and also we ordered mixed Hakka noodles and a chicken side dish.. The chicken pieces were very small like the one we get at local snacks bar.
Overall it's an okay place for small get together as its not  too expensive,but if you are looking for good Chinese food there are many other places and way better than this one...

Big Boss is a well known restaurant of Tangra. It is huge and ha mole tables and chairs to accommodate customers,but still it will be difficult to find seats here during weekend and festivals. The quality has definitely deteriorated as the restaurant has grown. The quantity of food given here is plenty and that serves well for groups who come to dine here. I had treated my friends on my birthday here last year. Had ordered crispy chilli baby corn and dragon chicken as starters. Both were marvellous in my opinion. Taken hakka noodles,fried rice, chicken meifoon,kungpao chicken,hot garlic chicken and paneer Manchurian for main course. The rice and noodles were alright. The rice noodles or meifoon was horrible to taste. Too oily and bland. the kungpao chicken was very tasty. Although the food was good,but the staff's behaviour put us off a little bit. They took forever to take our orders and asked for a greater amount of tip from us outright. I found that to be very unprofessional. Otherwise the experience was a good one.

Located at china town, this restaurant is known for its authentic chinese spreads. The restaurant is aesthetically decorated and is quite spacious. We tried
TANGY FISH- it tasted brilliant. The tanginess was enhancing. The fish wasn't deep fried but was soft and fresh, impressive to the taste buds.
MIXED RICE NOODLE- tasted okayish. 
HUNAN CHICKEN- consisted of 6 pieces of chicken and a lots of vegetables and mushrooms. Had no dominating flavour and tasted like any normal  chicken side dish. The mushrooms weren't properly cooked in the gravy.
FRUIT COCKTAIL ICECREAM- two scoops of vanilla ice cream with cherries on top served with many fruits in a glass. Not bad.
It was a mixed experience from my side. They must work harder to keep the fame of being the best chinese restaurant of china town, untarnished.

Now the food... It's really authentic Chinese good quality food... quantity is quite large and price worthy... liquors too pocket friendly... Try out meifoon here and Malaysian chicken ...it's delicious.... A wide variety of starters and main course side dishes....service prompt and generous.... In this visit only thumbsdown is for the washroom area,please keep it clean.. a rainy dinner with steamed up delicious dishes and touch of liquor  is really an experience for me.. recommended highly...

Had heard much hype about the place. Have visited most other places in China Town, but not this one. Apart from the conveniently priced liquor, I have not been a huge fan of China Town anyway. However, too a look after hearing so many good things about the place. Honestly, all expectations washed away, not at all a supreme restaurant, on the contrary we found average food ( you will find better in other Chinese joints ) which is overpriced for this standard.
The food does not taste or look good, very casually presented ¬†and cooked. Not worth paying so much. I found the staff well behaved. The ambiance and sitting arrangements were good enough. But the main part, the food was disappointing.

Big Boss restaurant is one of the many Indo-Chinese eateries along Tyangra. The fact that it serves alcohol and the spicy Chindian favourites at easy money makes it a place a lot of people visit. I donot have a particular attraction for this cuisine, but the dishes they served were aplenty in quantity and quite filling. The flavour remains not much different from the regular Chindian restaurants littering the alleys of the city, but if you want to look for a decent place to eat in the Tyangra locales, this is a good place to be.

Given the qty and location, this place is a winner.
You have a big group who are big eaters, are occasional drinkers, then this is the place to be.
You can order bottles of liquor, along with pegs.
You can order from a fairly big menu spread.
The tastes are a bit similar (well, they have only Chinese to offer) but good enough.
The quality is good.
But their usp is qty and the price.
Have been here multiple times. The space is airy and the waiters attentive enough.
A group can interact and simultaneously enjoy their time and food here, courtesy to the big space offered.
Oh, and they have large parking area.
Enjoy.

A great place to have pocket friendly drinks and irresistible Chinese cuisine.

They offer drinks by the bottle which makes it a very economic place.

In terms of food they offer both half and full variants of a dish and the portion size is huge in both cases.

I have tried their Crispy Chilli Babycorn,Drums of Heaven,Green Pepper Chicken,Golden Fried Prawns,Hot Garlic Prawn,Chilli Chicken,Hot Garlic Chicken etc and have never been disappointed.

In terms of decor it's a very average place but extremely spacious.However,it gets very crowded during the evenings and especially during weekends so much so that it becomes a daunting task to have a normal conversation across the table.

On the other hand, a big plus is the ample parking space.

It's a great place for team outings and with friends.

Waited for 50 minutes after entrees for main course and the waiter tells me that it takes time to cook food.....
really dude???? thanks for enlightening me .............i was under the impression that it comes from a bloody factory line..........
Something seriously wrong with these guys.
Went to the front desk and complained about the wait staff and guess what???? they were even worse....
So just paid for entrees and walked out...
I guess it is OK in Kolkata to treat customers like that and that's why you are surviving, but god forbid ¬†if ever there would be a restaurant like this in NCR or Mumbai... you would close down in less than a month

The most important is if you go there you can't miss prawn chips what they are famous for. It's in China town so roads aren't good apart from that it's a great place for hogging!!!!!!

The major positive side of this restaurant in the crowded Tangra area is the huge parking lot, and it also has a good seating capacity where large gatherings can be done without any prior table booking!!!

Ambience is quite nice, but the time to deliver the food takes a hell lot of time!!!! Prices are very steep at this place, now with all the VAT and s*it taxes, the bill balloons up to a huge amount considering the amount of food ordered.¬†

Currently, there was an offer on white rum - one 60ml peg free with two of the same. The starters - Drums of Heaven and Crispy Fried Chicken are pretty tasty but the normal hakka/gravy noodles are very bland in taste, good for people looking for non-spicy food options over there, but the shezwan noodles is good enough. And lamb here is not all good-to put it in a good way....

Overall: Quality has deteriorated over the years and the prices have shot up like anything...

People of Kolkata love Chinese. No wonder 'China Town' is a big hit! This restaurant is one of the many restaurants in Tangra. What you'll notice first is the huge parking area. And once you're in, it has a huge seating area as well. But then, I won't say that the ambience is great. When it is so spacious, you could do so much with the place. It's pretty regular. About the food, we ordered golden fried prawns, Chicken manchurian dry, steamed and fried momos. Did not like the momos at all. And they shouldn't even name it golden fried prawns. Chicken manchurian was fine. In the main course we ordered rice noodles, mixed fried rice, Kung pao chicken, shredded lamb. To be honest, I did not like any of them. Service was pathetic. Prices decent. With so many Chinese restaurants in the area, I am not going to go back to this one.

Seven hungry souls on a Sunday afternoon, headed for Big Boss in the hope of getting a table without a very long wait. The huge seating capacity ensured that, even though the initial impression was discouraging.

To cut to the chase, several orders of Fried Chicken Wantons, Chicken Spring Rolls and Crispy Fried Chicken went out as accompaniment for a couple of rounds of beer. The wanton could certainly have done with a more generous filling but the crispness somewhat compensated for the omission. The other two were indeed good. No complaints there, at all.

The amount of starters we had, would have sufficed as lunch on a normal day. But so ravenous were we that one plate each of Mixed Fried Rice (simply divine), Mixed Meifoon (rather stingy with the goodies, I thought) and Mixed Cantonese Chow (wonderfully made) along with a passable shredded chicken with cashew dish, the name of which I can't for the life of me remember, simply vanished into a bottomless pit. Oh, and there were two dishes of (semi dry, as ordered) Hot Garlic Prawns too, that could have done with a lot less gravy.

Lest you get me wrong, allow me to clarify that the portions were at least ample if not outright generous. Overall, the food was good and the prices, extremely reasonable.

The hour was late when our gorging came to an end. They just had two Darsaans left over. We polished them off too!

The restaurant is very spacious and well decorated but seating arrangement is not at all comfortable.Lets come to the main point which is food ofcourse...
We tried Dragon chicken and Red Pepper Chicken as starter with chilled beer.Dragon chicken was very good in taste but red pepper chicken not up to the mark.We had red pepper chicken in Golden joy nd blv me it is hell and heaven difference in taste.
Then we had Chicken fried rice and Chicken Manchurian.Chicken fried rice was good bt it was not authentic chinese to be very honest and chicken manchurian is not good..it was very bland in taste.Overall all foods were so so in taste.

Place is authentic chinese and during my last visit roped in few collegues from China and they rated it¬†very well and called it a twist of Indian in chinese. Bad part is high prices(Bills can go very high in case you are in a group of 10-15)¬†but you get full value for your money

A very famous restaurant in the very famous China Town. But sadly, its a one to disappoint. When it comes to food, there is no complaint regarding it. However, the service is appalling. I have been there thrice and all the three times I had to face a very poor customer service. They take time to serve you the orders. Sometimes they take 20-30 minutes to even take your orders. The latest instance that I had to face was when the waiter accidently destroyed one of my friend's drink. When asked to replace the drink, they took 40 minutes to give him the drink. On enquiring about the delay, we were told that this was being INVESTIGATED.. The manager, Justin clearly had no idea what the issue is and had no managerial skills to manage the issue. Overall, the service has always been very bad and I have made up my mind that it would be my last visit to Big Boss.

This place is the most popular Chinese restaurant in Tangra (China Town). It is hard to find seats in weekends, as it remains full all the time. ¬†The ambiance and the food is perfect but nothing extraordinary. Spacious and nice parking area both in ground floor and 1st floor. We ordered Prawn Chips, Golden Fried Prawns, Dragon Chicken, Mix fried rice, Kung Pao and Hunan Chicken. The service was not that fast (well you have to remind them that you have ordered something), but pocket friendly. Hope to come by sometime in the future.

Used to be one of the better restaurants in China Town. Not only this place is huge but they also maintain a decent parking space. People flock here like madmen and hence finding a place to sit can be very difficult at weekends and festivals. They were once known to serve one of the best Chinese food in this city, but sadly the quality has deteriorated. The pricing here is on the higher side, but the food still makes up for it. But just for a penny, I wouldn't like to waste some excess money here and would rather resort to some of the cheap and economical restaurants around to save some bucks.

Quite literally, this is the "Big Boss" of all the restaurants in China Town. Whenever I feel like having quality Chinese at reasonable rates, Big Boss is what comes to my mind. 

The USP of this place being the enormous but well maintained parking space. This place is always packed. Forget visiting here, during Pujas, this place is jam packed, and getting a table is equally difficult. Even during the weekends, its pretty difficult to find yourself a seat.

Food is amazing, as I said earlier, quality Chinese at reasonable rates, is what, you will get here. Portions are enormous. Entrees and mains are equally commendable.

The decor is fantastic. Well maintained. The staffs are quite corteous. Worth visiting again.

It takes a lot of effort to stay on top and be recognized as a legendary destination. For Big Boss though, both these statuses are withering. Once, China Town and Big Boss seemed synonymous, but sadly not any more. Though the restaurant has grown in size and put up a better attire, it somehow seems to have compromised on the food itself. This does not mean it tastes bad, just mellowed in comparison to its own standards.

The food does not taste and feel special any more. You will find similar servings of food at any average Chinese Restaurant now a day. Then what sets Big Boss apart? Well, to be honest, nothing.¬† It is just the past glory and decent palatable flavours, that has people returning and throwing one full house after another for the management to bank upon.

Coming from an ardent Big Boss fan, this is rather a sad review. It is expected that the management stirs up a bit and starts producing food with similar care and flavours that cheers both the guest and his tummy.

One of the best place in China town to dine. Every time I come here during the pujas and even with my friends during the entire year. The food quality is great . I am in love with the Gracie noodles, pan fried chilly fish, and the the dragon chicken. Quite a large catering area where you can take your family, friends as well as business groups and the service is also good.

Just after finishing my exam 3 of us planned to go to china town and we chose big boss for fulfilling our hunger pangs. We had ordered chili fish, prawn chips, dry chili chicken, lut me chicken, dragon chicken. And we had ordered beer, 100 pipers whiskey on repeat. Coming to food first which was the sole purpose of our visit. It was nothing close to value for money. All chicken preparations had same garnish and tasted more or less same. Fish had a kind of pungent smell, coz it was not well cooked thoroughly. Though the coating was hard. 
Service of food and drinks can be changed to self service. From restaurant manager to the waiters no one was even bothered to take order. They were busy in their own discussions. We had to call the nearby waiter 4 times, so that he can come for taking order. 
Lastly the ambience, which was getting crowded as hours passed by. Just cause of its bygone glory of past years. Walls and seats needs to be re-furnished. Our mission was completed but not value for money.

Big Boss is the most famous & common name of China Town. Probably its the biggest & most visited restaurant too.

Location : Its straight from Topsia Road into the lanes of China Town.

Decorations : Enter from the gate & you will realize their is no issue regarding car parking over here. As their parking lot divided into floors is bigger than the restaurant itself. You may need to wait to get sited as it is filled most of the time. The dining is huge & lots of tables are there. Sitings are separately divided for groups, couples & family. Dining is nicely & simply decorated. Its little cozy but the ambience is good.  Decorated roofs with warm white lightings & green aquariums are eye catching.

Staffs & Management : Many people says that they took really long to serve but its absolutely wrong. Their staffs are really good at managing crowds that you will find this place full of every time. Even when the restaurant was fully loaded their staffs took our orders & served us in little time.

Bar Experience : Ordered a bottle of Heineken, Ahh that smooth, crisp & light taste of Heineken that needs no other description. They served chilled drinks in few minutes before the food. Surprisingly they also served a plate of Bombay Mix (Chanachur) with the drink for free. Well thats a nice try to impress customers.

Dragon Chicken : There was 8 medium sized chicken pieces mixed with carrot, capsicum, onion & cashew nuts served in a bowl. Chicken pieces were extremely well cooked & they were one of the most softest & perfectly cooked chicken I have tried. It was juicy from inside & flavours came from it was impressive. The balance of spices used were excellent & in result the dish tasted really brilliant. In a single line their Dragon Chicken is the ideal "Chaat" for your favorite drink.

Fried Szechuan Chicken : It was such an idiotic decision by me of ordering this item. Going by its name I thought this spicy fried chicken would taste great with drinks but unfortunately it was completely opposite. It was just boneless chicken sticks lightly fried that was absolutely tasteless. There wasn't any flavour or richness present to enjoy. However chicken was nicely cooked. Skip this item when ordering. 

Pricing : All the dishes were priced surprisingly lower than expected. Their quality of food, dine & bar experience, ambience, service everything creates a good balance with their total bill that wouldn't hurt pocket much.

Conclusion : Big Boss is an ideal place to enjoy your favorite crisp & smooth drink with some spicy side dishes that you will love to have. Not only that, they offer such a good dine for a family dinner too. After all this they doesn't burn your pocket. Overall Big Boss is an absolute recommend if you are in China Town.

The only thing good about it is the great food. The taste is just fantastic. However, service and staff are extremely arrogant and demeaning to say the least. We reached the place at 9 pm and were told to wait as the ac was still not 'on'. After some wait we got a table. A one Mr. Anmol was waiting at our table and I must say I have never come across such an arrogant waiter. He just refused to serve us water with our drink as we had not ordered mineral water! A complain to the manager met with just lip service and I was forced to help myself for some water from their serving counters. This place is ok if you can bear with this filthy service.

Big Boss is a place we used to come frequently during college day's as then the nos of bars and pubs were much lesser and likewise any other Tangra resto they serve alcohol in bottles...
Very easy to locate and this time we went to the new construction which is attached with the parking lot...Covered with glass and quite a decent ambience compared to other's there...
Been there to celebrate a birthday...The food were-Fried Spring Chicken,Chicken Korean Sticks,Chilly Garlic Pepper Fish,Singapore Chicken,Kung Pao Chicken,Mixed Sch.Noodles with Darsan and vanilla ice-Cream...
I personally love being here because of many personal reasons and can actually re-live those happy times we used to spend during college...
See you soon...

When we used to visit "Big Boss" it was a single huge room with ample chairs and tables. We have seen the construction grow and the place grow across buildings!
Their chicken/fries are commendable and are perfect accompaniments with drinks.
Their quantity was good. Cannot comment much on the recent times since haven't been there in a long time!

Being born and brought up in Kolkata, restaurant hopping in China town is like an occasional gastronomic ritual. Big Boss is one my fav eateries because of its sensible pricing, good quality food and a lackadaisical ambience. We went for a weekday dinner and the places was buzzing with happy foodies! We ordered beer,  paneer korean stick, schezwan veg noodles, mixed fried rice and chilli fish. I have to admit that the paneer sticks stole the show. They are filling, rightly cooked, served with an array of saut√©ed vegetables like a kebab and exudes a commendable equipoise of spices. The quantity of all the items were quite robust and made for a tummyful experience. Just one gripe the place was very hot and the AC was not at the right temperature!

Heard a lot about chinatown so decided to go there. It didnt look like chinatown even a bit. Big boss is one of the many chinese restaurants in tangra. It is the largest and  the most crowded. After waiting for 1 hour we got our table. Food is okayish, not authentic chinese. But prices are reasonable. The place is so crowded, that the noises can make you go mad. Overall good.

Well, every citizen of Kolkata is well aware of what "China Town" is popular for. Among the veteran names of the area, one of the most popular is "Big Boss" , which turned out to be an out and out over hyped one!!
The positive thing about the place is that it houses a huge space, with enormous place for parking. The interior d√©cor is also quite impressive. But coming to food, it is overpriced out and out, if compared with the taste and quality. It is not that the food is bad, but not at all justified with the price they charge against it. And the service staffs should get an award for their super slow service and arrogance. I've never seen any restaurant staff denying to click a group photo with such arrogance!! Yes, the incident happened on the birthday party of my friend

The only restaurant where the waiter asks you for a money as tip.I wanted to visit this place owing to the overwhelming response and the name that¬† I have heard from my peers.But unfortunately I still question why and on which basis people have labelled it a good one.I remember ordering drums of heaven , a plate of chilli chicken and two mixed hakka noodles.Here are the few things that was disgusting and annoying :-
1) The place was not at all clean and untidy and not well maintained.
2) The food which was the worst and I stress on it the worst.I have better chicken items and noodles elsewhere.The Hakka Noodles surely lacked taste and was not well prepared.Same goes with the chilli chicken.Overall the food was just not good.
3) Poor waiter service.No one is particularly responsible for a¬† single table and thus a complete mismanagement.There is one who takes orders only ,¬† the second waiter serves you food and you call the third for water.
4) We actually had to ask the waiter to serve us water which is the most basic thing you are offered once you step in.Had to ask a couple of times before we finally get it.
5) Another thing that annoyed me here the most was the noise level.People literally shouting and chattering in full voices.
6) Last and the most hilarious thing that ever happened was the time when we did not pay any tip to the waiters and the head waiter comes in says 'ki kuch to de dijiye bhaiya' and we were like awestruck.
Overall a very bad experience of fooding here and definitely no coming back and stop people from going to this place too.

I remember this place from my college days... Went back after many years today (almost 8yrs)... Was surprised to see the condition of it. The entire restaurant was in a mess, dirty, untidy.. We were given one menu for a group of 6 people.... We literally had to ask for menus. 
We placed our starters, main course and dessert orders... Our soup & starters came quick, how're ever it was not the same with the main course... We had to wait quite a while much after we finished out starters. 
The food quality and taste was way below than that of a street vendor. 
The worst part was that there was a bowl with Chilli and lemon lying on our table which had come along with the green salad. We had used a couple of lemons from that and left the squeezed lemon wedge in that bowl.... The waiter when clearing out table took that same bowl with used lemons and served it to another table.... I couldn't bear this place anymore and we left after informing the table who ended up receiving our used lemons... 
Poor food, poor service, extremely dirty dining area... Not worth a single penny.

First glance at it and you see yourself at a huge bar cum restaurant, with g+2 parking facility within the premises for 2 and 4 wheelers. Ample space! As you enter the place, you are more inclined towards the cleanlineaa of the place. Tidy I would say. Everything you would like to have at a standard hotel! No doubt about that! But, as you start checking the menu and then placing orders one by one, tasting them and trying to rate them... you dind yourself tangled amidst average quality food,quite overpriced (especially considering the location) and not a great service by the staff Thats where they let you down! But if you're up for drinks, just drinks and some starters, you wouldnt mind!!
Overall, a good place to hang out for youngsters to middle aged groups. But not for those who want to have tasty food!

I had been waiting for so long to visit this place.. This place has got so many good ratings on zomato.. But it totally disappointed me.. Me with some of my friends n juniors visited this place a week ago.. We were 10 in total.. It was around 9pm when we reached the place.. We had no girl In our gang.. Still we had to dine at family section, as no other accommodation was available... N of course it was devoid of alcohol..üò¢ Now I come to the behaviour of the staffs.. It doesn't matter how good food u serve, how good the ambiance u have, what matters most is the behaviour of the waitors n the staffs.. We had ordered Mongolian chicken, shredded chicken sticks, fried button mushrooms.. In main course we ordered mixed rice, chicken fried rice n 10 different side dishes.. I ordered for prawn in hoisine sauce n got chicken in stead.. I asked the waitor to check twice before the order was placed.. N after serving they denied that prawn was ordered.. We had to call them at least thrice for serving the dishes.. Even when u ask for water they won't pay attention to you.. The waitor who served us was very much confused, doesnt know any manners..But their manager z well behaved n gentle.. That's why I m giving them 2.5 They deserve 1. It z sad but true, one non sense waitor spoiled our party.. Party at Big boss was indeed a big loss!!!! They need to improve their dealings with customers, if they wish to maintain their fame.. I generally give good ratings to the restros..feeling sad to mark it so low.. To be honest, it has a great ambiance, huge capacity n good food... But I don't think, I ll come back again..üòï

It's one of my favorite restaurant in Kolkata and I am a huge fan of this place. I have been here many times with my friends and family. Awesome ambiance and mouth watering food items. The parking area is huge. Food quality is excellent and the prices are also quite cheap. My all time favorite starters are Crispy fried chicken, dragon chicken, golden fried prawn and mixed Thai soup. ..I don't drink but as per my friends the hard drinks are available at less price than other places.A must go for Chinese lovers.

Huge Huge Huge ambience. The parking area itself was within that.
Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. 
Well, the review comes from a dedicated Beijing-lover (the restaurant just next to Big Boss) and so, this couldn't match up to the expectations I already had. None the less, I loved the starters more than the main course. Dragon Chicken and Crispy chicken, both amazing. They had no babycorn at that time, so replaced it with crispy chicken.
Main course comprised of Szechwan Mixed Chow, which I hated :3 and chicken fried rice along with an awesome garlic chicken and okayish kung pao chicken (very dry, though).
The staff were kind of lazy, or maybe just the heat that they didn't want to be so active.
If I come back to Tangra, (which I sure will) shall only be for Beijing. :)

I have been a regular at Big Boss for over half a decade now and have always visited this place because of their food , their staff and the ambiance ...but off late it is miserable to see their quality of food deteriorating and also the behavior of their staff turning bad to worse - I sincerely hope their owner ( who is a sweet little gentleman always on the move and flitting through the restaurant at all times ) takes serious steps to rectify their mistakes and to get rid of their arrogant staff .....

Now to their Food , I have always been ordering from memory as I have almost memorized their old and their new menu - but this last visit of mine this last Monday spoilt everything - We ordered for their mixed fried rice , the hakka noodles , the veg manchurian , the Special Look me chicken and mixed vegetables with cashew nuts and the korean paneer skewers ....
1) the prawns were smelling and was stale/bad in the mixed fried rice - when I pointed it out they said it was ok - so we went along ¬†
2) There were no veges in the Hakka Noodles - was almost like street food¬†
3) the look me chicken was raw and was sent back¬†
4) the paneer on skewers had some white sloppy sticky stuff oozing out from one side which was yukky almost seemed as if someone had blown their nose into it - we sent that back as well - the worst part was that we were charged for both the paneer and the chicken which were never replaced¬†

After our return from the restaurant , my whole family started vomiting non stop and within the next day we had dysentery , the kids were in a much worse state .

You guess it - it was the prawns - I sincerely wish other customers do not go through the turmoil that we had been through - ONE THING IS FOR SURE BIG BOSS has lost one of their most regular customers

We had visited big boss today for our dinner...but we were really disgusted with the behaviour of the staff..I understand that big boss is one of the best restaurants of China Town but that certainly doesn't mean that they can be casual about their customers..we entered and asked for a table for two..the person had an indifferent attitude towards us as if he's least bothered..even the manager was no where to be seen...I have been to this place earlier but never have I received such horrendous behaviour from the staff. I really don't care how good food you are serving as long as your staffs are rude and indifferent like this..I'm sorry to say but if big boss continues its service like this they will soon lose their place...I'm certainly not coming back here and certainly not recommending any one to come here.I would have rated this place a zero but zomato doesn't provide that option....I personally feel that this place is highly overrated...

Was here on a treat, I must say the restaurant occupies a considerable area in this insanely congested city.
China town is the area where this place is. I dont understand why do people go to Mainland China and other high octane places, when the best Chinese cuisine is served in China town! And Big Boss is one of the brightest shining stars in the Chinatown galaxy.

Serving simple affordable quality Chinese food is the de facto moto of this place.
Quantity is ample, quality is ampler. Dragon Chicken is the bomb, think no more before saying "One Dragon Chicken please". 

I strongly believe in asking the staff about the specials, and I would recommend everyone to do the same. It is the best way make sure you have good dishes on your table. You are all set to have an amazing time if this is your destination for Chinese food :)

The price is on a lower side as compared to other Chinese food joint in the city and the quantity of all main course dishes are plenty for 3 people.  I love their Mongolian chicken, dragon chicken, prawn chips and garlic chicken.

With a nice parking area, the entrance to this Chinese restaurant is quite inviting with a very Chinese feel, with a Chinese statue and a huge fish swimming in an aquarium welcoming visitors. The restaurant upstairs is finely bedecked with pristine decors. Food here is good as well as average. We'd had prawn chips, chili babycorn, chicken clear soup, veg. Cantonese noodles, egg fried rice and sweet & sour chicken. A restaurant that offers moderately good Chinese food, and some items are worth tasting. It may not be the Big Boss of Chinese cuisine, but one can give it a try if one's a fan of Chinese food.

In china town area, among the 3 predominant restaurants, Big Boss has been the most famous so far after Beijing. Today it was my first visit at this place on the occassion of few of my team members' promotion. In the afternoon, we called them up to reserve seats for 16 and also noted down the name of the person who took our booking however, upon reaching there we were astonished to know that there was no such person working there. However, luckily we got hold of the required number of chair and a dedicated space for us.

Without wasting much of time, we placed tge orderes for 3 full dragon chicken and 3 full dragon fish. Later on golden fried prawn, paneer fry, chilli baby corn and many other items were ordered. In maincourse we had veg rice noodles(known as meefoon as well), prawn manchurian, veg manchurian and shanghai chicken. All of the items were ok if not that mouthgasmic.
I would now summarise my overall experience in bulleted form for everyone's ease -
1. Food is ok compared to the price. Can be marked as acceptable authentic chinese preparation
2. They should serve alcohols in 1 litre or 750 ml size as well instead of limiting it to only 375 ml pints
3. Price of beer is very cheap - my suggesion would be to grab as much as possible
4. The overall place and capacity of the entire facility is very big, probably the first standalone restaurant with multifloor parking and huge sitting arrangement with excellent interior decoration
5. Having said #4, the lights should be deemed, there is no need of using such floodlight kinda bulbs in a fine dinning place
6. Service needs to be more faster, in such a table where 15+ people are seated, at least 2 dedicated waitors should be present to entertain their needs.
7. No smoking zone, you have to come down to the road for a fag - not sure if u would consider this to be a good or bad feedback.

Overall nice experience, and definitely worth a place to revisit.

One of the better chinese restaurants of Tangra(aka China Town). This is definitely one of those places where you can visit with your family, unlike other restaurants at tangra. Once you enter the lane with all the restaurants at tangra, you have go straight, Big Boss will appear to your right. 

We had Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Red Pepper Fish, Singapore Chicken and Fried Rice. All of them tasted decent, i especially loved the fish. Prices are reasonable. Ambiance was nice.

I would not even rate 1 star. 
Was extremely disappointed by my visit today. I have visited earlier food was good then. Today was the worst experience. We ordered golden fried shrimps and soup for starters. Soup was like hot water no taste. The shrimp looked good but the moment i broke the piece we saw the veins were not removed not cleaned. When we complained they immediately took the plate and cancelled the order. 
For main course we ordered fried rice with garlic fish and thai red curry chicken. Fish was ok. The thai red curry looked like a manchurian dish nothing thai flavor in it. 
Over all the experience was horrible. I will never step into big boss again.

One of the best places for dine-in in china town for Chinese, though being a vegetarian many wouldn't prefer dining in cause of the strong meat smell all around but but those who can stand it, they are in for a treat. Their soups and mains are absolutely amazing having a great chilli kick for all chilli lovers. Just dissapointed with Crispy Chilli Babycorn as they were completely soft and soggy.

We have ordered one Golden Fried Prawn, one whole fried duck of hot garlic flavour, Chicken fried rice, Chicken fried mefoon, Singapore Chicken, Sweet n sour fish, sze button mushroom along with breezer and royal challenge for 4 persons. The food was really good and the quantity was pretty good. One should not miss the Golden fried Prawn as the buttery taste was a treat to your tongue. The duck was cooked good but it was a bit skinny one can skip it. The sez button mushroom was fabulous and the cranberry flavoured Breezer accompanied the food nicely. The ambience was good and the staff were also cordial and this is of course a pocket friendly restaurant... Our pocket pinch was about Rs 3200/- including all taxes.

This restro does justice to it's name. Period.

Pros:
Friendly and co-operative waiters
Skilled management staff
Vibrant ambience, especially in the second building.
Prices are in accordance with the food's quality and quantity.
Maybe the best chinese you'll ever have in Kolkata.

Cons:
Sounds contradictory but the prices might seem a little cha-ching to a few people.
Limited cuisines available.
The seafood here is not as good as they tell you.

The experience was great only that it is situated very inside.We ordered the famous dragon chicken which was definately 10 on 10 . Although I deduced 0.5 points for the serving was extremely lateand also because they served me a soft drink without even asked me and I thought it was free but the charged it for double the m.r.p.¬†
In main course we had fried rice with hot garlic chicken and Manchurian fish.The fish was better although the gravy was gluppy and floury . The fried rice had almost no meat or prawn.
But still I gave it a 4.5/5 for the dragon chicken was terribly tasty.

So after a long time, finally gave this place a visit on a lazy afternoon and honestly speaking, I was pleasantly surprised. Ample parking space, this restaurant is located on your right a little way into China town. Ordered dragon chicken(delicious), chilli pepper prawn, fung chang chicken and prawn fried rice. The flavour in all the food was spot on and one couldn't ask more of a restaurant. However what is a health hazard and something that put me off completely was that the prawn in the rice wasn't deveined. I hope that the management takes notice of this. One thing serving cheap food and another thing letting your customers risk food poisoning.  I would've rated it 4.0 if the prawn had been deveined. Have the sea food at your own risk!

We went to the restaurant for lunch and the experience was mediocre. The restaurant is spacious with ample parking space and the ambience is very good. The food was alright (nothing to go crazy about), but the service was poor.
We ordered Golden Fried Prawns, Red Pepper Chicken for starters along with Chicken Sweet Corn soup and Chicken Clear Soup. The prawns tasted fine (lacked adequate seasoning) and the chicken was good. The chicken sweet corn soup was good, however the clear soup lacked flavour and chicken pieces were extremely bland. The portions, however, were huge. We ordered one Mixed Rice Noodles and shared (4 of us) comfortably. The rice noodles tasted good (except the prawns in it), the usual Tangra special rice noodles type.
The staff seemed to be less caring and it was difficult to get their attention. Overall, an okay experience. Don't know if I would like to return very soon...

Had been there before when the both the food and service was great. Went there today. Promise not to go there again. Ordered starters and main course. One jack ass waiter brought the side dish of the main course and dumped it on the table, when neither the starters nor the drinks were served. I mean how stupid can a waiter be to have served the side dish of the main course when there is nothing to eat with. The 5.8% of Service Tax is not worth it at all with such callous standards and service. Almost had a dried up throat while calling the waiters. Completely messed up now a days. Never ever, will be there again.

Went post lunch time.  The entrance gives you an impression of a huge well guarded space. Walked in with high expectations after hearing so much but it was a huge let down.  Being almost empty, the service was inattention and a huge let down.  We ordered for appetisers. The chicken wonton were ordinary and the drums of heaven came cold.  On returning it another platter was sent but the chicken was so bad! It was literally green on the inside like it was old and rotten.  When brought to the notice of the server he asked if he could offer a fresh portion, which we refused.  He decided to waive if off the bill, which  was appreciated as we hardly ate a bite.  Never going back for sure.

Been there multiple times, and in recent times this is one of the happening restaurants of china town. Anyday u can find a huge crowd, but the place is so huge that they accommodate nicely.. valet parking ensures that you have no problem in parking your car.. Now coming to the food, its really good.. the pricing is very reasonable for such a restaurant and you will get a huge variety in the menu. I prefer the prwan items, as they are available at a reasonable rate here :) in desserts go for the fruit custard with vanilla ice cream, its awesome. I dont drink but as per my frnds the hard drinks are available at less price than other places.. what more?? ;)

Writing a review for the first time. No offence meant. Bad service, very very slow. No idea about how to serve. Main items not in stock. They also take wrong orders as an add on. Fried baby corn super oily. Returned the order straightaway.. Took ten mins to deliver a coke, a room temperature one when asked for chilled. We left. Thank u for nothing Big Boss. 1.5 just for the air conditioning.

If you are looking for a nice Chinese restro with a huge space, nice ambience, great food without spending much, then big boss, China Town is the place to go. One of my favorite Chinese restaurant. The cost is very reasonable here. The food is usually huge in quantity and tastes nothing less than delicious. The Szechuan chicken and Thai chicken are my favorites here. The rice quantity is sufficient for 2 persons. Go and try it.

This place serves awesome Chinese at affordable price. I am in love with the golden tempura prawn, the thin crisp crust outside and the juicy tender delicious flesh inside gets  your stomach crave for more. The main course  food is equally delicious. I Have visited this place so many times but crave for the food whenever eating out is on my mind. The ambience is quite a family affair and when u finish u feel happy...

I had heard really good reviews about this place until I thought of trying it out. The food was pathetic, the noodles were dry and that was the weirdest version of crispy chilli babycorn I have ever seen! 
The place is huge though and designed to attract families. But the food failed to impress us all.

Park your car and have your food some where else!!
Yes. They have a decent parking lot apart from that everything from food quality to service is simply- pathetic!!
Chinese food is known for low oil content but if you dine out here you will get to know how oily it can be.. Dry chill fish and Red Pepper Chicken have no difference!! Everything is just deep fried with litres of oil. Same with fried rice. Sea food soup and sweet n sour prawn were the face savers..
Shabby and non cooperative staffs will make you feel that they are doing you a favour. A fork that fell from the table was lying down for two hours and even when we left! 
From water to food to bill, one have to chase them up at least for 3 to 4 times.
In short terrible!!

Well finally I get a chance to visit the very famous Big Boss in Tangra. Being one of the older restaurants, I have heard a lot about it from its loyal customers. So I actually had a lot of expectations. The ambience is very lively & like most of the places in China Town, it has a very positive vibe. The food is decent nothing extra ordinary. The Canton noodles that I ordered was okay. The Golden fried prawns was fine ( I still believe Golden Joy serves the best Golden fried prawns). But the place won't hurt your pocket. So good place to go if you haven't been here.

Big Boss is most known for it's huge parking space amidst the tiny bylanes of Tangra (more popularly called China Town). Other than that, it is just yet another restaurant in China Town, which is a place where people throng to mainly have cheap booze along with cheap Chinese.

The food they serve is strictly average and my recent visit was a let down. The lemon chicken was overglazed with sugar and tasted too sweet. The chilly potato was also just okay. But my other visits have seen better food.

Overall, I prefer Kim Ling (pretty close to Big Boss actually) over this place any day.

After about 8/9 years came here, what an improvement on ambience, 1st floor parking, at the same time what a deterioration on food quality and quantity. Previously in one plate hakka chow 2 1/2 persons used to be very happy , but now even 2 are not done in one plate, and taste? Our Lord's more roadside food stalls like Annapurna, samrat taste equal if not better at less than half prices.

Ambiance: Awesome
Waiting time in table: About an hour
Food quantity: Huge

Frankly speaking, the food taste was not up to the mark.

The mixed fried rice had less salt in it. That made it taste bad.

The lemon chicken that we ordered was extremely sweet. It was like chicken-Malpua dipped in sugar syrup!

Don't get me wrong, I think they put the chicken within the lemon sauce and boiled them with the sauce. That is why the chicken themselves became too much sweet. If they could put the sauce on the chicken just before serving without boiling them, they could have tasted much more better.

I went with one friend of mine. He could not have more than 2-3 chicken pieces from the lemon chicken. Because the excess of sweetness was making him feel bilious.

The fruit cocktail was yummy though!

Sorry Big Boss... It was our first time in your restaurant and it was not a good experience for us.

Not because this is probably the only place with decent and ample parking space, the food and service is real good and authentic. Visited this place on 1st Feb with family for quick lunch as we  were around that area. We had chicken hakka noodle and shrimp fried rice with chicken in oyster sauce. We all loved the chicken in oyster sauce ...... it was actually finger licking good!!!!! The noodle and fried rice was also well cooked and we seriously tasted some differently tasting noodle after a long long time. My kid liked the shrimp fried rice. Quantity served per dish is really huge and we literally had to parcel the left over which was quite a lot. 
Decor and ambience is also good although not that great to aaw! The bar looks little old school and shabby. 
One important thing...... really found the wash rooms CLEAN and DRY!!!!!!! Rare to find right??? But this place was really clean.
I just had a silent complaint. ...... the waiter taking my order and serving me WAS REALLY POOR IN COMMUNICATION SKILL. couldn't speak English and hindi was equally diseased. 
This place will really not empty your pockets if you understand what I mean. Prices tagged are very apt. 
One more thing I would have prefered availibility of a pint or chilled can of beer but to my dissatisfaction found out that they could only serve you in those large bottles. 
I will still rate this place a notch better over-all
....... 
I am satisfied and will make another visit for sure if I happen to stray close by......

Amongst the handful of restaurants ruling the charts in Chinatown,  Big Boss definitely comes in the top tier. The food here is nothing exceptional,  but surprisingly gives a soothing feeling to your taste buds. The price pinch being on the lower side,  you can order with a peaceful mind.  The proportion is so adequate that,  a half plate can easily feed two hungry souls. Amongst the dishes,  dragon chicken is a must have. Momos,  wantons are equally good. The large dining hall has a nice cheerful vibe in it.  Overall dining here was a pleasant experience for us. 
I almost forgot to mention,  booze is really cheap here.  So don't miss out on that.  
Happy dining!!

I visited Big Boss after almost 5 years to find that they have added glitz to the place at the cost of service.
We were a group of 11 and had ordered both food and drinks in the venue.
We had ask for the waiters repeatedly. The quality of food served was good, but not the excellent standards it was earlier.
The worst experience was when the bill came. There additional quantities in almost all of the items of food and beverage consumed.
We pointed this out and after a little long chat with the waiters, 8 of the  9 items incorrect items were fixed.
We were told that we were LYING about the 9th item.
At this point I asked for the manager. The manager arrived and was rude and unapologetic as his staff. He said he had proof. I challenged  him to show the records.  He declined and asked to leave. We left after paying the money with the vow never to return there and let you guys know about our experience.
Big Boss was my favourite place in Chinatown from 2002 to 2010 because it served the best food and its service was great.

 the food quality isn't that good..both their veg & mixed fried rice

Hi,

This place is good with lots of space. Food is good in terms of price and quantity as well as quality. You should try dragon chicken and golden fried prawns. Both are lips smaking. I tried mixed mifoon which was good but no chicken found in the plate. You can avoid fish in oyster sauce as this is very flat in taste. Service is Good also. They take Cash and Cards. Thanks Big boss for making our anniversary special.

Being a foodie, my family and i were keen on going to this restaurant. Its nice and spacious with round tables which reminds me of the Chinese weddings. Food was good. Service was okish but sometimes delayed. I would always suggest ppl to go to tangra on regular days instead of on festivals if you really want to enjoy good food and decent service as one cannot expect to be served properly on festivals due to heavy rush. Other than that alls fine. Parking here is a plus point as the place is very spacious. So go ahead and have a try üëç Sorry for not uploading pictures as at times when one is too busy hogging on food and talking to family members, you forget to click them üòú

Will write about the food quality rather than the ambience. Ordered chicken fried rice, chicken hakka and chicken manchuruan as a takeaway today. Was excited about the quality of food as had heard great reviews however was very disappointed with the quality. The fried rice was tasteless and equally bad was the hakka. Not sure if I would be recommending this to anyone.

In short if you have plenty of time in hand,  looking for decent food quality and can tolerate forgetful waiters...this place will never be a problem with you.

Bigboss is located at the vicinity of Topsia More. A colossal volume of space is available inside the restaurant with an al fresco smoking zone. Relatively low cost bar and restaurant at the locality . It would take hardly 700 rupees for both drink and devour for two people. If you are there try to test their dragon chicken once.

With the crowd usually out on 1st January, it becomes really hard to get a place at a proper restaurant. Thus, we chose to go to a place that is situated in a prime location. The ambiance of the place was nice given it was full of family. The food was edible. The serving time however was long and frustrating. The place is a major set back in terms of cleanliness. It gives an open space to smoke. Overall, its a decent restaurant with nice food available at a cheap price. In fact, one of the best if you run out of other options.

The quality of food was awful today. Hakka noodle was too oleaginous. The fried rice was unpalatable too.

Went for lunch here on 25th dec, it was my 3rd visit to this place and it was the most disappointing one. As expected, the place was full as it was Christmas, but luckily we got a table for 2. We ordered drums of heaven, chilli garlic pepper chicken, mixed Thai soup, mixed meifoon and dragon chicken. I think, everywhere the soup is being served first, but here it was an exception, the drumsticks came first and when we asked the staff who has taken our order he said that the soup is getting ready.. When the soup arrived, we hadn't finished our drumsticks. So now we had to eat both the items simultaneously, otherwise it was getting cold. Then came the chilli garlic pepper chicken, it was cold and hard. Forgot to say, we were being served water after reminding the person for 3 to 4 times, that too by a different waiter. So, we decided to parcel the remaining items and leave from here. The parcel came after half an hour and the bill came after 15mins. I think the bill was being prepared in the wok. They were only paying attention, to the big families and group. I think, they thought the big groups are paying the bucks and others are on free (bu## ##it). I think Tangra is good for food but worst in hospitality, say it Kimling, Beijing or the so called Big Boss. If you are planning to visit this area then take a huge group with you to get their attention. Anyways, the soup and the drumsticks were really good, specially the soup. The meifoon and the dragon chicken were more than good.
Pros:
Huge accommodation
Huge parking area
Cons:
3rd class service
Lack of management skills

We went there at afternoon of 25th December. We had to wait for 30 mins to get our table. After that we ordered Dragon Chicken which I get from Zomato's suggestion. Quantity wise very good. One plate contains 12 big pcs of well cooked chicken. Then we tried pepper chili fish which was good according to my partner but I found little bit under cooked. After that we ordered Cantonese style Chicken chowmein which has no chicken at all and lemon Chilli chicken is unsual and tastes good. Serving time is too slow. You have to remind them that ordered something. Waiters are little bit careless also.

Visited China town after 3 years and it was to Big Boss. It is one of the largest restaurant in China Town. There is also a large parking space. 
1. Ambience - Good. Separate dining space for family , couples and groups.
2.Food tasted good.Good portion size. However they dont offer lamb , pork or duck if anyone wishes to taste these meats.
3.Moderate pricing. Food for two without alcohol would cost Rs 500 approx.
4. Staff should pay better attention to guests and their needs. Quality of service should be improved.

Quality n quantity n taste of dishes were quite impressive. Only one complaint.... They serve very less variety of drinks.

I had heard so much about this restaurant from friends and relatives that I decided that,I have to try their food.Worst decision made. When it comes to alcohol they only have the basic stuff like scotch, whiskey, rum and vodka. No cocktails or mocktails like they have at Golden Joy. For starters we had ordered Chiili garlic pepper chicken. The taste was okay but after few minutes the chicken got hard and chewy. For main course we had Mixed Fried Rice and Hunan Fish. The rice was alright but guess what, the fish was stale. At first I couldn't understand but the rubbery and flaky texture inside the fish felt not so palatable. It was when I ate the last piece of fish in the bowl that I immediately spit it out after mild chewing. It tasted so bitter that I had to gulp down half my thumbs up to get rid of the aftertaste. I do not understand what the hype is about regarding Big Boss. I would choose Beijing or Golden Joy any given day for a meal at Tangra. And if one craves authentic chinese, then there can be no better place than Mainland China and Chowman. Their fish just melts in your mouth, it's that fresh. Hence, very bad experience and would never visit again.

The crispy baby corn and chilly mushroom were good. I specifically loved the Dragon chicken, pepper chicken, and schezwan fried chicken. But the highlight of the meal was crab claws with hot garlic sauce. Price was worth it. Service as usual was courteous, friendly and prompt.

Wow, wt a place.
Ambience, food 10/10
Speed of service/ response 5/10 - Staff need to be more attentive and understand the customers. I understand, its always occupied, but that what every restaurant owner wants or expects before setting it up.
I felt like, our order taker was not happy with his job.
But must say, food was just awesome. Also coz I was with my special one, the ambience became more pleasing to the eyes.
Overall a nice place, well managed, nice way of allotting tables.

This is not my first visit to Big Boss. However, this time I had ample chance to judge the food. We were group of 5. We ordered Fried Chicken Wontons as starters. Wontons were fried crisp and had just the right amount of filling. Only a dip was missing. But I could do without it.

The Thai soup missed the heat and tanginess.

We ordered one Mixed Chopsuey, a Mixed Cantonese noodles, Mixed Szechuan Fried Rice, Chicken with mushroom and baby corn, Thai Chicken and Ginger Prawn. The Mixed Cantonese noodles and Szechuan rice were up to the mark, infact the Szechuan Fried Rice was excellent. The Spicy Ginger Prawn had the right level of spice with a light gravy. The trouble was with the other dishes. The Chopsuey gravy was watery and wouldn't coat the fried noodles. It had a dearth of protein. The Chicken with nushroom and baby corn had the same issue, runny gravy. I expected a white gravy but that essentially did not mean a bland one. Also the baby corn was undercooked. 

The worst dish was the Thai chicken. It was definitely not Thai. Not a hint of basil or red curry or even lemon grass, it reminded of tamarind chutney you usually get with your Bhelpuri sans the sweetness. Tells you not to order something adventurous next time.

Truth is we miscalculated. If we had ordered something usual like we generally do at Big Boss, we would have been happy. But I cannot forgive them for ruining a common dish like the Chopsuey.

Went there with my friend for dinner on Sunday night.
We have ordered hard drinks, drums of heaven, shezwan chow, and one chicken side dish.
The food quality was zero with absolutely no taste at all. It's better to go to a roadside restaurant as they make better tasty dishes. This place is only for those people who are looking for good quantity with zero quality at an absolutely low budget. Will not recommend to any one looking to have a fine dining experience. The attitude of the staffs were also poor and they even did not serve a glass of water. They did it only after we asked them to do.

A great place if you are thinking of treating a large group of friends! The food quality and quantity is very good and they have a huge parking area so thumbs up for that! The dishes are very reasonably priced and the dragon chicken over here is amazing! The only drawback i found was the attitude of the waiters, that needs to be improved definitely! We were a group of 12 people and getting a table over here wasn't difficult on a Sunday afternoon! A good experience overall!

The worst experience ever - So many people had recommended this place in the famous China town, but it turned out to be an utter disappointment. No ambiance to boast of, unpalatable food, sad and pathetic service.

We could've forgiven the food part of it, had they been more accommodating and courteous - but the staff turned a deaf ear to our complaints/suggestions/requests. In short: Big thumbs down!

Visited Big Boss in Tangra yesterday afternoon. One could never imagine that the dingy shabby lanes could lead to such a sprawling and well maintained eatery. We immediately got a table for four.¬†Good thing is that they have a pretty big parking space , therefore you need not worry about keeping the vehicle. We ordered fish finger, dragon chicken, prawn gold coin, drums of heaven and crispy chicken for starter.¬†One full portion has 12 pieces. They also have option of half portion , in which they serve six pieces . All the starters were yummy, specially fish finger and crispy fish. In main course we ordered mixed hakka noodles and chicken¬†in oyster sauce. Both of the dishes tasted ordinary. The noodles was of¬†thick type therefore those who prefer fine type of noodles could go for fried rice. Towards the end of our lunch we found some egg shells in the noodles. We brought the same to the person who was taking order he extended apologies for the same. Such things are not expected from a restaurant of this stature. Overall, good food, good behavior of staff and decent pricing. Pocket pinch was around Rs.2,000 for 3 adults and a child.

Wonderful Experience *_*
I have already received some nice feedback about this place.And it filled up my expectation from every nook and corner.
We ordered dragon chicken in starter as recommended by zomato.It was awesome.
You must try it and it is quite different from usual starters.Main course was also cool.
One thing i must mention here,that is the quantity. Omg!!A full plate of chicken is perfect for four people.So order wisely.
The ambiance is big and beautiful.The stuffs were very cooperative and cordial.
For people who drink they also have thousands of choice.
And the best thing is it is a very pocket friendly place.
POCKET PINCH:700 For two people(without drinks)

We friends planned to meet over this weekend following the pujas. We were already drying up a hole in our pockets, after all the shoppings, several dining outs during the Durga puja and so we chose a pocket friendly place. The only disappointment was we turned up on a day, declared a "dry day" throughout the city restaurants. The food was not great but good.

Visited this restaurant quite a few times during this year's Pujo. Loved the food and portions, especially the Chilli sauce served. Don't forget to try their Hunan Chicken and Lat Me Kai. Service is quick and the restaurant has ample parking space. However, during the festive season, there may be delays (could happen to any restaurant). If you are looking for a pocket friendly place to treat your extended family at, then this is a good option to consider.

Overrated too much. Bad food, expensive and lousy service. No idea why people hype it so much. They take forever for every process possible. From arranging a seat, to coning over at your table to serving hot food. Served the hot plates almost half an hour before food arrived. Successfully managed to transform a very happy mood into a sad one. Lousy. Very lousy.

But the very fact that they cheated us is not tolerable at all. We ordered 100 pipers and what they gave us is no where close to 100 pipers,it was at most royal stag. And they did not make the peg in front of us.And we even told them about that,and they were trying to lie,which was visible. Also the foods were super oily.

Portion was good, service prompt and the people very friendly. The food was a tad bit salty, but it's fine, I'm a person who takes only minuscule salt. The Singapore noodle was good, but didn't understand why is it called such. The simple chicken fried rice was tasty as it can be. Overall a good place to visit, not tough on pocket as well. Gives you the taste of "Authentic Indian Chinese" food.

Frankly speaking I didn't like this restaurant at all. After reading rave reviews me and 4 of my colleagues went to this restaurant but the only thing we liked is the huge parking space which is very rare in chinatown. Food and service were very poor. We ordered many items-prawn gold coins, dragon chicken, fried chicken wanton, hakka noodles, mixed seczwan fried rice, chilli tofu, fish in hot garlic sauce, fung chang chicken, fresh lime soda and none of the items were good! All very very ordinary, this type of chinese we can get in every corner of kolkata, no need to go to tangra to eat this type of food. They took awful lot of time to serve even when it was not totally full. Service was pathetic, had to yell few times before someone attends us, waiters are not trained, they spilled food all over the table during serving, even dropped fork in the floor, clumsiness at its best..Though the bill was not that high but still I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Went there with friends for a Birthday Celebrations and found the place noce and decent.. We ordered Dragon chicken and was as fiery as a dragon... The pieces were enough for five people.. The fish fingers were also crispy and tasty..

For the main dish we ordered three chicken fried rice and thai chicken.. We were worried about the quantity they would provide but the no of pieces provided was enough for us.. The taste was great.. The chicken was cooked thoroughly and the wait time was also very decent.. Three rice was enough for the five of us and we were quite full at the end..

We particularly liked the great and prompt service and the tasty food there.. The bill was reasonable too..

First of all i was little disappointed with the narrow lanes and the locality.But then when v entered that gate there  was a sign of relief on our face.There is a huge parking space and the interior is also spacious.
The manager helped us to get our preferable seat and we were humbly welcomed.
 Coming to the food v orderd Lut Me prawn!It was one of their special dishes as guided by the manager.And it tasted yum!v also ordered schezwan fried chicken .it was just like any other fried chicken..But we really liked lut me prawn.
V had chicken haka noodles and  garlic chicken..the noodles was well prepared and the garlic chicken well complemented the dish.loved the taste and it was not too oily.
Service was good and the price is also not  high..
reasonable price and good food.overall a good experience and were satisfied with the food.
Would love to visit again üòä

I don't know what other people say, bt my personal experience is not very good..  2 main things of  a restaurant which bring customars are, 1)food quality ,2) price..  Food quality i must say not very much satisfactory, its ordinary one, u can get same quality in any Chinese restaurant .. And the price is too dam high for such quality..

Big boss s car parking facility and it's huge parking space is worth appreciation. They serve good starters... Like chilli garlic pepper fish chicken prawn..... Sezwan fried chickens.... Their dragon fish and dragon chicken are v nice btw v hot... Mind it.... It's almost full house alt time.... It's pocket friendly... BTW services are avg...... Their main courses are equally good. BTW I don't find comfort in their seating chairs.... Sofas are v less.... In the evenings after 8 it totally gets over jam-packed.... With friends for casual outing... It's good... BTW I feel they need to better service and make seating chairs comfortable enough..... with every day quality spcly the size of chickens n fish are getting smaller. They are free to charge 30 rupees more per dish btw quality shud be maintained, found egg shells in mixed fried rice. Nutthing extra ordinary. Ambience is like a fish market.

Went there for the first time today, and was really astonished to see the sprawling parking space. The restaurant provides a nice family dinner ambience, given the very spacious and well decorated interior. Food is on the nicer side, and that too by not burning a hole in your pocket. Only thing for which I rated the place a 3.5 is that, both the waiters and the parking guy literally asked for tip. Otherwise, the service was also commendable.

Visit to this place is one to remember. Great parking space for one. We reserved the entire ground floor for the party. Lots of drinks and bawalis but getting past it u will see they have equally great food. To me it was a great Chinese treat. One of Chinatown's proudest restro and worth the pride.

Well i tried honey chicken and truly speaking it was fried chicken in pure honey. Too sweet to have. I thought it was the dessert. It was horrible and that was the first and last time i was dissapointed.

Big boss was my favourite restaurant in the tangra area..However my last visit was a bit disappointing..I don't suppose authentic chinese cuisine contains so much oil..and yes..the food this time was just that..too much oil in everything..be it the pepper chicken or the gravy noodles..I don't know whether the chef has changed or anything but the excessive use of oil was a big turn down for me..the dimsum soup was good though..and the masala peanut is a hidden gem in the menu..but those are just consolation prizes..the main food was not impressive at all..so much that I had to reduce my previous rating of 4.0 to 3.0 after my last visit there..I sincerely hope they lift up their belts and rectify these points..otherwise they are going to lose one of their biggest patrons soon enough..

A very renowned restaurant of China town(tangra) and mostly popular for its huge parking space n dining area. The dining area is spread over two blocks, so it can seat a huge crowd but then too on weekends there is a waiting due to the large turnout of people,so the early bird catches the worm! Coming to the food now, the food is very good but however on my last visit here which was a Friday n the restaurant was fairly empty I found the starters to be very oily n soggy and cold.The chilli garlic pepper chicken and the Mongolian chicken was drenched in oil and the chicken was not even tender which was js not palatable. This would be expected on a busy day but not when the restaurant is empty. For the main had ordered the hunan chicken which had a strong taste of ginger, it was ok. It had onions and mushrooms in it. Because the previous experience was amazing n had left us craving for this place v went again but was throughly disappointed.

Well I have been here only once on Saturday. With all the reviews I read about this place I have stepped in with high expectations. But this place did not came up with its reputation. What was missing? The authentic Chinese flavour. It is like any other Chinese restaurants near your area and definitely not something you look for at Chinatown. We found shrimps in a chicken dish we ordered. We had to ask for ice cubes every time we ordered drnks. What pulls up the review meter?? Ample space, multi storeyed parking, cheaper drinks and foods. But when we are hitting Chinatown we look for some more than these and this place has to work hard to keep up with the reputation.

Their chicken noodles and fried rice, along with hot garlic chicken is great choice of main course.. Along with hard drinks, you should order gold coin prawn and drums of heaven.. Crispy fried baby corn is ok-ish.. Strongly recommended..

It's a huge, Huuge place with an even larger parking space. :P 

The food here is good but I have had better right there in other joints of China-Town. 

The Shrimp starter was actually pretty good. We ordered Manchurian fish which turned out over salted. The chicken was tender and nicely cooked. 

Ambiance wise, the place kinda lacks energy and service is sort of slow too.

1st review( April 2014) : We visited this place as heard about big boss a lot. a very huge sitting arrangement. cost is moderate. i cant embrace the food. chicken drum stick was so so. crispy chilli baby corn was not crispy... it was chewy. also took BP and Cranberry breezers. rating 3.0/5.0

2nd review (Feb 2016): ¬†Have to edit my previous review bcz of a better experience. Went with family this time.¬†

‚òÖ LOCATION : (2.5/5) China town.. a bit clumsy and if u want to go there by public transport then it can be problematic.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE :(3.5/5) Nice. Chinese lamps.. i like it. But i feel there can be more essence of China.. like some music? or wall hangings. but it was spacious and bright. the time we reached, it was peak lunch hours.. it was crowdy, but systematic.¬†

‚òÖ FOOD :(4.5/5) Ordered half plate Chilli baby corn, half plate Dragon chicken, 2 plates egg hakka noodles and half plate dry chilli chicken.
Firstly we wanted " crispy" ¬†chilli baby corn but the Chinese gentleman, who was the supervisor i think, said "crispy" will nt b available, so we opted for only "chilli baby corn". I am not fond of corn, but It was okayish. 3.0/5.5

Next came Dragon chicken. Half plate consists of 6 pieces chicken. HEAVENLY. thank you zomato for the recommendation. ¬†Its just mouth watering. want to have it again n again n again....... 5.0/5.0

Noodles were nice. 4.0/5.0

Dry chilli chicken was not like which we taste regularly in restaurants. it was like crispy chilli chicken with fried onions. no capsicum or bell peper or diced onions. and a little bit "more dry" than ¬†"dry chilli chicken" :p.. but anyways taste wise nice. actualy after having dragon chicken.. evrythng was seeming okayish. :p 3.5/5.0

‚òÖ PRICES :(5/5) Damn cheep. ¬†3 ppls lunch costed 800 (including tax). How can i deduct point?

‚òÖ SERVICE : (4/5) Prompt service and helpful
. The Chinese gentleman who attended us 2 years back remains same. :) and food came quickly after the order.
1 point minus because of lots of flies. pls do use fly catchers.

Overall the experience was nice.. will surely visit again..

Perhaps the restaurant with the best ambiance in Chinatown ( tangra ) . ¬†the only place where you get Park street ambiance With CHINA TOWN PRICES . ¬†it has two main buildings . both are equally good . to add to the value is the crowd . Most decent & most well behaved crowd in chinatown is found at ¬†BIg boss . ¬†coming to my experience , i visited in early july on an evening . we arrived at 7.15 pm to find out that the main building ¬†is choc-a-bloc full . we were then escorted to the other building adjacent to it . to my surprise the ambiance was almost the same as the main building . ¬†from teeangers ¬†to college goers to office goers to middle ages groups , you will find them all at big boss , which is the reason why you never feel out of place in big boss whatever your age or group maybe . ¬†the buzzing halls makes your experience even more cozy , as everybody is busy talking among themselves . ¬†Coming to food , we were on a tight budget that day . we ordered¬†

1/2 plate chilli buton mushroom = rs 125¬†
1/2 plate golden fried prawn ¬† ¬† ¬† = rs 310¬†
1 ¬†650 ml bottle of carlsberg beer ¬†= rs 220¬†
1 & 1/2 pegs of old monk ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†= rs ( 85+ 45 ) = rs 130¬†
2 bottles of thumbs up ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†= rs ( 30 X 2 ) = rs 60¬†

the chilli button mushroom was heavenly ........... for 125 bucks great value for money .

golden fried prawns were okayish .......... piece sizes ¬†were small ........... I have had better elsewhere .

after finishing of the starters & drinks , we ordered the main course .

1/2 plate garlic fish = rs 235¬†
¬†1 plate shrimp fried rice = rs 140¬†

the garlic fish was both exquisite ¬†as well as exotic ... very well marinated . however i was a bit disappointed with the portions . when one is paying rs 235 ¬†for HALF PLATE , i usually expect either bigger chunks or more pieces .¬†

the shrimp fried rice was also quite nice .¬†

the bill came at a reasonable ¬†RS ¬†1414 ( Rs 1220 + vat + service tax ) ... which ¬†was minimal considering the ambiance & the lovely time spent .

Overall 4.5 from my side¬†

Special advice : Avoid rush hours , because when there is less crowd the food is cooked with more care & some even say that chunks ( or portions ) are usually ¬†bigger & better when crowd is less . ¬†weekday afternoon is the best time to visit .

Went here last weekend with my friends for lunch. This place serves good Chinese dishes with a huge variety among them to choose from. We ordered mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles, chicken manchurian & hot garlic chicken for the main course and crispy chicken as starter along with beer (alcohol is available in almost every restaurant in the China town area, and yes it is quite affordable). The food was cooked well enough to churn out the nice smell that came from it as soon as it reached our table. All the items tasted good but specifically I'll like to mention the hakka noodles was a winner as I've not tasted such a good preparation for quite sometime.
The ambiance of the restaurant is also nice which makes it all the more visitable.

Only USP is huge n clean place which gives you a satisfactory parking experience.
Heard lot about this place but even after my third visit today my experience was not at all up to the mark,rather shocking at times. First day was bhaiduj n we were a huge group,the staff seemed clueless about tackling the crowd! Second day we were a couple of friends, things were good until I ordered a veg delicacy but when unfurled it at home I was astonished to see chunks of chicken. N today was the third time I went there(only coz of hassle free parking)food was of very poor quality, even roadside Chinese food joint's serve better food! 

If u love driving n food isn't a primary concern u can hang in here for a drink!

Visited BigBoss recently, BigBoss is really a big restaurant in China Town, perfect for big groups. Very good ambiance. Foods are also good to respect to price. Momos are so soft and the quality of the chicken in it was great. The quality of the fried rice was also good, and they serve a good quantity also. The side dish was also good for quality and quantity.

Ordered a dragon chicken and a Hunan prawn. Tasted amazing! The mixed noodles was good with enough of egg, chicken and prawn, however the lemon chicken was a huge let down! 

New update. 
Had ordered golden fried Prawn, egg haka noodles and Hunan chicken. The Prawn was hard, not very soft. The noodles was really good. Coming to the Hunan Chicken, the gravy was tasty and had mushrooms were soft too. Having said that, the pieces of chicken wasn't satisfactory, some were friendlier to the teeth, whereas a couple of others were not. The quality needs a bit of improvement!

I was going through the reviews, before writing mine and was a bit amazed by the rating this place got. It was one Sunday when the family decided to have chinese and as Beijing was something which we had tried so many times we wanted to go for something new. We ended up on this place.

The ambiance is nothing great. The plus point is the parking area its a huge one. The staff are not that cordial by the way.¬† By looking at the menu, something was really interesting to me, the concept of full and half. For almost everything in the menu they have the half plate and full plate concept. The seating is not that comfortable by the way.

I ordered drums of heaven, Mixed thai soup, drums of heaven, crispy fried fish on the starters on the starters. None of them tasted good, specially the fried fish was really bad.

On the main course I only ordered fried rice and chilli chiken and to me a road side stall would make much better chilli chiken and fried rice than this joint.

The two things which people would simply love are the parking space and the low price of alcohol.¬† Visit this place for two reasons, first if you want to have a few drinks with friends and some snacks, second it is sometimes very important to have trash food else one would forget what is really called the good food.

A free parking right below the resturant and you are relieved :) spacious seating arrangements and a pretty clean place. The service was quick and good. We called for the dragon chicken which was amazing and a crispy chilly babycorn which was just edible. For main course we settled for a chicken rice noodles which was nice and a prawn in sechwan sauce... The batter to the prawn was very thick which over powered the taste of the prawn. It was a weekend so a lot of rush... I'd maybe experience better on a weekday :)

This place has been on my "To visit" list for a long time given the fact that this is the most popular restaurant of chinatown,kolkata.

I had always loved the fact that this place has a good parking area.I love places that has good parking.

On recommendation of my super foodie friend Taniya ,we decided to try out this place.As it was raining heavily,the shaded first floor parking proved quite a boon for us.

Coming on to the restaurant,this place is huge and has a family feel to it.(I have been to china pearl,just beside big boss,where I feel scared...:P).

We ordered dragon chicken as starters and then we ordered mixed meefoon and fung chang chicken.(I love their fancy names,because they do taste different and great).

The dragon chicken was absolutely out of the world.Crispy outside,so soft inside and dipped in some fiery red sauce.The meefoon tasted good,the taste enhanced by the gravy of fung chang chicken,which was equally good.

Then we felt,we were not satisfied yet,so,we ordered cantonese mixed noodles and mongolian chicken.The waiter asked whether we want it parcelled.We said we are mad zomations..we want it on table.

The cantonese mixed noodles came in gravy and tasted a little bland.The mongolian chicken tasted good.

Too full.

The bill satisfied us even more with its affordability.

VERDICT-Must visit for chinese food lovers.

Had heard a lot about this place from my peers before I finally decided to drop in on a Sunday evening for dinner....
This restaurant has a huge parking space...so bonus marks for that...
The place is quite big...and was crowded when we arrived...the waiters directed us to our table...
There were 4 of us...we ordered chicken Tom yum soup , chicken sweet corn soup and Mongolian chicken dry for starters...the soups were horrible...all I could taste was water and a few pieces of chicken...the chicken,however,tasted average..
Coming to the main course we ordered chicken fried rice,human fish and prawn in oyster sauce...all the items were tasty and they served generous portions...
Pockt pinch was 1400 something for four of us...
The overall experience was not bad...I may give it another shot in future

I have been thrice to this place. They serve the best Chinese food in Kolkata ( solely based on my experience). Their service is also good. The staffs are courteous and they didn't take much time in serving. Every dish looks so fresh when served. It's a big place so there are enough seats to occupy. 
The only thing which bothers me is never ending noise ( may be because i only visit them on weekends) in the restaurant by fellow foodies but that's not the fault of this restaurant. 
If want to relish tasty Chinese food in Kolkata, this is the place!!

If one loves people, clamour, loud chatters and tasty chinese food that is easy on the wallet, tyangra is the place to be, and big boss is the current crown prince of the kingdom! A big parking space with valet parking and walkie-talkie equipped managers make getting in and finding a place here quite smooth. I have always found this place brimming with customers. Food is good and if one is not assigned to a particularly lousy waiter by chance, the service is also satisfactory. Once in a while one might find a brawl brewing across the hall or a really loud group on the next table, but the ambience is, in general, cheerful and well-lit, with families coming in all the time. Alcohol is extremely cheap, and noodles are the best in town. I know some people who can swear by the prawn chips available here! Crispy chicken and chicken hot and sour soup are my other favourites. A must visit!

Going for an outing in china town means a visit to this place.¬†
It's huge with a seating capacity of 300 or more people perhaps.¬†
Look don't expect too much from this place. Food is decent, okayish , quantity is good, mostly people visit here for their reasonably-priced alcohol ! :p
Coming to the food, their starters are good. Crispy chicken, babycorns are the usual good stuff. Don't go on trying something you haven't heard of before, else you'll be disappointed.
In main course we took the gravy chicken chowmein, very bland, not properly seasoned but had enough portions of meat. The haka chow is better though !
If you want to take a side dish, please opt for dry or semi dry preparations, because their gravy preps are not at all upto the mark .
I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody actually as every other bengali does ! But still have a visit if you are on a tight budget .

I'd never heard about this place. One friend of mine recommended and all six of us decided to eat lunch there today. Those who are going to visit by car will definitely like the parking space. Spacious restaurant, easy to locate. Calm ambience, serves 50+people any time so you won't have to wait. I specifically liked the decor. The staff recommended us to try hot garlic crabs for starters and we decided to have golden fried prawns and dragon chicken along with them. But were kept waiting for about twenty minutes or so before the food was served. Specifically liked the golden fried prawns. Thereafter we ordered egg chicken fried rice, chicken in oyster sauce. Egg chicken fried rice was okay but liked the chicken in oyster sauce. Then we decided to try Szechwan fish, mixed fried rice and kung pao prawns. Loved the fish but the rest of the food was kinda okay. Two bottles of Budweiser were also on the table. It cost only 3984 rupees for six people. Overall food was decent with some delicious offerings. Negatives - they take some time to serve your orders and also to take your orders because not too many waiters can be found near your table. Four stars for the food and a half deducted.

Big Boss is definitely one of the best chinese restaurants in Tangra although I prefer Beijing & Kim Ling better. The best thing about this place is that it is quite pocket friendly & the quantity of food served is very generous. The ambience is very good compared to the other restaurants in Tangra. But, what disappointed us was the poor service. We had to wait for about 40 minutes before our food arrived. They served the starters along with the main course which was not what we expected. Now, coming to the dishes. For starters, we ordered Fried Schezuan Chicken & Red Pepper Fish both of which tasted absolutely amazing. For main course we ordered Cantonese Noodles & Chicken Fried Rice along with Hunan Chicken & Hot Garlic Fish. The noodles & the chicken tasted very delicious. The rice was also quite good but the fish disappointed us. It was smelly & not up to the mark. Overall it was a okay experience.

One thing I would like to mention about this place is the quantity, you do get good Chinese elsewhere too but such huge quantities?! well I haven't been to any such place. For the starters, drumsticks can be a very good option if you love chicken without the tangy sauce. We were a group of friends and the review for the fried button mushrooms were mixed, I liked it but most of my friends didn't. The momos were comparable to any other restaurant and nothing extraordinary about them.  For the main course, the rice noodles and mixed fried rice are both good in taste as well as amount. What is very good here is the Hunan chicken, better than what you have elsewhere. The service is alright. If I had to rate it out of 5 it would be 3.5. 
If you like Chinese and planning to dine in a group, this can be the place.

Kolkata and Chinese go hand in hand. And at Tangra it gets exemplified. However my basic problem with Tangra was the peculiar odour at most of the outlets that at times seem irritating and the search for parking. At Big Boss it has managed to change all. breezy interiors and comfortable parking added up to the experience.
The food is flavorsome. Chicken Drumsticks in a lipsmacking sauce, fish fries, prawns, crispy babycorns and the haka noodles - All tasted great.¬†
The best part of the experience was that the place has fair share of families so the ambiance seem more of a family gathering rather than a drunken brawl at most of Tangra joints.

Well Big Boss is my favourite chinese restaurant joint in China Town in Tangra..Whenever I go to China Town its Big Boss in my preference list..However my last visit to this place was not a good one but still i love this place..my rating is based on my last visit..
Lets start with the ambience of this place..it has a huge place,so finding a place to sit is not hard here even during peak hours..
Now coming to the food..on our last visit,the starters we ordered were good but the main course was a let down..for the starters we ordered crispy fried fish and chilli garlic pepper prawn..the fried fish was beautifully made and the chilli garlic pepper prawn was crispy and tasted really good..
For the main course we ordered mixed meifoon,mixed fried rice,chicken in baby corn and mushroom,fish manchurian and garlic prawn..all of them were ok ok nothing special..but the fish manchurian was soft and the gravy tasted good..apart from that all the other main course food was okk okk..pocket pinch was around Rs.2500..
though i feel that there might have been some problem with the food in my last visit,but still this will be my favorite chinese joint and i would visit this place again so that i can have the best chinese food..

Price is very budget friendly and the staffs are attentive and responsive. Coming to the food.. I must say you get one of the best chinese here in very reasonable price. We went for chicken hot n sour soup, drums of heaven, chicken hakka noodles and tung fu chicken. All the dishes are awesome and also the quantity went surplus for us.. They also provides alcohol. We went for kingfisher and tuborg which was chilled and served well.. I would recommend this place as a must visit for the chinese lovers. @arjun Sinha, tanima giri.

This place has got the ambience that will make you want to dine every time.  I been to this place before. Recently I visited it last weekend. Some items have been added to the menu or may be I missed them on my previous visits. There was this prawn dish we ordered , the name of the dish escapes me. But its a rip off from the Chicken drumsticks sort off. The prawns are dipped in a batter and fried and then tossed with some chillies and pepper. Those who look for that kick at the back of their pallette from the hotness of peppers this is thr dish for them. I personally liked it very much. Then there is the sauted veggies. Not a big fan of veg foods but I did love this dish. Baby corns , diced mushrooms, carrots, lettuce and capsicum lightly sauted and served in the consistancy of a sauce. The prawn fried rice lives up to its name. You will see prawns every bite you take and leads to borderline prawn overdose. However its light and refreshing. Must visit if you haven't been here yet.

Big Boss, one of the better restaurants of China Town offers you tasty Chinese food at decent prices. The restaurant has a very big area with high seating capacity and a large parking area.
Big boss gives you the option of ordering half or full plate which is a good. We ordered cripsy fried fish which tasted good. However, the kung pao chicken and the garlic chicken we ordered were not extraordinary. The mixed fried rice and chowmein weren't great either. The portions were good and food was average. I wouldn't say this one's a must try. However, if you're a fan of China Town then try this place.

Food, Service and Ambience are the three things that help you make a decision on whether you should be visiting a restaurant. There is nothing to talk about as far as the ambience is concerned. Infact, the less we talk about it, the better. But there are very few places that can beat the boss as far as the quality of food is concerned. Right from starters to the main course, everything was yum! This place serves one of the best Chinese food that I've had in Kolkata. And all this at a price which will bring a smile in your face when you get the bill. Alcohol is also cheaper than most restaurants or bars in Kolkata. Service is not bad either. This is definitely a must visit for all Chinese food lovers. Also, one thing worth mentioning is that this place has ample space for parking and hence you do not have to think about this aspect while in Tangra.

Fame may get you to places but it's tough to hold the fame.
Same thing happened with Big Boss.
I've heard so much about Big Boss and their quality food, but never had the chance to visit.
So wriggling myself from the busy schedule I had, I went to Big Boss.
Ordered crispy fried baby corn and seafood soup. The crispy baby corn was really good.¬†
And there comes the-
First letdown, the soup, ¬†too tangy, I never had this type of tangy seafood soup.

Ordered chicken fried rice, garlic fish and szechuan chicken as mains.And lo and behold the letdowns, coming one by one

Second letdown- the rice, chewy like it was stale and uncooked.
Third letdown- the garlic fish, looked like someone tossed raw garlic and stirred the sauce, the fish was uncooked and had the stench of raw fish.
Fourth letdown- the chicken, the center of the chicken balls were really chewy, not as soft as expected.

The pineapple juice afterwards came to the rescue.
Had it not been for the baby corn and the pineapple juice I would have given a 1.0 rating.
Generally its "three strikes and you're out"
But the fourth strike ensured me I won't be spending my money here again

Big boss is one of the best places in china town, tangra. The ambience is superb and the best part is that it has a good parking place. Half plate consists of six pieces of chicken or fish and full plate consists of twelve pieces. So a half plate is sufficient for two people. I had mixed meifoon, dragon chicken, mixed cantonese noodles and fung chang chicken and seriously, no complaints at all. Though the service was quite late , the food surpassed all the cons. And what i like best about big boss is the way they serve wine. Unlike other bar cum restaurants , they serve alchohol in bottles( if asked for) and also in pegs. So quite a relief for alchoholics. Me and my frnds ordered old monk rum, smirnoff vodka.

This is my favorite joint in Chinatown when it comes to outing with friends and colleagues and also for big family treats and outings. There staffs are the best among all in Chinatown and they have a wide range dishes to offer which is quite unmatched by any other restaurants in the area. Their space and ambiance make for a decent outing and one can spend quality time with a great value for money. The only issue is their setting is to generalised and one may prefer Beijing for a more personalised outing. Also I would rank Namking higher on the quality and exquisiteness of the food.

Visited big boss today for lunch along with my family. First thing which I noticed was that the place was quite spacious and the restaurant is really big. Being weekday the place was not crowded and the place was neat and had a good ambience. We quickly ordered 1 mixed Thai soup,veg Thai soup, chicken hot n sour soup, golden fried prawn, fish finger ,drums of heaven and crispy chilli baby corn as starters. The service is quite fast. Thai soup was okay but my mum did not like the hot n sour soup but they do not put salt in soup so everyone of us were busy mixing salt and pepper according to our needs (also 1 small soup can be divided between 2 people which is quite nice). The best item in our menu was golden fried prawn and I could have had a plate of 12 prawns alone. The fish finger was not crunchy at all and one or 2 pieces were smelly similarly the baby corn had no crisp in it and it was horrendous in taste. The batter of drums of heaven was not properly cooked and inside I found the raw batter covering the chicken. For main course we ordered Cantonese noodle and chicken sze rice and kung pao chicken. The noodle and rice were good but again the kung pao chicken tasted weird and I have tasted such good preparations of kung pao chicken and this one really disappointed me. Nevertheless I have no complaint about their quantity as one dish can be easily shared by two persons. I would also like to make a note here by saying that the washroom is well maintained(i think its important so just mentioning it) I am not sure but I think the rate chart as given in zomato is not quite right. It's a good place to come with friends for having drinks but coming here for the sole purpose of having food I don't think is a great idea.

the name itself suggests that its the Boss of all the restaurants in China Town. its Big and spacious. and has a great ambiance and vibe. the parking area can itself accommodate two three restaurant if not more. the service is prompt and neat. its expensive but the best part is you don't feel the pinch in the pocket once you are drunk. ;) so order the litre and make large pegs and enjoy the bromance with your buddies.

I had read the rave reviews of this place on Zomato and thought of visiting it. Tangra normally means Beijing for most people so I decided to try out a new place. I went on a Sunday. Sadly, I was thoroughly disappointed. The place is sprawling and has adequate infrastructure to cater to a huge crowd. But the staff is grossly untrained and woefully clumsy. They dropped and broke empty beer glasses on our table while arranging them on the table beside ours. Moreover, attention to hygiene is almost non existent. We could see food lying in the open, uncovered for over 10 minutes before being served to another table. The food came nearly 40 minutes after ordering. We had ordered Dragon Chicken Dry for starters and a few dishes for the main course. They served the starters along with the main course. The reason cited for the delay? The chopsuey took time to prepare.¬†

I would recommend people to stick to Beijing, Golden Joy or Kim Ling while going to Tangra.

Whenever I have gone to china town it has always been either golden joy or beijing.This time I decided to try big bosd for a change and I regret my decision.The area is huge so my expectation was pretty high but Big boss dint live upto it.As starters we ordered Crispy Chicken and Pepper Garlic Fish.The  chiken was not at all good and the fish was smelly.Then we tried mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken and sadly both were equally bad in taste.The rice lacked flavours.The chicken was not at all like the original kung pao I have been having all this years.Price is okay but portion sizes are less than golden joy and beijing and the prices are of the same range.So try and avoid if ur in the mood for awesome chinese.

I went to big boss after 2 years. i can taste and sense that the food quality have really deteriorated.I have ordered Dragon chicken and Garlic Pepper Chicken as starter did not like any of them as chicken was really not fresh.
Main course we ordered mixed Cantonese noodles didn't liked it at all.
Only the thing i liked was the desert "Darsan"

Spread over a large area, this place serves good food and booze. The food is better than most Tangra outlets. We ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken and dragon chicken for starters, mixed meefoon and lemon chicken for main course and darsaan for dessert. All of them tasted pretty well. We had also ordered golden fried prawns on an earlier visit, which was great too. The meefoon, in particular, was made quite well. Since it was a weekday, we didn't have to wait at all. overall a good value for money!

I have been to this restaurant with my friends on last Sunday. Ambience,'huge parking place, variety of Chinese foods everything thing is impressive.. Bt we had to wait for more than 45 minutes to get table. That was quite hectic but after trying the yummy starrers I felt its worthy to wait 45 minits.

Though we had reserved a table, we were asked to wait for almost half an hour. The smoking area is also the waiting area which is not a good thing for the non smokers. Coming to the food..
Sweet corn soup was average
Chicken korean stick was not good
Golden fried prawn was the best
chicken drumstick was not good
And finally the Chinese preparation for the fish fry was the winner. Would recommend that.
Since we took a lot of starters we didn't order much of the main course.
The Cantonese noodles were very good. Mixed fried rice was good too, as the side we took hunan chicken which was very average. lastly the service was fast and lots of parking space but ambience not so great.

It was my second visit to Big Boss. The place was huge and so was it's parking space. The restaurant ambience was quite nice and the food quality and quantity was also good. For starters, we ordered the Golden Fried Prawns (These are like a must have there). With couple of starters, main courses, sides and dessert, the overall cost was quite reasonable. The service was bit slow. But taste wise, the food was very delicious, very Chinese. Enjoyed another visit to Big Boss and looking forward to more such trips soon.

We were here on a team lunch. It was a hot summer day, so we tried to eat less, but with all the foodies gathered, that attempt was a failure. Starting with mixed Lung fung soup, tasty it was. Then golden fried prawn, drums of heaven and Manchurian chicken as appetizers. For main course we took mixed noodles and Malaysian chicken. As my friends were not very fond of hot spices, this was a low spice lunch.

Went China Town(Kolkata) for the 2nd Time and Hopped onto Big Boss. The Dining Space and the Behavior of the Staff and Manager were Respectful. Then comes the Food. Starters were Drums of Heaven & Pepper fish Along With Chicken Noodle Soup which Tasted Awesome. In main Course We had Mixed Fried Rice,Chili Fish and Half Spicy Ginger Chicken which Equally Tasted Good. Surprisingly All these Items Came at A cost for just 1600/-. (3 persons)

I have been to China Town several times. It is the best place to get mouth-watering Chinese cuisine in Kolkata. Big Boss is one such outlet in China Town which attracts the best crowd on weekends. The place offers a huge variety of dishes and alcohol. They do not charge extra tax for liquor here. Needless to say the dishes served here are always over the top. I tried many dishes here from Fish butter fry, Prawn golden fry, soups for appetizers to Thai Noodles, Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Dragon Chicken, Manchurian Fish , Etc, for main course and many more. The staff are also very gentle and well-behaved. The soft music that is always played in the background will make you comfortable to sit here for a longer time.

Big Boss is one of those more popular family joints in China Town located quite close to Beijing..The biggest advantage definitely is their huge parking space and the big dining rooms which can house at a time a large number of diners..Coming to the ambiance the decor is decent and nice..though you may be dissappointed if you wan't to get the feel of having dinner in a Chinese themed eatery..nothing unique or distinct..the staff here is quite friendly and efficient..they serve quite tasteful and typical Indo-Chinese spreads..tangy and spicy,just perfect to suit your palate..this place is not certainly recommended for alcohol since we have way better options in vicinity..Last time we went here we ordered:
Fried Thai Chicken: It was quite nice..one of the better prepared dishes..
Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish: It was nice..but they have overdone a bit with their spices..
Prawn Tempura: The batter should have been a bit more light and fluffy..
Mixed Szechwan Rice: Nice..the rice was prepared well..
Chicken in Oyster Sauce: The sauce was nice..loved the balance of flavours..
Hunan Fish: It was decent,loved the flavour of pepper,soy sauce should be less..
Overall it was a nice exprerience..our total cheque comes to approx Rs.1700/- for 4 of us..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Im giving Big Boss a 3 star bcoz of its gud ambiance and fine service even during its peak hours on Saturday nights.The food is good,but the rice items here needs to be improved.Inspite of being a Chinese restaurant,the pork dishes are missing and definitely should be added.

Very poor customer service. Today we went to big boss and the hot and sour soup was stinking. We made a complain and the manager came and said that he will get it replaced. Then there was one waiter who came in and said sir we are cancelling your order for soup. I asked why ? The reply came sir as I feel you guys won't like any soup! I don't know how dare a waiter make a statement like that. It's really sad to see such a big restaurant provide such pathetic service. I would never go to big boss ever.

been coming here for 5 yrs now and its still on of the fav hangouts for me and my friends. probably because its still sells liquor at the cheapest prices. Also because nobody asks u to leave even if ur njying a couple of drinks with a huge basket of their delicious prawn papad for hours. Best thing about this place is that they sell booze by the bottle here also . So if you have to treat a couple of really thirsty people just order a bottle of your favorite poison and save a couple thousand bucks.¬†
food here is really tasty and u might just end up ordering starter after starter .All of them are just delicious. Try ¬†their prawn variations and fried fish. They make one of the best meifoon in kolkata. Do keep room for desserts as they have quite a few varieties to satisfy any taste buds

Been here on 16April15. Decent sitting area, OK ambience. The interiors are brightly lit. Main USP of this place is the amazingly low price of alcohol here, which combined with a decent variety in their inventory makes it an ideal place for anyone looking for some heavy drinking session. As an example, a large (60ml) Old Monk comes here for INR85 as compared to a minimum of INR100 for a small (30ml) anywhere in Kolkata. Food was good, specially non veg. We had golden fried prawns, crispy fried fish and pepper chicken all of which were excellent although spicy.

My second visit here, but highly disappointed. We moved here expecting delicious Sunday lunch. The ambience here was never very appealing. Still we came for authentic Chinese but this time that didn't happen as well. However we ordered crispy chilli baby corn, veg fried rice, honey chicken and chilli baby corn. Starter was dripping in oil it tasted ok. And in honey chicken it was well understood that it was made from a long time it went stale, chicken tasted bitter. Only saving dishes were rice and the chilli corn. It tasted good at least better than the other dish. 
Never ever planning a visit here again.

Visited this huge restaurant in tangra for the first time and it was an amazing experience as you really get the feel of a real Chinese restaurant here with great ambience of a two tier building and a multi car parking facility then the waiters showed full efforts listening to you which is really very pleasant .
Now the food is brought in like instant as the bulk order came within 15 mins ( yes I am not kidding ) comprising of 7 plates rice and noodles , 4 plates side dishes like chilly chicken and prawn curry , 2 plates starters with drinks and juices on the table making it a value for money and proper organised restaurant .

My verdict - Have parties here you will love it

Well, arguably the most popular restaurant of this side of town, Big boss offers one of the most peaceful dining experiences with the huge seating area and ample hassle free parking.
Have been there on multiple occasions and it does feature in our list of watering holes. Booze is available by the pint and the food is well worth the mention. the standard fare features the tried and tested manchurians and schezchuans and people stick to their staples. Good for both family dining and day out with friends. excellent value for money. star dish- golden fried prawns, trust me you would regret if you dont have it at least here. another unconventonal but greeat dish is whole fried duck, definitely worth a try.
No complains regarding the taste of either chicken or fish, any time we have visited this place and maintains similar taste over the years.
do drop in for that authentic bengali-chinese meal.

Restaurant is well decorated. As it was Sunday so it was crowded but The ambience was excellent . We ordered Drums Of Heaven as a starter..It was awesome.. Crispy too..... Next we order chicken fried rice 2 plate full ( One plate is enough for two) , One full plate chili fish , one full plate Fish manchurian..... Each items was very tasty... They have maintained a good quality..... Though it was crowded but service time was less. Staffs are well beheaved ...... And one thing I must say that its Pocket Friendly ...... we ended our dinner with Cold drinks (Limca).. As a whole Its a very good family restaurant for pampering your tastebuds..... Thank you...

On this Good Friday we had a family lunch at Big Boss. We had Prawn wafers, Drums of heaven, Crispy fried chicken, Dragon fish, Lung fung soup, chicken sweet corn soup & Seafood soup in first course. All the items were very nice.
 
  In 2nd course we had Mixed fried rice, Sichuan fried rice, Chilli mutton, Malaysian chicken & Fung Chang chicken. 

We were firstly disappointed that they don't have any rice noodles (mee foon) dishes to serve. All was finished. Isn't it a odd ?? !! 
Come on ! Its china town ! And you didn't get mee foon for lunch. What about the evening customers ??

And after that we get disappointed for 2nd times, now with the food. Both the rice dishes were tasteless; also lack of salt & pepper. All the gravies was so runny that you can swim in it. In those gravies, the Malaysian chicken had some flavours but the others were miles away from any flavour. 

  As we complaint about the food, they replied that the cook was changed; and we are not 1st to complaining for food. They were also searching for someone better.

  Well !! We had not finished yet ! In dessert we had Fruit cocktail and Fried honey noodles -- both with vanilla ice cream. Both the items were good. 

Now, over all it was a not-so-bad experience. Should we opt big boss for another visit ?? 
 -Well ! Why not ? But not for a lunch. Next time we would opt for appetisers and some boozing.

We ordered Schezwan fried rice, could not complete 2 full plates by three of us. Also we had two chicken recipes with green peeper chicken and drinks in starter. Drinks were served very well by restaurant staff.

Situated at an area named as China Town (Tangra) and a well Known Chinese Restaurant in the City of Joy. Very Spacious and Cleaned restaurant with multi level parking space. So you dont have to worry about the parking. I have tried only Chinese cuisine here and I must say the food is good and is a value for money. I have visited other Chinese Restaurants in that area but according to me it is the best outing for Chinese Food. If you are up for Chinese and looking for a restaurant, you can definitely give it a shot. HAPPY EATING :)

It's like a place out of the Bruce lee movie. Two levels of parking and an entire building turned into a restaurant. One would expect opulence. But once the service started it reminded me more of the likes of Oly pub down at park street. Whatever you order is placed on the table and then you serve yourself. The maitre de is in a rush to get his table back or go home. One of the two. They are very curt in their tones for last order, not possible, etc. The food however is a blessing. Don't try the other cuisines like Thai cause you will be let down. The Chinese food is simply great. Lovely flavours and ample portions. Great for single diners as they have options of small medium and large. Good place to visit at least once.

The place is very big and well maintained. There is sufficient space for parking and hence it is not an issue at all. Better be early to this place as it was difficult for us to find a table on a busy Friday evening.
The starters were very tasty and the quantity was too good. The main-course was also good. The 3+1 offer on drinks on a Friday evening was the most exciting. Would love to visit this place again.

I gave my birthday treat to my three friends at big boss some times back. the restaurant is in a narrow lane in tangra so if you don't own a car take a cab. I liked the ambience. although it does not give you that private little corner or dim lights deƒáor, a person not looking for such ambience won't have any problem. The place is neat and spacious. coming to food, it is mouth watering and the quantity is more than enough. The bill came rs. 1666 for the four of along with beers. so that's affordable. will recommend the place.

Kolkata is ell known for it‚Äôs Chindian food ‚Äì the Chinese population had settled in East Kolkata from about a century back. The Tangra area has more than 50 restaurants ‚Äì and on our recent visit to the city, we received suggestions favoring many of them. We finally decided to visit Big Boss. 

The place is one of the most spacious and cleanest of the Tangra joints. However we felt that the wait staff is not very keen to attend to you, and for anything you want you have to literally shout for them. We started with the Seafood Soup, which was a thick soup with prawns, crabs, egg drops and vegetables. The Chili Garlic Chicken as starter was very decent ‚Äì the trademark Kolkata Chinese taste was very visible ‚Äì a combo of soya sauce, green chilies and chopped garlic. 

For the main course we went for Mixed Szechuan Chowmien and Spicy Ginger Chicken. The noodles were spicy and tasted nice with assorted vegetables, red chilies and chicken except that it was a trifle too oily. The Spicy Ginger Chicken was a disaster -  the gravy did not have any taste at all. Overall, a disappointing outing cost us around Rs 900.

I have visited Big Boss so many times before, but for the last 2 times when I went there I was extremely disappointed with the quality of food & service. Not sure if it was because I visited on a weekday. The vallet parking service was not there, food seemed not fresh at all, schezuan fish gravy didn't look like as it should be, the waiters were asking for tips in an unprofessional manner etc. So, I think i will not visit this place in near future & will look for other better options.

The biggest restaurant in China Town. The restaurant comes in two sections. One in ground floor and another in top. Enormous car parking facility is available.¬†
Coming to the food; its great. Sometimes during festive season, they might serve you cold chicken dish. This is one negative.
Drinks and food, are overall nice. 3.5/5

Big Boss is one of the biggest & classiest hotel of China Town, Kolkata . Decoration, management, service is pretty good . Alcohol service is available . In food, if you go for snacks & starters, it's very good . My favorite starter is Zesty Chicken . Crab dishes is also good . In main course, you can order only Chinese .. some dishes are good & some is average . Overall it's good to visit.

Big Boss is one of the best in China Town, Tangra. If u go in rush hour u might face some service issues however they jolly well compensate with the taste. Its simply a bliss to ur ever demanding never satisfied taste buds. Today I had an wonderful experience while letting their hot garlic black pepper fish melt on tongue bed. Meifoon is worth trying and definitely their other chicken and prawn delicacies. Not a first visit and definitely not my last :)

One of the best things other than food is that this place has valet parking.

The crowd is usual tangra fare ...a mix of college kids...ppl out to drink and then familes....¬†
the food is quite good but not the best ....but considering that you come to tangra to have the tangra version of the chinese food at a much lower rate..this is fine. when i go there i always stick to the chicken ....never experiment with the fish or prawns. But i have seen ppl who have enjoyed prawn and fish here....¬†

I have had good experiences here...and i will go back again and again

Big Boss is one of the popular restaurants in the Chinatown area situated in Tangra. I had the opportunity to go there with my girlfriend once. The ambience is really nice and the place is really spacious . The food felt good on my taste buds with the price being reasonably fair. The service was okay too. This place also has a big parking area  thus people visiting this place with their own car wont face any problem for parking space. Overall a very nice place for a family dinner or a date.

The experience I had at big boss when I went with my family recently has reinforced my thoughts that no other city makes Chinese food like kolkata. The Yos and Mainlands of the world have a lot of catching up to do to be even half as good . excellent parking space and super brisk service were the icing on the cake.

This is the most spacious restaurant in the whole of tangra with two level of parking space... Ambience is ok.... 
However one thing that catches the eye is the lethargy and apathy of the waiters.... When we entered the three of us were offered a table... However we went to another table... There we saw the table was littered with food... The waiters did not bother to clean it until we told them to do so... Then they gave glasses but did not pour water in them until the food arrived.... The service was not good... So deducting 1.5 rating for this....
Coming to the food... 
For starter we ordered half plate (6 pieces) of fried thai chicken... It was quite good but did not have that special thing...
In the main course we ordered 2 mix schezewan fried rice, 1 veg fried rice, 1 half (6 pieces) chicken in oyster sauce, 1 half(6 pieces) chilli chicken and 1 half mix veg with cashew nuts....
Chicken in oyster sauce was good but the one at golden joy is better... Mix schezewan fried rice was of top quality.... So was the veg fried rice... The mix veg is worth a special mention... It was excellently cooked with roasted cashew nuts all over it... We also took 1 full (12 pieces) paneer manchurian as parcel.... 
The total came to 1288 which was ok...  
Would like to visit this restaurant again provided that better service is received... Service was not good when all other things that the restaurant offers ( good food and ambience) is taken into account

This is probably the most spacious pf all restaurants in China town.Ample space with even a bigger parking space is the plus point.the decors and aambience is good.
the foods are quite tasty and the amounts are also more than adequate for an average eater.
the service is not too prompt,maybe because of the huge seating accomodations and the price is comparitively higher than others.
all in all,if u are looking for a place with a large group at chinatown thiss maybe your destination.

Made this trip to this area after years. Had two close friends with me, Though my first visit, my friends have been to 'Big Boss' earlier. 

Food was very tasty. For a change we stuck to starters only and this turned out to be a wise decision. The fish (Fish Dragon) was excellent and impressed us a lot - we had to repeat order this one. Even the mutton preparation was very good. Prawns were so-so. Plus point is they also serve half portions.¬†
Big Boss has a very big sitting area and can take in a big number of guests. For a Monday evening the place was quite full and I guess it must be popular.

GREAT FAMILY RESTAURANT
Though I went with my friend for lunch, it's good for family time as well. We ordered pepper ginger garlic chicken for starters, and egg fried meefoon (rice noodles) & schezwan button mushrooms for the main course. The food tasted yummy! The chicken was tender and balanced in spices. The meefoon was soft and not at all oily. The mushrooms were lightly spicy & delicious. We had drinks as well and the bill was not more than 1400. The quantity given is great. A full plate of the chicken had 12 big pieces, & the full plate meefoon can serve two to three adults with ease. Satisfied gluttons we returned!

I went dere yesterday for d 1st time. Dis place is quite spacious nd i liked d seating area. You can have ur tym nd chat while having food. It gets busy in d weekends nd holiday. Coming to d food...
Starters: Thai fried baby corn, Fried Schezuan chicken....both were gud. The coating was crisp nd not overtly coated. Chicken was very succulent.
Soup: Chicken sweet corn, Veg hot n sour.....enjoyed both
Main: Egg fried rice nd noodles....nothing to complain.
Paneer manchurian was good.
But d Lemon chicken we ordered was so sweet nd syrupy,felt like dessert.horrible. Thank God we ordered Half plate only.
So we ordered Singapore chicken nxt....was just average.
Desserts: we had Black currant nd chocolate ice cream.....d Black currant was too good.
Pros: price is affordable.
Option of Half plate available which very few provide.
Cons: dey mistakenly billed Manchurian Prawn instead of Manchurian paneer. We payed 150 extra. Our mistake we didn't check properly.
Overall nice experience.will visit again.

Situated in Tangra, and popularly known as Chinatown, Big Boss is one of the authentic Chinese food hub of the city. You will find almost anything you need, dipped and fried in those typical sauces. Since they also serve alcohol, you will find some very nice starters to team with your drink, golden fried prawn being one of the best.

The best part, apart from food, is the ambience and space. It's actually huge, and the food is served pretty quick. You will definitely feel 'China like' inside. Will soon hop in there in some time.

Situated in Tangra, the Restro-Hub of Kolkata, Big Boss is one of the highlights of the area.

Food & Drinks: Food is tasty and sufficient in amount, especially the starters. The variety of food and drinks available is good. The pepper chilli mushroom, fish finger and crispy fried chicken are really good. I rate it 4/5.

Service: This is a HUGE restaurant. Recently they have added an extension. It is now virtually impossible for them to run out of space. So rush hour or not, you will get a table. Speed is a bit low during rush hours. Staff is well-behaved and attentive. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: It has comfortable seating and good music. Light is a bit low. Decor is very good but not extravagant. Good for all occasions. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Pretty standard. Some items may seem a bit costly.

Overall, I give it 3.5/5.

I went there with a few business colleagues (all men) for dinner at the place. We we shown a place full of noise at the corner, where everyone totally drunk were shouting their lungs out.

I asked for a quieter place, so that we can have a peaceful dinner, but were told, either sit here or choose a different restaurant. Eventually we had to walk out.

pathetic behaviour by the place, i used to be a regular before, but would hardly every go after this.

Big Boss is another well known restaurant of Kolkata. Its known for its food quality and ambiance. Many people come to big boss for their dinner and small parties. They have two big complex to house many incoming foodies. Though service of Bigg Boss is not that good compared to other restaurants of Tengra , but the food quality is great. People might say it has detotiated but most of the people still visit there. If you take drinks the bill can get affected because of that as the price of food is very low compared to the quality. Ocassionally it also takes a bit too longer to serve the food. But you will love coming here. Must visit if you are gonna visit China Town.

Has deteriorated over time. From the very look of the place to the food quality and service, things have changed for worse. The mixed fried rice is taste less and the chicken is stale. Waiters ask for tips at the end of your meal. The toilets are dirty and its odor makes me puke. What bothers me the most is their degrading food quality. Had a bad experience after a long time. This used to be my favorite place few years back :/ But there is adequate parking space here. And I still like the ambiance. I like the fried crispy fish and prawn chips as starters. Love the chocolate ice cream they give.

Rest is wonderful, the food quality is great. Try the Crispy Chicken you are a chicken freak like me. The noodles dishes are also good. I liked the American Chopsuey there that tastes pretty good.¬†

Among other amenities I must say about the parking facility and the easy to access address from the main road. Big Boss you rock!

Of my combined visits to Chinatown, I have ended up at Big Boss 80% of the time!! Conspicuous and really easy to locate with very convinient parking option. 
It occupies the comfort niche of being easier to locate than likes of Kim Ling, and more pocket friendly than Beijing. So, I have somehow always gravitated towards this place. 
Unlike other places in Chinatown, Big Boss presents you with well lit ambiance and spacious seating. The floor manager is a pleasent man who always greets you with a smile. Service is one of the best in Chinatown. Very friendly to your pocket as the quantity of food is huge. Half plates are more than enough to satisfy two people. 
I love the Shrimp Balls. Chicken Satay, Thai fried Chicken, Pepper Chicken are to go for in appetizers. Lat me kai is also really good. The cantoneese noodle is really yummy here. Very well seasoned and tasty. All chicken n prawn side dishes are delicious. You cant best the quantity they provide. The only thing lacking is availability of pork dishes. 
Be it just two people or a large group, I have never had to wait here. The servers are always attentive. You dont have to hesitate while ordering alcohol. What more do you need to be happy!!

I have always been very skeptical of the restaurants in the stinky part of kolkata; chinatown. A place dotted with tanneries had always reeked of unwholesome smells when our car used to go past it. Over the years, the chinese restaurants situated in Chinatown started gathering fame over the years. For the first time I ventured to the shady lanes of Chinatown in search of a decent joint. I heard of Big Boss from some acquaintance and landed up there. They have a decent parking place.¬†

The first thing that hits you is, this place in not an upscale place like Mainland china and the ambience, decor, etc, are mediocre. The waiters are not polished but polite enough.¬†

What caught my tongue is the food. All that we ordered, were flavourful and wholesome. The soups ordered, Tom Yum Mixed, Seafood Mixed and Chicken Hot n Sour. The soups were delicious and overloaded with chicken/seafood/vegetables.¬†

The quantity of the food was decent. The prawn dish was comparable to one I got in Mainland China. The noodles, rice and chicken were really nice. The Schezwan chicken could have been more spicy. The chicken was a bit fibrous. However for the price I do not complain.¬†

Overall it was a good experience and value for money.

This place is part of the much famed big 4-(akin to the accounting world) joints in Tangra. The other three being Beijing,Kim Ling and Golden Joy.I guess not many die-hard foodies in the city of Kolkata will dispute the above-mentioned statement.

Now coming on to the main point of discussion-food, what else!!

Items which we ordered:

1. Dragon Chicken

2. Pepper Chilly chicken

3. Chilly garlic pepper fish

4.  Mix American Chopsuey

Amongst all the items mentioned above dragon chicken was the hit item and the winner hands down.It comprised of fiery red cubes of chicken sauted in red chilly sauce along with onion,capsicum,green chillies and carrot and garnished with cashew nuts.The dish had a sweet tangy flavour with just the right amount of spices in it.Went perfectly well with the drinks that we had and our culinary experience had kicked off on a right note.Other items like the Chilly garlic pepper fish cubes of (basa?) fish fried with loads of ginger,green chillies,green pepper chilly chicken were all dry items and complemented our sweet & sour american chopsuey perfectly well.The major letdown was the absence of lamb and pork dishes in the menu.They had a sole mutton dish on offer.However i had serious doubts about the Chinese version of mutton and thus avoided it.Though i had serious cravings for red meat for the occasion.

Please note that like in most Tangra joints there is the concept of half and full plate.A half plate of side dish comprises of six pieces and would be ideal  for a couple. For a larger group/family a full plate would be just right.

Booze: There was an offer on Bacardi white rum- for 2 large pegs, 1 peg was free.At Rs 140/- for a 60 ml peg, i would say that it was a steal.The drinks menu is basic and adequate.If one is looking for premium stuff and sophisticated cocktails then sorry friend-this is not your kind of joint.

Service & Ambiance: The dining area is huge,spacious and a separate smoking zone is the icing on the cake. Staff are polite,courteous & knowledgeable but not attentive enough.We had to strain our vocal chords to place our repeat order for drinks and take-away.The sauces and ¬†green chillies soaked in vinegar was not filled up at our table and the same was done at the fag end of our meal.The in house green chilly sauce was missing in action.

The biggest plus of this joint is service is not rushed up,prices are very pocket friendly,food is tasty and good enough if one orders the right dishes.If one is looking for uniqueness  and premium experience then this is is not the joint one should be targeting. My friend and myself  thoroughly enjoyed the long,slow dining experience at a leisurely pace after almost a decade once again at this joint. And that is what matters at the end of the day.

Big Boss has been witness to many a celebrations of our family and it is a personal favourite of My Uncle and Brother -In_law...but recent visits have undoubtedly proved that the food quality has gone down. It took me 5 visits to finally nail to the point that the food is always less in salt. Our last visit was this Sunday when a friend took us out for a treat. We ordered Korean Chicken Stick which are basically Chicken In stay sticks with garlic ginger soya and red sweet chilli the main ingredient and it is indeed a good choice as starters. For main Course we ordered Chicken Chow (Hakka) again Was devoid of salt and it tasted blunt. The Schezwan Mixed fried Rice though again was not cooked with ample salt was better than the Chowmein...The Chilli Garlic chicken was good but nothing great. Over all food was not piping hot, Service has deteriorated.

I have been here twice; first time for a friend's birthday treat and next time for a date. The ambience is sober. The service is good. The servings are generous in amount and delicious. Gps is needed to locate the eatery as nearby people have a tendency to misguide you and lead you to different eateries because of the tough competition in Chinese cuisine.

I had lunch there, for two consecutive days. The lunch buffet consists of a soup, salad, main course and a dessert, veg and non veg both. They also have a Chinese counter, which lets us choose A la carte Chinese/Mongolian food. (pasta/noodles). Though it is self service, the staff is extremely courteous. The ambiance is professional. It is apt for a professional meet-up, or something like that. Slightly over priced.

My cousin and sis-in-law took me there when I visited kolkata recently. Must say the food is mighty impressive. The only thing which wasn't to my liking was the chicken wanton (too much dough, too little filling). It's one of the best places I've been to in kolkata in terms of food. Ambiance is nothing home to write about but who cares for the ambiance when the food is this good and so super cheap!!! Left the place with a big, happy smile on my face. Keep up the good work!

veg wanton soup also makes a good pair with it..
love the desserts too..
a must visit restaurant of tangra..

Amazing food at low price... Ordered prawn gold coin and mixed Chinese chop suey... Prawn gold coins were crispy and delicious as expected... But wasn't happy with the mixed Chinese chop suey.. Though it tasted good.. But they didn't served it with the egg (m not talking about the poach thing on top which is a speciality of American chop suey) as they promised... Otherwise good food.. Enough quantity for two...
P.S _ the prawn gold coin was so delicious I have forgotten to take the pictures... :)

Have always heard of Tangra-the hub of authentic chinese food!! visited Biggboss with family! The food was good,though we had to wait for a long time on a hungry sunday afternoon! We had ordered typical Chinese dishes as my family wasn't too keen on experimenting..as regards food,i just found everything very normal that one should expert from a chinese restaurant...but it's definitely value for money..good quantity at a reasonable price..but if chinese is what i think of i would prefer something within the other food hubs of Kolkata rather ¬†than burning fuel and going to bigboss..

I started liking chinese post I visited this place last summer, per my friends request. Not just for the food but lots of other thing. Especially my love for Vodka. It compliments so well with the 'Dragon Chicken'. The ambience is versatile. Like a date, A family affair or a lunch with friends (when I say lunch, I mean it..Dont take chances with the transport at night). You have a seat for every occasion :)
Food is authentic chinese, pretty close. And the price they charge. You get 14 pcs. of chicken in the starters and siders, which is cheap as respect to 250 bucks they charge for one whole plate. 120 bucks for a regular main course. Booze costs less than 200 per peg (60ml)..that makes u smile
No comments in the parking for I don't own a car :) I use that for smoking
Areas of improvement - Yeah! Couple of them:
1. Service - Must improve
2. No cocktails at all
Barring this, I have to really fight with my mind to pin point a blooper.
Conclusion: I will be going to Big Boss this Saturday

They provide parking and that in itself is a huge plus point. The helpings are very generous. The spacious interiors make it possible for huge numbers to dine at a time without feeling crowded. We had dragon chicken, prawn in pepper for starters. Rice noodles and Oyster sauce Fish and Chicken Tung Fong(or something similar) for the main course. Also, the sea food soup with egg and crab is a must try. its a rich broth ideal for a winter evening.

Just visited this place on a November Friday night. As a college goer I have visited this place numerous times. Living out of Kolkata for some now, I am happy the way this restaurant is continuing to keep customers in "high spirits" with its pocket-friendly delicious Indianized-Chinese cuisine. We friends were delighted to receive the steamed fish prepared by special order. The chicken, prawn and fish starters were amazing. The area is large with ample parking space so you will most probably get a table on arrival. Ambience is good for China Town and the food is good.

I went a couple of months back with my friends. I for one, had never been to China Town because I'm so new to the city itself. So out comes my friend with an idea to visit Chinatown (I'm glad he did) and the moment we stepped into the boundaries of Big Boss I frowned and told him I don't have that kind of money to dine in such a fancy place (c'mon we're students and I came to Kolkata on vacation). He assured me I'm gonna be surprised. We entered the place and I was instantly fascinated with the ambiance which did not reek of Chinese¬† authority, rather it was a blend of a matured Kolkata and China.

We checked out the menu from which he insisted to try out Baby Chili Corn and Malaysian Chicken, we also took two plates of Mixed Fried Rice and believe me when I say this, we were three people, and could not even finish the bowls of¬† rice. With a full bowl of Corn, two chicken dishes and two bowls of rice the bill was around 850, rather cheap it was. So now about the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Ambiance
2. Food
3. Price
4. Quantity of food
5. Good nature of waiters
Cons:
A little isolated. I remember we had to wait half an hour for an auto or bus to sealdah.

Would I come back? Absolutely yes!

A visit to Kolkata cannot be complete without going to Chinatown. A family lunch to Big Boss it was. Particularly since they have good parking space unlike other places in chinatown. They are also a big player and previous visits were always satisfying.
Staff was very good. Service was very fast.
Sides we had thai fried chicken and thai fried babycorn. Both were a revelation and extremely good in taste. We also had drums of heaven and it was good as well.¬†
I particularly wanted 'Gravy noodles' . Heavenly indeed. Perfect taste of the gravy and the quantity is HUGE.
Egg Meifoon was also very good and quite unique in taste.
I don't remember the name of the gravy chicken dish we ordered. It had some tamarind flavor which made it more unique than the usual chinese stuff.
Mindblowing lunch and very economical.
Ambiance is very good and enough seating area with decent distance between tables.

With Palatial building, Sufficient parking space & Great ambience, The Name Big Boss is really suggestive among the legendary China town. But coming to the food & management, it is disappointing in my recent visit to the place. They have put up a roof top extention these days, in which the service is too slow thus inadiquate . Coming to the food, it is the same old un-interesting menu, in which a number of items are not available. ¬†The tofu items were uncooked in some parts, & the Rice noodles or the chicken or the prawns in the main course wasn't any special . What i liked is the Fruit ice-creams, and some desserts which were real appealing in taste & textures.

The most famous restaurant of china town, heard a lot about it from my friends and finally get a chance to dine there. Thanks to my senior dada of my department for the arrangements. At first look it's different from others..a huge place with plenty of space for parking any vehicle. The restro was massive in size with different section for family and others. It was well decorated and specious. Environment and serving was good. But the taste of the food did not match the quality of it's interior. Hope that next time it won't disappoint us..

From my childhood, I have learnt from my foodie father that you say 'Chinese' and that is China Town of Kolkata.
Big Boss is the crowned jewel of this area if we consider as per the popularity.
They have renovated the place for a few times just to suit our lifestyle in a modernised way, which I liked the most.
The introduction of a family area suited the people like my father looking for a place different from the 'che-che-pe-pe' of the young people.
The booze is good and suits the pocket load of everyone.
The food quantity and quality is not awesome but good.
The staffs are organised and understands the mind of the customer.
The ambience may not be suitable for all(it depends).
I loved the noodles, chilli chicken and the fish items.

If you want cheap booze in a decent family restaurant, China Town offers you plenty of choices. Arguably Beijing is the most renowned one, the most popular is Big Boss. There are a number of reasons why I prefer Big Boss over Beijing - 

Adequate parking space
More carpet area
Smoking corner within the premises
Friendly staff
Decent food

Went there last Saturday with my friends for a fun outing. Among the starters, I loved the Dragon fish. Golden fried prawn was too oily and crispy chilli baby corn was not up to the mark. Soup wasn't bad - note that the 'large' variety can be shared among 4-5 persons. For booze they only offer the basic ones with no option for cocktail. Among main dish, the honey chicken was dreadful and again too oily. 

Turn around time of the outlet is excellent. There are plenty of staff which makes life easier to locate one and place your request at the time you need anything. Overall staff courtsey is good. 

I always love this place and will definitely go back there when time permits.

Dad took us there on an official function to start off with, but then it soon became our favorite hang out spot.In the starter we had Drums of Heaven and Sliced chicken.
The amazing mixed noodles and crispy chilly chicken used to enthrall us everytime we visited there. The manager with a smiling face used to guide us with the best of the in-house items. It's a must visit!

When you enter, you find this spacious 2-storeyd restaurant, always crowded. We had gone there to celebrate our new car..it was a Sunday Lunch...and the restaurant was packed.¬† My friends keep on visiting this place and I have always heard great reviews about it. And, so I recommended my dad to take us there, and we were not disappointed. Food was really good and affordable cost.

I love this place. Don't mistake the rating. But, while sharing honest feedback and rating, I couldn't bring myself to give a higher rating than this. The ambiance, depending on which part of Big Boss you are sitting- the new complex or the old building, varies between various degrees of okay to moderate. One thing is for sure however, wherever you maybe sitting- the place is spacious and accommodating. For that reason itself, Big Boss can have enough higher ratings. It is just ideal to hang out with a large group of friends or colleagues and chill out on a lazy weekend evening or a after office soiree.¬†

Now about the food. Well, there is frankly nothing much to say other than indicating the average-ness of the dishes. The food and alcohol are both quite cost effective, so you won't be disappointed. Service is timely.¬†

On an average, a great place to hangout at, if you are not paying much attention to food, it is quite good, mind you. But if you are looking for exemplary Chinese, this is not your place. At the price it offers, it is tough to seek out better places that boast of a good ambiance and service plus quality. If you are looking for better food, head elsewhere. Big Boss nevertheless, won't come as a disappointment when it comes to food- the soups are generally nice; although once we received a bowl that was as cold as a turkey. But I always look forward to visiting.

This restaurant is one of the favourite joints of Bengalis who frequent China Town. This is the best place if you are in a large group and want to have economical food and alcohol in China Town Area. The reason that this place is always filled with people and is very crowded. I personally do not like to be here if i want to have a quiet meal in this area but if its a treat by friends then somehow i have observed there's no better place than Big Boss. The food as usual is good... i freak out on the prawn chips here. Simply amazing!!! The mixed fried rice is equally good including the red pepper chilly chicken item. In starters i liked the pepper fried chicken and in soup its nothing but chicken sweet corn always. Food and alcohol is reasonable here so next time you are i a group you can try this humongous place. You also have ample space for parking which is an added advantage.

This is one huge place in Tangra with ample parking place and very popular among the Kolkatans.. I had gone their for my drinks and food umpteen no.of times mostly with friends.. The decor is nothing to rave about and it is always so packed with young ppl that you feel like you are in some college canteen. But never mind, the food is very good here specially the starters.. Red pepper chili garlic chicken is one of the BEST... the prawn starters are equally good. The main course dishes are reasonably okay.. Huge variety though.. Service is also quite okay which obviously deteriorates during rush time. Overall a nice place and very popular

It's unfortunate that a restaurant of this class serves just some ordinary quality cuisines. Chinese cuisine was not at all up to the standard. Again Tofu dishes are not good. Pan fried tofu was horrible. Apart from food everything else is good. It has a large parking lot which won't be out of space. Serves alcohol ????, so u won't get bored. I personally like the ambience of the place.
But come on guys you need to touch the taste ???? buds of the customers to stay up high in the market.

I have been in Big boss a few times with my friends. It serves one of the best indo-chinese food in decent price. The food is tasty and the quantity is good. two people can easily share a main course dish. The ambience is also good, it never gets too loud inside and this is one of the few places in china town where you can go with your family.The service is also good. The foods are served within 15-25 minutes after the order.

The only reason I am deducting a point from the rating is that they have very limited choice of cocktails to go with the good food and snacks they serve. Also on a few occasions I have found the alcohol content to be less in the cocktails than what it should be. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†
The best dishes according to me are (I cant remember the exact names):
Starter: fish fry and chicken wanton are the best but prawn chips and crispy fried baby corns are also pretty good.

*Note :This one of a very few places that use original (kujo or deshi) bhetki in the fries and not bhola or bombai bhetki.
The wanton's are soft and very tasty BUT do order them early as they take quiet some time to serve these.


Main course: Any noodles (Schezwan,mixed,etc.) is good. I have not tried any rice dish there ,so can't say.The chicken and prawn dishes are also good in general.

**Note:The Schezwan items are really hot here. If you are not accustomed with really hot food , I will suggest asking the waiter to reduce the amount of pepper.

Desert: Have not tried a lot. But in general all the ice creams are good.

All in all this is a good place to hang out with friend and family.

NOTE: AS STATED ABOVE, Rs. 400 IS IN NO WAY ENOUGH FOR 2 PEOPLE. ¬†FOOD FOR 2 PEOPLE ¬†WILL BE AROUND 700-1000 AND WITH LIQUOR IT CAN GO UP TO 1200-1800.

D waiters who were serving us are probably new coz they are about most of d wishes.wen asked anything about a dish they gave vague answers.anyway coming to food I don't remember all the names of food wch we had. Thai soup was good. Coming to main course, we ordered noodles. Noodles was like boiled only n it was salty. Side dishes were ok ok.

A little pricey for the food and the ambience.. But judging it on food alone, this is a decent enough place to feast on Chinese delicacies when in China Town ..
Red pepper chili garlic chicken is one delicacy that you should never miss.Notable mentions include Crispy Chicken and Kung pao chicken.. the prawn starters are equally good,as is the prawn papad.
The alcohol is moderately priced,making it a haven for people looking for a drink with really good starters.
Definitely a huge thumbs up for the ease of parking my car..

Went to Big Boss last weekend with my family. Overall ambience is quite nice with ample space for parking.  They provide a valet service and one can avail that service as well.
Now coming to the food, we ordered the following:
Drums of heaven
Fried prawn balls
Mixed meefon
Thai Chicken curry
Fresh lime soda

The drums of heaven was awesome. It was not the typical RED coloured, over sized (with the help of flour) wrapped in silver foil stuff that one gets to eat at every other place.  Rather it was devoid of all that and that's exactly the reason why it was awesome.  It was crispy and crunchy and not oily at all
Fried Prawn balls were nice and so was the meefon. 
Again special mention for Thai Chicken curry. It was really nice, a bit spicy and tangy just the way we like it :-)
Cost of food about 800 bucks incl of taxes.

This place will not turn your mood off, neither will give you an urge to visit it again. Staffs are really good and well-mannered. Ambiance is not so good, place was almost crowed and can hear howl/yell of the people. The good part is the taste of food. Quantity of the food was good enough to make feel that your money has not been wasted. For regular visit you can try but for some special occasions you need to rethink.

Everytime I visit Tangra, I visit this restaurant and none of the others that are present. Though it is not justified to the rest of the restaurants out there as I have not tried all of them, but somehow I like to be loyal to this one. And again everytime i visit this place I definitely order three of their stuffs:
1) chilli garlic pepper prawn
2) chilli garlic pepper chicken
3) sweet lime soda
 Usually I leave the rest of the course to my sister, and in the due course of time I have tried their schezwan (i hope the spelling is correct) chowmein, gravy chowmein, fried rice, duck-all are pretty decent. And it is here that I tried out honey noodles with ice cream and boy-oh-boy that was a desert I will not easily forget!

P.S: you are definitely going to spend a lot more than 400 bucks (as mentioned in the page) for a full course meal of two people!

Tangra has always been the real Chinatown for me in kolkata. It has a deluge of some extremely good restaurants. and this is one of them. One of my personal favourite restaurants, it has a huge parking lot so travelling with a huge no.of people isnt a problem. D food is equally to watch out for. My personal favourite is the chicken wanton soup and the schezuan chicken. Big boss is otihinally the big boss of Tangra!

Coming to the food.. Big boss serve authentic tangra type chinese all of their dishes are worth to try.. Very tasty.
The place is cheap if you opt for boozing with your friends over good food,the bigger the group the cheaper it gets.

Chinatown  has so many restaurants to choose from that it is difficult to try out each one of them and know which one is the best.Still Big Boss is one of  the best according to me.When you enter the place the first thing that strikes you is huge! The place has an abundance of car parking spaces.The ambiance is average not much to tell about as it is fairly crowded all the time.The place is clean and the management is quite friendly.We ordered Drums of Heaven and Crispy Chicken for starters.The Drums of Heaven were good enough but the Crispy Chicken tasted much better.For the main course we tried out Chicken Haka Noodles,Mixed Fried Rice,Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Chicken.The Noodles were a bit oily for me but he Mixed Fried Rice was really good.The real eye catcher however was the Kung Pao Chicken.It was perfect.The Honey Chicken was a bit sweet and to be truthful spoiled the other dishes.The bill after this was reasonable enough and quite cheap.So if I get another chance to go to Big Boss I would avail it.

On father day 16th June I decided to take my family to big boss since I heard so much about this restaurant in tangra. The place is easily located and the good thing is that you get abundant car park in the restro. It is evident that the restro was a one time tannery which was converted. Deco was good. The service was prompt and I did not have wait for long. 
We ordered the dragon chicken, thai chicken kung pao prawns, mixed chowmein, american chopsuey, mixed rice and mefoon. For starters we had  crispy chicken and drums of heaven or Thai soup and sweet corn soup. the wait time was not long but certainly only a few of the dishes were standard such as kung pao prawns and crispy chicken and thai chicken. But some how I was not impressed with chowmein or the rice or chopsuey certain not classy as golden joy or China pearl. These items definitely needs improvement. The sweet corn soup was badly off and I brought to the notice of the head waiter therefore customers please beware of the soups they serve before gulping down the soup. Certainly one thing worth mentioning is that there is no achinomoto used in the food and that's a very good sign instead spices and masalas imported from Canada have replaced achinomoto and so the heath hazards can be over. was impressed to see the waiters having walkie talkies and coordinating with the reception downstairs.

One of the worst food I had for a long time. Equally bad is the service and etiquette. I was served one third of my order. The reason given was that the shift had changed and the previous waiter did not book the complete order!! The food was bad. Mushroom starters was full of salt. Thai soup was inedible. I had Thai soups in Thailand and also in India. This seemed like made from the leftovers. I complained to the manager. Instead of rectifying the matter he brought the waiters to verify my version which was proved. My evening with parents was ruined. Think Kolkata's people have grown used to bad service.

Went in a group of seven and had a lot of fun. If delicious Chinese food at a reasonable price is your priority then this is the place. Quality and quantity were both equally good. The chicken dishes were delicious and the mixed rice could have been better. One drawback was in the drinks where mocktails and cocktails were not available. But overall one of the best places in Chinatown

In terms of space this place is huge,which is fantastic. However I'm not much fan of the taste. I went there recently with family for dinner and ordered fish finger which wAs great. But the crispy fried chicken was not crispy at all. The rice noodles was tasteless by itself though the Singapore chicken was very good. I would say that the food here is so so and it comes at a reasonable price.

We ever I think to visit China town among all the bar cum restaurants big boss comes with 1st priority. Boozing with friends or you want a family dining you can hop in Bigg Boss.

"Fired crab balls", "Prawn tempura" and beer wow in heaven. Simply great feelings. A great pleasure! "crispy chicken" or "dry chili chicken" also do the magic. These dishes are perfectly prepared neither to salty nor oily a perfect balance of Chinese sauce and sauteed well.Must try!

In the main course "Mixed fried rice", "Maifoon" and "Noodles" are perfectly combined with "fish manchurian" or "Thai chicken in red sauce". 

I have found many restaurants in town where I dare to give "fish" or "sea food" based dishes to order just they dont give stinky smell when delivers, but here In the Big Boss "daar ke aage jit hai" :) You better give orders whether its prawn, fish or crab you will get freshness in those dishes.

And lastly the service is okiesh just because of too much crowd all the time of the year. Do visit once :)

But is worth being in that place with friends or with family. Great environment great food. Thank you big boss.

Before commenting anything on food, let me give you 2 very important points where this restaurant stands out from almost all restaurants in Kolkata. 
1. A huge dining capacity
2. A huge valet assisted in-house parking facility

Coming to the food, this is the authentic tangra type chinese, which means sticky rice, and abundance of star anise in gravy. I like the food and above all the quantity. This place is very cheap if you opt for drinking with good food with a bunch of friends, the bigger the group the cheaper it gets.

Had thai chicken(yummy, must try), thai soup(delicious, must try), chicken cantonisse noodle(okay and could have been better, couldn't beat the taste served by Kimling) and chicken chilly garlic(not that tasty at all, was not soft either, need to work more on this).. The ambience was good and the waiters were polite..

I have been here only once and it might be a tad unfair to pass a judgment based on one solitary experience. But then, if 'first impressions' actually doubles up as 'last impressions', then my only experience at Bigg Boss was 'average' at best.
We strolled in on a lazy winter afternoon on a Sunday this January and quite liked the sprawling parking areas& huge dining spaces. The elaborate glass panes only added to the 'likability' factor as we plonked ourselves on the seats. 
Food wise, nothing tasted radically different from what you are served in the other parts of the town. We had gone for Golden fried prawns, a chicken starter& side dish and separate chow mien & rice dishes. Everything tasted pretty good (anything would when you have had nothing for breakfast) , but there was nothing that blew our senses away. The Golden fried prawns were especially disappointing as they felt pretty dry with a thick blob of batter encircling a tiny piece of shrimp.
When you go all the way to China town to devour on authentic Chinese fare, you couldn't be faulted for expecting something extra or something remarkably better than what you usually get in several other pockets of the city. We may have prematurely set the bar too high for our own liking, but then, China Town has seldom disappointed lovers of Chinese food, right?
As I said earlier, it wouldn't be fair to judge the place after one 'not- so- impressive' outing here, but then if I had to rate the place while strictly adhering to the parameters of fine- dining& my experience, I will be generous enough to go with 3.5.  :-)

Food..decore..ambience..waiters..any factor you name that describes a top notch restaurant...you'll get all..and will be satisfied with all of those. . I have been here twice.. And both times all the food items we ordered were just delectable.. I have never been to mainland china..but my friends who have been there...told me that they were more happy to have lunch in big boss than what they had in mainland china..that too in 1/4 the total expence of mainland china..with same quality of food,ambience and service.. 
Well now coming to what items we ordered..
--> chilli chicken dry,chicken pakoras,chicken shezwan,kungpao(not sure abt the spelling) chicken,chicken lollypop,chilli chicken,chicken fried rice,shezwan chicken fried rice and mixed fried rice. I forgot 2-3 items' name.. In gist.. All these items were just mouth watering scrumptious.. Food was served to us on time.. Hot and fresh.. Waiters are very generous with a big smile on their face all the time.. I will visit this place again and again.. :-)

Chinatown (Tangra) is full of Chinese restaurants, but I simply love Big Boss, because of its service, facilities like huge car park, and of course the food quality. Food is really good and gives a feel of authenticity. Though it has a huge capacity, and is well understandeable how difficult is to manage the overall situation during peak hours, but I must say that the staffs are doing a good job over here. Pricing is also reasonable.

Good place.. Great ambience... Excellent car parking space. But coming to the food it wasn't something great. The dragon prawn starters were great - well cooked n juicy. On the flip side all chicken starters like drums of heaven were below average. Fish items were okay but nothing commendable. Coming to main course both the rice and Cantonese noodles were very good. But again the honey chicken wasn't a really well prepared one. A mutton side dish was very well made and tasted like pork!!!! But it was good. Overall a bang for buck but not the best. Prices are reasonable and drinks are cheap too. Cheers.

The famed Chinatown (Tangra) in Kolkata has too many restaurants to choose from. The only time I have been there, we choose Big Boss mainly because it provided us the much needed parking space! It is spread over a huge area, and not one of those cramped up food joints. I had heard a lot about the authentic Chinese dishes here, and so we tried out quite a few of them - which turned out to be quite nice! The sea-food platter and the crab starter items were particularly delicious, and the quantity was more than adequate (we ended up packing stuffs).

However, the service was not as good as expected, and we literally had to get up and look for people to attend our table. In spite of that, I would recommend this place if you are in this part of the city and want to have authentic Chinese food!

I have been to Kolkata's famed Chinatown earlier and wanted to go there again. Even though Chinese food is easily available in Kolkata, you need to head to Chinatown for more authentic version of it. I had come to Big Boss yesterday with a friend for some good food and drinks. We had ordered chili garlic pepper chicken, fried prawn balls, prawn chips and peanut masala (had a tough time finding the peanuts in the dish) besides our drinks (which is the same everywhere). The food items are reasonably priced and the restaurant is spread over a large area and even though it got congested with families as the evening peaked it was a nice experience to be there. We spent around 4 hours which is a record for me at any restaurant. It would have been better had one of the persons serving us was more polite. Also, someone spilled water on the floor but it wasn't cleaned quick enough and my friend who was returning from the washroom slipped and hurt herself. I understand the vagaries of managing huge crowds at a very popular restaurant but these are basics beside good food and drinks. Overall it was a memorable evening. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and bring my family in the near future.

Had visited this place after reading a number of good reviews about it. Its just 2 mins away from beijing rest in tangra. The place is huge where one wont face any parking problems. We were directed towards the 2nd floor for our lunch sitting. My friends were in a mood to eat vegetarian due to some pujas going on. So our menu comprised of only veg items.. 
veg tom yum soup: it was a medium spicy soup with loads of ginger. The flavor was nice only problem was the ginger slices were too much and could not be gulped in because of the fiber in it.
Crispy chilli babycorn. It came in 10 mins and it was not crispy with the baby-corn soaked in oil.
veg szechuan fried rice. The fried was orangish in color symbolizing it to be szechaun but it was nt at all spicy.. it seemed like veg fried rice in orange color.
Manchurian button mushroom: this was a decent dish but not very impressive it was just mushroom battered fried in chilli chicken gravy. Overall the experience was just average. The cost was reasonable.. Golden joy has better flavors in that area. Not sure how the non veg dishes fair but veg was truly disappointing.....

Go for the Prawn Tanpooras and the Singaporean Chicken ! 
Big Boss has also a very Big Plus - it has a vast parking space (and now a multi-tiered parking) to accommodate almost everyone.

Very reasonable. For around 16 people the cost came up to around Rs. 6700/- including soup. We have gone for common dishes like crispy chicken, hot garlic chicken, Kungfao chicken (can't recall the exact name), garlic fish, Fried Rice, Hakka Noodles ad so on. All the dishes were Ok to good. You have ample parking place and separate area for family.

In 2012, my birthday was celebrated in Big Boss, and for 7 people eating and drinking their hearts out, the bill was extremely reasonable. I have been a regular here since 2009, and have has school reunions celebrated here. The management is friendly and treat regulars with a lot of love and respect - the same cannot be said about the people who aren't regulars. My friends have complained about the lack of attention of the servers. That said, I love the spring chicken, crispy chilli baby corn, thread chicken and chilli garlic pepper chicken here - all of them starters and go perfectly with most drinks. As far as main course goes, I am not much of a fan of their chow mien, but they do make a decent chilli garlic noodles, and also serve up a pretty decent garlic chicken.

One of the better restaurants in China Town. They have separate arena for Family. The parking area is the best on China Town (within the compound), valet parking available as well.
Now, regarding the dining area its huge and you have all sorts of tables from table for 2 to table for 20. This actually adds to the commotion as too many people are seated at any point of time. They have two dining areas for family (one in new and the other in old building).
Getting a place is very difficult on weekends. They accept pre booking but only if you agree to reach before 7:30.
Regarding the food, its cheap and of good quality. All cooked fresh. The waiter even takes care to see that you have not ordered excess. If excess, they're happy to pack it for you.
Among delicacies, the crispy chicken, crispy baby corn, hot garlic chicken are mentionable. The quantity is good, one plate in main course like rice/chowmein enough for two.
Recommended for people who love good food at cheap price, not recommended for people who desire for a peaceful dinner, as the place is somewhat chaotic.

The first thing that strikes one is the size and area of the restaurant.... it really is big. There is ample parking space and the dining area is huge and well laid out. The staff is well mannered and attentive and the location is not too deep inside Tangra that it takes to long to reach or exit.

The food is good, wholesome, spicy and tasty to the core. The Tangra type Dry Chilly Chicken is a hit and goes down very well with a chilled beer on a sultry evening. The rice and noodles and light and tasty. The Wanton Soup is good and gives a nice warm feeling. Overall, a good dining experience. Recommended for large groups, particularly if you have visitors from outside and want them to experience Tangra- the oldest China town in India.

The USP of Big Boss is it's parking space within their own premises. The food is tasty and tastes but not authentic Chinese. They lack fusion foods in the menu which is more of a convention than exotic. More of a place to have liquor at economy  accompanied by some spicy Chinese snacks.

Heard a lot about this establishment and first time visited here. First thing which will catch your attention is it's huge parking space they have and the only one in Chinatown. They have a huge dining area but the moment you enter will notice one thing which is lethargic waiters.
They takes ages to give a table, get menu card for you, serve you water and doesn't know how to communicate with customers.
Now coming to food. Well Chinatown restaurants are known for their value for money and Big Boss is no exception. Food quantity is very good, quality is acceptable, taste keeps you busy yet light on your wallet. After ordering starters, soups, main & side dishes along with deserts our bill was around INR 3300 for 8 adults. Pretty cheap huh? But saying so you have to be mentally prepared with the waiting time to get your order on table.
Few things one has to be aware of before paying a visit to Chinatown area. They have clumsiest lanes, mad traffic, foul smell in air from leather factories. I guess this establishment can't do much about this.
If the management improve their service and train their waiters how to keep up with customer expectations then this one you should look for. I am rating them strictly on my overall experience inside the property and their horrendous service takes away couple of stars.

Had been to this restaurant twice with office collegues on both the occasions. This place guarantees you authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices with reasonable alcohol prices. We were around 10 people and the total bill that was charged was around Rs. 9000 including alcohol which is great. About the food, the starters like the prawn and the chicken items were really awesome. The other plus point is the huge parking space in the entire building compound apart from the reasonable alcohol prices. The minus point is the service which could be, more often than not, quite slow. All in all, a good value for money. About the alcohol, even though they provide 375 ml bottles, they are charged per peg. Still it works out to be very reasonable.

Writing a review in zomato after a long gap , so please excuse if I don't write like the same way as before . :) 
Anyway , I should have reviewed this restaurant much earlier , as I have been to the Big Boss quite a few times on different types of occasions . First time I went there I think was during a Durga Puja much earlier , but I do not have much recollection of that . But recently first time I went was just after my wedding when I had to treat a a band of 31 guys - mainly my relatives. We reached around 8 o clock i think, and we still got a place to seat right away . This is simply owing to the fact the huge area covered by the Big Boss restaurant . Since then i have been there 3-4 more times, and often when we do not want to wait any time - we think of going here . 
Coming to the food part - they serve good Chinese items - in good quantity . Yes, there are places which serve even more , but that is rare . Taste wise , I would say i like their style - it is not exquisite ,but good . I do like the prawn papad they serve among other things . 
One of the reasons people often go to Tangra is for drinking alcohol - and these people do make it advantageous . You are allowed to order for a 375 bottle , which makes it cheaper than per peg count . 
The car parking space is also helpful . Regarding the waiters and managers - i might say ,sometimes they can be a little more courteous , but then I have not had a major issue till now here .

My favourite restaurant in China Town.

The food is very good. Dishes like Golden Fried Prawn, Spring Chicken are delicious.

The ambience is very good and open but cozy, and space is the best in the vicinity.

Not costly at all.

The food is a bit better in Beijing, but you will get liquor in bottles only in Big Boss. And that becomes really cheap compared to pegs.

been here with frnds. what would I call it is a place you can drink ,chat,laugh and also have great food.if you wanna visit China in Kolkata,this is the place.
cheapest drink I ever had . We took antiquity blue 375ml bottle which was charged around 900.Now where would u find a place where you could buy bottle rather than pegs.60ml was 220 so imagine how much we saved . 
Heaven for people who wanna booze. Lol...
now coming to ambience its good with decent people out there.
Food here is awesome ,at least the dishes which we had.
Must try is golden fried prawn,crispy fish,mefu .

1st time with my school friends in my last visit to Kolkata. It‚Äôs a big big place and spacious. Tables are not cluttered. It was weekend night but there was enough seats. They have there own huge parking space. The ambiance is nice but the Chinese decor was missing.

We were all men so the waiter guided us to a separate side (in last part of the restaurant) for sitting. Few groups (all male) were soughting and cracking jokes loudly, which were enough to spoil the atmosphere.

The food was excellent and pretty reasonably priced as well. Rs.3300/- for 6 person with booze. The service was very prompt.

Big Boss, only the name is big rest all is worthless. Horrible food and very very rude staff (especially the manager Mr. William). Come what may guys please stay away from the restaurant. I have been a regular to almost most of the restaurants in Tangra but my first visit to Big Boss was as horrible as it could get. They are bringing disrepute to an otherwise awesome place like Tangra. Foodwise Kimfa, Kafluk, Beijing, Golden Joy, Kimling are a gr8 option for some mouthwatering food.

I used to visit  this place quite often , particulary  on the weekends as I used to freak out on the starters, particularly their Crispy Fried Fish(dont forget to ask the green chutney...normally prepared & served in the evenings) , Golden Fried Jumbo Prawns & Schezwan Crabs (it's  seasonal .......I have been disappointed quite a few times due to non-availibility).They are just mind boggling. It is wise  to visit during the day time as the crowd is less.On week ends & during festive season , they open up  the new wing,which is adjacent to the main building & ideal  for  families .It also has a reserved section with a separator for private parties.The restaurant is spacious, good seating arrangement  & also  has a bar .One can simply drive upto the restaurant and park the car on the 1st Floor.There is ample choice in the menu  & since  I am fond of spicy food , I have a lot of choice as far as prawn  &  chicken is concerned.The portion is quite generous & one has the option of ordering either small( 07 pieces)/big( 12 pieces) portions.The average food bill with a choice of 3 Non-Veg starters & 3 course non-veg meal without drinks would work out around 2000/- plus taxes for a small family.

Of late however I found that the preparations were not as good as before , perhaps due to the change of hands in the kitchen! Nevertheless one should definitely pay a visit & try out on their own!You cannot miss out the Aquarium just at the entrance of the old but renovated wing!

This is pretty big restaurant on Tangra Road. The USP of this place is the big parking space within their own premises. The food is average and tastes more Indian than Chinese. The menu is also absolutely standard and the choice of exotic items in the menu is limited. Its a good place to visit for tipplers for some cheap liquor accompanied by some spicy Chinese Indian snacks . Smokers can enjoy a smoke on the adjoining big terrace they have but beware if the entire group is leaving the table, you will have to submit your mobile phone or credit card to the waiter.

Location (Rating - 5):
Big Boss is very easy to find. No complains about the location. The parking area is more than enough to house all customer cars. Actually it might also house cars from the customers of other restaurants as well.

Ambiance (Rating - 4):
The ambiance here is good. A mixture of modern and traditional chinese decor makes it look very good. I like a restaurant which does not have very bright or very dim light and the lighting at Big Boss is really good. You can find all the spices in your dish and not want to wear shades...LOL

Service (Rating - 4):
The waiters and stewards are polite and the overall service is quite good. You won't have any complains regarding the staff and service thats for sure.

Food (Rating - 1):
Big Boss the biggest joint in China Town I was expecting Big Boss to be the leader in quality of its food but I was rather surprised. The worst food that I have ate. The rice was over cooked and watery. The chicken also tasted like raw and without spices. The noodles were good compared to the rice but not as a chinese dish should be. The prawn is good but quite regular. Honestly food served at Big Boss was worse than a local stall selling chinese food in Calcutta. A humble request to Big Boss, without any offence, change the chef...!!!

Price (Rating - 3):
Well peoples I was really disappointed with the food and for the food that I had at Big Boss I don't like to pay what was charged. Generally the prices are good if you are served good food.

Was disappointed on my last visit. Went there for lunch at around 1 pm. Twice cooked pork was so hard and chewy. Crab claws was over battered. Tried to get attention of the captain or manager that was on the floor but both are too busy chit chatting. Two guys wearing a jacket was there on duty but none came to check if the food was good or not....

The place is really spacious and well decorated. We ordered Drums of Heaven, Mongolian Chicken , Mixed Fried Rice , Mixed Meifoon, Kung-pao Chicken and Hot Garlic Fish. The service was really fast. Quantity of food was good. Coming to the food taste, the Mongolian Chicken was really delicious and so was the Kung-pao Chicken. But the mixed Meifoon chow was bland. It lacked seasoning and was the worst dish of the day. But overall it was pocket friendly and had a fun time.

I really do not know why someone should come here for a drink when the din is excruciating, instead Shaw bar would have provided the same experience for a much little pocket pinch. The food is alright but almost all other eateries a few paces inside China town provides the same for the same price, albeit with larger portions. This place is overhyped at its best and the people visiting here are mere glory hunters who value status over food. Period. You won't lose anything if you don't visit this. Instead try out a few smaller eateries in the interior. Rest assured you will not be disappointed.

it is undoubtedly one of the famed restros in china town.but i found nothing outstanding here,other than their huge establishment with two separate double storied buildings,the food is very much overpriced,as per the quantity and the taste.the main courses were priced 100 bucks more than the normal rates at other places beside.
i had been there with my bf,for dinner on maha-oshtomi,durga puja 2012.almost all the places were overcrowded in tangra,yet we luckily managed a table for two,after a short que.
our orders chicken sweet corn soup,crispy fried chicken,thumbs up 300 ml,non veg noodles and chicken manchurian were all very well made and tasted yummy,that left us undisappointed inspite of the puja rush.
Our next visits were also equally good . Overall my favourite place for reasonable booze and food.

great place to hang out with friends and have a drink or two with chinese food. you can buy 375ml bottles of your favorite drink and that is economical. food is good and tasty. however, the amount per plate is not adequate. stuffs are not very friendly, they delay a lot in listening to your order. fish fingers and drums of heaven were good among starters.
they have a big parking lot which is also nice.

The most elite restaurant in China Town that offers valet parking and a very cosy ambience. Probably the most widespread restaurant in all of China Town,this place serves amazing Chinese fare. I liked the enormous shark fish at the entrance and their round table seating arrangement. The food of course is out of the world. I just loved their prawn gold coins. and i love their rice noodles as well. whatever you order from the menu will surely taste brilliant! This is the ultimate restaurant in China Town. must try for everyone!

Located in the heart of china town with one of the biggest properties (if not the biggest), Big Boss offers you one thing best... Parking. Food is so called chinese, with a lot of indo influences. This is a place where you can treat your friends or your extended family for a lot less. Crowd is is very load and often drunk, so please rule out an quiet dinner with that someone special. Come wih your rowdy buddies and the place suddenly turns into heaven.

This is a huge restaurant in the famous china town area with ample of car parking facility. That gives a biggest benefit in this region where you don't feel to park the car on the narrow road and stay worried or ask your lady to walk in the dark after parking far off from the restaurant. You can drive till the door step rather. My Chinese fiends told me that authentic Chinese cooking is either grilled or boiled and there is no place for deep fry. Secondly the taste is derived from the sauce which is poured and not through masala like in Indian foods. But i am sure if any of the Chinese joint in India follows these culinary formula then clientele will be limited.
I can happily share with the readers that Big Boss in Tangra serves Chinese foods with deep fry and if needed the spicy chutney so much used for fries in Punjabi cuisine is available on asking. Whether i tried chilly chicken or golden fried prawn or other fry chicken there is a distinct taste of cross between Chinese and Punjabi.  Let me tell you that this is one of the few joints which offers full plate,half plate and quarter plate. So there is no problem one can sample many dishes without wasting.

Have tried their prawn chips,chicken fried rice,pepper chicken,Chicken soup,manchurian chicken,chilly chicken,garlic chicken and hakka.
But my favourite is their flavorful boneless dry Korean sticks.Not many chinese restaurants offer that.Its crisp,perfectly roasted and has a long and lingering aftertaste.

So,give your palate a treat and definitely try out the Korean sticks here!

Big Boss as the name suggests is a very big restaurant amidst smaller eateries around China Town aka Tangra. Parking is always easily available. Valet is available as well which is a big plus.

Now coming to the restaurant, the ambience is decent. Among the food items, Crispy Chilly Potato stole the show. Thai soup was tasty. The rice and noodles are good to taste here although I would opt for the noodles. Chopsuey is decent. The chicken items are good. Overall its a good package with reasonable pricing considering the huge quantity they serve.

3.5 stars from me for Big Boss.

Tangra and Chinese...inseparable like fire and smoke... Bigg Boss, as the name suggests, is not really the topper in the chinese infested Tangra. The food is good, parking space is easily available (both for your car and YOU in the restaurant :) ) Prices are OK (there are cheaper options nearby with same food quality). I felt the food was too oily than usual.

For those parking is a big problem and think twice before visiting some of the renowned restaurant for lack of parking space, Big Boss is the place to go :) Probably the largest area for a restaurant. 

Big Boss has 3 dimension for me.. first being the place to have a few beer and crispy chicken - I rank it 99/100 

2nd Dimension is the place to take your family out. I wonder why there are restaurants with two separate places for family and people without family. This is really frustrating for people who does not have a family. 

3rd Dimension - the new revamped Big Boss... well it is too huge :)

More than anything about the food. My favorite dish the duck meat has definitely deteriorated which is a painful acceptance for a duck lover. Other dishes are well prepared. I must suggest the Chicken with Vegetable Soup here. This is really a great preparation of Big Boss. While the management is too occupied in decorating the place and make it bigger and bigger, I would like them to give more importance in the quality of food and it's price. Both were amazing around 5 years back.

even there are many restaurants in tangra which are pretty cheap in terms of their prices and tend to serve much good food than big boss does!
though i went there during the pujas and the place was jam packed hence ignorant behaviour from the staffs is quite expected
yet somehow i don't quite appreciate rude service
one of their staff who was responsible for our service was highly rude.
however coming down to the food which was pretty normal, nothing extra ordinary compared to other restaurants of tangra that i have been to
the items are overpriced when the quantity is considered because its not quite filling when you are hungry
the crispy chicken tasted like fish fry and to be honest at first i thought it to be fish and they served it in a dish which had drops of oil scattered all over the plate!
the schezwan chicken is a good dish. 
a meal for two is definitely not 400 approx. its 700+ excluding drinks.
overall i was quite disappointed with this place. may be the time wasn't good to visit this place. whatever it was i would favourite other restaurants in tangra which continue to serve quality and quantity food with reasonable price

Look, tangra has better restaurants in terms of flavor, but this is a whole package for people who want to have a little bit of fine dining experience in Tangra. 

The one thing I'll always remember about Big Boss is its crispy chickens. When I started eating them, I couldn't stop myself. This is a place to eat chinese food only, you don't go to tangra to have north Indian food, no Sir! 

This place also offers a great parking space that is a plus on my book!

Big boss is a very nice place for having chinese dishes and other cuisines too. I mostly eat chinese whenever i visit there but its location is very far. Interior design is fine and quality of food is tasty and quantity is also okay. The most which i like is the prawn preparations but once when i had been there the quality of prawn was poor but it did not continue. Its location only makes inconvenient to me for visiting there. Service is also well-mannered. Suggestion goes to people for having food here especially chinese.I would rate 4 stars for it.

Big boss is definitely my most favourite place in Tangra.. The ambiance is very good. The staff is very good. But above all of these is the excellent food.  Starting from the soup to the main course the food is very good in both taste and quantity. Special mention to the dry schezwan chicken, chilli garlic prawns, and duck roast in the starter. The cantoneese chowmein is also wonderful , specially for those who avoid very spicy food. Also the fact that it sells liquor in bottles makes an added advantage. It is not very costly. On the whole it is one of my preferred place for a party.

Had been here recently, what i really like abt this place to begin with is .. tonnes of parking space, this by far the only restaurant where i hav had meefood and liked it. their range of starters are really nice and nice place to take a group and friends and chill out. another thing worth mentioning, the green chili sauce they serve on the table is mind blowing... 

over all , a nice place

I like this place because of its huge dining place. Sometimes very noisy because of crowd specially sat and sun evenings. Serve good Chinese food with drinks.

Fried Thai Chicken and Fish both are quite good, parking area is quite big, so I never have to search for parking area likewise I always need to find in Park Street. Smooking zone is at hand... North India dishes are not recommended here. Always go for Chinesse and Thai.

The only thing I like about this place is the ample car parking. Thats it. There are ample places in Tangra offering better food and better ambiance. The entire atmosphere is fairly impersonal, with the aluminum furniture giving the place a cold feel as soon as you enter. The crowd isn't great either...sometimes bordering on cheap not a place I'd like to take my wife and kid. Sorry.

Great ambiance +great food. Only problem is you would never get an empty table. Min waiting time = 45 mins. But is is worth the wait!!!
