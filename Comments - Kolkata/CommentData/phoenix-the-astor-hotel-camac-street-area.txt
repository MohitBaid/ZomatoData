From Plush to Phoenix in the heart of the city, Theatre Road..
Its all about a calm place with soft music.. Dim lights and spacious place.Â 
Food is good and the staff's are helpful to suggest you the best out of the menu..Â 

It's a must visit place to spend time with your dear one..Â 

Do go and visit.

Wanted to give 0 stars but there is no option of it so having no choice had to give 1.the reason is rude behaviour of staff they just keep saying that u are at the 7 star pub before asking for discount on a bill of rs 15000 everyone ask after billing so I don't know what's the point to say u r not at dhaba or 2 star pub 7 star dude even staffs working in dhaba behaves far better than u .They don't even know how to talk to their customers and after asking for discount their staff promised that they will give a complimentary hookah but after we paid the bill the staff ran out of the premises a man of words staff he is I must say and other staff also did not help us and instead of finding him or fulfilling their commitments they said do whatever u want to do and yaa don't call it a 7 star pub hahaha even 2 star pub staffs at  behave better than u atleast they are man of words not like u who after promising cannot give a complimentary hookah

Oh waow So finaly we have 7 star night club at theatre road??? ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ F*** that bloody cheap bar. Never visited such a worst 3rd class bar ever in my life. Bloody members of club don't know how to treat with people. When I asked to give us seat so we can relax and order the bloody crew said 'Night club me kon bethta hai we don't have seat' One said if you want seat then U shoud have reservations. Is it? Then why fkng they charged us? Its just for come and stand over there to see the bloody ugly face of members only? Better spending such huge amount there i would prefer to go to a simple restaurant who give better service and have good arrangement than this.

The people dont even deserve a 0 star but having no other options left i am giving 1 star with all the bad respect. U can't find such a redicuolus 7 star bar as high fi as they think(Phoenix). Charges was like I am not in theatre road but I am in Canaught place they charged 150 for coal change, 850 for beer which originally priced at 30 and 300 respectively with no serving only bottle for beer. Behaviour of the people was worst than a people like local dhaba even dhaba do well behaviour with us. Dont know who the hell was crew who promised us to give a complimentary hookah and after making payment he ran away even from the Phoenix premises and other crew was just told us that whatever u can do u do we will never give you the complimentary.This was the last visit of ours in such a horrible place. Highly not recommended. Please don't go and waste your money and time. ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡

I had been to this place for an event hosted here. This place has a large dance floor and the overall ambience is averagely good. Nothing in this place was outstanding compared to the other newly opened pubs in the city. Food was again averagely good when it comes to the taste.

Wat a sham of a nightspot #PhoenixBar/Club has bcom @theastorkolkata. Touted to raise the bar of clubbing experience in kolkata its now like one of those places who change their name and expect people won't notice. Beating the drums over some boring hangingÂ  LEDs (oh! Did you know! They're colour changing!!!), #PhoenixBar/Club is a sad replica of the once favourite Plush. This shows in the 15-20 people walking around inside aimlessly on a Friday nite, a jaded dj practising for his other gig complemented with equally disinterested bartenders, an usher who doesn't know the ifs from the butts. Drink serve in cocktail when enquired with the server was confirmed as 60 ml which the absent minded bartender maybe forgot and topped up when questioned. Maybe its their new normal of being healthily interactive with customers where you need to question them to get the right portion. Food comes out with side mentioned in menu missing on plate (as simple as mashed potato) and again the healthy interactive communication with server results in the chef sending a plate of mashed potato separately (well its a DIY of steak on the bed of mash). #Deck88 no better where they try to pass up cornered pizza base as pita and when pointed out the chef maybe is too embarrassed to face the diners meekly sends out another plate of similar instead of acknowledging that they may hav run out of pita. Maybe our expectation was too high from the wall street return with manhattan clubbing experience but as we all know wall street has its fair share of lehman brothers and enron too!

Astor hotel - theatre road , next to nightangle hospital.
Location - very apt and prime
Ambience - A1
Earlier this place was plush but now it has been changed to phoenix, & I must say, the change was for good.
Amazing experience with upper class service.
Food - chilli garlic noodles - pure love
Hookah was too good too.
I would say this place deserves a must visit tag.

The newly opened "Phoenix Bar/ Club" at the The Astor Hotel is just few months old and it's already killing the scene with so many highlighting features and innovative cocktails!

UNIQUENESS:
For the first time in the city, this place is brightened with the presence of "Madrix LED Lighting" that configures 50,000 effects in sync with music. Being designed on brick and wood with an industrial ceiling, Phoenix is set to become the perfect joint for live performances with talented line up of musicians and bands.

We tried:-
DRINKS:
1. Lavender Margarita: Strong essence but perfectly balanced.
2. Watermelon Mojito: Exotic and fruity mix
3. A bucket full of happiness which I'd like to call "Goa": You just have to try this. No words. Just. Try. This.

FOOD:
4. Lasuni Fish Kebab: Beautifully marinated tender fish, simply finger-licking
5. Greek Sampler Platter: A platter full of surprises! Totally in love with the various experimentation gone wild and perfect! 
6. Kosha Mangsho Sliders: Kosha Mangsho in handy sliders, who doesn't love grabbing a quick bite of Bangaliana while grooving to your favorite beat?

My personal favourite was the Bucket! And the Lasuni Fish Kebab. 

The venue has a lot of exciting offers and loads of things in store. Highly recommended for a good time with family and friends. 
All the best, Phoenix Bar/Club! Can't wait to visit again.

We were absolutely delighted to visit Phoenix and it was beautiful. Plush was always a personal favourite and I am sure Phoenix will follow in its place.
The interiors are absolutely gorgeous and the thought that must have gone into its creation quite apparent.The food we had that day specially the Tawa Mutton Bhuna , KungPao Prawn with Fried Rice and  Reshmi Kebabs were delicious and I look forward to my next visit already. Fantastic Vibe, Fabulous Music and Stunning Interiors .... its certainly ready to take the City of Joy by Storm ! Highly recommended.

Phoenix has risen from the ashes of Plush - and how! The place has gone for a complete makeover and is looking more spacious and more luxurious.

Pros:
Food and Drinks are great. We ordered Rock Chilli Shrimps, Sausages wrapped in bacon, fish fingers and a Mezze pita platter with our beverages. Quality of the food is indeed very good!

Cons: 
Even though it was a Saturday night, the place was short staffed. Service was a definite problem. Hope they improve on that front soon.
