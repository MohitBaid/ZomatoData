After a long time had such tasty momos in North Kolkata. Manchurian was also very good, both taste wise and quantity wise. The price is also reasonable.

Howdy mate, I ate my full and wanted to have a midnight munch and thought of ordering crispy chicken by tasty taste and oh! Boy I was satisfied with the delivery as it came with spoon and napkin and it was mildly hot too... fun part is it was delivered well before time... now about the dish it was crispy, was a bit spicy and quantity wise ok, not a lot nor was it less but I found it less juicy but nevertheless in north Kolkata this is what outmost you can get at this time of night... happy overall but wanted my crispy chicken a bit juicy and as an Indian a bit more quantity wise... will be back telling you another tasty story of another restaurant sometime soon...

Amazing Momos but need improvement on the Lollipop. They are made more like chilly chicken than Lollipop.

Ordered chicken momo and chilli chicken and the former tasted quite good while Chilli chicken was a bit undercooked. I would not mind ordering for a plate of chicken Momo from this place again. The price factor is also quite surprising given the not so bad quality of taste and quantity.

Location: Kaikhali ghosh para.
Item: Chicken momo.
Description: This place has become my go to place for my evening snack. I always order steamed chicken momo. The price for 1 plate steamed chicken momo is ₹60.00/- and the price for half plate steamed chicken momo is ₹30.00/-. In full plate there will be 8 and in half plate there will be 4 pieces of momos. They serve complimentary soup and sauce with it. The soup is normal clear veg soup and the sauce is red chilli sauce. The momos are quite good in taste.

Have been to this place several times, but tried only steamed momo. Taste is good. They also give clear soup with every plate of momo. Reasonable price. The only negative point is there seating arrangement. They don't have enough tables and chairs, also they make you seat under open air. Otherwise it  deserves a 4* rating.
