Tasty sumptuous food well within the range of our pockets.
I would recommend fried wantons, fried rice , ginger chicken, Manchurian chicken from here.
P.S. one plate of fried rice is quite enough for two here. üôÇ
Happy eating

It was December and I felt like eating outside. But my budget was too low. Rs.300 for 2 people. Then Pou Hing came to my rescue. 
The place is not very fancy and it's not a fine dining. But, the quality and quantity makes up for it. We ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Large Chilly Chicken. The rice was full of shrimps,chicken egg. The taste was good. The bill was only 290 RS. I would recommend it to anyone and if you have low budget and still u crave Chinese , then it's a must visit.
N.B.-Although located in Terreti bazaar, they don't serve pork.

Pocket Friendly and good food. Thats how i would define Poh Hing. However, if you are looking for a comfy lunch or dinner in a plush AC setting, this place is not for you. However, it offers yum food at an extremely reasonable rate if good food is all you care about in a basic non AC setting. It caters mainly to the office goers since its located conviniently in Terretti Bazar, Dalhousie. I have been there multiple times during lunch hours and my personal favs include Sweet Corn Chicken soup, Mixed Fried Rice and Dry Chilly Chicken. The Dry Chilly is highly recommended. I did not like their much hyped Drinking Chicken though, its too spicy for my palate. Serving portion is good too. One rice and side dish can easily feed two hungry souls. If you have a taste for chinese food, you can give it a shot!

The word PERFECT is clearly defined by this small eatery. If you are looking for lip smacking chinese food, do visit this place. Decoration wise, it seems to be like a mediocre college canteen. But the food offered is just awesome. No doubt pocket friendly. Must visit for college goers and chinese foodie.

It is exactly like the simple local restro type.But the food taste is exactly oh-so perfect.They serve authentic Chinese food with a generous amount.A single plate of rice or noodles is sufficient for two.I think students and who love Chinese should visit this place once,ignoring the decor.

After reading the reviews of this restaurant from zomato, I went to this eatery. The place to very clean and calm, though they don't have AC but that doesn't matter for me. I ordered drinking wings in the starters. The guy said it will take little more time to prepare this and I was ok with that, after 10-12 mins my order arrived. It was just amazing, the aroma and the taste was very well identified. In the main course I ordered only Pou Hing special fried rice . Let me tell you it was one of the best fried rice I have ever had, each and every component was just perfect. I need to mention here that the staffs were very well behaved. To sum up it's a pocket friendly but the best restaurant of its kind. If you are a Chinese food lover, then you should give it a try for once at least.

Though the location  of the eatery was quite tricky, but the food was beyond tasty.. we had Chicken volcano, chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian.. the quantity of the rice was huge.. enough for 2 person.. 
The CHICKEN VOLCANO demands a special mention here.. it was delicious..a bit spicy,with a smokey flavour... Loved it thoroughly...

A medium sized restaurant tucked away in a corner across Poddar Court! Popular for takeaways & office orders. I love their fried wantons. I can actually have it every single day. Their chicken volcano is quite delicious actually. Their noodles are just average but the side dishes are good. Quite light on pocket & if u happen to be in a rush & AC ain't an issue, then you should definitely not miss this place if happen to be around Central metro station.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time. Finally got a chance to visit this place, located behind the Poddar court, this is surely a must try chinese outlet for all the chinese food enthusiasts.coming to the main part, the food, we ordered drinking wings, mixed fried rice and chicken manchurian. Well drinking wings is currently one of the dish I am in love with, the aroma of wine is a pure bliss for any food fanatic, it's a must try. Mixed fried rice and chicken manchurian was also good in quality. quantity was huge, enough for two people. Had a great experience, will visit again for sure.

A very pocket friendly chinese eatery at tiretta bazaar just beside the poddar court. Been there with my friends to have some good chinese. They took order & served really quick. We had mixed hakka noodles, chicken fried rice & chicken manchurian. All the items were just amazing!! & about their quantity they serve really big portions in one plate. Noodles were less oily & quiet light. Rice was really good & I love their Manchurian‚ù§‚ù§ they gives 8 succulent soft pieces of chicken which is just enough for two person with normal appetite. Totally loved their food & looking forward to visit againüòäüòä

Visited this place after going through some rave reviews in Zomato but was hugely disappointed . 
The place is located behind the Poddar Court Building & may be a little tricky to find . Take help of Maps of Zomato or take the first right lane after Poddar Court & walk towards Sun Yet Sen Street & the joint will be on your right side .
The area is dirty but that would not have been an issue had the food itself was lipsmacking. 
The inside of the place is more or less clean with basic table & chairs for sitting . The Staffs were not properly dressed & the whole place was full of smell of fried items ( smell of old oil was overpowering ). We decided to try their much talked about Drinking Chicken first . 
Drinking Chicken : The name " drinking " must have come from the use of wine in the dish . I am non-alcoholic but have tasted wine dipped / marinated /burnt items on a number of occasions . The quality of wine in this particular dish was cheap . It was kind of a deep fried chicken starter available in roadside eateries . It contained 8 pieces of chicken & the portion is quite big but tastewise very ordinary . The coating of the chicken was ordinary too .
One person was having Hakka Noodles in the the nearby table & the quantity was simply huge . 
Disappointed with the starter we left the place without having any further item . 
The water tap in the wash basin was not working & they had placed a bucket & mug for use ( another low point ).
Price is very much on the lower side .
The place is definitely not suitable for a family outing .
If quantity & price is the detemining factor then it's a good place but if quality food is the deciding factor then look elsewhere . 
The rating points is on account of quantity & price only .

This place goes real easy on pocket and quench your thirst for chinese. Do not expect some great ambience or decor here. Go just for the food. We ordered sweet corn chicken soup which was good. The noodles and fried rice were great too. 2 plates were enough for 3 people. The drums of heaven was a disappointment though! It was extremely spicy and totally red. But overall, good!

This place is located on the backside of the Poddar Court Building. It's a 2-3 min walk from Central Metro Station. Now the inside looks a bit shabby and there's no decor as such, but their food is gonna blow your mind. Yes!! Even I couldn't believe it when I first entered this place. 
So me and my friend ordered a Mixed fried rice, one half Chicken Mushroom Babycorn for sides and their very " popular" Drinking wings. The drinking wings was cooked in wine and you could feel the taste of burning wine in every bite. The mixed fried rice was out of the world. It had so many bits of chicken and prawn in it and the quantity was great. The chicken mushroom Babycorn was very juicy and I really loved the taste of it. Overall, they serve one of the best Chinese food in Kolkata. Period. 

One might not visit this place for the ambience and decor. But hey, if you are a fan of true Chinese( not Indo-Chinese ) food, then you should definitely visit this place. This is a very underrated restaurant but they serve authentic Chinese food at a reasonable price. Very reasonable. I, highly recommend this place to every foodie and non-foodie out there.

There are 3 kinds of eateries:
1. Looks good, serves good.
2. Looks good, serves bad
3. Looks bad, serves good.
Pou Hing falls under the third category.

It's quite far from where I stay, and I seldom visit that part of the city.
It was one such rare afternoon, that we(me and my husband) were near Lal Bazar for some work and looking for some lunch option nearby. Zomato guided us to Pou Hing. It took about 15 minutes walk and search to locate the place from Lal bazar which is only 2 minutes away.
And when we reached, we were a little intimidated by the surroundings. The
 lane serves as a fish and raw meat market in the morning(it's the same lane that is famous for morning Chinese breakfast). And this was very much visible from the state of the lane. 
Once inside, it did not feel that bad. There was a clean table, working ceiling fan, and shade to calm us down. Food was served rather fast. I had chicken mushroom soup which had amazing broth and really fresh slices of button mushrooms. I finished the entire portion all my myself. I have a thing for clear thin soups :-).
We had some noodles that was again good, but the star of the show was chicken volcano. Tasty, super spicy, succulent chunks of chicken covered in egg, that needed a bottle of thumsup‚Äã to wash the heat.
The bill was around 400 for all this goodness.

If you want to have indian chinese, don't want to spend a fortune, not bothered about the ambience stuff, definitely visit Pou Hing. Your tastebuds will be thankful to you.

Writing after a long time, we came upon Pou Hing quite by accident actually. We were looking for another popular eatery in the vicinity and seeing it closed decided to investigate further and landed up at this place. My friend was pretty skeptic but we decided to give it a go nonetheless.¬†

The place is airy and is just big room with a couple of tables thrown in. The walls are mustard yellow and there is a Cross hanging from one wall. Pretty non descriptive if ¬†one like snazzy places, but it has its charm. Unsure if the place was operational or not, we were soon greeted by a Chinese man who turned out to be a customer himself. The young man at the counter soon came up to our table for our orders.

Like most Chinese eateries, the menu is extensive, something which both my friend and I discussed as being perhaps unnecessary, but then again, it seems to be the prevalent style.

We ordered the chicken wanton soup at first, sure that we will order more after the soup. One bowl of chicken wanton soup is more than enough as a meal for two! delicate chicken wantons steamed in the broth accompanied by egg noodles, greens and diced chicken greeted us with a wonderful aroma! after the customary soy we tasted heaven. The broth is light and aromatic, the chicken boiled to perfection. The greens a great textural element to the dish and the wantons, simple yet complex in its aroma and flavor!

We followed it with fried chicken wantons and chicken in black bean sauce. The wantons were crispy and flaky which is good and the flavor was amazing as well while the chicken balls tossed in balack bean sauce was one of the best I had ever tasted.

One thing, they do not serve pork which was surprising considering its closest competitions are known for their pork dishes, but whatever they serve they are pretty good at it! ¬†A must visit if one wants to stay away from teh usual haunts and yet want to taste some authentic oriental flavours.

Date of Visit ‚Äì 18/04/2017

Location ‚Äì It is located on back side of Poddar Court building. 5 minutes walk from central metro & 2 min walk from lal bazaar.

Ambience ‚Äì It's a small eatery and no great ambience is expected. But the place is clean. It's around 20 seater eatery with plastic tables & chairs.

Service ‚Äì The service was prompt. 

Food & Description ‚Äì A foodie friend was near my office at Poddar Court and he called me for a sudden craving of Chinese food. So we decided to visit this eatery which is nearby my office. Coming to the food:

Crispy Chilli Babycorn ‚Äì It was crispy, spicy and tasty. Great flavours.

Veg Mushroom Corn Fried Rice ‚Äì Fried rice with added mushrooms & Babycorns. It is one of the best fried rice ever had. It dnt had that much of oil and the quantity was huge. A must try here.

Veg Manchurian ‚Äì Manchurian balls were little hard but the gravy was good.Quantity was also good

Overall the experience was great. Food was very tasty. Being an eatery its a pocket friendly. Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - 250 for 2 approx.

Another hotel serving Chinese food, in the Tiretti bazaar area. Nothing big about the place, the decor is shabby and more like a road side eatery. But one thing is certain.... You will definitely fall in love with the food they serve. Tried out various items here and each stood out in a unique manner. The Chicken Yam Mein is excellent (boiled noodles, chicken and vegetables, together tossed in very little oil) . The dish is very light, yet very tasty....and definitely a welcome break from the conventional chowmein. The Chilli Chicken and Manchurian Chicken were well done too. But for me the highlights were the Chicken Mon Chow Soup and the Drinking Chicken. The Drinking Chicken consisted of chicken wings dipped and fried in wine and was delectable . Many may not like the strong aroma of burnt wine , but that is exactly what made this dish so different. And the quantity they serve is humongous. The pocket pinch is so little that it feels like a light touch (and not a pinch). 

Verdict: Good food at a very reasonable price.... What else can a foodie want?

After reading great reviews¬†I went¬†to this restaurant during lunch hours.

Ordered Chicken volcano and Chicken Singapore Rice.

The restaurant was not very much crowded. So the food did not take much time to come either.

The Chicken volcano was great, it was crispy on the outside, layered with sauce and soft inside. It was very spicy. It will taste great as a side with a chilled beer. - 5/5

Coming to the rice or rather chow-rice, I did not like it. The taste was too uniform, the rice, the noodle, the chicken pieces, the little bit veggies, all tasted the same... it was too spicy and hot. It lacked texture. - 1/5

I was somewhat disappointed with the rice, and had to drink¬†a bottle of Mirinda to ease my stomach.

I went here for trying out authentic Chinese food in a pocket friendly price. Despite very average looking exterior and interior, the owners of the restaurants have stick to good quality food. Chicken volcano, mixed schezwan rice, chicken in black bean sauce everything was tasty and served in clean plates. Cold drinks are available at almost normal market prices. Definitely a thumbs up. Recommended for everyone, friends for a dine out and delivery for family.

Went to Tung Naam around 4 pm but since it was closed tried this restaurant.
Not a place to be going with family so went alone to have some authentic Chinese but the food was OK.
Ordered chilly button mushrooms and chilly garlic noodles. Mushrooms were good but very less in quantity and noodles tasted like Hakka.
No points for ambience or service. 
Good option for office goers but little pricey.

There are few places which are hard to discover but when you get there you are in love with it. Pou Hing which is close to my place but remained undiscovered by me until i saw it on Zomato. Went there last evening. Tried their Mixed Chowmine, Singapore Fried Rice and Chicken Hot and Garlic both tasted extremely well. The noodles quality was great. Also the quantity was okay to serve two people. Food looked clean all though the place is bit clumsy and the surrounding of the restaurant is dirty.
Total value for money and delicious food.

I tend to visit places whose main motto is to serve food sans the ambience,luxury, ghorar matha etc. Now Ihave only two parameters to rate: one is tge food offered, the other being the pocket pinch. Well, analysing the first point, the food is very good. But you know what the funny thing is? The pocket pinch is so low that it mkes the food awsome. Seriously, how often do you visit a place where aftr spending around 600 for two people you come home with parcelled leftovers?

So, verdict: a straight fucking 5! 

P.s: do visit, because if you don't these small eateries will die out slowly, not because they are incompetent but because they do not pack such a pomp in advertising or showoff. It will be a shame for us Calcuttans if we let these things go back into oblivion like this. And also, if you do visit, please spread the word. Thank you!

Went there with my friend.  The test, quantity and the price is simply outstanding. We ordered for a soup and a starter. O my God size of the soup bowl   is huge. Its like we have ordered family size but its only 1/2 in 100 bucks. Size of the each piece of the starter was pretty  big and delicious.  It is really different from other local Chinese food which is we call kolkata-chinese food. We loved it and planing for next trip. Place is clean but if any one want ambience then it is not the place for it. I am really sad for this.

If you want to know, how a Hidden gems can satisfy your taste buds, then you should come to this Restaurant!

The restaurant situated in Tiretti Bazar area. Very close to Tung Num and D'Ley restaurant! Better if you use ur GPS on your phone! The main banner is almost hidden by the other content of the surrounding! So better open your eyes cz it might happen that, you are in front of it but still not finding it!

The restaurant may seem dirty, unhealthy from outside but the inside of it is totally different! Big space, no fancy decorations, basic table chair sitting arrangement! The restaurant is also clean, so issue regarding hygiene level!

When we enter the restaurant, the person who was on the cash counter, gave us chilled water bottle and menu card! After a few moments, he came came again and took our orders! So lack of stuffs are clearly shown here!!! But the service is quiet fast!

By help of some reviews on Zomato, we first order Chicken Yaam Mein and Chicken Volcano! Then after complete it, we order Chicken Shanghai Rice and Drinking Wings!

Chicken Yaam Mein - It was basically a sweet noodles, tossed in sweet Sauce! Not a Spicy at all. Little bit of oily in nature, so perfect main course for any Spicy Side dish! Sufficient amount of Chicken pieces are there, well gurnished by green herbs and the quantity of the noodles was enough for two persons!

Chicken Volcano - It is a must try item here! 8 pieces small but not too small chicken pieces are there! Perfectly cooked with right amount of spices! Not over spicy and oily in nature make this one a perfect match for any sweet main dish! A Omlette, cooked in puffy way are placed over the chicken pieces. So the outer look is same mouth watering like its taste! Strongly recommend!

Chicken Shanghai Rice - After trying the sweet main dish, we were looking for a Spicy main dish! So by help of the person who was in the cash counter, we ordered this one! When the dish came, we were surprised to see, that it was basically a noodle rice! Just in one word, woooow!! Spicy in nature but not too spicy! Well cooked chicken pieces and perfect blend of oil and spice make this one really a worthy trying! The amount is still sufficient for two persons! Try it!

Drinking Wings - After doing some research, taking some reviews on Zomato, my friend Oishik Sarkar ordered this one! Surprisingly the dish makes us surprised when it came cz it was winey smell was coming out from all over the dish! Yes the dish was cooked with wine and you can feel it everytime you take a bite! 8 mid sized well cooked Spicy boney Chicken pieces were there! There was no such review was there on Zomato, that mentioned this wine touch of this dish, so the dish was a real surprise for us and we accept it! You can try it as a starter item, if you are a fan of wine!

Taking all the dish mentioned above, it cost only 485 INR, so you can imagine how cheap this restaurant is. In the conclusion, I can easily say that, Pou Hing is a underrated restaurant in Zomato, may be due to its difficult location and surrounding! You might not bring your dear ones or girlfriend here due to its surrounding environment, but you are a great fan of Chinese cuisines, then try this restaurant for once!

Had ordered online from zomato. Bad quality food. Rice was a bit watery and weird in taste. Sesame chilli Chicken and Drums of heaven was made too spicy even though i instructed them not to make it too spicy. Nearly vomitted having the steamed chicken wantons. Only thing good was the lemon coriander soup. Even the crispy chilli baby corn was tossed in some red sauce which was weird in taste and it was not fried at all. It tasted sour as it was spoilt. Would not suggest anyone to go there. If you want pocket friendly food go to other good joints nearby.

I just love their food. We ordered  chicken volcano, drinking wings and chicken wonton yam mein.focusing on food i didn't  bother about the ambiance. Service  was pretty quick. It may not be a well furnished  one but i didn't  find anything  un hygienic.. come back to food.. volcano was delicious... drinking wings was something  new i have ever explored. Nonetheless  a good experience... it was made by Chinese rice wine.. people who doesn't  like the flavour of wine... try to avoid this item... here we come to wonton yam mein... something new... like the wontons but the noodles  were thick and super oily.. a big thumbs down for it..

Among the restaurants which serve delicious Indian Chinese at pocket friendly rates, Pou Hing is one of the best. We have been eating here for a long time now and it is one of our favourite places for comfort food. Located on the lane behind Poddar Court, in the busy business district of Calcutta, this place is a favourite among the office goers who work nearby. The dining hall is a simple, vanilla one with clean tables and normal, comfortable chairs. The menu is a long one and provides a lot of variety, though one thing we miss here is pork. They don‚Äôt serve pork.

One of the best chinese eatery in kolkata near central metro.If one does not care much about ambiance and interior but food then this restaurant it is.
The food is simply awesome.
One must try its lungfung soup along with other dishes.Its one of the best soup I ever had.

Pou Hing is another authentic Chinese restaurant in Bara Bazaar area. Its probably not that much highly rated, but with some of their dishes they are truly a hidden gem for Chinese food lovers.

Location : Pou Hing is few steps away from Tung Nam or D'Ley. It's actually located at Bara Bazaar or near to Central Metro. This one is very hard to find, although its on open street still the dirty messed up street is able to hide this place well. Not only that non maintained & dirty banner of the restaurant mixed up with the old building that makes it hard to locate even if you are standing in front of it. Hands down for the disguisting road, anyway clean your specs & focus on Google Maps.

Decorations : From outside Pou Hing looks ugly, dirty & not preferable at all. Where after getting inside you will find old school basic looks. Nothing on decorations, its non AC, long celling fans hanging from the celling & simple lightings. The restaurant is overall clean but it highly needs new touch & maintaince.

Staffs & Management : There was lack of staffs clearly seen. The person on the cashier took our order & another person served us. I must say they serve quite fast, although that time the restaurant was pretty empty.

Chinese Delight : Seeing most of the photos & reviews on Zomato & by the guidance of their staffs we decided to go with their most famous Chicken Volcano & Drinking Wings.

Chicken Yaam Mein : They have used very thick noodles for it. It was white, non spicy, just a little oily, mixed & served with green leafs on it. Very less but unshaped long soft chicken pieces were there. It tasted very very lite, just like it was steamed & served. Noodles were extremely soft & melting in the mouth. Its ideal with a spicy side dish & lovely for non spicy food lovers. We took the Chicken Volcano with it...

Chicken Volcano : The volcano on the chicken pieces  were actually an egg fried in the puffy way that it looked like a small volcano. There was 8 small boneless pieces of chicken in a plate. I must say this dish was excellent. The dish was dry, chicken pieces were soft & spicy. A rich saucy flavour was there & that tasted awesome. Perfect amount of spices made it wonderful as a starter or with main dish. This dish not just looks delicious on photos, it tasted mouth watering too & its a must try if you visit this place.

Chicken Shanghai Rice : Shanghai Rice was a mixed dish of Noodles & Rice that's not usually found in every Chinese restaurant. Rice & noodles were very nicely cooked & mixed with lots of spices. Very few vegetables was found but mix of chicken & fried egg pieces fulfilled that. This dish was extremely hot & spicy that made my eyes & nose wet. A spicy side dish with it is little hard to eat.

Drinking Wings : Just like the name, the Chicken was completely drunk. I mean chicken wings were dipped & fried with wine. Rich burned wine fragrance filled up the place after the dish came to our table. Chicken pieces were well cooked & soft. It was very spicy but juicy from outside. However the burned wine flavor is not likely by everyone. It is a rich dish targeted to the wine lovers, if you aren't from them then you probably shouldn't order it.

Pricing : The bill for all the above mentioned items were Rs. 485 without any extra taxes. Food quality & quantity was great as per the price but they can focus on the ambience a bit.

Conclusion : Pou Hing is little underrated because of its location, ambience, atmoshgere & environment. You shouldn't probably go over there with your Chinese food lover girl friend. But if you love food & can forgot those things then they have very nice food to appriciate your love.

The drinking chicken is as good as it is touted to be. The chicken wanton soup is very filling and soothing. It was a chance combination but it worked wonderfully. I'd suggest it. Although the service is poor because the place seems to be understaffed.

I think I should name this place as "tung nam sibling" :Pthe place is located just a stone's throw away from Tung Nam at Tiretti Bazaar. not so eye pleasing place but can surely please ur appetite very much !!! again thanks to Zomato for the recommendation of this place. we went in the afternoon time and the place was quite full with other customers. we were lucky to find a table for us. without any delay we ordered for chicken lung fung soup and drinking wings. both were just amazing. the soup was quite full with mushroom and shredded chicken. what to say about drinking wings??? my heart went just singing after having it :P it was absolutely a star on the plate. only problem with this place I found was that there was only one guy doing everything from billing to taking orders and serving. so the promptness with the service was missing. but never mind.. when they serve food this tasty I really can manage all problems :Dprice was absolutely smooth on the pocket... I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit to this place .

I don't know if I shud tag this place as a "hidden gem" like others did...but surely I can that this place serves authentic Chinese cuisine and not the the Indian version of Chinese cuisine... :p
The prices are prety reasonable... Not like those tengra Chinese restaurant....
I will just review on the foods I tasted...

Chicken wanton steam: it tasted OK...not that great though...the fillings I felt was little less...

Drinking chicken: its a dry item...its made with startch, as in if u keep the starch for a while it turns into wine.... Basically rice wineis what they've used to make this item...hence the name "drinking".... Anyways, taste wise I didn't like it cuz I am not used to wine n all...so my taste bud cudnt adjust with it....

Pou Hing Special Fried Rice: this spcl fried race had chicken, egg, mushroom and prawn....well, if there was no prawn in it, it would have tasted really good...I don't know if the prawn was fresh or not...I feel the prawn ruined the taste....

Kum pao chicken: this was somehow better then the rest of the item and therefore i cud mix with fried rice and eat it...or else the rice wud have been leftover....

Volcano Chicken: ahh!! This was easily the star of the night...the best amongst the 5 things we ordered...and actually it tasted really good....if I go to this place again,  I'd repeat this item for sure...and try newer items along with it...

All in all an OK place....wud like to try out few other dishes before deciding on if i shud scrap it out or not from the list completly....

Will keep on updating this review and so will the rating fluctuate accordingly...

We work in Dalhousie area and getting a good quality Chinese food joint is pretty tough..! So, finding Pou Hing was a jackpot!! We ordered for full house, Gravy Noodles, Hakka Noodles, Chicken szechuan and chilli chicken dry. And Boy! It was delicious!! The only con was the size of the chicken pieces. 

It's a thumbs up!! :)

Pou Hing blew my mind with its Chicken Volcano. Spicy chicken that erupts fire when you eat it. The wontons are really impressive; in fact this being my first experience with wontons, I loved them. The restaurant looks very old and dilapidated, probably adds to the flavour of this hidden Burra Bazar joint.

The restaurant is an old restaurant of Tiretta Bazar and free of frills.The walls are ill-maintained. It was a Saturday afternoon and I found only a Chinese couple eating and a solo waiter.

Since it was my first time here, I ordered a safe choice- Chicken fried rice and Fish Manchurian. The friend rice was tasty and enough for a single person. The chicken was sliced and succulent. The Fish Manchurian was good too. The fish was soft and flaky and cooked with a thin batter, as it should be. The waiter asked me whether I wanted it dry. I specified that I wanted it with some gravy and it was prepared exactly that way. As the only minor blemish, I wish the gravy were less oily.

It is non-AC and you should be prepared for a few mosquito bites too. Decent food should be the only reason one can go there.

Got some take away packs from Pou Hing yesterday. Four packets of chilli chicken and mixed fried rice.Rice was Very average in taste, nothing to write about, though it had prawns and chicken strips in abundance. Chicken dish was good enough , the pieces were soft and had the typical indo chinese chilli gravy. Satisfactory experience for the price.

Another find from Zomato. First we had Lung Fung Soup. The quantity was more than enough for 3 persons. It was a good appetizer and we relished every bit of it.Then we ordered Chicken Volcano. It was also delicious. Came with 8 bite sized pieces of sweet and spicy chicken. Then we had Chicken Sechzuan Hakka Chow. It was a little oily but okayish. Then another friend joined and ordered veg sweet corn and mushroom rice and sechzwan fish.Again with the large quantity of the rice we fought to finish it ( we were full). The fish was super spicy and hot. Overall we all liked it and planning to visit soon.

I absolutely loved this place.I am a Zomato addict and if not for zomato I would have missed on many joints which serve awesome food,and Pou Hing definitely would have been on that list of mine.One should not judge this joint by its appearance. Situated in old Territy Bazar , this a small Chinese restaurant with just 20-22 seats.When we reached here , after ignoring our strong urge to enter Tung Nam (again!) , we were delighted to say the least.We ordered their trademark Drinking wings, Pou Hing special fried rice and Chicken in Ginger Sauce.I must say,service was really quick.All dishes were superb, but the best was the Drinking Wings , chicken wings made with red wine , each bite was like biting into heaven, with the spices hitting the right note . The special fried rice was good and the quantity was more than enough for two, apart from the usual ingredients it had babycorns and mushrooms in it. The Chicken in Ginger sauce was also very tasty though we were almost full when we finally came to it.I am glad wewe had ordered it 'small' (4 pieces).Overall if you have no issues with ambience , you must visit for reasonably priced Chinese food. Strongly recommended.
*Second visit*
Same as first. Awesome food. We had Drinking Wings (yet again),Mixed Fried Rice, Lemon Chicken(very tangy) and
 Hong Kong Chicken.

We took an adventurous trip to tiretti bazaar poddar court area to try out the amazing chinese cuisine when we fell upon this place..the decor is not very pleasing and u might think its not worth a visit..but the food is better and tastier than whats on the outside..we ordered chicken pepper for starters..it was good on the palate..chicken hakka noodles and chicken manchurian for the main course..again it was pretty delicious..itz very difficult to explain the existence of such simple yet authentic chinese cuisine amidst the chaos which surround the place..overall a good experience..

Its barely 50 yards from legendary TUNG NAM just besides d turn to poddar court from chattawala gully, Fairly clean but there seems problem regarding ventilation we almost choked by pungent smell of chillies while cook was busy in preparing our dish! Regarding food taste not as good as its famous rival tung nam, quantity seems great but sm dish like fried rice have sm peculiar smell! Over all its a pocket friendly option if u like to venture but if u r experienced with tung nam its not an option u one should opt for

Chinese food from Pou Hing is like Chinese food from Tung Nam, which in turn in like Chinese Food from Golden Joy and Beijing. Once you've tasted one of these shops, you've possibly tasted all of them. Then again, each have their own standout dishes.

Pou Hing is not air conditioned, with limited seating and the most basic cutlery and crockery you'll ever find. If the ambience and interiors are worth nothing, then the food is worth its weight in gold. Pou Hing serves only Chicken, Fish and Prawn -- so if you're looking for Pork or Beef, try someplace else. Their chow is great, and so are their sides. All you need is 200 Rupees in your pocket and you're in for a heavy meal. Love how quality meets quantity meets pricing in the Heart of Bara Bazaar.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Pou Hing is a very small outlet, located just 10 mins from Central station. First of all, one should not go here if one wants a lot of ambience and posh dining conditions. This is a perfect place to go if one is on a tight budget, and a great place for good "adda". Me and my friend went here and remained for almost 3 hours.
The place is quite clean; and the food is very good. We started with chicken wanton soup, "drinking wings" and chicken volcano. The soup was good in taste, but the chicken dishes were the ones that got the taste buds excited. Use of an egg yolk on top made the chicken volcano dish very interesting, and the drinking wings were equivalently good. The chicken was quite juicy and fresh..and the pieces were big. Next, we took the Pou Hing Special fried rice, along with a sweet and sour chicken. The quantity was enormous and it was just because we ate like gluttons did we manage to finish it. At the end of all this..the bill came to be only about 250 rupees per head.
Overall, this is not the place for a formal occasion, but a very good place for chinese food; and I would recommend it.

After a long time I revisited this restaurant. It‚Äôs located just behind Poddar court building and five min walk from central metro station. Me and my friend Sayan want to have some light evening snacks and we thought Pou Hing will be perfect for that. This small eatery and can accommodate maximum 20 people at a time. Please don‚Äôt expect any ambiance here but tables were clean enough. 

We decided to have ‚ÄòChicken Lung Fung‚Äô soup and ‚ÄòChicken Volcano‚Äô. Service was amazingly quick. Chicken Lung Fung Soup tastes marvelous, fillings and flavor was also perfect. Quantity was very impressive. Chicken Volcano was nicely cooked, use of egg yolk on the top made it look more interesting. Chicken pieces they used were fresh and juicy. As soon you take your first bite, spices will definitely start playing with your tongue. If you are near Poddar court area you could certainly give it a try but I will not recommend this place for a full course meal.

After today's exam my friend & I decided to eat out at pou hing due to it's budget friendly menu :3. Its located just 2mins ahead of Tung naam!! Decent sitting capacity with the hygeine well maintained.

Our order consisted of the following:-

1. Chicken friedrice= my friend had ordered this for himself & the way he gulped it down gave an idea that it was well made. The quantity as well was wholesome!!

2. Szechwan chicken friedrice= This was my order & tasted decent,not the best but it was good enough eat. Not very spicy & less oily with generous amounts of chicken & veggies. The chilli sauce used for it was good as well

3. Chilli Chicken(small)= It consisted of 4 small pieces of chiken,the sizes could have been bigger in my personal opinion but was well made & was tasty.

The total bill came to 255 with no extra taxes charged. Also the menu prices have increased than what it has been listed here in zomato

Finally made it there. Locating the place was painful since i am not at all familiar with the teriti bazar area. Very in conspicuous. Just bang on behind Poddar court building best accessed from the southernmost gate of Central metro station. ambiance is non-existent, an old building with peeling wall, shabby paintjob and high ceiling, the space is surprisingly clean and airy. I wanted to sample as much of the fare as possible so decided to pt for a takeaway. I ordered the much appreciated wanton soup, steamed wanton, chicken garlic yam mein, drinking chicken and crispy chicken. The waiter came and informed that wantons were not enough to make both the soup and the wanton dish, so i cancelled the soup and asked them to do the wantons only. The wantons were really good, melt in your mouth with silky wrappings. The yam mein was plain but very tasteful with thick stands of noodles coated in garlicky oil and bits of chicken. I did not particularly like the crispy chicken although the quantity was great. I loved the drinking chicken which was not too spicy and had a very nice smoky sweet kind of flavour. My bill total came to exact 450/- which was astonishing considering how much food i have ordered!!
I am saving 0.5 points until i try their wanton soup and special chowmein. Hoping to visit the place again very soon. Till then, Pou Hing serves above average chinese dishes at prices that will make you wonder about what era you are living in!! ;)

And my craving for chinese starts all over again and I desperately start searching for new chino joints until I come across this one zomato. Initially thought it was near dalhousie, but later on giving them a call they informed me, that this was in chhattawala gully, poddar court.  So mum and me set out for mission pou hing. We took the left from the maharana pratap statue newr central metro. A walk of good 5 minutes will take you to tung naam on the left and if you still keep walking two minutes, you will locate pou hing on the right side of the road. On entering was pleased to see the joint. Unlike other cheap chino joints it was not messy n dirty, rather well kept, well lit and the culinary was clean. started of with the wonton soup. The soup tasted amazing. It was served in two portions, and each portion was huge and filling. A must try.  Then ofcourse wanted to do meat. When I was deciding on the meat the waiter suggested drinking chicken. When it arrived , it was a treat to the eyes, smelled amazing and tasted yummilicious.  It was basically chicken wings in red wine. You could taste the burnt wine and I would say the best chicken wings I have possibly tasted. So drinking chicken is a must. We were so filled that we actually had to skip the main course. So am yet to try their noodles and rice. But another wonder dish was the prawn. Initially we had ordered in for salt and pepper prawn, but as the sauce was over the staff suggested us shanghai prawn. It tasted amazing , cooked to perfection. I am definitely going back soon until I get bored of eating chinese.

P.S: thank you zomato for another major find of my life

This definitely had to be my first review. This has become one of my most frequently visited places. Located in a shady place quite close to Central metro station but surprisingly serves amazing food. I am a big time foodie and a die hard Chinese cuisine lover. This place serves by far the BEST Chinese food I've ever had in Kolkata, and most importantly at such a reasonable price. Amazingly pocket friendly. One must come here if he/she wants to have great Chinese food at a minimal pocket pinch. And the QUANTITY is unbelievable. Also, I love the buttery flavor which can be found in most of the dishes. The boy who serves food is very humble and well behaved. 
I was skeptic at first but ever since I had the food, I am in love with this place. 
Personal favorites: Chicken Hakka Chow (OMG!), Lung Fung Soup, Chicken Wanton Soup, Drinking Wings, Volcano Chicken and Yummein.
Only negative aspect- They don't serve Pork.
Do try this place out if you are interested in the quality and quantity of food and not the location. I am sure you won't be disappointed. :)

I went to this place after finding it on Zomato. It is just beside poddar court. I have visited poddar court many a times but never noticed this restaurant. It is surely hard to find this restaurant unless u are aware of that place or well guided. The restaurant is actually by the road only but due to its shabby surrounding it is hard to notice it. It's actually not a restaurant it just a basic eating point with simple and clean ambience. Food is average. Had this place been in Park Street or sector v this would not have even made it to Zomato's list at all. But because it is present in a place where it is very hard to find a reasonable place to eat with sitting and proper hygiene. The business goes on.

Pao Hing! The name says it all...

A blink and miss Chinese restaurant in the never ending lanes of Kolkata is reason enough to visit this place.  My mind said just another Chinese place but was adamant to find out more about this. 

A 10 min walk from Central Metro Station and behind Poddar Chambers lies this small Chinese joint with a sitting capacity of 20 patrons. It's a no frills restaurant with hardly any people noticing the same. Also remember If you have had the Mumbai version of Chinese than this is not the place for you. It serves authentic Chinese stuff and the food could taste bland for the average Mumbaite. 

Start off with the Lung Fung Soup and just savour the delight while it plays havoc with your taste buds. The Fried Wantons are a strict No-No since it has more oil than the Bay of Bengal. Also not recommended are any of the fried rice but instead try from the vast arrays of noodles. 

Overall a good experience for the price that you pay and value for money meal. One-time okay!!!

A frustating day + a starving foodie. That surely requires a nice lunch to balance things out.

And that was exactly my condition today. It was already about 3, and after a really bad day, I needed some good food. So I decided to try out Pou Hing, after finding it at Zomato, as it had some good reviews, and it was the nearest to my location.

For those who know Tiretti Bazar, this will be extremely easy to find. It is in Tiretti Bazar basically, behind Poddar Court. 

For those who don't. If you get down at Central Metro, near the Shivaji Statue, then you take the lane to your right, and you will cross Phears Lane , and a couple of others before you arrive at Poddar Court. Take the lane on your left just before Poddar Court, and this is will to your right. 

I reached the place at around 3:30. The place was almost empty. 
The odd thing about this place was that they had a single guy doing the accounts,and taking orders and cleaning tables. 

Coming to the food. After going through the reviews, I knew a couple of things. Their wanton soup is good, and so is the lung fung soup. And their fried rice is not that good.

Keeping that in mind, I knew I had to order either a wanton soup or a lung-fung soup. I decided to stick to wanton soup. Along with that, as I was really hungry, I ordered a chicken hakka chowmein.

The wanton soup arrived in almost no time. And I am really glad I ordered that. A large bowl of around 6-7 wantons with nice hot and light soup. Just what I needed after the tiring day. The wantons wrappers were really smooth. The filling was great according to my taste. The only problem I had with the dish was the salt content. It was really low on salt, and pepper. But then you can always balance it out according to your taste. 

I had merely midway finishing the soup, and they served the noodles. That is not expected usually. There is a reason why soups and sizzlers are called 'starters'. But I was too busy concentrating on the soup, and dumped the idea of complaining about that. Also, he was the only guy running the show, in front atleast. So no real complaints.

The chowmein however was a bit disappointing. It was oily. They could have used a bit less of oil, and it would have been great. Also, they probably added the chicken pieces separately, and for some reason, the chicken pieces were cold, while the rest of the noodles was still hot.
No complaints regarding the taste though. 
And the amount is actually more than enough for one individual. I really struggled to finish it up in the end :P

Overall. A satisfied foodie at the end of the day. Good food. Decent price. 

Looking forward to give it another visit sometime soon.

I discovered this place while scrolling through zomato, going by its reviews and cheap price I decided to pay this place a visit. I had a hard time to locate this place. I visited this place with a friend around 2- 2.15 pm for lunch, the place was completely empty. An old fashioned eating hall with 9 to 10 tables. No marks for decor and ambiance.Service was prompt. There was only one staff who took order and served us. Coming to food, we ordered:

pow hing special soup
mixed mei foon
chicken babycorn & mushroom¬†
kung pow chicken

Food was not so impressive except the mei foon, babycorn in the chicken dish was not boiled properly and tasted bland, in kung pow chicken the chicken pieces were not tender, soup was okayish. Quantity wise good.My overall experience was not too good but if you are looking for a cheap place to have chinese near poddar court area you can give this place a try.

The narrow lanes around Poddar Court are well known for the super friendly inhabitants of Tiretti Bazaar serving their long-established Chinese breakfast at the crack of dawn, best enjoyed during the misty winter mornings of Kolkata and which takes a mandatory spot in any foodie‚Äôs wish list. But that sketches the scenario prevailing in this grid of alleys only till noontide. The scene is quite different after dusk when food joints are replaced by the bulk of crates waiting to be traded, people working in the dark shadows formed by dimly lit bulbs and the few remnants of the recently celebrated Chinese New Year. 
A non-successful plan of rummaging through the second hand book stalls next to the Writers‚Äô Building and plain curiosity towards Pou Hing after reading a certain review drew us there. The first lane (Sunyat Sen Street) next to Poddar Court followed by the first left turn brought us in front of this oldie with swinging half doors, out of a Western movie.
The place was almost empty that evening and our food came in shortly after placing the orders for Chicken Drumsticks and Lung Fung soup.  
The lung fung soup was a great relief after that entire walk. It had prawns, mushroom, chicken, egg and chopped vegetables in a hot broth which seemed to soothe our taste buds. The drumsticks however had more of a thick floury coating and very less chicken which weren‚Äôt perfectly cooked. We were compelled to wash it down with a cold drink.
There were a few diners who had their food packed for take away or delivered and we regretted not having their noodles instead of the drumsticks. This place needs another visit before I can find a truly likeable dish. Otherwise, it‚Äôs highly affordable with good service and a clean dining space.

It was a nice place. Not very up to the mark but clean enough. We went there on last week in a hot sunny day. Those friendly stuffs promptly  welcome us with chilled water. It was nice enough. 
Now to the food. We ordered Fried chicken wanton, Chicken mei foon and Chicken with blackbean sauce. Wantons was hot & crisp. I found the mei foon a bit chewy, but my sis said it was perfect. And the Chicken in black  sauce was nice. We enjoyed it very much. And now we are in plan to visit again soon. 
Just one wish, if beer was available there !!!

I'll tell you what Pou Hing offers- brilliant food in dirt cheap prices! This is THE cheapest place I've ever been to that offers Chinese, and I love it! Being one of the first generation Chinese joints to open in Calcutta, you have a certain expectation about the quality of food when you go there. They deliver. 

The ambiance is nothing to write home about. It's a small place, 4-5 tables scatters without any proper pattern, but clean enough. But you're there for food, so you concentrate on the menu. They have a host of soups, Chow meins, Yam meins, chicken and prawn dishes to choose from, and taking a look at the prices, you'll want to order 'em all.

Me and my partner decided on Chicken Wanton soup, chicken lung fong soup, mixed fried rice and chicken manchurian. The soups were as good I ever had. The wantons were smooth as silk, me closing my eyes with every spoonful! The Lung fong soup were an even better affair. Small shreds of chicken, egg and prawn in a delicious broth, ecstasy! Honestly after the soups, I'd rather have had another bowl of the same than rice and manchurian. Sadly, the fried rice was below par. A bad day in kitchen or what I don't know, But it tasted kinda charred, a smell of garlic overpowering everything else. Chicken manchurian was a regular affair, spicy and delectable (with some handiwork of artificial food color), it somehow helped us gulp most of the rice down! By the time we were finished, I knew we'd have to take a cab home, we were that full! But the real star of the show was yet to come. The bill! 300 bucks for all these! No kidding! I'll be back here before you know it. Next time, Yam mein and chicken in black bean sauce! :D

I havnt been there, but my friend got back the food and my,my,my-the food was glorious. Best chicken in black bean sauce ive ever had! I couldnt stop licking the container clean. The dumpling soup was light and melt in your mouth. Mixed pan fried noodles was good, nothing exceptional like the chicken in black bean sauce, youve had similar stuff in other good resturants, but good none the less. I cant wait to go and try the other stuff!

Went to this place yesterday for having dinner. The address was given as Dalhousie BBD Bagh but if you reach this place you will get to know that this place is far enough from Dalhousie. If you have been to places around Teriti Bazar or Poddar Court you will easily get this place.We ordered Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. We ordered two fried rice which was enough for three of us. The quality was also good had a lot of Chicken pieces in it. The Chilli chicken was also good. We were the only persons dining there at that moment all other were waiting for their take outs. For the food i would give this restro 3.5 but for the price and quantity this place surely deserve 4.5 :-) This place really makes you feel that there is no inflation..

I have been to Pou Hing a few times, and my latest venture was a ridiculously fun one. We went inside and found it clean although nothing much decor wise. We ordered the following - 

1. Lung Fung Soup
2. Chicken Won Ton Soup
3. Chicken Won Ton Yam Mein 
4. Chicken Garlic Yam Mein
5. Chicken Steamed momos (we had ordered steamed won tons, but they had run out of it). 
6. Shanghai Chicken

Apart from the Shanghai Chicken , which was the server's suggestion (after we declined chicken in Hamei Sauce) and the dip that came with the momos, we loved each and every item on the menu. And, the best part - the bill, which is attached with pictures of some of the stuff we ate.

I wrote about my experience in more details at my blog- http://presentedbyp.blogspot.in/2014/01/pou-hing-eating-house-winter-eats.html

It was in my wishlist since I read good reviews of it. Though my current office is situated in Dalhousie, I could never trace it out while walking from my office towards Central metro station! Finally some days ago, I discovered this little restaurant placed beside Poddar Court gate #4. It hardly meets any criteria to meet the standard of a good restro. The location is filthy. Ambiance-wise it's absolutely quiet as it seems like nobody visits over here. The hygienic quality of food is also questionable. I ordered for schezwan fried rice, chicken rice noodles, kung pao chicken, prawn in black bean sauce, cashew nut chicken and asked for a parceled delivery, so that I could carry all those for sharing with family. And ordered for a dish of chicken volcano. As the proverb goes "never judge a book by its cover", the taste of food showed evidence of that saying! Chicken volcano was nicely made with right proportion of spices and it was served with savoury soya sauce. Schezwan fried rice was taste-wise okay but it was too oily. Meifoon threads were fine, but again it didn't have enough chicken in it. Both kung pao chicken and prawn in black bean sauce tasted good. Kung pao chicken was a bit too spicy for me since I could feel that gingers used were not nicely ground. Prawn quality was nice enough, and prawns were carefully de-veined. Cashew nut chicken lacked required taste, and it was just ordinarily made with much usage of thick arrowroot/cornstarch.. and a few cashew nuts were sprinkled over it just for show. Nevertheless, the price they charge is too cheap. So my overall rating would be 2.5 out of 5.

Very truly speaking even after reading all these reviews I dint expect this place to be so good. But was amazed when I tasted the food. Its really awesome and the pricing is also very affordable. Its not that beautifully decorated but its not that untidy or unhygienic. An overall  good experience will visit soon again.

Pou Hing!! Right behind Poddar Court!!
Let me start of with the looks, its a Non Ac restaurant with minimal seating with an average decoration.
I have to mention that the prices are very affordable but the quantity is not all that great, however, I guess these days you cant fine cheap price and hell lot of quantity.
Coming to the dishes, I had ordered the usual chicken sweet corn soup which was absolutely amazing and had decent pieces of chicken. In Starters, I had chicken momos, which was equally tasty but the size of the momos could have been better! I also tried the Chicken Mei Foon, it was tasty and delicious. Most of the side dish items in chicken, like the garlic or manchurian chicken are fabulous. Overall, if you are looking for a yummy chinese meal without pinching your pocket then my friend head to Pou Hing!!!

GOOD FOOD COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES!

Pou Hing in the Tiretta Bazaar area- is a small Chinese restaurant which offers tasty and quality food at reasonable prices. This small restaurant is not difficult to locate; it is right behind Poddar Court. The dining area is simple and clean with comfy sitting arrangements. The servers are friendly and the service is prompt and efficient. For certain dishes they let you know if they will take more time for preparing them. They have an extensive and exhaustive menu.

At the restaurant, place your order for their Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. The soup is sweet with generous amount of chicken pieces and corn pieces.  Another soup recommendation for all the foodies is their Chicken Wonton Soup. The soup with the wonton pieces is heavenly. For the main course, order the Chicken Fung Mee Mein from the noodles section. It is a sweetened version of chow. If you like the savory version of chow then order from the numerous chow items on offer there. Have this with either Chilli Chicken or Hot Garlic Chicken. Well cooked, strong flavor and aromatic. The chicken pieces are plentiful and tender. Their Sweet and Sour Prawn is another well made dish. The prawns are covered in thick gravy and the prawns themselves are meaty and juicy. It looks beautiful and rich in colour. For me, their prawn dishes rank higher than their chicken dishes. Other mouthwatering prawn items to be had from here are Chilli Prawn, Manchurian Prawn and Szechwan Prawn. If you prefer Mei Foon to rice then order for their Mixed Fried Mei Foon. The quantity is generous with everything wonderfully mixed. Their starters like Pepper Chicken and Chicken Lollipops are comparable to the starters served in high end restaurants. Even their Chicken Momos whether pan fried or steamed are finger licking good stuff.

Inarguably the cheapest Chinese restaurant in Calcutta which offers tasty and quality food. This small restaurant is located behind Poddar Court in the Tiretta bazar area which used to be the old China Town of Calcutta before Tangra. The dining hall is simple and clean. The service is friendly and fast almost all the time, though they take time for a few dishes and will let you know in advance.

Must try dishes include the wonton soup, chow chow rice (steamed rice with gravy) and mama dimsum. They serve an exceptionally huge amount of broth with the wontons and its a real comfort during the winters. Mama dimsum, a new item here and not yet included in their permanent menu, have five delicious steamed chicken Chinese baos. Most of the fish and chicken dishes are good, but the prawn dishes are better. Also if you love to experiment, they offer a variety of noodles apart from the regular ones.

Only negative is they don't serve pork dishes.
