I can go to this cafe on every week just because of their ambience. It's so cozy and comfortable that you would feel like having restaurant quality food seating in comfort of your room. They have 4 different sections, one with regular table and chair, another one with lots of books and board games where seating arrangement is on the floor and that is auper comfy, another room is with games for kids and last one is for team lunch, meeting etc! Here stafgs are so good that they would ask you to explore all the rooms !

Now coming to food,  we had HOT MOCHHA ( This was average I would say, could be better with some whipped cream on top), MEXICAN CHICKEN RICE MEAL ( Taste was spot on for this dish. It had spicy and tangy rice, julian cut chicken in spicy gravy with bell pepper and sauted vegetables. overall taste was really good. A must try I would say), ROYAL CARNIVOR PLATTER( This was a paradise with 2 sunny side up eggs, 2 chicken sausage, cold cut Ham, Grilled chicken, sauted vegetables and 2 dips. We found grilled chicken a bit dry, but other items were really good. Would be niver if accompanied with  mashed potato) and NON VEG PIZZA WITH GRILLED CHICKEN AND CHICKEN SAUSAGE (This is a real gem!! 8 slices of pizza filled with grilled chicken and sausage was best in taste and quantity. A wayyy better than popular pizza chains! Just order from here rather than wasting your money on those pizza chains!)

Food is good, ambiance is great, moreover light on your wallet. What can be better than this!! Waiting to explore more of this place!!

In the fast growing Café tradition in town, people often forget to make create something new and wants to go with the following tradition. But going against that following same tradition and create something new is something which everyone really wants to appreciate. Courting Coffee is one of the off tradition café I’ve ever visited. The café located at the ground floor of a house and the floor is well utilized & converted into a family café. So let’s come and explore this place.

The café located at Saltlake Sec 2 area, near Tank no. 9. Follow your GPS if you don’t know this area. So not a hard thing to find it out.

There are four separate rooms that are decorated for different purpose. One is the main dining area and other three rooms are specially designed for Group dining, Meeting room & Kids Zone. So you can feel the homely ambiance all around you. Love the concept & maintenance.

We visited this restaurant at around 12PM and it was quite empty at that time. After a quick look at the menu, we ordered –

1.	Cappuccino (3.75/5) - Machine blended cappuccino, taste wise little strong but perfect as having breakfast. Overall good but I was expecting to have handmade beverage from this lovely café.

2.	Flavored Hot Chocolate (3.5/5) – Must try item for any Choco-lover. The beverage was little lite at starting but get denser toward bottom part. Perfect starting of a day with chocolate flavor.

3.	Belgian Waffle with Ice Cream (5/5) – Waffles with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and roasted Almond on top. The Belgian chocolate with the waffle makes this one a divine one. The dish was as good as was its presentation. Total 5/5 for this dish.

4.	Honey Butter Dry Fruit Waffle (4.75/5) – Golden waffles with lots of dry fruits like Cashew, Raisins etc. The Honey Butter touch add the real wow factor here. Just have a bite and you will feel it.

5.	Café Special Veg Pizza (3.25/5) – Regular taste veg pizza with multi-colour capsicum, Bell pepper, Black Olives and corn. Pizza was good when it was served hot but I found lack of cheesy touch over the bread and some portion of the bread was over baked.

6.	Veg Caesar Salad (2/5) – Fresh Lettuce served with few cottage fresh cheese cubes & capsicum. The salad was tossed with cream and served with few bread croutons. The taste was not so good & way below of our expectation.

7.	Fish n Chips (4.25/5) – 3 big pieces of fish fillet with soft coating from inside was serves with steamed peas & two types of dip. The fish was soft, juicy, fresh and well marinated. Love the dish.

8.	Chicken Wings with BBQ Sauce (4.5/5) – 5 pieces of mid-sized soft juicy chicken pieces were served with dips. The chicken pieces were well tossed in BBQ sauce. It had distinct sweet as well as tangy flavor. Inside the crispy coating, the juicy chicken really impressed me a lot.

9.	Mexican Rice Platter (Non Veg) (4.25/5) – The platter consist of a portion of rice with hot n spicy chicken gravy & sautéed veggies. Thin sliced chicken pieces were well cooked with the spicy gravy. The tangy & spicy rice failed to impress me but the sautéed veggies do impress me a lot. Overall a nice item to try for.

In conclusion, I will say Courting Coffee is one of the homely feel café I’ve ever visited. The food was good & personally I think some need to improvise a little. Overall it was okay. They also sell muffins & cupcakes so have it, if you love it. Overall a good dining experience from my side.

Cafe Courting Coffee is a home based cafe serving great food with home like feeling. Its very hard to figure out from outside that they have 4 different rooms inside the cafe. One reading room where sittings are on the ground and book shelf full of books, One kids room with toys, One meeting room with a tv in front and the cafe dine itself.

We started our breakfast here with Cappuccino, Flavoured Hot Chocolate, Cafe Latte & Strong Black Coffee. Then we continued it with this…

Cafe Special Veg Pizza :
---------------------------------
Pizza in breakfast, Are you kidding me? Yes, thats how we foodies group sometime starts our day. This pizza was simply made and looked delicious when served hot. It tasted quite simple with fresh cut bell peppers, corns and black olives. Little more cheese could’ve made it more tastier.

Chicken Wings with BBQ Sauce :
------------------------------------------
This chicken wings was tossed in spicy and tangy sauce that tasted brilliant with the flavour of herbs and it was juicier inside. A must try over here. 

Fish n Chips :
---------------------------------
This fish item was served with boiled pea, french fries, mayonnaise and cheesy dip. Inside it was completely filled with pure fresh fish that tasted excellent. Boiled peas also tasted very nice.

Veg Caesar Salad : 
------------------------------------------
With lots of lettuce, bell peppers, carrot, toasties and fresh paneer pieces, this salad was tasty and healthy at the same time.

Mexican Rice Platter :
------------------------------------------
Spicy rice served with julienne cut chicken in hot spicy gravy and boiled vegetables. This dish was really hot and spicy for our breakfast.

Belgian Waffles with Ice Cream :
------------------------------------------
Waffles with ice cream, probably the best combination of all time in desserts. This one was also served with dark chocolate sauce and almonds on top.

Honey Butter Dry Fruit Waffle :
------------------------------------------
Same waffles this time with cashew, raisins, almonds and honey. This tasted just yum!

Cafe Courting Coffee was great and new experience from a view of Cafe. Another thing was the pricing, that was well set. This place is recommended to those looking for spending some quality time.

Coffee… Breakfast… Homely atmosphere..!! What else it would be better to make the morning so blissful… Breakfast and snacks at its best. The perfect joint in Salt Lake having cozy atmosphere with homely feeling. 

The things which attracted more in their decor is the section having books and board games. Perfect for a gang or a couple outing. Even they will provide you an area for official meeting as well as for a gang to see matches live together in their television room. One of the off beat restaurant for couple morning outing too. 

Now I come to the food matter. They have maintained hygine too. I must say the food is  good enough. The price range I will say it as moderate one but little bit on higher side.

The best in the list was Chicken wings with bbq sauce, Fish n chips, Belgian waffles with ice cream and Flavoured hot chocolate. There are on my recommendation list.
                                                                ...

“Courting” means to become romantically involved and “Courting Coffees” implies a relationship with beverages! This is a residential property converted to a neat café and one of it’s kind, based nearby the Tank no. 9 in Saltlake, Sector 2.

Work-chirp-slurp is their tagline implying they have space for holding official meetings and presentations (with a TV and meeting room styled seats), a dedicated area for regular seating and eating, a library styled room with books and cushions for a patient self-study as well as a separate room for kids with a few toys! All-in-all, it works as a family café!

Décor is fine, bong styled and hygiene needs to improve! We friends tried several items of which, the veg ones are enumerated below:-

(i)	Café special veg pizza – red, yellow, green capsicums, bell peppers, corn, olive, and what not, and lots of mayonnaise, of course. Fine on taste, but we expected the pizza base to be much better, as it was somewhat hard!

(ii)	Veg ceaser salad (with bread croutons) – Cabbage overdone and served along with a few cottage cheese slices, capsicum and other vegetable, cream and crispy bread croutons – way below expectations!

(iii)	Honey butter nutty waffle with dry fruit – The only item which compels us to rate this place so high – this goes down as the best waffle I ever had! Lots of honey butter, cashew, raisins and other dry fruits atop golden fried waffles – eat it to believe it!

(iv)	Mexican rice platter – Sampled the rice which failed to impress, but the sautéed vegetables served along were great!

(v)	Belgian chocolate waffle served with vanilla ice cream – A 5/5 for presentation, especially the Nutella topping deserves a special mention, served with a few slices of almond and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this one did impress us, although the waffles had become chewy by the time we had it!

(vi)	Cappucino – All beverages were vending machine generated, which again does not suit a café, as people prefer the hand-made ones more!

(vii)	Flavoured hot chocolate – Nice, not great though!

(viii)	Café latte – Was pretty strong and hence, somewhat bitter!

(ix)	Black coffee (strong)

Overall, a fine experience, though not pretty great! One can visit this place for a formal meeting, a date, a kids day out or some casual snacks!

The location was pretty odd. Took us some time to find it. The ambience was pretty good. Slow music and the light decorations made it a perfect evening for us. Coming to the food,the food was good and slightly on the healthier side. But the quantity of the food compared to the price was unsatisfactory. I'll pretty much keep this on the over priced side and it is definitely worth a visit but just for once

I like the ambience vary much. There is separate room..one with table chair sitting...and other with floor seating. Though I am tempted to go for floor seating but as it's already occupied so we grab one table. As it is basically ground floor of a two storeyed building, so it's a little congested and has few seating capacity. Anyways, we order hot chocolate which not at all up to the mark. It is tasted more like chocolate flavoured Horlicks. Not at all impressed​. Then we order chiken omlette. It comes with 4pc bread and some boilled veggies. This was nice. Omlette was fluffy and it satisfy our taste bud. The decoration is really fascinating. The illuminating bulbs hanging in zigzag manner in ceiling, walls floodied with sticky notes of customer's feedback and colourful decor items sooth our eyes. Those decors up for sale also.so all in all, I will must visit this place in near future for a pleasant time. Highly Recommended.

Have visited this place quite a few times. Interior is nice and comfortable. Service was rather slow, had to wait a long time before we finally received our food. Have tried various items like tea, chocolate shake, waffles, pasta, sandwiches, pizzas and all of them were quite good. Looking forward to visiting it many more times.

It's a small cute cafe located in salt lake city . The ambience is sweet and the behaviour of the staff is too friendly.  Pizza with chicken salami and shredded chicken was tasty and different from any other pizza parlour and mango smoothie is good but nothing extra ordinary in it.
The price is a bit high. Anyhow will recommend this place . 🤗

A Saturday morning during winters is for sleeping in late and waking up to moreish chicken sandwiches in bed.

I had wanted to try grub from this café for a long time so without even getting out of bed,I reached for my phone and ordered for their Non-veg grilled sandwich right away.

I customized my GRILLED NON-VEG SANDWICH(3/5) to have multi-grain bread,grilled chicken and cheese as fillings.

On getting the order,I was happy because the sandwich was hugeee.
Pros-
✔Huge quantity.
✔Filled to the brim with chicken
✔ Pretty decent taste.
Some notable cons would be
❌The multi-grain bread wasn't top-notch.It wasn't studded with seeds as it was supposed to be.
❌The whole sandwich along with the tomato ketchup left a sweetish after-taste which I hated.
❌The cheese filling was more like a cheese sauce rather than a nice,melty slice of cheddar.
❌I expected a side of a handful of crisps atleast.
These cons, which could be otherwise overlooked,became significant since the sandwich was priced at a whopping 175 rupees+taxes.When you're paying that much for a chicken sandwich you except the taste, quality of ingredients and sides ,all of them to be spot on.

I really like the vibe of the café from whatever pica I've seen on social media and would love to drop in someday to have a first-hand experience of their food and coffee.

Order number 2:
I ordered for a plate of cheesy garlic bread and pancakes with chocolate sauce and icecream.

The CHEESY GARLIC BREAD(2/5) wasn't nice at all.The bread was crusty,the cheese on top tasted like bad-quality processed cheese and there was no hint of garlic whatsoever.Avoid.

The PANCAKES WITH VANILLA ICECREAM AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE(4/5) on the other hand was delicious.The cooking of the actual pancakes were textbook,the vanilla icecream was yum but the chocolate sauce could've tasted better.There was too much vanilla and too little chocolate.Again,better ingredients could save the day.But overall it was total value for money.

After two deliveries,I still have mixed feelings about the grub that this café offers.

A sudden plan with my cousins gathered us all here... Cozy ambience for a proper adda with your loved ones or if you just want to drop in for a cup of coffee all alone listening to some good music and a book to read well Courting Coffees is the place for you with pocket friendly options(though they have few to opt for in their card).The coffee was good , sandwiches with cheese,ham and chicken was tasty.Even the salad was good enough.
The spicy guava was little different to taste (something innovative they made)... Will definitely recommend people to visit with friends ...

The couple of dishes I had were strictly average. I was happy to see garlic bread with sundried tomatoes feature on the menu and it was good by virtue of the ingredients. The all day veg bowl was a weird one (I chose a quinoa base). There wasn't much flavor in the dish. The quinoa was bland and too wet, mushrooms and veggies lacked seasoning, the paneer/tofu too acidic and there was also too much of it. While I still love the name of this cafe, the food won't be memorable.

Its a cute and small restaurant, divided into 2 parts... one is like any other restaurant with normal chairs with  dining tables, and the other is the library section where you can sit and spread your legs comfartbly while reading and consuming whatever you order.
We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and 2 green apple soda. Pizza was good enough to keep cravings at bay for a while. Green apple soda was good too.
The ambience was calming and made relax well so more marks for that. I am definitely gonna recommend this restaurant to others...Will visit again soon!! :)
And next time, i will get a seat for myself in the library section! :P

This place closes at 9:30, not at 10. They refuse to take orders. I had to beg them to take an order at 9:35, the chef gave me looks and begrudgingly agreed to make soup. 

Coming to the soup, it’s Knorr, with a bit of chicken and butter added to it. I’m not joking. This place actually served me that. Avoid at all costs.

From the manu their iced americano is a must try for any coffee lover. Chicken and egg sandwich with hung curd tastes fantastic. Soups and BBQ chicken pizza also goes very well with adda with friends. In quick time this has become my most loved cafe in the salt lake area !!

Honestly, I just go there for the coffee. The place doesn't get crowded. Perfect place to relax n talk to someone over a coffee.  The name is 100% justifiable. Although the pizza was kind of a let down. The crust was too hard. The staffs are very cooperative n well behaved.

Went there with my friends for lunch. Located in my neighbourhood, right opposite ICICI bank near 8 no. Island. A nice place with really cute decor, this is divided into different sections. A place to sit and have coffees, a kids play area, a room full of books and a few indoor games where you can sit and relax, like that. Although as the name suggests that it is a coffee shop, it offers several meal options as well. We ordered a non veg pasta dish, a pizza and lasagne. The food was overall nice, though the pizza crust was a bit dry. The ambiance is really nice, and gives a very homey feel. The only thing I feel they should improve is their playlist, but other than that, we had a nice experience.

They also have a separate room where the seating is on cushions on the floor and there are board games and books to read for those who want. We ordered chicken omelette, Sandwiches and juice all of which were satisfactory. Overall, an average hangout spot.

Visited this place accidentally today after pandal hopping in salt lake. Had to wait for the car to come from the parking area and thought of grabbing a beverage here. It seemed to be a very small coffee house from outside but as we (my elder sis and my 1yr old niece) got in the café we got to know it also has a kids room and then we got to know it's spacious inside with 3 different rooms designed for people of all age - kids, youth and elders. 
Ambience was not so great but decent, the concept though was innovative for me (esp the kids room) 
In food we had ordered a mixed sauce pasta and a mushroom omlette, both tatsed yumm!! 
In beverage we had cold coffee and strawberry milkshake and again both were yumm (esp. The cold coffee, one of the bests I have had) 
Staff were cordial and I would love to visit it again and this time with friends to explore more out here.
I would give it a 4/5 rating.

One of the prettiest places i have been to in recent times
The cafe is a bit small but cute
It has 2 rooms, one for playing games and reading books, one to sit
Played uno 😍😍
The staff is really good
Coming to food
Ordered pancakes with maple syrup and fruits- it tasted really good
Non veg lasagna- one of the best i have ever tasted, it was almost perfect(i have only jad lasagna 3 times, so based on that)
Waffles with chocolate sauce which not only tasted good, looked amazing
Deducted .5 for a bit late service , though its a good thing as you can be sure, everything is fresh, but it was just us in the restaurant, if it was full, it may have taken even more time.

During our usual visit to the bank,we noticed this place right ,opposite it and decided to give it a try! Ambience-smally and cozy! 
What made our experience horrible was the server... On entering his attitude was so unwelcoming,I could see him rolling his eye without any reason! Cold and weird,he was the spoiler.
We called for a masala chaas and he told us it was not there and they don't make it at all but it was still a part of their menu. We settled for a strawberry shake which was really well made.
Next was a chicken steak with a overpowering taste of rosemary and shabby looking soggy veggies. To top it off the mashed potatoeswas more of a aloo bharta with Indian spices*(you do expect proper mash with a continental dish). We decided to leave with an unpleasant experience.
PS.. hiring people who would do their jobs with a little more interest would do them wonders!We were not served water and on asking for it he smashed 2 glasses on table and left without filling it.

A place where you get warm welcome from the owners and the brightly lit cafe is just what evryone needs in midst of our hectic lives. Not to forget the food- the creamy cheese pasta, chicken platter, hot chocolate, cheese garlic bread, lasagne.....yummmm. & the music here will definitely take you back to the essence of an English cafe. They also have this whole creative space for you as well. So if u just wanna sip coffee with ur buddies trying to invent some crazy idea for ur new project, they have a room for you as well. To sum it up- whether u r tired of ur day at work or just wanna hang out with ur friends, this is the place to be. Bring along ur kids too... they have a play area as well😇

The staff was very friendly, and was allowed to customize one of their shakes. When the shake didn't turn out to be meet expectations because it lacked a certain taste and consist, they made a new one for us, and it was pretty good.
A good place, with well made shakes and coffee

Though the combos offer was Grt but it was never mentioned that there is no choice for beverage. 
The coffee was good, the sandwich was well stuffed and delicious. 
Yet I felt something which should not be ever happen with anyone. The etiquette was missing. The service staff was behaving as if he was forced to work. 
At first I ignored it but later I got to know the reason behind such cold behavior is bcoz of my appearance. 
Coming back from work my dress was a little ruffled and it looked a little shabby which became the reason I was getting weird stares and cold behavior. 
I was somewhat disappointed that such behaviors too happen..
Being from hospitality department I clearly felt that the etiquette needs to improve. 
I hope the next visit will be a little better.

I liked the amobience ! Perod and the nice couches with Tintin and A sterix and books thrown in . If you have time to kill or want to lazy around with friends ...this is the place .

I tried the grilled chicken platter and was pleasantly surprised at the quantity and the taste .

Though my coffee was a bit on the cold side !

Keep improving and you have a winner !

Quaint little cafes are running the show in Kolkata and all over India, and despite its growing popularity it never seems to reach the saturation point. Courting coffees is another dainty cafe located at Sector 2, Saltlake. You might have even missed it completely while en route City Centre 1 as it doesn't boast of an eye catching welcome board. However, when you get in it is a different story altogether. 

The place is divided into two portions. One is where you will find the regular seating arrangements with 4-5 tables placed in neatly, and a rather small collection of bakery goods counter in front of you. The other half is where things go uphill. That 'Aadi Bangali' feeling when you lie down on a neat and tidy couch on a Sunday evening with a bookshelf ranging from 'Soviete Tintin' to Paulo Coelho's Alchemist staring right back at you. This place is few notches above other cafes in Salt Lake as you can visit this place alone and spend leisure time with quality food and books to entertain you or you can gather your closest friends and have one of those sorted evenings together. 

Coming to the food, you should not expect it to be any different with the sandwiches and burgers almost sounding same as anywhere. However, the quality and taste will not disappoint you. The Non-Veg Sandwich will impress you if you are a fan of grilled sandwiches having a scrumptious amount of crunch in it. Filled in with cheese and ham it tasted one of a kind. The Non-Veg Burrito Wrap is where things went wrong for us as the inclusion of Rajma didn't quite help our cause. However, the Thick Banana Shake did contemplate for it as it was delicious and knocked out our hunger for more. To draw the curtains you could always take the Waffle with Maple Syrup where every inch of the small squares were filled with Maple syrup served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

The place lures you in with utmost ease, and let you ease down for a while with food and thoughts being the only two thing in your mind.

"Homely" the first word that comes to mind once you step inside. They have chair seatings and also the mattress with small tables with cushions. The décor is very attractive with small potted plants, bookshelves with books on sale, board games. The staff are very courteous.
Coming to food we took green apple soda which was really great. The chicken platter was okayish, the chicken lasagna was great. We had icecream with waffles for dessert and it had us craving for some more.
Price is worth the quantity and quality. Would love to recommend the place. Definitely coming back.

Located in sector 2, came across a lot of positive reviews for this place hence thought of visiting it. This place is orange. The sitting arrangements are quite uncomfortable so a thumbs down for it. Coming to the beverages, ordered a cappuccino and a hot chocolate and while serving it, the staff there spilled almost the half of cappuccino on the saucer and what he asked was, "shall i replace it?" Dude, i wont have it from the saucer. Poor service from the staff. Also, the hot chocolate was extremely sweet which on replacement tasted equally bad. Coming to the food, ordered a egg cheese sandwich and a grilled paneer platter. The taste was very basic and didn't meet the expectations as we thought from reading the review. All in all, this place requires a lot of modifications in terms of staff, food and sitting arrangements as well. Pocket pinch? Yeab, comparing with the quality of the food i wont pay 200 odd bucks for a basic egg cheese sandwich.

Located near 8 no. island in Salt Lake, this cafe is new and fresh. I went there on a fine Sunday evening and I must say that the owner has used the space very smartly. The ambience and decor is nice and the place looks damn clean. Now coming to the main area-The Food. Me and my partner ordered a regular Mocha and Latte and it was disappointing. The coffee was too bland. The food also followed the same trend. We ordered one plate of non-veg pasta and it was expensive. The quantity was too less and the taste again not memorable. The service is good. All in all the place is good but they can improve the food, and I guess that is important.

Nice decor, reasonable prices.
Wouldn't recommend the hot chocolate, was basically watered down Hershey's syrup.
Virgin mojito was decent.
The real star was the grilled chicken platter which had a decent amount of grilled chicken, mashed potatoes and veggies and was the right amount of cheesy.
The barbecue pizza was good too. 
Would 3.5/5 recommend.

A wonderful little cafe tucked inside a residential neighborhood in Salt Lake. The cafe has 3 sections PLUS a kids zone. The front has normal 4 seater tables numbering about 5 the room next to that has ground level seating where you can sit and have the best addas possible and tucked away in the back is a room where .... if you want you can have a session of corporate trainings etc with a complete AV set up.The menu is eclectic.... and extremely interesting... the quantity excellent. the teas are awesome and I am told by my fellow diners that the hot chocolate is unparalleled in the city.... this from someone who lives and breathes chocolate is high praise indeed... 

I would return several times over

The place has just the perfect amount of serenity to offer. A very quiet place with not much of a fuss and everything. The apt coffee shop one can say. If one wishes to relax his/her mind.. Go for the place.. The staff were kind too. Coming to the food, the sandwiches we ordered was wholesome and satiating our taste buds. We ordered a mushroom cheese and a ham cheese sandwich. Next coming to coffee, we had a cup of cappuccino and Mocha! Mocha was extremely delightful and perfect with that chocolaty flavour. Next in the menu was pizza which I felt was not upto the mark. All in all this place could be given a visit.
Thank you.

One of the loveliest cafes in Salt Lake offering delicious cafe food ranging from Continental like pizza, pasta, lasagne to burrito wraps, omelettes, burgers, desserts such as pancakes, waffles and even beverages like healthy protein shakes, mocktails, juices and of course coffee.
Tried their Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie and Non Veg Sandwich (like many of their items the sandwiches are customisable according to one's choice) with chicken filling. 
The smoothie was so very refreshing that it cools your mind and body right down to your soul. For the chicken sandwich I'd opted for brown bread with a base of creamy cheese. The tray of four freshly-made sandwiches accompanied with ketchup is priced at INR 175 but totally makes up for their freshness, crisp breads and the overall delicious taste.
A thumbs up to Courting Coffees for offering such lovely food, a soothing music-filled ambiance and also a pleasant interior with a dainty decor of pretty handpainted tea kettles, candles, tea box, coffe mug etc. A must visit for cafe-goers.

For the people like us who stay pretty away from south Kolkata are not very fortunate to have cafes nearby. But thankfully now there is pretty good no. Of cafes started their journey in saltlake area. And Courting Coffees is one of them.

Location:
___________

It is in sector 2, tank no. 9, to be more precise start your journey from the auto stand of baisakhi at karunamoyee. Walk in the same route of karunamoyee- baisakhi. Just do not take any bend, it is on the right hand side , 10 mins walking distance.

Decoration:
_____________

A small well decorated cafe. They have two small rooms. One is for like sit on matters , you will have book there also. A perfect place for book lover and hanging with friends. The other room have a small place having table chair sitting arrangement.
What will draw you attention- lovely stickers of customer reviews on wall, hanging chain bell, wall decoration.

Food & Beverages:
______________________

Now coming to the main segment here. Let's start with the beverages first.

© Beverages:
✓ Cappuccino - very very nice one. We took the regular one.
✓ Watermelon Smoothie: owsum one. There is no addition of extra sugar. You will get pure watermelon smoothie that what I loved most.
✓ Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie: we were little bit confused that how it will taste, expectation was like it will be like normal banana shake. But they proved us wrong. The taste was just excellent. Loved it.
✓ Green Apple Soda: I would say a perfect refreshner in the pretty humid day. That was owsum one. Chilled, taste superb.
✓ Spicy Guava : Another mocktail and another superb one. The blend of guava and the spice of chilli was just owssum.

© Food:
___________

Only able to taste couple of items. And we were satisfied enough and loved it totally.

✓ Chicken Lasange: when we ordered this they said it will take 20 mins minimum to prepare it. And when we tasted it we realized it just worth it. The taste of chopped chicken with cheese baked was just owssum. No doubt one of the best lasange I have ever had.

✓ chicken salad: we were little bit confused that which ingredient will be better for the salad. And thanks to the chef , he came suggested us the items as per our taste and the result is just superb. 

Base - lattuce and cucumber
Accompaniment- grilled chicken + ham ( ham we took additional ,that was charable)
Dressing- lemon vinigar and olive oil

We thought of taking meyonis as a dressing, as per chef recommendation we tried else, and it was owsum.

So, the overall experience was pretty good. We love each bite, each sip there. Hospitality is the another point which need the mention also.

All that cost INR 1388 for two.

To Management: the decor, the food all were just lovely :) keep maintain your quality and grow more. Cheers !!!!

It was all of a sudden visit to this place. We ordered cappuccino, iced mocha and sandwich that is completely of our choice. We can make our own sandwich so we chose brown bread with cheese base and ham in the filling. Well considering the food,it was like the best ever sandwich. But, the cappuccino and the iced mocha could have been a lot better..they were not up to the mark. Considering it's a coffee shop..they need to take care of the main priority.. I will definitely suggest everyone to try the ham sandwich here for once. Ambience was pretty good. Waiters could have been a bit friendlier and prices..they need to be a bit pocket friendly....!

Sometimes, a rather quiet and comfortable cafe is needed to sit aloof and read a few books and have some amazing food and relax. With a section that has mattresses on the floor to give a home level of comfort, is every lazybum's desire. They also have a sitting area, but who cares!
The menu is simple, offers equal veg and non veg options.
We had peach ice tea and green apple soda, simple and nice.
Burrito wrap with kidney beans and boiled veggies, was very good.
Veg grilled platter with cottage cheese served with mashed potatoes and cheesy mushroom sauce, amazing it was.
Garlic bread with loads of cheese was just perfect.
Spaghetti in creamy pesto with mushrooms was again, very good.
Was satisfied with the food and the service and most importantly, the feel of the place, which is quite relaxing.

Decided to write this review after my 3rd visit :) By Delphi's method of best of 3 ...

Well back to the business of the review. We had heard of this joint from a local friend and tried out for a quick bite and coffee.. Ambience is cool and laid back. Staff helpful but service is a tad slow. We ordered Omelettes with chicken n Ham in both the visits with coffee and smoothie to chase it down.. Food was good. The portion good but the grilled veggies could have been a lil more juicy. 

Yesterday we tried grilled fish (Fish Platter). The fish was grilled okay and properly flaky, tasted okay but could have been better. Portion of fish was very generous (that was a big plus). The grilled veggies continued to be less succulent. The mashed potato tasted good but was noticeably lumpy. The white sauce definitely needed a major improvement. it looked and tasted as if flour was in excess or milk /butter/cream was wanting. 

Overall a place to be explored further and I would love to be back for the rest of the items on the menu :)

We ordered chocolate shake, peanut butter and banana smoothie (quite interesting!), chicken platter and waffle ice cream. Thanks and all the very best to the couple for this entrepreneurial venture! With the proposed expansion of space and more seats, I am pretty sure there will be many more visitors in this already crowded cafe.

It is located near 8 no. tank in Salt Lake. They have 3 rooms. One filled with tables, next one decorated with couches and 3rd one for kids.
Decorationwise this place is pretty good. The cafe has very calm and peaceful ambience.
Now come to food....I went there on sunday. I wanted to try chicken lasagne. We also decided to try masala tea. But they didn't have any one of them.
Then we ordered Darjeeling tea and Assam Tea, chicken creamy chess pasta and chicken wrap. The wrap had a very weird taste. Pasta was good comparatively.
All the staffs are friendly. But management should look into the availability of the foods that are listed in the menu.
With few issues overall it's a good place.

Went with my girls group. The place is a little tough to locate but it is warm and cozy. 
The interiors is decent. If u are a book lover, you will like the place as they have good collection of books. However, the games are very very limited with chess, scrabble and jenga. If they increase the number of games, I guess it will make the people spend more time esp in groups. 
The food is okayish, the quality can be improved. We ordered a pizza, mixed sauce pasta and peanut butter banana shake and only pasta is worth eating. 
The staff is polite but little inexperienced. 

With a little more of an effort the cafe will be able to live up to its rating of 4.

I went to this cafe along with my wife. This is located just near to 8 no. water tank Saltlake. We ordered two smoothies- Mango and Strawberry. Along with that we ordered one Non veg salad and Non veg platter.

In non-veg salad you have to specify the add ons so we asked for grilled chicken, mayo sauce and chick peas along with lettuce,cucumber,bell pepper. They also provided us with a slice of bread.This dish was pretty ordinary as it had less chicken,less vegetables. It had more cabbage keaves and lettuce.
In non-veg platter we opted for grilled chicken which was served along with mashed potato and sauted vegetables. This was really nice because the chicken was very well grilled and tender enough for our tooth.

Interiors are really well decorated and lit up. This place has an entire room which has books and games to give you company. Seating arrangements should be made more comfortable.

Service really needs an improvement as they seemed to be under-staffed. One man was managing everything from taking orders,cleaning table and serving food.

The moment I entered this beautiful café, located at Saltlake, Sec II, I knew it was love at first sight! Exuding a calm and soothing vibe, this café is unlike any of the jazzy cafés that you find everywhere in Kolkata. Done up in shades of white and orange, this is one café where you would want to go on a rainy afternoon and enjoy a cup of hot coffee with some books. Perfect ambience for the ones seeking some solace from the hustle bustle of the city.

So how did I come across this beautiful place? Subham Ghosh and I had been invited here to try out their Summer Special Menu which includes a range of chillers and coolers, and also some very delicious grub.

Now, on entering the café, it might appear small, but let me tell you, surprisingly this place has 4 different sections - one room for gatherings and parties with floor seating, another room for conferences and meetings, a specially stocked room for kiddies, and ofcourse the main seating area.

I could go on and on about how beautiful I found this café to be, some weird "love at first sight" connection, but now I'll start talking about the food, which like the ambience will surely impress you.

So we started our brunch with Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie and Mango Smoothie. Needless to say both of them tasted amazing. Honestly, I had never tried the peanut butter and banana combination, but hey, it was soooooo good! If you want to surprise yourself, do try this one. Coming to the Mango Smoothie, it was perfect! We also tried the Green Apple Cooler which has a soda base, so full marks for the added zing and fizz! It was really very refreshing.

Moving on to the main course, we were served with the CoCo Special Non-veg Pizza first. This was specially made for us, as CoCo Special is a Veg Pizza. Now this looked so colourful and appealing. Having a multi-grain crust, this one's for all the health food junkies. But the taste isn't compromised. The toppings consisted of bell peppers, olives and chunks of chicken. Totally recommended!

Next up was the Chicken Burger. This was another delight! The patty, which was an in-house preparation, was thick and juicy. The burger was stuffed with lettuce, onions and tomatoes. Totally worth gorging on!

Coming to the showstopper of the afternoon, the Chicken Lasagna!!!!! The look of this made me drool! It was super cheesy and looked sinful. The chicken stuffing was so creamy and tasted so sooo good! It was so well cooked, that everything was literally melting in my mouth with oodles of cheese everywhere, ofcourse! My favourite dish of the afternoon, hands down!!

For desserts, we were served Carrot Cake with Ice-cream, which was specially made for us. The carrot cake surprised me with its rich taste, and paired with the ice-cream, it was definitely a delight to my taste buds!

So with this, we ended our appetizing brunch. The best part of the afternoon? We had the owners, Anirban and Sabitri with us, who were amazing amazing (yes, I've used it twice) hosts! We had a delightful adda session over some really good food.

I really hope they open an outlet in South Kolkata very sooon. Either way I'll be back at this café very soon, be it Saltlake or South Kolkata.

All my love to Team Courting Coffees!

I went here today with my wife and kid. It is an amazing cafe. You don't go to a cafe only to njoy food. We go there for the experience. We had an amazing experience. The color contrast and decor- it's so bright and make you feel cheerful. The welcome by the people over there. The food suggestions, kids corner, Adda zone, conference room- if you don' t call this as experience then what is an experience. If you are confused, the ever smiling owners will come and suggest food and you can trust them blindly. We had a sandwich, mango smoothie, green apple soda , all day bowl. Food quality and quantity- I can sum up in a word -' amazing'.

I am sure I will be frequent visitor to this place. Thanks Anirban and Sabitri for this fantastic cafe and most importantly the experience.

Cafe Courting Coffees is one of the most beautiful cafes in Salt Lake. It has more of homely touch, unlike the quirky and modern cafes these days. I particularly liked the serenity which the place offered, which is hard to find in most places. I was invited here with Nilanjana Bagchi to try the recent inclusions in the menu.

The owners, Anirban and Sabitri, were extremely welcoming and hospitable and I loved the way they took special care of not only us, but of each and every customer present in the cafe. The cafe is divided into four sections - the main dining area, a seperate room for groups and gatherings, a room for meetings and a room specially designed for kids. From juniors to seniors, each and everyone is bound to fall in love with this amazing place.

I was already engrossed in the beauty of this place, when the food as well proved to exceed my expectations. We started with the special summer coolers. The Peanut Banana Smoothie and the Mango Smoothie were perfectly done. The consistency proved to be excellent. What I absolutely loved was the Green Apple Soda, which was chilled, fizzy and refreshing. It definitely proved to be a perfect summer cooler, with an amazing balance of flavours.

We had the Special Non Veg Pizza. The vegetarian version is generally printed in their menu card but the non vegetarian version of it was specially made for us. Any customer can definitely make this request. The pizza had a thick crust multigrain base. The toppings included bell peppers, olives, corn, chicken and onions. The pizza was cheesy and tasted great.

We tried the Chicken Burger next. The patty was prepated in-house. It was moist and well seasoned. The buns were additionally stuffed with a layer of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The burger was amazingly juicy. It is actually a good option for the health conscious people.

My favourite among the entire new menu was the Chicken Lasagna which came next. It was amazingly cheesy. The chicken stuffing was creamy and well cooked. I completely fell in love with this dish.

We had carrot cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. The carrot cake tasted excellent. It was spongy and the sweetness was just perfect ! With vanilla ice cream, it tasted beautiful.

Overall, Cafe Courting Coffees is a hidden gem. The food is surely going to impress everyone. The quality of food is undoubtedly good. The pricing has been made very wisely. The service was pretty fast. I hope they open another outlet in South Calcutta soon, so that I won't need to travel to Salt Lake to try all these amazing dishes.

Breakfast is one kind of a meal which most of the people like us forget to eat. like lunch & dinner this is a very important meal for everyday’s life. ” Courting Coffees ” is a place where you can actually feel the vibe of real meaning of proper breakfast. why i am telling this,well first of all the decoration and vibrant colors will attract you the most, this place is decorated beautifully and the concept is quite impressing. it has different types of rooms, one is where you can sit and enjoy the food.second place which especially i liked the most is a room full of different types of books with comfy floor based sofas & pillows. if you’re a book lover then you should choose this room.another very important part if you’re coming here with your toddlers.there is a small room which is decorated with toys, where your baby can play with the toys. this concept is one of the best one. another room also there but some work is going on process,soon it will be open soon. this p[articular things separate it from other cafe’s and i would recommended please go there and enjoy.

It’s a promising new café, situated just off Salt Lake Island number 8, towards tank number-9. Done up on the ground floor of a residential building, the place provides quite many options. It has a kids’ friendly section, a room for work meetings, a reading room with cozy corners and a few options to pick from the shelves. The place is done up in vibrant natural light during the daytime (Both my visits yes were for breakfasts) and it gives a fresh feel to the morning. The outer common section has comfortable seating and small curio adorn the racks on the sides of the main entrance. The reading room is small and has floor level seating. So if you have a small group for company, the privacy may be lost. But given it be a early weekday morning, and it can be the best place you can spend our time. I Went there for a food tasting event as a member of Panchphoron. The staffs were helpful and friendly.

If you’re looking for a place where you want to have some delicious breakfast,foods you want to eat like Continental and Italian then you have to visit “Courting Cafe”. Courting Cafe is Located within the lanes of Salt Lake Sector 2 . Done up in shades of yellow and orange, this gives the cafe a very brightly lit vibe. Apart from the normal cafe sitting area consisting of tables and chairs there is another area which has cushions for sitting.  That makes a comfortable work-space for individuals. There are big bookshelves lining the walls and filled with many books which you can read. Recently they introduced some cool games which you can access and enjoy through out the time. I was quite impressed by the interiors which they maintained really well. Around 16-21 people can seat and eat together at a time. I was went there with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session. We had a great time.
                                                                ...

Summer is in its peak, but not to worry. Take your friends and family to this place as they have introduced a new bunch of healthy and tasty drinks to energize you. Summer cooler is the name, make a note of it :)

So, what do we get in this menu?

Well, we get the following:
1 - ice tea
2- Virgin Mojito
3- Mix fruit ice-cream scoop
4- Ice cappuccino
5- Mango Madness (milkshake)
6- wonder watermelon (milkshake)
7- cranberry atomic
8- orange atomic (100% healthy and sugar free)
9- Mixed strawberry banana protein smoothie
10- Green Smoothie

I had a very nice experience out there and there are few unique things about this place:
1. The paintings aren't bought from outside, those are drawn by the Host's father-in-law.
2. A separate crèche is there for babies, they have toys and all the staffs, so the baby will have a beautiful time out there.
3. They're coming up with stand-up comedy performance from 4th June,2017 and have plans for arranging karaoke nights as well.
4. Every single person out there is so happy to help you and serve the tastiest food.

Beat the heat and pop in here.....

Thanks to the host Café Courtingcoffees 😊

Happy eating :)

This Cafe draws me back again and again for the mind blowing healthy food options it offers. Visited today evening again to order a customised non-veg salad (bell pepper based with grilled chicken, olive oil, kidney beans and garlic flakes) and Banana peanut butter protein shake. The quantity sufficiently filling for a supper and nutritionally well balanced while ensuring a treat to the taste buds. Warm interactions with the cheerful owners who are open to feedback, courteous staff and the cosy ambience make sure that you keep coming back to the place again and again.

This café is the closest to my place and hence seeing it coming up brought me immense joys. Furthermore, having gone there and savouring the delectable platters added the extra bit of colours. 

This joint has four segments: a kids zone, the seating area, the adda khana and the conference room. 

A frequent visitor to the joint and having tried almost all the items on the menu I'd like to list down my favourites :

All day bowl (non veg), spaghetti , the non veg grilled sandwich, the veg grilled sandwich, grilled chicken, waffles with chocolate syrup and icecream. 

The only one dish I didn't like was the burrito, too sweet a sauce, very bland filling. 

Nevertheless, the owners are lovely people and so are the staffs. A very pocket friendly and homely café.

Just visited the place. Firstly the owner was having some meeting inside the sitting area where ipl was screening. The waiter did not listen to any of our request .Understaffed, inattentive place. Food too low in quantity for even two people. Did not serve water, did not have tissue papers on table. The owner though seemed very poshe and well groomed but the food was not at all up to the mark. Told the server to not to give kidney beans in burrito but he gave, told him to make three slices of it he did not. Then he wanted me to do it. Frustrated to the core. Ruined the evening.

Decided to visit this place after a sudden craving for coffee.
It is located near 8 no tank,a very small and cozy place.
They have one room filled with tables which can seat 4 each while another filled with couches which can seat two each.
It has a nice and calm ambience with this amazing around the globe wallpaper on one side and a corner with books and some beautiful handmade things.
Coming to the food.
We decided to ditch coffee and instead get some real food as most of us were starving.
We ordered the non veg lasagne which they took 20 minutes to prepare. On the plus side it was freshly made and right out of the oven.
The quantity was exceptionally less and it was a whooping 350+taxes ! It wouldn't even fill one person up.
Anyways the lasagne had a lot of vegetable stuffing and very little chicken. But it was tasty so no issue with that. Had a lot of cheese so that's a plus side.
They charge 10% service tax. So the cost went up to 385 and I think it isn't really worth it compared to the quantity.
Overall it's moderately mood.

My first experience with CoCo had been through Swiggy when I had ordered waffles, one with maple syrup, and another with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. Needless to say, one would have to work extra hard to disappoint with those and I was not disappointed.

Shortly afterwards I visited this café in BK block, Salt Lake. It was pretty easy to locate thankfully.
The café feels rather homely on the inside, not too decorated other than the world map on one of the walls.
I asked what was special about the CoCo special cold coffee and was informed it was just cold coffee. 😆
I was then offered chocolate milkshake (which at the time was not on the menu) with ice cream, which I agreed to. And we ordered chicken sandwiches but weren't really asked what kind bread or base we'd prefer. Nonetheless whatever they chose was actually pretty (even surprisingly) great.
The shake though, this may sound like an odd thing to say but maybe a little less chocolate syrup was in order. Or maybe I'm a heretic. Who knows?

I definitely wanna come back for those waffles and fresh this time.

It's nice to have a meeting point close by home, and courting coffees provides just that option for me.  And add to it the fact that it serves breakfast and has a reading corner, and it becomes a perfect place to spend some alone time on home alone days.

It's a promising new cafe, situated just off Salt Lake Island number 8, towards tank number-9. Done up on the ground floor of a residential building, the place provides quite many options. It has a kiddy friendly section, a room for work meetings, a reading room with cozy corners and a few options to pick from the shelves. The place is done up in vibrant natural light during the daytime (Both my visits yes were for breakfasts) and it gives a fresh feel to the morning. The outer common section has comfortable seating and small curio adorn the racks on the sides of the main entrance. The reading room is small and has floor level seating. So if you have a small group for company, the privacy may be lost. But given it be a early weekday morning, and it can be the best place you can spend our time.

Coming to the food on offer, the menu is decent and has a few options. I have tried their mango shake and berry smoothie from the drinks section and both of them have been pretty refreshing. The non veg breakfast platter was disappointing on the day I tried it. The grilled veggies were a dampener and the fruits had just apples on offer. The chicken omelette platter was good comparatively. Served with small cut four slices of bread with butter, a cup of fresh cut fruits (though the menu said grilled veggies) and a thick omelette portion, it was filling.

The staff is helpful and friendly. The mornings hardly had any rush and the service was quick. The management does need to look into the availability of all the items listed in the menu, quite many options wen asked were declined due to lack of availability. Prices are moderate.

With a few issues being sorted, the place does hold a lot of promise. Looking forward to future visits. Hope they can hold on to the feel good feeling.

Happy eating!!!

Went there with lots of hope. First they are hard to locate for a non Salt Lake Resident. The location given in Zomato was wrong.
Food is bottom line average. But the thing struck me, that would make me not to come back here again is what I peeked inside the kitchen. 
Restaurant was almost full, and we got a table near kitchen door. Almost everything could be seen from there. Someone ordered a lime soda maybe. The waiter made it, and tasted it with the straw and asked another to taste it. After both of them are done with it, they gave the same straw to the customer. 
We were disgusted by it, thinking if the same was done to our order. 
Never coming back for sure.

I often visit this café because its atmosphere as "formally elegant “ with separate section and I like the co-working space. Maximum time I go for green fish, sandwich and green tea but I was trying maximum food item of this café. Just one word I can say that food was described as " among the very best in the compare to several cafes” with good reasonable price.  I really recommended this café to spend great time and very thanks for the courting café organizer.

Quantity served for I guess Minions.

Ordered Platter
1. Veg Platter:
     3 Thin chunks Raw Cottage cheese, small portion dried (sukhi sadi) vegetables and a tablespoon of mashed potatoes.... no flavour, no gravy and  no seasoning at all.

2. Chicken Platter
Dry non juicy chicken pieces and similar sides as the veg platter.

Lemon Iced Tea was Okay.

WAY TOO OVERPRICED COMPARED TO THE QUANTITY THEY SERVE.

Money Wasting Experience.

An office snacks party was pending for several weeks and yesterday we got the chance to spend some time over quick snacks in the evening, though we didn't have the time to go out, so we ordered through Swiggy. I only stepped forward and suggested the name of Courting Coffees as it's a relatively new cafe and I heard it's quite promising as well. We ordered - two 6" BBQ Chicken pizzas, one chicken salad, one chicken omelette and one sausage omelette. The omelettes were accompanied with breads and sautéed veggies. According to me, the omelettes with that side of sautéed veggies were the best part of this entire meal. They were soothing to taste and perfectly tossed. The omelettes had generous filling of Chicken or sausages respectively. The salad was kinda okayish and the quantity was pretty on the lower side, I opted for some extra boiled corn which I guess was mixed with the salad itself and overall the balance of the elements were optimum. Now coming to the crux of the matter. When you order two 6" pizzas what do you expect? You expect two packets of two whole round pizzas. Here I got two boxes, each having 3 slices of pizzas, when I joined them, I got one single round pizza. But hey, I had ordered two pizzas and paid INR 460 for that. But in the end, we found that whatever they had delivered, you can't consume too many slices of this pizza, in fact we had to trash couple of pieces. The base was hard like a rock and tasted weird when you bite in, the toppings were loose and were falling off. Overall, I was quite embarrassed since my colleagues said this was the worst recommendation I had made till date!! That's not something I am used to hear. And yes, I will never again spend my money on this place again. Hope they will keep working hard and improve in the near future.

Cheers!

A new joint in Salt Lake which opens quite early in the morning and is perfect for ordering breakfast.When I checked the menu,they offer a lot of customisation but at the final product none are followed.
I ordered for a chicken sandwich in multigrain bread,mustard sauce,cheese base and what I recieved was a chicken salad sandwich with mayo and kasundi in brown bread.The taste was very nice and I don't have any complaints against it,but please don't fool customers.When you have two seperate otions brown and multigrain bread,how can you provide the same bread for both the cases.Just simply change the name of the item,instead of putting so may options and then finally sending what you actually want.
Also ordered for a cheese omlette,and ridiculously they put sliced apples on a hot omlette in the same foil pack.How can a person eat hot apples with an egg smell?
Please take extra packing charge if you want but pack the food sp that its edible.
Again the same problem of customisation in this item too.They asked for bread with jam or butter,but what came was a piece of grilled brown bread cut in four without any kind of condiments on it.
I do not have problem with any of the food items' taste and the rating is completely for the taste but the other 2 points deducted are for fooling customers with customisations and ridiculous packing.

Apart from the normal cafe sitting area consisting of tables and chairs there is another area which has cushions for sitting. That makes a comfortable workspace for individuals. There are big bookshelves lining the walls and filled with many books which you can read. There are a few games too. I liked the decor very much :-). Went there to catch up with a friend of mine and since we had limited time we just ordered some waffles with maple syrup and fruit. We played Scrabble while the order arrived. Service is kinda slow. The waffles were done nicely,although they could have been a little less soggy. Prices are moderate to high. Cosy ambience for quality time to be spent with friends and family :-)

Cafes are supposed to be a place where you can just sit and catch up. This is one place which actually provides that kind of environment. An extra rating just for that. Interiors are quirky. Food is good. Try the pesto pasta.. It's really well made.

When McDonald's are giving 2 pancakes at 60, why would people pay 120 for 3.... & the rest of the food too, i think.... Except the Chicken platter... It was really good.... Nice experience :)

Great ambience. A number of good dishes. Sandwiches and Omelettes are good. Waffles and pancakes are average. The Coco special cold coffee is overpriced with nothing special about it. It's plain and simple basic cold coffee.

Located near Island No 8, it a decent place with appreciable decor. The service is a bit slow, but food is good enough. We had Chocolate milkshake due to non-availability of Mango Milkshake which was ok.The waffles Witg Chocolate sauce was great and the grilled chicken platter was elegantly served, with fresh exotic vegetables.

Went there for a late lunch with a friend of mine. It looks like a very small cafe type from outside but once you enter, its nice and cosy. On the left hand side, another door makes way for a different kind of seating arrangement that includes like a ground-sofa type where you can play all sort of board games. We didn't sit there, we sat somewhere else. Coming back to the food, we ordered:
• Americano ( large ): it tastes good.
• lemon iced tea: originally I asked for vanilla iced tea but they were out of it, so I had to settle for this one. It tastes good, not too sweet and it certainly has the taste of tea.
• omelette with sausage, brown toasted bread and vegetables: really loved the omelette, i just wish the bread was bigger. Vegetables were good.
• non veg salad with ham, cheesy cream sauce with all vegetables: this one was really good! Loved it.
• non veg spaghetti with cheesy cream and grilled chicken: a bit overcooked but still delicious. 
• pancakes with maple syrup and fruits: this one was absolutely amazing. They served only watermelons as fruits, wish they served more fruits of different varities.

However, at the end they had some problem the card swiper and it took a lot of time. But we ended up paying by cash. All of this costed rs897. A bit expensive. Will be coming back soon.

Well I am not personally so fond of cafes but this place surely changed my mind. This is truly one of the best places I have been. I tried the non veg all day bowl it was healthy, tasty as well as filling. They also changed my spaggati to rice on request. The food was very fresh. The staff is very friendly too. I had also got mini red velvet cupcakes and I loved those. I would love to go there again.

The quality and quantity of food needs to be improved.
The waffles were delicious though.

Courting means to woo, and this is exactly what u shouldn't be expecting from this place or at least from the staff here..
If 'service with smile' is what you are looking for, then this isn't the place for you. So does that mean the staff was rude? No, absolutely not. Was the staff warm and welcoming? Again No! 
They were basically... Indifferent.
Ambience is cozy, neat and very homely (infact they have turned an apartment into a cafe).
Moving on to food, here's what we ordered:
Hot Cappuccino - 5/10
Iced Cappuccino - 5/10
Veg. Sandwich - 7.5/10
Penne Arrabiata - Quite delicious - 9/10
Total Bill - INR 578

So if you are planning a casual get together with your pals, then I would definitely recommend this place. On the other hand if you wanna "Court" your girlfriend...Then not so much!

My husband and I are always on the look-out for new cafes in the city, where we can sit and chat over a steaming cuppa and some quick bites. On our way back from office, we noticed this new place ( near Tank no 8).

Very few places in Kolkata serve waffles, and I am a huge waffles fan. So one Sunday, to satiate my sudden waffles craving, we ended up here. I ordered waffles with ice cream and fruits, and my husband ordered a peach iced tea.

The ambience seemed a little confused, to be frank - parts of it colourful and bohemian, parts of it dark and formal.

The iced tea was served in a literally massive mason jar (the kind, when you finish off, will be followed by a mandatory visit to the loo), and was a little too sweet for my taste. 

The waffles, though, were delicious. The portion was more than generous, freshly made, with powdered sugar sprinkled on top, and surrounded by a huge dollop of ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Every bite was worth the money. 

Don't know about the other dishes, but since this is the only place nearby which serves waffles, I'll be coming back!!

This little cafe is in situated in Saltlake, Sector 2.It is one of those places where you can laze around without looking at the clock and spend an entire evening with your friends.
You can sit and dine or opt for  those dainty mattresses and pick up any story or comic book and enjoy your meal
Now coming to the food.
•Banana berry smoothie- It was thick creamy and pulpy. 
•Non-veg Burrito Wrap- I  honestly did not really like the taste of this. I have issues with Rajma and anything related to it.
•Non-Veg Sandwich: The sandwich was well toasted and had the right amount of crunch in it . Unlike other sandwiches or  subs the bread was coated with hung curd which made it irresistible. The presentation was pretty good as well.
•Waffles with maple syrup- I can't even begin to describe how delicious it was. The maple syrup filling in those little squares and with a vanilla scoop to accompany it, though the upper crust was a tad firm than I personally like.

Seconds away from Tank no. 8, the place is a charming little cafe that left us delighted.
There are separate areas for every purpose- a kids' play zone, an adda zone with a reading space, a space for office meetings and of course the traditional cafe with an open kitchen.
We went on Holi, and were surprised with complimentary red velvet mini cupcakes.
We ordered:
-Bacon salad with our choice of extras
-Chicken sausage salad.
The salads were distinct in flavour and their meat is so well marinated that it leaves you craving for more. :P
-Hot chocolate (since we had heard that they serve one of the best ones in town) : it was heaven. :') No kidding.
- Berry and banana smoothie- served in a pretty little mason jar and it tasted brilliant with it's perfectly balanced sweetness.

They charge 10% tax overall. And i wish their salad quantity was a little more.
But it's definitely a place worth visiting again and again. :)

A cozy cafe topped with warm vibes of the staff.
The omlette with sausage is a must try - mouth melting! And the waffles ! In with the fancy trend of cozy sitting arrangements accompanied with floor games & books for the readers. Also, a separate space available for formal/informal gatherings. First time visit and we got treated to conplimentary 'paan- shot' for it was Holi! They sure know how to keep customers happy :)
It could be the Central Perk for your gang!

Offers a variety range of snacks and drinks. Quite pocket friendly. We tried pancakes, waffles, lemon ice tea, grilled barbeque chicken platter and expresso. Pancakes needs improvement. In the end a cool place to hangout with friends !

Located near tank no.9 in saltlake. A small cafe perfect for hangouts. Went with a friend,had iced cappuccino, cold coffee and spaghetti bowl( with grilled chicken). I must say the spaghetti bowl was delicious,the ingredients were fresh as well. The coffee had a roasted smell. 
The interior was simple yet attractive. Loved the lights hanging from top. The waiter was really nice too.
Gonna visit again :)

Another coffee shop in the heart of salt lake which promises a good ambience and service. Loved the simple interior with white and orange colour motif. The table and chair sets are unique and actually saves a lot of space. The seating arrangement on the floor is appropriate for a group Adda session. The elegant decor idea shows the taste of the makers. We ordered cheese garlic bread and I must say it was yummy. Would love to visit the cafe once again to try the non veg food items. Overall a nice experience.

Extremely mismanaged. Broccoli served was not fresh one . When complained then they gave fresh vegetables which clearly means that if something is left over and is not fresh then they push it first . Also , 2 weeks back toot husband had ordered for lunch bowl and they said they can only provide with Sphagetti  and even today the same was iterated. Well , if u can't keep stocks then remove this items from the menu. First they served the bowl without vegetables then the chicken in the bowl was also served cold . When I finished my food then they gave the garlic bread which was ordered first . Then came the vegetables which were actually supposed to be served with the Lunch Bowl. Well only cushions and mattresses will not be a winning factor . You guys need to improve a lot .

Located in Sector 2 Salt Lake, Courting Coffees is a brilliant place to hang out. Having an amazing ambience and a soothing decor, with amicable staffs, this place is definitely a must try. They have a cool seating arrangements, with books and a room with cushions and mattresses where you can chit chat with your dear ones in full comfort. We had vanilla iced tea and cold coffee - both were refreshing. Then we had a spaghetti bowl, it was full of flavours. Finally we finished our food crusade with pancakes which fluffy, delicious and served hot. Indeed Courting Coffees is a must try. Good Job! Highly recommended.

Had been hearing about this place for quite sometime, so checked it out one evening. Very subtle and nice ambience, however don't be fooled by the parking space inside, there is none. One has to park their car outside, because it's someone's private parking. Coming to food, we had ordered Greek salad pizza, waffles with maple syrup, lemon green tea, peach tea and cappuccino. The pizza and tea was good. The staff takes their own sweet time to serve.

Was indeed really looking forward to this place for breakfast. Just went there today morning. We ordered for Pancakes, Waffles, Pasta, Garlic Bread with Cheese and Chocolate Smoothie.
There was a delay in the service. We literally waited there for an hour and a half just to have breakfast.
The pancakes weren't that great however the rest of the items were comparatively better.
The items are fairly priced.
The overall experience was also not that great!

Edit 1:
So we went to this place again and we were very dissappointed though they earlier ensured of better service.
This time we ordered Veg Buritto and Pizza, and the base of the buritto (chapatti) was uncooked. Upon complainting the waiter said this is how it is suppose to be.
I mean who serves half cooked food?
VERY DISSAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!

This quaint little cafe is the latest addition to our Salt Lake area. Done in shades of bright orange. The place is brightly lit. They have utilised a portion to a sit down place and the other bit holds tables and chairs. The menu is elaborate. Tried only their peanut butter banana shake and their chocolate shake. It was excellent! Prices are not very cheap not out of reach. Mildly on the higher side. They have wi-fi and parking!

Thrilled to finally have a cafe so near  my home, I visited this place with my mom a week back.. The decor is truly amazing,so thumbs up to that👍. Now coming to the food.. We'd ordered Penne Pasta with pesto sauce, cupcakes, cappuccino and Darjeeling tea. The pasta was perfect and so were the cupcakes.. I was a bit disappointed with the beverages though.. The tea seemed to me a bit on the blander side and lacked the typical flavour of Darjeeling tea and the cappuccino could have been better.. However, the ambience and the courteousness of the staff made up for it all😊... Would definitely visit again

This lovely café has opened up near island 8, opposite ICICI bank. It was delight for me to find a cafe open doors so near my home and so I ended up there on the first week.
The first thing that catches your eye is the decor of the place. Its done in lively orange and dark wood. There are rooms for different purposes. There's a normal seating area, a perfect lounge-like area complete with a mini library and board games collection, a conference room and a kid's room.
The staff are really courteous and helpful. They showed us around and made us feel at home.
Coming to food, I really liked the waffles. And their sandwiches are finger-licking good. The pastas are decent. They have a lot of healthy choices in their menu and there's a kid-friendly food section too. Their coffees are at par with the coffee quality of au bon pain - great quality. And tea is decent.
Overall, I am really happy with their service and the homely place, which is why I keep going there often. But I'd like to suggest them to improve their food and bakery section; I could easily give a 5 rating.

This little cafe has recently opened in the lanes of Saltlake. It is located in Sector 2 opposite the ICICI Bank outlet.
The cafe has a very young vibe going on. There is an option of sitting in the normal table and chairs or there is an option of sitting on mattresses which are extremely comfortable and cool. 
You can play board games and read a book while you sip your coffee. The serve their food very quickly.
We had ordered a chicken sandwich which was extremely tasty. The brown breads were very soft and the chicken filling was quite rich in flavours.
We had also ordered a chocolate waffle which was mouth watering.
The place is easy on the pocket and is surely recommended:)

Went deliberately to check out this place after going through the reviews in Zomato. A cosy place to sit ofcourse and ordered chocolate sauce Waffles and a cheese masala omelette. The omelette lacked salt and masala as well according to my taste buds and the waffle too was not that worth. In an area like Salt Lake, Team Courting Coffees should gear up in terms of taste definitely in my opinion :)

Valentine’s Day Special at Cafe Courting Coffees, Salt Lake..!

An off-beat cafe, where food and beverages are exemplary, a homely place which gives you the comfort and leisure, a laid back ambiance which helps you keep relaxed. Come celebrate the week of love and Valentine’s Day at Courting Coffees, with a specially curated menu for the lovers. My personal recommendation would be ‘Brain Freezer’ and ‘Grilling Questions’.

This place is cute and reminds you of European cafe's. The menu is good with different kinds of beverages as well. Food is good too. I went here for breakfast with a friend and we ordered a cheese omelette, waffle, mocha (as they were out of masala tea which I ordered in the first place) and a shake. The portion size of the dishes are good too. The presentation of the dishes could be better. All in all it's a good place to try out.

ধুকতেই আপ্যায়ন , মনে করিয়ে দিল নিজের কোন আত্মীয়ের  বাড়িতে প্রথম আসার কথা । সকল কর্মচারী দের ব্যাবহার অত্যন্ত ভালো এবং সহজগিতা মুলক । বাইরে থেকে দেখে বোঝা না গেলেও ভেতরে বেশ পরিমান মত জায়গা আছে , এবং সেগুলি বিশেষ কাজের জন্য বরাদ্দ করে রাখা । ধুকতেই প্রথমে রোজকার চলতি পথের মানুষের জন্য চেয়ার টেবিলের ব্যাবস্থা । ঠিক তার পাশেই মাটিতে বসে গদির ওপর হেলান দিয়ে আরাম করে পা ছড়িয়ে আড্ডা দিতে দিতে কফি খাওয়ার জন্য  আলাদা ব্যাবস্থা , সাথে কিছু ভালই বই সহযোগিতার হাত বারিয়ে রেখেছে । এছাড়াও ভেতরে আরও দুটি ঘর বিশেষ কাজের জন্য বরাদ্দ রয়েছে , প্রয়োজন অনুযায়ী ব্যাবহারের জন্য । যার একটিতে বসে ইন্টারনেট করার সুব্যাবস্থা আছে । ধুকতেই অর্ধেক ক্লান্তি সন্তুর ভুলিয়ে দিয়েছিল বাকিটার দায়িত্ব যথাযথ ভাবে পালন করলো ক্যাপাচিনো ।

মন শান্ত হওয়ার পর পালা পেটের , অভিজানের শুরু হল বালসামিক স্যান্ডুইচ সাথের বারবি কিউ মেয়নিস সাথে লেটুস আর পেঁয়াজ এর স্যালড দিয়ে । এরপর পালা চকলেট সস সাথে কিছু টাটকা ফল দিয়ে ওয়াফলে এবং স্ফাগেতি আগ্লই ওলিও , যা একাধারে স্বর্গীয় স্বাদ এবং  মান বহন করছে । আট থেকে আসি সবার ভালো লাগতে বাধ্য । 

প্যান কেকর সাথে চকলেট সিরাপ এবং  ফল , হালকার ওপর টিফিন সারার জন্য আদর্শ । ধারা অব্যাহত রাখতে পাতে এসে গেল গ্রিলড চিকেন প্ল্যাটার এবং গ্রিলড ফিশ প্ল্যাটার সাথে বেকড বিন্স , করন্স , ব্রকলি । যা মন এবং মেজাজ কে চাঙ্গা করে দেবার জন্য যথেষ্ট । এবারে একটু সাস্থের দিকে নজর দিয়ে হাজির   প্রোটিন মিল্ক শেক । ধারা বহন করলো বুরিত ওয়ারপ , টরটিলা ওয়ারপ সাথে সেদ্ধ বিন্স আর গ্রিলড চিকেন । 

এর পরের চমক টি ছিল অল দে বাওয়েল , একটি খেলে সকালের প্রাতরাশের কাজ সারা হয়ে যায় বলা যেতে পারে । যাতে একসাথে বেকড বিন্স , গ্রিলড চিকেন , করন্স , স্প্যাগতি , মাশরুমের বর্তমান এবং সব মিলিয়ে এক অসাধারন পদ যা আপনার মনের সাথে পেট কে পুরপুরি ভরিয়ে দেবে । 

আমিষ এবং নিরামিষ দুই ধরণের পদের স্বাদ এবং মান বেশ উচ্চমানের সাথে পরিমানে বেশ ভালো । আর এর সাথে দামের দিকে নজর করলে কলকাতা শহরে জুরি মেলা ভার । 

 বিশেষ ধন্যবাদ -

I found this cafe in the newly opened collections..n made my mind to visit this cafe... The ambience is pretty eye catchy types.. Sp.  the ancient map of the world. I ordered the Multigrain ch salami with bbq sauce sandwich and the mushroom pesto penne pasta.. Pesto sauce wa their own homemade sauce and ws pretty amazing.. N d sandwiches were perfectly grilled and bth d dishes were lip smacking.. I also ordered banana berry shake and i was suffering from lil cold so they made it with warm milk so it was quite a treat to hv smoothie after a long tym.. I enjoyed the combination of banana and blueberry.. Lastly i ordered d waffle with maple syrup and fruits.. It wsnt impressive lik the other dishes.. It could hv been more crispy.... Bt my overall experience with their food and service ws satisfying.. I will love to visit it again.. And another notes is that they try to make their meal as health as they can :)  price wz neither too affordable or v pricey.. With taxes it costed m arnd rs640... 
P.s. : thumbs up 👍

Ordered a hot chocolate. Not very chocolaty either. The pasta was just average.

Management please look into the matter and improve.

COURTING COFFEES - This newly opened cafe at sector II amazed us with its ambience.
From the outside hoardings to flower pots with colourful daisies and little bit of gardening near the entrance , the two shelves on each side of the main glass door holding uniquely beautiful showpieces , few rows of yellow bulb chains making the dazzling ceiling and a coffee counter displaying bakery goods at the end with large orange halogens overhanging , a white wall board at the backdrop with the menu written , rectangular black wooden tables and chairs on both sides , a world map on one of the wall , picture frames on the other with windows painted in orange , this is what the first glance looks like.
To our surpise , we got to explore even more, a second room with floor mattress spread for being homely and comfortable , books stocked on shelves , a place dedicated to uninterrupted reading and gossiping,
a narrow corridor leading to a third room with a cubicle to accommodate 10-12 pax for private partying or small workshops and meetings .
Finally a last room with a kids corner , and few tables for the parents .
A complete setup done very tastefully in warm shades of yellow and orange , making it one of the few places which calmed my soul, giving good vibes the moment i stepped in , and the rest of the day was so full of positivity.

The staff does excellent job , with sincere efforts to make the guests comfortable and guiding through the menu with exact description and recommenations , mostly the menu comprising healthy options , with lesser oil and carbohydrates.

The food we had :
Hot chocolate , honestly a let down , a blunder mixing with milk.

SPAGHETTI IN CREAMY PESTO SAUCE - amazingly done and recommended

MULTIGRAIN BREAD SANDWICH WITH CHEESE BASE AND HAM STUFFING IN BARBEQUE SAUCE - excellent . Must try. Just that a mayo based dip would have suited more than the ketch up. It would have been great if there was an option for choosing the dip just like the given choices of bread , base, stuffing and sauce.
GRILLED CHICKEN - nice one , but chicken could have been more tender and at some portions left with skin , something i don't prefer , but the white sauce topping made it for me.

WAFFLE WITH FRESH FRUITS ANF CHOCOLATE SAUCE DRIZZLE WITH VANILLA ICECREAM - can be improved . The waffles were already soggy by the time it arrived , a Bit of more crunch and topping with fruit compote would have done well.

I would cut .5 for the hot chocolate and waffle , but the overall experience was just fantastic!

My best wishes with the team of Courting coffee.

It is a newly opened cafe located at Sector 2, Salt lake , near Tank no. 8. It has a homely feeling since it is within the premises of a residential building. It is located just beside the main road.

Ambience -  It is pretty cool and homely coupled with chic sitting arrangements. They have 4 spacious rooms. One is for regular dining  with chairs and tables. One is for chitchat while lying on carpet. This room has a good collection of books. The 3rd room has wifi in it and is a common working room. The 4th one is for infants , to play and have fun.
A 4 in 1 place in a cafe !!!!! It's realy interesting.

Service - Service is prompt with very polite staffs.

Pocket pinch is reasonable too.

Now let's review the food we have - 

The day was started with Cappuchino, which was very refreshing and enjoyable.

1) Balsamic Sandwich with Bar B Q mayonnaise , assorted veggies and spices.

2) Waffles with fresh fruits , choco syrup and icecream.

3)Spaghetti Agilo e olio.

4) Pancake with maple syrup, chocolate sauce and fruits.

5) Grilled fish platter with baked beans , corns, pepper , Broccoli mushroom with fresh cabbage.

6)Protein milk shake( peanut butter banana )

7) Burrito wrap.

8) All day bowl - combo of spaghetti, grilled chicken, baked beans, corns, pepper, Broccoli, mushroom with fresh cabbage.

We end our food journey with Pancake , which was totally enjoyable.

Quantity of both  Veg and Non Veg  dishes were nice & Well prepared  and all the dish tasted lip smacking and were all healthy.

It's a perfect place for hangouts with friends , family and also to work as it has free wifi,  by having tasty and healthy foods alongside.


Thanks Rajdeep Da for your invitation.

Thanks Sabitri Chakraborty Dutta & Anirban Dutta for your lovely  hospitality.

Cafe Courting Coffees
is a newly opened cafe in Saltlake Sector II, near Tank no. 8 - a place catching up fast with the cafe culture. The cafe is located in the compound of a residential house and hence gets an automatic homely feel and itself is a House and its in the ground floor. Parking though is an issue as the only place available is to park on the main Road.  You won't feel like leaving the place at all !!! Really Jolly Vibes and Happy people all around !! I was amazed to see such modern decor,ambiance and pretty landscaping. 
The artwork on the walls are a very tasteful selection. Very few restaurants are in sync with this generation's tastes on art, music and movies. Have a separate room to hang out with friends in cozy mattresses lying on the floor. A bookshelf was a proper add on advantage with a sip over coffee. A lot can happen over a coffee at Cafe Courting Coffees. It  got me excited and hooked on to the bookshelf for a while. 

Food was Mouth watering! I could not stop eating.  Started with Cappuccino. Perfect for an Sunday  chilled Morning. Then there were no stopping . 

Balsamic Sandwich with Bar B Q mayonnaise, assorted vegetables, pepper, onions and lettuce salad 

Waffle with Fresh fruits, chocolate sauce and ice cream

Spaghetti Aglio e Olio  

Pan Cake with Maple syrup, Chocolate Sauce and Fruits 

Grilled Chicken Platter with baked beans, corns, pepper, broccoli served with dip  

Grilled Fish Platter with baked beans, corns, pepper, broccoli served with dip 

Protein Milk Shakes (Peanut Butter Banana) 

Burrito Wrap (Tortilla wrap with boiled beans and grilled chicken) 

All Day Bowl - Combo of Spaghetti , Grilled Chicken, baked beans, corns, pepper, broccoli , mushroom with fresh cabbage. 

I have tried these whole list of items to assure you that it is incredible!  The quantity of meat they put in dishes is generous.  Their vegetarian spread is as good as their non vegetarian food. You absolutely cannot leave without ending your meal with their pan cake. It is impossible to resist it. Their menu offers a great variety, and each item does justice to your expectations.  

The menu has a little bit of everything - Continental, Italiano. But whatever is there on the menu is tastefully prepared and the ingredients are all fresh to provide healthy food  without disturbing your taste buds at all. 

The owners and the waiter are really helpful. The owners take personal effort in welcoming you, taking orders and are extremely polite. The work they have put into the concept of the place is brilliant.

Added perks is Free WiFi. Now, who wouldn't love that?

All in all, this is a very trendy and an amazing cafe! It caters to all kinds of crowd. Students, young men and women, middle aged women, a big group of family and friends, and those who get their laptop sit in their favorite spot and work for hours thanks to the WiFi.

If you are looking for a perfect place to hangout/work/catch up/ with brilliant healthy food in Saltlake then stop looking and head straight to Cafe Courting Coffees
.

Ambience is awesome accompanied with good food and books..what else needed for a weekend coffee break 😊. A seperate area for kids play and games keep the lil monkeys busy while we can sit on floor couches and can start talking with someone we are sitting opposite and with whom we never met before. Thank you for such new concepts to explore the unknown flavour of coffee.

This place is unnecessarily expensive! I mean who charge 60 bucks for an average tiny muffin? Was that Muffin from Hayat or Flurys? If you go by the name "courting coffee", you expect atleast a decent coffee and I am a person who can pay any amount for coffee ONLY if it has quality. What I had here was not Coffee BUT water. This place is a total disappointment to your taste buds and seriously pinches your pocket because no one would want to pay for water at an average looking place. 
And no matter how good your story books collection and show pieces are, I have come to Eat first and if that's not good then your cafe is a FAILURE.

Went for a brunch last Sunday with my sister and the experience was foodtastic. The plain cheese omelette and the cheese omelette with ham and bacon was food not only for the stomach but for the soul as well. The sautéed vegetable adds a tangy taste to the palate. The chicken cream soup served in a big bowl was a hearty sight for a soup lover like me. The coffee and the hot chocolate was perfect at the ending. The location is perfect coming from karunamoyee towards the CF block's ICICI Bank. A cosy corner with very friendly staffs.

Possibly the newest cafe in Saltlake. Being new in the hub of cafe is not an easy task. However, they are completely armed with all western possible delights to serve with and spread the flavour. We ordered breakfast, fried sausages, cheese omlette, grilled chicken, strawberry and chocolate shake. Honestly speaking.... I could'nt find a single fault in any of them. Rather all of them tasted extraordinary. They used the best sausages.... frankfurters. They made a herb based white gravy for grilled chicken which tasted authentic Italian.. served with all possible fresh sauted veggies like baby corn, zuccini, broccoli etc. Tossed the baked beans served in breakfast with chopped onion, tomato and chilies.... apart from these their evenly toasted crunchy bread, soft and delicate cheesy oozy omlette, milkshakes served in thick glass pickle jars are simple adding up the spice. Last but not the least their really fresh black forest cake which even many famous restaurant can't serve were giving it a winning look over the rest in town. Besides food they have 4 spacious rooms..one for regular sitting with chairs.. one for close group adda and cosy corners with sitting on the ground.. This room has awesome collection of books starting from Tintin, Bantool, I am Malala and many more. 3rd room is the co working room which offers wi fi.. and 4th one is for the toddlers to play n have fun. Have you ever been in any foodjoint like this before. If not then now is the time...... overwhelmed with a happy soul..... only thing which was lacking were the fresh fruits.. hence could'nt serve juices quite well. Which can be ignored million times. Overall they are simply unforgettable and outstanding.

It's not only dining but  an experience.  Menu is so varied and extensive.  Food was yummy.  We ordered breakfast platter which was really tasty and of very high quality.  The decor ambience is perfect for either adda or even for business meet.  They have a separate play area for kids too.. So while you read or play or chitchat,  your little one can have a gala time himself /herself.  Highly recommended.

A recently opened cafeteria at sector 2 salt lake, courting coffees has brought in the essence of adda over a coffee, which was really missing in that particular area..i went there with my girl last friday and we were warmly welcomed by the owner herself who was working really hard to get her setup running..the decor is really charming, courtesy the lighting that has been put in..they have a seating area comprising of the conventional tables and chairs and then a special area where you can just go in with your group, throw urself on the floor beddings and enjoy ur coffee and food , going through the decent collection of books they possess..whats great to see is the effort put into ensuring that people visiting there have a great time not just over the food but the quality of time spent there...as far as the food goes we had ordered a regular latte, a vanilla flavoured darjeeling tea with milk and a garlic bread with cheese...the garlic bread with cheese was so delicious that i almost thought of visiting it again the next day, just to have it, until different engagements got me..my girl had the tea and she really liked it (she is generally very picky and its hard for her to really like something)..the latte was served a bit cold though and something i would expect better the next time I visit..overall a thumbs up..keep up the good work..n make us visit courting coffees again n again..

While on my way back home, I happened to see this new cafe that had come up nearby. Now being a residential area, you won't find many restaurants or cafes in BK block, Salt Lake, so it was a pleasant surprise. This one is located just near to No.8 Island. They have converted a house into a cafe, and the result is pretty good I must say. Lots of space to chill out. 

I landed up there just the second day they had opened up so they didn't quite have all the items on their menu. I was happy to see waffles on their menu, but they did not have it. Ordered a hot cup of Mocha, which was good. Hope to try out the waffles next time I'm there.

Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 4/5
Coffee - 3/5
Location - 4/5 ( I am being biased here, since it's close to my place)

A definitely new place but great one near Tank 9 in Sector II of Salt Lake City. The Cold Coffee shakes with vanilla ice cream are awesome and deliciously grilled veg sandwich.My personal favorite are chicken sausages which the Chef Mithun may deliver in  sauce of your choice.

Hospitality of Debojit and Somnath are world class and they have a sheer experience of making it to the best league when they worked for Afraa .

Well when we plan to eat somewhere, we seek the following things:
Ambience
Food variety 
COST 
And this place had it all.  New but I'm sure it will draw customers very soon.  Place to sit formally and also informally in a separate place with books and magazines to read.  Friendly service.  Good taste.  Cost efficient. (almost, well its okay).  So all in all, its a place to visit more than once!
