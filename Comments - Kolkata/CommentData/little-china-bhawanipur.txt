This is not a dine-in place...you can either takeaway your meal or get it delivered at your doorstep..
Coming to the food :

1. Chicken Lollipop was very nice and crispy enough to make you fall in love with it. 5/5

2. Mixed Fried Rice : Perfectly cooked rice in red sauce and generous amounts of egg, chicken and prawn will satisfy you . 4/5

3. Chicken Noodles : If you are a noodle fan , you gonna love this for sure.. 5/5

4. Chilli garlic prawn : The garlic seemed to overpower the taste of the prawn . Slightly disappointed 3/5

5. Red pepper chicken : One word would be Fabulous 5/5

Coming to the value for money , it's extremely reasonable taking into account the quantity of the abovementioned dishes.
Pocket pinch : 400 for 2 max.

Food was not so good. More like a roadside stall. Quantity is good but not sure about the quality. Too much oily for my liking. Home delivery is okayish.

Ordered food from here... The delivery was 30mins late... Ordered dragon chicken, veg fried rice, devil's chicken and shanghai chicken... The quantity of the foods were good... The quality of the foods were also good... No delivery charge was taken... Bt, the prices written on the menu card were slightly less than the price of the items taken...

I tried there mixed noodles and chilli chicken few days back. The shop is very small ,more like a roadside food shop. No seating arrangements except 2 chairs on footpath .  I'm not so sure about the hygiene they maintain. Food quantity - sufficient for one. Quality- Average keeping at par with the prices.

I have ordered from this place several times since it is just beside my house. Their normal chocken fried rice is very nice but Mongolian fried rice isn't so good neither is Hong Kong Fried rice. I just love their lenon chicken, the taste is tangy and awesome! Once I ordered American Chopsuey from them, it was horrible. Their chowmein is average, chilly chicken is nice and spicy. Last night I ordered their honey chicken, didn't like it much, it had a weird combination of sweet and spice. Their momos are quite tasty. The quantity they give in every iten is very satisfactory even when the item is half plate. Overall a good place for getting a home delivery at very low cost.

I am a regular customer of this takeaway joint. They have never disappointed me with the quality of food. You will get awesome Chinese at pocket-friendly cost. They serve good quality Chinese delicacies and the staff are extremely courteous. Whenever am in Bhawanipur I make it a point to take food from this joint. This joint can indeed put a stiff competition with the renowned big Chinese restaurant. You must try their food to believe my words.

My most fav take away chinese joint, offers fine quality of chinese food. Only 2-3 chairs are available on the tiny footpath so its better to take the food home. Chilli garlic noodles are really good but when i tried chilli fish (mild) it was hilarious, I should have choosen 'hot chilli fish' instead of 'mild'.. Pan fried noodles are just plain noodles fried and made crispy and some gravy given along with it but the noodles were half burnt. Otherwise all the noodles items are good and worth trying. Manchoorians are great.. A few more items need to be tried.
