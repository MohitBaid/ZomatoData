Brace yourselves! This is a review of the restaurant but not the food. On a weekday at lunch time, they were serving just one item from each section of the menu. This meant that everything we ordered was unavailable. We finally chose to order from the Kerala dishes, only to be told they were out of malabar paratha. That's when we had no choice but to walk out. Absolutely unacceptable.

Dropped in to have some evening snacks here last week;ended up having an entire meal.  Yes,  it's that good. !! 
We started with a few kebabs.  But the best part was appams with kerala mutton  ishtu. The mutton was tender and the stew happened  to be perfect and most delicate.  I have personally  never been fond of South Indian cuisine,  but this recipe definitely  stands out.  The biryani that followed was equally good and unbelievably  light. 

I also appreciate their gesture of discounting and rounding off the final bill  by 10%.( Thank you team!!) 
 
However,  I really wish they work on their restroom and improve the facilities.  

I am definitely  going again.  This time to have their much recommended  dish- chicken chettinad.
Cant wait.  Cheers!! 🙋

The place is awesome. Good ambience, good staff. Starting with '' adrak ke panje'' & finishing with '' uniappam desert ''. My favorite tag - '' it doesn't matter how u start,  but finish it like Dhoni '' - my uniappam desert exactly comparison to my tag. And last but not the list Murg Samarpan- they suggested it and it was delicious.

I ordered hyderabadi murgh biriyani, it was promptly delivered, but when I started eating realised that it is mutton biriyani.   The mutton was hard and it was not tasting anywhere near hyderabadi. I never expected this from zomato

Went to this place about a month back and must say great food.. Lahori Aloo is a must try for starters.
For main course we had Appam  and potato stew which was simply awesome. .. overall a very good experience especially for those who have never tried the Kerala cuisine!

Visited this place twice recently. It impressed me on first visit but I was quite disappointed by the degradation of quality of food on the second visit. We ordered Adrak Ki Panje, the signature dish of this restaurant,  on both occasions. First time we found it heavenly and on second time it failed to meet expectation. On first visit, we ordered south India dishes which we liked. On second visit we ordered Ghosht Biriyani and Chicken Rezala (Wazid Ali ki Virassat). Biriyani was just ordinary. Rezalla had stale meats.

I wish management looks into the quality control.

Too Good... Which actually indicates their TAG line ... " Small Place, BIG Taste"... It's a HIDDEN GEM...

* Food -- Excellent
* Staff -- Excellent
* Decoration -- Good from outside, look like a Roll shop or take away counter, but at backside they are having 20 seating full AC fine dine.. we could not imagine that from outside, from road..Excellent
*Price -- According to their food quality & standard, it's VFM..

They are serving Nonrth indian & south indian along with kebabs... very selective items but very tasty... we ordered ADrek k panje & malai kebab@ Started.... then Tried their Yakhni mutton biryani & bestseller murgh samarpan (they suggested) and from south indian, Appam, malabari paratha along with Chicken Chettinad & Mutton stu.... each n every items is fantastic... and southindian dishes I m sure you will get very few restaurant @ kolkata but no other restaurant @ Saltlake..

Taken Orange blossom @ starting & unniappam @ Dessert which was fabulous and uncommon...

will definitely visit once again... Thanks for superb service... missed to take picture will do the same @ our next visit..

Neat simple ambience with good quality food served here..
We ordered the juicy julep..this mocktail was pretty average..i thought that it would b a very average place..the mocktail being a plain blend of orange squash and pineapple it seemed..
The murgh malai kebab was awesome..juicy soft chunks of chicken melts in ur mouth..the spice with the malai..gives u a celestial pleasure..
The appams were pretty good..soft and enjoyable.
The kozhi melagu curry..chicken dipped in their special gravy..i loved it.the gravy was rich and creamy..and the chicken was well cooked..
The masala kulcha was above average..
The unniappam..ah what a dessert...banana fried with rice and jaggery..served with rabri..awesome indeed..loved this dish..
The best part is the pocket pinch..pretty less..all inclusive of tax..loved it..

I really hate those restaurants who prepare dosa and declare themselves south Indian. So to have a taste of authentic south indian nonveg  three of us visited this place last night. We arrived around 9.30 so it was empty,A small at home restaurant .The service was prompt.The owner suggested some dishes,however we try to ignore as chef special are always costly.
Adrak ke panje was the starter and taste was awesome.It will soon be USP of the restaurant.
The biriyani was without potato and egg.It tasted well, however it is not pure hyderabadi as it is very less spicy.Chicken chettinad was of very new taste for me as i am not from south india but good.
Murg samarpan was   delicious.However they offered malabar patha which is of a high cost but taste wise very much similar to naan.

The best part is right now they do not charge any service tax.

Restaurant is new start up in  a small place with super taste.Probably the only restaurant that provides south indian nonveg.

I will love to visit again to taste kozhi melagu curry and chapala pulusu,of course Adrak ke panje.

Visited this place today evening.

First thing, the location is a little odd, GD Market, Sector 3.

Next the restaurant is on the smaller side, normal looking from outside.

Next lets come to the dinning part. The food quality is very good. I tried Veg items, Appam, Kozhi Melagu Curry and Juicy Julep, Shirley Temple. I must say all the above items were wonderful both in taste and quality, especially the Appam one and the presentation of Juicy Julep. 

Coming to Non Veg ones. We ordered Murgh Hariyali, Kundan Lal Gujrals Peshkhash, Malabari Paratha & Masala Kulcha. The chicken items were of great Taste and the sizes were also good. 

The staffs were also courteous enough.

Overall must visit place for a quite and quality time.

They most surely do live ip to their tag line of 'small place,big taste'.Had ordered from them over swiggy and boy!some food it was, absolutely delightful.We'd ordered for a portion of Hyderabadi biriyani,a plate of Appams and Chiken chettinad.Let me start with the appams first,they were soft and just that bit fluffy in the middle a perfect 5/5.The chicken Chettinad was full of flavours with five pieces of very well cooled chicken in it.A bit on the drier side with a lil bit of gravy and perfectly complimented the Appams.Now coming to the Hyderabadi biriyani,was delightful again but the chicken pieces could have been better and the half i'm deducting from their rating is because of that.That being said it comes with two pieces of chicken though and more than suffices for two hungry adults.They'd also packed a pouch of this most flavourful chutney made of gunpowder which was a nice touch.I'm yet to try their desserts which i surely will on my next order from them.Overall just the place Salt lake was missing and also means no more driving down all the way to Tamarind and Amini.

It was my first day in Kolkata, and I was really starved. Somehow I came upon this place and it left me mighty impressed. I had some prawn biryani, about which volumes can be spoken. The rice didn't have an overpowering taste of garam masala, nor was it oily. It contrasted very well with the slightly sweet and succulent jumbo prawns. The raita was slightly sweet, personally I had never come across a sweet raita, but I loved it nonetheless.
Coming to the dessert, I had the sheera based on the recommendation of the owner, who very patiently guided me through the menu. I had expected a very mundane halwa, but boy was I wrong. Each grain in that dessert spoke of perfection. It was not overly sweet, not dripping with ghee either. The flavor was reminiscent of the temple ladoos, like a hint of camphor. With the crispy nuts and caramelized raisins topped on it, it was a decadent dessert, which refused to leave my mouth for days afterwards.
The staff are courteous and attentive.

Appropriate TAG line they are having ; "Small Place but BIG TASTE" which  truly justified. They are serving south indian non veg which you could not get anywhere in salt lake in fact very few you will get in Kolkata but as per as taste is concerned they are perfectionist. Apart from that north Indian n tandoor is also available where I experienced excellent taste..

Must try their adrak k panje, biryani, appam, mutton stu,  chicken roast, murgh samarpan n Sheena n uniappam at dessert. 

Keep it up KNK team..

Now you really don't need to go all the way to South Kolkata to visit Tamarind or other South Indian restaurants. The food be it the Adraki Panje or the Appam with Mutton Istu or the Andhra biriyani - everything was sublime South and north mix. Clean, wholesome soul food. Met the Chef who is from Kerala was nice enough to come up and meet us and said next time we shouldn't leave without having the classic southern desserts - will recommend to all the foodies to have a go!!

"Small Place... BIG TASTE" - they surely do live up to it! 

We visited this place last night by accident and loved everything about it. We were walking by looking for a rickshaw to go to someplace else for dinner when we stumbled upon Kurry n Kebab. Just when we were wondering if it's worth a shot, we were warmly greeted and invited in by one of the owners. 

On entering we saw a neat and modern interior that justify the Small Place tag. We realised that this place specialises in Kerala cuisine and even has a chef brought in from Kerala for the same. We tried Appam and Kozhi Melagu Curry. Both were simply delicious and my husband really enjoyed the freshness and authentic feel of the Appam. We also tried a dessert, Sheera and loved it! They are serious about the BIG TASTE too. 

This place is only 2 months old and serves up high quality and authentic food. Definitely worth a visit!

Authentic Kerala food. Can call it home away from home. Appropriate spices ensure the aroma emanating from the dishes are as good as those made in Allepey or Kumarakom. Karimeen pollichathu is a specialty these guys have mastered. Chicken roast tasted splendid with appam. The complimentary ulli chammanthi just made the right addition. In addition we ordered a kebab. It was succulent juicy and with the right spice. Will love to come again.

We had appam in kochi after that we haven't got the same taste anywhere in kolkata. Thanks to this place who came as a saviour. Loved the softness and fluffy texture of appam. Biryani tasted spicy and delicious. I loved it. So is the melgau chicken where you can get the aroma of curry leaves and fennel. All total this restaurant is a must visit. Thanks.

Heard from a colleague that finally there is a restaurant on this part of town that serves south indian non veg .
So being brave soul foodies we landed there about a week after inauguration .

The menu is a mix of North & south indian dishes with Kabab's a mainstay 

Here goes the review :-
Decor : Above Average 
Ambience : Okay
Service : Scope of improvement , it is not that they are not polite but the the serving stuff is not well trained . Like when to give water or what the customer would like based on the feedback . explain the food etc 

Food : I liked the food ! The North indian fish kabab(Lasooni Mahi Tikka)  was "bhetki" and excellent .  We went there to try out south Indian non veg and did not come back disappointed . Appam was good and so was the chicken roast . The mutton roast(Nadan Erachi Ulathiyatu)( though excellent in taste was even hot for my taste (i eat green chillies with dal) . Malabar paratha was also nice.
We took a Kerala dessert(Uniappam) which was new and okay.

Suggestion : Please have fresh lime soda in your menu . Not all of us drink cold drinks and reduce the hot quotient of the mutton roast and i am coming back surely  and try to have all items in the menu available.

PS : All dishes are very reasonably priced.

I went to this place with my friend to try out 1 or 2 dishes in the evening. We took adreke panje as a starter. It was really mouth watering!! I am still slurping while I am writing this. Then we tried out their firni. The best firni I ever had in terms of both quality and quantity.
Rated 3.5 as I am yet to try out few more dishes here.

I would say its a hidden gem.
I was giving a second thought while entering
Because the place seemed to be like a roll centre but eventually it had a good big seating space as well.
Kitchen for veg & non veg are separate.
Items are very reasonable & tasty as well.
Located just out side the GD market.

If u wanna taste non veg Must have adrak ke panje in starter.. biryani n malabari paratha in side dish...dal n chicken samarpan..n firni n sheera in desert.... for veg lahori Aloo u must have..

Apart from indian try southindian delicacies which is not idly bada n dosa..it's purely kerala food.. though aappam will start from next month onward u must try chicken roast ..n unniappam in desert..

Few mocktail s also really good..

Very small place but yes as per the tag line it's a really big taste.. u must try ..

Differently delicious : The food was simply awesome. If you are tired of the same old same old you must try this place. You will be pleasantly surprised - and all this at a very reasonable price. The ambience is nice too, although the place is not too big.  We were treated royally but that was probably because it's new.

Excellent food, for starters we had Arak ke Panje and Lahori Aloo and it was simply outstanding.  The Hyderabad Chicken Biryani and it was very light and tasty as well for desserts we tried out Unniappams (guess I got the spelling right) with Rabiri and it was divine...  Delicious food in all...  Did not pinch my purse too much..  Value for money...  Must visit...  Just one thing the service staff was a bit puzzled but then I understand them being so since it is new place..  Overall the food was so good that the rest didn't matter

North Indian and South Indian dishes are mixed deliciously. Those who are the connoisseurs of good and healthy food this place should be the ultimate destination for them. Adrak ki Panje, Lahori Aloo in kebab (North Indian), Hyderabadi Biriyani, Malabari Paratha, Appams, Mutton Stu, Chicken Chettinad (south indian) are special mentions if anyone wish to come here. And last but not the least, the dessert section comprises of some mouthwatering dishes like Unniappam and Shola. I think this small budget friendly place in Salt Lake, Secror 3 is one of the best options for the real food hoppers. So this is kind of Bharat Bhraman through foods within our convenience. :);) <3
