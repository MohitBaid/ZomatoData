This is my breakfast place, and nearest to my college. Kachoris are quite famous here And lassi obviously. 
You can try singhads and all. 
They have a lot of joints around and they maintain uniformity in every specific joint. I don’t need to recommend this place as everybody should’ve been here. 
Pocket pinch is almost nothing.

Had ordered Samosa Chat, Khasta Chat, Gulab Jamun, Kachoris and Veg Cutlet. The size of the club kachoris are too small. Had expected them to be bigger. The sabzi was tasty though. One cool thing about this one was that you are supposed to get 10 kachoris in a plate; I got 11. Haha. Anyway, the Gulab jamun was hot and tasty as well. What I didn't like was the Veg Cutlet. Things became when I tried the two chats. Both were giving off a foul smell. Had to throw them into the dustbin.

The place is so small and is inside a street that is very hard to find. Tried many snacks there but still the charm or the feel was missing. Yes it is a good outlet for the ones who are living nearby. But if you want to specially come over here for snacks. Then it is not the place you should look for.

Just beside my office, this is one of the busiest tea and snacks store in the locality. Remains crowded most of the time.
Must try-  kesar chai, lassi , piyaz kachouri.

This place is located in Elgin Road near the Northern Park close to Forum Mall. Lookswise, this place is extremely commonplace and to be honest, a little shabby too. But the food they serve here is what sets them apart. Although, they have a very limited number of items but whatever they serve is very good. The location too plays its part. The residential area with many schools, colleges, malls and showrooms located in its neighbourhood ensures a big crowd. This shop is an ideal place for having an adequate breakfast or for having any other snack. I have had almost all of their items with the Hing Kachori, Gulab Jamun and Jalebi being a few of of my favourites. It is a must visit for every Kachori lover as they serve really tasty Kachoris with a spicy Aloo-Sabzi. The Gulab Jamuns were very delicious and so  were the Jalebis. Make sure you get the hot Jamuns or Jalebis because they taste heavenly. In case you are served cold items ask them to warm them up. You will enjoy having them even more. I have tried the lassi too but it was so-so. I have had better lassi elsewhere.A pocket-friendly place serving good food. Do visit this place if you are in this area. P.S.: Owing to the medium size of the shop, it becomes a bit cram-full during the rush hour especially in the morning and in the evening, which, might be undesirable. Otherwise, my experiences have all been pleasant.

Being a resident and having my college in bhawanipur, this small joint has been my saviour.
Sharma is known for it's pocket friendly yet tasty food and when you come here, this place do very much justice to our expectation.

My favourite is the kachori and the lassi. :)

Sharma Snacks centre, a popular eatery,  located at Bhawanipur, which offers tasty snacks & sweets at an affordable price. 

Service is quick with efficient staffs.

Tried their kachoris, lassi & gulab jamun. All were mindblowing and tasty. Gulab jamun was served hot. Lassi was thick, creamy & yummy .

A must visit place for kachori lovers.

কচুরি ভালো বাসলে এই খানে একবার অবশ্যই ঢুঁ মারতে হবে । প্রথম আলাপেই প্রেমে পরেছিলাম এই কচুরির । আকারে এবং স্বাদে দুটো তেই ভালো । সকাল এর টিফিন টা এরকম কচুরি আর পানতুয়া সহজগে সারতে পারলে বাকি দিন টা ভালো যেতে বাধ্য ।

Love kachoris? This is the place to be at! Rates are very low, but the quality and taste never go down. A very good place to be at, the service is also pretty good. Keep up the good work.
