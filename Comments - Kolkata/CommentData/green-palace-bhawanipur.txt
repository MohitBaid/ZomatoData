It was Sunday so the mood was set for booze .Located near Netaji Bhawan metro station this bar cum restaurant has both ac and non ac rooms.Booze was quite cheap. We took vodka,whiskey and beer to quench our thirst.A plate of chicken pakoda was ordered as well. The pakoda tasted average.Service is quick.

Cheap liquor, good food, and improved ambience; green palace has maintained it's position as one of the most popular booze joints in the city. We say at the AC section which was pretty relaxing, though the tables are a bit cramped for space. The waiters are decent and service is good. The food is pretty good which may come as a surprise even, given that cheap watering holes don't really offer great food. Drinks are decently priced. There is no designated ankling area, which can be improved. Overall, it's good for an evening of drinks with friends/ colleagues.

Located near Netaji Bhavan metro station opposite to Tripty. The booze is the cheapest of all the bar at Ashutosh Mukherjee Road. One of the oldest bar in Bhawanipur area. Starters are really good (fish finger & pepper fish must try). Service is little bit slow, because anytime you go there, you will see crowded all over. Reservation must. Great place to booze & hangout with friends after office. Yes, definitely will visit again.

This is a bar which I've been going to since college days. The alcohol is very very reasonable to say the least. Though u wont find a pub like atmosphere, still this is a place where people drop in returning from office , have a few drinks. Till date, all the food items I've had here is just outstanding. My all time fav food item is chicken lollipop, white chicken and pepper fish. Another thing to mention is that this is one of the few places I've been til date where u would get your food item at half plates which is very important for people who end up going there alone and don't have to order the full plate knowing well that they won't be able to finish it and pay for it.

A no nonsense kind of place..... The old non AC section on ground floor and the AC sections on the first floor. It is evident that the place has grown organically over time, the scattered sections and the stairs tell it all. I have been there decades back and revisited with a friend. The food is good and some of the side dishes are truly top class. Surprisingly, they don't serve fish finger which is such a pulsar side dish. Nothing to say about the drinks. Service is business like. No women allowed. I like the place and the approach.

There are places in Kolkata, the review of which is incomplete if the history is not mentioned. If you get back to early ninety's then after crossing Park Street while heading towards South Kolkata, there was hardly any bar cum restaurants to locate, only excepting "Green Palace", and its competitor " Tripty", both of which are located at the heart of  Bhawanipore, bang opposite to each other.
Tripty's ambience was somehow not liked by many, and that's why "Green Palace" (popularly known as GP) was a very popular and preferred watering hole of the region, which used to attract huge footfall, and since then it has been a place which is catering to its patrons with delicious food, and wide offering of drinks at SHOESTRING price. And today, GP has became one of the heritage destinations of Kolkata, which has won the heart of the stalwarts, they catered in  yesteryears, and at the same time became a buzzword to a huge chunk of the new generation. Even, it is heard that the GP that we see today is a renovated one as it was once damaged severely during the riot, after Indira Gandhi assassination.
Today, watering holes and drinking dens are cropped up at every nook and corner of the city, but surprisingly, GP is still shining with all of its pride and its head held high.
The interiors are designed like an old castle and the very dim lights inside creates a semi dark ambience which resembles a vintage touch of an old historic architecture. Even when the place is crowded, the ambience never is so loud as people walking in speaks in gentleman's tone, and the crowd is descent. The service staffs are very polite, well mannered, and very efficient in their duty. 
So far the food and drinks are concerned, this is a place where you can treat your taste buds with some mouth watering delights, and off course drink to your soul, and everything on a shoestring budget.
And, an exceptional dish of this place, which is a must try is "Chicken Prosenjit". Not only its finger licking delicious, but also it is prepared as a humble endeavor to honor the legendary superstar PROSENJIT CHATTERJEE(alias BUMBA DA). 
A must visit place for all the foodies and booze aficionados out there. Cheers.

This place is located right on the main road couple minutes away from Netaji Bhavan metro station. The atmosphere is a bit sketchy and I am not sure if one would be too comfortable to sit in there for an extended period of time. It's not a place to go chill and enjoy a beer or a drink. However the food is a different story. Kebabs, tadka, chicken dishes are absolutely mind blowing. Great taste and flavour in all of them. When it comes to kebabs the meat is juicy and tender. The flavouring in the rest are immaculate. Not sure about going and chilling In but it's a place to pick up food for sure.

Although most patrons of Green Palace are actually looking for a dirt cheap bar, there was a time in my childhood when outside food for me was synonymous with Green Palace. I used to love the aroma of the chilli chicken and fried rice when my dad brought them home. Many a Saturday night has gone by when it became a tradition for us to order from here! Let’s leave the nostalgia here! Coming to the food, its old school north Indian and the Chinese found here has an inherent vintage Calcutta touch to it! Few of my personal favorites that I can recall are Dry Chilli Chicken, Singapore Chicken, Pepper Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Kassa. There is plenty more to cater to the budget minded veggie and seafood lovers too. I urge you guys to come to this place for the food as well, because people generally look down on this joint with an uni-dimensional point of view. Happy Dining guys! Enjoy your food!

I have been here for almost 50 times in last two years. And i must say it surpasses all the bars i have visited till date. This JOINT is an cornucopia of drinks & non-veg side dishes. There is a non-ac section downstairs and two ac section upstairs. The drinks are cheap. The food is excellent. Specially mentionable are Chilly Chicken Dry, Manchurian Chicken, Singapore Chicken, Pepper Chicken, Tangri Kabab and Fish Bangkok. A great attraction is the complementary part along with Drinks!! (A plate of onions, shredded ginger dipped in vinegar and salt) And that's what makes the consumption of drinks even more interesting and food even more palatable. 
Its a must for everyone who enjoy a nice drink!!! The staff and management are extremely cooperative and customer centric. For Smoking you do not need to step out of the bar as there are places to smoke!!!!
CONS
1. The place is good for only male members.
2. Wash room on ground floor is ill maintained. However washrooms in ac sections are quite good.
So a great experience and worth every penny spent there.

This old man hasn't changed. The decor / the waiters / the TV on the corner showing sports channels and the price. South Kolkata's only value for money joint. On weekdays you have to wait & strand in queue as this is the favourite watering hole for all office goers returning home South. We had some friends who are settled abroad now coming over  & decided to take a trip down memory lane. So the nine of us packed into the metro and came down exploring on a rainy sunday. Not disappointed not at all disappointed. Had some light drinks & snacks. The snacks tasted so awesome that some of us decided for parcel packing also. We had boneless fish in black pepper and the old hit Chicken Lollypop. All in all a great experience.

In the early nineties after you crossed esplanade and park street going towards South Calcutta there were no restaurants with a bar license except Green Palace or GP as popularly known and the Tripty's bang opposite which did not have the ambience of a proper bar.It is unbelievable now,but this fact helped GP attract customers from all parts of South Kolkata,who could not afford the five star hotels or did not have the fancy club memberships.The loyal customer base was also helped by the affable owner Mr Ajeet and his band of loyal and fabulous waiters.
GP was a watering hole.It was not a restaurant which served drinks.It was a Bar which also served food.And very good food it was.And is.....
Chicken Butter Masala
Chicken Bharta
Mutton kasha
Tandoori Chicken
Chilli chicken
Chicken and prawn chowmein
These just about sums my culinary experience in GP.And after a couple of beers or whiskeys with close buddies in the air conditioned upper floor,loud,cosy and packed they did taste much better than what they would have otherwise.Also very reasonably priced and very personalised service made GP the legend it deserves to be.
Now with the proliferation of bars,pubs,drinking dens in every nook and corner of the city,they loyal customer base might have wavered but as in the changing norms of nature,I saw a brand new kind of young customers patronising this place......the legend lives on!!!!!

Located  near to Netaji bhavan metro station, this restaurant provides food & alcohol at the best (read cheapest) price on entire south kolkata region. The ambience of the restaurant is a bit above average. The food quality is quite good. The only reason I didn't put a 4.5/5 star to this is because the space of the restaurant is not as much as required for a restaurant where almost all the tables remain full during the peak hours of the day.

One of the famous vintage watering holes of  Bhowanipore-South Kolkata. The other vintage joint being Raul's at Hazra. Visited the joint after ages with my group of childhood friends. Was seated at the ground floor. The atmosphere/ambiance was dark and dingy.Amidst all the adda we had conveniently forgotten the fact that there is a first floor section which is air-conditioned and more comfortable. Had ordered a couple of bottles of Tuborg strong beer. It was served  with their complementary boiled sprouts, slices of ginger and rock salt, onion slices dipped in vinegar. We had ordered the salted peanuts separately. Price are dirt cheap as expected in these budget watering holes. Service was slow and inattentive. Cannot comment on the food as we did not order anything solid :)

I liked this place as a pub where people can go and talk over some drinks. I ordered some beers and baby chilli corn. Nice portion, sufficient for 2 and tasty. Just need to be careful with the green chillies or else need to end up drinking gallon of water.
Service was fast. 
They got 2 floor. Ac floor is perfect to sip at some beer.

This is one of the most famous watering holes located at the heart of bhawanipur. Though people go here just for drinks, the food is actually pretty good and very reasonably priced.
I love a few of their signature dishes like the Singapore chicken and chicken tikka kebabs. The tandoori is average here. Never tried their main course but I'm sure it will not disappoint. Drinks again is very well priced. They serve complimentary boiled sprouts with drinks. Pretty good place for a boys group looking for an affordable place to drink and dine

Another Women not allowed joint! I wonder why.

During the Pujas, try their two weeks only special Chicken Chilli Kebab. You will thank me!

The reasons why you should hangout here are: the ambience is superb, foods are mouth-watering and delicious and the most important thing is the affordable price of both foods and alcohols.
We had six different dishes with one alcohol and trust me we payed just Rs. 1200/- and that includes service tax and VAT. Must go for all and take the 1st floor (AC) (Y)

Frankly, I was bit nervous about the food quality. I always heard that it was my brother's favorite place to eat and drink. So when I finally went I was very delighted by all. The ambience, the food, the drinks, and Specially the Price. When you go to a Branded/Mall Bar cum Restaurant you will be charging you mercilessly with same quality but smaller amount of food. However, Green Palace is way more different that the others. They have awesome Kebabs, Tandoori items which will just melt in your mouth and they have 2 special dishes, One which I had, Chicken Reshmi Kebab and the other which was suggested by the customers eating there, was, Mixed Fried Rice. Talking about the drinks, it is cheaper and perfect with the special "Peanuts" they provide you, just wow! So when you really want to enjoy food and drink with comparatively lower cost, Go to Green Palace. The Heaven of Tandoor in Bhawanipur.

Olypub is usually the clear favourite when it comes to bars but this is my go to place. The service is much more efficient and they don't let you wait for too long. The food in Green Palace is also pretty amazing. I can vouch for the prawn pakora ( a little too salty), mutton fry and the chicken bharta. Large quantities and value for money. It's walking distance from Netaji Bhavan

Decently priced place. Perfect for that bit of "keora adda" (no, please don't create a ruckus, you'll be thrown out) with friends. Chicken and fish items are very well cooked and go down really well with alcohol. They have a special tomato and chana salad, sprinkled with fair amount of ginger and salt which tastes awesome. Ambiance in the ground floor is quite shabby, but the 1st floor is decent enough. I give it a 3 star.

A  peg of VAT-69  whiskey will cost you here  Rs 240/60ml peg  whereas a peg  of  peter scot whiskey will  cost you only Rs 110/ 60 ml peg .....this kind of disparity in  prices baffle me ....but food in  green palace is very good  ....  if you ever go there try out the  FISH delicacies  ..... because the Fish bazaar at jaggu bazaar is only  a  stone throw's away from this place....  in chicken try out CHICKEN FUING @ rs 120 /  plate overall  decent but SCOTCH prices are higher than  other places  ... another  tip don't sit on the ground  floor  of  green palace.....  sit on the top floor ....  because the ground floor is shabby...yes the restaurant has 2 floors
