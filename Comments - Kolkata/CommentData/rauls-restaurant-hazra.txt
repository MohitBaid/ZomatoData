This is located near jatin das park. Visited this during durga puja, ordered veg fried rice, chilli fish, chilli chicken, the quality of the food was literally poor and even the staffs there were so unfriendly i would not recommend anyone to visit there.

If you are thinking this place to be extraordinary you will be absolutely wrong.Located beside Jatin Das Park metro station this restaurant cum bar has poor lighlting.We had to switch on our mobile torch to read the food menu.Well the food came after 20-25 minutes which is also very slow.Tastewise its ordinary.I settled down for starter and booze,chicken drumstick,beer and rum. My friend took egg fried rice and chilli chicken.They give hand made bills but charge 18% GST.

The food is not so good and service is not so impressive. Yet you get cheap booze here,and the ambience is quite adjustable. If you are just gonna drink and do not want to spend almost double for your drink, this is the place ;)

Worst experience ever i had in my life.. The food was not good & quantity was not enough to compare to the price.. They did not serve u but they take service tax for that.. They took GST + Service tax.. their behaviour was very bad. I suggest u not to go there.

Located near jatin das metro station. This is a bar cum restaurant. Had veg friedrice, chilli fish and chilli chicken. They dont have a lot menus to offer. Ambience is poor. No AC was turned on and it was very suffocating inside. Waiters are inefficient. Dont except them to serve food if you ever go to this restaurant. Coming to the food it was okaish. Nothing stood off in this restaurant. The waiters make you wait for 15-20mins just for the bill to arrive. And they dont even give you a computer generated bill even though they take 18% gst. Hope i never ever visit this restaurant again

A third class restaurant. The quantity is very less compared to the price. You need to serve yourself. And they are charging extra service tax with the GST during this puja. When we said that you can't charge service tax with GST they were giving some shitty logics. At last we said that we are going to report against them to the consumer forum. After that they returned that 'service tax'.

Initially felt like a dark dungeon when I entered, reason being the absence of lighting in the place. No ambience as such...just a plain simple bar to drink and eat. Liquor is cheap but the food is of no use. Just go drink and move out.

They server moderately cheap alcohol, but the place is dimly lit, with no ambiance or rather unpleasant ambiance. The food was very average.

We ordered three 60 ml BP whiskeys. While drinking i found something was floating in my drink. I asked the waiter to change the drink as something was floating and drinking it will be unhygienic. The waiter comes with a spoon takes out the stuff and gives me back the drink. I requested him to change it then he took this matter to his owner and he called me to have a talk with this regard.

I went to the counter, First the owner was DRUNK, Secondly he accused me that i have put something in the drink. Then after several arguments he agrees to change the drink but to my surprise his behavior shocked me.. He poured the drink in the glass then pointed it in my face and say "ab dekhle kuch gira toh nahi h".. and started mumbling ( i was pretty much sure he was abusing . We cancelled the food order and paid for the 3 whiskeys (we dint drink it) and left.

This was the worst experience i had in a restro bar in kolkata. Before going to this place i would advice ¬†you folks to think again.

I would more or less agree to what my other foodie friends have mentioned about this place. But having said that I would like to highlight a few things about this place-
1. Location: 5/5 boy u dont need to walk more than 2 steps from JD park metro üë£üë£üëçüëç
2. Interior: 2/5 - really not maintaned well, looks like they have tried to increase the number of chair and table at such an affluent level that people have to knock the guy behind so that he can go out to pee
3. Food: 1.5/5 - No varieties, 95% of what is mentioned in menu is not available. All they would insist you to order for is "Dry chilli chicken" and " Chicken pakoda"
4. Beers are not served chilled, true
5. Overall, in such a cheap place, we should be happy with whatever we are getting. Completely My personal opinion but c'mon every restaurant cannot be bbq nation and every bar cannot be Irish house or opium right?

Had went here a long time back and had a bad experience then.!! Dared to go back to this place once again with my friends.! The drinks are comparatively cheap, beers of your choice are harldy available...and I don't know why every time they claim their beer is hot.!! And not cold.!! Food is pathetic and the waiters act as if they are doing you a favour..won't recommend visiting and won't go there..a complete waste of time and money let alone your mood gets spoilt.!!

This is a cheap and shabby restaurant cum bar tucked away behind the jatin das park metro outlet.The only reason why people visit this place is because of the cheap booze.But then the stock of drinks is extremely limited.The food is pretty mediocre at best.The ambiance is downright bad.They have a non ac section in the ground floor and an ac one upstairs which does not even work at times.There is no smoking zone.Hygiene and cleanliness is a big issue.The waiters are moody.Overall this is a place you can try only if you are in desperate need of drinks and even more desperately short on budget!

Hidden away behind the metro station of J D park this little restro cum bar is surely hard to find out. My review is solely bases on the experience if having booze there. 
There is no ambiance. Neither do they have a large number of options in drinks to choose from. Service is slow. However they serve  peanuts with the drinks. That was the only nice thing about this place. N I surely will not go back there. Go there if u r completely broken.

Been there around three or four times. I am entirely writing this based on my experience with booze there. 
PROS:-
1. Value for money booze. A peg of signature is only 110, Blenders Pride is only 120. So quite cheap than the surrounding bars. 
2. The all guys area is literally cool. The lights are a special attraction. You are in for a good ambiance. 
3. The service is good and friendly. 
CONS :-
1. They serve the booze in plain glasses which disappoints greatly. You never enjoy beer in anything but a beer mug, nor whiskey in anything except a whiskey glass. Minus 1 for this. 
2. No proper smoking room. 
3. Not a lot of choices in the beer section. 

All in all it is a great place to hangout if the cons doesn't matter to you. I myself liked the place well enough to visit more in future. 
P.S. Do try the chicken pakodas. They are crisp, succulent and awesome to taste. CHEERS!

Spoon teeth fork nothing is enough to slice their boneless chilly chicken.. In comparison Indian mughlai dishes are much btr.. Biryani chaap etc. But simply if u r interested in drinking at cheap price than a must visit. Ambience I would say more than avg...

This shady place near hazra is good for a cheap drink or two, but look away if you are looking for anything apart from that.
Firstly, they don't have half the things in their menu and also quality of food is comparable to a street shop.
The chicken pakodas we ordered with our drinks were still okay but the fish items had a rotten smell. 
The place isn't well lit, the smoking rooms are stuffy, the food isn't that great and the service is below par.
All in all- a 2 out of 5

It is located just beside the metro outlet of Jatin Das Park. There are two sections here, one for the people accompanied by a lady friend company and the other for a total sausage fest. The ambiance is nothing special to talk about nor is the service. The waiter keeps bugging you about your order and tries to manipulate it when you are starting to get a buzz. Moreover the place seems to only serve Kingfisher when it comes to beers. I have been to that joint a number of times but never been served anything other than that. Only recommended to those who are looking for cheap beer of a brand called kingfisher.
P.S avoid the Chinese food here

it's a drinkers' paradise as alcohol is quite cheap here. mainly people come here for boozing only. the interior is basic with tables spread within a very small space making the whole setup cramped. people don't care about that much though, since the price is very low and food quality is ok. staff here are slow in taking orders and also, food takes long time to come to your table after order. the light is very dim and low making the place look very shady but it's not like that :) based on my experience, the tandoori food is better than the chinese here. tandoori chicken and chicken pakora were both ok, nothing special. it's a good place for hanging around with friends over few drinks, not so good for a family meal though.

An absolute no-go. The booze is cheap that's true. But if its the sole criteria you are considering than there are places where booze is even cheaper. The place is dirty,shady and a stale piss smell always lingers which generates nausea to non-drunk persons. None of the foods were worth a remember, the cost is low but so is the portion,the smallest drumsticks that I ever have witnessed belongs from here. The waiters are nagging. The stock is unpredictable especially when beer is concerned. Frequently you'll discover that they don't have any strong beers at all.A huge thumbs down from me.

If you are near the Jatin Das Park Metro Station region and you seriously want to get drunk without paying a fortune, and you do not mind a shady place, this is where you should go. If you are there with a friend or two, you have to get up a flight of stairs to a dimly lit room where you can sit according to the whims of the waiter. 

Booze is reasonably cheap - the last time I came here was actually to have a very intense discussion with a friend. Within minutes, rum and whiskey was ordered, with coke. They had given us dirty glasses so I asked them to change it. The glasses which came in replacement was a smidgen less dirty than the previous ones. 

They serve peanuts, onions and slivers of raw ginger and pink salt (beet noon) with their drink. The peanuts that we got were pretty stale. Ick. They also took A LOT of time to get us the drinks we wanted, and even more time to get ice. At this point, we had started our discussion, and well, we were not paying too much attention to anything else.  

The waiter came in to ask us if we wanted any food, and seriously speaking, we weren't in the mood to eat, so we told him no. After five minutes, he came back to ask the same question. It is quite irritating to see this happen. Anyway, our discussion over after a while, we were happy to see a bill which was just over 700/- which was pretty reasonable in our books.

I have visited Rauls quite a number of times during  my college life. It was never my favourite but it was okay for a quick drinking session with friends as it is near my place. 
Recently I visited Rauls after a gap of 3 years on 31st Dec 2013. I and my friend were waiting for a couple of other friends at around 4PM when we suddenly decided to go in for a quick beer. 

Location and ambiance: Located very near to the Hazra junction, it is situated just beside Khosla Electronics hidden behind one of the metro outlets. The ground floor is non ac and the 1st floor is air conditioned. We first went into the non ac section and realized that the whole place stinks of a dirty lavatory and it was impossible to sit and have anything out there. We immediately moved to the 1st floor which was supposed to be air conditioned but it was stuffy as the air conditioner was not operating. There are 10-12 basic tables with very basic sofas which can accommodate around 35-40 people. The lighting was dim and it kinda looked shabby to me. 

Food and drinks : We went there just for a quick beer so we did not order any food. We were told that only Kingfisher was available. So we went ahead and ordered 2 KF strong beers. The beers came in quick and was served with complimentary peanuts and onion. The peanuts were of the worst quality I had till date. Beer was priced @Rs130 each

Service : Service was okay and nothing much to mention. Waiters were polite. 

Conclusion : Though it is one of the most famous watering holes near the Hazra area, I certainly did not have a pleasant experience. I have been to Rauls before but this time I particularly did not like how the ground floor was stinking. On my previous visits most of the beer brands were available. The chicken fry used to be my favourite at one point in time, dont know how the food tastes now. The pricing is still decent, but I would prefer Oly pub as the crowd is better and even for the other liquor options. Dont intend to visit again.

This is strictly a watering hole. Nothing more. Nothing less.

I happened to visit the place with a group of friends when we were extremely short of cash. While we did not have any expectations whatsoever, Raul's still managed to disappoint us. While the prices were definitely agreeable for a group on a tight budget everything else was unsatisfactory. The glasses were unclean and we had to prompt the waiter to change glasses, wait staff was not just amateur, they were downright careless and the ambiance seedy. The food served tasted just average. 
Summary: Avoid unless you just want to have a drink and dont care where.

rauls : The students at Asutosh College know Rauls as Asutosh College on the rocks :) The place always seems to be filled with college students from the vicinity who prefer to down a few shots at minimum assault on the pocket. Rauls offers just that along with a cozy setting. Ambience and atmosphere is not much. The place is more Bar and less Restaurant. The drinks cost much lesser across brands. They also have a large digital clock which show the time when the last drink will be served. Handy if you're a heavy drinker and lose track of time. Plus, they have been known to waive the VAT on more than 1 occasion. It feels like a college hangout with o judgemental old folk and minimum family crowd. On the other hand, the crowd is not too rough and bar brawls have never been heard.

Chakraborty Tip : Just as it takes perseverence to find all good things in life, so it is with Rauls. The place is completely hidden behind the Uttam Mancha outlet of the Jatin Das Park metro station.

Let's be honest - Rauls is less of a restaurant and more of a Bar - on the likes of Green Palace , Embassy etc - just lesser known, I have been to Rauls umpteen times during my college years or even after that . When you like to drink in a restaurant cheap and not at home - just for getting served - you can visit Rauls . Located just opposite of Basusree Cinema Hall , adjacent to the Petrol Pump , Raul has sitting space for families (eek) in ground floor and others on 1st floor . 

I have had food in this place very less times even though i have been there with my friends , my relatives and even alone . You may have Chicken Tandoori , or C.Chicken or similar but dont think too much about it . 
Service is pretty fast like Green Palace because they earn by helping you drink more :) They also have some good AC's because otherwise all discussions are pretty heated . You will probably have to speak in a high tone just to hear yourrself speak . 
Another fun thing i noticed there that they had a large Digital Clock which used to show the last drink time . 
If you are with friends or office colleagues , this might be a good place to catch a few beers or whisky at low rate .

Well this place can be termed as the Olypub of South Kolkata as far as prices are concerned.The cost of a Smirnoff-60 ml is at par with Olypub.Snacks/starters are ok and barely edible with the drinks.Chilly chicken dry,pakodas-veg and non veg types should be fine.Do not expect any exotic food item,personalised service etc.This is strictly a budget joint for tipplers.3 stars only for the dirt cheap prices for booze.

This was one of the places where I went to drink when we had a tight budget. The place is not visible from the main road even though the location is in Hazra more due to the Metro station. This place serves liquor at a pretty cheap rate. The food is nothing worthy of mentioning. You can pretty well order some dry chilly chicken along with your drinks, that is generally fine. This is definitely not a place for fine dining. The place is very dim lit and people generally go there only to drink so the crowd is definitely not the sophisticated one. If you want to drink your heart out in a bar this is the place for you. Liquor is cheap, no sophistication. STAGS ONLY...not a place for family at all.

Raul's Bar and Restaurant is a small wine and dine place located just opposite Jatin Das Park Metro station. Raul's is one of the oldest bars in the city and just like the charismatic Coffee House in College Street, holds a special place for the old and the young.


During its initial years, Raul's was just like any other economy bar. However, with time, it has expanded amazingly and it now has an a/c and a non a/c floor and also a separate floor which has a family diner as well.


My association with Raul's dates back to by college days when like any other college going teenager, I was living on my monthly allowance plus a few extra bucks which I earned by giving tuitions. The first time I visited Raul's was during a small party arranged by one of my friends to celebrate his birthday. 

Since then, I have been a regular at Raul's. The best part about the place was that during my college days, they served beer and alcohol at the cheapest rates. Imagine, having a bottle of chilled beer for just Rs. 80 and a peg of 90 ml rum for just Rs. 25 was like hitting a jackpot during those days. However, the biggest attraction was the chicken dishes at Raul's. I can definitely bet on the fact that no other bar or restaurant serves such delicious chili chicken as Raul's.


Well times have changed and so has Raul's. You no longer get hard drinks for 25 rupees nor beer for 80. However, the old charm of the place is still intact. Initially we criticized the fact that the management did not take proper care of the place. The walls were not painted, the sofas were the same as during my college days, etc. but very soon we realized the fact that it was pretty difficult to maintain the old charm and make the customers nostalgic every time they visit the bar. I definitely go nostalgic every time I visit the place. No matter the problem that we are dealing with in life, when my friends and I meet at Raul's, we end up talking about our college days, our flings, our dare-devil attitudes - our "golden" days as a whole. 


Every time I visit Raul's, my order is same as usual. I start with a bottle of chilled beer and dried chili chicken. Then I move onto vodka with lime cordial and roasted chicken. Believe me, you won't get the taste anywhere else in Kolkata. The staff is also very courteous and friendly. 


To sum up, according to me, Raul's is like the Coffee House for people who love to go nostalgic over a glass of liquor. To me, it is the best place to relive my college life with by buddies. Cheers to Raul's!

raul's pub is hidden very neatly behind the jatindas park metro station  outlet near  uttam mancha  , so much so that you will have difficulty locating the pub ,  the pub has two floors of which the ground floor is downright filthy & at times unbearable , the  first floor which is air conditioned fares slightly better ,  a place for STAGS ONLY  and that too for alcohol consumption only , no ambience at all  , infact the place is so dimly lit hat you will have trouble reading  the menu ,  waiters are very shabbily dressed  & worst of  all  the serve whiskey in  vodka glasses  , overall a  no no from my side but if your  budget is very less then you can go to this place ...  scotch whiskey here wil  cost you Rs 200  / 60 ml peg that too non premium  brands ...  food is nothing special also ....  go only if you have a POOR BUDGET
