The taste buds is not the intended recipient to please you, rather the foods need to show its jalwa..after that taste buds will do there work.this restaurant is good as well as very comfortable..but they don't have the experience to handle huge amount of customers.. Sometimes they make mistakes.. Otherwise in normal routine maintenance they serve good food..foodie is happy but advice need to improve more..kp it up..üòäüëç

Kimli had been in our list for quite a long time. While roaming around Gariahat area and considering different places to have dinner at, we decided to drop by Kimli.

To be honest, the first impression wasn't good at all. We didn't find the ambience nice but somehow we were hopeful about the food, and it came out to be true. For starter we ordered Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish. The fish was amazingly cooked. It was so soft that the pieces were melting in the mouth. The dish was prepared with lots of chilli and garlic.

For main course we ordered Special Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Lamb. Both the dishes were just delicious. We couldn't stop praising the food. The lamb tasted amazing.

Although the food was extremely tasty, the staffs need to improve their services. The quantity of food in each item was enough for two people. The prices printed on the menu card are inclusive of taxes.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 650 for two

We went for lunch. Ordered chicken egg fried rice (‚Çπ162) and green pepper lamb (‚Çπ250). All prices are including gst. It's a very small joint and pocket friendly. With dim lighting and abstract paintings on the wall I'll rate it 3.5 for ambiance. For food fried rice was little blunt though it had big chunks of chickens in it and quantity was enough for two. Lamb was very soft and tasty. I'll love to try it again.  Overall it was good experience.

Went there for a friend's birthday treat. Situated in golpark. The ambiance is cozy. A good place for Chinese cuisine. Worth value of money.  We ordered there Teriyaki chicken, chicken Hakka noodles, prawn egg fried rice and golden chicken. Each item was equally good and freshly cooked. The quantity was also very good. A reasonable place for Chinese lovers.

Awesome garlic duck, fried spring chicken and 1large x 4 chicken hot and sour soup. Quantity more than sufficient for 4 Adults. Quality 9/10. 
Then greed indulges in a plate of Cantonese noodles- average 3/5.

Poor customer service. Waiting guests are not greeted with no record of who is after whom as they don't have a waiting list. Manager was rude and had no idea of what customer service means. Food was average. Not worth. Decor was okay. I would prefer a chowman or a hatari with same price,better food and BETTER customer service!!

Being out for dinner, we knew this place wouldn't have much of a crowd. The queue started after a few moments of our entry. We got our table after 2 groups. 
Ambience(9/10): A beautiful place, clean and well maintained. 
Service(7/10): A bit tough to reach the waiters for any requirements. The person at the counter had a bad temper, scolded the swiggy delivery person and disturbed us in the way.

Orders
Crispy Chilli Prawn for starters
Mixed Fried Rice
Hot Garlic Fish 

Crispy Chilli Prawn(10/10): Crispy and fresh and had no smell at all! Brilliant cooking even on such an occasion. Every piece was delicious. Brilliant choice for a starter! 

Mixed Fried Rice(8/10): Had a significant amount of onion in it, which I was not fond of. Except that, everything about this item was good! Good amount of add-ons, awesome quantity for 2 and every grain had a sprout of flavors on the taste buds. 

Hot Garlic Fish(9/10): These super tender pieces can serve 2-3. They're fresh and tastes exemplary! No doubt they have quiet a good rating on Zomato!

Albeit it is little bit costly but quantity is sufficient. Chilly babycorn was the best starter I had over there. Apart from that, other dishes were also very well. Staff was very much interactive and courteous as well. They gave a very good service to us. Ambiance was very good and the place was little bit wintry. Otherwise everything was perfect.

It's one of the budget friendly chinese restaurant near golpark,hindustan park area. Ordered mixed fried rice,chicken halka chowmein,chilli garlic chicken & lemon chicken. The food was okay but could have been better. The service was satisfactory but the ambience wasn't that great!! But definitely a good place to eat if you have a low budget.

Good location, easy to spot. We were 2 people and had 3 items. Let's talk about the quantity: it was amazing, hands down. We had 'Red Chilli Garlic Chicken'(not lollipop) for starters, I have to say it is perfect. Great size, 11 PCs. a plate, not highly spicy but yes, flavourful. Schezwan Mixed noodles and button mushroom chicken constituted the main course. The warned us that Schezwan noodles would be spicy, but it was not. If you have had good Schezwan noodles elsewhere before, you are likely to be dissatisfied. It didn't quite hold the taste. The button mushroom chicken was soothing yes, but we had to add salt, pepper and what-not, to finally understand that it even has a flavor. We incurred a bill of 600 bucks which might sound expensive but it's not considering immense quantity of everything. The service was very good amd ambience is okayish, it gives out a family-feel. I won't say it is an amazing Chinese place but definitely above average.

When you crave for Chinese cuisine this is the place.
Situated right opposite to PC Chandra Jewellers in Golpark its very easy to locate.
We ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles and Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken (Dry)

The Noodles was good with an ample amount of chicken but the prawns were a bit chewy.

The Chicken dish came with 11 small pieces which was spicy and tangy as we wanted.

Coming to the quantity and quality-
Quantity was more than sufficient for two and quality was quite good if we compare it with the price. The prices are quite reasonable.

Our bill came upto to Rs 375.
And the prices in the menu are inclusive of tax.
The staff was hospitable.
Definitely worth a second visit.
The only request is the menu should be updated in Zomato.

This place was chosen at random. The place has good ambience with sufficient amount of lightings. We ordered schezwan rice, kancas lamp and fish.
The serving was done in small handis looked niced.
The rice was good no doubt. Kancas lamp was great, the meat was shreded and perfectly cooked in a little spicy gravy the combination was great and the fish was also great we didn't expected it to be that much good but turns out to be great.
The quantity of each dish is sufficient to suffice to people easily.
Finally its quite pockey friendly the best part is the taxes are included in the price of the dishes.
Do visit this place once for sure. üòä

Kimli is exactly behind aanchal sarees (walk towards golpark from gariahat more). It is quite a pocket friendly place and apparently looks like a residential housing turned into a restuarent. Visited here a quite number of times and was never ever dissapointed. Sufficient quantity for an affordable platter. I have tried manchurian chicken, schezwan chicken and chicken egg friedrice. Tasted delicious each time.  But be ready to wait around half an hour. Decor moderate. Food affordable and pocket friendly with sufficient quantity. Must visit for chinese foodie.

Food is good. Ambience is rather ordinary. It will feel more like a large residential apartment turned into a restaurant. The service is quick only if it is not crowded. Anything Chinese is good. Quantity is more than many places. Expect a 30minute waiting if you go there at peak hours on weekends. I recommend:

For starters, we had red pepper chicken. The chicken pieces were spicy and chatpata. We had schezwan fried rice and hot garlic chicken for the main course and they were delightful to the palate.

The biggest plus? 0 taxes! You pay exactly what you order.

              We tried out Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles, Chicken Egg noodles and Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Lollypop. The food was good though I expected even better.

FINAL VERDICT- This place is quite good, but I must say that I've definitely had better at this price point.

The ambience always works as an appetizer for me and kimli almost rocks it. Almost. With a wide variety of Chinese dishes kimli lures in the experimental me to explore cuisines. The quantity is more than enough for me as per the main course items. Though expect things to be a tad spicy. And do care to mention the amount of sauces in dishes when ordering if your taste buds are sensitive.

Kimli is located very near to the Aanchal Sarees or 2 mins walk from the Muralidhar Girls' College to be precise. This place serves good Chinese at a very pocket friendly price that too with a very good quantity. They did increase their rates after the introduction of GST but that won't create a hole in the pockets.
Have been in this place for a couple of times. On my recent visit to this place I had opted for a Chicken Prawn Cantonese Chow mein along with a Red Pepper Chili Garlic Chicken as a side dish. No complaints regarding the quantity. However, I did find the chow mein a bit smelly later on realised it might had been something to do with the oil they had used.
Talking about the ambience, it is surely a nice place to go with family and friends.
The staffs are very generous and helpful. They have been in this restaurant since a long time.
Would really appreciate if they could do something with the quality as well!

Once a small restaurant that served economical Chinese food, Kimli has expanded since then due to its popularity among foodies and it gets difficult to get a table here on weekends.
I'm a fan of their starters and side dishes,which are full of flavour. 
Among the many times I've visited this place,I was disappointed one time when they'd made the Manchurian Chicken too salty,rendering the gravy unpalatable.
Despite that one hiccup,they've maintained their quality and quantity at good prices.
A must try for all the Chinese foodies out there.

This place is for Great Chinese.Went there couple of days ago. It is situated just in a lane of Hindustan Park.The decor is moderate.Now about the food:-We ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Hunan Chicken.The rice was cooked well.The quantity is enough for two people.It had big pieces of chicken and prawn.Hunan is particularly spicy but when I ordered requested to make it less spicy and they did it deliberately.The only thing I found that the gravy was slightly on the oily side.The chicken was juicy,soft and it was perfect.Overall,the food was well and the pocket pinch was also within 400.Worth to be there.Had a nice time and want to come back again.

A pocket friendly place that offers tasty chinese dishes. The decor of this place draws one'a attention. One should definitely try seafood here. Along with great quality, they offer huge quantities of food. Apart from this, the service is really quick.

The seafoods are the best part of KIMLI. My personal favourite here is the Crab Teriyaki and Lamb In Oyster sauce. I highly recommend the lamb preparations here.. :)

Once a small restaurant that served economical Chinese food, Kimli has expanded since then due to its popularity among foodies and it gets difficult to get a table here on weekends.
I'm a fan of their starters and side dishes,which are full of flavour. 
Among the many times I've visited this place,I was disappointed one time when they'd made the Manchurian Chicken too salty,rendering the gravy unpalatable.
Despite that one hiccup,they've maintained their quality and quantity at good prices.
A must try for all the Chinese foodies out there.

I went kimli with my friends! This is my first visit to this restaurant!
Direction : i went by gariahat more.. 4point crossing road! If u walk towards reliance shop...then kimli is 7-8mins walk from gariahat more!
Ambience : it looks tiny from outside but it is like a tiny bomb from inside...! Well,let me b clearcut about it...! It is a well decorated air conditioned restaurant which is adorned with dim lights!
Food and service: well, we ordered chicken thai soup (small bowl) , fish manchurian,mixed fried rice and chilli garlic chicken with gravy!
They served us within 10mins!
The quality was really good!! I must say!
The fish manchurian is recommendable for giving a taste! I liked it! It is dry manchurian but taste was really nice!
The small bowl of soup was enough for one to give a full satisfaction to his tummy......only if he choose the soup as his main course!! If you want to have it as starter then u can share it wd other !
The quality of mixed rice was nice...it was filled with prawns,shrimps and sliced boiled chicken pieces which will sum up as a heavy and yummy dish!
Quantity is enough for two..i mean if any third person is there,they will get bit satisfactory quantity of rice from one bowl!
The chilli garlic chicken dish was spicy and filled with chilli pieces!! 8 pieces were there and it was yummy in taste!!
The staffs over there were really prudent!
Bill: It is 610 all total...i will visit again! I am really impressed with the food and service!

Food was good but service was poor. Waiters and the cashier need to be in school again, I hope this time they might learn some manners. If anybody wants to enjoy good food there are many place, but if it has to be cheap and if someone can keep his/ her dignity back home then someone can visit this place. I had to give a rating or else I won't be able to write the review. It has to be (-)

You will have a comfortable homely atmosphere. Not too stylish.
The management here is good.
The place is little decorated.

About the food, it is good here. The cook know what he is cooking.
Soup items, specially Chimney soup is delicious and too much in quantity.
Duck platters are authentic.
Chinese Items are made with care.
Pron dishes need some improvements .
Cost wise the place is Excellent . 
If you ask, they will let you charge your phone. :-)

Landed in this Hindustan Park restaurant one afternoon for lunch with few friends and a gigantic apetite.
We went on to order the mixed prawn cantonese noodle,schezwan chicken and wings on fire.
The wings on fire was mindblowing with how it played on with our taste buds. 

This little chinese restaurant met and overdid our expectation and if one is looking for a great chinese place at pocket friendly prices then Kimli is the place to go to. Also,they do not charge any kind of tax which is great I feel specially for students.
This place definitely deserves multiple visits.

I loved their Cantonese noodles and the golden chicken was simply awesome, the quantity of all the three was more than enough for us 3 people! I found the hakka noodles slightly salty thus deducting .5! Ambience is also great! would love to visit again!

Never try chilly garlic chicken here,and don't know what else. Utterly disappointed. My meal was spoiled.

Located near Murlidhar girls college. Just opposite to P.C. Chandra Jewelers. The place is decorated well and is famous for it's Chinese.Been there last week while returning from Gariahat..! If I have to speak about its location...I must say that it's very annoying to find out the joint .....I had ordered # Chicken LOllyPOP  #mixed Fried Rice #Lemon Chicken and the Teriyaki Duck and the portion was too much for a single person. The other three people along with me were unwilling to have it, and were very much content with their Mixed Fried Rice and lemon Chicken. It was quite filling. 
The ambience is good. The service is impressive. The food is amazing and the quantity is commendable. It never fails to impress me every time. I love to keep going back their and repeat the dishes as many times I want.

We ordered Schezwan rice, chili fish and American chopsuey. They literally took 5 mins to serve the food. This was so tasty and so much in quantity. Four of us were almost struggling to finish. The waiters were attentive too. It's so pocket friendly also. I would love to visit here again. Overall a great experience.

Well mentain. Nothing special about decor but ambience was good.
We ordered
Egg chicken fried rice :- rice was perfectly cooked with good amount of egg and chicken pieces. Quality of fried rice more than enough for two people.
Then for side dish we ordered
schezwan chicken :- just delicious. Perfectly blend of correct amount of spices. Nice Flavour. Chicken pieces was fresh and tender. Well cooked. Just lip smacking good üòã
Overall it was a good experience. Both food quality and quantity was very good. Staffs are friendly and helpful. They pour the glass of water as soon as it gets empty. Extremely pocket friendly restaurant. They don't charged gst or any other charges. Definitely Recommend for this place.üëç

Well we landed here with a lot of expectations and this place didnt let us down.
Stands admist hindustan park almost close to gariahat.
This places offers good chinese dishes.
We ordered Chicken prawn gravy noodles, Schezuan chicken and wings in soya sause.
To the wonder all these dishes very good.
Schezuan did do the wonders , satisfied our taste buds to a great extent.
I didnt expect this place to be so go, definetly deserves a better recognition.
I would also like to mention the konjee lamb which is a star performer here.
This place is a great den if you are looking@ for some good chinese at cheap rates.
The best part is there is no tax or gst here, you spend the exact amount that's in the menu.
I would definetly recommended this place for chinese lovers.
This place gets a 'Must try' tag to be obvious.

Location:- if you r coming from golpark towards gariahat take the Bylane beside senco gold.. just walk for 2mins and this place is on your left just opposite the pc chandra jewellers outlet.. This place being a locality won't be a pblm for ur parking too...

We were there within 7.15pm but still we had to wait outside.. yes that's the craze of this place.. 

Ambience:- nothing extraordinary or mesmerising but still the dim lights.. The walls.. The frames.. The cutleries displayed will give you a homely feeling... just sit back and relax..

Food :- As we had snacks frm kfc just an hour ago.. so decided to directly jump to the main course..

1) Mixed Fried Rice :- first of all I would say the quantity is humungous.. its really huge.. enough to feed 2 very hungry souls.. in fact 3 people if you have starters..The taste was quite good if not very good.. With ample amount of chicken..eggs..prawns..

2)chilli chicken :- not much like the old house chilli chicken we have... It was not that spicy also.. but the gravy was really tasty... With chopped chillies sprinkled over the gravy... and mind you they served 11 pieces of chicken cubes.. so literally the portions are really satisfying...

3) schezwan chicken :- the show stealer.. It was simply superb.. One of the best schezwan chckn I have had in kolkata... The spicy gravy  with the aroma of the schezwan sauce.. The soft tender pieces of chicken.. A lipsmacking preperation..

Staff :- the service was quite prompt..overall a decent  service...

Pocket pinch :-  we had 3 mixed rice.. and two chicken gravy items and the bill was just 790.. yes.. its a really budget restaurant..

P:S they don't charge any gst or service charge...üòÄüòÄ

Do drop in and have some real good Chinese cuisine in a homely atmosphere without burning a hole in ur pocket..üòÖüòÖ

I visited this place with two friends on a weekend.
We ordered The Hot and Sour Soup for starters. It was satisfactory. Perhaps, I could say it was good.
For the main course, my friends agreed upon ordering ¬†
Teriyaki Duck, Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Garlic Chicken. I had only a bite of the duck, and I didn't like it at all. But as it was my first time, I am not the best judge.
The fried rice and chilly garlic chicken were too delicious. Well cooked, aromatic and sufficient in quantity.
The ambiance is soothing; A medium sized room hosts the tables.

Just a great place to taste Chinese..... The amount of both Chow and rice are just awesome.....more than enough for 2 person.... Chicken side dishes are also good.... Allover it's a place I have been in love and should go there more and more.... And the most important thing is there is no tax.... We ordered lemon chicken and 1 mixed Chow and 1 egg chicken fried rice.... Bill was only ‚Çπ457.... Unbelievable.... Must go and visit the place...

Well we landed here with a lot of expectations and this place didnt let us down.
Stands admist hindustan park almost close to gariahat.
This places offers good chinese dishes.
We ordered Chicken prawn gravy noodles, Schezuan chicken and wings in soya sause.
To the wonder all these dishes very good.
Schezuan did do the wonders , satisfied our taste buds to a great extent.
I didnt expect this place to be so go, definetly deserves a better recognition.
I would also like to mention the konjee lamb which is a star performer here.
This place is a great den if you are looking@ for some good chinese at cheap rates.
The best part is there is no tax or gst here, you spend the exact amount that's in the menu.
I would definetly recommended this place for chinese lovers.
This place gets a 'Must try' tag to be obvious.

Very well known restaurant in the gariahat area and serving chinese foods for a long time. Visited this place numerous time and really in love with it. Nothing special about the ambience but food is very tasty. Specially their chicken sweet corn soup, chicken lollypop, fried wonton, teriyaki chicken dry, golden chicken, mixed rice, sanghai noodles etc these are my favourite dishes. But last time we had a bad experience with the Sweet and sour prawn in schezwan style. It was made of small prawns prepared in round shaped balls. The prawns were hard and tasteless. So guys avoid their prawn preparation and if want to have prawn then ask the staffs clearly regarding this.

On a Saturday evening when we were in hurry and every other place was too full the name of Kinli crossed my mind. Situated opposite to Gariahat PC Chandra this is a popular joint among college goers. We ordered mixed cantonese gravy noodles, teriyaki fish and red pepper chilly garlic chicken. The staffs assisted us well while ordering. Teriyaki fish was best of the lot. It had a tangy and spicy flavour. The chicken dish was a bit spicy but tasted pretty well with cold drinks. Cantonese noodles was very light in taste compared to the other dishes. They serve a huge quantity which is enough for two people. The pricing was another reason for giving a thumbs up.

Been here numerous times,and the place seldom disappoints. This place is a must-go-to if you're looking for great Chinese food,in humongous amounts sans the pocket pinch. The service is prompt, ambience is good, and staff polite.
Their prawn chicken fried rice, dry chilli chicken , and hong Kong Chicken is good.

Went to the place after many years. But unfortunately it might be my last visit. Ordered the simplest menu that could be ordered. Egg and sweet corn soup, prawn fried rice and fish in white sauce.

The soup had way too much corn. But in general it was seasoned okay.

The fish item was decent. The fish pieces were irregular and sauce was way to less for the main course. A bit bland but edible

Fried rice was a disaster. They call it prawn fried rice. But it was smaller than shrimps. Uncleaned veins. AND FROZEN. ABSOLUTE FROZEN. Completely unedible. Had to keep the 'prawn's' aside. Prawn fried rice is as easy as any fried rice goes.

Now coming to servicing. Our server was as lethargic  as far lethargy goes. Did not care to serve us when good arrived. Also did not care to give us our bill either for a long time. 

It was an unfortunate experience. Might not visit again

Visited after a good¬†8 years just to have some Chimney Soup. The entrance and the place has shifted to another side in the same building. It is an old restaurant with standard Chinese stuff on the menu. I was expecting the soup to be served along with the Chimney but I was mistaken. It came on a Steel bowl with a serving spoon and soup bowls separately. Anyways, the taste was okay but a Chimney soup not being served with a chimney is a turn off.¬†No¬†I did not feel like taking out my camera for a click :(

This is a typical Chinese restaurant located conveniently at Golpark.It is on the by-lanes so it is removed from the bustle of the road.
I have been here numerous times and tried out a variety of dishes.The teriyaki duck deserves a special mention in this context.If you ever happen to be here dont give it a miss.I have also tried various lamb dishes and they are reasonable well except the crispy conji lamb which was not crispy enough.
I also tried out their mei foon during the pujas and did not like it much.I found it to be bland.Might be due to the puja rush.
The quantity of the rice is huge considering the price range and it is preferable to go with groups. You might need to pack if you are alone.
Post gst we found that the prices on the menu were including taxes which is a added bonus.Overall the prices are reasonable and the food typical Chinese.
If you find yourself in and around Golpark with and appetite and want to try out different kinds of meat at a reasonable price this is definitely a possible option to consider

The food quality and quantity wise good. We have ordered mix fried rice, dry chili chicken and honey chicken. Both fried rice and chili chicken is great. Though the chili chicken is quute spicy but you can have it. But the main concern for me is about honey chicken. Its not up to the mark. Eventhey just spread some honey on fried chicken. But this place is good for the college people to hang out or celebrate some ones birthday.

We have ordered chicken wanton, egg chicken fried rice, egg chicken chowmin, hot garlic chicken, manchurian chicken, lemon chicken.
My rating is low because the staffs are very casual and unprofessional. The first item we wanted was chilly garlic lollipop but it was unavailable.. and the most horrible part was a hair was found while the chowmin was being served. Anyways they changed the whole plate and the bowl of chowmin  immediately..
The food was tasty and average..
They have not added any GST. It was written composite gst scheme. This was good for those want budget food.

I would particularly write about this experience that we had on Wednesday afternoon (5-7-2017, around 1.30-2.00pm). Ours was a big office group of 8 members who just wanted to grab a quick lunch. As we were towards the end of finishing the food and were talking and joking amongst ourselves, the staff who came to clear the table said, "aste!", meaning, "don't laugh so loudly". We were all a bit taken aback by his behaviour and could not comprehend as to what made him say that. Nor were we creating any disturbance and neither did anyone present in the restaurant show any form of annoyance.
To think of it, if even a place to eat starts dictating your code of conduct, where is a person expected to unwind then?
An experience, which was uncalled for. Now we would think twice before paying them a visit again. Not in the mood to be silenced you see.

I had been longing to be at Kimli for long, especially because I heard loads about it from my young friends :) I being an old hag was skeptical if I would like something which they adore! But Kimli is a sweet little eating house, a comfy hide-out and heavenly abode for oriental food lovers. But I must say there is lack of consistency which I will discuss later in this review. The place has an old world charm, pretty humble yet cozy. The servers are prompt and optimally friendly! We ordered for chicken lollipops, chicken steamed momo, chicken Hong Kong mushroom soup, chicken hakka noodles, and special duck teriyaki. Frankly speaking I was pretty impressed with the lollipops which I generally avoid at many places due to negligible amount of meat present in them, but here the case wasn't like that! They were juicy, meaty, nicely marinated and very garlicky! The plate was loaded with saut√©ed chopped green chilies which was pretty typical of this place I must say! The steamed momos were nice, though it was tad dry, not very juicy and I won't order momos here for sure. The soup was a revelation, and I loved even the last drop of it, it was the best dish I had at Kimli. It almost resembled the chicken wanton soup of Tung Nam (which I simply adore)!  The chicken Hakka noodle was nice and had generous amount of chicken pieces in it, the quantity was huge. A plate is good enough for two. The special duck teriyaki was a massive let down, the proportion of meat in there was microscopic and it was loaded with cornflower coating all over! The dry gravy was pretty flavourful though and was the saving grace of this supposedly exotic dish! Reason why my young friends love this place is the pocket pleasing pricing which can't be denied. I will rate this place 7 out of 10 keeping all the mentioned points in mind. If you haven't tried yet, do try out this place.

Cheers!

Kimli never disappoints you with the quality of the food they serve. All the items are always fresh. Never complained about an item ever. Do not forget to try their Chicken Lollipop, Red Paper Chilli Garlic Fish, Chicken or Prawn fried Wantons, mixed cantonese noodles and lung fung soup. Must try for all!

If u r bored of chicken den u cn mk a visit here to hv a delicious bite of lamb or duck . As u can see the restaurant hv a plenty variety of their food menu. The restaurant serves one of the best lamb and duck dishes in an authentic chinese way within ur budget. The sitting capacity is nt sufficient as my opinion bt the chinese decor maintain the perfect harmony with its cuisine. We hd ordered chicken wonton , schezwan rice nd hot garlic lamb. The lamb pieces wr soft , tender nd juicy bt the gravy ws little bit spicy , truly deservs the tittle 'hot' ! As the chilly flavour ws so strng that the other flavours wr suppressed by it. Bt the rice ws truly delicious , full of flavours, hv the perfecr proportion of all spices nd sauces. The chicken wonton ws crispy too. Bt the food service ws slow nd lazy , we hd to wait near abt 20 mints to gt our frst dish though the restaurant ws almost empty . Whatever i wanna visit there agn to taste their duck in an authentic chinese style.

This is a small and cozy restaurant in between Gariahat & Golpark, opposite to PC Chandra. 

Food Ordered :- 
1. Chilly Lamb  2.Coriander Chicken. 3.Mixed Fried Rice
Total Cost :- ‚Çπ. 630

Let's talk about the pro's:-
‚úì Price's are very reasonable.
‚úì You will get food any time after it opens like I went around 5:30 pm and I was Served food unlike few food joints which is closed after 3:30 pm & again starts around 6:30 pm.
‚úì Very Prompt Service.
‚úì Quantity of Food is also very much except for the Chilli Lamb which was served pretty less.
‚úì Taste wise it is also good.
 
Con's
‚úì The waiter who served us was damn lethargic and just brought us the food, he didn't have the enthusiasm to serve it in the plates.
‚úìTaste can be better.

Verdict :- If you are near Gariahat & your stomach craves for some Chinese also keeping in mind your end of the month financial condition, this is the best place to have some gobble! Ambience is not cool but it is a small & cozy restaurant where you can beat the summer heat with some good Chinese food without facing the heat of the bills even.

An average Chinese family restaurant, I've been there quite a number of times. The food served is here is not exceptional but doesn't disappoint as well.
The soups, they serve are in huge portions and taste good enough.
The starters are crispy and fresh. Especially the Chilli garlic chicken dry is really well prepared.  I didn't like the crispy babycorn it seemed a little too much fried.
Their noodles, main course Chicken items like the Chicken in oyster sauce, Chilli chicken and chicken Manchurian tasted fine but not very good.
I didn't like the gravy noodles, the gravy seemed bland and tasteless.
The chilly paneer wasn't up to the mark either.
Ambience: Nothing worth mentioning just a good place to eat with family or  treating friends.
Service: it was okay
There was some trouble during card payment although I suppose that was temporary.
Overall, visit only if you are in the locality and want to have Chinese at an affordable price.

Eight of us went there on Sunday for dinner. We ordered the following:

Starters:
‚àö Kung Pao Chicken
‚àö Honey chicken
‚àö Garlic Fish (*4)

Garlic fish was the best among them for which we ordered it 4 plates.

Main course:

‚àö Mixed fried rice(*3)
‚àö Mixed Mein Foon
‚àö Coriander chicken
‚àö Chilli garlic tiger prawn
‚àö Teriyaki fish

In the main course each and every dish was awesome specially the prawn preparation.

Their service was also very prompt.

And when it comes to price you will be surprised to know that all of these dishes cost us 2942/- which is around 373/- per head.

Located near Murlidhar girls college. Just opposite to P.C. Chandra Jewelers. The place is decorated well and is famous for it's Chinese. I hopped in there with my friends. Ordered veg fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Since the place was relatively empty our orders did not take much time to be delivered to our tables. I loved the taste of the fried rice. However, the chicken was cooked along with veggies like cucumber, papaya. I never heard of such a preparation. The quantity is good and two bowls of rice will be enough for 3 people. And 10 pieces chicken in a plate. What more to ask for? Though I have some issues with the preparation of chicken, it's overall a nice place if you're running low on budget and craving some Chinese.

After a hectic walk in the hot summer afternoon in the last week of May we finally decided to experiment Kimli. Kimli was suggested to us by one of my dear friends and as per his version The restaurant has fulfilled all the expectations we had. A pocket friendly air conditioned tiny Chinese restaurant in South Kolkata offering a greater quantity of food at affordable prices.

This is my all time favourite place. It's advisable to visit when there is no rush. Quality of food is awesome and quantity is sufficient to serve 2 people  (if not more).  I didn't like their Banshpora item but all other items which i keep on trying from time to time, are awesome.  Moreover, I don't think nowhere in Kolkata duck meat is so cheap and delicious. 

Ambience is peaceful  (except for Durga Puja days when you need to wait to get a table,  in a queue)

Cosy, cost-effecting, comfortable and candid. An ideal place to grab risk-free Chinese in sumptuous quantities at affordable price. Ideal for a catch-up, second date (when there's no need to impress but there's  a need know and understand), no parking hassles even at peak hours. Good staff, neither bothers you unnecessarily nor aloof. 
Stick to the usual, chili-chicken dry is recommended.

Another Chinese restaurant in the southern part of the city this one serves delectable dishes to its customers at a very reasonable price. I was strolling in the area when I came across kimli and being the food aficionado that I am it was hard to resist myself from entering the restaurant. A cozy little place which has a typical Chinese feel with its red backdrop and Chinese decor. With a heavy heart I ordered vegetarian food that day as I give rest to my stomach by not eating non vegetarian on Mondays. The veg garlic noodles was brilliant and I must say I didn't feel that I was having a vegetarian item. The chilly mushroom was yummy. I loved the food so much that I got it packed for home as well. The taste lingers and I am visiting this place to gorge on to the non vegetarian items very soon.

Tucked in the bylanes near gariahat rashbehari this place serves good Chinese food in affordable prices. Tried their green fried rice and duck in teriyaki sauce. The green fried rice was good with ample vegetables, mushrooms and chicken. The duck in terriyaki sauce was crispy and succulent, well cooked. They serve enormous quantity at a reasonable price. One portion of dishes are enough to tame the hunger of 2people, that is heavy eaters. It will easily serve 3 moderate eaters. Overall good food in affordable prices.

This is an authentic Chinese restaurant in Golpark. I have been visiting this place since my school days. So I went to this place with my friends after quite a long time. The decor has changes a lot and the seating areas have also changed and they have increased the space. 
We ordered mixed hakka noodles and a chicken side dish. It has this traditional taste which can't be explained. I love their food. The service is also commendable along with the quantity. We ordered 3 for 5 of us. It was quite filling. 
The ambience is good. The service is impressive. The food is amazing and the quantity is commendable. It never fails to impress me every time. I love to keep going back their and repeat the dishes as many times I want.

It was 3rd time visit to Kimli on 30. 04. 17.The experience was a trash.I requested for a table shift but the waiter did not allowed me to do that. After that, I ordered Singapore Noodles and Spicy Chicken.  Food was below standard. Prawns in Singapore Noodles are rotten and pungent smell loomed when the Singapore noodles came to me. Too much spice in Singapore noodles, because I previously ate that. Chicken were invisible. The bistro staffs were busy in seeing IPL in the kitchen room. Washroom was also filthy.

I have visited this place 3 times. 

Their food is really good. Ambiance is also good.

I have tried their red pepper chilli garlic chicken which is really great. For the first time I tried this dish it was too good. So it decided to order it again during the second visit. 

But I was disappointed a bit then. Chicken pieces were little overcooked and extra salty. Still I would recommend this as from my first experience.

I have also tried Special Green Hakka and Special green Cantonese(Gravy style). Both the items are too good and highly recommended.

Also I have tried Teriyaki Chicken and Hunan Chicken which were not overwhelming but good.

Most important part is that the restaurant is very much pocket friendly. Food quantity is also adequate.

A must try place.

The place is moderately crowded but you can easily get a place. You can also come in groups of four.

So, if you want to try some Chinese cuisine at an affordable rate, I would highly recommend this palce.

Visited the place hearing about the amazing duck preparation. However, I was a little disappointed, since I felt the meat was a little undercooked and too full of the sauce. I had ordered the Teriyaki Duck and the portion was too much for a single person. The other two people along with me were unwilling to have it, and were very much content with their Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Garlic Chicken. The Hot and Sour Soup we had prior to that was pretty good as well. Overall, this is a nice joint, charging less for huge portions of good food - an ideal place to come with a large gang and low budget.

If I have to speak about its location...I must say that it's very annoying to find out the joint if u ppl are coming from kalighat metro station side..! DO NOT TAKE THAT ROUTE.... But it's easy to find out from Golpark side..! Now coming to the main thing.. one of the best place serving some great mouth watering delicacies in Golpark area!.. price is reasonable.. quantity is fair.. and the quality is awesome..!

One of my all time favourites. Kimli is an archetypal pocket friendly restaurant. Located near Golpark, this restaurant is a student favourite. It offers delicious food with a good ambience , friendly service all at a throwaway price. 
I've been here far too many times to give a review on a particular dish. But yes , the coriander chicken , Thai soup and the chilli garlic noodles deserve a special mention here. 
Add to that the quantity is superb. 
Kimli is a hidden gem in the otherwise posh locality and deeply attached to my childhood. Here's hoping it stays that way forever.

Visited the place hearing about the amazing duck preparation. However, I was a little disappointed, since I felt the meat was a little undercooked and too full of the sauce. I had ordered the Teriyaki Duck and the portion was too much for a single person. The other two people along with me were unwilling to have it, and were very much content with their Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Garlic Chicken. The Hot and Sour Soup we had prior to that was pretty good as well. Overall, this is a nice joint, charging less for huge portions of good food - an ideal place to come with a large gang and low budget.

One of the best chinese restraunts in Golpark area. Though its a bit in the interiors but the mouth watering delicacies make up for it. We had ordered fried rice, drumsticks and shanghai chicken. The service is prompt and food was just delicious.. worth visiting!

Been there last week while returning from Gariahat..! If I have to speak about its location...I must say that it's very annoying to find out the joint if u ppl are coming from kalighat metro station side..! DO NOT TAKE THAT ROUTE.... But it's easy to find out from Golpark side..! Now coming to the main thing.. one of the best place serving some great mouth watering delicacies in Golpark area!.. price is reasonable.. quantity is fair.. and the quality is awesome..! Would love to visit this place over and over again..! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED..!

One of my all time favourites. Kimli is an archetypal pocket friendly restaurant. Located near Golpark, this restaurant is a student favourite. It offers delicious food with a good ambience , friendly service all at a throwaway price. 
I've been here far too many times to give a review on a particular dish. But yes , the coriander chicken , Thai soup and the chilli garlic noodles deserve a special mention here. 
Add to that the quantity is superb. 
Kimli is a hidden gem in the otherwise posh locality and deeply attached to my childhood. Here's hoping it stays that way forever.

A small but good and pocket friendly restaurant according to me.Food quality and the ambiance is too good.But as I already mentioned it's a small restaurant.After some time you will feel suffocating.
But if we ignore that it's a very good restaurant.

The rating I gave to this place solely based on the Chinese food. This is one of the best Chinese restaurants by far in the Golpark-Garihat area. From the gOlpark crossing take the opposite road of Grub Club upon crossing the petrol pump you will have to take the second diversion (if you are coming from Jadavpur) in Purna Das road and walk till the end of that gali¬†(you will leave 'Bedwin' on your way) to reach over there, it will be on the right-hand side.
The ambiance is very homely. I was stunned initially by the collection of paintings and hand crafted things they used for decoration. we went there long back (nearly six months), We ordered two plates of mixed fried rice, 3 soups, one chili potato (with a bit gravy) and chili duck. The fried rice was huge in amount but pretty average in taste. Chili duck was out of the world (it influenced my rating to the higher side, if not I might give it 3stars only). The service was good. Later I visit this January, I found service quality has gone down.
A pocket-friendly Chinese place to hang out with your friends/family for lunch specially. Won't recommend it for dinner.

It is located near Golpark and we were able to locate this place easily, thanks to Google maps üôà. The ambience of this place is neither too good nor too bad, its just okay. The service is good and the staffs are good. Coming to the food we ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles and Special Schezwan Duck. The taste of the food was good, but the duck was a bit undercooked. The noodles were perfect and the taste was good. 
Would like to visit this place again to try their remaining items as well !

A decent place to go with friends and family(I prefer to take parcel though). The foods are good. Try the chicken or prawn preparations, the duck and lamb preparations are not always that good. 
Chicken Thai noodles is one of my favourites, it's too spicy though. If you like spicy foods then try this one, with chicken teriyaki or chicken in oyster sauce. Or you can go with any of the rice preparations, they all taste good. 
The ambiance is a bit dull and gloomy. Not so vibrant and they take a lot of time to prepare the food. That's one huge drawback for this place.
I would recommend this place for foods only.

Its been a couple of times that I have visited this place. Both the times the experience has been good. I don't remember much about what I had last time but it was non veg and today I tried all veg items.

For the starter we had crispy chilli baby corn which tasted good. Then we had veg Singapore noodles with paneer Manchurian. The noodles tasted very good but a bit too hot and the paneer Manchurian was okay. One plate of noodle is enough for two people. Looks can be deceiving so at first when you see the utensil in which they serve the noodles you may think its not gonna be sufficient but trust me its more than enough.

All in all kimli is a nice place to have lunch or dinner with family or friends. The stuffs are courteous and the ambience is also pleasant. Also its quite easy going on the pocket.

Staffs are well behaved and service is quick. Menu was quite large with lots of items to offer. We ordered Crispy konje lamb for starter and mixed Cantonese with chili chicken for the main course. Foods were nicely cooked and delicious. Pocket pinch is very reasonable. Overall it is a nice family restaurant.

I have been going to Kimli¬†pretty regularly for more than 5 years now. I love this place because of it's pocket -friendly delicacies. They get the flavours right most of the time and the quantity is pretty good for the price. There are a lot of items on Menu and most are available all the time. ¬†Try duck and lamb as they are specialities of the place. Also, if you like soup, have the large bowl with a starter. Reason why I rated it 4 is because it's not the best Chinese food out there and I am kinda bored because I have tried out almost everything here. I just need a change of taste.

Had been to this place on saraswati puja. I had heard about this place from many people but never really managed to visit. Well this was one lucky day. Lucky i say because man this place is just awesome!! Coming straight to the food... we had ordered for:
Crispy konjee lamb- to be precise it was too good! 
A soup (whose name i forgot)- too good again. 
Mixed fried rice- we were a group of 7 and could not finish 3 plates of the rice. The portions are HUGE. And to top it we had ordered for 4 plates. All the ingredients were given generously and in the right balance. 
Spicy red curry chicken- they give you 11 pieces in a plate. What else do you need?! I liked this preparation as well. 
Manchurian- nothing to complain here. Perfect. And i liked this one better than the one mentioned above. 
The service very really prompt and courteous. They kept checking on us every now and then. 
Ambience is also very cozy. 
Complete thumbs up. üëç
Can't wait to visit again.

This place felt like the inside of my soul, or what other people may call: dark. What's with the dim lighting anyway? And what's with the dropped shutter? Doesn't it harm their business?
Getting to the food, it was nothing out of the ordinary. One of those "safe" places you would want to go to when you absolutely can't take a risk.

Wanted to try some authentic Chinese soup, so decided to give this place a visit. The sight of this place from outside gives you a very traditional Chinese feel to it which was upheld beautifully by the decor inside. Took the medium sized Chimney soup and it tasted fantastic. It had a wide range of ingredients in it starting from shrimp to other kinds of seafood. The medium sized Chimney soup would easily suffice 4-5 people.

A very well known old Chinese restaurant, with a moderate decor which is mostly visited by families. So, The food we had here was really tasty and that too at a cheap price when we dropped in at this place for a late lunch.
We ordered for red pepper chicken, mixed Cantonese noodles and schezwan duck. The starter was not what the name suggests, it should be rather called green pepper chicken(suggestion) and it was a bit salty but the quantity was huge and chicken pieces perfectly soft.
Mixed Cantonese and schezwan duck was a big surprise after the starter from this place and no wonder why this place is still so popular! Duck was perfectly cooked and the gravyof noodles was of proper consistency with ample of chicken prawns and crisp veggies.
A big thumbs up for this place for serving brilliant food at such moderate rates at today's date.

For starters, we ordered Crispy Fried chicken. They took almost 20 minutes to serve this one dish. It tasted okay - nothing very special about it. For the main course, we ordered chicken fried rice, mixed noodles, and garlic chicken gravy. I didn't taste the mixed noodles, so I won't be commenting on that. The Chicken Fried rice wasn't that good - it had more onion in it than chicken. Didn't like this dish at all. The Garlic Chicken gravy was okay. They have more pieces of chicken (12 or so).

Value for money, but the food isn't good. This place was suggested to me by many of my friends. It's overrated.

The place is located just opposite to the golpark P.C Chandra Jewellers showroom. A quaint little place with dim lighting and soothing ambience. When we went there yesterday at around 2.30pm the place was almost full. Now coming to the food we ordered for Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken as starter then for main course we ordered Chicken and Prawn Friend Rice and Lamb in Hoisin Sauce.

The Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken was tasty but someone it lacked the proper taste of what the dish should have been. It didn't have bell peppers. Insted there was only green chillis and a few red chillis. It was good though not perfect. 

The Chicken And Prawn Fried Rice- this was the tastiest of all. It had large chicken strips and adequate number of prawns. And it was very flavoursome. 

The Lamb In Hoisin Sauce- this dish was a disaster for me. It was too much on the sweeter side which i hate the most.  So anyone out there not found of sweet tasting main course don't even think of ordering. It will ruin your entire mood.

Now coming to the service, the service was promt. And the place is quite reasonable. The bill came out to be Rs.623 which is not heavy on the pocket for two people.
Would like to visit again to taste other dishes. üòä

Located opposite to PC Chandra Jewellers Golpark this place is quite a gem. Dim lights and cozy interiors make the perfect ambience to enjoy food. Although due to its awesome service it's never empty. We tried the schezwan duck and it's highly recommend for all you people to have.Thai soup here is one of the best i have ever have, crab prawn and other seafood with a tiny essence of lemon is just mouthwatering. Gravy rice known as chow chow rice is a pretty great dish. Cantonese gravy make a light blissful texture while a spicy side dish like ours goes very well with it. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Although the staff need to be little more courteous and professional. Service is indeed quick and food quantity and quality is pleasing as per the price is concerned.

I must say, a fabulous taste of Chinese I had at such a place which I never knew until my friend suggested me to go there and I was very impressed by the food, the service and as per the price they do put a lot in your plate maintaining quality food too! 
The location to be exact, just before you are about to take the Gariahat flyover after going around the Golpark structure, take the left turn and head straight till you reach end and you will find it at your right hand side. Don't confuse it with the Purna Das road street which is beside the petrol pump!
I went there during the Durga Puja, it was overcrowded, then I thought we came in bad time and we will get under-cooked food or bad food. I was so wrong! they took about say 20mins of time to arrange a table and by 15mins. or so they gave everything what we ordered and the taste, its simply fantastic!! 
The place is nice, decent ambience and don't have that space crunch at all!
Blown away and overwhelmed by the great taste of Chinese and the varieties! Some of the dishes I tried, green chili chicken, golden fish,¬† chicken cantonese chow, and some other chicken dish which might be red chili pepper sauce or black pepper sauce. But anyway, price wise its really a great treat to your tummy and I bet if they could manage such good food during pujas also, they can maintain this throughout! Really satisfied, just go ahead and grab your grub!!

Located on Purnadas Road, towards Golpark opposite PC Chandra and Chandrani Pearls showroom. I have been to this place a number of times. It's a nice homely and family restaurant where families can enjoy their authentic Chinese meal. It's also a nice place for a group outing with friends. Ambience is ok, location is great and the food is really good. Had gone for take away this Sunday. Ordered mixed hakka chow, mixed rice and schezwan chicken. The rice and noodles were good. The schezwan chicken was spicy as expected. All in all a good Sunday dinner. Price is reasonable, as compared to the other chinese food joints in and around that stretch. Overall if one is low on cash and want chinese one could go for it.

They serve Chinese delicacies at a very reasonable price which comes with a quantity sufficient for 2-3.
We ordered for:-
1. Chicken fried wantons- 10/10
2. Veg chilli garlic noodles- 8/10
3. Schezewan fish- 10/10
Add ons- 3 soft drinks.

Best chicken wantons ever! Crispy and yummy.
The noodles missed out on the flavour of garlic a little bit but then they were sumptuous and tasty nonetheless.

Schezewan fish was amazing. Soft and flavoured to the optimum.

The total bill was around ‚Çπ560/- inclusive of taxes.

It's really reasonable but doesn't miss out on the taste.

P.S- the ambience could be a turnoff for some people.

This is one of the old legendary Chinese joints in South Kolkata. Located in the quiet neighbourhood at the Poorna Das road crossing, it's been serving decent Chinese food since ages. Nice homely feeling around and you'd find the most inexpensive delicious Chinese cuisine. 

Suggestions - 
Try the chilli chicken skewers. 
Pan fried noodles are great. 
American Chopsuey is cool too, but I've found it better in some other places. 
The green chilli fish was awesome. 
The sweet n sour chicken was super too.

Right now the best pocket friendly chinese restuarant in kolkata. The quantity of food served is very filling for two people. Specially the side dishes can be shared by three persons.

Ordered food over phone and picked up some Cantonese noodles on November 5th. When cane back home and opened the packets the quantity we saw was shocking. It was barely adequate. When called to tell them that the quantity is less because it was a take away, they denied upfront. Kimli is an old restaurant and has always served quite nice food. But very disappointed with this kind of pathetic  service and the intention to cheat on customers.

Great food at really awesome prices. Been here several times, most recently during the Durga puja this year. There were 7 6 of us, and we had our fill at 190 bucks per head. That's how awesome the prices are here. Ordered a mixed fried rice, chicken scezwan rice, a chicken noodle, a golden chicken, a garlic chicken, and a green chilli chicken. Quality was really good, portion sizes fantastic. Always a delight visiting this little place.

If you want to experience good Chinese food with pocket friendly rates then you must visit this restaurant. Ambience is average and tables are also relatively too simple, not so decorative. Starters are delicious. Taste of the main course items are perfect and quantity is enough. Considering the prices it is one of the best place to have Chinese food in South Kolkata.

A lot of positive reviews instigated me to order from them through swiggy.It was a very disappointing experience oveall. Ordered chicken spring rolls and chicken drimstick for starters which was really tasty and authentic to taste which are the only reason to give them 2.5 points. For maincourse ordered chicken meifoon noodles , mixed fried rice , american chopsuey, mandarin fish , and some prawn item whose name i dont remember. Firstly coming to the prawn item which was full of shrimps( not prawns) with red curry and it had a smell which was not at all nice. Mandarin fish was okeyish. Both the rice and noodles were nothing special but the american chopsuey was good. Overall a bad experience.

Kimli is a small restaurant near golpark with a seating capacity of 9 or 10 tables. I have been a frequent visitor of this place because i somehow find it reasonable and food is average. if u compare the food with its pricing then it is okay.
Few of the signature dishes that i have tried in here are-¬†
1. sweet corn soup
2. Gravy Noodles
3. Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken for starters
4. Sweet and Sour Fish
5. Fresh lime soda
The dishes are not out of the world but will suit your taste buds absolutely fine.¬†
Sometimes service is extremely fast and sometimes poor so cannot say much on that.¬†
There is nothing much to say about the ambience because it is nothing great but is fully airconditioned.¬†
Since it is a common eating place for me i would like to suggest you all to try it once when your pocket is not supporting you for anything expensive.¬†

Thank you

It's a good place to hangout and have good food. The price range is also reasonable but I really doubt about the hygiene of the place. We ordered an American Choupsey and we found hair there. We complained about it. The waiter changed it and we found hair there too. It's really disappointing and we complained again but the waiter didn't pay any attention.

Excellent food and every food items at a much affordable price makes the outlet a spell bound. Fish in red spicy sauce and Cantonese Noodles was the best of best among all. The location is also quite easy to find. Serving was good also. Above all in such a small well decorated outlet they manage to serve very good quality Chinese dishes, which most of the restros in South Calcutta cannot serve.

Nice, affordable place to have Chinese food. We were a group of six and the total bill for our dinner was a little over 900 bucks. 

We tried Mixed American Chopsuey which came with a rich gravy and made for a sumptuous dinner in itself. Also, we tried Hunan fish and Hunan chicken about which we were a bit apprehensive since they are supposed to be spicy. But they were perfect and the pieces were quite soft and savoury.

The time taken for service and availability of tables was the only bummer. But that might be because we went there during the pujas when it's a nightmare to get a seat in a restaurant. We had to wait for about half an hour after getting our names written, and even after we got a table, we had to wait another 15-20 minutes to get our order delivered. However, we didn't mind the delay because of the puja rush and the food kinda made up for it. It's a well-known restaurant in the neighbourhood and a popular jaunt for students.

Visited yesterday to have lunch with my wife. Food quality was average but ambiance & hospitality were not up to the mark. I ordered dry red pepper chilli garlic chicken for starter but they served chicken pakoras instead of the mentioned one. They told that this is the preparation they serve as ¬†dry red pepper chilli garlic chicken. Also ordered egg fried rice and Fish Manchurian. Rice was good but they served chicken Manchurian instead of fish, but they replaced it after been asked.¬†Prices are reasonable but I am not satisfied overall .....

When pujo us around its practically next to impossible to find a restaurant to tuck in without having to wait for an eternity. We decided for Kimli as it was comparatively less crowded and zomato ratings looked promising. However even on sashthi we had to wait for about half n hour before we could enter. The place is divided into two sections one for couples and one for family dining. A thumbs up for this. They have introduced a special menu for the puja ( i felt the original menu was way better ) and after a lot of contemplation we ordered mixed Hakka noodles, Singapore noodles, Hong Kong chicken and lemon fish. All the items were pretty average. Quantity wise satisfactory. Quality needs to improve a lot. Overall a very very ordinary restro. Maybe it was due to the rush of the puja that the quality of food was not up to the mark. I'll give it a try again sometimes.

Whatever, coming to the food part we ordered chicken clear soup that was okayish, chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. The quantity of the rice was good as we had troubles finishing it even after taking a single plate. The garlic chicken was delicious. Overall a nice place and pocket-friendly too.

So finally we set our long awaited sight on this small yet satisfying chinese joint..the place is conveniently located amongst a string of other restros in that area..we had fried chicken for starters..average at best and could have been much tender..followed it up by mixed fried rice,mixed hakka chow alongside teriyaki duck and garlic prawns..the quantity was huge for our group of 3..perhaps the only thing to brag about..the quality is below par bt considering the price it could have been a tad better..worth a single visit!

Visited this place today after getting suggestions from friends that it is very pocket friendly and provides tangra style chinese. And they were absolutely true . The ambience and service was okay but the food was very tasty. Based on the price the quantity was quite good. We were four so we ordered Fried spring chicken , Singapore hakka chow, chicken hakka chow and and hunan chicken. We loved the Singapore hakka chow and the hunan chicken . And as we went during the pujas we thought the standard of food would detoriate but we were proved wrong . I would definitely come here again.

Kimli was marked as a hidden gem by most of the reviews. I'd beg to differ though. The experience was good but none to remember thoroughly. 
Tucked away in the alleys of Hindustan Park and there are way better places in that area. 
Ambience was good, didn't speak too loud though.
Food decent.
Had chicken hakka chow and spicy chicken. 
Chicken pieces were however hard. And noodles were very ordinary. And it is pocket friendly which holds an advantage. All that took us Rs. 350 including taxes.
The staff had been nice to us. Grades to their hospitality.

Visited this place on multiple occasions. Usually prefer to have Noodles than Fried rice because the quality of the rice is not very good. Among the side dishes i like Red pepper chilli garlic chicken, Chicken in spicy red sauce , kung pao chicken and konji crispy lamb. Their duck preparations aren't very good. Ambience is decent and service is satisfactory.

This eatery serves the Chinese delicacies in Tangra style at a very reasonable rate. Love their all types of non-veg soups specially the thai and the fish soup. My all time favorites are the starters - chilli fish and chicken drumsticks tossed with huge portions of green chillis.Momos are the must ones to try out.

Any decent restaurant would hv apologised and made arrangements to replace the food..

Kinli is located near Murlidhar Girls College, Gariahat and just opposite P.C Chandra Jewellers. We went there for a birthday lunch. Food was satisfactory and priced reasonably. We tried three different types of chicken preparation and mixed fried rice. Quantity of the dishes are good. All in all we were satisfied with their service.

Tucked in one of alleys of hindustan park, near murli dhar girls college and opposite to the pc chandra and chandrani pearls showroom, kimli is truly a hidden gem and should definitely be in a Chinese lovers itinerary.

A dimly lit, clean and well maintained restaurant with a simple ambience, kimli was on my list for a long time and I finally got the chance today to visit this place. Now coming to the food we had ordered :

Red chilli garlic pepper lollipop - They serve 10 pieces in one plate and it was well cooked,, not overly crunchy and neither to soft, it was perfectly cooked.

Chicken fried rice - one plate was enough to suffice the two of us but i felt that the fried rice could have been a bit better, the rice was abit hard and it should have been cooked a little longer.

Chilli garlic chicken - 11 well cooked proportionate pieces of chicken in a plate

The only drawback i found during our visit was the service, it lacked a certain degree of professionalism.
if you are looking for some good Chinese food, with alot of variety then you should definitely visit this place, oh and I forgot to mention, it's pocket friendly too!

Kimli had been on my top go to list for ages. I had heard lots of things about it from an array of sources. One evening while craving for 'tangra' style Chinese, and being to lazy to actually go to tangra I picked up the phone an ordered to my heart's content from Kimlis.

Firstly, it's so so cheap, I was amazed. Secondly the food is made with good quality ingredients, which is rare among cheap restaurants.

I ordered Mixed fried rice, Green Chicken fried rice, Mandarin fish, chili chicken. Firstly everything was fresh and was well packed. The rice items were excellent. While some may complain they are oily, I think that's the charm of of the old school 'bengali' or 'tangra' style Chinese. The rice were filled with chicken, egg, prawn.
The side dishes weren't too spicy, and tasted simple & elegant. The fish was fantastic and was the show stopper of my evening. The chili chicken had chunks of broadly cut chili's and tasted frankly old school. I loved everything and I gorged. And even after gorging I didn't feel overstuffed or too much of oil, etc.

Had a lovely dinner. #dinedazzledive

Kimli is everything a good Kolkata Chinese Joint should be - located in the midst of shopping cacophony of Gariahat, it serves heart quantities of food at very reasonable price. That's all that is to the place, for me - basically !

Came to this place long back for a late lunch with a friend of mine. We had Mixed Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken. It was really good. The portions are humongous enough to feed three adults fully. Food is good overall.

Went there with lot of expectations but I am dissapointed very much. The ambiance is nothing to mention...dim lights,full ac...sitting arrangements were okayish..the staffs were busy in talking to themselves and unprofessional. Nothing fancy about this place...We asked one of the waiters how many pieces of chicken are served in a gravy dish...he didn't bother to answer us and went.

 So now comes tge food...we ordered chicken lollipop...the sizes were decent,one plate contained 10pieces... it was tasty and spicy,but too much oily...and served with lots of chillies meaninglessly.

 For main course we ordered fried rice,kung pao chicken,thai chicken and duck teriyaki. The amount of fried rice was good,but it was dull in taste..less in salt. 
The quantity of both the chicken dishes were not satisfying...I have had kung pao chicken earlier in many other restros. It tasted nothing like that...only some fried chicken with whole gingers,red chilli and cashewnuts. I didn't like it at all. 
The thai chicken was better than this.. but not authentic thai chicken with lots of chilli flexs. It tasted like sweet and sour chicken with lots of unnecessary use of different sos..but better than kung pao chicken though. 
Then comes the duck teriyaki...I had lot of hopes for this dish.. the amount and sizes of pieces were decent..the gravy was okayish..lacking flavours oviously. 

So I was dissapointed totally after having this kind of lunch...we wanted to have some dessert after main course,and they told us dessert is not available at kimli. So well...not at all a gd experience.nthe bill came 1380 something.. it was pocket friendly for 7people...but the taste is all that matters to me when I am visiting any restro.. And kimli dissapointed me oviously...  never visiting this place again.

So far in my life if i've been disappointed by anything in life, then it has to be this one - KIMLI.
Nothing else comes even remotely close to this

Location : If u r coming adjacent to the Murlidhar Girls college right opposite to the Golpark-end of the Gariahat flyover, then take a left and u can find this place...

Interiors n ambience : nothing ho-hum but i like d concept that how dis residential place has been turned into a proper restaurant.

Coming to the food, we 3 friends decided to hop in for some authentic chinese cuisine n quality time..
We went full starters...!!!!

We asked the waiter for the signature dishes and he recommended the Red chilli pepper fish, honey chicken and chilli garlic prawns.
Others included fish fingers, sliced fish in white sauce, button mushrooms and babycorn.
Well, each of them was a DISASTER....!!!!!!
The honey chicken had more of caramelised honey than chicken. Pun intended, it can even put the best of desserts to shame.
All the other dishes had green chillies in quantities enough to run a whole month in Cuba. Plus the amount of oil used is shocking..!!
The prawn starters barely had any prawns in it. The fish fingers was better off being sold as 5 rupee fries in the kolkata streets..
All over, it was a SHAME..!!!!

I had huge huge expectations coming to this place, but it all went downhill..
Moreover, when we complained about the food to the management, they hardly bothered to listen

NEVER EVER COMING BACK...!!!!!!

I've been here plenty of times. The food is standard, nothing so great. 
I've had their soups and they are a little bland. You need to fill it up with salt, pepper, ketchups and vinegar to make it taste good, which isn't a good thing. 
The main course is pretty decent. However the service is really lackluster. The waiters do not approach the table until asked to, do not serve water (they didn't realize it halfway through the meal when we asked them for water). Price is reasonable though, and quantity generous.

A small eatery, near Golpark, the place is one of the best when comes to "quality and quantity". Let not its small chamber and dim lights disappoint you because its food will never! Try their Special Green chow chow rice, Mixed American Chopsuey, claws teriyaki, red pepper chicken, coriander chicken! The place will provide you with the best of "Indian-Chinese" with almost no whole in your pocket.

Ordered in food from Kimli for the first time. I haven't even visited this place in person but I must say, their food is great. Ordered via Swiggy, the food was piping hot and packaged very well and delivered on time.
I ordered one plate of chicken red pepper chilli garlic lollipop, korean fried rice and stir fried chicken. 1 plate of the lollilop had 10 pieces and quantity of the korean fried rice was more than enough for 2ppl. Reasonably priced too.  The food was amazing, especially the korean fried rice. The chicken dishes were soft, succulent and delicious. Highly recommend them for home delivery of some great Chinese.

After seeing moderate reviews in Zomato me and a friend of mine decided to pay this placea visit. I have to say I felt this place was probably not as good as the reviews might have suggested. The food was a disappointment to me. The chicken meifoon was not welcoming. The chicken was stiff and the dish itself had no such taste, had to add a generous amount of seasoning on it. The chicken fried rice was a bit better, but still not what you would come back for. The schezwan duck was an absolute disaster. It did not taste good, the spices and the meat had not mixed well, the duck itself was hard and to top it all 2/3d of it was bone. I gave it a rating of 2 because of the decor and the service. But if you are a restaurant and do not have good food to offer, ancillary thing will only save you so much.

Mixed Hakka Noodles
Mixed Cantonese Noodles
Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce
Fish in White Sauce 

Kungpao Chicken : Fried Chicken preparation - chicken chunks , cashew nuts fried with lots of dried red chillies ,onion etc - Just amazing - the fried cashew nuts give an awesome taste with the chicken and the fried dried red chillies gives an amazing aroama and adds a superb flavour to the preparation 4.5/5

Mixed Hakka Noodles - fine - nothing extraordinary- I found it to be a tad oily - should have been taken care 3.5/5

Mixed Cantonese Noodles - Well prepared - Liked the over all taste - the Cantonese style was evident 3.5/5

Mixed Fried Rice- Nice - good amount of chicken , prawn- tasted good 3.5/5

Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce - Again Super stuff - The teriyaki sauce tasted superb - the chicken balls was soft and tasted great with the gravy 4/5

Slicec Fish in White Sauce - This preparation was the star of the dinner - bhetki slices in thick white sauce - the fish was freash soft and superb - the white sauce tasted really amazaing and the combo struck the right note 4.5/5

Overall - Great side dishes - Superb experience 4/5

If your are looking for some good chinese restro around golpark !!
You can surely visit here and you won't be dissapointed !!
I have visited kimli alot of times !!
Food is nice i have tried 30% of the dishes on the menu and it's good !!
Sometimes you may have to wait for your number as it gets crowdy during the evening !!
Service is fine !!
Probably not a place to visit with whole bunch of friends who like to talk loudly and have fun !!

Visited this place one evening with dad for dinner. 
The ambience was good. 
We had ordered one starter i.e Chilli Garlic Chicken. 
Our main course consisted of Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. 
The starter wasn't that good. A put off to be true. Our hopes had gone ground bottom. We believe that either the sauces mixture was not correct or that they had over cooked the dish
But then the main course was amazing. One of the best fried rice preparation and they had ample quantities of it. 
Do try it out and write your comments down below. 
Happy dining.

Want good food? Good chinese food? Like for a proper lunch or dinner? But have a big hole in your pocket? (like most of the time I have). Well well foodies....rejoice! Kimli is your answer! The decor is decent with well mannered staff and amazing food and good value for money. Order the rice or noodles....both are tremendously good... and the chicken, prawn, duck , all are very nice.¬†
so, happy hogging!

Good food and a budget place. It's quite an old place actually and they have renovated and expanded it. Their Special Green Rice and Duck Teriyaki used to be highlights. A little slow in service sometimes and food can be on the oily side - these are the only two negatives I could think of. Reliable place for good Chinese food especially if you don't want to pay through your nose. An old favourite. :)

One place where I have been to innumerable times, mostly with my mother after shopping sessions at Gariahat. Kimli is one of the old Chinese places where the food is decently good and priced moderately. Their portion sizes are pretty big and service is quick on most days. 
Nowadays, their number of customers may have dwindled but a sizeable group of loyal patrons remain. And it's also thronged by student groups for their pocket friendly prices, and big portion sizes.

After viewing quite good reviews from the foodies of Kolkata, we decided to give this place a try.

In short, Kimli serves spicy Chinese food (a lot spicy for us) in huge quantity at pocket friendly prices.

Interior is okayish. The only thing that may grab your attention is the wall hangings.

We ordered special green rice and sweet and sour schezwan style chicken. The quality of the rice wasn't that good, though it was stuffed with lots of veggies, chicken and prawn. The rice wasn't fluffy as fresh rice should be. Moreover it was too spicy to our palette. The Chicken dish was good; tender chunks of chicken cooked in sweet and sour gravy. However, both the dishes were very ordinary and lacked the Wow factor. Though brownie points should be awarded to kimli for their huge quantity and cost effectiveness. Hence this place is very popular among students.
Service is quite slow

This place is one of my favourites in the city...I come here very often but never get bored with the food they serve.Quality & Quantity of the food is very good...this combination is hard to crack by any restaurant and sometimes even the best in the town fail to do so. The best chinese at such pocket friendly prices..!!! Loved it totally..!!!¬†

PS--> The Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Lollypop is a must try here.

Located at the heartthrob of the city- Golpark. The ambiance is good. But the waiters are lacking in their courteous behavior. Coming to food, we ordered chilly Duck, that's the only dish which met our expectation. Quantity was huge. But the chicken dish had a stinky smell. Overall, doesn't have the courage to go second time. But, it gives you what you pay for. Really a small pocket pinch if compared with other similar restraus!

I have been there twice. After the first visit I gave 4 stars on zomato. Went there recently. I am still in shock as I write this review because words can't tell how disappointed I am in the establishment. Firstly many of the lamb items were not available. Finally settled for shredded lamb as advised by the waiter because we did not want to eat spicy food. Had to gulp down 2 glasses of soft drinks each with the said item. The chicken items and noodles were OK. Ordered duck but was aghast to find red coloured corn flour stuffed inside duck bone and also smothered liberally on top to give a sense of fullness without any duck meat. The dish was totally inedible. It was rather embarrassing as I was the one who had bragged and guided the entourage to this eatery. Note to self: Never to brag or be ecstatic about a food joint after one visit.

I hardly do get into writing reviews , and if at all, then it should be understood that the feathers have been ruffled, rather badly.Had gone there based on a friends recommendation but the experience was horrendous. Ordered Tom yum soup and chilly duck. The waiter repeatedly insisted to go with the duck,claiming it was as fresh as a daisy.The soup was O.K to say the least with dry and shredded chicken pieces swimming in laces of egg white. 40 minutes down the line, the duck appeared (resembled¬† black soot covered pieces of charcoal). It was hard, dry, deeply fried and had yellow bits of god knows what! To make this review worse, the waiters chatted away to glory and turned a deaf ear to request for water for the umpteenth time.This place certainly does not deserve a second visit. Some brave souls might think otherwise.

This is one of the most authentic places for Chinese in Southern Avenue and that's saying something given the inexhaustible options one finds in this part of Kolkata. Kimli is a delightful little restaurant situated in the locality of Hindustan Park, very near to the Gariahat flyover. You might need to use Google Maps, though.¬†

The menu at Kimli is filled with myriad delicacies of Chinese cuisine. So much so that at first glance, anyone would be perplexed as to what to order. I went there in a group of ten people. Being in such a huge group easily facilitates distinct orders and honestly, what more does a foodie wants. We ordered Chicken Chop Suey, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Pepper Garlic Lollipop, Hunan and Chilli Chicken. In one word, the food was magnificent. From the noodles to Chop Suey, everything was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy.¬†

The interiors of Kimli deserve a special mention. The place is not too large but it is very well decorated. You get the feeling that you are actually sitting inside someone's home and savouring all the astounding food. Service and price are moderate and this is the perfect place to throw budgeted parties for large groups. Deserves multiple visits.

Been here once. Was an old school friend's birthday treat. I got to dig into some amazing foods especially loving their fried rice, noodles and two lamb dishes. Quite lipsmacking. Tried their duck too (first time I have had duck) and frankly didn't enjoy it that much. Nevertheless was quite a good gastronomical experience.

This restaurant is pretty pocket friendly and serves good food. The location is not tough at all as it stands tall in one of the several alleys originating from golpark. One thing you are sure to notice is the huge difference in the ambience of the road outside the alley and that of the alley as it stays almost numb most of the time. It seems as if you suddenly enter a different place altogether. This was my 2nd visit,my 1st visit being not so pleasant, I found the place has improved a lot. A big thanks to the renovation they have done. It is very spacious now with adequate ventilation(something I felt missing the last time I visited this place). I ordered red pepper chilli garlic lollypop,special green fried rice,szechuan fried rice,mixed fried rice,hunan chicken and lamb tossed in oyster sauce. The quantity of the each item is very appreciable. The special green fried rice was the best item I had today. The lollypop had enough meat and had a unique taste which I immensely liked. The excess of chilli made it all the more yummy for me. All the 3 types of rices were very good with special green being the best closely followed by the mixed and the szechuan. The hunan chicken was the only thing that was not upto the mark. We were suggested hunan chicken when we asked the waiters for some spicy chicken dish. This was not spicy at all. I would recommend people not to listen to or ask the waiter for suggestions. The lamb was excellent as it gave a smoked feeling after gulping down every piece of it. It is a good place and I would like to visit it again.

One of those Chinese restaurant which I can put in my comfortable food joint list . I used to go there with my mom when I was a school kid . Today I took my parents to this place after many years . it's their first visit after the renovation . The people here are always warm and helpful and the food is really great with happy price tags . Honestly this combination is rare . 
Today,we ordered Corean Fried Rice , Shredded Lamb , and Teriyaki Fish . Lamb was tender and yummy but little salty . but the fish and fried rice were tasty and perfectly cooked just like old days . 
In brief, it's a good choice if you want some good Chinese without a turmoil in your pocket . it's a must try!

Situated on Purana Das Road near Golpark, this Chinese restaurant has a loyal following. The restaurant is small but picturesque. Dimly lit, this place has a quaint vibe to it.

The restaurant focuses on Chinese cuisine and sea food but offers some Indian dishes as well. There are some hits and misses with the food, but mostly they taste good. Quantity wise this place is impressive. You get great value for money on the basis of sheer quantity if not for anything else.

My most recent visit was a few hours ago with a few college buddies. We ordered Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Lollypop, special green fried rice, Szechuan fried rice, mixed fried rice, Hunan chicken and Lamb cooked in Oyster sauce. For me, the Lamb stole the show.

As ardent worshipers of the Chinese cuisine, it becomes necessary on one's part to visit Kimli at least once.

My personal favorites are the Chicken Sweet corn soup, The red pepper chilli garlic chicken, the schezwan rice and the Cantonese fish. The fish is fresh, the chicken is juicy and the batters crispy. What more can a lover of the Chinese cuisine ask for? 

The pricing is moderate, absolutely at par with the quality of food produced. Kimli is highly recommended.

Kimli is in my bucket from last 3 months after hearing lot of good reviews from my foodie friends I wanted to try them but never had a time to go there. So finally yesterday I ordered home delivery.

‚óèLocation‚óè
KIMLI is located very near yo the Muralidhar Girls college near golpark.

‚óèAmbiance‚óè
As I said that I ordered online so I cannot say about their ambiance and restaurant decoration.

‚óèFood Quality and Taste‚óè
Ordered for dinner so I tried below item:

Green Spcl Fried Rice: Absolutely gorgeous, properly cooked, enormous quantity, sufficient for 2 and 1/2 peoples. There was lots of veggies, chunks of chicken and prawn in it.

Egg Chicken Fried Rice: Another huge quantity of rice, great taste, smell was yummmy.

Cantonese Noodles: This was a chicken Gravy noodle with average tastes consisting huge quantity. 

Garlic Chicken Hakka Noodles: Excellent tastes, mild garlic flavour. Proper balance.

Teriyaki Chicken: It was good, 8 big pcs of chicken in black gravy..

Hunan Chicken: It was very spicy in red gravy. Also 8pcs of chicken. Tasted fine.

‚óèService/Packaging‚óè
Received the food with 53 mins of ordering. All box and containers has written the item name from them. Its quite good because You dont have to find the item throughout opening all the boxes.

Great experience.

Kimli is one of my favourite Chinese restaurant.. If you are on budget, or have to give treat to many people then kimli can very well serve our purpose.. 
Talking about the ambience-its not that fancy,,yet very decent.. 
Food quality is also on the standard side.. quite good.I generally have some common chinese dishes there like fried rice,mei foon,soups etc but the two best item that drag me towards kimli are - Red Pepper chilli garlic lollypop & schezwan chicken .‚ò∫üçóüçú

Situated near gariahat, this place attracts many. Vegetable hot & sour soup was excellent and rich. Crispy chilli babycorn was tasty, but the quantity was less and had too many green chills on it. For the main course we ordered stuffed mushrooms in manchurian sauce and vegetable special rich, which was good at quantity and tasted nice. Overall experience was great and yes I will visit this place again for their Chinese food.

It's a small piece of china town smack in the middle of Gariahat. A quaint little place with simple decor ,good service and great food. We had ordered chilli lamb which consisted of juicy pieces of shredded lamb with oodles of chillies and onion and just the right amount of soy sauce. Next came the chicken hot and sour soup,green rice and chicken in black bean sauce. The soup was surprisingly well balanced with big chunks of chicken and lots of veggies. The quantity of rice was too much even for the three of us to finish. The chicken was also good but nothing mentionable. The total bill was 727/- for the three of us, proving to be very pocket-friendly. The only downside was that the duck(which is their specialty by the way) was unavailable. However, it is certainly a place to be checked out, especially if your on a tight budget.

This place is in the golpark area. On the left lane while going towards gariahat. Near to sarson 360. I often visit this place. A nice family restaurant. Food is really good here. The pan fried fish is a delicacy, the hakka noddles, the chilli babycorn, the chicken sides are my personal favourites. The ambience is decent. The service is good. Only last time, (i guess there was shortage of service personnel) i found the service very slow and not upto the mark. This restaurant is a place worth visiting.

Kimli turned out to be a disappointment. I went to this place seeing the ratings in Zomato, but i didn't any resemblance with its rating. The place is not very big but its not small too. The place has a decent space with good furniture. The walls are decorated with paintings. The ceiling, doors and windows gives you a vintage feel. I felt the place was too dark with lack of proper lighting. The staffs didn't have a smile on their face and didn't even greet once. The service was slow and it took lot of time to bring what we ordered. Coming on to the main part i.e. the food. We took these things:

**Chicken Fried Rice: The Chicken Fried Rice was not bad. It was very ordinary. The preparation did not have anything special in it or anything which can make me wow.

**Chicken Noodles: The noodles was good but not great. It was little oily though. But it was eatable.

**Duck in Black Bean Sauce: Absolute disappointment. We expected a lot and got just the opposite. It was only bone, and no flesh in it. Even the gravy was not good. They did not even mention this in the menu. When we complained this to the manager, he was least bothered about it.

How to locate?
Walking distance from Golpark. Follow your zomato map it will be easy.

Last Words:
I can understand that few dishes may not be good but when the behaviour and service is not good its worthless to go to that place. Not recommended at all.

2/5 for my disappointment.

Kimli is one of those places where you can expect all around great stuff in all aspects. There really aren't many things which can present you with any chance to complain or give the proverbial "face scrunch". I am really gonna commend the interior deco and ambience, the dim lighting reflecting off of those red walls adorned with chinese deco really gives you a feel of a traditional chinese restaurant. The waiters are polite, helpful and service is prompt. Now coming to the main part and the biggest concern for all foodies: the food. The flavours are pretty spot on and some of the dishes are pretty much lovely, i would really recommend the "Red pepper Chilli Garlic Lollypop". It's one of the best dishes you can have here. The quantity served is pretty good, actually more than enough for 2 people (N.B: don't take someone who hates leaving even a drop of food remaining on the plate after the meal. I guarantee you'll regret it with the quantity they serve you) per plate. And lastly, though the place may appear slightly expensive, i'm gonna clearly point out that it is really good value for money. Definitely looking forward to visiting again.

Firstly, apologies for no pics. When you land in a place like Kimli in an extremely humid afternoon weather, you can't help but just eat.

I loved this place on my first visit. Once again, Kolkata can boast of great Indian Chinese-something which is missing to a great extent in other cities of India.

Both quality and quantity were fabulous and extremely satisfying. This is one of the only places in Kolkata which serves duck at such reasonable prices. So this tempted us to order the following:

Special Teriyaki Duck- Big pieces of duck flesh in a thick, dark, non-spicy gravy which is a bit sticky but nevertheless, goes extremely well with both rice and noodles. Less bones and more flesh makes your day. Certainly, this dish would make Kimli one of the best in Kolkata.

Lamb in oyster sauce- Another dish cooked to perfection. Oyster sauce well done and lamb meat cooked to the right amount, did not feel too fibrous. Big slices of lamb meat were offered by Kimli.

Mixed fried rice- Well boiled and appropriately cooked fried rice with pretty tangible pieces of meat and egg.

As mentioned previously, quantity was more than worth the price. Everything tasted great. It was a wholesome lunch and a lovely experience. Here's hoping to visit Kimli again and come back with a lot of pictures this time.

This is one of my favourite Chinese Restaurants. All the foods available are really tasty and authentic Chinese. The best thing about this place is their quick serving. They serve three dishes in 10 mins. This place was unbelievably cheap till few days back but recently they have hiked their prices. Although its not an issue as the quantity is so good.
Note: Order one dish per two person! Its more than enough!
Try Lamb items! Delicious is a small word to describe the taste!
Go once you will become a fan.
The waiters sometimes behave a little rude other nothing negative to say.

The place is a bit tough to find out if you don't know the surrounding area properly. The restaurant is nice. I got some good reviews about the ducks they server but I'm very unsatisfied with the duck server to us.

Firstly, apologies for no pics. When you land in a place like Kimli in an extremely humid afternoon weather, you can't help but just eat.

I loved this place on my first visit. Once again, Kolkata can boast of great Indian Chinese-something which is missing to a great extent in other cities of India.

Both quality and quantity were fabulous and extremely satisfying. This is one of the only places in Kolkata which serves duck at such reasonable prices. So this tempted us to order the following:

Special Teriyaki Duck- Big pieces of duck flesh in a thick, dark, non-spicy gravy which is a bit sticky but nevertheless, goes extremely well with both rice and noodles. Less bones and more flesh makes your day. Certainly, this dish would make Kimli one of the best in Kolkata.

Lamb in oyster sauce- Another dish cooked to perfection. Oyster sauce well done and lamb meat cooked to the right amount, did not feel too fibrous. Big slices of lamb meat were offered by Kimli.

Mixed fried rice- Well boiled and appropriately cooked fried rice with pretty tangible pieces of meat and egg.

As mentioned previously, quantity was more than worth the price. Everything tasted great. It was a wholesome lunch and a lovely experience. Here's hoping to visit Kimli again and come back with a lot of pictures this time.

This is one of my favourite Chinese Restaurants. All the foods available are really tasty and authentic Chinese. The best thing about this place is their quick serving. They serve three dishes in 10 mins. This place was unbelievably cheap till few days back but recently they have hiked their prices. Although its not an issue as the quantity is so good.
Note: Order one dish per two person! Its more than enough!
Try Lamb items! Delicious is a small word to describe the taste!
Go once you will become a fan.
The waiters sometimes behave a little rude other nothing negative to say.

[Intro]
If you love to eat chinese foods,want to have a cosy,then this is a must visit place.this is a first time visit to this place,cosy restaurant was a bit subtle,currying over chinese dishes.we enjoyed our leisurely afternoon in a bit chinese way.the place actually big enough spacious, around 30-35 people,walls decorated varities of wall hangings.
[Location]
Place located in purna das road.just very opposite to P.C.Chandra jewellers,walk straight from golpark walk towards gariahut,cross the Bedouin walk straight turn right.you will find this plsce.
[Ambience and interior]
First of all the initial reaction was that of a wow factor,the lights and the walls are utterly subtle and minimalistic with 6-10 paintings hanging.welcomed by the restaurant stuffs, the ambience was very average with dim lights.interior was just very average.
[Foods]
Introductory menu was not just out of the box,in brief featured in great chinese collection and delicacies.yet it takes us much effort to choose from a huge menu,
1. Chicken steamed wantons - very common chinese dish,mashed chicken covered by the wantons steamed well,the raw flavour totally gone, it was steamed very well and take out at right time.comes in 9 portions in a plate covered with herbs over it,quality and quantity good as well as tasty.
2. Chicken chilli garlic chowmin - well the noodles were very soft,boiled very well,the tossing part was very good the flavour was very tempting, during eating time the flavour filled the mouth.portion was good enough for two people.
3. Honey chicken - this was fantastic,chickens coated with honey,cooked very well added ginger and the garlic taste was very different, served very hot the coated with honey must try dish.
[Service]
They served the food very quickly,stuffs were very attaintative,the noodles they served it was good quantity and can be easily eaten by two people.the second item was the chicken steamed wantons,the soup with the wantons.served in a plate with a little but of herbs on the top.the third honey chicken it was superb sweet not so tender and no spice at all,it was good,and that much of appetizing and tasty.they serve a good quantity of food.the waiter takes much time to bring the food.food quality is sightly dipped the quantity is highly appreciable,prices are affordable.overall all very good experience.
I would like to visit this joint again,they have some other good dishes too.wish you all the very best everyone.

This has been a daily place for dinner for me now. As I am very much fond of chinese food so it is the good option for me to dine in here. I never get the same taste of Crispy Konjee Lamb which I have here. Also, I have tried out a lot of dishes and I must say most of them are delicious. Another thing to be mentioned is that it has a good ambience.

Situated near Gariahat, it's one of the numerous Chinese restaurants in that area with a good ambience and affordable pricing of food. The food quality is quite upto the mark and the quantity is quite generous as well. I and my friend had ordered a noodles, a fried rice and a side dish of chicken and we found it difficult to finish, even though we are both foodies and can eat quite an amount. 
The restaurant seemed to be quite popular and it might be a bit difficult to find a place during the busy hours. 

P. S. They don't add service tax to your bill, only VAT of 14.5%.

A restaurant located in a lane in Purna Das Road, Kimli serve more or less fair food, with ordinary service. As a whole the restaurant is just that. Ordinary. If you are looking at a pocket friendly option to treat your friends then this is definitely the place.
The food we ordered was the the chicken lollipop. It was absolutely plain and non spicy. The mixed rice was well prepared and was the best item. The mixed noodles was again well prepared. However the hot garlic chicken was sweet rendering the whole purpose of ordering it pointless. It was a bland meal, however it somehow managed to be satisfying. 
This restaurant therefore though sufficient fails to wow and has large room for improvement.

My 2nd visit at this place after about a couple of years. I remember this place being reasonable and the food being really good. But to my disappointment the quality fallen drastically. We ordered shredded lamb, Manchurian fish and veg hakka noodles. The service was quiick. The shredded lamb was quite good, but the noodles and Manchurian fish was disastrous. The fish was way too salty and had no redeeming quality and the noodles were very crispy, had almost no moisture in it and there was too much oil at the bottom of the serving dish.
Utterly disappointed.

Visited this place today after 2 years and it disappointed me big time. Service, ambience everything was good but food wasn't up to the mark. Shredded lamb was delicious but veg hakka noodles was very oily and wasn't boiled properly. Manchurian fish had excessive salt which killed the taste. They have increased the price also and i must say i have tasted far better food in this price.

It's a lovely quaint place with a warm inviting feel. Have visited this place innumerable times with friends and family. I recommend the garlic chicken with green pepper as a starter and all the soups are delicious. Duck with teriyaki sauce  and shredded lamb are my favorite dishes. I do think that the fried rice preparations could be better. They often have a burnt after taste. However, the proteins are exceptionally well cooked.

Location- Take the first left from Golpark towards Gariahat,a and take another left. The restaurant is easy to find, and is near Sarson 360. Kimli is quite big, and is also good for large groups. Had ordered Mixed Fried Rice, American Chopsuey, Thai Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken. The prices are very reasonable, and the quantity is huge. One dish is sufficient for two persons. Loved the Thai Chicken, it was the right amount of spicy. Overall good food, huge quantity, quick service. Nothing to complain about!

P.S They are pretty famous for their duck dishes.

Kimli used to be a quaint and cozy place for eating out . It has upgraded to a more spacious place but at the cost ¬†of ¬† quality of food, ¬†unfriendly attitude and ambiance. I have eaten here many a times when it was ¬†a small but quality eating place. ¬†Before ordering make sure that the waiter understands your specifications. Also try not to order anything with prawn.¬†
The prawn served is usually not fresh. Last time (on April 3rd) we told them to change our dish of garlic prawn, but they seemed to have just returned the same dish, because whatever they gave felt the same. We did not dare t eat it.¬†
Today we gave them a benefit of doubt and went there ¬†for a quiet lunch and told them to serve Fish Teriyaki because the waiter promised us it would not be spicy. Despite his word, the dish they served was very spicy and we tasted it in front of the waiter and told him about the dish being spicy.¬†
he didn't even bother to say sorry, and simply took away the dish to come bacj 25 minutes later with fish in white sauce. We had to eat our noodles without any side dish because if we had waited for him, the noodles had turned cold.¬†
When we went to the manager sitting at the reception desk and told him about the attitude of the waiter, his attitude was even worse. He just looked at us as if to say ¬†" Why the hell do you come here? Take it or leave it. But don't complain.
We have decided never ever to go there again.

This place has grown a lot over the years. Initially when it opened, it was a tiny, gloomy restaurant tucked away in a peaceful locality near Golpark. After all the renovation they have ample space. The decor is more or less classic. The service is good. Coming to the food part, it is good. Quantity is quite filling and some of the items are extremely yummy. Gravy items had too much gravy when I visited last time. It is a good place to have a sumptuous dinner once in a while. Value for money. Go for it.

One of the best moderately costing Chinese restaurant... Let me straight go to the best part of the menu.. and yes none other dan the chimney soup is the show stopper. . People hop in for a smack of perfectly poached crab prawn and chicken and flavourful broth with tantalizes ones sense at such a light pocket. Dn comes the chicken clear soup that gives a pure bliss.. I must say if you are a soup lover and lukin for a pocket friendly menu for some lip smacking soup, it has to be ur kinda place.. main courses r also no doubt upto to the expectation. . Amount is very wholesome as compared to the rates.. a 'common man 'chinise lover's paradise.. ambience is not much posh or attractive but peaceful and hospitable.. overall a great place to be wid family and friends for a good tym and good Chinese. .@rajarshee ray @rahul @prativa

We left after an hour of waiting because it was too late...they took 10 minutes to produce the bill even! Highly disappointed.

Your go to place for a decent plate of Bengali Chinese. Expect anything more and you'd be grossly disappointed. Wholesome quantity , big on flavours and best for take out if tiny places are not your thing. Do try the chicken lollipop and the wantons. Good for a quick grub or to feed an army. Be warned though the man behind the cash counter can be terribly abrupt occasionally.

The gateway is decorated with tubs. Just beside the entrance, there are some show pieces which give a chinese feeling. On going inside, i found it was quite dark but the decoration was nice. Beautiful paintings, wall hangins and curtains gave an authentic feeling.

I'm never ordering from them again. I ordered teriyaki duck from them yesterday. Well, the quantity was alright but it wasn't teriyaki. It tasted more like chilli duck or the usual Chinese gravy that you get anywhere. The quality of the meat was terrible. It was too chewy, to say the least. What's worse is the aftereffects. I've been having stomach aches and loose motion ever since. Right now I'm on medicines and hope to never say Kimli again ever!
I can't comment about their other dishes but a big no to duck.

A typical situation for any South Kolkattan. Shopping in Gariahat for hours + acute starvation + search for a good and reasonable diner, and you end up at Kimli. The ambience is very casual and you feel relaxed from the moment you enter. The food, to say the least, is delicious. The quantity is huge considering the price. We ordered a Mixed fried rice, Chicken with Baby corn and Mushrooms and Garlic Chicken. The standout was the Fried rice. The rice was so fluffy and the taste lovely. I would recommend it to all looking for delicious food. Ting! :-)

If you're walking from gariahat to golpark along the right side of the street, this restaurant will be on one of your right lanes.
As with my other reviews, I don't review a place until and unless I've been there at least twice.
I visited kimli once during the pujas, and once recently.
I didn't quite like the food during the pujas. The rice noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird stench. The chili chicken was literally covered with two handful of chillies. Extremely spicy.
And now when I visited the restaurant a few days back,I didn't like the food that much.
The chilli lamb was extremely spicy. Only thing u get to taste is chilli and the heat. Schezuan rice was so so.
We have better options in the gariahat-golpark stretch. Dissapointed!

We had ordered their Special Green Fried Rice, Vegetable Fried Rice, Schezuan Chicken, Chilli Garlic Prawn and Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish (Dry) and that was so much food for all of us. Everything was perfectly made and is definitely must visit for people who want to enjoy quality Chinese food. Looking forward to visiting again.

I used to go to this place a while back, and going back yesterday, I was actually surprised! They've renovated and it's a bigger place now, well air-conditioned and cozy. The food is pretty standard Indian chinese, well flavoured and well cooked.¬†

Portion sizes are great, good enough for 2 to share. My favourites are the pepper chicken, spring chicken, chilli garlic noodles, lemon chicken. Just about anything is good here. Pretty affordable prices. They have a great array of seafood too, which includes crab and tiger prawns, at surprisingly low rates. Wide variety of options for everything on their menu.¬†

Easy to find, in a lane near the Golpark more, and easy on the pocket, happy in the tummy.

We ordered chicken meifoon, dry red pepper chilli garlic lollipop and chilli fish.. All the items were equally good and coming to the main point which is huge quantity. The lollipops were crispy fried and very spicy with loads of green chilli's. The meifoon was very fine and the fish was fresh.. Overall, a tasty Chinese experience...

I have heard about this place for quite a sometime now, so finally visited last week for lunch to experience. Located near Golpark beside Muralidhar Girl's college, opposite to P. C. Chandra Jewellers. When I entered, my first impression was Wow. I'm really very very impressed with the food and overall experience and would love to visit again. 

Decor : Very well decorated and moderate dining hall. Strategically places beautiful paintings and Chinese show pieces. Lighting was perfect, not too bright, not to dark. The ceiling and the over painting and everything really caught my attention. 

Ambience : Very peaceful and perfect to have food with family, friends or partner. Not too loud or noisy. 

Service : Very well mannered staff and service was pretty good. 

Food : Quite good, I was really impressed to have such tasty Chinese dishes after a long time at this place. Quantity was more than sufficient, enough to be shared by 2. I ordered for Chicken Lollypop, Mixed Rice Noodles, Sweet and Sour Chicken and American Chopsuey. Mixed Noodles was full of chicken, egg and prawns and the Chopsuey was too good to taste. I was really happy to eat that authentic style Chopsuey after such a long time, I had Chopsuey at many places but not like Kimli. 5 star for that as well. 

Value for Money : Very reasonable for the quantity of food they serve, easily affordable by all and even college goers. 

A must recommend if you want to authentic Chinese food near Golpark area and not China Town in a much affordable price.

This place is located at Gariahat in the lane beside the Bombay Dyeing showroom.Food is alright..most of the items are decent without being too delecious. The soup served here is unique in terms of the sheer quantity served.A single portion can comfortable feed 2 adults. Quality wise also it is perhaps the best of the lot. Space is adequate to seat around 20 people..seats are relatively comfortable. However,the food quality leaves a lot to be desired.

This was my 1st visit......and man I totally fell in love...... The food, the quantity , the taste every thing .....
Location :- Find the restaurant is a serious difficulty....... If you are not a regular visitor of gariahat area ,the best way to find this restaurant is to take the lane by the side of Bedwin .......you¬† able to see kimli signboard.... Turn right (as the arrow directed) and u will find the entrance.....
Ambiance:-...well ..i can say its nothing much....just pretty ordinary....seating capacity is good...bt the problem is chairs are not that much comfortable
Food:- they have a huge variety of Chinese dishes..... even if u r vegetarian u can have sum good options..... We ordered Red pepper chili garlic lollypop , Spicy chicken , Chicken chow chow rice , Thai noodles....Red pepper chili garlic lollypop was really awesome...there was 10 pieces .....one of the best chicken lollypop i ever had......Spicy chicken is seriously spicy.....quite disappointed with Chicken chow chow rice.....Thai noodle was good.....gdd portion of veggis......Quantity of all plates are really huge....bt quality is good bt could be better...
¬†Service:- Service is damn qiuck....staffs are friendly ¬†
Overall its a really good experience......pocket pinch dont hurt you....hoping¬† for visit soon here....if u r short in pocket and hungry...Kimli is a good option....

The place is small but beautiful.. You will get a very good ambience here.. The Chinese served here is quite different from many other in the city.. There's a lot of option in Chinese dishes to pick from.. Only con which I could find was that the crab dishes were not upto the mark.. Leaving that aside its a good place to eat with pretty reasonable rates

Visited this place a few days back with my wife. Located between Gariahat and Golpark and beside new Sarson 360 joint. We found this with the help of Here Maps. It is a small restaurant with limited seating capacity. Anyway we have ordered for Mixed fried rice,shredded lamb and Duck Teriyaki for those they had taken more or less 15 minutes. Now regarding the Mixed  Fried rice was so so,not anything special. I didn't understand Duck Teriyaki,  to me it was more like meat üçñ pakoda submerged in typical Chinese gravy. May be I am not alover of Chinese cuisine. But shredded lamb was delicious üòã. All the dishes were quantity was enough for 2 persons.

If it's Chinese food at reasonable prices then this place is the best place to go to. This is a place that my best friend and I always visit when we are short on cash. But the food is so good especially the golden chicken that they serve. We always order two bowls of chicken fried rice and a plate of chicken as a side and the food is so good that we finish everything on our plate. A must visit place. Ambience is really good along and the staff is friendly.

Located in the bylanes of Golpark, this place is a real gem. Once you walk through the doors you might not be impressed by the ambience. Ambience is pretty average....but the quality of food is exceptional. The service too is up to the mark. We ordered Red pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken Lollipop. This dish defined what "HOT" is....extremely tasty....it reduced us to tears by the end. You must order this if you plan to visit this place. Other than this we ordered Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles, Mixed Schezwan Rice and Chilli Garlic Chicken as side dish. All I can say that they delivered beyond my expectations. Simply mouth watering stuff. I am sure gonna visit in the near future to try out the other dishes. Prices are pretty reasonable too. A must visit place in South Kolkata.

Ok.... Heard a loooooooot about this Chinese gem in Kolkata.... But, in Kolkata most people prefer a typical type of Chinese food, which you can't even get in China I believe.... This restaurant is not an exception.... Now pros and cons....
Nice ambience, more than sufficient quantity (we ordered only one rice for us and it was plentiful for both of us), reasonable price....
Now cons, the quality and taste of food could have been better, don't get me wrong, it's not bad at all and it's really a personal opinion, but the quantity of sugar they added in Garlic Lamb drastically decreased the taste and also my appetite....
If you are a true Chinese food lover (which I'm not), you should definitely try their food....
Update....
Visited this place again yesterday, tried different items but sadly the quality of the food was not up to the mark.... Surprisingly all the items more or less tasted alike.... Will try to avoid the place....

This is a small restaurant near Golpark. The ambience is not that attractive. But who cares about the ambience when the food quality is excellent. They serve good quantity in a very pocket friendly price.It is¬†our family's all time favourite food joint. And whenever we go, we make sure these three items are there on our table:1) Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Lollypop : This chicken starter is so high on demand that sometimes it is not available during evening time.2) Special Green Noodles 3) Mandarin FishThis restaurant is highly recommended for Chinese food lovers.

Have been visiting this place since my school days. Full marks for their amaaaaaaaaaaazing food! For me Chinese = Kimli! The quantity and quality of food served here at such low cost is unbelievable. It's been a year that this joint has shifted place, though the earlier one was cosy and a bit congested, this new one is spacious and well lit. The interior is also done up in a favourable manner. The staffs know me by now, as I frequently visit this place, and they are friendly and helpful. Today we ordered - 1) Red pepper chilli garlic chicken lollipop : 10 pieces of spicy chicken lollipops which will be a delight to your taste buds. 2) 2 plates of Manchurian rice : yum yum super yum. 3) Chicken in hot garlic sauce :s tasted divine. Simply finger licking good. 4) Spicy fish : tangy and tasty. Both the chicken and the fish items contained 8 pieces. All this for just a mere 840 bucks. Super love! Coming back again and again. With

To day we were low on budget but high on hope ,so whats our pick? Yes its none other than kimli....
This restaurant isn't a easy to find restaurant... If you are not a regular visitor of gariahat area....the best way to find this restaurant is to take the lane bi the side of bedwin golpark.you can be able to see kimli signboard.... Turn right ..its the entrance....old Chinese restaurant type felling comes when you enter the restaurant....seating arrangement are good...dim lighting can be a problem for photography but its not at all a headache....
Now come to food...as we were low on budget ...we don't have the option for ordering a starter... That was a great miss... We ordered mixed fried rice with chicken munchurian....mixed fried rice is so good with ample chicken egg and prawns and yes the quantity they serve is huge..... And also tastes very well...
About the Manchurian yes it is also very good with soft tender chicken pieces ,which was also in good quantity and quality...
The bill ...only 303 inr.....
But the main thing is there was no place left in our stomach for the starters ... 3 cheers for kimli

I visited this place once and I must say they serve some fine platters. Chilli pork is something that should taste. Schezwan dishes of chicken is quite good as they actually tastes like Schezwan and not just an item with loads of dry red chilli in it.

The price is quite reasonable and not a pinch to your pocket. 4 people can eat a full course meal within Rs. 1,200/- at the comfort of an air conditioned restaurant. The uantity isto price ratio is quite high e.g. a platter of Hakka noodle is sufficient for 2 person unless you have skipped meals to gulp down the entire bowl.

The location makes this invisible to people and makes it a place with selective guests. At a stone's throw distance from Golpark petrol pump and RKM Library this place should be visited by all who love decent Chinese food within a small budget.

We just discovered this place while walking around this area. When we entered we were unsure about the quality and taste of food. 

We went for a drums of heaven. To our surprise they served 10 pieces in 150 bucks. I must say they were very good. We gained a little faith over this place and ordered another starter , pepper chicken. This is where they completely disappointed us . they presented us with tiny chicken pakora like dish. We didn't  really have any expectations after that so we left. The second one was VERY disappointing.

Happy eating :)

I came with a friend here during the afternoon.  The ambience seems to be average with dim lights and not so welcoming. The service was not that good. Waiter took around 15 mins just to bring a glass of water. We ordered a crispy chilly garlic babycorn,  veg hakka chowmein and manchurian. Except for the chowmein the other items had excess of salt and tasted average. Place needs a lot of improvement in services and interiors.

But my favourite dishes are Mixed Cantonese, Garlic Chicken, Chicken in spicy red sauce. Their Tiger prawns are delicious as well. Their American Chopsuey are worth mentioning. I love their chilli duck as well. Basically I like more or less everything here. Service is quick and staff is very well behaved.
I always had a lovely experience here.

One of my favourite chinese restaurants of all time. My best friend led me to it one day when we were out on a book-buying spree and I've been going there everytime I've had a pocket friendly chinese craving. The restaurant has shifted from where it originally was to a few inches away but somehow I liked the first place much better. The must try dishes on the menu are the meifoon (rice noodles), the gravy chilli garlic chicken and the dry chilli chicken. 90% of the times I've been here, this is what I've had and there has been absolutely no change in the quality and quantity of the food, thankfully. The prices are just right and service is quick. I do wish they would deliver, though. Other than that, great place! Love it!

Another Chinese cuisine place. Kolkata is filled with Chinese cuisine places, thanks to the never ending love for Chinese among the Bongs.  This place is worth a visit, for the only reason that, it is located at a prime place.  Food is very normal, nothing out of this world.  The most amusing part for me was the Chinese calendar and Chinese horoscope table mats.  Rest ambience is not so good nor is the seating.  Might suggest for a friendly hangout.

This is a familiar old Chinese restaurant I've been visiting since childhood.. cosy little place serving delicious food at quite a cheap price..¬†
Gave it a visit after a long time and found everything at its place.. old faces, old laughing Buddha statues, old menu with a little renovation of the place here and there..¬†
ordered a chicken chilli garlic chowmein and a schezwan (szechuen) fish which i knew was enough to feed two hungry souls as the quantity is quite generous..
it took them around 15 minutes to serve the food and it took us the exact same time to polish off our plates and the serving bowls as well.. Yes, we were Very Hungry! :p¬†
the ¬†szechuen fish was well cooked. the bhetki fish seemed to be fresh and devoid of any fishy smell which is many a times found in fish preparations of other restaurants.. the dish was spiced up with whole red chillies, exactly how it should be!¬†
the chicken chilli garlic chowmein was cooked well, tasted fair, though i thought it could have been prepared better. couldn't really find out the chillies and garlic which were meant to be present! a bit disappointed on this one!

so, to sum up:
good ambience
good service
helpful staff (the waiter helped us well to pair up the appropriate dishes)
good food
generous quantity
real happy prices!

a big thumbs up to the management!
keep up the good job guys and aim for betterment!

I have been to place number of time and a review is due for a quite a long time now. Ambience of the place is okay and d√©cor is not something which is their strong point. I had tried many dishes over the time but recently I had vegetable fried rice, teriyaki duck and chili garlic crab claws. Rice was overcooked and I didn't enjoyed much. And crab also was not that good.also I felt the crab was a bit costly. But the duck was simply knockout! The flavours of the gravy and the meat was superb. The meat was on the bone and it was delicious.portion was good. You can also try their coriander fish and red pepper chili garlic chicken.

I simply love the Indianised Chinese cuisine served here. The vegetable Manchurian is a must try! Vegetable Hakka noodles was also palatable. The service is quick but since this place is a little petite, you may have to wait outside during peak hours. But the tasty food served here is just worth the wait. Besides, they have tried to give this place the Chinese restaurant ambience which is really cute with the little chandeliers and pictures of Chinese monuments.its a cool and cute place to catch up with your friends or treat them on any occasion. üòä

This humble joint is located in a lane in the gariahat-golpark area(the same lane where pc Chandra and chandrani pearls have their outlets). We dropped by in a pretty famished state and whatever we ate tasted good. Well you definitely do not expect or get an impecaable d√©cor with jazz palying in the backdrop  or suave waiters attending you here but you will definitely get some generous helpings of delicious food at an incredibly good price. Service is damn prompt. To sum it up Kimli is not a fine dining kind of a place but definitely the ‚Äúpaisa wasool‚Äô type where you can just hop in unplanned with friends or family and eat rather than ‚Äòdine-out‚Äô. ÔÅä

Usually for Vegetarians like me Chinese food falls short of options...however this one place I would go back again & again not only for options, but for the taste & the quantity they offer.

The ingredients are of good quality & they must be using good quality fresh cooking oil every time, as I didn't find any discomfort post lunch/dinner, even if I am overfed at times !

For non-Vegetarians, Golden Prawn Fry is a must try in starters. 

For Vegetarians, Sweet Corn Thick Soup followed by Chilli Potato in semi-gravy form with Hakka Noddles can be a safe try always. 

However, I found their meifoon / rice-noodles preparation not so tasty, rather it was quite bland.

Decor, lighting & ambience-wise it is one of those places where you want to come back again 'n again, occupy your table & just order your "proprietary" dishes...be it a summertime afternoon, a nagging drizzly monsoon evening or a chilly winter night !

Tucked away in a corner of Golpark, Purnadas road Kimli used to be quite a favourite cheap chinese eating joint since schooldays.Went there last weekend after so many years ..things have changed ..ambience.. well pretty nice ..smart decor ,false ceiling ,more spacious now that they have moved to be neighbouring building .Staffs are not courteous enough nowadays ..one major difference ..not eager to listen ,understand and cooperate while taking orders and serving .Ordered garlic chicken for main course ,got sweet n sour chicken instead. For takeaway ordered chilli fish dry ,got garlic fish instead .Wonder what went wrong that day and it was not even that much crowded ...Food is OK and the pocket pinch is less . Not a good experience from a place that used to be so good .

My friend came up with the suggestion of visiting this restaurant and I happily agreed to accompany her to try something new. We had to wait for a minute before entering. Spacious place. Not something out of the ordinary. Service was good. A waiter promptly appeared to take the orders. Fried chicken Wantons. Special green hakka chow. Szechuen fried rice. Hot garlic lamb. Food arrived after 10-15 minutes. All the items were decent. Quantity good enough for two persons. Cost us seven hundred rupees. Will I go there again? Only if I'm hungry and nearby.

This was the 1st time I visited Kimli.... I went there wid my friends...We ordered chilli garlic chowmein........ And it was really good.... Moreover something Kimli is known for is the quantity of food....one plate of chowmein is enough for two... Price was also reasonable... Surely this is a place i would like to visit again

Kimli is simply GREAT.

Order anything that's listed on the menu, they'll get it for you. They're pretty fast and have absolutely pocket friendly rates. 
Kimli never disappoints.

I went there thz Puja and believe me I didn't expected it to be that good . during pujas every big or small restros have to deal with alot f customers which results to degradation in their food quality . but am happy with the fact that they managed to keep up their good work. Am not pleased with their ambiance but nevermind after waiting for so long that day I got good food.

The Chinese here is one of the best in south calcutta. The pricing of the items r affordable and the quantity is satisfactory. The taste is up to the mark. We ordered chicken fried rice chow chilli chicken and chicken Manchurian. All of them were good no complaints from my side. The service could be better though.

Went there a couple of days back after a long time and I have to say the quality of food has gone down a few notches. The duck was undercooked, lamb was too salty and rice was bland to say the least. Only positive would be that their quantity has remained consistent over time. All in all, disappointed..

The quality of food and taste is very yum.. Great Chinese... Also I would say the quantity is quite a lot . impossible for one person to finish a whole portion of rice or noodles.. Special mention to the pricing which is very reasonable and one of the best ..

Visited this restaurant on Shashthhi afternoon and was inevitably asked to wait in line, which was quite understandable given the popularity of this restaurant. 
We ordered an egg meifoon, prawn fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.
It was simply cooked, wholesome 'Indian Chinese' fare, but the meifoon noodles were sticking to each other and the rice grains could have been finer, the chicken was quite good.
But, given the word-of-mouth publicity around this place, I am sure it was the pressure of feeding a plethora of guests which made them compromise a tad little bit on the quality, but the HUGE quantity made up for the loss.

Would surely recommend for a nice, cosy winter date... :)

This place is located close to golpark Ramakrishna mission institute , and is a few meters away from nava nalanda school higher secondary section and also from muralidhar girls college . The location is not very difficult to spot , and being removed from the bustle of the main road below the flyover , the restaurant remains quieter than other restaurants nearby during the pre Puja rush. The dishes served here are very interesting , and is a meat lover's dream ! You get everything from chicken to fish to prawn to lamb to duck to pork ! So the menu might leave you spoilt for choice at the time of ordering .  The shredded lamb is a dry lamb meat dish with an onion and garlic base , and is sweet and spicy. The duck teriyaki comprised sizeable pieces of duck meat suspended in a capsicum and onion gravy. Both taste yummy  , and the amount will force you to pack the remaining portion for home if you're  eating alone or are just two people . The dishes are best shared with at least 3 people! The mixed fried rice tasted good too . The interiors are dimly lit , giving the place a homely feel and atmosphere. The place is popular  with the young college crowd , as well as young professionals and couples. If you're here , don't miss the duck !

The food is nice though the noodles were not that well made. The chimney soup without the chimney was bland but otherwise nice. The rest of the food was very good and the personnel were also quite nice. However, the seating arrangement is just too cramped... And I won't fancy going there if this kind of horrible arrangement is continued. The seats are too small and the steel frame doesn't allow to use two of the small tools together. 
The food is very moderately priced and the taste is quite decent

We were searching for some place that serves duck at pocket friendly rates when zomato suggested Kimli. It was a bit difficult to locate, and might as well be difficult if you are from north kolkata and not that well versed with the streets in this area.
Suggestion: Get down at Golpark. Spot a wide lane to your left from north. Start walking until you find another lane to your left with the P.C. Chandra showroom and Kimli will be to the opposite of it.
Coming to the place- cozy, well lit with a somewhat different atmosphere. We ordered for special mei foon and duck teriyaki. The mei foon was bit on the oily side and the 'special' part was the added mushrooms which looked more like tiny bits of burnt onion- yes, they were that tiny AND negligible, but the other elements like the chicken pieces and prawns saved the dish. The quantity was good enough for two of us although you might want to order for another if you are really hungry. 
The duck teriyaki: the sauce was nice and thick with sesame seeds. It was really different from the usual chinese dishes. There were enough duck pieces, although some of them were just big pieces of bones with little flesh. The meat was overcooked making it really chewy in texture, not soft and juicy. We started doubting if it was really duck or something between fish and chicken.
Overall, Kimli is an average place to eat if you have a tight pocket. Would like it give it another try with lamb.

This was my first time here. It's a small restaurant known for its chinese delicacies. The food was too oily but tasted good. Typical indo chinese food served in handis. The shezwan fried rice was excessively spicy even though we asked for it to be made mild. Portions are generous. Had a quick lunch. Overall taste buds were satisfied.

We tasted duck teriyaki, crispy conji lamb, mixed rice and it was a nice experience. Hopefully kimli will provide all with the nice feeling that we had in there and I should add that there will be a lot more visits that I will make there.

But since it was puja time we had to wait for 1.5 hrs.There were many people visiting this popular restaurant.
We ordered Chicken Fried Rice

A simple menu.
Food arrived quickly.

A special mention about Edward and Mohan, their hospitality just fantastic. Try the tiger prawns totally worth it, garlic fish, green chilli chicken. Ask them to extra toss the fried rice, that tastes splendid. Totally recommend the place for budget friendly eat out

Me along with my Mom went to kimli expecting a nice weekend lunch but what we had was a horrible nd utterly disgusting experience. The waiter who was taking order from us was a guy with all kinds of shrewd mentality nd he didn't even know how to behave with a customer. We asked his suggestion for a particular food item nd he was like "ami jani na, apnar ja icche hoy korun". I mean what!!!!!! What kinda behavior is dis! We were highly disappointed nd disgusted as well. Then another staff served schezwan duck what we ordered as the starter. We ordered it because we had it earlier nd it was something to go gaga for..but sadly yesterday's preparation was just not edible. D flesh was extra hard nd chewy as well nd it tasted like last nIght's left overs :-/ . Then came our main course..a shredded lamb item with schezwan mixed fried rice..nd to our astonishment d rice was BURNT. I mean what the heck is this..! Which restaurant serves burnt foods to their customers??!! We were afraid of eating anything there after that horrible experience. The waiter was so ill mannered that at the time of taking orders from us he was repeatedly walking away without listening completely. He might get offended with us but this is just not the way to treat your customers. And all the time we were there he was behaving like he was doing us a favour. 
We were very fond of this restaurant but after yesterday's experience we threw it out from our eatery joints. Zomato doesn't allow to rate any restaurant with a ZERO but I think they deserve to get negative ratings.

We ordered Mixed Noodles and Malaysian Chicken. Both the dish were delicious and every taste was just right.¬†
The quantity is more than enough for one person.
Coming to the other aspects, service was very prompt and friendly. Surprisingly the price was reasonable compared to the quality and quantity of food they serve. The aroma is quite soothing. Overall this is no doubt a very nice place to enjoy a nice meal with friends of family.

Two visits to this place and I'm already wanting to go back again . The front balcony/waiting area is very welcoming and had a pretty shelf with Chinese decorative items. 
As you enter , the first thing that will hot you is the wok smell,  that used to be there is all good Chinese restaurant at one point of time. 
The place isn't very decorated but is neat and clean. The staff is prompt and the service is fast . 

Coming to the food. The Chimney soup is a show stealer. Beautiful full bodied broth. Lots of mushrooms and good amount of meat. A medium chimney soup is good enough for two people . They use tiny baby shrimps that add a stunning flavor to the soup. 

One must try the shredded lamb. Which is tender add still had a great meaty flavor. I added some to my soup and that added a whole new dimension to the soup. 

Do have the sweet caramelly honey chicken . A squeeze of lime is suggested as it enhances the flavor ten folds . 

Do also try the tereyaki duck . Another brilliant dish. .

Great food . Good service . Large portions. Value for money . Perfect formula for success !

There are only few restaurants which receives a 4.5/5 from me and Kimli is one of them which solemnly owned by them because of their wonderful service,priceand food quality.
Location- Located in Purna Das Road just next to the lane of Nava Nalanda High School this is a small place with 5-6 tables.
Food Quality and Quantity- I went to this place in sosthi of last year's Durga Puja. The restaurant was in full demand at that time. I had to wait for 30 mins and then got a table. The waiter gave us some time even in the busy rush.¬†
We ordered Mixed Gravy noodles,Chicken sweet and sour chicken, Schezwan crispy chicken.¬†
The gravy mixed noodles was awesome. Never tasted better.¬†
The Schezwan Crispy chicken with the gravy noodles was a perfect combination.
The best part is they provide 10 pieces of chicken which I have never found in any other restaurants.
Sweet and sour chicken was superb.
I strongly believe cheap price never goes with high quality. But this is the first place where I have found this opposite pole combination.¬†
A must visit of everyone.¬†
I strongly recommend all the items I have tried.¬†
Looking forward to visit this place soon and try more of their items.

Well, we had to go for this one someday. And it was finally after our initial placements. 
And it was a celebration to be remembered. 
So let me start with the ambiance. Yes, pretty standard for an upmarket Chinese joint. We had to wait for like 20 minutes to get in, but only because we were many in number and they had to join chairs to seat us. Now to the food.
The Duck here is just frickin amazing, no other word. Teriyaki and Ginger Duck were so awesome, and adding to that, the Lamb was pretty good too. Obviously, the noodles served as the perfect compliment to them. All in all, a very good meal.
Surprisingly, not a pocket pinch at all either. So if you're in and around Gariahat and looking for a quick bite of the Orient, drop in. You won't regret it.

There are more types of Chinese food available in Kolkata than there are provinces in China.

The Tangra type.........All the Tangra joints like Beijing,Kaffulok etc

The Park street type........Bar B Q,Waldorf.

The Esplanade type.......Chung wah,Embassy,

The Free School Street Type......How Hua

The Chinese owner driven old joints......Kim Ling on Lake terrace.

The 5 star type......Chinoisserie at the Taj

The Bengali Chinese......any place serving chowmein and chilli chicken North of Rash behari avenue.

A couple of legends like Song Hay,kim Wah have closed down.

Kimli belongs to the last kind.By Bengali Chinese I mean no disrespect.Because none of the types mentioned above are authentic Chinese.So with that frame of mind I entered the place after a long time,hungry and eager.

Ambience is nil,basic tables with wrought iron chairs,heavily air conditioned.

Asked for the safe Chicken fried rice and red sauce Bhetki fish.On being told that the Bhetki would be the Bombay Bhetki which is a huge seafish instead of the sweeter,smaller,river born Kolkata Bhetki,I retracted and went for the safer Chilli Chicken with gravy.

Both were safe plays,the chilli chicken perfect with lots of chillis but the fried rice had chicken pieces which were tough.Quantity was adequate and taste was excellent especially the Chilli Chicken.Service was brisk and energetic.

It was occupied by giggling students of the adjoining Girls college and serious Gariahat shoppers.And the price will warm you up.These eateries serve a vital function in the social fabric of the city and I love them.....inspite of the Bombay Bhetki.

Standard Chinese food with reasonable prices. Had Chic. button mushroom soup, veg. singapore Mei Foon and Lamb in Oyster sauce. Loved the lamb. The meat was tender and the flavor was appropriate. The rice noodles was a bit on the lower side. The crispy softness that you expect in Singapore rice noodles was missing. The meal was satisfying and filling nonetheless.¬†Recommended for an economic Chinese dine-in.

This was a place that had been recommended to me by many of my friends..
The dining area is quite small but exceptionally neat and tidy. Had a craving for duck so I ordered Duck Teriyaki along with Coriander Chicken.
The Teriyaki Duck was just what an average Bong taste buds demand: Tok-Jhal-Mishti...The duck meat was lean and bony but marinated very well. The garnish worked very well with the meat.
The Coriander Chicken went well with Duck. It was mildly spicy and bland with soft juicy chicken pieces. 
All first timers: Try the lamb and Crab and Singapore Noodles. The Konjee Crispy lamb is a delight.

This is a great Chinese joint in Golpark Gariahat locality. Kimli prepares amazingly good Chinese food. The price is also pretty reasonable. One must try the prawn preparations. 

They now have a much better and bigger restaurant. The service is decent. They do not serve alcohol. 

This is a must visit place to have a very good Chinese food lover in Kolkata.

One of the best pocket friendly Chinese restaurant in town. Located near gariahat more this is my place to go if I am craving chinese in that area. Must admit at first the ambiance and place was a little gloomy but after the renovation the place looks better than ever. My favorite is the duck teriyaki. You may also try their mix fried rice, ith chicken in chili sauce, lamb in oyster sauce. 

Overall Great place to eat. :)

Mixed feeling, I must admit first... They are well known and established one.. Small budget and Chinese (Indian) food.. There you go... Inside a bit claustrophobic and gloomy... We have tasted many items and those are up to OK mark and quantity wise it is more than adequate.. Its better if you take away..

Have been visiting this joint pretty regularly since coming back to Kolkata in 2012. So much so, that the Head Waiter, Mr. Edward now knows most of our favorite dishes and we hardly need the menu card to place our orders. The chicken steamed momo is so high in demand that most of the days it gets over by 8 in the evening and as such we've had the opportunity to have it only a couple of times because we usually turn up around 9:30 or so for dinner. The fried rice is splendidly subtle in taste and most of the dishes (both starters & mains) are awesome; our favorites being Prawn Teriyaki, Chicken in Green Chilli sauce, Fried Spring Chicken, Red Chilli Prawns (small shrimp dumplings with onion, red chilli and garlic). 
The best part is that their quality has remained unchanged over the last 3 years that we're visiting the place. Awesome experience every time we've visited this joint.

Went there to have dinner on a saturday night.I heard that this place is crowded most of the time and on weekend nights specially u have to wait for a few minutes to get a table.But to our surprise we got a table as soon as we arrived.It is not a huge restaurant with too much decorations or style but its a pocket friendly resturant with good,fresh and delicious chinese food.We were 2 people and we ordered a plate of mixed fried rice,mixed hakka chow,salt n pepper fish and teriyaki duck.All the items were served fresh and hot and were delicious with almost no complains and the final bill we had to pay was only Rs 687 which is very reasonable.The only negative point about is place is the friendliness of the staff as we had to call for somebody repeatedly to get something other than that this is an awesome place to have chinese,a must try.

I so love this restaurant. It is a small restaurant occupying the ground floor of a building situated just 2 min away from ¬†golpark. The restaurant is lightly dimmed and not so fancy but it is always full and we had to line in Que for 15 minutes. Since it is a small restaurant if you are going in a gang or you are in a hurry a prior table reservation is recommended.I have been there twice and it was never disappointing.Coming to the food we ordered fried chicken, chicken wantons,chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, hong kong chicken. Everything was delicious i would specially recommend the wantons. the quantity is more or less fine but if you have huge appetite you might finish one full bowl. All in all a good restaurant and they should invest in some decoration and publicity. The bill never exceeds 850 ( for 3 people) Do visit it.

This quaint little beauty is tucked away in a corner near Golpark. On entering, you are greeted by old school yet well maintained charming interiors. The prices of the items on the menu immediately take you 5 years back. The food is served hot and takes you to Chinatown without the hassles of actually visiting Tangra. Quantities are generous and the dry chilli chicken I tasted here are surely among the best I have had in Kolkata. The delectable fried rice left a great after taste in the mouth too. It‚Äôs a good restaurant if you happen to visit Golpark with your family and a great substitute to China Town.

Kimli is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant of south Kolkata. The place is small, but the sitting arrangements are quite comfortable. The service is prompt and the waiters are well behaved and can suggest good choice of combination if you are puzzled about your order. 
The ambiance is quite and friendly. The red theme of the restaurant can be seen on the walls the decorations as well. The crowed comprises generally family people so it's completely safe for girls. You can also take your partner for a nice dine out without burning a hole in your pocket. 
We ordered the spicy stir fried chicken, mixed fried rice, mixed rice noodles, lamb in oyster sauce. 
All the dishes had great taste. The chicken was really spicy with Chinese five spices. Both the mixed fried rice and rice noodles had plenty of veggies and meat. The lamb dish was also good but the lamb was bit chewy and my friend complained me about some smell but I couldn't find anything wrong with the dish. 
The foods were tasty with generous hospitality form the management. The low price all this makes this place an attractive destination. 
A must visit. In fact I am looking forward to my next visit. 
This time I couldn't upload any photo with my review as I lost all my phone data.

Chicken Drumstick in starters and Mixed Hakka Chow along with Garlic Chicken or Chilli Chicken in Maincourse. There are many dishes worth mentioning but alas I do not remember those. Hope you can find in their Menu list. 
All I can say they serve the best Chinese dishes with pocket  friendly rates.

I had been to Kimli last week for some evening snack. We ordered for Drums of heaven and another chicken starter (forgot the name but remember that the name starts with 'spicy'). The starters were nothing out of the world but the quantity was good enough going by the price. The service was laid back and orders took time to be served. Overall an ordinary experience and hence still a long way to go to quench the thirst of a FOODIE like me !

As one of the best Chinese joints in south Kolkata Kimli lives up to its reputation ! Not only is the food very tasty, but also the quantity is good and at a quite affordable price. Having started from a small and humble joint it has expanded into a cosy and comfortable restaurant !!
However the downside of the restaurant is that the order arrives usually 10 mins late. If that's not a hindrance then one must visit this place. 
The speciality includes Jumbo Prawn dishes, Crab Preparations, Soups, and Lollypops!!!!

This place is located in a lane near Golpark. It's a lovely eating joint, most suitable for school and college goers because of the affordable rates and the location. We ordered Mixed hakka noodles, Mixed fried rice, Chilli garlic noodles and Sweet and sour Chicken. The noodles and rice portions were just right and were decent in taste and the chicken pieces were really soft and succulent. they actually have eleven pieces of chicken per dish, each a bite-sized amount and it was more than enough. It's a good hangout place and yes, I would most definitely visit again for a casual dine-out.

Located in the lanes of gariahat, this place is a gem in itself. A moderately sized restaurant with a homely atmosphere which serves one of the best Chinese in Kolkata.. and undoubtedly the best duck dishes at surprisingly low prices.
Coming to food.. for starters we ordered duck teriyaki along with lung fong soup and hot nb sour soup.. I loved the duck teriyaki among all the dishes.. perfectly spicy and and juicy big sized pieces gave a great start to the lunch. The lung fong soup had a very different refreshing taste.. very light yet had lots of flavours in it which made it taste awesome.
For main course we ordered Singapore meifoons and chilly garlic bhetki. The Meifoons had lots of chicken prawn egg and tasted delicious.. one of the best tasting meifoons I have had in Kolkata.. the chilly garlic bhetki had plenty of soft fish pieces tossed in right amount of herbs and spices which gave it a lovely crisp outside.
The waiters are very helpful and cooperative.
Quantities are enormous in every dish.. 1 plate is sufficient for three.. the prices are unbelievably low.. I was surprised at the total bill of only 900 after having so many dishes with huge quantities.
Do try this place and I'm sure you'll love to visit again just like I do!!

The lollypops were great. I didnt even leave aside d fried garlics... But was not brave nuf to do so with d chillies thoughüòÇ
Do stay away from the chop sueys. They are simply horribly either tasteless or too sweet.
The rice and noodles come with no complains.

When i visited for the second time, i found the restaurant shifted to a new place. The ambience was mediocre and the food was nothing much to boast about. We orderd garlic chicken, chicken fried rice and mushroom soup. Food was good but the price has increased a bit.

It cannot be so that all 4 of us were wrong and we cannot distinguish b/w fish and cornflour.

Now coming to the food, we had a kungpao chicken, a mixed fried rice , Mandarin fish.
The quantity was absolutely enormous. And the mandarin fish was khooooooooooooob@ bhaaaaalooo khete!! Now i found the kung pao chicken a bit stale and not that good.
And the waiters were a bit snobbish... Anek bar dakte hochhilo just to get some water.

Kimli - a name in Chinese cuisine I have been hearing since a long time, so finally I went for it. This place is definitely easy on your pocket when it comes to quantity. We ordered the much talked about red chilli pepper chicken lollipop, mixed fried rice & Duck teriyaki.
AMBIENCE & DECOR - It's quite decent, nothing flamboyant but a nice little place.

QUANTITY- Huge portions, enough to feed two hungry souls. With only 3 dishes we were struggling to finish it.

TASTE - Now coming to the most important part, I didn't understand why is this place so much hyped?! Only the red chilli pepper lollipop is mention worthy. The mixed fried rice & Duck was so bland that I was immediately regretting eating there. The duck had more bone than meat & it was not at all tasty.

POCKET PINCH - It's easy on the pocket, our bill was only 515.
Overall I was disappointed with Kimli as I had more expectations!!

Heard about this place a lot but never tasted their food so went their for a Sunday dinner. I was so excited when I saw duck in the menu. I never tasted duck before so ordered a Szechuan duck with chicken fried rice. The amount is very good. The service was fast. The place was crowded and people were waiting outside. The rice was decent with many chicken and I also liked the duck. I found more duck bone than duck meat which was a little annoying. Decor is nothing extraordinary. This place is pocket friendly.

A good Chinese restaurant to fit every pocket. Good food, moderate ambience and quick service. Just a flavor of china town in gariahat, refreshment after shopping.
Above was my first review, now agaiin updating on 18 sep 2016. Their service degraded with time. Took one delivery today where they put veg chow in place of chicken hakka chow. And due to this embarrassment in a friends family gathering. 
Very very bad service, you should check what you are serving to customers. Lack of professionalism guys.

I went there with my family. Small place. Decoration like a restaurant, furnished like coffee house or dhaba.

The food is just okay. Though the duck I had was partly inedible. And the fried rice and noodles were just fine. Nothing worth going a second time for.

Kimli I have been frequenting way before the bigger apartment had been rented and since then it has satiated my Chinese food cravings in d most exceptional manner. However since it's more of an eatery service might not b as good but the food is great in quality quantity and taste.Its duck preparations are awesome and I might actually prefer its duck to duck in any other famous restro of this city.

Quality food at affordable price !

We went to the place after checking out many positive reviews on Zomato and we weren't disappointed at all !

Kimli is the perfect place to go if you're looking for a group treat or a delicious meal which is pocket friendly and multifarious. We ordered Mixed American Chopsuey, Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice, Bhetki Teriyaki, Chilli Garlic Babycorn and Mushroom and Veg Hakka Chow for a group of five and I must say the amount of each dish was more than enough! The chopsuey and the bhetki was really good. The chicken was yummy! Its a must have.

The ambiance wasn't too bad with a dimly lit hall which could be improved a bit. But, the decorations gave an authentic Chinese feel. The service is speedy enough with loads of options to choose from!

A must go place for all ! You won't regret it. :)

Food was horrible. We had ordered chicken prawn fried rice, in which the chicken and prawn were half boiled. And the rice had a very stale smell to it. With that we ordered Golden chicken which tasted okayish but was half boiled as well. Had to get the rice item changed. 
Will never visit again!

First things first, food was far below expectation. Ordered chilli garlic noodles & paneer chilli dry; the noodles were thick & there was no flavour of Garlic/chilli, the fried paneer felt oily & all the masala(onion/garlic/ginger) was replaced with big pieces of green chillies. Overall disappointing food quality. The decor is nothing to talk about; simple room converted into a restaurant. The furniture, cutlery, service & the overall ambiance needs improvement.

It was a sudden plan when we visit this place. It took us a while to find it, the main entrance of it was closed, so after searching for sometimes we found a side gate.

Coming to the ambiance, it was simple and decent. Nothing fancy or well decorated in my opinion.

We ordered chicken hakka noodles and dry chili chicken. Quality wise they were good and hot, also quantity was enough to serve to hungry souls. 

Price is moderate here.

Tell you what, they got very big items list. 

Located near Golpark, Kolkata.

A regular hub for me and my friends as it's location is very close to our college. We often drop by for a lunch. The restaurant can get crowded at times. But since they opened up the back shop which has more space, the waiting time has reduced considerably.
The food is always lipsmacking. Their duck preparations os amongst the top ones that I've consumed in thus city. The lamb is also delectable. My favourite is red hot chilli pepper chicken. A must try!service is prompt. Just that the staff can make you feel a bit rushed as they hover over you whilst you try to pick items from the menu.

The best thing that you get here is their chimney soup and almost all the items of duck and lamb....they have the unique recipes that I usually don't get anywhere.....the quantity of each and every dish is huge....1 dish can be shared by at least 3 people....but their serving speed is really slow....whenever I go there I have to wait for quite a while to get what I have ordered....they should also try to improve the interior of the restaurant....

I found out about Kimli through Zomato. This seems weird now 'cause when I mentioned it to my friends they all seemed to know the restaurant and they all seemed to love it. On hearing how it serves amazing Chinese at really affordable rates, I took a friend of mine (who has never heard about it either) to try out this place. And, sadly, I was quite disappointed.
It took us a while to find it. GPS pointed us to a shop that appeared closed. We were just getting ready to go back when some guys told us that the restaurant got renovated and the new one is just round the corner.
The ambiance was decent. We were at lunch time and it was almost full. Anyway, the waiter directed us to our seats. What was a little disappointing was they had no table for two. Oh well, that was nothing compared to the massive disappointment to come.
We ordered a Chicken Chinese Chopsuey, Teriyaki Duck and Chilli Garlic Chicken. First came the chopsuey, the gravy was really bland. I couldn't taste anything in it except a few pieces of chicken and veggies. Though, my friend, thought it was not too bad. So I will not blame it on them. We all have different palates. I found the duck pretty decent, but again my friend hated it. The dish was quite salty, and had very little meat, just a lot of bones and coating. The chicken dish was the worst. It was extremely salty to say the least. The gravy did not even have a scent of garlic but had a whole lotta chopped green chillies. We could not finish the gravy.
Service was more or less fast. The bill came to around 500. Yes, it is cheap, but considering the food we had, I wouldn't want to pay so much.

Very mediocre and average food. Located in Golpark this place is pretty near to where I live. (Why God why?! ) 
There are days when we have packed food for take away, the price is moderate to average just like their food. 
It is anything but tasty. 
Their chicken Cantonese chowmein is pretty decent but apart from that I don't find any dish worth paying for. 
Very disappointing decor, ambience & staff. Nothing good is going on for the place except for the location.

Awesome food!! Well, that's the reason y we go to a restaurant, and kimli satisfies that. Lacking a bit ambience, space is not big enough, very average decors but above average food in a reasonable price. Its one of my fav Chinese joint. The lamb items are great, loved the lamb in oyster sauce. Special duck teriyaki is my favourite. If u want chiken be a bit selective of wat u order. N off course the rice n noodles. Taste the corean rice. Loved it.

I went with a friend.The interiors is well done and pretty clean. Seating arrangement spacious though should not be able to stand a rush. The waiters have a i don't care whether you order or not attitude. They won't even help you if you ask them for a recommendation. The food to be fair is ok in quantity and quality. The food is not something you would remember or crave to go back. This is not an adda joint or somewhere where you come fondly or out of love for the food. This place is a resort for those people who are hungry and would like have enough food in a hygienic environment without worrying too much.

one of the visits has been my birthday treat to two of my friends :) must say the portion they serve is HUGE!! the taste also is yummilicious and yes, very easy on the pockets. i have tasted their mixed fried rice, mixed noodles, and two or three of their chicken items out of which corrainder chicken was the best! the lollipops also are great and yummy! #goodchinese# #mustvisit#

Well we, a gang of friends dropped in today. And our lunch was indeed awesome ! This is the first time i visited kimli. Well the ambience and decor is very decent and calm. Now coming to food, we ordered for egg chicken rice, kung pao chicken, golden chicken and red chilli lamb. Must say all were really superb. Kung pao chicken was average otherwise all other items really excelled as far as quality is concerned. And the quantity is something that truly stands out here. A single plate is enough to fulfil more than 2 hungry souls. Price is definitely pocket friendly. Hence kimli u were really successful in making me and my tastebuds super happy and satisfied :-D

Kimli located in one of the lanes off Gol Park has been serving up nice Chinese food since quite a while now.A few days back I visited Kimli after a long time and had a pleasant experience once again.

They have a shifted to a new place adjacent to the previous one.The new area is much more spacious and lacks a little in terms of the dimly lit oriental ambience which the older one provided.But the ambience and decor here is also quite decent.

Coming to the food,my friend and I ordered a Mixed Chowmein,a crispy konjee lamb and a duck teriyaki.The food arrived quite swiftly.The Mixed Chowmein was lovely comfort food as I would like to say.It was very simple yet tasty and filling for both of us.The Crispy konjee lamb had a lovely blend of spices and flavours.But I felt it was a tad over done.The Duck Teriyaki was decent.The gravy was nice and tasty but like always the duck preparations of Kimli contain a lot of coating to go with the meat.This is one perennial disadvantage when you order duck at Kimli.But overall we were satisfied with our food.

The prices are extremely reasonable.The duck preparations here are available at prices you cannot even think of getting elsewhere.Hence though they may not be the best but they are decent nonetheless and surely a value for money deal which is worth a try.The service is swift and the staff are all very polite and friendly.

In short Kimli is a lovely little chinese restaurant which I really like and this time around was no different.

Update review: 27. 04. 15: Have been to this outlet quite a few times since the review and my experiences have been a mixed bag... Liked some dishes and didnt like others... Okayish but not on my fav list
.....................................................................................

It was on the 25th Dec last year that we visited Kimli for the first time. Although we werent satisfied with the management that day, we decided to try it out once more yesterday. Well, I must say, the idea was right. 

To start with, the ambiance is nice-ish and so is the decor. Medium sitting arrangement. We ordered 2 special rice and spicy chicken.. The preparation was good though not extraordinary. The portions are quite huge and the price is really very economical. 

The only thing that was a bit of bother was the "too-spicy" nature of the chicken.... Will avoid spicy items here. Not the general range of spiciness that one gets. 

Overall, good!

You wouldn't be disappointed at all.. And the best part is that its not that expensive.. Its quite pocket friendly..
Its location is also one of its plus points, after shopping or colg near the gariahat or golpark area you can always go and have a good meal.. I always enjoyed the meals there am sure you too will..

For any die hard chinese cuisine lover,this has to be a place to visit.. My dad took me to kimli almost 5yrs ago for the first since i'm a chinese freak & i'm thankful that he introduced me to this place. It was small when i had visited it for the 1st time but now they have expanded & a good amount of places are available to have seated dining..

They serve varieties of items. I'v been here many a times but i usually opt for chicken friedrice,chilli chicken(dry/gravy),chilli fish & many more.. Also prawn pakoras,fish fingers are a must if you consider having some starters!! Prices are normal but they seriously serve some awesome & delicious food..

Did I ever tell you that Kimli is one of my 'favoritest' chinese restaurant? It was tiny till even last year, now they have taken up a bigger place in golpark. There is always a huge queue outside, but I assure you the wait is worth every penny!
Do not, do not eat for atleast 6 hours, before you get there, because you will want to hog after the first course!
Here's what I love the most:

1) Mixed gravy noodles - 'nuff said...
2) Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken in Black Bean sauce, Dry chilly chicken, Chicken in Hoisin Sauce, Chicken in Rice Wine Sauce, Lemon Chicken, Chicken with Bamboo shoots, Sweet and Sour Chicken...phew I could go on...
3) Chilly Duck, Teriyaki Duck
4) Shredded Lamb, Crispy Konjee Lamb
5) Steamed Chicken momo, Pan fried chicken momo
6) Mixed fried rice, chicken chow chow rice (chow chow rice is unique, it is gravy rice like gravy noodles - a must try)
7) Roast Duck - believe me or not, it is better than the one I had in Beijing...(order for this has to be placed one day in advance)
Service is very prompt and professional. Pricing is pretty much reasonable. Helpings are great for 2.

I will not write more, because I could write about each item on the menu, one more awesome than the other...so I would just say DO GO.

Had heard the name of this eatery reiterate in several food related convos with my pals...until i finally made an inpromptu plan to drop by...this saraswati puja...
we had to wait on the patio flanking the main entrance as there was barely any room inside...after after about 15mins we were admitted in
Famished as we were...we literally succumbed to the delectable delicacies mentioned in the bill of fare...confusion followed over what to order...

with further deliberations...we stuck to Paneer Vegetable Rice(one of my gfs was to have veg) accompanied by Stuffed Button Mushroom ¬†in Teriyaki Sauce...Chicken Hakka Chowmein and yes the most anticipated and apprehended Teriyaki Duck

We were made to wait about 20 mins ¬†before our order was served...
now,I am in a gruesome dilemna...I can't quite praise a particular dish with all my heart as it'd make me feel that I'm being unjust to the other dishes!!
I have never had a Rice prep that includes paneer as an integral part...and Kimli gave me a thousand reasons to do so,then on wards...I mean,like,its insane man!! Every time i dug my cutlery into that soft generous well rounded stuffed mushroom and paired it with some generous portion of rice...and took a gluttonous bite... I was bowled over..

When I took a portion of the Duck preparation on my platter,i was sceptical...but all that vanished into oblivion when i took the first bite...I was totally taken aback by the mastery which juxtaposed such super crisp and gravy texture right into one dish...notwithstanding the fact that the duck seemed a bit chewy...and more on the rough side...it tasted fabulous...especially when paired with Chicken Hakka Chowmein...

this was my maiden visit at Kimli's...and I am optimistic that during my future visits...Kimli will continue to surprise me...

great food...great place

If U want fierce Chinese food , Kimli is the right place to go .  The space is small so there is always a line to get in . They serve excellent duck and  lamb preparations . We had MIXED HOT & SOUR SOUP(which was dense and sweet) , LUNG FUNG SOUP , TALU MEIN SOUP , MIXED TOMYUM SOUP ,TERIYAKI DUCK(which was the best duck I ever had ) CRISPY KONJEE LAMB for starters . In the main course we had CHICKEN PRAWN MEIFOON , MIXED SHANGHAI (which was excessively spicy) , SZECHWAN FRIED RICE , HOT GARLIC LAMB , HUNAN CHICKEN and CHILLI GARLIC CHICKEN( which was again hot). Per head it costed us around Rs 300. The ambience is great and the paintings hanging on the wall set the mood .

Kimli was in my list since the time I have heard about their duck preparations.. A well known chinese joint located at just behind the Murlidhar Girl's College,Gariahut.. Lookwise the restaurant made me pleased.. A bright red wall with paintings hanging was quite a good impression.. At my very first visit I had their duck teriyaki.. The taste was amazing.. Chicken noodle soup was there to accompany the duck... I was quite satisfied with the taste and d service.. Then went there for second time N had chicken egg noodles with bambooshoot chicken.. The noodles was mindblowing.. But there was a smell in the chicken.. May be smell of bamboo shoots.. It was a unique dish I must say! Overall I had a nice experience with this restaurant.

I can't recall  exactly how many times I have eaten or ordered here. This small simple restaurant is really good. Their lemon chicken and sweet corn soup are simply  excellent. If you like Cantonese then the gravy noodles won't disappoint you. They have recently changed the decor and the present one doesn't look so cosy or oriental. Hence I deducted 1 point. But the food has stayed awesome over the years. It's not too expensive  as well and that makes this a perfect joint for those looking for good food at great prices.

Had a pathetic experience in kimli today...went there at around 2.30pm for a friend's b'day treat...we were 5 of us...4 were present and one would be joining us later...the guard was extremely rude and rightaway told us to wait till the last friend arrived...we told him politely to let us sit inside and order the food till that time but he said "no" and started arguing with us.I went to speak to the manager who was half asleep with his earphones plugged in...and i was shocked in the manner he spoke to us...i quote him" go out and wait outside till all 5 of you are here"...i would've understood if the restaurant was too crowded or something...but it was completely empty with only 2 tables occupied...utter disrespect...not going back ever and this was the 1st time i've faced such a thing and that also from a small restaurant like kimli!Terrible experience...went to another place at rash behari avenue which was buzzing with people and they ushered us in after a waiting time of 10-15min.

Good food. Variety is the keyword. Teriyaki lamb is great! I also like their soups, Ginger chicken and black pepper chicken. So is the meifoon. Fried Rice items could improve though... Why put onions in Chinese fried rice? Please omit that, tastes out of place.Tell if you don't want spicy items, they specialize in spicy food. One of the nicest Chinese restaurants around this area.

Kimli is one of those places where you go just for the food. The ambiance is nothing that exciting. A lot of effort has been put to give it a Chinese-y feel though. the food is the highlight. I had visited this place long back. and then again a few days back. Now they have re-done the place again and shifted to the adjacent building I guess. We ordered the Red Pepper Chilly Garlic Chicken which was quite the starters. They gave around 10 pieces and trust me, it was really good! This was followed by the Chicken American Chopseuy and Szechuan Duck. I had absolutely no complaints about the food. The quantity is quite a lot. Two of us, even though we are decent enough eaters, couldn't finish it. The service is nothing to talk about. Its just good and normal,¬† nothing extraordinary. 
To top it all, the prices are fairly reasonable! This is a great option for a peaceful meal at affordable prices! :)

Yes, I would go back there again, just to try the different meat preparations. The food here is top class!

Note: Visited Kimli again on Christmas, tried the Lamb in Oyster Sauce. It was, in one word, heaven. For Chinese, this is MY place!

Food: The best restaurant for Chinese food. They have very different items and they prepare it with utmost sincerity. Must try stuffed mushroom gravy. Do remember to tell them you want it less spicy because they have a tendency to use more spices. I rate it 4.5/5.

Ambience: I used to like the old room more. It was small yet cosy with dim lights and had the perfect Chinese ambience with wall hangings and Chinese horoscope on the tables. The new hall is kinda spacious but sports a very ordinary just-another-restro look. Though it is evident they are not yet done with decorating the place. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Speed is medium. Staff is well-behaved. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Slightly costlier than standard Chinese restaurants but totally worth it.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

Horrible is one word which best describes kimlis food. My mum almost died of food poisoning after we had dinner there. Avoid it like the plague. For that price Hatari or China white is a much better option in the region. Read my review of the joint also on tripadvisor. Thanks

A minute's walk from golpark, kimli provides a wonderful option for a peaceful meal on a Sunday afternoon as we discovered. To begin with, we had pepper garlic chicken and lung fung soup. The soup was absolutely delicious and went very well with the chicken. Infact we liked the soup so much we took another one for home. This was followed by chicken rice noodles, spicy chicken and prawn teriyaki. The rice noodles had enough shreds of chicken, the prawn balls were tender and the spicy chicken which although the name suggests was not very spicy. The quantity was enough for two hungry tummies and the bill amounted to ‚Çπ920 with a soft drink. Although the place was dimly lit and the service was not satisfactory, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and do look forward to another visit.

Kimli is a Chinese restaurant located just behind ¬†Golpark american tourister outlet. A little bit inner from the main road. The ambience is neither so impressive nor so bad. The quantity of food can easily fill two hungry stomachs and the main plus point that the food is very cheap. This is an ideal miser place. Now about the food, I ordered ¬†Corean fried rice ( contains rice with egg, chicken and prawn ) , Malaysian chicken ( spicy) and Chicken pan friend momo ( 12 pieces ). The Corean fried rice was very tasty and there were some very big size prawns and the rice cooked a little bit softer than normal ¬†fried rice. But i disappointed when I tasted the malaysian chicken because it was too salty. Pan fried momo was oily and below standard. According to me Kimli is an average restaurant and a lot of improvements are still needed. I wouldn't recommend this place to any food lover.

This one of the most amazing restaurants I have ever been to. Thanks to a friend who suggested me this place. It serves good food at good prices. I believe because of the location of the place, many people do not know about this place even though they live in Southern Kolkata, this is probably the USP of this joint. It provides a homely atmosphere where you may take all the time in the world to chat,enjoy and dig into the lovely food they serve you, you don't get pushed in the face with the bill (something which happens in the most restaurants these days, which is a sugarcoated way to say GET OUT!) and the service is quite fast and welcoming. All in all be there to try it, you won't be disappointed...Its near Golpark...

The location of the restaurant is quite interior from the main roads.The ambience is satisfying. The food served were really tastier and of good quality. Quantity also seemed good. . Infact if you take 1 bowl rice it's sufficient for two (ofcourse appetite may vary ) . Chinese items served are really good, and I landed up satisfying my tummy during the durga puja days. Spent a great time here.. Good hospitality too. I would love to go again. And most importantly it suits your pocket.

The restaurant is not spacious, which means more often than not, you will have to wait outside for sometime. However once you look at their menu card and taste the food, this small flaw is easily over looked. I mean the variety of dishes served in Kimli at such a low price is a food lover's dream place. And they also have the option of take-away(in microwave resistant boxes)in case your belly is full and you cannot have anymore.:)

Kim Li-One of the small nicest Chinese restaurant that you can¬† find in South Kolkata.Ambiance-Earlier It had a small space but recently they expanded their space and became medium type¬† restaurant,service is good.
Food-For starters,I will recommend you Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken(only for those people who can eat spicy,really spicy food),then for main course you can try Cantonese noodles or Fried Rice(any choice) and for side dishes you have to try the Lamb and Duck,both are exquisite.The quantity is very good in this place.
¬†If you want to try eating Chinese with their own style,you can have Chopsticks to try in this place.

Went to this restaurant with my partner. The restaurant is located near goal park but it will take time to find the restaurant. Heard their duck preparations were good so we wanted to try it. We ordered Szechuan duck, mixed fried rice and Szechuan chicken. Szechuan duck was filled with bones and could have been better, but it was tasty.. mixed fried rice and Szechuan chicken were also nicely cooked. Interior of the restaurant was well maintained and the staff's were well behaved. Overall a good restaurant to visit.

Located near Hindustan Park is Kimli. A couple of years ago this restaurant used to be stuffy and it was all cramped up inside. But now it's renovated. The inside of the restaurant is decorated by abstract artwork all over the walls. The ambiance inside is very good and hygienic. And the restaurant serves authentic Chinese food. Most of the items are decent with the prices not being too high. The lamb items are one that deserves mentioning. Though I personally didn't like the duck dishes served. But in all its a good place to dine with your family or friends.

Have been here a couple of times with friends. Personally, I kind of find this place really cute. With those overhanging Chinese lanterns and the soft dim light, it for sure gives that pleasant feel. Not very spacious though, may be that's why I felt it's cute. There is one aged-staff over there who literally monitors and suggests you dishes when asked, & is pretty adept at it.
Coming to the food, YES, you will be happy. Quantity is totally satisfactory.
We placed an order of Lung Fung Soup, Mixed Fried Rice, Szchuen Fried Rice, Chilly Garlic Chicken and Sliced Fish in White Sauce. Fish Lovers, don't even blink twice to call for this fish-preparation. It's worth it. Rest were tasty too.
And then goes the price, I would say very reasonable, given the quantity and quality.
More than one-visit restaurant, it is. :)

Was looking for a decent place for trying out lamb near tollygunje and stumbled upon Kamli. As heard from many a friends the ambience was good. Me and a friend of mine got out of office early and headed straight for Gariahat. Located in a peaceful locality, this place is a perfect harmony between class, taste and value for money. 
The food ordered was chilly lamb for starters and haka noodles with chicken in oyster sauce for the main course. 
My tip to people trying out new variety of food is that go for the most spicy item, the spice hides the smell and chilly brings out the taste. So, started with the chilly lamb which was yummy enough for both of us to decide that we'll be back soon. Haka noodles and chicken were equally good. 
The ambiance was good, service was better and the prices are dirt cheap. The total bill including the mentioned stuff and soft drinks was a mere rs. 583/-. 
And yes, am coming back again to try out their chilly duck next.

Well after five years i visited this joint and i noticed a lot of changes which i like. Previously it was a very small room where seats and tables were very close to one another and the no.was limited. Now the ambiance has changed with a larger room, different get up with all abstract art works on the walls..old fashioned doors, beautiful false ceiling and yellow lights. We ordered teriyaki duck, prawn claws in black bean sauce and shredded lamb. I just loved the duck and lamb preparations but i didn't like the taste n smell of black bean sauce. next time i would love to taste other crab recipes and prawns. Chinese tea is not available there though it is written on menu card. Service is good and price is reasonable and pocket friendly.

I am not disappointed neither am I overwhelmed with the food that I had at Kimli. Going with the zomato rating, people must think this is a great joint, but however, it is quite ordinary and nothing to go gaga over it, in my opinion.¬†

I visited with a friend of mine to this small joint on Saptami evening. Shoddy joint and shoddy service as well. The waiters were not courteous, though we cannot expect that from such a joint as well and they were quite blatant as well and somewhere hard on you. We took chili pepper chicken dry and Crispy chili mushroom and babycorn. Since it was just six in the evening we decided to eat just appetizers. The food appeared quite soon and it was hot. The name of the chicken was made fruitful by adding uncountable number of chilis in it. I don't know how could a person possibly eat the dish when the whole plate has more amount of chili than the chicken. The chicken tasted like any other starter and goodness knows how much amount of salt was put in it. The babycorn was comparatively bland and hence it acted like a neutralizer. Good tactic of balancing the veg with non-veg, I must say which is absolutely undesirable and unnecessary.¬†

I was recommended this place by a friend of mine and I must tell you, friend, I was absolutely not moved or excited by this place, rather, I would avoid visiting this place again.

I think their best dishes are chicken lollypop and chicken in red sauce..any of these dishes with hot soup is an awesome combination. But they have degraded because we tried the Golden friend prawn and it was not even properly fried and was not hot. On complaining, they just microwaved the same thing and served us and even the chicken lollipop was upto the mark. I am not going here anymore as their food quality has degraded like anything. Hope you guys improve soon.

Disappointed, disappointed.
Visited twice, first being more than a year back.. had wontons and duck-- not impressive. Yesterday, had chimney soup and american chopsuey - both disheartening and could not finish either. Chimney soup was no chimney soup at all - only some tiny pieces of meat thrown into a starch-puddle with 500gm of cabbage (my partner hates cabbage..so imagine his agony).Chopsuey was likewise-starchy-tasteless(only hot sour tomato ketchup was striking us).just minimal amount of protein to be found.
The serve huge amount - and charge equally for that. But not worth.
I am not visiting again.

I was recommended Kimli by my Aunt who is a bit of a foodie. Kimli is a tiny eatery almost hidden from view; very easily missable. Thankfully there is a big sign that says KIMLI very prominently. The ambiance is one of a small wooden Asian hut in some remote part of Tibet. The door is designed with Chinese and Tibetan glass art and the walls are beautifully, yet simply decorated with Asian artwork. The whole place has an aura of rustic simplicity. This very small, relatively quiet place¬†seats a maximum 25-30 people at full capacity so there is a line usually outside. When you sit down and look at the menu, you'll be dumbfounded with their options. It provides you with a taste from all over South East Asia. From Tibet, to the different parts of China to Vietnam. Apart from the cuisines, they have a wide selection of dishes. From your traditional chicken to lamb, prawn and duck; some dishes you wouldn't normally find in your everyday Chinese restaurant. However the names were all¬†peculiar and some, I¬†couldn't¬†even¬†pronounce. When the food does come, the portions are ENORMOUS! 1 large order of soup fed 5 people easily. Same goes for the noodles and¬†pretty¬†much everything else. So before you order, you should ask the waiters how much a portion is or else you are more than likely to over-order and waste a lot. I ordered a duck and a lamb dish with gravy, and what hit me right away when I took my first bite was that the gravy was very rich, almost too rich. As a result you tend to get very full by eating little. What made my experience at Kimli not a very pleasant one was that we paired the rich duck and lamb with a rich gravy Cantonese noodles unknowingly. I feel that the waiters, who are¬†acquainted¬†with the food, should have told us what kind of noodles we were ordering. If he had, we would have ordered something lighter like Hakka. It¬†was bad waitering and as a result I was unable to fully enjoy my meal. On the other hand the prices are really cheap, REALLY cheap for the¬†quantity¬†of food you get.¬†Kimli is a great place to go for the Asian¬†cuisine¬†loving and the¬†adventurous¬†provided you know what you are ordering.

My ¬†go to place for soup and starters... the soups here are made to perfection with all the proper and exotic veggies used inside it... after renovation this place has become even better than before and going here is always enjoyable... they have been here from a long time and for sure they are here to stay cause their food has never changed in quality and it just absolutely is amazing....¬†

it is a small place but it delivers the punch that is needed in that side with authentic Chinese and the dishes made to perfection...

the veg Manchurian which is a problem in any other place is soft and tender in Kim li and the hot and sour soup is just fantastic with mushrooms in it...

more so the main course is also pretty good and up to the mark to enjoy.... the pocket pinch for the same is not that high but for people visiting this place for years the prices have gone up quite a bit...

alltogether be it a take away or dine in this place never fails to deliver and the waiting staff are normally friendly and know what is on the menu and what is it the details of every dish....¬†

an enjoyable place with great food...

last week I heard from a friend that there is a restro in golpark which possibly serves the best duck in town and that is a very small little joint near golpark beside bedwin. I was amazed at the fact that how I have never noticed kimli as I frequently visit gariahat and golpark. Had plans of meeting a friend yesterday.  Decided we would rush to golpark to have lunch at kimli. Post shopping at gariahat, we started heading towards kimli. On reaching we desperately surfed through and finally entered kimli. The nice decor outside struck me. On entering I found it was a small little eatery which could hardly accommodate 16 people. The decor was plaintiff. Laterns hanging and the lights being dim gave us a feeling that we were yet back to another chinese restro. So typical a decor of eateries that serve chinese. I wanted to have crispy konjee lamb as the starters but my friend didnt quite prefer lamb. So he decided we go in for something else. then the waiter suggested we should go in for the duck. Without even thinking twice we knew what we wanted. Teriyaki duck it was was. The waiter suggested we should go in for the special teriyaki duck dry, he also told us it would not be boneless. What I would like to share is they are bad with c rockeries.  One of the plates fell on my friend's lap and thankfully it was saved from shattering. And then it came. It looked great, smelt greater and tasted greatest. I have tried pekking duck at mainland china and tung fong. But this was by far the best preparation. The duck was succulent , the fried covering of the duck dipped in the teriyaki sauce was the oommppphh factor. This was the best starter I have possibly eaten. Then came in the main course. I wanted to do gravy chowmein and nothing beyond mixed cantonese noodles could serve my purpose. I had heard praises about the green chilli chicken so that was on my mind. Placed the order , but the waiter suggested that green chicken would be more of gravy and he suggested we go in for red hot pepper chicken. We agreed as we thought that rheir suggestion would be the best .Indeed it was great. I loved the whole thing. The cantonese noodles were great and the fried noodles added to the flavour. The chicken was out of the world. And the quantity they provide is too much fpr 2 people. I would suggest not to go in for a starter if you are 2 in number. A highly recommended chinese eatery. Will revisit as soon as possible.

In one tiny corner of the junction of  Purna Das Road and Hindustan Park,stands this small eatery.
The interior deco ain't so impressive or very eye catching, but the food is all that really impressed me.
If you are a group of hungry 20 bikers then head to this tiny place(of course you have to put a check on the drinks-strictly no alcohol).
Head to this place for a modest dinner on a winter night/after a brisk evening walk with your partner.
For the food the Chicken Teriyaki is the best preparation over here.The meat is really soft and juicy.Along with this dish you may try out the Singapore Mein Foon.Another alternative is the Kung Pao Chicken.
Hardly any desserts here to serve.So instead opt for a few glasses of Cola.
Overall this place is good for a small eat out, as a first date tidy enough to impress your lady.Service needs to speed up but the staff are helpful and well behaved.
Would request the management to take some measures to improve this restaurant and make it even bigger and better.

They say good things come in small packages. This saying aptly fits Kimli. Located near golpark Bedwin, this a small restaurant that can barely sit 15-20 people at a time. But dnt go by the size, coz they churn out some real good food. My all time favorite is the mixed Cantonese noodles. The noodles are fried crisp and the gravy had just the right amount of corn starch to not make it too thick. Team it up with a dry chilli chicken and you cnt go wrong. Or if you like your side a bit spicy and hot, try the hot garlic or schwezan chicken. I have also tried the Kung Pao chicken and it tastes fantastic. 
The fried rice is good and I like chicken fried rice more. Recently I had fish in black bean sauce and it was delicious. The chicken with oyster sauce, which I ordered as a second side,was a bit bland, but my father quite liked it. The momos and the sweet corn chicken soup are good to fill your tummy when you need a quick bite.

This place is the best for a quick little lunch or dinner with friends or family. The place would not impress you with it's decor or space. But wait till you try out it's food. Chicken Teriyaki blew me over. The meat was soft and succulent. For mains, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Kung Pao. The Kung Pao was brilliant and the portion of the rice was huge. And, ever since I keep coming back for the absolute lip-smacking Kung Pao. The prices are pretty affordable and when in Gariahat, it is a must visit.

If you are in the Gariahat- Golpark area, do drop into this quaint little restaurant that will surely not impress you with its exuberant decor or seating. However, the food they serve is quite something else altogether. It is one of the best Chinese eateries in the area. I have visited this place on numerous occasions and have found them to be consistent with both their service and food. Most of the soups they serve are amazing. If you are looking for appetizing starters, try out their momos- they are worth every buck. The green chili fish is another dish to savor. The red pepper chicken lollipop tastes fantastic too. I didn't like their rendition of the chow chow rice, however, the gravy noodles tastes amazing. If you like lamb preparations, then the Crispy Konji Lamb is a good option.

If you are looking for Kolkata style chinese, then this is one place other than Tangra, where you can satisfy your craving, and the best part, it doesn't even pinch your pocket. Though the place is too cramped and might be claustrophobic for many, but then we all know, the big things come in small packages. The service is very prompt, and the food is just awesome. try out just anything from their menu and be assured to have a good experience.

The place is suitably located in Purna Das Road, pretty close to the Gariahat flyover on the Golpark side and because of its location, the restaurant attracts quite a number of people, rookie and veterans alike. The restaurant is highly convenient for those who have got their workplaces in the vicinity of Gariahat as it meets almost everyone's budget. There would be hardly anyone who had come to know of Kimli and had not paid a visit at least once.
Coming to the dishes they serve, they would definitely rouse your gustatory sensation, if not titillate the same. The dishes are well cooked with nearly the flawless blend of the spices. The soups are also very pleasing to the taste buds. The lambs are delicious too. The ambiance is perfect for celebrating one's birthday (if one is planning to do so). The staffs are patient as well as co-operative. However, on a slightly negative note, upon my latest visit, the Red Pepper Chili Garlic Chicken did not taste like the one as I had savored on the previous occasions. Nevertheless, this is the place where you shall feel comfortable and contended with your buddies as well as your family.

You know what they say about first impressions being last impressions? Well, Kimli proves that wrong. The place is pretty cramped with no more than 5 or 6 tables, the interiors aren't exactly great with the ambience leaving a lot to be desired, so it loses half a point for that. 
Now, the main thing for any foodie- the food! 
Yes, the food is the best part about this place, as it should be. We ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Duck Teriyaki and Chili Lamb. Pretty normal fare i know, but I wasn't in the mood to experiment right then. The Teriyaki was pretty normal, nothing great and the stuffing wasn't that good, but that's probably just me. The lamb was what blew me over completely. The meat was soft and tender, and juicy. It was beautifully done. The Fried Rice was good, with the portion being huge. Enough for two people who love to eat. 
Ambience: 2.5
Food: 4.5
Service: 4.5

It all depends on what is a priority for you: the food or the place. A tiny place, Kimli offers indoor and outdoor comfort with a regular Chinese menu. Since Chinese is the second staple for the city, no one complains about the little spicy, Indian version of the Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Kung Pao Tiger Prawns or Prawn Thai Noodles. i also had the lamb here which i think is the best i have had. But i must add the duck here is just not worth having. We had ordered teriyaki duck and it was extremely salty, though they mellowed it down a bit when we asked for it but i would say avoid the duck. Its a waste of money.

It was a lovely experience. The place is small, cozy decor but the food quality will simply amaze you.
We tried the chicken sweetcorn soup for starters. Very well prepared
Then had bhetki fish red chilli pepper dry preparation. Very tasty
Had two different chow meins. The thai chicken chow was a mix of great flavours. 
Also tried the lamb here, Its soft but as it is a chinese preparation, you won't find much taste. 
I would love to go to this plave

A good and affordable air-conditioned restaurant. Suits very well to the pocket!
Food is great.
If you are having Mein foon (Rice noodles) you can easily order one plate for two big eaters and still have some left.  They serve quite an amount.
Teriyaki Chicken among the side-dishes is really good!

A good chinese resturant with quality food but a very average look. Kimli appears to me as a local resturant located near my house which serves delicious chinese cuisine at a really low price. However the ambience is not that much impressive. So if you really care only about the food and not about the ambience then this is surely the place for you.

----- UPDATE -----
‚Ä∫ May 2015:
Kimli has shifted to a new location which is adjacent to the previous one at Hindustan Park. Yes, don't sigh and return if you see the red shutters of the previous outlet down. The ambiance has been slightly improved, lighting enhanced, and number of tables increased. The food quality is as good as before, with the Chicken Meifoon (Rice Noodles) still being one of my all time favorites. Teriyaki Chicken was really good, a tad too much salty though. But really good on the whole.

‚Ä∫ July 2014 :
After hearing a lot of this place, my friend and I decided to give it a shot for lunch. Locating it was pretty easy (courtesy, Google Maps!), and i expected the entrance to be better. Inside, the ambiance was pretty cozy.
Although their seating was limited, we, the hungry souls were lucky to get a table as soon as we got it. Cheers!

Coming to the food, we ordered common dishes which more or less satisfied us. The fried rice and rice noodles (meifoon) were okay-ish. I liked the Lamb in oyster sauce, and the Hong Kong chicken was good (ignoring the unusual smell which I have never encountered in a chicken dish).
Prices were extremely reasonable.
Above all, we were totally blown off the huge portions they gave! An extra star for that.

The prime location and good food makes Kimli a must-try. Planning another visit very, very soon!

I went to this Restaurant too many times in my collage days as its nearest and cheapest restaurant in Golpark area. That time I really don't care about the service of waiters because the food was really good and also cheap as well as. But I went there last Saturday 5th of July 2014 and here is my recent experience.

Service : Really horrible service from start to end. At first I asked to the security guard "We are 5 peoples, how much time will take to get a table" and then he just shake his head (nothing replied), so I crosschecked him that "Is the service of the restaurant is end or anything else happened" (as I was able to see through the semi transparent glass that people are eating inside), then he said it will take 25-30 mins to give us a table because all tables are full and we ware agreed to wait. After 5 mins he said that we can go inside because one table is available. we entered and saw the table which was allotted to us is not cleaned. I asked a waiter "Please clean this table" he replied "Sure Sir..!!" but we have to wait more than 5 mins for this. The waiter given us plates but the problem is those are not same, in one table we ware seeing 3 different type of printed plates. During the time when we are started eating and after a couple of mins I suddenly noticed that one of the waiter is standing beside our table and looking right to our table, and whenever we finished our one dish he just grabbed the plate without any request, But after 3 times he didn't appear beside to our table. 

Food : we ordered 2 Mixed American Chop Suey, 1 Mixed Fried Rice, 1 Mixed Veg (Dry), 1 Chilly Garlic Noodles and 1 Chilly Garlic Chicken (Dry). The American Chop Suey was good, the noodles was good too, but the chicken was too dry and overcooked, the mixed rice is totally bland and no season in there and the veg dish was given in gravy, when I asked them to change that dish because we ordered dry that time they said that dish always comes in gravy, I just went to the counter and asked to manager for my order ticket to show them that the waiter who taken the order from us he written dry beside the veg dish and after some argument I able to proof that. so I asked them to change that 2 dishes then they told me it will take one hour or more because they already have lots of orders. so I just paid the bill and walked out from the restaurant.

THIS RESTAURANT IS ONLY HIGH RATED BECAUSE OF THERE CHEAP PRICE MENU

MY ADVISE TO THE RESTAURANT OWNER : PLEASE TEACH SOME MANNERS TO YOUR STUFFS AND TRY TO HIRE GOOD COOK AS YOU HAD FEW YEARS AGO.......!!!!!

PROS :
1. good food
2.great ambience
3.the seating area is quite cozy.
4.the location is good.

CONS :
1.though the seating area is cozy , it needs to be a lil bigger.
2.the entrance and the outer decor looks shabby (for a restaurant so old and famous)

But I am definitely going back there again because of the yummy food amd the quick service. :)

Kimli is definitely a place for some good pocket friendly Chinese. The food is great with amazing flavours. The quantity that each portion serves is a lot. There's some really impressive variety on the menu and the service is quick.The place is a little cramped. Its definitely hard to acquire a place at Kimli if you're looking out for a Saturday dinner, which means long hours of waiting. But I guess its worth it. A must try restaurant :)

Average food quality with quantity which is okay not too much or too less. I didnt like the ambience of the restsurant which is too small to enter with your group but okay for 2 or 3 people. Not awesome but okay with reasonable price.
Visited this place today again to have dinner with my friends. Okay. Disgusting food I had today. The good thing were the place is bigger than what it was though not cozy enough. The chairs are not so comfortable and the service is also good but the main thing that is the food. It is disgusting. We wanted to try duck for the first so we ordered teriyaki but it was too salty that we had to replace it with another though the saltiness decreased a little but the taste remained the same. Apart from this we had mixed fried rice , noodles and one chicken side dish. It was not good .I won't recommend anybody to try here. If you want to try here try at your own risk .
At first I rated it 3 but now I am changing it to 2.

Kimli - Horrible and unexpected experience at this place!!!!!
=======================================
Location:

It is located near Hindustan Park..well if you are going from delices towards Bliss/azad hind, you need to take the first right before bliss/azad hind and after crossing The restaurant on the first floor and two lanes take the left and on the right side, you discover Kimli. On my brothers request, i had planned to go to this place with him as he said he had tried the food two times and it was good every time.
=======================================
Food ordered:

1) Chicken Szechuan Fried Rice - The rice turned out to be good having the perfect amount of spice. 

2) Chicken Chilly Garlic - It was a gravy dish and had 2-3 PRAWN PIECES in it. I was quite horrified on how can they serve me PRAWN instead of CHICKEN. On my first byte, i told my brother that the taste is different. Later on, he could also identify that it was not chicken but was PRAWN. It had more than appropriate amount of Garlic and Chilli's. It pissed my mood real bad and the staff did not have even the courtesy to say SORRY? I mean what is this. 

3) Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles (with less of Chilli's) - We packed this dish. Believe me or not. This noodles had SAND particles which was cracking in the teeth while eating them. This shocked me like real bad. 
=======================================
Pros:

1) Prompt service.
2) Ambience is good.
3) Pocket Friendly.
4) Good quantity on gravy dishes.

Cons:

1) Hospitality needs improvement.
2) Cramped seating arrangement. 
3) Bad quality of Food. The gravy chicken had inappropriate amount of Ajinamoto(Chinese Salt) and lot of arrowroot on the chicken layering. 
=======================================
Summary:

Food quality 3/5
Food quantity 3.5/5
Hospitality 3/5
Value for money 3.5/5
Taste 3/5
Service messed my mood real bad. 
=======================================
Conclusion:

As per my review, this place did not attract me much because of the terrible service offerings. With respect to the price charged, it is quite easy on pockets but my experience went quite horrible. Because of these mistakes, a customer like me would never like to come back again.

My favourite place for chinese in the Golpark area.. Have been there a lot of times with friends and family. Do try this place if you are in Golpark-Gariahat area. The best pick is the Red pepper chili garlic lollypop. It is heavenly.. and you will literally lick your fingers :).. Among other dishes,the Thai soup, Green cantonese noodles,Chilli garlic noodles, Spicy fish,Teriyarki fish,Chilli garlic crab claws,Chilli lamb are the best ones. Do give it a try and you will never regret. Such good food at such good price :)

Food is delicious,properly cooked , great quality still now.. And I keep visiting there often.
I will always recommend this cute little restaurant to grow the love for Chinese and its within budget.

I have been to this place twice, the first time I went was last year and the high ratings given to this Outlet was justified with the quality of food they served at the most competitive prices, but recently when I visited the place i was shocked and appalled at the state of affairs. 

The chicken was not properly cooked , it was high on salt and the people running the place were very rude when told about the problem. Not going again in the future. I would rather go to Calcutta Bistro which offers similar if not better food at better prices and great service. 

This place is not worth 4 stars now.

KIMLI
PURNA DAS ROAD.HINDUSTAN PARK

Kimli is one of my favorite restaurants f all time , had a specifically nice n fun time with someone to bridge a gap. there has been some changes structurally , but the food is the same and so is the service, although I liked the previous sitting arrangements as it was cozy but nevertheless.

As it must be evident , i love chicken and Chinese food. Kolkata has seen a sharp rise in the number of Chinese joints that have sprung up but kimli holds firm ground among them. The ambiance is calm n soothing and it has a wide variety of fish n fowl items to lend a serene tinge to your taste buds, it has fish, chicken, lamb, crab,duck, prawn ( WOW ) . The chilli duck is a favorite so is the schezwan chicken and the gravy chicken chowmein too, as they use fresh mushrooms in it. Its light on the pocket, i go there whenever i have a hankering for chicken and i would suggest the same for you too.

One of the new found favorites is the CHICKEN LOLLYPOP"see pic" ( ask for the spicy one) , lip- smacking 10 pieces of gastronomical niravana, perfectly fried, spiced to suit the palate the crust on the outside, the moist juicy chicken on the inside, make a point to have this crowd pleaser when u pay a visit to Kimli.

VERDICT- A crowd favorite and a place to enjoy good food with friends and family alike, No pork items might be a bummer for some. Must ask for the lollipop spicy chicken.

But food has always good here. And quantity like those in China Town. And price too.
So near golpark and this is our choice till now. No hassle service and sitting arrangement.
Dishes which are old and gold --- Kans Kicw Lamb, Hot Garlic Chicken, Pan Fried Prawns, Dry Chilli chicken, The Gravy Cantonese Noodles, Their Chicken Sweet Corn, Green Chilli Chicken etc...
I still like this place--- wish the ambiance would become better!!

Located at quite a comfortable location, just a min walk from Golpark, this place attracts people who specially loves Chinese. Though the ambience is a bit dark and Okay-ish, the food over here more than makes up for it. Each and every dish over here, I tried till now is quite a delight. The Spicy Hunan Chicken along with Mixed Rice is the most common thing i rely on when I dont try to experiment and try out new dishes. the pocket pinch over here is also quite reasonable which is like 450 for couple. Once you try out food over here, you'll return to this place again n again, GUARANTEED !

This small hermit in one of the in lanes of Gariahat/Golpark goes often unnoticed thanx to it's location,but if you come across it any time while searching for a decent place to eat then don't hesitate. It is one of the best pocket friendly chinese restaurant in Kolkata and I strongly recommend a visit. I had their Tom Yum soup which was fyn followed by mixed chowmein,green chilli chicken and golden chicken with all of them tasting brilliant. I am looking forward to taste their ducks and lambs preparation ewhich I am sure will live upto their standard. On the negative side is that,the place is too small and congested a bit,so will recommend to keep it out of your list during Durga puja and other holidays. Thumbs up from me

This was my first visit to Kimli, a small outlet in Hindustan Park. The ambience and staff are quite unimpressive. Bright lights and very basic tablewares give the feeling of a non descript local eatery. The washroom is dirty and stinking. However the only reason worth visiting the joint is its food. We tried chicken hot and sour soup, fried chicken wantons, Cantonese gravy noodles and chilli garlic fish. The noodles were slightly overcooked and wantons were bit dry. But the soup and the fish were awesome. The portion size was enough for two. The price is easy on your pocket but I don't expect a pricier menu given the very basic ambience. Recommended for a casual eat out with friends and families.

Ambience: Kimlis just shifted to a newer and bigger location nearby.The previous place looked cramped but had a better feel to it with its red lights n ol.Hence ambience is not good at all.However what makes kimli a winner is its food.The menu is a big one and the food is awesome.Quantity is great and price is reasonable.I have tried almost all of the dishes there n more often than not I have come out a happier person. Don't go for the teriyaki duck or the chicken sweet n sour though.Service is decent.

Nice little place serving mouth licking Chinese food. Their service too bad,too impolite.Crockery and serving plates are real bad.Better to take the food home.And always remember to keep change.....they never have.

Kimli is one of those places which you visit for the food they provide. 
It is located in Purnadas road, easy to locate. The inside is very plainly set, not at all decorated, with very plain tables and chairs. It clean however. The ambiance thus is not very well done, which does not give you a fine dining feel the moment you step in.
However i would suggest you to stick around just for what comes next.
The menu is neat, wit almost all you may want in the menu. Order away since i don't suppose anything can disappoint you much.
For Duck lovers, if there are any, I would say the Duck in Teriyaki sauce is a must try. It is delicious. 
Other personal favorites are listed below :
Crispy Konji Lamb
Chicken chili Garlic Noodle
Chicken in Black Bean Sauce
The Chinese has a tilt towards Bengali Chinese, especially by the look. However it tastes absolutely perfect in my opinion. 
The servers are formal and nice.
Service is on time, you dont have to wait for long.
Finally it is pocket friendly.
Don't let the ambiance disappoint you. Go ahead and try it! :) Have Fun.

If you haven't visited this place then I guess you are missing out, just to let everyone know the original place has been shut
for reasons unknown to me probably renovation and they have shifted nearby just opposite to PC Chandra jewellers.
I was there last Sunday for dinner and since I was hungry I went straight for the main course which was mixed cantonese hakka and red pepper chicken without the gravy and with the quantity that they serve it's always enough for 2. Over the last couple of years since I started visiting the place I have tried their various fish, duck and needless to say chicken dishes and I personally never had a complaint with the taste and on all these occasions never has my bill crossed Rs.600. So finally - a decent chinese restaurant with an extensive menu (one may not get everything on the menu though), nice quiet locality, service is okay if not good and most importantly its value for money keeping in mind the prices which are very reasonable so it checks all  the right boxes for me.

Kimli is a place all south Kolkata residents love and frequent to satisfy their chinese cravings. And for good reason. Theyserve Kolkata chinese, that is extra salty and you cannot help but keep coming back for more. I ate there recently again, this time only a mixed hakka chow, chilli garlic crab claws and lamb in oyster sauce. The noodles were super tasty, something that even big expensive chinese places can't manage. The crab claws is something we order everytime we go there. I have to admit that it was a bit doughy this time around. The lamb was fantastic and came with so much meat that two of us were unable to eat all of it. I also like their teriyaki duck though this too tends to be doughy sometimes and the duck a bit tough, but on a good day its worth ordering. They have a green rice which is also a favourite. But they have some bad days when the food is not that great. Also they are not giving home delivery anymore which is a bummer.

I have been here thrice and was quite pleased all the three times. However my most recent visit was a little disappointing because I found all the chicken items a tad higher on salt content. From the chicken wings in soya sauce to chicken pakora, the chicken items were very salty. My friends also felt the same. 

The food quantity is pretty good.  A normal maincouse serves two people easily. The meinfoon served by Kimli is extremely fine and of high quality. The best bit about visiting this place is the fact that it is pocket friendly.

 The only complain that I have had during all my three visits is with the restaurant shift. They for some reason keep the main restaurant closed and serve in an adjoined semi-house-semi-room place. 

However, I found this place empty during Christmas and Durga Pujo which was unexpected. Thus I enjoyed a wonderful meal without having to wait for hours. One must visit this place and try the lamb items for the excellent taste. I would however suggest you to avoid all chicken items.

I used to go there often back in 2010-2011 since my office was there. Every time there was an occasion Kimli was the place where we used to celebrate. Pocket friendly small outlet, many would not expect a that small an outlet to produce yummy Chinese delicacies but yum is the word for their variety of dishes. I still remember the last time I have had their burnt garlic fried rice. The dish itself was so good that one would not need a side dish to go with. I would love to there again someday.

As I was feeling incredibly cold, I decided to go for a meal at Kimli. Of course, the original shop is closed, probably for renovation, and the restaurant has shifted next door. I was there with a friend, and we decided to order a few things as soon as we entered. My friend wanted Chimney Soup, I wanted Fried Pepper Chicken, and we decided to split a fried rice between us. The restaurant was unremarkable but mostly empty when we entered. As soon as we were seated, though, it started to get filled in. Our order took about some time. The first in was the fried pepper chicken - around 12 pieces of boneless chicken deep fried in batter and served with a lemon wedge. Tasty! The Chimney Soup was light, with flecks of fish, prawns, crab and chicken along with glass noodles, Chinese mushrooms, chopped vegetables in a lovely broth. Every mouthful, accompanied by the terrific green chilli sauce, was brilliant and the portion size was simply huge, big enough for four people (And only two of us were eating, so we packed some for home). We had to ask for our fried rice, and it came. It was perfectly tossed, light, and a sprinkling of soy sauce and vinegar soaked chillies made the world a better place. Our bill was 571/- and we loved every bit of it.  The service can be more attentive, otherwise, great!Update: The photos are from my recent trip there, where I had the following - Chicken lollypop (both spicy and plain), crab claws in chilli, crab claws in teriyaki, chilli garlic pepper chicken, chimney soup, chicken mushroom soup, shredded lamb, honey chicken, ginger chicken, and well, plenty more. You may salivate at the gluttony.

Food: Average! The hakka noodles were thick, oily and absolutely ordinary to taste! The Hunan Chicken was nothing great and it smelled of poke oil!! The Chicken Fried Rice was good enough but the rice wasnt a Basmati one. Schezwan Chicken was strictly Okay and the Green Chilli Paneer tasted better than the rest.

Service: People serving the dishes were too grumpy! (I have no idea why!). They didnt even suggest us any dish and not even bothered to ask us whether they would serve the food or not!

Ambience: Nothing great! Wasnt feeling like we were in a restaurant!

Price: It costed 1333 for 6 people so it's quite affordable. 

My suggestions: Do not visit this place if you have other choices on your list ! The Chinese food served here is nothing great! This was my first visit to Kimli and I was disappointed!

When you are in love with idea of Chinese food, you will meet a way to define your priorities. I found a new way to relish my taste. So I and my friend took a little adventure trip to find out this diner, though we came across this diner with ease. After getting the proper address we stumped over to get the right entrance. But a mighty arrow led us to our destination. 

Milieu- 
Nahhhhhhhhh, not an eye-catcher. This diner adjusted a good amount of space, where move around easily. But bright lights and ‚Äòno decoration look‚Äô does not reflection Chini culture. There is no decor on which you can slip off your heart. It does not excite me, but this story has a lovely twist in it. 

Came, saw and conquered- 
We placed our bets on Singapore Mixed Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken (was attracted by its nameÔÅä). And we abided time, and God had mercy on us. The food arrived at our table, both courses looked dazed As our eyes fulfilled their part of hunger, we took our first gulp. And we just lost in taste, the noodle was evenly spicy and balanced, you could not ask more to produce. But there no generous amount of chicken and prawns you would find, but you will survive the stroke. 11 pieces of chicken were swimming in the flavorful gravy which made my mouth water. But I felt chicken in gravy was giving a slightly rubbery feeling. 

The service was very prompt, but the waiter who has attended failed to give us suggestions, and is not replying any of our queries properly unfortunately. But who cares about that little part when you chewing savory food. If want to taste good Chinese food in a pocket friendly manner, this place will come on your list.

I went back to Kimli after a very long time the previous week. And surprise surprise Kimli has finally expanded and put in a few extra tables! The new place is just round the corner from the old Kimli and it still looks more of a resident than a restaurant but I am sure they are going to deck up the place in the coming weeks. Fingers crossed!
The food in Kimli hasn't changed and as always it is tasty and wholesome. We ordered chicken wantons, egg mein foon, chicken bamboo shoot, knacks kicw lamb, prawn teriyaki and fish in red pepper sauce. 
The chicken wantons were well made, not too doughy and quite fresh. The chicken bamboo shoot is a very clever and different dish and if you like your chicken in white sauce then you should definitely try this! The knacks kicw lamb according to me is the best lamb dish on offer at Kimli and I make it a point to order this whenever I drop in. The fish in red sauce was nice and spicy though the fish could have been a lot more fresh.
But I was really disappointed with the mein foon that they served! What was served was plain noodles and NOT mein foon! It was neither glassy thin nor did it taste of being made of rice. Very disappointing.
The tiger prawn dishes give a winner in terms of money. They serve you 10 prawns for 350 odd bucks! Wow! The prawn teriyaki that we ordered had an excellent sauce but the prawns were so thickly covered with batter that the taste did not shine through. They would do much better not to give the batter! Also we found a few shells in the prawns still there. That was really irritating.
So overall Kimli is still the place to go to for a good wholesome tasty meal of chinese.

P.S. All the dishes mentioned above cost 1500 odd and fed 7 people! Happy pockets!!!



----- 31 May, 2013 -----

The MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT of this place is its lack of space! Chances are you would have to wait for 30 to 40 minutes before you get a table here and even then you feel cramped and pushed into!
This place provides good Chinese food at good pocket friendly prices. And their portions are very substantial (2 plates of fried rice would be more than enough for 3 starving 20 yr old men). Also you get perhaps the cheapest Lamb and Duck dishes in Kolkata here.
If you go here do try the Crab Claw dishes. And believe it or not the chicken lover that i am i have never tasted chicken in all the times i have been here. I have been simply too busy with the lamb, duck etc.. 
My pick for the lamb dishes would be the Kacns Kicw. And don't miss the Duck Teriyaki. 
A highly recommended place for the Chinese loving Kolkatans if you are prepared to wait for your food.

Living in the heart of Golpark, the eating options are no doubt far and wide. Though every place has it own pros and cons, yet for some reason I step into Kimli more often than others. Sometimes after a high doze of window shopping, or  to find a quiet little corner of gossip with a near one  or  even  at other times, to get out of the regular bong platter at home, the reasons can be as different and similar as possible. 
Kimli is not a hyped joint that one would suggest if a tourist visiting Kolkata wants to relish  Chinese cuisine at its best in the city. It is a neat, simple and warm place to begin with. Even a few months back, the restaurant was housed inside a tiny room which had around five tables with very little light  and humble wall posters as it d√©cor. Probably it is the dim lights which made it warm and cozy. Recently, it has shifted to a nearby large spacious area (looks like a dining hall of a  traditional Bengali house) with umpteen floor space and enough lights to stand and stare. Ofcourse, I would say that the place no longer possesses its charm of whispering warmth to enjoy with food. 
Coming to the key point, Kimli serves food in wholesome quantities. The preparations are made with care and caution. On my recent visit, I took sumptuous bites from Spl.Szechwan Duck, Crispy Konjea Lamb with Egg Fried Rice. Generally, when I order  two non-veg dishes, I opt for a veg egg noodles/ rice or sometimes even plain rice to balance the flavours and enjoy the non-veg courses in its full delight. Otherwise, with non-veg noodles/ rice, I feel the entire menu gets a little overbearing with chicken, lamb, fish, duck, prawns fighting for superiority. The duck was well cooked with its meat soft enough to untangle from its bones without much effort. The lamb was crisp and interestingly spiced to give it a hot and juicy texture.
From my earlier experiences, I would say that pan fried momos at Kimli is a must try and if one is fond of sea food, then one can opt for crab soup which is quite a variant from most other menu cards of similar stature food joints. It is a frequent hop-in hop out place for me as the prices are reasonable and one does not have to think too hard for fear of over expenditure.

Firstly let me clarify that the 4.0 rating is for the food alone. It is just another Indianized Chinese restaurant of Kolkata but just like any other Chinese restaurant it has its own distinctive flavours. The place is quite ordinary and so is the decor. The service is quite efficient and nothing fancy but normally there is nothing really one can complain about. The best and most important part is the food. The food here is great to put it very simply. They have quite a substantial variety here and that is something that confuses me each and every time I go there or order from there. But it is a good thing, to be spoilt for choice. At least as far as I am concerned. One very unique item on their menu is duck. Yes you read that right. DUCK. They have more variety in duck preparations than some of the big and popular Chinese restaurants in town. I have tried almost all of them and each of them are quite unique. Duck meat can be a bit stiff sometimes but that is acceptable as they cook it really well here. The only other place serving duck like this is probably Hatari. I have been to Kimli many a times and will keep going back as long as they produce such great food. Don't you miss this quaint little joint. Oh and yes it is also quite generous with the portions therefore the value one gets for the money is right up there.

I cannot believe that I had never been to Kimli before. It is at the end of the same lane were Golpark Bedwin in situated.

On Christmas Eve my friends took me there for dinner. We ordered the Chimney Soup and I was floored. It was just oh so good. A host of vegetables and seafood(including crabmeat)interspersed with rice noodles floating in a light flavourful broth.Along with  the Chimney soup we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Red Pepper Chilly Garlic Fish and Pepper Garlic Chicken. After the Chimney soup all three of us were too full and were discussing amongst each other how we will just have one spoon of the rice to taste and parcel the rest home. After tasting one spoon of that rice, the rest were instantly decimated along with the fish and chicken. The food was that good.The bill came to about 750 for three and was more than reasonable.

There is nothing much to say about the decor. It is just a room and they had decorated the place with strings and balloons for Christmas. The service was cordial and prompt. Also we were the last people to leave. I appreciate that they did not hurry us at the end to get out like a few restaurants tend to do.

Awesome food. The ambience is also good. But the place before renovation was well suited to the style of food and the name. Now, its a normal restaurant. But the waiters are still very humble and well mannered. 
Everything in this restaurant tastes great. But, i donno why, the stomach gets full pretty soon here. So, beware. I would advice to order less initially, and then see for yourself if you need more.
Overall, a great experience every time.

a personal favourite of mine.... though i am a north kolkata resident but a big fan of kimli.... the ambience is really peacefull and the dishes are mouth watering and there value for money..... especially the duck dishes are superb and comes at a low rate with negligible compromise on taste as compared to its contemporaries in and around tangra....
chillyduck  is one of its usp .... the duck meat offered are not only tasty but also tender and a treat to the tastebuds.....
duck teriyarki is also very good.....
u can also try momos out here one of the best momos in kolkata.....
its really pocket friendly..... u get duck dishes 50 rupees cheaper atleast..... so if you are a real foodie kimli will satisfy all your needs.....

Over the years Kimli has created a solid fan following for itself. I love to read and often go to browse the old book shops in the area that is how I chanced upon Kimli eons back ... if your looking for great ambiance don't bother but if you want desi - chinese khana at pocket friendly prices its a good option. Personally I don't care too much for duck meat so I have never sampled the famed duck dishes of Kimli .... however I can certainly recommend the American Chopsuey , Chicken Hakka Noodles , Chili Garlic Chicken , Chicken Wanton and Pepper Prawns all of which are pretty good. Helpings are generous and prices are very fair. Drop by if your in the area but remember they only have half a dozen tables so you would probably have to wait (I usually order a take-away) .

Kimli is one of the best things to have happened to South Kolkata. With a wide range of Chinese dishes on the menu, Kimli is certainly on the list of my favorite restaurants. The best part about Kimli is their prices and the quantities of the dishes. I have found the dishes to be quite well cooked every time I've visited Kimli. The striking feature of this restaurant is the ambiance. It provides a good, peaceful atmosphere which is a big YES for any restaurant. My only 'grievance' regarding Kimli is that the space is a little small, provided the crowd that this restaurant pulls. But then again, smaller the place, better the atmosphere. Anyway, I'll give a two thumbs up to anyone seeking a recommendation about Kimli.

This is one of my favorite places for takeout and I really like all the items here. Given the constrained space within the restaurant had inhibited me from trying this out. However I overcame that and had a wonderful dinner few days back. The quantity of food is what amazes me and I hope they keep it the same. Some of the gravy items have a coating which has deteriorated a little and I would recommend them to keep it to a minimum. The lamb and duck are one of the best in South Kolkata and I would request fellow readers who love these to come here and try it out. We spend a lot of time on chicken and fish so giving some attention to their friends would be welcome considering the way they are presented here :). One point of contention is the wait time but given the quality of food, it is worth it.

Great Chinese food at a very affordable rate. The starters are too good especially the chilli garlic red pepper chicken. I would suggest not to order prawns cause its not really their thing. The Mei Foon noodles is one of a kind. Its totally amazing. The Teriyaki Chicken is another favourite of mine. Just love the gravy. Its not really a grand place but if you are planning on a cozy dinner with a loved one then this is the place to go.

This place has seriously gone to the dogs. It used to be nice but now they let the waiters run this place and they are the worst thing that could happen to Kimli. We were shopping around in Gariahat and as it was nearly 3, we thought we'd just got for some soup and lollypops. In the last 4-5 occasions, whenever we asked for lollypops, the waiters said not available but I heard them taking order over the phone. So when we entered, asked the manager whether lollypops are available and he said 'yes'. But when we ordered, the waiter just rudely said 'hobe na'. This has happened so many times now, that I am sick of this place. I don't know why management doesn't care, but they should take not of their errant servers. Never have I seen a more un-courteous and rude waiters! On top of that, their food has also become
just as bad. The portions are tiny, the chicken is stiff and stale-smelling and the duck now looks like mummified bits of meat that has been battered and fried. I admit that duck here has always been too bony to be good, now it is positively scary.

I don't know who else has faced this, but I certainly am not visiting this awful restaurant ever again. I'd rather pay up a 100 more rupees than stand their unpleasant behaviour and substandard food.

Last night 3 of us went at this fine eatery located very close to Gariahat Crossing. We ordered Peeper Chicken as starter, which was a plate full of 12 solid meat balls decent in taste. Then in our main course we ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Mei Foon ( Rice Noodles), Hot Garlic Lamb & Teriyaki Fish. All the dishes were tasty and contained good amount of stuffs. Still Mixed Mei Foon was superb as it contained gamuts of shreded chicken & prawns. Teriyaki Fish was also great as d pieces were well cooked & were very soft. Though d place was small (only 20 people could be accommodated) but d ambience was also nice. Service was prompt. Price tag was also very pocket friendly. I would love to recommend this dine in restaurant to others.

all dishes taste very good and different. loved their noodles. Located on an almost quiet street in Gariahat. Very cosy sitting at the ground floor. They also got tables on the terrace which is roofed but open on sides. Dining on the terrace is very enjoyable. Reasonable pricing. Nice shaded waiting area. Tasted lamb there and it was good. The cosiness at the ground floor may not be appealing to many

I ate a lot here and didn't spend a penny. So I love Kimli, and I love my roomie, for his treat it was! :) 

My roomie owed me a lunch. Being people on a budget, we shortlisted a few restaurants, ones that we hadn't visited and finally decided on Kimli. First, it was close to our home in Ballygunge. Second, who can resist the temptation of Teriyaki Duck? ;)

Thanks to fellow foodies on Zomato, we knew they had shifted to the ground floor of a nearby house temporarily, as the original place was being revamped. For those who need direction, it's in the alley near Golpark, the one with the old book-stalls and Bedwin. As we reached, the place was half-full, and we took our table. The place is okay, but as I said, it's temporary, so point talking much about it.

As we were going through the menu, it was surprising to see so many items there. I wonder how they make so many different cuisines, different dishes! The spread was huge, from Chicken to Crab to Lamb to Duck. And the names! Had no clue what half of them were, which made it even more tempting! Thankfully we knew what we wanted to order. Teriyaki Duck, which I wouldn't miss for the world, given my fondness for Japanese food, along with Mixed Fried Rice. FYI, the waiters know their sauces well, do not hesitate to ask for suggestions. They are extremely polite as well, which is a big plus in my book.

It was 15 minutes when the food was brought from the old kitchen. The quantity was tremendous. It'd easily feed two people (not if one of them is my roomie, who is worse than Joey when it comes to food :P). The Teriyaki looked great, while 8 pieces of duck was more than I'd expected for 155 bucks! We dug in. Having never had duck before, I had no parameter to judge it upon. It tasted great, and suit my palate like anything, but I think it was more of an Indian version of the Teriyaki. The duck was boiled alright, but it wasn't grilled properly, and the Teriyaki sauce lacked the darkness and flavor or Soy. The duck tasted amazing, perfectly moist and spiced. Having not seen many restaurants offering duck, that too in such price, it's a steal! And this gives Kimli a competitive edge over other joints. The rice tasted average, and I wish I'd rather gone for noodles.

Well, everything is going for this place. The wide spread of cuisines, the delectable food, Lamb, Duck and Bhetki at such amazing prices, Kimli is a total winner! When I think about value for money, this place is quite up there with Blue Poppy! You gotta visit this place. As for me, Crab Claw Soup, Shredded Lamb, Bhetki and Duck in Black Bean Sauce is calling me out! :P Going back soon!

Great food in great quality and quantity... Highly recommendable... And most important is that the menu is huge. You will have loads to choose from. True that its difficult to get a table during peak hours but don't worry, the security guard will arrange chairs for you to wait outside. Loved the ambiance. Service is great too. 9/10 for food.

Recently, Kolkata has been thunderously attacked by multiple depression led downpours and while the city was busy soaking in the dampness, we were out to enjoy the weather over movies, gossip and (of course) food! So, after a show of The Conjuring, we unanimously decided to fulfill our months-old plan of having duck at Kimli.

When we arrived in front of the restaurant at the corner of a bending alley in Hindustan Park, a signboard greeted us that said Kimli has been shifted to the adjacent building due to restoration of the original one. The good news is; Kimli is going to be stripped out of its space crunch. The not-so-good news; the menu has already been revised with higher prices.
Now, about the decor, I cannot say much as it was only a temporary hub. But, the spacious hall like room with more than 10 tables surely looked like an udippi restaurant.

A polite server brought in the menu cards and we straight away ordered for Duck Teriyaki (gravy) and Chicken Egg Hakka Noodles. When the food made its appearance after some good 15 minutes, we almost gaped at the huge quantity!

Although we adored the simple and flavoursome hakka noodles filled with shredded chicken, egg and veggies, we somewhat had to struggle to finish the bowl of Duck Teriyaki at the end. 
Teriyaki is a Japanese preparation where the meat is supposed to be grilled after being marinated in soy sauce; there was a lot of soy sauce but the whole grill factor was missing. The slices of duck meat fried with a thin coating of a spicy red batter, was quite succulent and crisp (I actually found the coating yummier than the meat itself!).
With great effort we wiped off the 8 slices of duck meat with the noodles but had to give the sauce laden gravy a miss.

It was my first visit to Kimli, which was quite okay. Overall, the quantity dominated over the quality and taste.  Anyhow, I'd love to try out other items from Kimli and revisit the revamped restaurant soon.

i have visited this restaurant number of times.. it is located in gariahat... nice place... the decoration of kilmi is good and food is awesome... i have tried mixed hakka noddles, chicken thai noddles, singapore noddles, black bean sauce chicken, thai chicken, spicy red sauce chicken, szechuan chicken, fried spring, fried pepper, szechuan duck, golden fish, sweet & sour szechuan style prawns, hong kong chicken, chicken fried wanton... all dishes were superb... ¬†you should try  'thai chicken'.. one plate is enough for two person.. the ambiance is really peaceful.. price is affordable. it will not burn your pocket... staffs are very helpful and service is fast... kimli is one of my favorite restaurant.. the best chinese restaurant in south kolkata...

visited the place 7 to 8 times now.. and now it has become the ultimate dining place for us. if we have to look for quality food , our end option is kimli. my personal favorite is sweet corn crab soup. i prefer lamb, but I'm not sure whether they provide lamb or mutton. kungpao chicken rocks. and if you have enough time please try the chimney soup. avoid the Tomyum soup here. overall it's a good place

this little chinese joint located at a quiet corner of gariahat,with minimal interiors and comfortness, serves tasty indianised- chinese recipes at moderate prices.
i am a complete fan of their american choupsey! a highly recommendable one,and the price is so less.
any noodles and rice dish is served with humongous amount of meat, comes in a good quantity for 2.
i tasted the kanc kiwk once, the taste was nice,but i particularly didnot like it because,i found the mutton kind-of smell,i doubt it was lamb! so beware,if u dont like chinese mutton recipes,opt for chicken to be on the safer side.
their main attraction is duck,but i cant comment as i never had that.
the waiters are quite active,the service time is average, and the prices are excluding vat.
overall, kimli stands as a nice chinese budget restaurant, and my recommendation goes in favour of their american chopsuey.

Visited the place on Sunday with a few guests to treat them to a good Chinese lunch. Started off quite well with the Chimney Soup and Red pepper garlic chicken which were really well-cooked. Next we ordered Special Green Fried Rice and Teriyaki Duck. The Fried Rice was a real shock! ............ The rice was far from the fine varieties used for Fried Rice, as thick as "puffed rice" ......moreover, the rice-grains were not washed properly and the entire preparation tasted horrible ............ we could not even enjoy the Duck as our mood was already spoiled by the Rice............... really disappointed as I  had visited the place based on good reviews on Zomato

recently  i visited this place. its situated near gariahath but away from the hustle bustle of the market. 
as we entered the restaurant we were cordialy greeted by the staff. we expected a almost empty restaurant as it is situated on a deserted road but to our surprise it was packed up and there was only one table left empty. 
the interiors are ordinary, only painted and a piece of false ceiling is used for the decoration.   we were again surprised as their menu card consisted of a lot of variety ,starting from soups to wanton with variety of mei foon ,chopsuey,crab,duck,lamb,chicken,prawn etc. the menu was really vast and when asked,the waiter told me that every thing in the menu card is available. the waiter was quite informed about the food and we ordered 

1.american chopsuey 
2.kacns kicw
3. veg special green hakka .

they took a reasonable time of ten to 15 mins to serve and wao the quantity of the items were ample to feed 4 people. infact we (2) were full after having the chopsuey only. specialy the noodles,it had so bouffant quantity that ultimately we had to left a small part of it.
all these 3 dishes were very elegantly and aestheticaly coocked, rightfuly spiced. 
i will give them a 4.5 for food and service and deduct 0.5 because the kacns kicw had the typical smell of mutton and some pieces of fat.
overall it is a definite recommendation .

Cheap and tasty food. Really a great place to eat when you're on a tight budget.
Love their Teryaki Duck.
Although the new outlet has a very depressing look to it. Seating is quite uncomfortable too.
However I would still recommend this place for sheer value for money.

This place is  at a walkable distance from my home,so preferred place for take -aways.Its small ,old fashioned and always bustling so I really avoid dine in.

Coming to food.They have lot to offer from lamb,duck crab ,fish everything..
The taste and quantity  is good and pocket friendly too.

My personal favourtites would be the chopsueys both American and Chinese.

Both the  hakka and Cantonese nooddles,Kung Pao chicken(very well made with cashews),Chilli Garlic Chicken and many more.

A Value for money indeed!!!!

This small restaurant in its quaint red brick building is situated in a posh neighborhood with a calm & quite atmosphere and empty leaf strewn streets. It's a nice peaceful feeling that you have sitting outside on the chairs waiting for your turn to enter. With only 5 tables and a soaring popularity in recent months, the wait is unavoidable and more than often long. Getting there is no problem since it's only a stone's throw away from Golpark at Purna Das Road. Its at the end of the side road which starts from the front of Bedwin eatery.

Moving inside the atmosphere turns heavy with scents of spicy oriental dishes. Though the space is a bit cramped, the minimal oriental decor and comfortable setting makes for a pleasurable experience. The place is a hit with family crowds. Service is fairly quick and the waiters are polite.

The menu is huuge. It ranges from Chicken, Lamb, Crab, Fish and Duck to Vegetable dishes as well as soups, noodles, seafood and wanton. The cuisine is a mixture of dishes from South East Asian countries with emphasis on Chinese. The Indian elements are present in the Fish section and the soups have a number of Tibetan names. Overall, it'll be a fun adventure for you to order. The price across the menu is very aggreable except for a few sections such as the Tiger Prawns under the crab menu and few chinese specialty soups. While choosing, I's suggest ditching the Veggies, the fish and the wanton, and going for the more exotic. Especially because this is 1 of the few places in the city where you can taste such dishes at such prices.

I had heard of the specialty Kimli holds as far as Duck dishes are concerned and therefore decided to try it. The Duck in Black Bean Sauce was according to me gratifying. *Now let's get this clear*. I, like most among us had never had duck before. I myself had never had it before or since. So I may be wrong to judge the dish they served. But I felt that the meat could've been a bit more soft. The black bean sauce wasn't agreeing with the dish in the first place and the spices were explosive. The result was a medley of taste that refused any of the particular flavours to seep through. The overall effect, though nice in a general way was way below what I expected.
 The Chicken Hakka Chowmein which came next was far more satisfying, both in it's familiarity as well as taste.

Chakraborty Tip : Located nearby is the Golpark used book store neighborhood. You may have the pleasure of browsing through a few of them like I did, after your meal. :)

I was aware of the existence of Kimli right from my college days, but got the opportunity to try it out very recently. And when I did, I was like ... why dint I come here before ?! 

Tucked away in one of the by lanes of Purna Das Road near Golpark, the restaurant is situated right in front of the PC Chandra outlet. 

The Ambiance: The interiors are nothing to write home about. The place is pretty small with few tables to accommodate around 20 odd people. 

The Food: This restaurant offers the best possible combination of great food and value for money! Where else will you find a plate of Pure Bhetki Chinese starters @ Rs 130 and that too 10 pieces ! Or Tiger prawns @ Rs 350. I have dined here twice and both the times the experience was more than satisfactory. The Teriyaki Duck is a must try. Though I am not a big fan of duck but I would try this again. Also the fish items are pure Bhetki which I absolutely recommend! The mixed rice is very average and I liked the noodles better.

The service : The service is prompt and nothing to complain about.

Conclusion: I have absolutely no complaints about this Chinese joint. Yes I agree it serves Indianised version of Chinese food but it tastes real good :). This is a perfect place for a quick snack or even treating your friends and it is easy on the pocket. A meal for two would not be more than Rs. 400

A really tiny eatery just off Golpark, where the food really makes up for the lack of space. Do visit Kimli for a laid back, lip-smacking and delicious Chinese lunch. the place is small, and there's barely place to cram yourself in, while the service is often erratic and the food takes a tad too long to arrive, but don't let these be deterrents, there's still enough place for a great conversation with friends. When eating at Kimli, it's best to go for dishes that sound a little uncommon. Turn back the pages of the menu card, and go for the Chicken Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Lollipop, the sweetish taste of the chicken lollipops are beautiful contrasted with a hint of garlic, and green chillis, which make for a wonderful combo. You can also try out the crab claws in Teriyaki sauce. The meat is always fresh, and cooked to perfection, without being too spicy or oily. In the mains, the Chicken in Rice wine is mild and soothing on the palate, as is the Hunan Chicken. I would recommend not going for the lamb dishes, as most of the time, it's actually mutton disguised as lamb, and the dishes still taste great! It also does a wonderful Duck preparations, especially the Chilly Duck. 
The best thing about Kimli, undoubtedly, are the the serving portions. It's easy, home-style Chinese food served in huge portions, usually ten pieces of chicken in the dish, good enough to feed two. If you want to lunch out with friends, Kimli comes highly recommended.

Chinese Food is unique in its own way and hence 100 people can cook it in 100 ways. Out of them, very few actually succeeds in cooking them perfectly.
Even though, this Restaurant may not be a super brand or a big chain, but the quality and taste of Chinese Food is definitely ONE OF THE BEST in the city. My words may sound too unrealistic, but a visit here shall make you echo the same sentiment.
Green Chilly Chicken is a must try here.

Kimli, the very name brings back memories of college life when after college, a few of us would be famished and willing to eat anything in sight. We would check our wallets and rush to Gariahat to dutch-in and eat Momo and Tom Yum soup. Yes those were great days and Kimli made it all the more memorable.

Good food, good service and price that is easy on the pocket makes Kimli an all time favourite. If you are visiting for the first time, you must try out the Special Teriyaki Duck. Its yummy and an all time favourite. Try it along with the Chimney soup or the Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. For the main course you should try the Special Green Fried Rice, the Chicken in Black Bean Sauce, Sweet and Sour Szech Style Prawn.

The place is small and you might not get a table readily, but you need not wait for very long and once you get a table, the food will be on your table pretty quick.

Kim Li is a small restaurant tucked away in a lane near Hindusthan Park. First of all I wouldn't recommend eating at this restaurant, simply because the place is too small and the ambience is extremely average. It's always better to order on the phone and just collect the food later.

Coming to the food, the quality is decent and the prices are fairly reasonable. Kim Li is known for its duck dishes, so one should definitely try them. The rice is also very tasty, the Kim Li Special Fried Rice is a personal favourite. Most of the chicken dishes are fairly decent, I really like the chicken in black bean sauce. The lamb dishes are also excellent at very reasonable prices, should definitely try their Chilli/hot garlic/shredded lamb  However, one should never order prawn from this place, big let down. 

Pro's

1. Affordable prices
2. Good quality food
3. Great location

Con's

1. Extremely average ambience
2. Home delivery service is almost never available
3. The prawn dishes are a let down more often than not

Bengali Chinese. 
Food is nothing extraordinary. And the behavior of the staff is far from courteous. Rude and uninterested. Why on earth should I be going to such a restaurant which neither offers good food, nor is friendly. Give them a phone call and see for yourself.

If I am at all having Chinese food at a South Calcutta haunt, I would rather go to Mandarin or Hatari or even Kim Ling in Deshpriyo Park, which is still run by the evergreen Chinese gentleman in his eighties. 

For real Chinese food, go to Tung Nam in Chhattawala Gali, one of the oldest surviving Chinese restaurants in the old China Town of Central Calcutta.

Went at this small eatery yesterday with my mom. I had called at this place before hand to make sure that duck was available. This restaurant is located near goal park opposite P.C. Chandra Jewellery. The first thing that I noticed was all the seats except one was occupied. I went there almost 2pm so it means that it is a popular restaurant. I ordered one mixed fried rice and one duck special chilli (I had ordered duck chilli but I didn't know they served special duck chilli and I have no idea what made it "special") and 2 thumbs up (again I had ordered coke but I was insisted thumbs up since the waiter jotted it wrong). This was my first time to try duck and I really liked what I ate. There were bones but they were too crispy. The duck was very tender and yummy. Me and my mom could not finish the mixed fried rice which was also cooked nicely. So it would be right to say that there quantity is pretty good. The food was fresh and piping hot. The air condition was not running properly and so we were perspiring much. This made us a little uncomfortable to enjoy the food wholeheartedly. The seats are also a little congested. But over all the food is good and the rates are pocket friendly. I am really looking forward to visit this place soon and try their other items.

Staying in tangra has always kept me away from Chinese restaurants far off,given i get the entire China town at a walkable distance. Anyway after loads of requests from friends,i decided to accompany them to this place. This is a small Chinese eatery located near Hindustan park having 3 six seater tables and 3 four seaters. The atmosphere is just okay,nothing to write about. Coming to the food,my friends recommended teriyaki duck with chicken rice noodles,and i just gave in. Believe me foodies the duck preparation was out of the world. There were bones but it was crisp,the flesh was quite tender unlike the common belief about duck and the teriyaki coating was way too good! And the price,one plate of duck with 8 pieces was 135 only. Some other renowned restaurants serve duck at over 200rupees,so that's the best deal. if not for anything else,i am definitely gonna revisit for the duck preps!

What I like about Kimli is the food and a homely atmosphere. It is pretty pocket friendly too. But despite of being cheap the quality and quantity of food they serve is really good. The problem about the restaurant is its small space. In a busy hour you may have to queue up in the street in front of the restaurant. The decor is average but  the overall ambiance is good.

Among the restaurants I have been to till now, this is the only place where spicy means spicy and not sweet. Schezwan chicken may make you feel like a dragon.
Lamb and Duck preparations are the cheapest here. But the dishes are awesome.

A group of 13 people ate here sometime ago and yet the bill came to only Rs.1800.

The only negative point is the lack of space.

Kimli is either a very old brand or it has come in to replace another restaurant cannot remember everything about this from my childhood. I have had food out here but then we forgot with better brands around until a birthday party of my cousin brought me here some 3-4 months back. Since then have visited this place maybe 4-5 times. 

The negatives first cause the positives are too many:
Firstly, it is a very small sized eatery, secondly it is always filled with people and too much noise, third the decor is not splendid but acceptable, fourthly I feel that maybe you can exchange the plastic cushioned chairs for better ones fifthly only today for the first time I felt the A.C. needed servicing since two 1.5 ton split A.C. not enough to make the place cool enough and the extra spicy food we ordered made us more uncomfortable. 
Now the justification for all this. Imagine having the best food at damn cheap prices, can you really complain about the seating or the decor or does it really matter if decor is your first priority and you ready to go spend more than double just for better decor or seating then go somewhere else.

The food is yummilicious and so awesome I could live on it everyday and the good thing about them is that they do not compromise with quality. One of the best places to try out fish, duck and lamb. Imagine you are having one of the best American Chopsuey at just Rs.105 or Bhetki at Rs.120 or 130 and all with good quantity. The quantity is so much that 4 foodies could finish two main dish and three side dish with considerable effort. I cannot make a suggestion out here as nearly everything they serve is so very good. From duck do try Chilli Duck or special Teriyaki or try something from lamb depending on the sauce you want as the waiters know their food well. 

One thing to note was that today we wanted another dish and the kitchen had closed down but just for us on a request they asked the cook who was leaving to stay back and make the dish due to a slight misunderstanding where we were not told it was the last order. However what came was very good. We found the pineapple slightly stale and smelly but we were so pleased with the fact that they gave us the dish which was a life saver after so much spicy and fiery hot dishes that we had ordered that I felt it a shame to complain for that small bit.
Always liked their food and they make it worth every inch you spend...Go there and enjoy.

Of course it is a bit Indianised Chinese but it is very good and just could not give it a 5 because the decor or the seats are not that enjoyable. Finally a 5 for value for money and a 4.5 for an overall dining experience.

TASTY FOOD AT POCKET FRIENDLY PRICES!

If you are looking for affordable and decent Chinese food head straight to Kimli. It situated in a small lane near Hindustan Park. their prices are low but portions are big. The setting is standard for a small chinese restaurant with paper lanterns hanging all around which only adds to the charm of the restaurant.
 
The restaurant is famous for its Chilli Duck dish really is a complete dish. It is well prepared and the meat is tender and goes well with their noodles, especially their Cantonese noodles or Chopsuey. The noodles complement the flavours of the duck. 

Other items to be had here are their Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Prawn and Kung pao Chicken. They make some of the spiciest schezwan dishes I have eaten in a while, and these are not meant for the faint hearted!

The right choice of sauces can also make or break a restaurant. With Kimli, the establishment has ticked all the right boxes. 

Despite their space crunch, the service is always prompt and efficient. The servers are friendly and well mannered. They are also ready to tweak their dishes to suit a diner's needs.

Kimli sounds a lot like Kimling (the famous Chinatown restaurant) but falls short when it comes to food quality. Still this is a decent restaurant, the USP being the price. Decent Chinese dishes offered at reasonable prices. Location is a big plus point. 

This place is not roomy, with only a few tables. Nice place to eat out with friends.

Food: 3/5

Awesome delicious chinese food with reasonable pricing and decent ambience what else can you ask for. This place has a perfect blend of all of the above mentioned. Though the place is small but seriously who cares if you get treated like a king or queen here. I love their food its absolutely mouth-watering I promise. Their babycorn, momos, noodles, fried rice everything is scrumptious. Yes I agree the ambience needs to improve but gradually I guess as it grows the owners will take care of it. If you love chinese you can't miss this one guys it will not disappoint you I'm sure. 
So I will give it 4.5 and now its your turn to visit and rate.

Like Chinese food? Not willing to pay hand over fist for it? Kimli is the place to be. 
Small, unassuming little place tucked away in a lane right off Gol Park, it might have been one of those dime a dozen Bangali-Chinese places Kolkata is famous for, but their food says otherwise. 
The Chilli Duck really packs a punch - the meat is succulent and tender and complements their noodles well. I have always been a little wary of the gravy served at your average Chinese restaurants, seeing as most of them are suspiciously identical to taste; not so with Kimli though. Distinct flavours that do not overpower the meat/fish, it was a welcome change from the usual tomato based boring sides available elsewhere. That is not to say their stir fries come up short. Beautifully coated chicken/lamb/duck with just the right amount of stickiness and flavour.
The Schezwan Noodles was wonderful, but not for the fainthearted. I have a soft spot for the humble chili and turn my nose up at what is usually on offer in the name of Chilli - Anything in Chinese restaurants, but not so here. These guys really do mean business.
The Thai Noodles had a certain tartness to it and went well with the Duck.
I believe one can identify a good Chinese place by their choice of sauces, and once again, Kimli hits all the right buttons: A piquant green chilli chutney that is sweet and tart at the same time, with the heat sneaking up on you much later; a tomato-garlic chutney that adds the right kind of sweetness to the Schezwan Noodles; and vinegar-ed chilli bits. Perfection.
Service is prompt, although the place might be a little cramped during rush-hour (read: 7pm onwards). Waiters are helpful without being intrusive and are more than willing to tweak your order to accommodate your tastes. 
The color scheme is red and varnished brown - very oriental. The lighting is mellow, and yes, you will come across the paper lantern stereotype, but in all fairness, it only adds to the restaurant's charm. Prices are unbelievably low and portions always enormous! 
The one thing I sorely missed here was the option for Pork. I have been on an eternal quest to locate the best Chilli Pork in the city and finally hoped to here, only they do not have it on their Menu. An urgent request to the owner to include this superior meat, and I will be a very happy customer. Nay, a loyal regular.

Discovered this place one afternoon while deciding on where to have lunch. Was a real pleasant experience. The food was superb so was the service. Definitely worth going. Price wise it was very satisfying as well. 700 bucks for a five course meal for two.

A friend had told me about this small Chinese eatery off Gol Park. I landed up at 9 o clock at night and found quite a few families waiting on the pavement for a seat in the restaurant. Since I was alone, I was lucky that a two seater table was vacant and I was promptly seated.

The menu presented interesting options including some duck dishes. On enquiry the duck dishes were not available. Being alone gets into severe constraints about the number of dishes one can try - so I ordered a Prawn Tom Yum, a non-veg chop suey and chilli garlic chicken.

The food took a longer time compared to what I thought. The Thai soup was tangy with mushrooms and prawns. It was not an authentic preparation but nevertheless went well in a wintery night. The chop suey had overdone on the sauces bit, and was a little bit more spicy than to my liking. The Chilli Garlic Chicken was just awesome, and I feasted on it.

The restaurant which looks congested with barely place to move around is light on the pocket. The service is a tad slow.

Food: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Value For money: 3.5/5

The words " The way to a man's heart is through his stomach " has been proven correct by KIMLI  over and over again. The sumptuous food at such a fantastic price makes KIMLI a must-eat-at by every Calcuttan . It has never compromised on quality or quantity. The only thing I would suggest the owners to work on is the space.

I have tried their food a couple of times and would just say that the food is mediocre.
Apart from the Chicken Cantonese Chowmein and the Fried Chicken Wanton everything I have ever had here was even rejected by my dog when I tried to feed him the left overs I could not eat.

The best chinese restaurant around golpark...Good ambience,Great food but somewhat small and cramped...The service time is also very late...u have to wait a minimum 10-15 minutes to get your food...The food tends to be indo-chinese obviously..But nevertheless its great...The Red pepper chicken,Chilli garlic noodles,Teriyaki chicken,Green hakka chowmein,Cantonese noodles  simply rock...However one negative side of the food is that it tends to be little more oily...About the pocket pinch-Its completely reasonable...Overall a very good place but the main negative side is that since is small,you may find yourself in a long waiting line..

You know you are not in a wrong place when you are waiting outside the restaurant, with three sets of people before you, and two other sets after you at 4 O'clock on a Saturday.

I went into Kimli off a friend's advice on good Chinese in South Calcutta. And, indeed I got to say it's super stuff. I'd probably rate it as the second best no-so-high profile Chinese in South Calcutta. My loyalty is still with Blue Lagoon.

Coming to Kimli. It's at the ground floor of a residential building. It seemed that the owners stay right above. So, a quiet meal is guaranteed. Here is how we rolled.

We ordered Golden (Fried)Chicken and Pepper Prawn. I have a weakness for prawns. The weakness amplified by millions. The prawns were perfectly done on a bed of fried peppers and chilies. The chicken (as Golden Fried usually goes wrong) was very juicy and crispy by the word.

Next came Mixed Gravy Noodles, Duck Teriyaki and Shredded Lamb (Dry). 

The quantity for the Gravy Noodles was fantastic and was meat laden. There was no miserliness there. Duck, as I understood, was their specialty. Large chunks of meat (with bone) was served in a wonderful tasting red teriyaki gravy. It was spicy and nice. The duck meat was tender and properly cooked. It went really well with the noodles. 

Shredded Lamb, however, came as a disappointment. The meat had become tough, and after the second spoonful, I found out that it carried a burnt after taste. Being one of my favourite dishes, I was disappointed. But, next came the goodness of the people at Kimli. On being pointed out that the dish was not good, they immediately took it away and within minutes provided us with a new plate of lamb. It was then I realised that they make the shredded lamb quite well indeed. Most importantly, the meat was tender.

A drawback of the place is that its small. You might just have to wait for a long time at dinner and on weekends. It's dimly lit, but that's what gives it a nice ambience. So, much for two people costed us about 700! That is unbelievable. The staff is friendly and food delivery time, given the rush, was normal.

Their menu is quite unorthodox, with dishes being segregated according to the proffered meat. It's neat and has a whole lot of options!


All in all, a place worth multiple visit.

How can someone ever get enough of the Duck dishes at Kimli? They are by far the Best in town Duck servers. A very cozy place to eat out, dimly lit, soft lights. Service is a little slow but the food is delicious.
The place is really small and cramped which leads to good waiting period at times, specially on occasions. Very pocket friendly.

I was headed for my dinner at hungry tide but did not like their seating so we were walking down to Golpark suddenly I noticed a red board with some lights at the end of the street. Once we reached there was no looking back. We saw people waiting but i still wanted my dinner there, so i patiently waited. We were shown inside a cozy, dim lit restro. The whiff made me feel i'm going to love this place. We ordered chicken tom yum ,sweet corn & chilli fish. The portions were good and the taste was awesome. Although the tom yum did'nt have a strong lemongrass flavour it was very nice. Later for mains the mixed rice & spicy chicken was very satisfying. After that i ate very often there. The lollipop is too good & they give 10 pcs . I love Kimli food. It is not a fine dining but it doesn't burn ur wallet like red hot chilli pepper.

the best place to have authentic Chinese food!!! The best part about the restaurant is the Chinese calendar that is there on every table. It is addicting and I have to read it every time I go there. The fact that it does not sell pork is a blessing in disguise for many. My first choice when I plan to dine Chinese!!!

Tired of fine dining experience? Want to give the ettiquets a miss, yet enjoy nice chinese food on a lazy evening?
Well then take a turn from d hustle n bustle of Gariahat Road and get into Kimli.
Yes the place is small, yet you'd have this cosy feel once you set your foot in the resturant; And the food, ofcourse - "shredded lamb" / "hot garlic pepper chicken" to start with followd by "Thai Meifoon" and "Teriyaki chicken" / "Hunan chicken."
Etherial!

But as we know, behind every source of light, there's darkness -
1. No pork :-(
2. Duck isn't that good

Kimli's speciality is its mouthwatering chinese cuisine as well as momo's,one of my personal favourites.The settings of this restaurant with dim lightings and serene atmosphere makes one enjoy one's privacy in a  homely manner.The service is good, especially its system of home- delivery.The fact that it takes orders for parcels for parties and functions also makes people enjoy their food away from the place itself.

went there today only.......... had only two things......
1. mixed fried rice.........
2. duck with garlic sauce........
firstly about the fried rice, it was good enough for hungry souls as the quantity was good and the taste was also somewhat above average
coming to the the duck....... it was seriously horrible.... the garvy was bad and there was no meat in the duck......... bones were only what we got inside the coating...... overall taste 2.5/5 for the rice and 0.5/5 for the duck..........

If you are looking 4 a gr8 taste at a descent cost, then you must go 2 Kimli.
Though it's a small place, The ambiance is good and the food is yummy!
Pan Fried Momo, Green Hakka Noodles, Lamb Dishes, Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken and Schezwan Chicken are very tasty.
I won't mind going back.

Well Kimli is tucked in a small corner near Golpark.
But however small it may be it attracts me no ends. One of the best Chinese food outlets, this restaurant is a winner when it comes to the pocket pinch yet delivering great quality food. 
A regular at this restaurant I recommend the Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken. 
Also the Green Hakka Noodles are very nice. Also try the Pan Fried Momos, they taste great.
Overall a gr8 plc to be when looking for gr8 quality Chinese food!

I have been here a couple of times since it opened, but never provided a review. 
It has improved greatly over the last couple of years. 
The place, whilst small, has a pretty cozy feel to it. Service is above average. The portions are big and the food tastes good as well. 
Some of the dishes might have too much garlic, but that is easily compensated by the fact that both the taste and flavour are excellent. Most places in the city serve terrible Honey based dishes. This fortunately is among the exceptions. 
The Honey Chicken was absolutely delicious. Well cooked, not overwhelmingly sweet and I could taste the honey too. 
The Hot Garlic Lamb's only drawback was that it was too garlicy. 
The Lamb was perfectly cooked; soft, succulent and juicy. 
Noodles were not brilliant but not bad either. 
Excellent value for money and definitely among the better place to have Chinese from in south Calcutta.

Kim Li is one of this cosy joints I love to keep going back to. My wife and I can never get enough of The Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken and Mixed Cantonese noodles. Unfortunately the place is really small. We try our best to stay away from the tables near the rest rooms! I'd give the place a few more bonus points because of the in-house green chill sauce. If you're looking good value for money chinese food in and around the Golpark-Gariahat area..this is a place you don't want to miss out on!

The food is hot and fresh. Their lamb dishes are the best in Calcutta and also their duck. The food is priced cheap although they have been increasing prices once a month. Every time i ask for green curry they don't have it. I doubt it's much of a Thai place.

Service is fast.

Should add beer though.

Tucked in a quiet corner near Golpark Kimli is a real winner when it comes to dishing out fantastic Chinese fare to the cash strapped college goers. The portions are huge and delicious and doesnot even tax upon your packet. Their prawn szecheuan  , red pepper garlic chicken, cantonese noodles  are must tries.
