Nice place for guys to hang out. Cheap drinks go easy on your pocket. Sad part it closes down before 12 in the night so be there early to enjoy

For years, I have been passing by this outlet but never bothered to enter it. Yesterday, I at last went in with a friend.
It is a small outlet having three sections- one bar, another singing bar and the last dancing bar. We chose the ordinary bar as I felt that singing bar would be too loud for us to talk to each other, while I was not keen on visiting dancing bar.
The waiters are smiling and informal, which I loved. The bar is dimly lit and the tv was on, where, unfortunately , we were made to see the horrible scenes taken from Vivekananda bridge disaster.
For food, we chose chicken drumstick, which were soft and juicy.
And then we chose chicken tandoori. It was awesome. The accompanying chutney was delicious and we could have gulped it whole. 
Overall a nice experience.

A sad place - swiped my debit card, in spite of getting a debit notice from my bankers, they denied payment, and I paid them cash. I have been calling them from Delhi every day, since Nov 30, 2015 to return my money (though a small amount of Rs 870) and they pretend that I am not speaking to the right person. Beware of these cheats.

There were two sections of the restaurant. Since we visited for lunch, it was the lounge which was open. Ambience is pretty ordinary with some pungent smell from the upholstery. Among the orders, the best was the banjara chicken kabab which was really awesome. Hot and sour soup and the noodles were okay. However the chicken tandoori could in no way tickle the taste buds. Service is satisfactory. Price is okay.

This place has a nice ambience and located at a good location, net to the British council. The restaurant has separate lounge and bar. You have to cross the bar to enter the lounge. The lounge is dimly lit with blue leds. Sofas are there for the guests for sitting. 
We order egg fried rice and lemon chicken. Taste of both the dishes were good. One thing a dislike about their serving is that they do not dispose off the lemon seeds from the lemon chicken. While having the gravy I bite one of these lemon seed which totally changed my taste buds in moments.
P.S. A suggestion---> They could increase the quantity of chicken in that price.

Hookah is good. But serving quality is low enough. You need to ask everything that you need. Beer is good. and food also. Rate is comparative low than other.

Best avoided for the normal partygoer. Beer is cheap, was too afraid to try the food.

 Provides a special taste of the Indian singing bar. One may visit at ones personal risk and preference.

excellent bar and restaurant i liked it. i enjoyed tamil songs and south indian songs.the singers are very very decent and simple.its worth just sitting two hours and enjoying the songs. food is good but not up to the standard.no where can listen tamil or telugu songs except this restaurant.i love it and every time if my visit in kolkata sure i will visit this restaurant and have some sea food.

this  restaurant cum bar is located bang  on camac street near ajc bose road crossing , location is  brilliant  but the same cannot be said about ambience & value for money ,  to give  you a  couple  of  examples  , jack daniel's  here would cost you rs 700  / 60 ml peg ,  that is extravagant  according to me  ,  more so when you consider that you can get JD at rs 500/ 60  ml peg elsewhere .  well we had chilly fish dry at rs  200/  plate ,  fish manchurian dry at rs 210/ plate &  szechuan fish at rs 210 /  plate .  in drinks we had   3 fosters beer  at rs 180 / bottle & 1 tuborg beer at rs 145 / bottle .  the total bill came at rs 1460 ,  which was reasonable , but then again we did not try hard drinks  , so with hard drinks the bill  could easily have been rs 3000  .  overall a 2.5 from me ,  go  there for only  beer  as food taste is nothing special to write home about .
