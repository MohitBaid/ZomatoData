Looked at New alipore hundustan sweets stopage.
It is a very small shop to locate.

Not really bad. It's good enough to have dinner. Nice place with good service and ambience. Needs to improve a lot in order to become popular.

Located nearby Hindustan sweets and on your way towards "buroshibtala". A very small joint, serving Chinese cuisines, rolls, chaaps, tikkas, moghlai parathas, fish fries, finger, lollipops, biriyani etc; the taste of their offerings are around average( though has high oil content) and the quantity of their portions are bountiful. The prices charged are quite reasonable too. They doesn't have any sitting accommodation though, hence mostly a take away joint and provides home delivery service as well. Overall an average fast food center sufficiently ideal for quick bites, causal snacks and take aways.

Location: Near Hindustan Sweets, New Alipore.

This place isn't much done up, known for serving rolls, biryani and chinese fare.

The hygiene levels are quite low, better to opt for a take away.
The food quality is average. Needs great improvement, which is a far fetched idea coz' this place earns crazy even at this level.

Have tried the following:

Paneer Roll
The roti was thick yet crisp, but quite greasy.
The filling was generous and out here, the Paneer cubes are tossed on the griddle, found to be fresh at times and at times chewy; and then put into the roll along with raw onion, ketchup, chilli sauce, a hint of lime and chopped green chillies (on request).
Tasted average, have had better.

Veg Hakka Noodles
The noodles no doubt were boiled properly and the veggies were juicy, but, the oil content was high which made the whole thing taste awful.

Prices are pocket friendly.
Quick Service.

An average eatery.

Location: located beside Hindustan sweets. Does a take away service and home delivery service. 

Basically serves biriyani, Chinese cuisines, mughlai rolls at very cheap prices. 

Pros:-
1) a very small shop running and earning quite well
2) located near the shops and provides public with fast rolls and eating service. 
3) home delivery service moderate speed.
4) food is okay

Cons:
1) not maintained at all
2) very dirty and unhygienic place
3) food quality not upto the mark
4) just a profit organisation not a service organisation 
5) no ambience at all
6) no seating place 

Overall, a bad place to eat.
