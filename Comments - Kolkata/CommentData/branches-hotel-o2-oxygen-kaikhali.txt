Branches is located within hotel o2. Food is good and the taste is really good. I had a nice time alone during the Christmas last year. I would highly recommend

Went to the restaurant yesterday after four years and it's all the same. The service is very bad; firstly they delay a lot and secondly, the waiters have no idea what they are serving. The price is very high but in comparison the food isn't something special. We ordered Mutton Rogan Josh but the waiter suggested us Mutton Dabba Gosht. He even changed the chicken dish that we ordered. When food was served we realised that Mutton Dabba Gosht was the same dish that we ordered under similar circumstances four years back. Both the dishes were okay but the soup that we took for starters was good. The decor is  not that good, it felt gloomy.

Went there with my wife and friends on 26/9/17. Apart from the average ambience they left no stone unturned to portray themselves among the wrost and most gross restaurant in the city. Mocktails and cocktails never tasted this bad, food were very average like roadside eatery, overpriced, a long waiting time sitting at the table, the waiters had no idea which table to serve, though it wasnt crowded enough. Been unlucky enough to visit this resturant.

I have been to this place many times as it is near to my house.
The ambience and the hospitality of the staffs are quite good.
The food is also very good. The loved the golden fried prawns the most from the menu.
The fish preparations are really good in this restaurant.
I would recommend all to try this restaurant once.

It was an absolute surreal experience dining in this lovely joint. It was recommended by one  of my friends and I found it in zomato. It's a nice place for a cozy date. The food is absolutely scrumptious and simply divine especially the bhetki which was perfect done. The ambience outside is something I really enjoyed. It is also perfect for family dinners and I would definitely come here soon as the food and service both were top notch.

I'm very glad to have visited Branches in Hotel O2. Though the interiors are well done, I prefer the well-lit open space in the terrace. What a romantic ambience for a dining couple!
I opted for the Indian cuisine - a tangy Murgh Chaat, a creamy Murgh Malai Kebab and a Chocolatey Milk Shake. O2's Dal Kohinoor is a must-try with Kulcha. 
Delicious food and good service, and the pricing is quite reasonable. 
Greatly recommended, you'll surely enjoy the experience.

This is again a late review by me, not a current one. This restaurant is located in Kaikhali -VIP road. But dont get confused as similarly a new O2 VIP restaurant is located adjacent to this old restaurant. I went there twice, first time, we had only some starters and soft drinks, but on the second visit we had our dinner along with my family, hence my experience and rating shared here is based on what we had on the second time. We has Chicken Tandoor, which is quite good, no complain, but then we had some Chicken lababder, Murg Makhani and Tandoori roti....all are quite tasteless and of cheap quality. Tandoori Rotis were quite hard and even the service was pathetic, it took nearly 45 mins to serve these dishes. I would not really bother to refer someone to give it a try atleast.

The Paneer Tikka Masala, Aloo gobi Masala and the Dal Makhani is good and so are the breads. 
The service was quick on most occasions. 
The guitarist during weekends sets up the ambience.

Service is pretty slow. The food is normal and of moderate quality. The ambience is however quite nice. However again location is a big problem. No one will go to that place to eat unless it has become late and u don't want to drive to a better place some distance away to have food.

Most frustrating Service I had ever!!! ¬†Customer service require major improvement. ¬†The attitude is just carefree and casual towards guest dinning on ala carte -- hardly 2/ 3 guests were there. The bar area had some private event. The staffs were busy setting buffet there. Even after 40 mins of arrival none had asked for water.. the basic of any hospitality. The staffs are not responsive. I had raised the attention a number of times about the service...even though I was one 3 guests...... Utter disappointment

Horrible Food along with horrible staff.
They just did not have anything almost half the items from the menu card was not available and finally when we got some =thing which was available with them and what came out was all pathetic.
May be 2-3 hrs before made butter nun they served and when we complaint the liar staff simply said I told you its not available there is, its few we got from party for you.
You please manage with these or else we can serve you rice.
What the hell behaving as if serving food without money.
Will never ever visit this place and suggest everyone to be careful before ordering.

Visited it once. We were only three people and no one else was there. Seems the waiters and cooks were in lazy mood too. The orders came pretty late. but the food quality was really good.

Chatted for hours as there was no hurry from the waiters. Over all experience was good .

I do not on principle  judge a restaurant based on the food they serve during Pujo. Because almost all places in Kolkata have a limited set Pujo Special Menu and the quality ofcourse is much below than what is served normally.

But for O2 I am making an exception. When a restaurant claims that they are having a Biriyani festival, the least you can expect is that the Biriyani served would be good. 

Two of us friends went there on Soptomi night after some pandal hopping. We ordered Fish Kebab and Chicken Biriyani. They initially served us Fish Fingers instead of Fish Kebab. We pointed it out to the waiter and he initially insisted that we had infact ordered Fish Finger as if we are trying to trick him. After we firmly said that we did not he said that he is sending the Fish Kebab but it would take time. We were willing to wait.  The Fish Kebab came after 30 minutes and they were strictly okay. Nothing to write home about. Then the Chicken Biriyani came. Quantity wise it was huge. It had two pretty big pieces of chicken. One was quite sufficient for two of us. But the Biriyani was almost inedible. It was dry. The chicken was tough and not cooked properly. The Biriyani did not even have the typical Biriyani smell. I ordered a Virgin Mint Mojito which was quite well made.

The service was pretty sloppy. We were served our water after asking for it for 3 to 4 times. The servers are quite inexperienced and not able to take the pujo rush.

Location wise this place has an advantage. 6th Floor of a hotel in Kaikhali obviously gives it a view to be proud of. There is an outer open air seating arrangement and an a.c. restaurant inside. The restaurant was perhaps going through renovation because the wall colours were peeling and I could also spot the circuitry at places.

I give this place a one for the Fish Kebabs and another one for the Mojito.

02 hotel owned by the Loharuka group is a pretty old hotel located on Kaikhali main road near Haldiram VIP Road. The rooftop restaurant is located in the old building of the hotel and serves liqour.. It serves only dinner and no lunch.The place is very spacious yet has a great seating capacity but i feel seats should have been better. There is a small open space too for dining. The decor is pretty average. The staff if courteous but not so well trained. The service time is a bit high. The cutlery, crockery, upholstery are very mediocre. 

Indian food
The serving is very generous and the rates are very reasonable for the indian food. The kebabs are very good for those prices except the seekh kebab which is not so good. The vegetables are all very good, rotis are nice. I love their navratan korma which is a bit sweet but to my liking. Biryani is really nice.

Chinese food
The serving is a bit on lesser side and overpriced as compared to rates of indian food. There are routine options but i felt the overall experience of chinese food was not so satisfactory. Rice and noodles were nice but did not like the vegetables alongside at all.

I have not tried their continental cuisine since i do not feel so confident about it. But ultimately if you stick to indian menu of the place, its a great value for money. The place does not give a grand or royal experience but taste buds come out pretty satisfied after the dinner without much burden on the pockets.
