After going through the review of this resurant, I ordered from this resturant. We have ordered The Punjabi Brothers Special chicken... The delivery was quick and friendly.. As per the name of the dish, it was really special. The decoration and garnishing was done in a way as if I have ordered from a 5star resturant.. the was just perfect. If their quantity could be little more tgen i would have given 5 out of 5, thought i will trying more items from this place.

I ordered mixed fried rice butter roti and special punjabi chicken.... Punjabi chicken was good, roti was like roti but the mixed fried rice was not up to the mark it was cooked but it was not tasty, the prawn added to it was stale...next time guys donâ€™t order mixed fried rice from there and one more thing it was delivered to me before time so kudos to that...see you until next review...
