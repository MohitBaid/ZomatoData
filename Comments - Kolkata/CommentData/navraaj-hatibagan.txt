Navraaj is located near Hedua, which mainly sells sweets & Snacks at an affordable price.

Ambience is basic , service is prompt.

Tried Gulab jamun & Dahi Vara, both were decent but still nothing to rave about . 

You can give it a try if you are nearby.

হেদুয়ার একদম কাছেই , দক্ষিনি খাবার এর প্রতি প্রেম ছোট থেকেই  তাই এখানেও সেই মাসালা ধোসা খেয়েছিলাম । ভালই লেগেছিল কিন্তু খাবার এর মান এর একটু বারলে ভালো হত বলে মনে হয়েছে , তবে গোলাপ জামুন খুবই ভালো লেগেছিল ।

Located near Hedua, this place has a limited sitting arrangement. Tried Radhaballavi and Gulab Jamun from this place, both of which were pretty good.

I used to hang out in this place since my college time as my college was near Hedua. With a small seating arrangement, it offers some nice sweets and snacks. I liked their dahi-vada, dhosa and radhaballavi. I also had bundi and some other sweets too. One can visit here to take a wholesome meal in a low pocket pinch. The interior is not that clean as it should be.

This is a small sweet shop selling pure veg food items too. Ambiance is absolute basic. Few tables and chairs on one side of the shop. The South Indian dishes here are not bad and they are cheap. The Dahi Vada was decent. The Radhaballabhi too. The Dhokla was not soft. The sweets are decent. If you are around and want a quick filling but pocket-friendly meal, this is an ideal place.
