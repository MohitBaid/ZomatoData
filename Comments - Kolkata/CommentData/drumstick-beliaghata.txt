Had been skeptical owing to it's view from outside but the food served took me to surprise. 

Ordered Bengali Thali and Fish Cutlet. The ordered dishes were superbly done.
The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity. Fish Cutlet needs a special mention.

The service is good, perhaps a bit slow to some respects but overall can say the quality and taste of food offered was outstanding for the price tag. 

I had an amazing taste experience here. Recommended !!

Its located near Beliaghata.. Very easy to find. I have ordered Chickrn Pilu kebab and their famous Moti biriyani.
The kebab was minced mutton with cheese wrapped in chicken.. It tasted amazing. Must try this dish if you are visiting this restaurant.
The moti biriyani was so so but the quantity was good with two pcs of mutton, egg, one potato..

Customer service - 4/5
Value for money - 5/5

A well known for north indian and chinese cuisine. Visited there 1st time and restaurant seems to be pretty much normal. Tried their special chicken moti biryani and chicken korma. Considering taste it's not questionable. They really had their own flavours which makes you to come here again. Staffs are well behaved and ambience was calm with a soothing music played in background which gives it a proper blending. Hope to visit again.

I didn't know about this. A client brought me here.
Very ordinary decor and nervous staff. At one point, a server came and rearranged our table for 3 minutes trying to make it look more presentable.

But, the food is kinda worth all of that.
We ordered Bengali thaali with Pomfret in gravy and Bhetki Paturi. This is a full-on Bengali meal in itself with good quality Dehradun rice, dal, papad, aloo bhaja and chaatni.
The Mocha Ghonto is pretty good. Didn't like the Shukto as much.
The Pomfret was very well prepared.

The paturi could've been better. The mustard batter was kinda overdone and it should've been smoked for a little while longer.

Overall, recommended.
Reasonably priced too.

Cleverly located in Beliaghata, the restaurant has a cozy seating arrangement. As I heard the name I was quite sure I might end up hogging Chinese / Continental dishes. We ordered Crispy Chicken along with Drumstick Special Noodles & enjoyed the preparations! But ordering Mutton Moti Biriyani by my brother made me give him a stern look. As far as I knew, in Kolkata restaurants like Aminia, Shiraz, Rahmania, Royal specialized in this South Asian rice delicacy! So my mind had the question, "Why here?" Well, soon I got an answer, " Cause it's delicious!"  This place had its own unique recipe (the proper blend of spices with the rice, with mutton pieces & half a piece of potato) to tantalize one`s taste buds. In case you want a variety of cuisine served on your plate in a pocket-friendly budget, surely you can give this place a try! Who knows you might discover a new delicacy of theirs!

Value for money is the apt description for this eatery. The portions are huge, each plate of food can be comfortably shared by two people. We had the Chelo Kebab and the Chicken au gratin and had to pack food back for home. The Chelo Kabab came with buttered rice, a poached egg, a stick of mutton kebab and 6 succulent big pieces of chicken kebab. Tasted quite good. The augratin was delectable...creamy white sauce with pieces of chicken in every bite, baked with cheese on top....what's not to like? I was pleasantly surprised by the price tag on the mocktails on offer. Altogether a very pleasant meal.

This place is very easy to locate , situated amidst the heart of  the busy interconnected streets of CIT more. Been there with a friend for dinner and it's readily accessible by all forms of public transport. As we entered , we were greeted very well by their staff even at those late hours, who were very much dedicated to their job I presume. The ambience was dim lit with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling , and I find the aesthetics top notch for what you'd expect from a place pretty much dedicated to casual dining. Now as far as food is concerned , we ordered a plate of chicken amritswari kebab, butter naan , chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken moti biriyani. The kebab was a delightful twist indeed , as it was a chicken stuffed in chicken preparation which were packed with flavours , and filling at the same time. The salad that they gave alongside was a bit dry and stale though, which they could improve with subsequent services. Then as far as the main course is concerned , the butter naan was nothing extraordinary, but not sure whether I could say the same about the reshmi butter masala. One thing was certain , the cook was very generous with the amount of butter they added to the preparation , and that together with perfect seasoning was a job well done by the culinary department. The biriyani was bland to be honest , the rice was soggy , the chicken undercooked and the taste was certainly not at it's A game. Being a multicuisine restaurant , I really don't expect them to specialise in all departments , but their mughal preparation was certainly not their forte and would need to work harder on it. The service however , was excellent ; courteous staff and one person was enquiring about every dish as we were digging into those plates seconds after they landed on our table . Would definitely give it a second try , given its proximity to my home address ; but the mughal cuisine is something I would stay away from as a precautionary measure to save valuable bucks.

One of the very few restaurants in Beleghata and indeed an awesome one. This was my second visit to Drumstick. I've tried their Mutton Moti Biriyani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Butter naan, Chicken kassa and some mocktails. No complaints when it comes to food. Food here is yummy. The only thing I feel is that the restaurant is a bit congested. The decor is pretty simple and could have been better. Still perfect for family dinners though.

It is difficult to come across a good restaurant in the Beleghata area, and Drumstick, a lovely little family restaurant close to the Beleghata-CIT crossing, is a saving grace. I decided to visit the place with a couple of friends one fine afternoon for lunch. It is a small place, serving the usual Indian and Chinese fare, albeit with quite a few tricks up their sleeves.

The thing that caught my attention first was their playlist of Old Bollywood instrumentals which I fell in love with. The place wasn't too crowded and we got a table immediately. While the place serves both Indian and Chinese, we decided to go down the oriental route and started off with a plate of shredded chilli chicken, followed by Drumstick Special Noodles and Hong Kong noodles for mains, along with a plate of Hot Garlic Chicken. 

The shredded chilli chicken was far from authentic Chinese, but with its tender chunks of chicken and heady aroma of green chilli sauce, we didn't care much, and it was mopped off in no time. Among the two noodle dishes, the drumstick noodles was fine, with a rick variety of veggies, chicken and a fried egg on top, but funnily enough, I thought the Hong Kong noodles were more special than the special noodles themselves. With its generous helping of fried cashews and dominant flavour of star anise not too commonly seen in most commonplace Chinese restaurants, this dish won our hearts. The hot garlic chicken was fine and went well with the noodles.

Service was prompt and the servers were polite. The value for money here is pretty good as well, considering the quality of food served. I plan to try out the Indian dishes the next time I am in the area. Till then, keep up the good work, team Drumstick!

One of the best multicuisine restaurant in the town. 
The food they serve are fresh and hot ,  and is exceptionally delicious,  specially the north indian cuisine. The service is also good ,  the staffs are very well behaved. The only downfall about this restaurant is its decoration,  which haven't change for the past one decade and is not at all attractive. 
The place needs a little make over and promotional advertisements...and bang on!!

It's located about 5 mins from CIT more Beleghata,close to Trikon Park.

The experience wasn't magnificent. But the food was decent enough. Had been there once with my parents,they said it was comfortable enough. Dimly lit and cosy seats,this place is good for family lunches and dinners.

We stuck to the Chinese portion of the menu. 
Overall good, but the chilli chicken was very dry for my liking. They asked if I want gravy, I had said no. But they dried it up to extreme. The pieces were long and without bones,however. 

The Hakka was really tasty,so was the rice. 

Visit once if you're near somewhere. Wouldn't be a waste of time!

A French writer once said, "Every man is guilty of all the good he didn't do" and hence I thought of reviewing this restaurant. Located just beside the Belighata Police Station at CIT Road Morh, this place is articulately designed. The interior are dimly lit and décor give you a sense of calmness.

It is not the place students like me can afford to visit each passing day but I happened to taste few stuffs from this place.

The taste of the items consisting of Mixed Rice, Chilli Chicken, Mutton Kasha tasted really well. There have been times when order has been made at friend's place (situated at Salt Lake) and it got delivered in an around 30 minutes. If the mode of commute would have been a moped or a motorbike instead of bicycle, the delivery would have been faster.

A visit only if you are in mood of experimenting!

So, Drumstick is a pretty awesome place. This place is easy to find, serves great food, and goes easy on your wallet. Pretty awesome, right?

I tried their Chicken Irani Kebab and Chicken Jaipuri Kebab as starters, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and their special chicken preparation (Strangely, I forgot the name. It is layered into white gravy with four pieces of chicken if that helps) in the main course along with Masala Kulcha and Butter Naan. You might think that North Indian cuisine is so common that the flavours are all the same but believe me, Drumstick may still surprise you.

The starters were from out of the world. Six pieces each of tender and flavourful chicken with a great chutney. Bliss.
The main course chicken items provided us with a great contrast with the Tikka Butter Masala accentuating the spiciness while the special dish working on the cream factor. 
And then there was the bread. I have never seen a bigger Butter Naan in my whole life. I used to think that I can easily devour four of them but after watching Drumstick's naan, my claim felt kind of ridiculous. The Masala Kulcha was jam packed with stuffing. Super heavy is the word. 

This is an amazing place located on Hem Chandra Naskar Marg. Finding it is easy enough. The decor is very calming with plush couches lining up one section and old songs playing in the background. A great visit.

Went to this restaurant for a small get together and got totally mesmerized by the sheer high quality of food they served. Though the restaurant may seem little cramped and ambiance is ordinary but the food they serve is absolutely delightful. For starter we ordered fish cheese fry, fish jaipuri kabab and chicken pilu kabab, all of them were too good, special mention goes for pilu kabab, it is totally different from the kababs we eat regularly. For main course ordered masala kulcha, mutton boti masala, chicken hyderabadi, non-veg rice noodles, chicken lat me kai, all of them were delightful, no place for any complaints. We tried variety of mocktails also, they were equally good. Serving time was relatively quick, waiters were knowledgeable and helpful. per head cost was around 700/- which was very pocket friendly these days. Overall had a great experience here and love to visit it again in near future.

Review: The Drumstick

A section by section review of the restaurant focusing on major aspects.

Location - 4/5
Situated near C. I. T. More crossing, fairly easy to find this one. Thanks to big neon sign, finding becomes even more easy when driving by.

Facilities - 3.5/5
No dedicated parking spots, but finding one in this locality is not very tough. During Puja things get fairly complicated due to a lots of Puja pendals in this locality. No dedicated takeaway facilities, but home delivery facility is there.

Ambiance - 4/5
Well spaced tables and comfortable seating arrangements, with decent interior makes it feel good to have food here. Though not a large dinning area, but feels at home.

Food - 3.5/5
Food tastes good, but not worth the what they charge for it. Variety of the foods in the menu and availability of most of them is a plus, while the foods are not very unique to fetch the value-for-money tag.

Service - 3.5/5
You will be served as per the expectations, and the courteous behavior of the staffs, though not very polished & sophisticated in service manners.

Overall - 3.5/5
This is a nice & cozy place near C. I. T. More, ideal for a meal, both with family & friends, which does not leave much to complain about except for the higher prices for most of the items.

Located near C.I.T. More, Beliaghata, Drumstick is the place to hang out often for us, the NICED people. Have been to here literally for 20-25 times. Although now the prices have gone up due to puja, but it will go down again after puja. It is a duplex restaurant. While the 1st floor's decor is good, the ground floor's decor is a little outdated. Coming to the main part, the food part, they do cook very well. Other than their sodas and desserts, we almost have everything till now. We didn't find any issues regarding the taste of the food. The staffs are friendly too. They charge a 5% service tax.

I am not sure why the overall rating for this restaurant is less than 4. I have been to this place many a times and almost have tried all of their dishes including the desserts and mcktails and its been 7-8 years I am going to this place with my family. Each and every item of theirs is just way too awesome to describe and most importantly hygienic.  Trust me guys its been more than 100 times till date and we felt never complaining about the quality of the food neither did we experience any stomach upset acidity or any disorder. Try their sizzlers, kashmiri pulao, Ilish Thali during monsoon, Chicken dahiwali. to me this place is no elss than any 5 star hotel in terms of taste and quality of food.

Prices have increased by 30% and zomato still has the old menu card.
 This I got to know while ordering over phone.
The manager clearly doesn't bother about whatever there is in zomato. Can not promise to deliver within one hour at 1:00 pm in the afternoon within 2 kms of the restaurant. Quite an attitude he has.
Overall too costly for its services.

Only place of its kind in CIT more area. The food is good but not extraordinary. Nice ambiance is a positive side. Bit overpriced though. There are very few dinning places available in this part of Kolkata. Which is why it is not a bad option.

At a guest's house was treated to their veg rice, mixed noodles, hot garlic chicken and chili chicken. The chicken were quite delicious, noodles were scrummy but rice was a bit bland. Overall their food is appetising and delish. For quick Chinese takeouts or hearty meals Drumstick is recommended.

Posh restaurant at a nice location

FOOD: First things first. The food here really sucks. Nothing you order here will be anything worth remembering. Less quantity, tasteless and absolutely worthless food. We ordered some kebabs and the specimen that were served to us were nothing even close to what kebabs are. Totally avoid the place if you love food.

AMBIANCE: Well, the ambiance is really good. U won't get many restaurants playing Tagore songs in the background. This restaurant does that. That is definitely a thumbs up. The place is totally uptown and the seating arrangements are pretty cozy as well. There is a large TV on one side which keeps on replaying some very good football moments of the world.

SERVICE: Service is shit. Food takes at least an hour to arrive. And even if u place your desserts order at the beginning only, still you'll need to wait for another 30 minutes after finishing your main course to get the desserts. Card is often not accepted. And the waiters doesn't even care about your order. Also, the Price is pretty high in comparison to the food they serve.

OVERALL: Only visit this place if you are very hungry and have no other option or only want to enjoy the ambiance and have a lot of time to spare.

Had mutton biriyani. Was a little bit for sweet toothed people. But amount was optimum.
Next we ordered tandoori stuffed alu.Was inedible. Tasted like "vegetable chop" with a little bit of dressing. Overall ambience was great. Serving is good but food needs to improve.

This is now a most prominent restaurants in Beleghata area.It has improved a lot in recenet times as far as food quality is concerned. The seating capacity has also been looked into. The service is good. They also make home delivery within stipulated order and in home delivery cases the quantity does not gets curtailed. The weekend evenings may make you wait a little but the wait is worthy enough.

it was near by our college in beliaghata. so any bday party celebration or after whisky party we used to go to this place for dinner . the place is not having a quality ambiance but the food is somehow oky. I ahve tried friedrice, mutton gravy, chicken and gobi manchurian. the chinese items are good but north indian is not that good. even once I ahve tried their bengali cuisine like rice and sorshe rui. totally dissapointed. but in terms of price the quantity is good no doubt. people livin in beleghata CIT more can  try a dine in here.

While searching for a place for dinner I found this place on the way and the sign board outside appealed me to get in and try out.

**Location**
It's just near the CIT more. It will be on right side if you are coming from Phoolbagan to CIT road beliaghata more. Just before the petrol pump.

Ambiance was such that I was not expecting and they made a point to prove further. Very nicely decorated pure family restaurant feeling. You will love to be with your family here.

**Experience**
I tried their mocktails to stater to main course here and surprisingly the food was very very good even I didn't try the conventional food .

Mocktails: With that pricing the mocktails were genuinely refreshing and quite worth a try. I tried :

Pink lady
Mango Mastani
Both were good.

Starters
Fish cheese fry: The quality of the fish was excellent pure bhetki was the filling inside. Very impressive. Cheesy from inside but they didn't out over cheese to kill the taste of their fish which I liked.

Mains:
Hong Kong style flat noodles just blew me away. I am a big fan of flat noodles and was craving for some good noodles for quite sometime now and they have successfully made me contended with it all. Loved it.

Prawn pieces were big and the hot garlic prawn tasted very yum. Loved it.

Took a parcel of fried rice and chilli Chicken. I must admit their quality as well as the quantity is really good and they maintain a class.

**Service**
The man at the gate was really courteous he is really helpful in nature and loved this attitude as well. The service was okiash not bad but there is room for improvement as well but no complaints.

Must try.

Just a stone throw away from my college nrsmch I remember this joint as a friendly fun loving place to sit and talk with your favourite buddies :-) it's a bit tough to locate from moving vehicle but once you know the place you're sure to come back for more.
We mostly asked the waiters about their specialities and they never let us down
Special mention is there PULAO, 
egg wrapped chicken(can't remember the specific name but it was the best among chicken dishes,just ask them egg wrapped chicken,they'll serve the exact;-)),
DEVIL'S PRAWN(a very spicy yummy dish not comparable to any other prawn dishes I've tasted yet might be called as one of their specialities) and last but not least choco vanilla mousse....but it's not available all the time so you better check it over on phone..
Some very fond memories are associated with this place...this place is suitable for both taking your parents or your friends for a delicious wonder ;-)

Near CIT more towards Fulbagan , Drumstick is a restaurant of North Indian , chinese and bengali cuisine... We visited there after planning suddenly...
The ambience and decor was normal... but the restaurant is not too spacious...
We ordered Butter tandoori roti , Butter naan , Kashmiri naan , Masala Kulcha , Chicken Moti Biriyani , Prawn Biriyani, Kaju Kismis Polao , Malai Prawn , Mutton Boti masala , Chicken Patiwala and Bundi Raita ... And Guess what! one plate of all dishes was more than enough for 9 people ... So the best part here is the quantity... Tastes were also good ... Specially Kashmiri naan and malai prawn were the best in taste ... the lunch was finished with the touch of different kind of lip smacking ice creams...
Service was normally good ...

they serve quick, we ordered a glass of soda and a weired combination of soup and tengri kabab, was really hungry so dint really go by the order. soup tasted really well, so did the kabab, prefect blend of taste and presentation. looking for another visit soon.

Yesterday went for group lunch there. This was my first visit so was eager and couldn't decide what to eat as menu is quite long. 😋
For starters we ordered chicken rashmi kabab and fish tikka kabab. Chicken kebabs were exact tender. We loved them. But these fish were too much soft, forks were of no use. 
For main course we ordered butter nun, mutton and chicken biryani and kaju kismis pulao. Pulao was not upto the mark. Nuns were appreciable. I liked them and of course recommend nun. Biriyani were ok types not that good but pieces were of good size. 
Then as for side dish we had mutton dahiwala, that was very good. Mutton was well cooked and gravy was tasty. Then kadai chicken and chicken do pyaza. Both were good. I would like to say these dishes were not extra spiced so i personally liked them more. We ordered pineapple raita as well. It was really very tasty and it was having much amount of pineapple. 😊 
I am looking forward to try there chinese dishes.

If you ever find yourself hungry in CIT more area this is the place to be. Its a small establishment and the space is somewhat cramped. But the lighting is relaxing, neither too bright nor too dim. The seating arrangement also provides a lot of privacy to have a nice conversation. Service was prompt and the waiters were very well behaved. Now to the main part: food. Their crispy chili babycorn is one of the best I have had in Kolkata. All their other Chinese snacks and dishes are equally awesome. Their butter nan is soft as silk and more awesomely doesn't toughen and become leathery if left out for long. Their biriyani misses the mark though and the same goes for their Indian dishes, which are mediocre at best. The portion sizes are satisfactory and the pricing is reasonable. All in all great value for money. I visited this place 3 times in 2 consecutive weeks, so you can be rest assured this place hits a six in terms of customer satisfaction.

This is the only decent restaurant in our locality so thought of paying a visit tonight. We ordered for one chelo kebab, one special mutton biriyani and one mutton handi. The manager informed us that mutton  handi consists of 4 pieces. However when we received the order i was quite disappointed. Firstly the special biriyani isnt anything special, secondly the shammi kebab in chelo kebab was horrible, it was too hard and the mutton handi consists of only bones and that too just three pieces instead of four. When we complained about it to the manager instead of apologizing he showed attitude and threw a  piece of mutton disrespectfully on our table. The staffs are simply idiot and the manager is aweful. Never gonna visit the restaurant again.

Located near CIT More at Beliaghata; this food joint is a saviour to our "flash" parties. Me and my friend meet regularly at his residence for a drink. Two things I wanna highlight are 'Satay chicken' n 'Fish finger'. Both of 'em come with respective dips. Both tastes yummy. Other than this they had a really wide variety of dishes to try out; of which 'Chicken makhmali' will get a special mention from me. Pair it with butter naan or masala kulcha, and believe me, u won't repent. The only drawback is that the food gets delivered very late, almost 1-1.5 hours after placing the order.

I have been to this quiet little many a times as its close to one of my friend's place.
They have recently increased their capacity. The best part about Drumstick is that they are truly multi-cuisine. They screw up some continental dishes sometimes trying to make it authentic apart from that their food is mostly decent. Try it out if you are around the area.
Must Try : Fish Cheese Fry & the steamed Momos.

Food : 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Staff : 3/5

Drumstick is located near Beleghata cit more.It is a very well known restaurant in that area.I have visited this place with a friend in an afternoon for some snacks after a long day college.We have ordered chilli prawn and noodles,both are utterly delicious in taste and mouthwatering,I heard that they also serves quality tandoori dishes also,will surely try other dishes another day.

This place is just on the main road connecting Beliaghata main road and phoolbagan. Residents here has plenty of options to go for dinner. And being so near to residential places this restaurant is always crowded. The ambiance is family, food is okay but it's late always. You will have to wait for 30 mins for the starters to arrive. I treated my friends on my birthday. Its recommended only when you don't have any other options. But the food is overall average.

Drumstick has alwz  been one of my favourite restaurants.Located near CIT road,beliaghata,this place offers a good ambiance and a warm hospitality.
What I really love is chicken pilu kabab.Must give it a try..You can also try their sea fish roll..The masala kulcha is one of their best serves.its soft,buttery and yummy.Rice items are also good.
Try out chicken hydrabadi or chiken patiwala.I have also tried chiken kasturi masala. Its too heavy and spicy but tastes awesome.You will find varieties of bengali thali.Go for paila baishak thali special.
The price is reasonable and they take a bit time to serve the dishes..But its a very good place for family lunch or dinner.

Been there several times with family. Good food and the ambience is quite nice. Only problem is that the space is a bit problematic. The waiters are very nice and cordial and they know us very well since we are their old customers. Common food menu with some specials of theirs. They are trying to come up with their specials slowly but the food they serve is quite nice and is of average price.

This place is near to my college. As a result of which I visited this place several times. We even ordered food for college functions from here. This restaurant serves a wide range of variety from Mughlai to Bengali Thaali. I once ate Chelo Kebab  here and it was delicious. The ambiance here is soothing and you get a good smile all the staff here. A good place for a family lunch or dine-out.

Located at a little interiors of beleghata, this is a type of restaurant where one can spend time in leisure.. Simple interior, yet the restaurant provides you with a nice and a cozy atmosphere to dine in..
I had heard about the place from my friend, and honestly, i havent regreted being there ever.. Have not tried other dishes much, but all o can say is that the bengali mutton/chicken/ fish meal is just superb!! I never ever get bored to try the same thing whenever i go there.. 
The meal has its own specialty.. Served in earthen utensils, and the hot steaming basmati rice placed on a banana leaf is a treat to the eyes.. All that comes in the meal is separately served in earthen utensils of various shapes and size.. The dal, crispy potato juliens fry, the sabji of the day, and the mutton/fish or chicken and last but never the least, the chutney and papad!! Just WOW!! Whatever has been ordered, all taste equally delicious in their own way.. One would just love to have such a meal.. Satisfaction at its heights!!
The portions served are enough for a person as a meal should provide.. 
Looking forward to visit again, shall try food apart from this in their menu.. Till then, keep it up!!

BT this is a costly restrnt..according to their food quality they overpriced their menu card

The most awesome momos I have ever had are from Drumstick!! Be it steamed or pan fried (8 pieces per plate).. The soup is even better! Sometimes I order momos in the evening, just to get the soup as a complimentary item. There is one more soup you should try: Chicken lung fung soup, it looks as good as it tastes, full of chicken, mushroom, prawn, chopped vegetables, noodles and a topping of egg-white. Although this is a very classy restaurant, the prices are always on the rise...
Recently I tried the chicken sizzler, and chimney soup... Again this is a must-try preparation...!!! Keep it up..

Food is quite good, especially the veg and non-veg thali (Bengali food) is one of my favourites :D. Chinese and north Indian is also ok, especially the parathas and north indian side dishes. The drumstick specials are also worth trying(with a little extra money though). Interior is calm, pleasant with a mild music turned on. I would prefer the ground floor seats over the top floor's because of its better interior design. Price is quite good, keeping in mind the above average quality of food. It's worth a visit. :)

Well well when u act upon the vehement and nagging advice of the attender and order a plate of Jaipuria Kebab and then be served a plate full of absolutely under cooked chicken, its a little disappointing 
And above all we were not offered any apologies for it in terms of any complementary dish.. 

Well u dont Mind a bad review then.

Drumstick.. Lets call it Dumb stick

A small resaturant cramped on the main Hemchandra Naskar Rd, near Beliaghata- CIT crossing.

The restaurant appears to be very posh and upscale from outside and you will try to take a chance. As you enter, you will get a plush yet cramped interior. The menu card (read the prices) are super posh and nothing comes below Rs 200 a plate. We ordered-

1. Mixed Fried Rice
2. Some chicken item

We were taken aghast at the extremely low quantity and average taste of foods here.

Food-3/5
Ambience- 4/5
Value for money- 1.5/5

I shall not visit this place, pay such amount of money for such average food and quantity. Rather I shall drive another km to Rose Resaturant serving much better food.

Recommendation: Avoid

Though I stay near Kankurgachi but had visited this restaurant very recently during durga puja. We had ordered chicken butter masala and tandoori roti but the chicken preparation was not upto the level, it was not soft and smooth at all. Their services was not good at all and I think the items are over priced compare to the quality.  In fact not only we but also a family beside our table complaining about the quality. Sorry to say but we were disappointed.

I have long thought about going into this place and I did have my opportunity to taste all cuisine genres here. The ambiance is good, except that the waiters are not really fluent in English and it would help them if you speak in Hindi or Bengali. The following points should be taken into account:
1. The North Indian section is pretty good considering the taste only. Most of my review marks is based on that. 
2. The Chopsuey is one of the WORST that I have ever eaten in my life.
3. The rice noodles are also crap.
4. The normal noodles in gravy is fine.
5. The Price-Quantity equation is seriously unbalanced and heavy towards the price. Most of the review marks are lost because of this.
6. Its more of a quiet place where mostly family people go and have quiet meals.

My experience was horrible, I have ordered mutton curry for the lunch and when it was delivered, I was awestruck and was unable to decide whether it is to be served to the guests or not. The item was too costly compered to other restaurants but the quality was too cheap compared to others. The main problem is that the mutton curry was not prepared with elaborate care. They might have boiled the mutton pieces and then dipped it into the curry without adding the spices into it which makes it so insipid. This type of stuff are usually found in the hospital bed. It is really unexpected to have such a poor quality food in these days in any restaurant in Kolkata. I may sound harsh while writing my review but I am writing it out of my disgust.

It was my father who brought us to this place because he had often seen it on his way home from the office and a couple of nights ago, he fancied trying it. The chairs and tables are cramped for want of space yet it is a two-storeyed spacious restaurant. We were guided to a small table on the second floor and left to consult over the menu. 

From the Chinese section of the diverse menu, we settled on:
(1) Chicken Hakka Chow: Tad bit oily, one bowl of the chow will sufficiently entertain two hungry people. 
(2) Chicken Fried Rice: It was a bit dry and the rice they used was the Dehradun Rice that is mostly used for the Indian style fried rice with peas. It was far from 'Chinese'.
(3) Manchurian Chicken: The bowl contained ten uneven chunks of undercooked chicken tossed about in a flavourless gravy.
(4) Hot Garlic Fish: The two points are entirely because of the ten uneven pieces of the soft and well-cooked fish. I would have licked the whole bowl clean had I not to share it with my parents.

Amounting to a touch above Rs 1400, the bill left me wondering the very many ways that money could have been better spent. The waiters were friendly but appeared ill at ease about what they should be advising the customers to eat. Other fellow customers even spelled out dishes that the waiters had never heard of.

A really good and cost effective experience at this restaurant was quite unexpected especially coz the location is not a typical food location, kankurgachi pantaloons would be the nearest proper landmark for this place! The name is suggestive of a typical Chinese restaurant,but the Indian cuisine we tried here was just too good to ignore! The ambience is nice but nothing catchy. The chicken jaipuri kebab was a new kebab we tried here and we all were spellbound with the subtle flavour. Even the chicken drumsticks we took alongside fell flat in comparison. The continental section,however,is not as authentic,with the lasagna having very little cheese sauce and lots of red sauce,nevertheless,it was quite good in taste. The schezuan fried rice with Hong Kong chicken was yummy,so was the paneer pulao with chicken tikka butter masala. This place becomes a must visit for people who throng about sealdah area coz there's nothing of this standard in and around that place!

Drumstick is a very good place. I have eaten here a couple of times. First time my brothers girlfriend took us there for her birthday. I liked the cosy ambience where we could talk in peace and enjoy ourselves. We had ordered Chinese food that day and I loved the taste, especially the noodles and the chilly chicken. I am not a lover of lemon chicken but my cousins loved it. We had also ordered fried rice and garlic chicken. Each and every dish was good. I recommend this eatery if you go to the area. I plan to visit here one again.

It's a small sweet restaurant on CIT Road. Little dark room but sometimes you will like it.

Foods are good with reasonable price.

I'd chello kebab and trust me after Peter cat it was just awesome. 

Chicken tengri kebab also good one.

Hope will be there once more to test my test buds  :-)

I went to this place many a times and was just amazed with their food quality. My hubby introduced me to this place and I just loved it.
First time I went there my hubby(then boyfriend ) and a friend. that was my first time and I liked it a lot. We ordered Chicken Hariyali kebab followed by Hongkong fried rice and Shanghai Chicken...Both were awesome.

Once tried their Special ice-cream which was delicious... Even their Prawn dishes are also great....

Loved to go there....

It was not always "Drumstick" this place used to be called "The Chinese Room", and i am talking about 15-20 years back. This restaurant has come a long way to rightfully claim the title of one of the "most beautifully ambient, quality food serving restaurant"  in the area. Though I havn't visited it in the last 8 months but I still remember the tasty, juicy, succulent "Mutton Rung Roast" i had with my family, the last time i came to dine here. it was simply heaven, and on top of that they have a wonderful array to desserts & ice-creams that you could choose from, to satiate your sweet tooth, or that annoying post meal sweetness cravings.

In my opinion the service & the wait time is satisfactory if not impressive, and they do have earned a repute for their quick & efficient 'Home Delivery' system.

This is an ideal take away place in the Beliaghata area. The quality of food used to be decent. However, in recent times they have slightly increased their prices fortunately with a corresponding increase in the quality of food. The Chinese food is pretty good and the quantity served is substantial. In fact, the chicken fried rice here is more than enough for 3 people ( people with a good appetite that is!). Special mention for their Chicken Jaipuri kabab, which is excellent and their Mutton Boti kabab. The ambiance of the restaurant is okay, not somewhere you would probably prefer taking your guests. But the food is definitely worth a try. Its a 3.5 from my side!...Hope u enjoy the food..or atleast give it a try!

Its a good place for a quiet weekend...After sampling so many so called sophisticated dining establishments, this place turned out to be a nice change. The place is small, but very neat and clean. There is a certain ambiance that's very relaxing . The food is good, specially the Chef's specials. Try out the pilu kebab and the irani and jaipuri kebabs. Lip smacking indeed. For main courses, I prefer their indian offerings more than their chinese offerings. Somehow I didn't find the chinese food too special. However, their Indian servings are really nice. Prices are ok,and shouldn't be a problem.Overall , I have always had nice experiences each time i visited this place. Somehow, you enter this restaurant without any expectations,and leave with a smile.

This place has to be one of those places I order from a lot. They make a decent chicken bharta and most of their chicken items are fairly tasty. However, on two separate occasions I have ordered their fish dishes and both times the fish was not fresh, so I steer clear from that section. 

The ambiance and service is okay, nothing to write home about. The prices are reasonable.

The place has a very nice ambience and you will love the solitude of the place.
The quality of food here is very good but the Kabab items cost a bit high and only 6pieces are given.
Availability of the items are nice, not too much of items but most of the times you will get what you need. Service is late but the behavior of the Waiters are decent. Not much a crowd even in weekends.
The quality of the Indian main dishes(especially Biriyani) is not upto the mark but Chowmein is Really nice both Gravy and hakka but in hakka chow they add sauce which is not very good.
The cost of beverages are too much

Quality of food is highly unpredictable. On good days, the food is good and eatable otherwise there have been instances when i wondered how this restaurant justifies its price. Being the only restaurant around the area sure gives it the advantage of monopoly. 
Prices of most items are comparable to Park Street restaurants and the price seems to increase every month.  Veg pulao is one item which is consistently good. If you are having Bengali i suggest stick to veg. Chinese is very average. Kebabs are good.
 The seating is cramped for groups less than 6 and waiters will keep loitering around. Dinner will definitely be an uncomfortable experience in terms of ambience. 
It is best to stay away from this place unless you can travel or order from somewhere else. 
Also this restaurant is in Beliaghata CIT more and not in Lake Town as listed.
