Star Fast Food is located at Maniktala main road just beside Swad Restaurant near to the Blood Bank. Its very basic simple & small restaurant serving very few dishes on their menu card. You will generally found this restaurant pretty empty, lets see why?

I parceled a simple dinner from here that includes the following. As they have very less items & all are prepared so they serve you really fast. However the cooking happens roadside so hygiene is bad.

Mutton Tikia : Tikia patty was totally dipped into old burned oil. It was full of poor quality spices. Patty was dried inside, where gravy was full with the excess broken pieces of tikia. Don't ask about the meat quality, you guessed it right it was not fresh. It was nothing more than excessive oily, hot, spicy & absolutely bad at taste. The oil was so bad that it can create acidity into your stomach.

Rumali Roti : It was unbelievable, even their Rumali Roti was so bad. It wasn't soft enough & felt little hard to chew. It doesn't tasted good either.

Conclusion : The basic menu & less prices may make you think to have a simple dinner done over here. But believe me guys they serve extremely worse quality food. You don't wanna fall ill right? Then please skip this restaurant. This is for those who doesn't love their stomach.

I go for this place only when I have no other option left in Maniktala area. Best For takeaway. Food is extremely unhygienic too much oil . Chicken Chap , Chicken Rezala and Rumali Roti are still okay than the other items .

Star is an old establishment with cheap food that are average taste wise. It has a better interior decorations among all the moghlai cuisine outlet nearby. Most of the time their plates, glasses and cutlery are spotless. However service is bad especially during busy ceremonial times. A good restaurant if you want cheap average food for family dinner during normal days.

Situated at manicktala Star is over 20 yrs old. Though they are known for biriyanis yet their mutton kasha dish is an absolute treat to have.
