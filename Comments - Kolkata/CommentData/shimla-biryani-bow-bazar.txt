Each Friday after the Jummah prayer, biryani in the stomach is "kind of" necessity for me. With this view, I always taste each passing restaurants or stalls on each week. One such week, I stumbled upon Shimla Biryani and got myself rejuvenated in such a extent that I made it a point to add it up on Zomato.

Located on Phears Lane just few metres away from the crossing and just walking distance from Central Metro Station, this is a small stall like eatery but has seating arrangement for 8 people. It excels itself in Take Away but I always preferred for "Dine In" in those plastic chairs.

Though it serves three types of Biryani (Chicken, Mutton, Aalu), Chaaps and few miscellaneous items, my mind always sticked with Biryani!

It serves a prominent quantity biryani and charges Rs: 45 for Aalu and Rs: 70 for Chicken Biryani. I have had tasted both of it and they taste exactly the same. The salad is complimentary and you will get unlimited fill in as long as you ask. Also, an extra aalu can easily be achieved upon asking and they do not charge extra for it.

Two guys, preferably brothers, serve the place and they are extremely polite. The servings are neat and quick and they take great care in cleanliness.

With fifty rupees in pocket, you can easily fill your tummy with biryani and soul with satisfaction.

A Must Visit Eatery!
