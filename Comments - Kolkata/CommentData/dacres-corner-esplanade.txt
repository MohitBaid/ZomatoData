Dacres Lane is a happy hunting ground for the food lovers. Dacres Corner is situated at the starting point of the Dacres lane from Lalit Great Eastern end, opposite of EIILM.

Foods are decent to some extent . Sitting arrangements are well. Staffs are well behaved. You can try their snacks like Egg devil at evening. However if you are planning for lunch then You must not try their SHUKTO. So bizarre in taste. but fish curry was good enough.
I would recommend you should try the snacks at evening.

well to say the least this one place should be visited just for the sake of its ancient value...it is one of those rare places in Kolkata where bigwigs of all times have set foot during their struggle period....a must see...I recommend...
