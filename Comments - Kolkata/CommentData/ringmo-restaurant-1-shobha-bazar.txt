I tried their chicken cutlet, which is amazing. I hear, they make excellent Fish Fry and Fish Pakoda which I personally have not tried out yet, but I look forward to it.

This place has enough to offer to a foodie, who would want to have a taste of the authentic and popular Kolkata fast food. Located in North Kolkata -near Kumartuli Park(famous for its Durga Puja Pandal to all Kolkatans), this place will indulge you with the awesome fish fry(read cutlet), chicken Cutlet, mutton cutlet, fish fingers, rolls, moghlai and many more. 
Do have a go at this restaurant when you visit Sobhabazar or nearby area.

Loved the fish fry and the chicken cutlet. Not everyone can make fried that crispy and Ringmo has the best to offer!  If you are looking out for authentic junk food in North Kolkata l, then this is the place which deserves a special mention.
