Food quality was not good....
Service was on time...
Please maintain...
The pasta was cold enough to eat.
French fries were too much fried...
I asked to keep the corn less spicy,still it had chillies..

I was really unhappy with the pizza as the cheese was not baked up to the mark.It was feeling as if I was eating a normal cheese rather than a mozzarella one.Kindly bake the pizza properly.

One of the finest taste. To check that,  I order paneer of 3 different types and guess what?  Each of it had its own flavor.  Brownie was damn awesum.  The price tag is acceptable and justified.  I would go for more orders in future.

Believe me or not this ain't a good food, it is Tandoori roti served by Raasta cafe. Had ordered 6 Tandoori rotis along with main course and this is what we are served after waiting for 45 minutes. Don't bother ordering dal makhanki as you are going to be served yellow dal in the name of dal makhani.

Tried sandwiches here sometime back which were nice but a bit costly for having it regularly. Also tried a vada paw recently as a takeaway, which was definitely not recommended, the potato had no spices, and the only spice was the rocket powder used in south Indian dishes sprinkled over the bun.

I don't know about the restaurant I ordered au gratin from swiggy I had been looking for some great food which will be a great combination with the under 17 world cup. It came quick and fast and I got it server hot. I really like swiggy for this. The au gratin had a solid crusty look at first and as I scooped the spoon at the side where the crust is weak a chunk of crust came out along with peas and a amazing sause containing various vegetables. It was hot and ridiculously tasty. I am not sure about other items from this restaurant but this is among the best dishes I have tasted. Pocket pinch is a 125 . I am updating this I ordered this 2nd time this Time the crust of the au gutin wasn't crunchy at all.....so 1 star less otherwise it's still good üëç

This a very small joint and their items are reasonably priced. They don't compromise on the taste of the food inspite of the items being pocket friendly. 
Their mixed sauce penne pasta is a must must try. It has become my favorite now. Sandwiches are good. I have also tried their veg fried rice and veg manchurian which is also pretty good. Their pizzas are fine . I have tried the Mexican one. I normally order food from home and they deliver it within half an hour . It won't pinch your pocket at all.

Location: This outlet is located at very well known lane named ramlal mukherji lane opposite to axis bank. Even though there are many restaurant and fast food shops around this location but this one seems to be most frequented by people mainly by student/young crowd. They also provide home delivery which is a plus point for me because I like my food at my comfort. 
Coming to the food I ordered periperi paneer sandwich and Cheesy Burger both dishes was well prepared with sufficient fillings and a very good portion size,food was simply amazing and fulfilling. next I ordered Oreo shake a must try drink of this cafe I must say. 
This outlet is also one of the very few outlets which has all their menu items throughout. Be it sandwiches,pasta,brownie or north Indian every thing was available. All and all a nice place to have food from here and very much pocket friendly.

Today we had made an order for north indian. The presentation and smell was yummy but as soon we tasted the food it had double salt in it. All the three items was salty. When we made a complain the owner was like the restrauant had closed and no help can be provided. Being with my brother we had to waste the food as it was not consumable. The masala kulcha even had high salt in it. It was my first and worst and evn last expreience

Recently visited Raasta Cafe,  not a kind of cafe which you would expect. Food quality is average. I tried Pasta and cheese garlic bread. Food quantity was better than food quality. Pasta could have been better if the sauce would have been slightly thicker and right amount of salt would have been sprinkled. :)

Last week I finally planned to visit this place with one of my friend after so many recommendations from my colleagues. For a vegetarian like me, there were so many options available in Howrah but i decided on it and I really loved this place, The service at this place is very responsive,rates are very affordable and they will make sure that you eat till you burst out. Their dishes serving size is big enough for two be it pasta, sandwich,paneer tikka,chowmein or the most welcomed dish to our table Sizzling Brownie topped with a scoop of vanila icecream..we enjoyed our food...It was not that much crowded because of which we were able to enjoy more more n more.... Services and staff Kindness was extraordinary... Hygiene and presentation was extremely fantabulous. Liked everything we ordered what not..!!!!!An overall satisfactory and memorable experience.... I strongly recommend this place to all food lovers.....Cheers!!!!!!:)

I almost forced my sister go to this place with me, and it was followed by a lot of curses from her. We were really hungry when we went there, so we planned we would atleast order three dishes. However, fate had something else for us in store. We mutually decided to order for a cheesy nachos, and trust me, never order that from there. It was'nt just bad, it was pathetic. I would have made peace if the nachos were not that tasty, or the preparation was not up to the mark, it would have been completely ok with me. Or for that matter, even if the nachos were soggy, but sadly that was not the case. The nachos were like they were exposed to direct air for atleast two days and then served with very little helping of some veggies and some white liquid which they thought was liquid cheese, but it wasn't. It was something like mayonese, but not exactly mayonese. The taste was bad, but even that is not the issue, they were not edible, to the extent that you will feel the pain in your teeth once you take some bites. I was really unhappy, so I asked them to replace it and what they did was, they came up with the same plate and this time it was baked. It made it all the more worse, it became harder than before to chew. If I were blindfolded I would easily think I was eating thermacol. It's very rare that I waste food, specially after paying for it, and we left the entire plate as it is. I have attached the pictures of before and after baking. When I politely confronted the person at the counter, he was not ready to accept that the nachos were stale and bad, all he had to say was " its not possible". He was so adament that when I asked him to taste it himself, he flatly refused on my face. I know food, and that wasn't it! Iam sorry people, this is not how you operate, you don't serve inedible swell to your guests and then vouch for its freshness. No offense people, but that experience forbade me to order another dish, inspite of the hunger pangs. Just a polite acceptance of the mistake (not even an apology) would have been enough to make me order another dish and set foot there the next time, I would happily have given you the benefit of doubt. Kindly look into the matter 
P.s: this review is totally unbiassed and base on my personal experience!

I love munching here!  I haven't eaten here in a little while, but for some reason I started thinking about their Cheesy vada paw last night and I decided I need to eat there soon.  Everything on the menu is great, and the bread is superb.  It's very fresh and garlic chutney it really adds great flavor to Vada paw.  We've gotten some large orders of pasta and sandwiches for parties, and everything always turns out great.  Can't wait to eat there again!

The place is small, nevertheless the food is delicious. You can spend quality time there gossiping with friends or spending time with ur beloved, having no one nearby to disturb. ;) We had Corn Sandwich and Choco Nuttela Sandwich which left us licking fingers. Also had Mix Sauce pasta which was rich and excelent .However their serviceman seems untrained who took our order but good in behaviour. Never mind, it's a nice little place for veg food and most importantly, pocket-friendly too :)

More of a restaurant than a cafe serving a wide range of food in Howrah.There is hardly a mainstream dish which does not feature in thier menu.They offers you the Most luscious sandwiches in the Town(Raasta special and Corn Cheese are the most exquisite of them).Mix sauce pasta,Schezwan Fried Rice,Chinese Bhel & Cheese Vada Pav are a few of the other must try items.Nothing Much to mention about the ambience except some Pleasant music and a well maintained dine in area.Service is quite fast and the home delievery option is like a cherry on the cake.

A more emphasis on Quality,Hygiene and Customer satisfaction clearly suggests that they are more on the business end,desiring to build a good repo among customers.

My Ratings:
Food: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambience(Of Least Relevance in their scheme of things): 2.5/5
Value For Money: 5/5
Overall:4.5/5

P.S: Please Find a proper backup for mohan,as the food does not remain as @delicious in his absence :P

Many small food spots keep popping up in the dobson road area.There are few that are able to sustain and consistently deliver .raasta cafe is one of those few.

Its a small place with minimal decor but with a growing customer base.

Ive been getting sandwiches many times in the past from there.These are large sized bread slices sumptuously laden with filling,cream,cheese and are total value for money.The bombay sandwich which has a potate pattyy in between layers of cream and chesse is what ive really liked.They also add in a complementary packet of potato wafers .

Im not quite sure of the other items though.I took home a paneer paratha today which was more like a thick naan with a thin lyer of panner just below the surface.Too dry to be had without gravy.some weeks back i ordered a crispy babycorn which wasnt crispy.

The service is quick and staff quite courteous and quick proactive in making amends .
