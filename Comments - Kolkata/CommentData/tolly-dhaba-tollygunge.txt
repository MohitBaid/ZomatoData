Very bad quality..opted for a egg chicken fried rice take away.. actually I asked for a mixed but they said only egg chicken fried rice is available..however to my utter dismay it contained 4-5 pieces of think shredded chicken and very little egg.. costed 120 bucks..but the material was just fried rice with very few veggies again which you have to minutely search for and almost nil chicken and egg.

Worst experience till date. Ambience was not good, seats of the chairs were extremely dirty. Service was worst. Biryani taste was not up to the mark. Salad was also not available, after we asked for onions they provide us onion but lemon was not available. They cant even serve properly. Most of the items mentioned in the menu card was not available. Chicken was not properly washed ,it contains strings of threads. Will never try to visit again ever. Wastage of money. Even there was no salt and pepper pot in each table. They also forget to provide tissue.

Ordered via swiggy. 
Ok so we have ordered butter nun, chicken rezala, crispy chilli chicken. 
Nun was soft and enough in quantity..chicken rezalla was a bit different in taste..crispy chilli chicken was a bit hard but more than enough in quantity. Cost is reasonable. But the quality of the food is not up to the mark.

Food is really nice. I know ratings can be decieving but believe me if you're a foodie, you must visit Tolly Dhaba for sure. And for some people, I would like to say, it is clearly visible if the reviews are genuine or actually targeting at someone.

Located near navina cinema, my first visit to this place is surely the last one too! The place with it's wonderful ambience of flies and a weird smell was simply mesmerizing! Though at times, we ignore the ambience when the food served is beyond words and this place could have held that place forgiven the fact that 'beyond words' meant something palatable (I'm forgetting the word 'awesome' for this restaurant). 
Coming to the food, we had fried rice which was had an awesome stench smell . The chicken pieces of the manchurian chicken which was large enough was probably made for zombies (do zombies even eat that kind of a chicken?). Well I've never rated any restaurant so low a rating. 
The price was fortunately spared of GST but the price hardly made up for our disastrous lunch. 
Thank God we didn't try any extra dishes. Hope they make up their taste and ambience in the future otherwise a total thumbs down for this place!

It's the quitenssial dhaba for the people in tollygunge area with lipsmacking food.With great location and free parking place is cosy and jam packed..car service is available..Ordered Reshmi kebab,naan and bharta ..

Food quality similar like any other dhaba.its great.
Pocket friendly,staffs are more friendly. Best part is They offered us complimentary borhani which is I think the best in Kolkata..Overall a five-star..Must visit for food lovers not ambience lovers

We took delivery from this Place. Based on close location we chose this dhaba.we ordered 
1.Chicken Tandoori
2.kachhe gosht Biryani
3.Chicken Kosha
4.mixed Fried Rice
5.Garlic Chicken
6.Firni

They recommended the Biryani which I think the best in Kolkata. Kosha was pretty good. Garlic chicken and fried rice tastes better than any other comparatively in tollygunge area.. Firni is the best of all.. Price for all came
900 which is pretty cheap according to the food.. Highly Recommended.A must visit for all the youngsters and students like us.

Today we had the unfortunate experience to visit this restaurant if you can call it that.Located close to Navina cinema hall it was not a difficult find.
On entering we were greeted by some flies and a weird smell.After some discussion we decided to go for 4 plates of fried rice and a plate each of schezwan chicken ,garlic chicken and manchurian chicken.Later on however, on seeing the quantity we had to order an extra plate of rice.
After some time we were served the food.The waiter came up with 4 plates full of rice and since there were 6 of us we thought the quantity was good enough.But boy were we wrong!! In-spite of taking a note that there were 6 of us they served 4 of us with plates full of rice and the rest two were not served anything.What is astonishing is the fact that we personally had to ask for extra plates so that we could divide the rice in 6.
Having the 1st spoonful of rice we were hit by a stench,not smell but a literal stench coming from the rice which they claimed was due to the use of soy sauce.How can a perfectly white fried rice have soy sauce was beyond me.And so we decided to get it changed which they did.The 2nd serving was little better as the rice were under-cooked and absolutely no flavor was present.It was barely edible.
The garlic chicken was not garlicky even though the pieces of meat were quite large and the meat was tough to say the least.The less said about the manchurian and the schezwan, the better, as we could not figure out what went into the gravy and why it tasted weird.We literally had to use all our strength to tear the meat.Maybe,just maybe the water was the only proper edible thing they served.
Lack of food quality can be accounted for but the lack of simple common sense baffled us to say the least.
Though the place does not change gst as of now I am not going to talk about the pricing because the best you can do is avoid the place and pray you never have to taste anything they have on offer.

One word - fabulous. Awesome quality of food. Never had that much big tandoori before visiting tolly dhaba. The great part is that they maintain their quality during Durga Puja which many renowned restaurants cannot. They have a special biriyani in which they give reshmi chicken instead of normal biriyani chicken and it is awesome in taste. It becomes one of the "must visit" restaurants.

Pathetic food, first, the delivery, need to be gifted to be such dumb, when I said take a right to the delivery boy, he took a left, though I appreciate that he reached, food was for rs 385, I paid rs 500, and he did not have change, forget change of rs 100 or 50, we had to give him change for even rs 10. Now the food, ordered afghani biriyani, it was anything near biriyani, chicken was pulled out from some other dish and put into... There was a fried item in that biriyani, let's call it pakora, we did not even understand whether it was veg or non veg.... It was really shocking... Now the lacchaa parota, I think the chef has a free supply of oil and it was wrapped in roll paper... Chicken bharta was floating on oil..... Thanks but no thanks... Avoid is the only word.

6 star service and food quality even during Durga Puja. It is a very new place on the road situated near South City Mall. Tandoori size is huge, I have never seen such size. Price is very affordable. They need recognition to grow more. I wish that they continue to keep their quality like this and better.

Had one of their special dishes-Murgh Afghani Biryani. Taste was fine, nothing out of the world though. I liked the way the entire biryani had been tossed with beresta fried in ghee. The chicken piece was soft and smeared with a rich masala paste. The raita which came with the biryani was extraordinary-creamy,refreshing and with the right texture. Worth a visit folks.

The food is really good. If you love spicy food, you just HAVE to try the Crispy Chilli Baby corn here; super spicy and great amount too! The chicken fried rice had more than enough amount of chicken(which nowadays is not found in a lot of restaurants), and the garlic chicken was good too, 8 pieces at 120 bucks! The service needs lots of improvement though, since the restaurant's new and staffing is not adequate. You will love it if you come to a restaurant solely for good food at pocket friendly prices.

Wanted to try the kacchi gosht biriyani, tehari gosht and butter naan at tolly dhaba, a newly opened place in prince anwar shah road. But tehari gosht wasn't available, so opted for two plates of that biriyani.

They served 2 chunks of mutton, 1 piece of galwati kabab in the biriyani, salad and a glass of burhani ghol with it. Quantity with respect to the price was good. But, the taste and quality seemed pretty average to me. I will rate the dish as a 2.5/5

Not recommended.

After spending some qualty time with my g.f, we went to tolly dhaba to fill our empty stomach and also to have Their main attraction murg afghan biryani.. Quite cozy location and well maintained, few seating available.. We ordered murg afghan biryani, special chicken roll & pepsi.. The biryani was delicious both quantity and taste wise but the special chcken roll was ordinary chicken roll only, the pocket pinch is also very affordable, but the staffs are not at all good from all the aspects, not informative not helpful server nothing..

Been there almost 5-6 times,but they never disappointed us with their food.We tried a lot of their dishes during these times which include Chicken Korma,Butter Naan,Butter Chicken,Murgh Afghan Biriyani,Mixed Vegetables,Chicken Manchurian, Garlic Chicken,French Fries,Crispy Chilli Babycorn.
Last night we ordered Mixed Fried rice, Garlic Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Murgh Afghan Biriyani.
The food has not degraded even a little,it was bang on.The outlet being pocket friendly is just the icing on the cake.It is highly recommended for people seeking good food at pocket friendly prices.

Tolly Dhaba is located near Anwar Shah Road, Tollygunge. Excellent place to try traditional punjabi & bengali food. Their Kachhi Biriyani is something new to our Kolkata food lovers. This place will one of the favourites amongst people who have routined night outs. Home delivery facility is also available. It is suitable for the pocket as well. So, I will recommend this place!
