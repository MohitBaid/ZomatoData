Had ordered for a Veg Roll and an Egg Roll.
The egg roll was filled with cucumbers and onions only while the Veg roll was too oily and was filled with potatoes, chillis and capsicum. I really wouldn't be recommending this to anybody.

The food is awesome. I ordered paneer butter masala and khuska pulao. Khuska pulao is their signature dish which was marvelous and paneer butter masala was perfectly matching with it. Overall my experience was awesome.
