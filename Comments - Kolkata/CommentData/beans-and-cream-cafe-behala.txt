The crispy baby corn was so yummy! Please do try it out. I come here often as the prices are very reasonable. The fish and chips is not that bad as well. Give this place a try.

One of my favourite place to go out and chill nearby . Love the ambiance and the coffee. Roasted and pan-fried chicken is my favourite. The sandwich they serve is also good. Pretty reasonable pricing.

Baked brownie fudge is my personal favourite. As it  located near my place I pay my visit very occasionally. A perfect destination for sudden hangouts with friends and gossips over a coffee. The cappuccino is good. The staffs , workers and even the owner are friendly and good at their services. Being formed recently not having a big label but still it gives a good competition to CCD located next to it.

I have been a regular at this place and I would gladly like to declare that the quality of food and the behavior of staff have gone up with time and that has pushed me to increase their rating to a 4. This is situated just opposite to MP Birla school in James Long Sarani, so it is better to get off at Jodu Colony or Ashoka movie hall and walk towards James Long road. It is a cozy place of having a seating capacity of 15 people indoor and 4 people outdoor. The outdoor option is obviously good for smokers. The food ranges from desserts to pastries to pastas to mohitos to mocktails and beverages. I have tried almost all the items and I seriously have no complaints. Low on the pocket and cozy going place like this is the one suitable for an Adda joint for people like me who look forward to spend a quality time at a cafe.

So winter is coming and I can't keep calm. Visited this small outlet tonight when I was out for dating. It's a cozy coffee den located outside M.P.birla high school and beside Curry Patta food joint. It was my first visit there and I already fell in love with it.when we arrived ,it was pretty crowded and all the seats were occupied. So we had to wait for like 5 min which we we're ok with. As I mentioned earlier ,this is a small Cafe and has a sitting arrangement for Max 10-12 people. We ordered a cafe mocha (hot coffee ) chicken sandwich (grilled and served with potato chips and tomato ketchup) , a plate of spicy chicken , a chicken platter combo (it contained chicken grilled sandwiches with potato chips , iced peach flavored tea and a chocolate tart ).first the beverages we're served .I just loved the flavored iced it. It's refreshing and sugar was aptly used ,not too much not too less.other food were good too .it's a must visit . I highly recommend this place.
Pocket pinch : affordable

We stayed there almost 3 hours as we we meeting our friends after a long and thoroughly enjoyed the foods. This place is pocket friendly and quality of their foods were really appreciable. 

P.S. : my personal opinion, their 'Chicken Spanish Sandwich' is a must try. I found that dish yummy.

Ordered for Home Delivery. We had ordered Walnut Brownie, Chocolate Truffle Pastry, Chocolate Pyramid Pastry, Hot Fudge Brownies, Butterscotch Ice cream with Chocolate Sauce & Mango Shake.
The pastries were good but I would have expected a bigger size as per their pricing.
The walnut brownie was stale but the Hot Fudge Brownie was just Wow with molten chocolate filled on top. I would still complain about the quantity. The Ice cream was decent.
The worst was the Mango Shake. It smelled of some chemical and did not have any hint of Mango. Probably they used some outdated Mango essence or something like that. All in all a mixed experience. Would rethink before re-ordering with them.

A small place located opposite to MP Birla school, has a great staff and comfy seatings.
I've tried french fries, cheese sandwich, shakes ,pasta, cheese balls and chococcino here. Chococcino is my favourite from the lot, it is such an amazing chocolate hot drink. Trust me, you ought to try it.
Another favourite is cheese balls , ive tried this dish at so many places .. but this is the best one i have tasted

Entered with a heap of expections as one of its peers is doing really good nearby. We ordered Spanish omelette, sausages in Thai sauce, pan-fried fish n moccha.. let's come to the other part of this bistro .. there was only one staff who singlehandedly  managing from order taking to wiping off the table...hence consequently reasonable delay was there...but the quality of food was highly compromised! Trust me folks, the omlette was nowhere similar to even plain vanilla omelette! However, the sausages had offset the previous performance üòâ.
Everything was bearable until two tall guys (probably known to the management) had entered the cafe n almost threw a sachet of ketch up at us even without looking at us! Just shocked! However, we withdrew the order of pan fried fish as they didn't prepare till then...n obviously we were looking for a reason to get out of that cafe! A pledge to improve the hospitality part of the cafe even beyond food...

This is the first time I have been here. Nice ambiance with spacious sofas and chairs. There is a TV inside the cafe and you can seat outside also. Both indoor and outdoor seatings are available. It was not so crowded when I went there. The service a 7/10 as I had to seat there for 15 mins before the guy came and took my order. But the food was given within 10 mins or so which was good. The food is average. Great place for chilling out with friends and family.

I went with one of my friend.For a place like behala it's a small casual cafe.The money is worth it the mojitos we're really very good.The pasta was just blehhh.No such taste and it wasn't even well cooked.The fish chips had a hair in it which was really disgusting.The waiter apologized and changed it.The ambience is nothing great but good for a small talk.The mojitos are great.One time visit.The service was good too.

Not a bad place at all to have a little meet-n-greet with old friends from school days. Very prompt service and good attitude of the servers/waiters.
We ordered:
1)The Biritish classic Fish and Chips- A little too fried but the fish was very smooth and went perfectly well with the mayonnaise that was served along with it.
2)Caramel Custard- So one of my friend introduced my to this French classic dessert and I wasn't dissapointed at all. IT WAS SO PERFECT! Not too sweet and not too soft. The custard was made to perfection and the caramel blended perfectly with the custard. MOST RECOMMENDED.

It's a small cafe with surprisingly wide range of food items on their menu. But I guess it was bad timing when I decided to go there that their cook was unwell so we were availed only beverages and snacks. I ordered a pizza and a Patty, which were decent enough, although over priced. Mojito that I ordered was just okay. Service staff was welcoming and polite. My overall impression for this cafe is that it's over priced. They should either increase the amount of food they are offering or reduce the price.

Out of all the restaurants‚Äã and cafes I have been to, this is the only place where you have to pay lesser than your actual bill. That's why even when you pay the bill you feel very happy and contended. 
It is a very pocket-friendly cafe with food absolutely fine with respect to both quantity and quality. 
The ambience is also okay. 
The one field where they can certainly improve is their hospitality and they also take a lot of time to serve the dishes. 

Overall, it is a nice, pocket-friendly place to chill out with friends.

Located just opposite to M.P.Birla foundation school on james long sarani. Really a small place but its nice and clean. Only one person in charge of the place so automatically a bit slow in service. Food menu is good and elaborate but not sure whether all items are available or not since I have visited this place only once. Orderd some ice cream and a mojito, all tasted good. One thing I found surprising was the mojito I ordered. Ordered a blue berry crusher, but to my utter surprise the drink was pinkish in color.

And the search for a quality cafe in Behala continues after an average session at Bean's and cream cafe . So much high hopes but it turned out to be ordinary .With the flourish of cafes across the city, Behala is the only place where you won't find a highly rated cafe or something you can really trust by just hearing the name . And that's a shame considering the population of this part of the city . But I really had high hopes for this one and I still think of its immense potential . But, for my first experience it was an average one .

¬∞ Location :- If you are coming from Behala chowrasta you have to take James long and walk past the James long CCD and you will reach this cafe just before MP Birla school . 

---------------------------------------------
¬∞ Food :- They are not a big cafe and sometimes the smaller ones have the lasting impression but only if the food is right . We choose to order the following :- 

1. French fries ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Fairly decent French fries . The quantity was okay too . The fries were not over fried , none of them were burnt . It was a decent one .

2. Egg and ham sandwich ( 2 / 5 ) :- This is where it went horribly wrong . It was a double decker with one decker containing the fried egg and the second one the ham . The ham slice was the thinnest ever and it hardly covered the diameter of the bread . Such was that we could only feel the bread and nothing much of ham . It was a disaster and a proper suggestion would be to add more filling . Not really recommended .

3. Special Irish cream cold coffee ( 4 / 5 ) :- The only saving grace was the cold coffee with Irish cream. At a price of around 130 it is way cheaper and better than the ones in CCD and Barista . I loved the flavour and the quantity too . Finally something to recommend .

------------------------------------------

¬∞ Ambience & Service :- Once again didn't seem to be a plus from their side . Very small cafe and ambience is better in nearby CCD . The food that was mentioned above was served all at the same time and after about 20 minute which is not that fast . 

¬∞ Verdict :- Needs to be worked upon and there is room for improvement . Can be good for one-time experience . Still a better option than the overpriced CCD that never guarantees to serve better food than this .

Not worth the pocket pinch.
Chicken in the sandwich or cream in the Irish coffee was almost non-existent. Mojitos and pastas are good. Fish and lemonade on last visit wasn't too great for their prices.
There's wifi and outdoor seating though.

Ambiance is good,but the price is quite expensive.
The coffee is really good. Nice place to hangout if you have enough in your pocket. Ordered pan fried chicken, which tasted good and was cooked in olive oil, so the price is quite a bit expensive.

Another good place to hang out when you are lazing around in Behala. 
Thank God for this caf√©! It saved us when we were craving for some good old cold coffee.

The interior decoration is minimal but has a comfy appeal. And it surely is comfortable. 

This caf√© located opposite to MP Birla Foundation, is a cheaper version of CCD! Very cosy and cute.

We had ordered 3 glasses of cold coffee which was made absolutely right, and one chocolate ice-cream. The presentation of the ice cream was really good. 

Everything about this places exuded a very warm vibe which is a must for a caf√© goer. 
Very much recommended!

The service is prompt and the place is extremely affordable. Definitely worth many visits!

Pocket pinch - 360! 100 for the cold coffee and 60 for the ice-cream. VAT free! So yaaaay!

Super cool ambience and a comfy place to slip in with a gang of friends(and to slip out your money) 

It's a super costly place but caf√© visitors are gonna love it! Please please avoid this place if you just wanna hang around because it's gonna cost you a lot. 

Specialities here are the Strawberry Ice Tea( it's super tasty) and chocolate milkshakes. Do try out the Chicken Popcorn here( the quantity is so low, I could literally finish 6 rounds of it myself). But again, this is a damn good place for caf√© goers.

Visited this place sometime back. This is located in Behala on James Long Sarani, near CCD. In fact, we wanted to try some outlets apart from CCD and it was good to have Beans & Cream Cafe nearby. Nothing special to write about the ambiance except that this place has a good sound system so you can really enjoy the music while you have your food! Coming to the food itself, we had ordered Spicy Chicken and Non Veg Pasta in Mix Sauce. The eight pieces of Spicy Chicken were quite delicious in fact. We wish to recommend it to others who might be visiting the place. The pasta was nice too. The staff were good and the prices were reasonable as well, thus ensuring a rather comfortable experience for us.

COMBO 1: it comprised of 2 pieces of grilled chicken & mayo sandwich, a peach flavored ice tea & a chocolate tart. this sandwich was crisp & yum. the ice tea was GOOD & the chocolate tart was AWESOME. the combo was good, both quality & quantity wise.

Had food delivered through Swiggy.The orders were pasta in pesto sauce and chocolate marque mousse.Pricings are pocket-friendly.

Pasta in pesto sauce(penne)-The description was that it contains basil, cheese and cream.First of all there was no hint of pesto sauce even by visual appearance.Couldn't taste the basil at all.Mostly it was a creamy white sauce.The basil was completely lost in cream and cheese.. they didn't find the balance to bring out the flavour of basil in the richness of the other to components.The pasta was cooked well.The sauce was rich,creamy cheesy.Portion was good too with big meat pieces.Taste wasn't bad..it's good as a pasta in white sauce. But I was really missing the flavour of pesto.

Chocolate marque mousse-This was good.The mousse was light and airy.It was topped with whipped and chocolate sprinkles.But the taste could've been more rich with chocolate.There were bits of chocolate cake in the base but it wasn't enough to give it the desired flavour profile.Maybe a slightly darker chocolate in the mousse itself will make it better.

The place is located on the james long road, and is really easy to locate. It's located opposite to M.P Birla foundation school,and attracts many passer-bies and school students.

It's a small cafeteria but it looks decent enough, you may also ask for their wifi passwords to access their wifi. The staffs are well-mannered, polite but the service is sometimes bit slow as it's managed by only two staffs, so if you're in a hurry you must reconsider visiting this place for a quick gorging..

The ambience is nice, and you can spend your time with your loved ones,the food is really good and the price is reasonable too

We ordered for grilled chicken sandwiches, hot fudge brownie and butterscotch ice-cream with chocolate sauce, all the items tasted good and are worth the money, taxes are inclusive which's a good point too. Loved it, will visit soon!

We walked out. So i would just say that dont go there on a sunday because there is no chef.

Went here on a Sunday afternoon. It is a small cafe on the main street with a nice ambience but the items mentioned on the menu on zomato were not present as they did not have a chef so we had to walk out of the place without eating anything.I doubt we'll go there again as the first time was really disappointing.

Beans and cream cafe‚Äì A soothing and a calm place well suited for long conversations.
=====
Intro + Location: 

It is located diagonally opposite to M.P. Birla Foundation HSS School, James long Sarani. Walk a bit and there you go. This place is small but pocket friendly as well. It has student friendly meal offers too. I had been here with one of my friend. This place has not a very fancy ambiance but quite simple. It is very peaceful and more suited to conversations as earlier mentioned.
=====
What I ordered:

‚Ä¢ Chicken Mix Sauce Pasta ‚Äì The pasta was good. The chicken was also decent. The sauce was nicely made which made the whole dish flavourful. I personally liked it. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Lemon Grass Ice Tea ‚Äì I personally found it just okay. Would not recommend this as it‚Äôs nothing unique as the name sounds. 

‚Ä¢ Chocolate Truffle ‚Äì It was just average. It was a bit hard to break and personally did not like it. 
===== 
Meal for two: 300-700 approximate. 
===== 
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Calm and peaceful place suited for conversations

‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced

‚Ä¢ The person taking the orders is quite courteous.

‚Ä¢ The combo offers seems exciting. 

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Lemon Grass Ice Tea was not up to my expectations.

‚Ä¢ Some of the items were not available. I would request the management not to bloat the menu unnecessarily. 
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation 3.6/5

Food Quality 3.5/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.7/5

Hospitality 3.7/5

Ambiance 3.3/5

Hygiene 3.6/5

Value for money 3.6/5
=====
Expert Suggestions:

‚Ä¢ Work on your mock tails. Large scope of improvement lies therein.
=====
Conclusion: 

It‚Äôs a nice place to sit and chat. I would revisit it if I am in this area and shall try their combo offers next time if possible.

Located on the James long Sarani road, the caf√© can be spotted easily. It was my first visit to this place. The ambience is nice with soft music playing in the background, a good place for small hangouts.
We ordered a Frozen Mojito, Blue Berry Crusher, Caramel Custard and Walnut Brownie with vanilla scoops. Everything tasted quite good, though I personally feel the brownie could have been better. Prices are really pocket friendly.. Hope to visit again :)

Had been to this place last week. Its just opp. to MP Birla HS School. The ambience seems to be ok but nothing great. Seating was comfortable in the 18 seater coffee den. The menu had a lot of things to offer but unfortunately they were not serving fish that day as they informed no fish items were available. Ended up ordering a grilled sandwich and a brownie. The brownie was good. The sandwich was nothing special. Over all not a over whelming experience. But good for a one time visit.

This small outlet is a two minutes walk from M.P. Birla school and is located opposite to the Eastern Railway Sports Complex. We had ordered a non-veg combo, which had two chicken sandwiches, litchi and peach flavoured ice teas(two combos) and a chocolate tart. The food was good, the teas had great flavour, the tart could've been better. The ambience is good and the staff is friendly. They don't add service and vat charges to the bill, which is a plus point. Overall, the experience was good. Looking forward to visit this place again.

Recently visited this place and this is what my first time experience was :

‚Ä¢ Great ambience and good interiors with comfortable seating arrangements.

‚Ä¢ Humble staff. They are sure to listen and help you out.

‚Ä¢ Good food. Can be better.

‚Ä¢ Free wifi.

I went for a brunch with my friend on his birthday. We tried a number of items:
We ordered an Assam tea and a masala coke with a chicken pizza to begin with. The Assam tea was great and the pizza was nice. The masala coke did not have much of masala in it but I found that really good. Though my friend thought a little more masala would have been great.
Then we went ahead and ordered a chicken pasta in mixed sauce which was not that great, rather disappointing.
To finish off, we ordered a hot fudge brownie and that was amazing. I had also asked the staff to put a candle on the plate as it was my friend's birthday and they really did a nice job placing it. 

All in all we were happy on our first visit and we intend to go there again especially to have that delicious brownie again!

Well this was my first visit to this cafe even after being just few steps away from my house and the first experience was not good to be honest. Though I didn't' try much of their food the first impression went down with the mocktails. I had an event to attend but I had some to time in hand, so me along with my friends went to this cafe for some drinks. We ordered three different mocktails and each of them disappointed us. These are the items placed in order:
#Virgin Mojito : The drink was dull and lacked in everything. The mint leaves were not crushed well. The flavours were not coming well and the fizz was missing.

#Strawberry Lemonade : This drink had strawberry only in its name. The flavour of strawberry was not coming at all. It was dull and was not good in taste.

#Blue Berry Crusher: This came in a beautiful glass and the presentation was good. The taste was better than the previous drinks which was satisfactory.

Pros:
** Located in a very good area in James Long Sarani
** Ambience is cozy
** The humble attitude of the owner (Mr.Das). He really listened to everything we were saying and also made another virgin mojito for us.

Cons:
** The taste
** The presentation need lil more pushing on the back.
** The staffs need to be lil more attentive towards the customers.

Last Words:
Just one year of this cafe and a long way to go. They really need a quality check to progress.

2.5/5 (0.5 for Mr.Das's humble and caring behaviour)

As our regular meeting place Coffee den was crowded for a party, a few minutes walk took us to this small cafe with an affordable range of selections. The best part of this place u can try customizing ur dishes. Didnt know that before ordering. Will try our luck next time. I give an average green signal for the fish fingers, golden fried prawns and the crushers that sotheened with refreshness.. Behala cafe lovers can try this place. Their hospitality benefited us with a free tart for their recently celebrated anniversary. Guys try ur luck. Happy fooding...üëåüëç

Lately behala has seen a surge in no. Of food outlets , specially along the James long sarani. Some of them full fledged restaurants, some cafes. This one belongs to the second category. Had been eyeing this one for quite a long time, as I was searching for a good replacement of CCDs. Finally paid a visit last month with a friend.
The interior is quite roomy for a small outlet like this. Comfortably seats around 18 people. Menu is quite good for breakfast & all day snacks. We ordered a non veg combo & cup of Darjeeling Tea.
Non veg combo:
This one included a chicken sandwich, a glass of litchee iced tea & a chocolate tart.
The sandwich was nothing exceptional & shouldn't have been for the price.
The iced tea was not sweet enough although the flavour was good. In fact I had to use a sachet of sugar intended for the other tea make it suitable to my taste.
The chocolate tart was really good. If was warm & had gooey goodness of liquid chocolate. Seriously loved it.
Darjeeling Tea:
They didn't have Darjeeling Tea & had served Assam tea by mistake. On notifying they were ready to change it, however I quite liked the tea & told them that wouldn't be necessary.

Overall the experience was a mixed one. The service was fast, some of the food items were a bit disappointing, some equally good. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a place to hang out with your friends.

P.s: When the bill came we were surprised to find they had given a discount of twenty percent as it was their anniversary month. In any case the original amount was already pocket friendly & I will definitely pay them a visit again.

My friend and me were amazed that we did figure out this place before. Be it food or the hospitality it's five star rated. If you are a cafe hopper then walk a few steps ahead from CCD and u will discover a new shop full of amazing stuff. My friend and me we ordered strawberry shake and lemon mint drink it was both so refreshing and yummy. It was their 1st anniversary and their we're giving us away chocolate tarts and 20% discount. It was a humble  gesture as the are a small shop and still they were good enough to share their happiness with all of us. Coming back to the food fish fingers were just amazing and so fresh and yummy!!! Cheese and chilly toast was just too good!!! All in all this is a great place to go and also easy on pocket. Loved it

Just tried a frappe and smoothie while in a meeting at this cafe so couldnt comment much....nice ambience for a cafe though with a lot of competition from all around cafes....the unique thing over here is their menu which looks impressive, hopefully will be able to give it a try soon....and then relook at the review and score...

Last night was roaming with my girlfriend and saw this place and decided to give it a shot. Wasn't expecting much from this place but was surprised by the food they served specially considering the price which is very light on the pocket add to that it's their "Anniversary Month" so we also got flat 20% discount. ;)  
I had Chicken Sandwich and Mango Sluches while my girlfriend had Chococcino and Walnut Brownie. 
Sandwich was really great but Mango Sluches was not my kind probably cos I was expecting real Mango in it. :p
My girlfriend loved the Walnut Brownie but again Chococcino which was suppose to taste like hot chocolate tasted just like normal cappuccino. You guys can definitely improve on that. We were charged Rs 240 for all this which is unbelievably cheap for such a decent place like this. I am definitely going to visit again and they promised that they keep everything what's there on the Menu. 

PS: This is my first review so I am a newbie to this.

My sister and I decided to order in some food last evening (its too hot to go out nowadays). We ordered a chocolate truffle pastry, mango mousse , hot fudge brownie and a mixed sauce pasta. The bill amounted to Rs.340 and the time deliver was also very less! The mango mousse was really tasty and fresh and the pasta was surprisingly very light yet creamy and delicious. Located opposite Mahadevi Birla school, I woulf suggest that if one is goin to d CCD located nearby they should just walk a few more steps and check this new little joint out!

Located just opposite to M.P Birla School in James Long Sarani is a small cafe where you can chill and relax. You can get a good variety of beverages both hot and cold. A must try would be their lemonades. They have one plus point that is most of their finger foods are not frozen items rather live kitchen food. A must try would be pan fried fish and pasta in red sauce. Overall a place to recommend people.

Located near MP Birla School , this place is really good.
The choco truffle and the drinks (non-alcoholic because they don't serve alcohol) are really good.¬†I really liked the choco truffle and that's the reason I'm mentioning it like more than once.
However , being a brownie person , I still didn't like their brownie because I like my brownie hot with loads of hot chocolate or with just simple chocolate sauce which obviously bean's and cream do not serve.
Anyhoo, I really like this place and I feel it's much better than a lot of posh cafes in Kolkata.

If you have to really visit a good caf√© and you are about to enter the famous CCD outlet in James Long, I would suggest you to walk up a few more steps and hit this joint opposite M.P. Birla School. The place is cosy and comfortable with a nice interior and good music. There is also seating available outside if you are claustrophobic. The menu serves a good variation of dishes and drinks which is a rare thing in cafes. They are reasonably priced too. The service is good. Overall a perfect ambience for coffee dates and hangouts.

The place is located near the M.P. Birla school is a treat to be at and spend the evening with your loved ones. A rather new place with small area space and simple yet pretty interiors. Well nowadays Kolkata has turned into a cafe hub with numerous cafes here there everywhere. What makes this cafe stand out is its interesting menu and the presentation! Unlike other cafes where you get coffee and bakery stuff and the usual burger pasta pizza sort of dishes, here you get amazing prawn and chicken dishes. Celentro chicken is the one you should look out for and the Prawn preps are just yuuuuum! Try them out while taking sips of amazing blueberry crushers and kiwi crushers served in margharita glasses and wine glasses which makes it look stunning! The way their present their yummy food would make you want to forget the other cafes. The bakery section is equally yum. The bus boys out there are humble and hospitable and the owner who visits the place quite often is a charming man with enticing stories about Rome from where he got the inspiration for the cafe and gave us this wonderful place to hang out and hog on!
Happy Indulging!

Perfect place for evening hangouts. I have tasted pasta in creamy red sauce, chicken spanish sandwich, virgin mojito, mango mojito, chicken rosta stick and a lemon drink which is not in the menu card but you will get it depending on whether they are having any special beverages day or not. Well the pasta was ok, I will not tell that one will die if he/she didn't taste the pasta, but I will definitely not say that it is bad. All the beverages are perfectly made, the sandwich is also good and the chicken rosta stick is mind blowing.
But the place is little bit smaller.

Ordered veg pizza, Pineapple mojito and chicken sandwich. Liked the veg pizza and the chicken sandwich and to much, I simply loved the pineapple mojito. It was a really refreshing one. The presentation of pineapple mojito was just lovely.

By the way this place also has free wifi, so you can connect to to the net and write some reviews on Zomato :-)

This place is located very near to my house in james long sarani. first time when when i went there they had newly opened and didnt have much on the menu. Today on visiting it again i was surprised and impressed that they have expanded and included so many things on the menu.
I orderd the chicken lollipop, chicken exsidement and pan fried chicken..it was amazing..all three of them..the lollipop was soft and juicy, the chicken excidement was crunchy and very tasty ..so was the pan fried chicken , perfecly cooked ..i was actually amazed that the taste was at par with most of the "namkora" places in kolkata if not better..
And i am not being biased in this review because i know sanjeev da and sneha di personally as i live next door but they have actually pulled off a great job .. congrats to both of you.
10/10 for hospitability
9/10 for the ambience ( very comfy place to sit and spend some time with your friends.. atmosphere inside is very lively)
9/10 - value for money ( very tasty finger foods and very reasonable price)
I am very satisfied and i'm definitely coming back to try other dishes o the menu..

Bean's and Cream Cafe is a decent cafe in Behala opposite to M.P. Birla. Now that cafes and eateries are scurrying up the entire James Long pathway, it's safe to predict that Behala locals are not too far from being spoilt for choice. 
This place has has a handful of tables to offer, but has a pretty cozy ambience. Since it's a newbie in the city, they've resorted to prioritizing customer welfare. A pasta in cheese red sauce was ordered, to go with a Ginger Lemonade and Oreo Shake for the two of us present there to savour. No complains about the orders, but the quantity needs a lift. Another drawback is the absence of a washroom, which they very sternly need to work on. It's a shame that the incorporation of that hasn't yet taken place. 
Hoping to administer improvements in the days to come. Happy with the experience.

Behala was not so modernanized before...now times are flying and cafes, restros are growing in huge amount. Beans and cream cafe is one of them. I must say that this cafe will give u a grt comfort and ambience.  As beans is already mentioned in the nameplate so coffee is good enough. Chicken excidement will b a grt companion with a cup of cappuccino...

Behala, for ages was missing on a nice, comfortable and personalized cafe, until this place came into existence! I came to know of it in Zomato, and thought of a quick visit, and I was pleasantly surprised. First thing that strikes you is the way you are greeted and welcomed into the cafe. I like way the owner interacts, encourages feedback and immediately builds a rapport with you. I just wish she stays customer centric always!

I tried Chicken pasta in creamy red sauce, and let me tell you, it's the best pasta dish I have had ever! Please try this when you visit. Then comes the Fudge Brownie, great chocolate and nicely warmed and decorated brownie. Lastly, the Cold Coffee, very soothing!

The place looks pretty, spacious, and very well decorated. Well behaved staff and cleanliness is all around. Nice and soft music playing on a LED TV/ Home Theater system. They also allow you to connect the music system with your cellphone so that you can listen to music of your choice. They accommodate birthdays and other small celebrations.

The pricing is wisely and fairly done. The menu card and the food quality is bound to draw customers, and make them visit again and again. So it's the cafe's responsibility to keep the standard of the service and expectation high!

Direction: On James Long Sarani. Opposite Eastern Railway Sports Complex, just after you cross M.P. Birla School on your left.

Wonderful experience. See you guys soon! :)

Beans and Cream Cafe is one of my favorite cafes because the food is great, ambiance is nice and cosy and the staff and owners are very welcoming and upbeat.

Its very easy to locate, situated just ahead and opposite M.P. Birla School in Behala on James long Sarani.

The place is well lit with minimalist decor. A huge TV screen, accompanied with a great sound system is always turned on to a music channel.

The seating is also comfortable with four seater sofas in one row and tables for two in another. There are two tables for two outside as well.  Beyond the seating area is their coffee counter with a display of an array of pastries and light bites like patties, pizzas, tarts, fresh fruits and others. 

The best part about this place is the food which I  believe should be the number one priority for any restaurant, cafe or eatery, and the Beans and Cream people take this very seriously. Since they have recently just opened up, they always ask for feedback from the patrons. They also frequently try to introduce new items on the menu for us to try and revert, like pasta, pan fried chicken (which was mindblowingly yummy in my opinion), soups, etc. 

Even the beverages are very well made and are always full of flavor. The pricing too is pocket friendly. On my second visit, they provided me with a discount card with the help of which a 10% discount can be availed per visit. 

They also have free WiFi there! So do ask for the WiFi password when you go there. 

Service is quick and they are all very well behaved. The only flaw of the place so far is the lack of a washroom but I was informed that it will be ready soon. 

Its a great place to hangout with your partner or friends and I would always choose a place like this over a pricey CCD. Beans and Cream Cafe will definitely go a long way. 

Food : 4.5/5 

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 3.5/5

Value for Money: 4/5

My friend and I came across this new cafe one evening while walking along James Long Sarani. This place has outdoor seating as an option too. The interiors are clean and comfortable. We ordered a cold coffee, a cappuccino, a grilled sandwich and a truffle pastry. The coffees were quite good and the sanwich was good too.  The prices are very reasonable. The pastry however was pretty ordinary but overall the food is good. The staff and the owner are very amicable. We would definitely go back soon.  :)

Find out a new cafe in Behala, James long after ccd. The place is very cosy, can spent  lot of time with nice Mojito's, Lemonade's & awesome pastries. Prices are reasonable & the live cooked foods are yummy. Always I find problem in parking car everywhere, but here is no problem at all. Would live to visit here again. BCC  u rock. Keep up the gud work.
