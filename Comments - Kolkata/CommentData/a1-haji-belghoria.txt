I had visited this restaurant for 2 times. 
Nice place. Good staffs. Good service. Had kebabs biriyani and tikka. Value for money. Reasonably priced foods. Quality is great. 
Only I had bad experience with parcel service. Foods tasted bad ..not well and carefully cooked.. 
Visit only Restaurant.

It is a pure bliss for a foodie to be here. Excellent Mughlai dishes. The Chicken Biriyani was exquisite and the chicken was properly cooked. The Tikka masala was mouth watering and the tandoori naan too. I would recommend all the biriyani lovers out there to surely have a lunch or dinner out here and I can give my word that there will be no regret. This place is an absolute paradise for a biriyani lover. Happy munching !
