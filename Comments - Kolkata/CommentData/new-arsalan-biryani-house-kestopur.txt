I am still wondering,how is this possible?I am still pinching myself to make my heart believe that in today's world still such a lovely biryani can be found at such a low price.
I had a chicken biryani @ rs. 70/- and still cherishing the taste and quality of the such a lovely preparation.
In a round the clock pocket pinching world,I am loving it.

New Arsalan Briyani House is really good, it serves Briyani at a very low cost. The Briyani quality is not bad infact it is very good. Other than Briyani it serves chicken chap that is also quite good. If you're a Briyani lover you can check this place. Sitting facility is not that good so don't plan to go and have the Briyani their, you have to opt for takeaway.

When ordered biriyani from New Arsalan Biriyani House, we were bit redundant whether to try or not. 
Finally clearing our confusion ordered 2 plate of Chicken Biriyani. The taste was awesome. I never expected such a delicious thing from a small outlet like this. 
A must must try for Biriyani lovers.

New Arsalan Biryani is really a wonderful place for Biryani. I went here for a lunch. Biryani is delicious. We ordered their Chicken Biryani and it was very good in taste. The rice quality was excellent and also the Chicken piece good enough. I liked that the Biryani was lightly cooked and didn't have much oil.
Too much pocket friendly.

New Arsalan Biryani House is a small Biriyani outlet serving Biryani at Rs.70 for Chicken and Rs.80 for mutton. For a lunch I stopped by it and tried thier Chicken Biryani. Biryani was really good at that price tag. From the rice to the chicken piece everything was good.
The shop has no ambiance or much seating arrangement. They are mainly delivery outlet.
Value for money.
