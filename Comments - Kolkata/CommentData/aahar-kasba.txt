Home delivery thali services have a signature problem - items are oily, and often the choice of vegetables and dishes are the cheapest options available to fit into the cost. Ahar's problem wasn't this - the meal was sumptuous for less than 100 bucks and the ingredients included paneer, dates chutney and dal of rich consistency instead of its watery variant. 

Yet , with such generous intentions, the meal failed on grounds of bad execution - the paneer was partly stale which is a shame because the rest of the dish consisting of aloo was actually good. Then the egg curry in the egg thali combo turned out to be a greater disappointment - the hard boiled eggs were over-fried, the curry wasn't cooked long enough, and worse of it all, there was no salt, whether in the curry, or the eggs or the measly pieces of aloo in it. To botch a homely egg curry requires negative skills of enormous measure ! 

Thankfully a few good dishes managed to somehow redeem the thali - the rich moong-masur dal was my favourite, together with the Julienned potato fries (which seemed like market bought but tasted fresh nonetheless), and the really freshly made dates chutney. Baba and maa's fish thali was also satisfactory, and the fish curry in light sorshe gravy tasted pretty good as did the piece of fresh pieces of fish.

Overall, it was a mixed bag experience. But with everything priced so reasonable and service being so prompt, I am not yet ready to write it off without trying it a few more times. You should as well, if you live nearby and need home food parcelled to you.

Had recently ordered food from them for one week. But, on the last two days, the fish was not at all fresh. Gave them the feedback on the day that Â this had happened. But, the next day also, the same thing got repeated. Not sure why they would like to lose Â customers - maybe they just do not care. So, now trying out other options!!

I am a regular customer of Aahar & had been ordering lunch from them on Sunday's. Food is definitely typical Bengali homemade cusine & obviously tasty. The amount served can feed two persons for order of one plate, and I really like it.
Delivery service is in time. Side dishes are changed according to the need & demand.
My overall experience is very good

Never been to this place. I live in a flat with other flatmates and whenever our cooking maid used to bunk, we always ordered from Aahar which I had found through Zomato ðŸ’›. They charge 70 rupees for an egg thali, which consists of rice (perfect to fill up a person), daal, dhokaar daalna (bengali cuisine), egg curry with two eggs and aloo bhaja . Their side dishes change sometimes though. The taste is just like typical bengali home made food taste. They rarely delay in home delivery. Its a very very reasonable place to order your lunch or dinner from when you do not want rich restaurant food .

Average fare- very convenient when you're in a hurry and have minimal food at home. The sabzis are not consistent; occasionally fantastic and at times pathetic. The paneer and fried rice are impressive though.

Tasty Aahar !!!
Aahar is in a different genre compared to fine dining. Just like you cant compare Biriyani with regular Daal Bhaat . First one is Luxury - spicy food which you treat yourself once a while whereas later is necessity - needed everyday and has to be simple , tasty  and light for tummy. 
This is where Aahar specialises in. Food is tasty and light. Together with the convinience of delivery to your home. I call it a perfect homemade food :)
