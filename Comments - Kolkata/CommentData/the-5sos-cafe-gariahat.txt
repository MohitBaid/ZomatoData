Discovered this hidden cafe few months back. It is at 5mins walk from the Traders assembly, Gariahat, very close to where the Singhi Park Durga Puja pandal is set up. There is not much space inside, the kitchen and the seating area are in the same room but there's no smell of food cooking as such (or at least we didn't get any). The interior however is quite cozy with small couches and chairs and trendy music playing. Coming to the food, we ordered-

1. Green apple soda- It was very refreshing and
a very good thirst quencher after a tiring shopping spree üòÅ, though this is not the best I've had.

2. Chicken Lasagna - This was just lovely! Very filling and filled with cheese and chicken! Recommended for cheese lovers like me!

3. Chinese Chopsuey- It was kind of a let down. Chopsuey was very salty and definitely nowhere close to being good!

There were basically two people running the place, one person just handling the kitchen and the other person was taking orders, serving the food, cleaning afterwards and also helping in the kitchen. They should think about increasing the number of staff members or distributing their work properly to maintain standards.
Our bill was around Rs. 550

I am been to this place twice. The decor is nice but the seats are a little uncomfortable for having food. But the food offered is great. The prices are reasonable. Moreover they do not add any tax. I will recommend people to give thus place a try .

Not at all it was a nice experience here . visited this small eatery while returning from work . being utterly hungry we ordered two cups of ginger tea and smoked chicken sandwich. The waitress took the order and returned after a few minutes just to inform ginger tea would not  available.we then opted for lemon tea. The sandwich was a great disappointment for us. The bun was too hard to chew and we literally had to struggle with it . also it had too much of mayo inside it . moreover it didn't seem like smoked chicken sandwich  but rather cold chicken-cabbage-mayo sandwich .  I don't expect from a cafe/restaurant to serve this kind of food to their customer.Not again visiting this place. :(

They have charged 60 bucks for packing food in aluminum foil! From the taste of "Indianised " chicken 65 it seems that they lack the Chinese culinary art. The so called chicken in pepper chicken was very dry, stiff, not marinated and not at all chewable. Quantity of vegetable fried rice is very poor and made up of only carrots.

This cafe is situated in the Dover lane just beside CCD, very near from the Singhi Park Puja location. We visited there today around 3 pm in the afternoon and it was fully empty. From the appearance it's a small cafe with good ambiance. The sitting arrangements could be done better because though it's look good but it's really uncomfortable for having foods. Our today's meal includes,
*Starter : BBQ Chicken Wings
*Main course : Hot Garlic Chicken
*Staple : Chicken Fried Rice
The food was served prompt. BBQ Chicken tasted pretty good and this was the best dish served. Chicken Fried Rice was okaish. Hot Garlic Chicken gravy tasted good but the Chicken pieces were not soft enough. 8 pieces of Chicken served but some of them seemed not fresh and hard to chew. So the main course was not so satisfactory. Prices mentioned in the menu is inclusive of tax.

Please try the fish and tarter dip. The hookah was good. They even made the flavour stronger once we told them to after 15 mins. You guys are doing a great job keep at it!

This cafe is situated at Gariahat at Dover lane, just opposite the Central Govt Residential Complex.It can be reached by the lane beside Pantaloons and also by the lane before that. The place is small and can house around 20 people at a go. The ambiance was decent enough but there was a problem with the AC's so it was not that much enjoyable and the open kitchen arrangement added to the pain. Coming to the food it definitely tasted delicious and all the items like Chicken Stroganoff, Bar BQ Chicken Wings were wonderful. There is a lot of variety on the menu and pricing is extremely reasonable. Even the hookah was very smooth and enjoyable. But one drawback of the place is that it does not have any washroom/toilet and also there was a scarcity of change so i was forced to pay by my card. Overall barring a few inconveniences the place was decent enough.

This cafe is near to my college and I have visited this since my first year. It is just beside Dover lane CCD.
I have tasted their Chinese dishes like chicken fried rice and some side dish but it's been a long time and I don't remember much to comment on it. Their choco on the rock and oreo mocha magic are decent in taste. Stir well before sipping the choco on the rock. You will find it nice only if you are not inclined towards sweet coffees just like me.
The staff was friendly. They take moderate time to serve the ordered dishes.

Located inside the dover lane, this cafe is quirky little place to chill with your friends. It can accommodate not more than 20-25 people. The walls are decorated with framed portrait and it looks quite nice. 
Each one of us ordered The 5SOS special cold coffee. 
It was an amazingly refreshing cold coffee with chocolate sauce and wipped cream on top. It was perfect to beat the outside. And since the prices are inclusive of taxes, we didn't have to pay anything extra. 
Everything was fine but I have only one complain. We were a group of 7people to visit the place, they didn't ask whether we want regular water or bottled water but they simply provided us with 2 small kinley bottles for which we were charged rs. 20 per bottle whereas the bottles have an MRP of rs. 10..
We didn't fuss much as they were nice enough to arrange ta tables to accommodate us property and welcomed us warmly but this doesn't change the fact that charging this much for  a small bottle of water is not a good practice. 
I would like to visit again to try some other things and also to see the changes if they feel like bringing them.

First visit to this place today.
Not very difficult to locate.
Ordered Chinese food.
Starter : Chicken 65 it was well cooked and tasty but could have been more dry.
Main course: Chilli garlic fried rice with chicken add on; this was quite well prepared.
Chicken manchurian: Nothing special, average taste.
Ambience was adequately nice for a cafe of this size.
Service was good except that the waiter didn't ask us whether we wanted bottled water or not and gave it without informing.
Later in the bill they charged an extra 20 Rs. For the 10rs. bottle. The lack of communication was a bit of a downer.
Being a cafe in gariahat one may visit that place if you're hanging around there.

Of late too many restaurants are mushrooming in Kolkata with no idea of food and serving etiquette and truly 5sos is one of them.  Ordered for Cappuccino French Fries followed by Ceaser Salad and Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Brownie with Hot Chocolate Sauce to finish....The French Fries made its way to the table after around 30 mins of ordering but the coffee did not. Then after 15-20 mins the Sandwich found its way but again the coffee was missing. Then after enquiring about the Ceaser Salad it came to the table followed by Brownie with Chocolate Sauce and Ice cream together. I eventually cancelled the Coffee....I will never visit this place again.

A new cafe on the block, 5sos cafe is situated between the age old mahabrabhu mishtanna bhandar and the relatively new CCD near dover lane. The decor is pretty, and the food is quite good. We tried the iced frappe and a chicken burger. They have an offer going on at the moment, you get a small burger free with a big burger. There is also an offer on mocktails, but we did not take that. The burger is pretty delicious with the patty having a crisp coating and being soft and juicy on the inside. However with the cucumber, tomatoes,onions and lettuce, the big burger is so huge that it is almost impossible to eat it without being clumsy. The frappe was okayish, there was undissolved sugar crystals at the bottom of the glass. I liked the ambiance by and large. The waiters are extremely courteous and you can almost see them preparing the food for you. The service is relatively prompt. The prices are moderately high. Two frappes and a burger (with the small one being free of cost) came for Rs. 457. This cafe is worth a visit of you are in the area.

Near Singhi Park, this small cafe was our place to chill at, last week. The little place has been done up in a peppy way, with framed, witty quotes on their walls.
Had their drumsticks, which were exactly as one would expect from a cafe. The hookah was well-made. 
However, the chicken Lasagne, in spite of its generous serving, was a little runny and could have been better.

Chose this place to catch up with a friend. Located in Doverlane area, exactly where Singhi Park pujo happens. Now this place has CCD right next to it and we all know how good CCD is. But, this place doesn't lag behind in the race. 
We took chicken drumsticks as for the time. Quite okayish. (Rs. 189)
Brownie with chocolate sauce was a good thing that day. (Rs. 150)
Menu, inclusive of taxes. So quite a pocket friendly one.

So, one evening while returning from Rubi's Grill with a heavy heart and  an empty stomach( we were informed that the place was closed and would remain so for a month) we noticed this place.

¬†I was a little apprehensive about it due to the small space but it was calm and well decorated to my taste.¬†
The service was prompt with not a lot of waiting time and then the food was served. Usually, the decor, ambience, etc aren't deal breakers for me. But bad food usually is.¬†

This cafe surprised me with the great food they served. The Choco mocha, cheese balls, masala fries,  fish fingers; all of them were just aces.
I will definitely recommend this place to everyone at least for the food if not anything else.

The short afternoon craving took us to this place, which amazed us in every single stuff..
Locating this place will be easy if you know Lycee School, or just take the Dover Lane it is located just beside CCD.
Now the first impression will be its a mix of a typical cafe with a touch of lil urban style. Proper seating arrangements along with sofas, though i think in case of a big crowd it will floor area will fall short.
Without hesitating let me come to the menu,
They serves a lot of variety so it will be a hard choice to pick something, we ordered-
1. Mango Soda: refreshing mocktail to start with, no such wonder.
 2. Strawberry Soda: a very typical strawberry and ice drink.
3. 7 cheese style noodles: a veg preparation properly tossed up with veggies and paneer.
4. South American Salad: a stand out dish pf the evening, veggies along with some fruits and diced chicken dressed in olive oil.
Overall, a satisfied stomach of mine gave a verdict to visit again.
Pocket pinch will be around 600 INR for two, and their menu is inclusive of taxes.
A must mention is that try to avail the offers mentioned in the entrance door. And yaa they give you a free chocolate if you check in to ZOMATO.
P.S. They serve you with Shisha too with reasonable price (but don't know how they taste).

It's located towards the end of lane where campari is situated(The site nearby Singhi Park Durga puja) right next to the ccd.It's a cafe cum hookah parlour.

The ambience is a bit confusing.It's decorated with nice posters,low set couches seen in a quaint cafe but the music played here goes with only hookah..that too not very good,mostly bollywood item numbers.It didn't go with the decor at all.

We didn't try hookah and opted for only food at the cafe.We took spicy corn & cheese balls,grilled chicken in bbq sauce and kung pao prawn(dry).

Spicy corn & cheese balls-5 pieces were served along with a sweet chilli sauce.It had a golden fried exterior with sufficient amount of sweet corns inside with molten cheese oozing out with every bite.The sweet chilli sauce had the nice balance of sweetness and kick of heat from the chilli part.It was a great accompaniment to the fries.

Grilled chicken with bbq sauce-It was the best dish we had.2 skewers with 3 pieces of chicken cubes in each along with grilled veggies..topped with generous drizzle of bbq sauce and garnished with herbs were served to us.The chicken pieces were so soft that they were melting in mouth.Bbq sauce was sweet along with a prominent smoky note in it which I liked a lot.

Kung pao prawn(dry)-Six pieces of prawn cooked in some nutty sauce which is far from being kung pao which is expected to be sweet-spicy sauce along with chopped roasted nuts along the dish.The prawns were heavily coated with cornflour.It wasn't much enjoyable.

The major con of this place is the service.It was very poor.Food arrived quite late.And we had to ask for cutlery and plates.It's something to be looked after.

They gave us cadbury dairy milk chocolates after checking in to the place in zomato.

It was yesterday that I came in here with a friend of mine. The place is easy to locate. If you all know the lane of the legendary Campari and walk down. You'll come across this place.
It's a small quaint cafe, also a hookah parlour with moderately beautiful ambience. Decorated with posters and low couches, it was okay.
We didn't opt for hookah but only had food. Spicy Cheese Corn Balls along with sweet chilli sauce, Grilled Chicken in BBQ Sauce and Kung Pao Prawns. The cheese corn balls were good with sufficient amount of corn inside. It went pretty well with the sweet chilli sauce. Next we had the chicken, which was the best that afternoon. The chicken was so soft inside, that it literally melted when I had. Two skewers with onions and capsicum, smoky bbq sauce. O loved it like anything. Next came the Kung Pao prawns - six pieces in one portion with a thick coating of cornflour and also had a nutty essence. But to my surprise, there were no peanuts or cashew nuts in it. That was a disappointment. Food was overall good except for the prawns. They have schemes like if anyone checks in on Zomato, they give one a chocolate. Both me and my friend had checked in and we got two Dairy Milk.
They can work a little more with the lighting. It needs to be a rather bright ambience during daytime because when we went for lunch, the place was rather shady. Service was poor, yes poor. They didn't serve us the cutlery. We had to ask for spoon and fork and knives and even plates for us to eat from the serving plate. It was slow, the staffs were not compatible to handle all the orders at the same time, hence the process got delayed.
This was my take on this place. I am not sure if I would repeat again. Happy Dining! :)

The cafe is at Singhi Park and is right next to a CCD. While the branded chain is consistent in its offering, it is also very predictable. It's next door neighbour looked different. The exterior doesn't do justice to the decor inside. Decor is minimal but nice, ambience is relaxed. The cafe serves quite a bit from chai coffee, tiny bits to big bites. We tried the broccoli and mushroom soup, cheesy mushroom on toast, chili cheese toasts, veg wai wai with veggies and some lemon iced tea. To our surprise everything turned out well. The food was tasty and customised as per our request of less sugar, less oil, less salt etc. Service is good and unpretentious. And since we checked into zomato seeing a card on the table, we were gifted a diary milk chocolate. Small gestures, big smiles.

I was quite impressed by the interiors and the spruceness of this place. The menu is a Lil vivid albeit serving the same Spanish Chinese combo in the form of pastas and other dishes, we had the non veg burger combo and the fusilli, the food was good although the burger felt a bit dry but it maybe my perception. All in all a good quaint place for a evening out with friends.

This place has a quirky ambience, and unique seats. Nice, peaceful environment. 
We ordered for this combo of 1 hookah(Spring water+Brain Freezer), 1 Chicken Nuggets, 1 Mocktail(Blue Lagoon). Hookah was one of the best I have tried, dense smoke and long lasting. The Chicken nuggets was also good. And the blue lagoon was absolutely amazing. This place is a must try!

Tiny little cafe ( as big as a regular CCD or maybe not) located at Singhi Park. The decor has been nicely done. Very interestingly done walls, comfortable couches to sit, well lit. The staff however seemed a little ill informed about the menu. They were lost at times but never rude. The food is okay barring the extremely good cheese balls and chicken pasta. They couldn't make a decent club sandwich. :/ The ice tea here is quite good though. The brownie with chocolate sauce was very basic. Also I feel it is a little overpriced as per the quality of certain items mentioned in the menu. It serves hookah as well. Haven't tried it, so cannot give any inputs Nevertheless, only because of the pasta and the good behavior of the staff I'd probably visit it again.

I went to this cafe yesterday after a lot of hearing from people and it wasnt a let down. I am not much of a hookah person so that was something I was a little afraid of, but it was qt empty yesterday. near Dover lane, beside this CCD, this new cafe is actually nice, small and worth a visit. they have a lot of things to offer however I think some of their food items are a little overpriced considering the amount. however its a nice place and can be visited.

I chanced on this place on a late Sunday evening while strolling in Dover Lane. I couldnt resist the temptation of cold coffee in the sultry heat. The place was empty except for one other couple.. Decor was minimalistic.
 We ordered for a frapp√© and a choco-on-the-rocks along with a grilled chicken sandwich. The drinks were tasty and sandwich too was decent. 
In this age of hookah bars and noisy lounges cropping up in every locality, I was rather refreshed by this quiet cafe. It is a quaint place to sit down and have a real conversation over caffeine.. 
Would like to visit again...

We ordered three mocktails i.e, cool blue,fresh lime soda, lemon iced tea - those two were good except the iced tea...iced tea tasted blunt.In food we had roasted chicken sandwich and crispy fried chicken and both tasted good...overall an okay experience.

Yaa, correctly named "SOS"; totally distressed after the experience. Someone please help this Cafe to regain its threshold. The chef was absent, the only available dishes were French fries, sandwiches, salads and some mocktails. Slow service was the icing on the cake. Interior and ambience is ok but again this happened for the second time at the same place for my friend

Situated near dover lane around gariahat but a bit tricky to find. I found their decor nice and attractive. This place does not remain too crowded, which is a good thing. Sitting arrangements are nice. We had chicken steamed momos that came with a tangy sauce and brownies with ice cream and chocolate sauce, which needless to say was delicious. I super liked this cafe. Would not mind another visit.

Ordered: Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Shawarma

Haven't been to The 5sos Cafe but ordered sandwiches and Shawarma a couple of times and totally loved it. Quality and quantity absolutely justifies the pricing. 1 plate chicken grilled sandwich easily suffices a moderate eater. There's absolutely no way one could feel "there should have been a little more chicken", perhaps, just "a little lesser mayo would have been perfect".
Yet to visit the Dover Lane Outlet.

The hookah and the special 5sos cold coffee was good but the choco on the rocks was a downer.
The d√©cor was surprisingly tasteful.
The staff were well-behaved but need to brush up their spoken english skills.
Not cheap considered they are not a well-known name.
Over all okayish-good.

Location:This is near the Singhi Park place,just beside the Ccd.
It is a small joint which can accommodate some 20 people.The decor is beautiful with very interesting picture frames all over.The ambience is nice, except that they can put some cool music to hide the kitchen noise.
We visited twice & it was a mixed experience.On our 1st visit we ordered chilli cheese toast &chicken lasagne along with some drinks.Though the drinks were not so remarkable the food tasted superb.
But on our 2nd visit that same chili cheese toast was not that good. The chicken ogli-olio pasta tasted horrible & came in very small portion.The drinks were again not upto the mark.Not planning to revisit now.

It was creamy and very chocolaty :D

The cafe is situated at 5 mins walking distance from the main ballygunge ac market and just beside the ccd. A small place with comfortable sitting arrangement. The decor is nice. What i didn't like is that the kitchen is at the same area so sometimes it becomes suffocating due to the smoke. We loved the chicken ceaser salad and the frappe and ofcourse the cappuccino.  Didn't like the crispy chilli babycorn as it was not really crispy. The portions are good and the pricing is moderate. A nice place but can be better.

Great surprises come in small packages and this place lives up to the definition of the saying. Had the best lasagne here. It was LOADED with cheese. Had to wait 40 minutes for it but it was worth it. The waiter had informed us that the lasagne would take a long time because we walked in exactly at the moment the cafe opened. We had some time to kill and I'm glad we decided to wait. Quite satisfied.

Green apple soda that we ordered was really refreshing. But the main problem is the service. They dont know wats available or wat not. Its a cafe with basic drink options but still not available in watever we are asking and that too informing us aftr 10-15mins of ordering.. service was really bad and thus the rating

The reason I love zomato is that it gives small entrepreneurs the opportunity to try their hand at adding to d treasure trove of eateries in Kolkata n gives us foodies d chance to find places tailored to our needs.

Me being totally against giving d too many CCDs in Kolkata , too much money for their unreliable service n just standard food went on d search for cafes to just sit n talk n not worry about d bill.
5sos cafe is located in just d Shingi park pujo spot n ironically tucked beside a CCD.
The interiors r small but comfy looking with the kitchen counter behind u.It can seat around 15 people I think. We ordered two frappes . .cheap. .a drums of heaven n a gravy noodles.
The frappes came in . .took some time . .but were amazing . .I just could not stop n hv been craving that ever since .
The drums of heaven were d best I hv had in a long time . .crispy with d right amount of sauce . .the gravy noodles came in a huge amount but was okay.
Yes they take some time to serve but I think that's what it must b in cafes . .u just don't mk d customers stuff in d food n hand them d bill.
So I'm very happy at this new discovery . .perfect place for long addas . .with cheap good food.

Being impressed in the first shot I visited the place again. During my first visit it was veg pan fried momo and choco shake, while I had club sandwich and kiwi lassi the next time. The amout that was to be paid was totally worth it. Ambience was simple yet modern. Infact it was very much innovative to see the bill being bought in a coffee cup. But I was lil disheartened with the menu as they were unable to serve few of the items present in the list.

** Location : - Ramani Chatterjee Road, just beside the CCD and Mahaprabhu Sweet Shop.

** Brief = Very nearby to my Department of Law, and I have been a frequent visitor there.

** Ambiance = Pretty compact, with seating facilities for 15-16 people at once.
Walls are well decorated and seats are pretty comfortable. Earlier the lack of a exhaust/chimney was very apparent, but very recently it has been sorted out as well.

** Things tried = ¬†I have tried almost everything here, from momos to sandwiches, lasagnes to mocktails.

Chicken sandwich and chili cheese sandwich is marvellous, served with potato fries. The momos are quite filling and sumptous.

But the standout dish I would recommend, is the Chicken Lasagne. One of the BEST I ever had :) Do try it for sure.

The mocktails are also pretty refreshing.¬†

** Recommended = Chicken Lasagne, Chicken Grilled Sandwich, Cola float,Green Apple Soda.

** Service = Fast and smooth, the people there know how to tackle customers. They take good care about the cleanliness as well.

** Purse Check = It would be around Rs.600-700/- for 2 people to have good food.

** Overall = They have recently added some Chinese dishes to their menu, I hope to try them sometime soon. Cheers :)

So went to this place by accident :D ... our plan was to dine at Rubi's grill but the power was out so we opted for this place as it had a generator :D . Nice small place not crowded, apt place to go with friends for a cup of coffee and snacks.

Now I had the idea of ordering a weird luncheon, burgers, black coffee and brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream. The coffee was good not too strong. Now for the burgers, they were not those bun patty burgers that you get in Macd or kfc .... The patty was a little spicy/juicy and had a nice¬† flavor, it was buns chicken patty veggies and sausages on top. Now for dessert , the brownie. soft interior with a thin chocolate crust on top and then the ice cream. 

So, the overall experience was a delight. loved the food and would like to visit again but this time not by mistake :) .. would suggest to keep donuts on the menu , goes well with coffee :D . lovely place

Had a very bad experience with this cafe! went there on a sturday afternoon before catching a movie! we called for a cold shake! we were shocked when it came to us. the straw with it was literally chewed on. on asking they changed it for us. next we called for a veg lasagne which was so spicy that ¬†i could not even have more than a bite. my friend had it with some difficulty. then we called for a corn ball... the corn was not boiled and it did not taste good. on complaining they wanted to change it but we asked them to cancel it as we had to rush for the movie. after a lot of hesitance they did cancel it. the lady taking the order as nice and helpful though. im totally not going back!

No doubt it is one of the best cafes I have visited till date. Located just beside CCD in the HSBC building in Gariahat, it was quite easy to locate. The ambience was impressive. Though the place was not so big yet it was sweet & cozy. The interiors are extremely impressive. Ordered the Chicken Lasagne as recommended by many people who visited here & yes it was absolutely delicious. We even ordered Dry Chilli Chicken which was kind of okay. The Hot Chocolate was something I really liked & yes the Tropical Iceberg was good even. Though they give two garlic breads with the Lasagne yet taking a plate of garlic bread is highly recommended as the lasagne tastes the best with it. Impressed by the staffs & yes all thanks to zomato for this cafe. Looking forward to try the rest of the menu :)

Dishes and crockery items that they serve in are very tidy. Food is genuinely good as per the price they charge for it. A wonderful place to hangout with friend. I wish this place also served non veg.

Located beside CCD Dover Lane, opposite to the government quarters, it is a medium sized cafe with good seats (yes I liked the sofas & threaded chairs).

I went there with my friends

I was supposed to go to the CCD adjacent to this cafe but landed up here. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and the host greeted me with a smile. The place was warm, cosy and empty@ (dunno why!!). I ordered for spicy corn cheese balls and Pan fried Momos. They were served hot and yummy. It has an open kitchen and you can see them preparing food in front of you. I am very satisfied with the service provided and the quality of the food they served. Will definitely visit this place again.

The place is located at such a proper area, not hard to find and also has good ambience, but too much of red light. The food items are decent but not that great. Tried a few items like the pasta, shawarma roll and salad and grilled sandwiches. The roll was not upto the mark nor even the sandwich. It's a good place to hangout and gossip with friends

No doubt it is one of the best cafes I have visited till date. Located just beside CCD in the HSBC building in Gariahat, it was quite easy to locate. The ambience was impressive. Though the place was not so big yet it was sweet & cozy. The interiors are extremely impressive. Ordered the Chicken Lasagne as recommended by many people who visited here & yes it was absolutely delicious. We even ordered Dry Chilli Chicken which was kind of okay. The Hot Chocolate was something I really liked & yes the Tropical Iceberg was good even. Though they give two garlic breads with the Lasagne yet taking a plate of garlic bread is highly recommended as the lasagne tastes the best with it. Impressed by the staffs & yes all thanks to zomato for this cafe. Looking forward to try the rest of the menu :)

Visited this place back a couple of weeks go. Its a really warm,cosy cafe located near Gariahat.
We tried the coke float and the blue lagoon. Both of them were refreshing but nothing special . We also tried the fried momos. They were quite good. But the best dish of the day was definitely the Chicken Lasagna. It is undoubtedly the best lasagna I've had in the city. Absolutely delicious! The prices are pocket friendly, which makes this cafe very popular among students :)

Among all d cafes I have been to till date this is one of the best one ever!! The sandwiches, lasagne and wai wai are among the best I have had in Kolkata !! South Kolkata is yet to have a place which can rival this joint when it comes to lasagne !! Also the coffee is served fresh and hot !! Not a complain !! The brownies were just yum yum !!! To sum it up I must say that there r a few places in South Kolkata which offers all at once: Ambience, Food, Quality, Service and Effective Price !!
A must fr all and would like to go back again if I have the opportunity !!!

I am a lover of cold coffees, and so always search for cafes. I was delighted to see this new cafe and decided to check it out. The wallpapers suited the mood they want to display. The chairs are a bit small in size, but ok. I wanted to try the stringed chairs, but decided to try it next time. There is also provision for having long gossips, by the look of the cushioned beds where you can sit comfortably and talk for hours.
As soon as I went in, a girl came forward and placed the menu. She also presented me with a paper cup,of ice cold water, which was heaven, because I just went in at the heat of afternoon.
After scanning through the menu, I asked for vanilla crunch with extra chocolate sauce and cheese chicken pasta salad.
The drink was heavenly. I am still smacking my lips thinking about it. The salad was crunchy and nice to taste, but the drink should have arrived first. The quantity was adequate, I like the long spoon which was put in with the drink. Most of them have to be asked for it. The salad was filling. The presentation was good. The girl came back in order to enquire about my order. As a mouth freshener, she gave me chewing gum. The price is also very pocket friendly.
This is definitely a place where I would revisit.
I revisited it recently. The same girl came forward. Now I know her name. She is Rama. I ordered vanilla crunch with chocolate sauce and chicken lasagna. Vanilla crunch was as good as it was before. I loved chicken lasagna. It is warm and filling. I am going to recommend more people to come here.

I was near gariahat with my friend and we were quite hungry. So we surfed through zomato and reached this place.

Location- Take the lane beside basanti devi college and walk upto HSBC bank. Then after crossing the bank, you will notice a ccd banner. Just beside the ccd outlet, is 5sos cafe.

Ambience: the cafe has a good ambience, perfect for a hangout- from cushioned seats to chairs to sofas, they have every means to provide comfort to the visitor. The posters on the walls are quite attractive.

Food: We noticed the offer buy 1 get 1 free on mocktails. So we ordered a blood orange soda and a green apple soda. Both the sodas tasted a little bland though the green apple was a little better. I could not find any taste of orange in the orange soda.

Next came brownie with chocolate sauce. I dunno why they served the dessert before. This was very unpleasant. Nevertheless the presentation of the brownie made me mad. I and my friend plunged into it and finished it in a few seconds. It was served hot and tasted heaven. Every bite was chocolaty and i could feel the crunch of nuts in every bite.

Lastly came the chicken lasagne which they should have served before the brownie. The lasagne was served with two breads and the taste was just perfect ! There was many soft chicken pieces, the pasta was well baked. Infact i had such awesome lasagna after a long time!

The lady who took our order suggested me to try chinese which i have kept aside for my next visit. I would just suggest them to improve their mocktails and serve the desserts in the end. Otherwise, its a very good cafe !!!

Located at dover lane this petit cafe is definitely a cool place to hang out with friends ..situated  very near to my house i frequent 5 SOS, often wit my boyfriend or my friends.  Yesterday we went there for our regular evening snacking.. ordered their Cool blue drink for myself to beat the heat..followed by my favorite Tuna Sandwich in brown bread, which was served with french fries and a dip.. my boyfriend ordered a Veg Wai Wai, which came loaded with sweet corn, peas and bellpeppers and a Cafe Mocha. Their pricing is very pocket~friendly as they have priced all their items inclusive of taxes. So visiting this cool place in the evenings wont hurt at all.

Some few seconds walk from my house, this small joint is located near singhi park in between ccd and mahaprabhu mistanna bhandar. Went there with my sister thrice and i loved their warm behaiviour . An idle place for me for some evening snacks. What i loved most is their chicken penne pasta with arabiata sauce which they serves with garlic bread. They have a wide range of mocktails like cool blue, lemonade, chocolate shake etc, among which my favourite is black current shake. 
The overall rating is 4.0 (specially for their service)

Visited this place quite a few times and must say I love coming back to these place again and again. This is definitely a good place to gather one‚Äôs thoughts, have intimate conversations or catch up with some good‚Äôol friends.

The setup is small but not stuffy. The ambiance is really nice: it spells NEAT and SIMPLE. The Caf√© has a relaxed atmosphere and the baristas are very welcoming and attentive‚Ä¶backed by good service.

I haven't experimented with many of the items on menu but still I am satisfied with what I had been served. The food here is mild, subtle, yet flavourful. The sandwiches are really good‚Ä¶simple sandwiches but done with their own style made it worth every bite. Once tried their Shawarma roll- which was pretty decent, came with a filling of moderately charred chicken and mayonnaise sauce mixed with yogurt gave a unique taste never tasted before. They also make good salads, tried their Ch. greek salad and Ch. ceasar salad, the latter one was very well prepared. Coffees are good too and reasonably priced.

Next time you are in Gariahat Market and want to explore Cafe culture ‚Äì consider giving this place a go.

Note to management: Try to provide sugar free sachets with coffee.

Another cafe of Kolkata located in Dover Lane between HSBC Bank and Cafe Coffee Day.A renowned Singhi Park Durga Puja was held there.Its a very small place maximum for 6-8 people.The place is quiet clean and well organized.

Me and my two Frnds went there to chill for sometym.For food 1st we ordered Veg Mono which I didn't enjoy  ,base of momo is not properly made.After that we ordered Chilli Cheese Toast and Garlic Cheese Bread which is really tasty the way the cheese melts in your mouth is really something. Again we ordered a Veg Lasagne which is ok types.They have given us a complimentary French Fries as it is newly opens at that time.Lastly for Dessert we ordered Brownie with Vanilla Ice-Cream and Chocolate Sauce  which is really yummy.

Service is quiet good.Overall its a average kind of cafe.

This small caf√© is located in gariahat area (exactly where the SINGHI PARK DURGA PUJA is organized ‚Äìbeside mahaprabhu sweet shop) . A refreshing change from the over exposed ccd outlets all over .. d√©cor is basic yet neat.. the service is quick and the folks there are really warm .  The food or beverage are nothing to die for but are easy on your pocket. Overall a very much go-able place for that quick coffee and bite .

After the tiresome whole day shopping for paila baisak,me n my friends wanted to chill somewhere‚Ä¶and we chose 5sos cafe over ccd‚Ä¶when we enter the place at 5.30pm there were 2 people only‚Ä¶thogh the place is small but they have managed it really well‚Ä¶the sitting arrangement is quite good n comfortable With different kinds of sitting option‚Ä¶after taking place we orderd for the food‚Ä¶
oh forgot to mention they were offering buy 1 get 1free on mocktails‚Ä¶which made us happy‚Ä¶:-)
now the talk about the main part‚Ä¶the food‚Ä¶
1.CHICKEN LASAGNE- this was the first time i had lasagne‚Ä¶nd it was yummmyy‚Ä¶though the use of chilli flakes was a bit high according to my taste‚Ä¶but it was sooo cheesy‚Ä¶ i'll surely try this again‚Ä¶nd it was served with 2 garlic bread‚Ä¶
2.FRENCH FRIES- i can eat a bucket full
of french fries‚Ä¶:-)‚Ä¶it was crisp n good‚Ä¶
3.RAW MANGO SODA- it was well made...i liked the flavour‚Ä¶
4.SWEET LIME SWEET- it was bland‚Ä¶totaly bekar‚Ä¶:-(
5.CHOCO SHAKE-total yum yum,thick shake as per my liking
6.BLACK FOREST SHAKE- it was tasty too‚Ä¶
8.FRAPPE- it could have been better
7.BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM- it was full of walnuts‚Ä¶i really liked it‚Ä¶

we were extremely happy with the service‚Ä¶though they took a lil bit time to prepare the food‚Ä¶but as they were preparing it fresh we were happy about that‚Ä¶the staffs are extremely friendly and helpful specially the lady‚Ä¶:-)
i would defenitly visit again in near future‚Ä¶

Completely a new joint near Dover lane.. CCD next to this is quite a favourite, but today, while crossing that place for a quick bite preferred to hit this place.. 
The decor is decent and the waiter was very cooperative, welcomed us with smile.. 
Ordered mocktails and both of them were nice.. And the chicken and cottage cheese lasagna was perfect.. Would pay a visit to this place again sometimes soon :)

Another new edition to the portfolio of cafes in Kolkata. Located in gariahat, just beside the "cafe coffee day" of dover lane(rear side of HSBC Bank building). This joint, though not heavenly spacious but does have a decent floor space, with around half a dozen tables and can accommodate around 25person(approx) at a time. The interiors of this cafe is chique with vibrant wallpapers, modulated furnitures and lustrous lightings; the soothing music on the background sums up to be quite a pleasing experience.
The moment you enter into the cafe, the hostess in charge welcomes you cordially and guides you to your table and they really keeps no stone unturned to provide more than satisfying hospitality. 
It exhibits an open kitchen, hence the dishes are prepared in front of your eyes. As far as hygiene is concerned, it is well taken care of, period!!
They offer various delectable savories and snacks handpicked from around the world ranging from sandwiches, momos, pastas, burgers, shawarma wraps, salads, finger foods, lasagnya etc; refreshing mocktails, shakes, smoothies and of course beverages like coffee(cappuccino, mocha, frap√©,espresso, americano), tea,etc;
I have been to this place twice since its inception and I am more than impressed with my experience. 
‚Ä¢The MOMOS are damn succumbing, somehow melts in your mouth, with generous portion of stuffings inside.
‚Ä¢ SALADS offered here in a decent variety and they delivers most of them with perfection; from the luscious veggies used to the fabulous and mouth enticing dressings used, just perfect.
‚Ä¢LASAGNYA- whatever I say about it would not  justify its sumptuous flavor. The "cottage cheese and chicken lasagnya" offered here are delivered with complete culinary perfection; be it the delicate cheesy upper crust baked to perfection, which oozes with melted cheese the moment you pinch it with your fork, the spices used in it are marvelously blended to perfection and the minced chicken used for the base are damn succulent and melts into your mouth.
The toasts which is served with lasagnya has its own uniqueness and compliments the main dish pretty well- crispily toasted to offer that crunchy bite and yet the inner part is soft and mouth melting and sprinkled with splended spices. Overall an awesome offering.
I haven't tried out the other offerings yet but hopefully those would stand up to my expectation as well.
The prices will bring a wide smile in your face considering the quality and delicacy they put on the table.
It has the potential to compete with most of the well known cafe chains in town. 
Definitely worth revisiting.

A hot summer day and we thought of having a light food to refresh our mind .. I along with my friend went to this place to have some snacks and found that happy hours are going there.. The cafe was offering mocktail..buy one and get one free. I choose to have raw mango soda and my friend rose soda.. I must say after seeing the glasses we were excited.. What a presentation of the drinks they served. 10 upon 10 i give to them for the lovely unique presentation. The mocktails were lovely and the mango soda had squashed mangoes like feeling.. Even the rose soda was refreshing . We then placed order for chicken steam momo. I must confess that i thought momos shall have ordinary taste and look like. But i was surprised to see a different shape and found that momos were soft yummy taste.. The pudina chutney along with the different sauces gave it a sweet sour and sour taste.. The chickens in this it was rightly cooked. The place is indeed a good place to hang around. The decor is splendid and the sitting arrangement with different stylish sofas and chairs will make you feel fashionable . A very neat and cafe and awesome place to have snacks and mocktails, wai wai, sandwiches, burger, tea,coffee and so on. I shall give botg 10 / 10 for food and decor and presentation.. I will like to visit this place again. I had a very warm good experience in this cafe. A very good courtesy is being maintained by the staff and management.

I visited this place again  to taste the delicious food..just yummy tasty and mind blowing presentation..the chinese dishes are yummy..chicken machurian and green chilifrie rice combination made my hunger ran way.Even the momos were lovely to taste.

This cafe is located right next to Dover Lane CCD, right where you would go for the Singhi Park pujo. The ambience is nice, though the space is a little on the lower side. The staff people are polite and courteous. 
I have been there thrice and tried out the chicken pasta salad, chicken kofta and the grilled chicken club sandwich. They present their preparations in a tempting way. The preparations are good. I especially liked the kofta preparation, subtly spicy and tangy. The grilled club was really good and they use brown bread, so that's a definite plus point for the health conscious freaks. 
Overall it's a good place and a much better alternative than other cafes located close by. 
The prices are affordable and that's what makes this place worth visiting. The only gripe is they do not have a rest room.

The 5sos Cafe - A really great Non Vegetarian Cafe
======
Intro + Location: The reason why i am saying this cafe as a Non Vegetarian Cafe is because when i visited, they hardly had anything good in vegetarian. Whatever dishes i was asking, it was not available. However, i did get one good thing in veg to order from here. What's good about this place is that despite being a small eatery, they have managed to make it look a bit funky by arranging different seating arrangement and also keeping the ceiling plain keeping the ambience quite soothing and simplistic. It is a really great place for friends and couples to have a conversation.¬†

Located at the Dover Road where previous Aqua Java was situated. To be more precise take the first left from Gariahat More if coming from Rashbehari side and then again take a left in the la and head straight, i am sure you will discover it.¬†
======
Food ordered:

1) Chicken Shawarma Wrap - It was really good and nicely presented. I really liked the preparation and it was somewhat different from the rest which i have. #musttry

2) Veg Grilled Sandwich - It was just okay. I mean homely sandwiches type. However, the presentation again was good.¬†

3) Irish Coffee - It tasted good.¬†
======
Meal for two: 300-550 max
======
Pros:
1) Reasonably priced.
2) Decent ambience.
3) Good Food quality.
4) Decent serving speed.

Cons:
1) Not much vegetarian items available here.
======
Summary:

Food quality 3.8/5
Food quantity 3.7/5
Food presentation 3.6/5
Taste 3.7/5
Hygiene 3.9/5
Value for money 3.6/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
======
Conclusion:¬†
Needs to work on getting more dishes in the menu. Can improve much more with the services. Overall, satisfactory. :)¬†

It was very near to my office so I visited with my girlfriend. We ordered chicken steamed momo and 1 lebanise dish. Both food was very nice. The momo was very soft and well cooked. Only negative is the small seating area, great for couples but not for more than 4. My favourites are
Lasagne, chicken kibbeh and momo.

I loved this place. It is located just beside CCD and it is close to Ruby's grill. Service is good and cordial. Food is also good especially the grilled club sandwich. We also took the brownie with chocolate sauce which was also good as long as it was warm. Overall I am impressed and planning my next visit. :-)

It was very near to my office so I visited with my girlfriend. We ordered chicken steamed momo and 1 lebanise dish. Both food was very nice. The momo was very soft and well cooked. Only negative is the small seating area, great for couples but not for more than 4. My favourites are
Lasagne, chicken kibbeh and momo.

Yes it deserves a 5 point. Writing this review just stepping out of this cafe. It's located just beside the shinghipark CCD. This was my 1st visit to The 5sos Cafe. And am overwhelmed by their hospitality. They have a superb ambience and the cosy & small place is so well decorated. And the food.....it's marvellous. We ordered for cheese chicken pasta salad and brownie with chocolate sauce. The taste was heavenly, pure bliss! The waiters were so courtious and well behaved. Would love to drop in again.
