Still one of the best of Park Street. Pick any Kebabs and you will love it. Good old school decor. Plan your visit for festive season or you might face a high waiting time.

If you see it as a regular restaurant, you will feel that the food is tasty and the service is fast. If you see it as the place famous for its "legendary" chello kabab, you will probably feel a little disappointed. And, either way, you'll feel that the long waiting time, tight seating, and watered down drinks are not worth it.

No need to say more one of the star restaurant of kolkata. Visited here after a long time and nothing is changed awesome as always. This place never disappointed me.

We ordered the famous chelo kebab comes with yum butter rice, egg sunny side up, and tandoor chicken.
Kebab is soft, succulent and full of flavor. 2nd dish was chef's special chicken stick sizzlers very tender chicken with veggies, sausage and liver pieces. Sauce was perfectly reduced a must try at this place and last we ordered a souffle it was ok.

Peter Cat, located bang in the heart of Park Street, just along the alley beside Flurys, is one of the most famous restaurants in Park Street. Known for its unique Chelo Kabab, which no other restaurant has been quite able to reproduce, the place attracts a number of foodies all day long. And so there is always a queue to get in as bookings are not taken. But I must say, the wait is worth it.
The inside is dimly lit. There are two floors and the overall seating capacity must go well over a hundred. We were a group of nine people and so we ordered Chelo Kababs (Classic) for each one of us, a Vegetable Steak Sizzler and Fresh Lime Sodas.
The quality of the Chelo Kabab well justifies the hype surrounding it. The soft pieces of meat, the buttered rice, the fried egg on top, all of the items were beautifully cooked. It was a gastronomical delight. The sizzler was tasty as well, but the Chelo Kabab is what Park Street is famous for, and that is what people should always eat here.
The prices are on the higher end, obviously, but that cannot be complained about when we take into consideration the legacy of the restaurant and the amazing food.
Definitely coming back!

Peter Cat has been around for decades & that speaks a lot. For people from Kolkata, Peter Cat food is as favorite as mom made food. That is the kind of love they have for this place. They enjoy every aspect of the restaurant - From the food, to the guard at the entrance, to the silver mugs they serve beer in to the old furniture, the carpet and the lighting. It takes years of dedication by a brand to get to this level that people love it beyond reason. For culinary freaks and hardcore foodies with an exposure to the ‚Äòreal thing‚Äô, Peter Cat might not appeal as much.

The best chelo kebab I've ever tasted and you can grab this one at Peter Cat (Park Street)..it's a feast for meat lovers and you back this up with super cold Beer to sum up your brunch (Don't try this for dinner, it takes a while to settle)..

A cult restaurant for Kolkata.. always crowded.. if going for dinner, make sure to go really early or be prepared to queue up for 30-45 mins.. i always end up eating the chello kabab which is yummm! They have a vegetarian one is well which is also very good.. they have good mughlai food but then nothing beats the chello kabab.. if in kolkata then its a must visit!

So, I wanted to celebrate my first anniversary with my boyfriend in some place that would be affordable for a college student, is cozy & calm, food is promising & quantity should also be enough for two. The thing that surprised me was the wait time because I didn't have to wait & that also on a Sunday afternoon. 
We ordered three things : 
The original Chelo Kebab - 375/- 
Chicken sweet corn soup - 150/- 
Roasted Chicken sizzler - 285/-
We couldn't finish it off so we packed the rest of it & that costed us only 4 rupees. 
Including taxes it costed us 855. 
Personal opinion - Apart from the soup which was lacking flavours a bit, both the other items were A class. Order was served in no time & the environment was lovely. 
P.s.- Photos aren't aesthetically pleasing as because I was in a hurry to dive into the food. üòÖ

What we ordered :-
Chelo Kebab. House Special Sizzler.

Ambience :- 5.0
Noone expects any less than 5 from Peter Cat's ambience. Comfortable seating. Cozy atmosphere. Exactly what a restaurant of this reputation and history should be.

Food :- 5.0
So those who dont know, Peter Cat is the pioneer of the famous Chelo Kebabs (its a platter), a speciality of Kolkata (West Bengal to be honest). As expected, the Chelo Kebab was heavenly. It was a lot better than what we had in Trinca's. The sizzler was good too but a bit sweet.

Service :-
Thr service was prompt. The waiters were eager to help and were friendly. There's always a waiting list in Peter Cat(Thanks to its popularity). However you only need to wait for like 15-20 mins and not more than that.

Recommendation :- 
Obviously, you have to visit this restaurant if you havent yet. You'll enjoy anything you order. Do try the Chelo Kebabs

POOR SERVICE...MANNERLESS STAFF
Came here with my friends on 12 Jan 2018 and ordered food along with 1 Kinley 1ltr water bottle and I found that they have charged more than MRP for water bottled, selling a 20 RS bottle for 60 RS. When I asked the management, they told me that "MRP is only valid outside the restaurant Mam not inside" what kind of illogical answer is that.

I asked them to reduce the amount, but they rudely replied that this is the regular cost and forced me to pay the total amount more than that the staff of the restaurant has argued.

I would must say that the manager was shamelessly saying that there is no such rule and he has no fear if we go and write any complaining consumer forum.

We were new to the town and came to this restaurant becoz of the ratings... But believe me it is a totally false hype... They waste table space by making lesser people  seat at a table of 4/6.... Wait time is very long... Waiting management is really poor.... It's very slow knowing that people are waiting outside still they delayed getting the bill also !! Very disappointed with the taste of the food specially... Still feel hungry !

Ordered chelo kebab through zomato. Order was delivered within stipulated time, but it was cold. Restaurant should change the traditional paper covered packing and rather pack it in plastic cointainers to keep the food warm. If the food is delivered cold it doesn't make sense to place online order.

I have not have had the chance of trying a lot.
Their mixed sizzler is as good as the myth.
Cocktails are quiet cheap by Park Street Standards.
The only drawback in the queue.Long hours of waiting is a big no-no when you plan in a hustle.

Try their cocktails and sizzlers.You wont be disappointed.

Finally I ended up going to this place after many many years. This place serves excellent food and that is why it is crowded throughout the year and never would you go there and get a seat without waiting. After years of trial, this is the first time we got the chance to go inside after a waiting time of 30 mins that too because we went for dinner at 6 o clock in the evening. We ordered the signature chelo kabab and the mutton hamburger steak. 
The chelo kabab was heavenly. The kababs were delicious and the rice tasted amazing with the generous amount of butter. So the wait of all these years was worth it.  And the mutton hamburger steak was amazing as well. 
So if you have the patience, I'd tell you all to go there if you haven't already been there.

Peter cat is one of those legendary restaurants which is a must visit when in Cal. However to be honest the famous ‚ÄúChelo Kebab‚Äù is a hype. The butter portion is generous to be fair, the sheekh kebab is overcooked. It probably used to be great but isn‚Äôt anymore.

This place needs no descriptions. Its already studded with various tags like "The legendary outlet", best chello kebab in town etc. But well on my visit this time, I tried some other dishes. As always they excel in their kebabs. We had ordered Fish makhmali kebab and it was lip-smacking. Further in main course we tried their Biryani-Ala-Nawabi sided by Afghani Chicken. Both the dishes won my heart. Whether it be your first visit or 10th, while exiting the doors you always think of the dish you would like to try on your next visit.

Oh , who doesn't know that?
This place definitely keeps up with one's expectations.
But the only thing that bugs is the never ending queue  that you'll have to wait to get a seat. One day we were asked to wait for 2 hours and that's the only reason for the low rating. 
Decor is definitely pretty with lamp shades hanging and that adds to the charm.
Service is good as well.
So yeah , I definitely want to visit again.

And nothing could be done about it ... And then Peter Cat claims it to be legendary.... .

Peter Cat needs no prior introduction. It has been a benchmark for all restaurants in Kolkata for a long time now. Situated on Russell Street, this is "The" restaurant of Kolkata.

People standing in queue outside the restaurant just to get in is a very common sight in case of Peter Cat. Fortunately enough, on my latest visit, I did not have to stand in the queue. 

Once you enter, the dark environment and dim red lighting hits you which gives it a very old yet classy vibes. 

The service was quite pleasing. The waiters we're very responsive and our orders arrived fairly quick which when taking into consideration that the restaurant was quite full, does speak volumes about their service.

We ordered :

üçπ Screwdriver
üçé Tandoori Chicken
üçé Chello kebab
üçéHouse special Chicken steak sizzler @ with sausages
üçÆ Souffle 

üçπ The first order was a cocktail named Screwdriver which was a combination of orange juice and vodka. A good cocktail indeed. (4/5)

üçΩÔ∏è Tandoori Chicken was the second order which was very tasty. The meet had retained nice amount of moisture inspire of being cooked in the tandoor. The tender meat came off the bones very easily and was very delicious. One plate of the dish contained 4 pieces of Chicken. (4.5/5) for this.

üçΩÔ∏èNext in line was the famous Chello kebab. It did live up to all the hype. The kebabs are very tasty, the egg poach and and the rice with butter just makes it a complete dish. Peter cat is the pioneer of this Chello kebab and you can easily tell why. Their chello kebab is on a different level than what you find in other eateries. (5/5)

üçΩÔ∏è The next order was the Chicken Steak with sausages. It was a good dish. The meat, again, was very nicely cooked. The sausages were very tasty. The veggies we're nicely cooked as well. (4/5) for this.

üçÆü•Ñ Last came the dessert which our server suggested. The souffle did not impress me. It had a good texture but I felt something was lacking. (3/5) for the dessert.

Overall, Peter Cat did infact live up to our expectations and it was a very good dining experience. Highly Recommend!! :)

Peter Cat can be a safe try for anyone, whoever has been to Kolkata once and wanted to tryout Kolkata restaurants.
It still carries a heritage and legacy of old Kolkata and the crowd just adds to it.
Chello kebab, as is famously known, is a religious food of this place. - go for the chicken one, the mutton platter, doesn't fit into the concept and taste for this.
It's tastes better than however good you have heard about it.
It's a multiple visited for Calcutta food lovers - and hopefully remain to be so

Not up to expectation. Food had no taste, I ordered chicken Irani kebab which was cold and tasteless and KEBAB was served without sauce or chutney. Then in main course we ordered mutton Nawabi which was too tasteless. Had no taste of spices, if a Mughlai food had no masala and flavour then which food will have. Naan and salad was rather good

If you want to taste a delicious sizzler & chello kabab you must head for this wonderful restaurant at the midst of park street ‚ÄúPeter Cat‚Äù. The service is wonderful with great ambience and the delicious food summed up to be one of the best restrau in kolkata i visited lately.

Finally managed to get a seat after an hour of waiting, awesome decor, good service albeit with a hint of pride lingering in their upright gait, bordering on the horizons of snobbishness.
We went for the recommended piece of dish that Peter cat is famous for . The original Chelo kebab, which arrived after half an hour of munching on a tasty chicken appetizer, looked quite appealing and raised my hopes up, but was soon dashed after a minute into the dish. The dish was quite bland , nothing out of the ordinary, and typically overrated. With the side items on the plate doing nothing to complement it's flavours I opted for a zeera drink so that it might act like a palette cleanser . However that was a bad choice, it was infinitely worse than a normal jeera sarbat which a child can make at home. Overall, a very sad experience and the bill didn't help it either.

Visited this traditional fine dine restaurant  . One thing I must tell you that the ambience at this place was awesome and also the service of the staff was quick and prompt . We have ordered a sizzler  platter and Chelo kebab , the sizzler was undoubtedly fabulous and the signature chelo kebab was something different that I‚Äôve tried ever , chelo kebab was served with a mild roasted potato and roasted panner sticks and mildly cooked rice with butter . When you taste it you will feel like you have never had this type of rice ever , it was delicious and amazingly smooth . 
Overall experience was awesome !!  Must visit this place for a fabulous lunch

I really don't think so, this place needs any kind of new reviews or introduction. 
This place is a gem that the city and its people have preserved since years.

 A Favorite place for family dinners, this place is often visited by flocks of foodie friends who treasure their culinary expertise and mouth-melting dishes, like chelo kebab- the all-time favourite and most popular offering from the house.
The strawberry milkshake also tops the list. Which is pure Bliss after a good lunch/dinner. ^_^

I even ordered Chicken Steak _ it was served as smoky pieces of chicken,smashed potatoes, sausages n topping of egg ! It was really amaZing ! My Personal Favourite !

But once we entered, the wait seemed to be totally worth it!
Lovely interiors with prompt service & attention;
and not to forget, the fantastic food definitely made our day!
We ordered the much talked about Chelo Kebab and Chicken Steak and the food lived upto the expectation!
Screwdriver and Bloody Mary is a killer combination, I must say!
A must go place if you're in Park Street, rather if you're in Kolkata.
Reputation speaks for itself!

This place simply needs no introduction...Located on the iconic Park Street...this one's a legend in its field..
No matter how many restros pop up here...the queue in front of this one never seems to end!!! 

Ambiance --- 

Food :- I have previously tried their famed "Chelo Kebab" and have loved it very much like most others...Recently tried out their Grilled Chicken Sizzler and Biryani Ala Nawabi...both of which satisfied my taste buds ‚ò∫‚ò∫


Grilled Chicken Sizzler --- It had 2 big pieces of perfectly grilled chicken with a very tasty gravy over it...About 4  pieces of potato and boiled veggies on the side...My first sizzler and am already a fan...üòÜüòÜ


BIryani Ala Nawabi --- Now this one's a not so talked about dish here...but my friend who's a regular visitor insisted me a lot to try it out ...and Oh My...It was delicious...Yes it was a bit oily...but the taste was really nice...You would totally love it...So go and have it...if you haven't already...thank me later üòÜ

Service --- I would say its quite prompt...no complaits here as well.

Although Peter Cat is supposed to be one of the most iconic and legendary joints in the city,it failed to live up to its hype on my visit. The food I was served was a little cold and I felt that the waiters were a little snobbish. That being said, I thought that the interiors and ambience of the place was wonderful. The entire place is really rustic and I loved the overall vibe. 

Now coming to the food, I ordered the iconic ‚ÄòChelo Kabab‚Äô. The dish as a whole was pretty good but it did have a few problems. I thought the seekh kabab(which was a part of the dish)was really dry; especially when I judge it in comparison to some of the seekh‚Äôs I have had for 1/10th of the price in the alley‚Äôs of old delhi. But the other components of the dish were superb. I really loved the flavor of the butter rice and the reshmi kabab on the plate. Both of these components (along with the veggies) were cooked to perfection and were charred just enough to lend some smokiness to the dish which complemented the taste of the spices quite beautifully. 

The service was quick and professional but not friendly by any stretch of the imagination. All in all, I did enjoy my visit to Peter Cat but would recommend Mocambo over this place.

Extremely snobbish staff, sub standard food, where is that old Calcutta charm Peter Cat? Let me begin this review by saying I'm a generous person. I never critique a place based on one visit alone. But over the last four-five visits to Peter Cat, I have noticed the service ( read - cocky doorman, callous staff) couldn't care less about their visitors, and the food, dear lord has been magnificently average. Our last visit- when I decided to order *shudder* a vegetarian chello kebab as I was in the mood to try something different came stone cold. The *paneer* was sweeter than the rum balls being sold next street. I thought about drowning my disappointment in an ice-cream cola but they refused to serve it with any other ice-cream apart from vanilla (I obviously, requested that I would pay extra for a scoop of another flavor). Okay, to be fair to the readers I have been regularly trying the non vegetarian chello kebabs for a while now and the contents have been bland, cold and chewy at times. The waiter asked me more than a couple of times if this is all I would be ordering. Yes, old man, for a two seater right next to the spoon, lemon, onion stand (regulars would know what I'm talking about) and the cold food, and the chilly vibes, this would be all.

This time it was horrible.  Everything about this property has taken a dive. 
The food has lost its touch and the service quality  is horrible.  My biggest problem is  with the service. I felt like  leaving the table as soon as the waiter  showed up for taking the order.  
Nothing in  particular just everything about him was wrong.
We all pay and eat.. and we deserve a little better  treatment.

Well peter cat was in my wish list for a long time. So we have visited. Now let us talk about the food. We ordered chicken chello kabab, fried rice and chili chicken. No doubt chello kabab was mouth watering. Chili chicken was tasty too.. But the fried rice was not up to the mark. Frankly I was dissapointed about their fried rice chilli chicken. Overall decoration is nice. Though we have visited in festive season so faced a huge crowd. Behaviour of staffs were nice. But will visit again for their chello kabab..

Peter Cat is one of the most well known and oldest restaurants in the Park Street Area.I have been to this restaurant for quite a number of times now.I have a special place for this restaurant in my heart.Previously I used to absolutely love the place but the last time I went there, I ordered the legendary Grilled Fish and To my utter disgust I found that the fish was rotten and it was smelling horrible.It was an absolute disappointment.
But none the less I found their Indian Cuisine really sumptuous Since I tried them for the first time.I ordered for Butter Naan,Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala,Pea Paulao and Mutton Rogan Josh and I found them really delicious.The taste and quantity for these dishes is quite generous.Also their chelo kebab is to die for and a must try.
I would specially recommend you all to try out their House Special if you haven‚Äôt tried the dish yet coz you would definitely love that.It‚Äôs ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
The only con is since this place is located just in the heart of the city it is always flooded with people so if you are planning to dine in there then be an early bird to catch your seats otherwise you will have to wait in the queue for a long time.
I find the ambience of the place quite soothing on normal days but during festive times when there is a huge rush you will find this place to be a bit noisy.The decor,The seating arrangement and the lights are pretty relaxing and eye soothing.

Peter Cat is a legendary restaurant and requires no introduction. We ordered the legendary chelo kebab and grilled fish sizzler. Both the items are considered specialties of Peter Cat. But, with utter disappointment I must say, the service is very slow. Chelo Kebab was okay-ish, failed to meet up with the hype. The fish steak was simply bad with that fishy odor.

Chelo Kebab was excellent. The rest of the items were okay. Ambience perfect. The one thing which I would like to say that one of your FnB personnel came to our table and said in a very harsh manner, " Keep your VOLUME down". So sorry to say but we were not shouting and it is not a professional way to speak with a guest. Please take care of it. Leaving that. A great fooding xperience. Thank You.

If not for the food, the place gets special mention for the ambience. Usually there's a waiting time, but it's worth it. The staff is extremely polite and helpful.

Despite having the rush of Christmas eve, we get our call quite faster than expected. The staffs are really polite and humble. The decor is grand and ambiance is, I found, of retro style.
Disappointments : I called them two days prior the visit and asked if they have hiked in the prices. The staff denied it totally saying that the prize is exactly same as in zomato plus 5% tax. However, their menu card says a completely different story.
Now coming to the dishes : we have ordered their famous chelo kabab and roast chicken sizzler. Both the dishes, I found over-rated, not bad but not mouth-lingering either, but overpriced definitely. The sizzler was of average taste, just want to mention that they don't saut√© the vegetables, they just boil them and add them to the sizzler platter, thus making it completely blant in taste. I found the dominance of soya sauce too much in the syrup of the sizzler. In the whole platter I only could eat the chicken with ease.
Now, the chelo kebab : the minced chicken kabab is prepared with too much of pepper. You fail to enjoy the very essence of kababs. However, the sikh kabab was better than the minced part, but nothing extraordinary. Overall a decent platter, but failed to leave any mouth-smacking impression.
One thing that I love the most, is the pickle that they serve as complimentary, that actually stole the show.
Overall, not as expected comparing to the reviews and rating in zomato but a decent experience.

Visited this place day before yesterday. It's located between Flurys and Barbeque Nation, just at the beginning of a lane. We had to wait for 40 mins to get a table, even if it was a weekday, due to Christmas maybe. 
It was a treat from my bestie. We had ordered Chelo Kebab(‚Çπ395) and Biryani Ala Nawabi(‚Çπ270). The chelo kebab had 6pcs of chicken kebab and 2pcs mutton kebab served along with buttered rice, topped with a poached egg. The chicken kebabs were delicious and succulent. Mutton kebabs were worse than the opposite, they didn't even taste like mutton. Rest was fine, though it was nothing special compared to the price charged. Biryani Ala Nawabi had 3pcs of mutton, a small egg and 2pcs potato. Quantity was okay for two people with average appetite. Mutton pieces were either bony or fibrous. I couldn't even have one. Potato wasn't well boiled. Otherwise, the biryani tasted nice. 
Service is fine. Ambience is quite good. Only GST is charged (no extra service charges).

Another Iconic Eatery of Park street

Ambience: Two storied restaurant with seating area in both floors. Personally I prefer the upper floor to sit on. The ambience is perfect for romantic couples as well as chatting friend groups or even a family eating out. The seating arrangements, to the lighting and even the attire of waiters speaks volumes about the elite culture of Kolkata that this reasturant was a part of since long. The place also serves alcohol. 

Food: Mostly famous for chello kebab and their set of cocktail offerings. The chello kebab was pretty good. We also ordered a chicken sizzler which somehow seemed pretty substandard. The wine menu was very witty and the sunset cocktail that we ordered was awesome. The quantity of food provided was really enough for two people.

Service: Cash and card accepted. Waiters were prompt in service. The price was really less as compared to the other places of similar standard. Parking available for two wheelers right in front of the restaurant. 

Overall, definitely recommended for a single visit at least.

Visited this place day before yesterday. It's located between Flurys and Barbeque Nation, just at the beginning of a lane. We had to wait for 40 mins to get a table, even if it was a weekday, due to Christmas maybe. 
It was a treat from my bestie. We had ordered Chelo Kebab(‚Çπ395) and Biryani Ala Nawabi(‚Çπ270). The chelo kebab had 6pcs of chicken kebab and 2pcs mutton kebab served along with buttered rice, topped with a poached egg. The chicken kebabs were delicious and succulent. Mutton kebabs were worse than the opposite, they didn't even taste like mutton. Rest was fine, though it was nothing special compared to the price charged. Biryani Ala Nawabi had 3pcs of mutton, a small egg and 2pcs potato. Quantity was okay for two people with average appetite. Mutton pieces were either bony or fibrous. I couldn't even have one. Potato wasn't well boiled. Otherwise, the biryani tasted nice. 
Service is fine. Ambience is quite good. Only GST is charged (no extra service charges).

Another Iconic Eatery of Park street

Ambience: Two storied restaurant with seating area in both floors. Personally I prefer the upper floor to sit on. The ambience is perfect for romantic couples as well as chatting friend groups or even a family eating out. The seating arrangements, to the lighting and even the attire of waiters speaks volumes about the elite culture of Kolkata that this reasturant was a part of since long. The place also serves alcohol.

Well, it deserves all that hype. There is reason why Peter Cat remains one of the most popular places to dine amidst so many options in Park Street. We ordered their Chicken Steak Sizzler, which happens to be a specialty there. Needless to say, all that waiting in the queue paid off. The service was prompt, despite the rush. Affordable prices too, given the quality. Highly recommend this one.

Quite overrated and the entire process of waiting outside because of the rush and entering the restaurant to find complacent staff servers in the sense they do not care much to serve you perfectly since they have more people waiting outside.Even if they are not upto the mark nothing changes for the business.

The food is still the same with same taste that‚Äôs only the saving grace otherwise they need to change their attitude as it is a paid service which they charge money to serve you food.

The same old charm, the same old queue.. Waited 40 mins. Was greeted with a smile. Ordered sunset(whiskey based with lime and orange juice), prawn cocktail, chello kebab, chicken steak sizzler.. Prawn cocktail was out of this world. Number of prawns was quite good. The cocktail gravy was mesmerising, was given an additional chili sauce as side. The legendary Chello kebab was too good, minus the mutton kebab (i don't like mutton üòÇ). Then came the famous sizzler. Well this was sort of a downward spiral. The amount of barbecue sauce was a bit too much. The vegetables were a bit on the softer side, like boiled and not crunchy. But the chicken steak itself was juicy and was quite big. All this for a pinch of ‚Çπ1336 including taxes.

This is one of the most legendary restaurant in Kolkata which was opened back in 1960' s. Once you enter the restaurant you will be wowed by the tiffany lamps shades and dim lights and the stewards in their pathani uniform and turbans will give you the feeling of being in some different epoch.
I definitely had to try out their speciality-"Chello Kabab" which was so much talked about.
I had placed an order for chicken chello kabab and a mocktail.
The chello kabab which was served with rice and blob of butter, the tender pieces of chicken kabab,veggies and perfectly poached runny egg.I liked the food no doubt but I think their signature dish chello kabab is overhyped.

I Would definitely visit again and try out other dishes.

Located exactly at the heart of Park Street..If you are in Kolkata then you must try this place at least once. We had gone on a Thursday night but still we had to wait a long time in the queue. This place always remains crowded. The food is always the best out here. We had ordered Chelo Kebabs and Chicken Steak Sizzler..These two are the signature dishes out here so you should definitely order these...We had also ordered Chicken Irani Kabab from appetizers which was good as well. The staff is courteous and the service as good...They always take too long to give the bill I don't know why!¬†

I didn't have much time, so I opted the one dish locals swear by- the Chela Kebab. The meat was so tender, the buttered rice so delicious. Down it with some good beer and you'll sleep easy for the night. I highly recommend this place, and the service.

Peter Cat, one of the oldest and still the finest. It has an old Calcutta feel to its interiors. The best part of it is it has held onto its tradition and has never let anyone down. Its Chelo kebab and house special sizzler still top the chart in the entire city. If waiting in queue for the treat isnt an issue, then dont forget to visit this restaurant. The gastronomic delight in the end would wash away the pain of long wait.

we had to wait a lot outside as is usual on a december saturday afternoon, but the men wearing suits outside were getting impatient as they struggled to handle the crowd, they told us to wait for 10 mins for about half an hour. finally when we got in and were shown our table we ordered mutton hamburger steak, chicken steak and tandori mixed grilled steak in the sizzlers menu. among these, the mutton steak was dry inside and was good but not that tasty, the ither two were really nice especially the chicken steak. the tandoori mixed came with chicken mutton (which was a bit stiff), paneer, veggies and prawn and had gravy too.¬† other than this we also had chicken and mutton chelo kebab, in both of which the sheekh kebabs and the rice were blunt just like the soup provided with the mixed tandoori grilled steak. othar then that the other kebabas were fine and tasty. over all i would rate it 4 out of 5.

Was my 1st time there , had heard a lot about the place and of course chelo kabab !
Went there , we ordered 2 chelo kababs and another dish , and within 1mins we ordered 3 cocktails.
Normally cocktails are served either before meal or with the meal.
The meals came , we started eating, no doubt the food was great, we asked them to serve the cocktails before we finish our meal to have with.
And we almost finished our meals but the cocktails were nowhere, after telling them 2 more times it came and the staff started mocking that we had ordered very late that‚Äôs why it was late.
Most of the staffs from the first had a very negative attitude , like ‚Äú if you have to order, order else fuck off ‚Äú . The gestures were clear.
Food was no doubt good, but I‚Äôm sorry you should either train your staffs how to behave with guests or please hire staffs from Hotel Management.

Had heard a lot about this place, legendary and all that. 
Somehow Chelo Kebab didn't work well for me. It was boring. 
And served cold. Well cold here means not piping hot. You serve a dish consisting of rice and butter and meat and you don't serve it piping hot, a turn off immediately. 

We had ordered something else also. However I don't even remember the name, only thing it was exactly the same of Chelo kebab without the egg. Give the same name then? 
Sorry, but the experience didn't turn out well.

Been there on my visit to Kolkata in December. The dim lighting , the staff's uniform , the cracking sound and smoky aroma of the sizzlers makes it a must visit restaurant.
We ordered chelo kebab, chicken steak sizzler, chicken liver fry and fish makhmali kebab. Mocktails/Cocktails and other dishes were average, but the one that stood out for me was their signature dish Chelo Kebab. It's a must try and is in itself a wholesome platter with the quantity being sufficient for one person. 

Overall , its a nice place to try atleast once, however be ready to keep half an hour aside for the long queue.

Peter Cat:

If you are a foody and haven't visited Peter Cat Hell has a special place for you üòâüòâ. Peter Cat situated in the heart of Park Street. Its the place where Chello Kebab was born. Its nice place with dimly lit atmosphere and classic decorums. Usually its crowded at night time and during weekends; so best time to visit would be afternoon if you don't like crowd. Now coming to the food, they serve excellent dishes and my favourites are of course Chelo Kebab and Sizzlers. I have been there quite a few times and it never failed to surprise me. I totally recommend this place.

Visiting this place since childhood.
Always a great treat to be here. But recently,
for starters the chicken cutlet was a bit less salted but you can add that to your taste.
Would prefer a better presentation for the drinks (whisky, fresh lime soda)
The sizzler was great as usual, could clearly see the english influence there.
Being famous for their cello kebabs so, commenting on that is out of question. 
Tutti fruitty had freshly cut fruits and a layer of crushed nuts and cashew.

A big brand restaurant in park street area. My first visit it was. Much over rated in terms of food taste.
I had mutton hamburger steak and the prestigious chelo kabab dish. The sizzler was nice and quite in demand too. My personal opinion about the chelo kabab is ...except the somagh ( the heart of the dish) everything was yummy. So this is not at all a plus point. But things to say ambience , service , and staff behaviour were seriously pleasing.
And one thing very imp about is the cocktails. I would say the coctails section was wow in one term . I loved it the most.

Apart from the seats we got, I really have nothing to complain about this place.¬†

Although there are certain perks to it. For example-¬†

1) The sizzlers and the way they are served. Hot and sizzling, living up to the name.¬†
2) The buttery rice of the chelo kabab.
3) The lovely uniforms of the staff.
4) The humongous quantity of meat in the sizzler platters (couldn't finish it alone).
5) The beautiful lighting of the whole place .(inside and outside)
6) The sundae that is served as a 'bar' and not in scoop.¬†

I thought ‚ÄòPeter Cat‚Äô was an unusual name for a restaurant and imagined it to be a fast food / American cuisine place. My Kolkata friends cured me of this notion and highly recommended it. It‚Äôs in the busy Park street area, but is a surprisingly spacious yet intimate in it‚Äôs interiors. Red light and red seating. 
Of course, I ordered their most famous dish, Chelo Kebabs. And it did not disappoint. But the star of the meal was the Grilled Betki Kababs. Specially with their mustard sauce. Highly recommended. Even for people who don‚Äôt enjoy sea food.

The ambience of the place is very different from any other restaurant I've ever been to, and the food is different as well. While I've tasted better Indian food in other restaurants in the city, the chelo kebab as a dish was good. The chicken Marakesh is worth trying if you like the concept of kebabs with rice. All in all, worth going once in a while.

There is a reason why some places are touted as legends; this one more than ever. I had always been fascinated by the aura this place has because I'd always heard people raving about 'Chello Kebab this' and 'Chello Kebab that'. Usually, I'm the sort that has never been impressed by anything that is hyped too much and I was skeptical at first when my friend put this on our food itenary as part of our Kolkata getaway last month.
When you first walk into Peter Cat, it makes you feel like you've walked into the den of an 80s villain in a Bollywood film. The previous reviews this place has have always mentioned it's long waiting before you can manage to get a table but I guess we got lucky as we waltzed in straight and found ourselves a sweet spot on the first level. We placed our orders for cocktails; my dinner companion for a Whiskey Sour and me, a Bloody Mary, both of which had alcohol right at the top without being mixed into the concoction as is the case in most restaurants I've been to. When we took the first sip, it was extremely strong and we had the taste of alcohol numb our tastebuds momentarily, only to discover at the end of our meal that the mixing was to be done by those who drink the cocktail. This was before our order of the Chello Kebabs reached the table. The aroma was enough to transport me to the gates of heaven and back as the server began to divide the treasure between the two of us. Most people would rave about the meat, which of course deserves to be praised for its well-spiced, well-flavoured chicken and mutton kebabs which were so delicate, they melted into the rice, egg and butter.
For me, the real star of the show was the beautifully flavoured rice which felt like I was dining with the Mughals. I'm the kind of person that loves the punch of chilli or any strong flavour in my food but I was amazed at how addicted I had gotten to eating the bits of grain covered in butter and runny egg. Despite the rather generous portion, our hunger did not seem to evade us and we called for the most amazing Fish Makhmali Kebab and the Chicken Biryani. If melt-in-the-mouth needed an example to present, these gorgeous kebabs of betki would be it. However, the Biryani was a major disappointment in the name of Biryani with its stodgy pieces of chicken breast ruining the joy one can experience during biryani-eating. 
Overall, this goes down the alley of one of the many memorable meals I will fondly remember when I'm 80 years old. I highly recommend this place for those looking to indulge in the highest mark munchies can make. When in Kolkata, do as the Bongs and devour a plate of these delectable kebabs!

There is a reason why some places are touted as legends; this one more than ever. I had always been fascinated by the aura this place has because I'd always heard people raving about 'Chello Kebab this' and 'Chello Kebab that'. Usually, I'm the sort that has never been impressed by anything that is hyped too much and I was skeptical at first when my friend put this on our food itenary as part of our Kolkata getaway last month.
When you first walk into Peter Cat, it makes you feel like you've walked into the den of an 80s villain in a Bollywood film. The previous reviews this place has have always mentioned it's long waiting before you can manage to get a table but I guess we got lucky as we waltzed in straight and found ourselves a sweet spot on the first level. We placed our orders for cocktails; my dinner companion for a Whiskey Sour and me, a Bloody Mary, both of which had alcohol right at the top without being mixed into the concoction as is the case in most restaurants I've been to. When we took the first sip, it was extremely strong and we had the taste of alcohol numb our tastebuds momentarily, only to discover at the end of our meal that the mixing was to be done by those who drink the cocktail. This was before our order of the Chello Kebabs reached the table. The aroma was enough to transport me to the gates of heaven and back as the server began to divide the treasure between the two of us. Most people would rave about the meat, which of course deserves to be praised for its well-spiced, well-flavoured chicken and mutton kebabs which were so delicate, they melted into the rice, egg and butter.

Visit to this place is a must, when visiting Kolkata. Coming to Peter Cat almost after two years, the things haven‚Äôt changed, the same old world charm, dim soothing light, turbaned waiters and the delicious, mouth watering Chelo Kebabs. We were literary reliving the old times, once we entered this restaurant in Park Street. We had our favorite Prawn Cocktail and Chicken Chelo Kebabs. 
  
Please do not miss this place once visiting to Kolkata.

Though I feel their standard has gone down in recent times, still peter cat is one name that comes to your mind instantly when you say legendary. 
The insanely famous chelo kebab is stuff dreams are made of and whenever I go I just order it blindly. A platter of rich amazing kebabs served on a bed of rice with saut√©ed veggies and a big dollop of butter-- a complete dish by itself! 
Pocket pinch- around 1200-1500 for two.
You're not a calcuttan foodie If you haven't had Peter cat's chelo kebab!

It  comprises of paneer, prawn,mutton ,chicken ,egg and also chicken liver. This dish is really awesome. Another dish that we had is Fish Makhmali. It is just like heaven. The fish is very soft. 
Ambience is very beautiful. Very dimly lit. The total seating arrangements are divided into two floor. Very spacious. Courteous waiters.

Visiting kolkata always includes indulging in good food for me. So went to this place after a long time for their legendary chelo kabab and sizzlers. Dimly lit cozy ambience with couple of cocktails just made the evening. Ordered the classic chelo kabab and grilled chicken sizzlers which was simply perfect. Only thing I dont like in this place is the waiters' behaviours. They kinda have a bossy attitude and will not leave at the end till you give a generous amount of tip and still look displeased.

A Legendary institution and one of my absolute favourite diners of all times!
‚óè Ambience: very dimly lit. A little bit of more lighting would have worked better though. Comfy seating arrangements divided into two floors. Very spacious. Courteous & helpful waiters. 
‚óè Food:
* Love Love Love the mutton Chelo kebab over the chicken one.
The Mutton chelo kebab consists of a plate of buttered rice topped with a sunny side up and accompanied with two mutton sheekh kebabs, six mutton tikkas and a roasted tomato. This platter is a piece of heaven! MUST MUST TRY!

* Sizzlers:
‚Ä¢ The house special sizzler is my all time fav. It comprises of a massive chicken steak which is accompanied by sausages, chicken liver and sone veggies
‚Ä¢ Mixed Grill Tandoori is another fav.

* A pint of beer is the best accompaniment with the sizzlers. 

It's been some time that i have given it a visit. Need to plan a visit real soon as the party season is here!

Visited on 25 th Nov 2017,,to the much talked Peter Cat. What we are going to order that's the first thing in our mind. At last we decided to go for so called famous chelo kabab and fish makmali ..and black level beer for the party to begin. But to be very Frank me and my both don't like the chelo kabab..but fish makhmali was real soft and justify its name properly. Now the another point which I noticed was the service. The good service is kept for the foreigners and for real rich..and those waiters and so called black coat managers identifies that easily. They didn't serve our food. We have to do it. As we were first in that place so we needed some suggestions but they have the superstar type attitude. How can they expect tips after this service.. There were lots of food to watch out for ...so u will find variety and the ambience was good but not that overrated type good. That's it ..

A very popular destination for food lovers. There is always a queue outside on weekends or special days. We went little earlier to avoid that. The upstairs us more spacious than downstairs. The ambience is awesome with dressed waiters at your service. But those suited persons always passing infront of my table and keeping eyes on everything irritated me. Now let me clear one thing CHELLO KEBABS ARE NOT AT ALL THAT MUCH SPECIAL. Yes that's right its too much overrated. Only the amount of food you get on that price might attract people so they order that thing. Please try fish makhmali kebab, its delicious. I liked the afgani chicken also. The gravy was very tasty. Kashmiri biriyani is a Hyderabadi style biriyani so if you want kolkata's one then don't order that, though they provide a potato in the biriyani. But a very good place to visit with your loved one because@ of the ambience mainly.

If you are looking for a 5* ambiance please look for other choices in Zomato, the decor is at least 25 years Old, the staff attire also reminds me of the British Era and the prices on the Menu Card appear to be a decade Old. 

DO NOT order continental combined with Indian, make up your mind on any 1

Must Try's - 

Fusion dishes - Chelo Kebab & Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler

Indian - Mutton Dum ki Raan / Various Indian breads and gravy

Continental everything is good (the bit of fusion touch tastes great to me)

Quantity is HUGE though price is very low, so order judiciously.

For me anytime favourite, only drawback NO Reservations so be ready to queue up

Peter Cat is an authentic serving from way back in time. Yes they have a huge que but waiting is worth it they serve the best food in that area and they have always kept their name n fame equally.
They serve their authentic dish chelo kabab which is a complete meal for one person and except that they serve good sizzler . I would‚Äã highly their mouthwatering dessert souffle with three different flavours.

For the last two occasions I am noticing deterioration in their quality of food and service. Today I found the food not at all good! They tasted poor and like some road side place. The chicken sweet corn soup tasted like salt water and the butter nun was hard enough like rubber! Surprisingly the service is also poor and the most annoying part is, the waiters remain standing beside you after the bill is produced waiting to have tips! I would not at all recommend peter cat, there are plenty other good restaurants!

I know there's this craze for Chelo kabab and rice. And frankly, that's what took me and my friend to this famous joint.

Unlike other times, when there's a long queue, we were ushered in to a table on the ground floor. I did find a bit of a space crunch as the family next to us had kids...and they were jumping about the place. And the tables are situated close together so we were quite worried the kids might topple something on their table or ours!!

Coming down to food, we ordered chello kabab and the person waiting on us was extremely disinterested in offering any input. We had asked if sides were required with the platter, and were basically forced into ordering a gravy dish for lack of input from the staff.

The chelo kabab is quite a platter in itself, and you do not need to order sides. Ours was wasted, much to our disappointment.

The hype I understand, but whether they live up to it is another thing altogether. Not sure i will be going back ...

Ordered Chelo kabab, Dum ki raan, afghan Chicken, chicken bharta and Naan. Also had warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce for dessert 
Chelo Kabab was just ok to taste. Would have been better if it was warmer.
Afghan chicken as well as Chicken Bharta was below average with both tasting the same with just chicken bharta containing egg and smaller pieces of chicken. Basically same bland gravy was  used. No salt, no spice more of cream making it look light yellowish.
Dum ki raan was good in taste but here comes the worst part of the restaurant:
Peter Cat is horrible when it comes to service. The waiter was idiotic nonsense guy who served the raan and the onion scattering them all over the plate and the people sitting near.  A 5 year old can do better. 
Staff is not courteous at all and does not take order or serve properly. 
For the desert they served the warm brownie and vanilla ice cream with the hot chocolate sauce missing. When asked about it the staff said that its just warm brownie with vanilla ice cream. Hot chocolate sauce does not come in the menu. 
When the bill came hot chocolate sauce was mentioned for the dessert and I enquired again and they said that they missed it and would bring it if i want. I told them that I was already done and was leaving so it was of no use now.
After the bill payment the staff were too eager to get the tips for their lousy service and were standing eagerly with their tounge out.
If u genuinely want good hospitality and want to have a good time with friends and family then I would strongly recommend not to visit this place!

Had the iconic Chelo Kababs at Peter Cat off Park Street. It was as if time had stood still for 25 years as nothing had changed since my last visit in 1992. Sadly the wait is now an hour long and in their hurry to serve everyone, they have started precooking the Kababs so by the time they get to you, they are no longer hot and melt in your mouth soft. I ordered and my plate arrived in less than 5 minutes and everything on the plate was hard and cold. If you do visit, insist on waiting 30 minutes to get hot and fresh Kababs.Even the staff has grown completely indifferent, sad!!!

Excellent food, beyond words, actually. We had Chelo Kababs, one each, and trust me, it was a challenge to complete. Plus, for starters, we shared shrimp cocktails. Lovely ambience, although I could use a little more light and a bit more comfortable seating. But tgreat food covers up for everything, doesn't it?

This restaurant inaugurated in the 1960s in the heart of Park St. The elite people mostly visited here to have the legendary Chelo Kebab. This Indo- Persian enticing platter of 2 kinds of kebabs and butter rice with sliced capsicum and tomatoes will always be savoury and rich.

Visited peter cat on two ocassions. Had to queue up both times to get a seat. Tried the chello kebab the first time and on the second ocassion we ordered naans with chicken/veg side dishes. Must say the food and drinks were average and me and my wife were really disappointed.

Chelo kebabas like no other and even on a busy sunday afternoon, Peter Cat does not disappoint. We ordered spring chicken soup, which wasn't bad but wasn't top class either  and the fact that it was served in shabby steel cups didn't impress us. However the fried fish served with fries and boiled veggies was a winner. Although it was meant to be a starter with the soup, it came only with our mains which should not have happened despite our instructions. Apart from the chelo kebabs, we ordered a chicken steak sizzler and a keema matar and tandoori roti. My family ordered a tuti fruti and a vanilla icecream which was pretty decent as well. Peter Cat is one of the mainstays in Park Street and we aren't surprised why.

I would say this is the perfect example of a restaurant serving a Anglo Indian menu. I consider an Anglo Indian dish one that has a perfect blend of Indian food influenced by the Raj. The chelo kebab platter is the perfect example. I tried the mutton one which is basically two mutton seekh kebabs and a few chicken kebabs served with a bed of buttered rice with a sunny side up egg on the top. A combination you would only find in a restaurant serving true Anglo Indian cuisine. The cocktails are old world the Bloody Mary was good! The dessert at the end the caramel custard was also traditional like you would encounter at any Raj era Club. Overall I like Peter Car with its charming old world interior that has evolved over the years and atmosphere that you will never find in any modern joint! Don‚Äôt miss it if you visit Kolkata!

I have lived in Kolkata for two years during my post graduation days, but somehow never managed to visit the famous name on Parkstreet, Peter Cat. However, recently courtesy work I traveled and stayed a night in this beautiful city of joy and decided to finally go visit this place for a delicious meal! But, alas I was disappointed to say the least. 
- Ambience was the only good thing
- Service was poor, with servers being borderline ignorant and just so uninterested in their job
- Food was below average (Continental being slightly better than Indian) 
- Drinks were just decent enough
Would not recommend this to anybody, definitely not for North Indian (type of) food!

Located at the heart of the city, which is Park street, you have wait in the long queue to get inside this place which offers a wide range of good quality food. It is worth the price. Always have an amazing experience whenever I visit this place. Their special dishes being the legendary Chelo Kebabs and the sizzling hot Sizzlers are really exotic. Not so pocket friendly but a visit is a must whenever you are in the City of Joy :)) Photos of Baked Bhetki fish and Chelo Kebabs have been added- take a look :))

Well i had heard a lot about this place and wanted to experience for myself what the hype is all about. So i had a layover in Kolkata and went down to check it out. The ambiance is nice, gives you that old world charm with the servers dressed in some Persian looking outfit. When it came down to service and food it was totally messed up. I mean reading all the reviews over here seems like people actually have no idea what kebabs are all about. The famous chelo kebab was a total downer. Dry and hard kebabs with BURNT veggies and some rice stirred in butter on the side. I mean my local meat shop guy here in Delhi gives thousand times better ready to make kebabs than this pathetic excuse for the same. And the servers had this grumpy look all over their faces which made the place seem very sad and gloomy. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to try anything more. The only plus would be that prices are reasonable. Thats about it and id suggest you try other places to know how kebabs should taste like, Or head down to Delhi for the real deal üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª

Once you step inside this place, you feel like you're now a part of the Indian colonial period. This place even today preserve that old world charm amidst the most modern corner of Kolkata i.e. Park Street. For so many years Peter Cat has become the part and parcel of every foodie Kolkatans. The dimly lit hanging lights, the carpets, the wooden stairs, the wooden furniture, the waiters dressed up in turbans and white kurta-payjama creates some kind of an old-school trance. 
Coming to the food, we ordered the very famous chelo kebab, beckty muniere, grilled chicken sizzler and for a bit of freshness, the fresh lime soda. Though chelo kebab sounds synonymous with Peter Cat what really took my breathe away was the beckty muniere. The creamy, soft and fleshy fish was 'oh-so-heavenly'. The sizzler was great. The chelo kebab was yummy too and it is a full meal. The service is real quick. 
Peter Cat never goes out of a foodie's list but it becomes more and more close to the heart.

Staff is rude and unprofessional. They probably know misbehaving with one customer won't lower their sales. Wouldn't go if the Chelo Kebab wasn't so good. They need to hire better staff. Getting a 'legendary' status doesn't give them to license to do mistreat customers.

Only thing to highlight- why were the staffs 'asking' for tip? I have no idea..usually I don't pay extra service tax or tip after paying GST .. well as it was festival season it's relatable.. otherwise i don't find any reason for 'asking' tip!!

Looks almost like Mocambo, the place is spacious and has a colonial charm. Unfortunately the food was not as per my expectations. The chicken asparagus soup had no asparagus. The chelo kebab was nothing close to the hype around it. I think these places need to really up the quality of food and innovate because they've been running only because of the old time fame that they had earned.

Been to this restaurant numerous times but never got around to writing a review. Always though that since so much is already written about this place, do I have anything new to add ? Anyways, just for the record, here is my take.

Every major city has a few restaurants which become much more than normal eateries, they become institutions. They become part of its social and cultural fabric, they become part of its history. This is one such place. The decor of this place which exudes a quiet elegance, the servers dressed in kurtas and turbans displaying a bit of an attitude, all are a throwback to the colonial times. When a restaurant has built up such a large fan base, when a restaurant fills all its tables day in and day out for decades, you know that they are doing something right. You know that they have hit a sweet spot and is delivering food of a certain standard at a price point which is just right for the city. I have tried a large number of items from the menu including the famed chelo kebab. This one dish with its mix of chicken and mutton kebabs served along with rice with a dollop of butter and a fried egg on top¬† exemplifies what I said about this restaurant.¬† It offers a wholesome meal at a reasonable price point. It offers a great value for money. This is the reason why the guests keep coming back again and again.

My friend took me to this place and told me this place is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata believed to be from the times of British. I had Chelo kebab I can't pen down the taste, it was something out if this world üåé. A combo of multiple food options in one plater. Fresh mutton kebabs, tandoori chicken üçó, rice üçö and Omelet üç≥ I wanted to stop as I was all bloated but I couldn't. 
A must visit place if you're planning a trip to Kolkata..

We have visited this place a number of times. The ambience is good and very similar to mocambo. The waiters were impolite and arrogant till recently. However, few days ago when we visited we found them quite well behaved. The seating arrangement is more comfortable in the upper floor.  We had their chelo kebab which was good. I however did not much like their prawn cocktail. The prawn pieces were very few and the quantity was too less. The mutton biriyani here is unique with a mild and different flavour. The quantity is ample with 2 pieces of aloo and 3 pieces of mutton which were well cooked and tender. The mocktails here are also good.

Peter Cat belongs in the Legendary Collection of Kolkata. It's been here for so long now and is still one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Peter Cat is my constant whenever I visit Kolkata. The Chelo Kebab reminds me of home. The succulent Chicken Malai Tikka and the juicy Mutton Keema Kebab. The buttered rice with egg - it all reminds me of my childhood. 
If anyone is ever visiting Kolkata and wants to go out for dinner. This is the the go to place. 
The waiiting line has never decreased in this place. And never will ! 
The food ofcourse is legendary , the Chelo Kebab, the Irani Kebab, sizzlers and the Indian Main course. Everything shines. The service is top knot. 
But this time when I visited , I was disappointed with the cold dishes served to me. They were replaced soon enough with hot fresh ones, but yes I was disappointed. 
The ambiance is iconic- the dim lights, the low lying lamps - nothing has changed over the years. 
Highly recommended to anyone in Kolkata!

Frankly. . Can‚Äôt rate this outlet below 5‚Ä¶ Really no point to deduct any points. Perfect place to have chelo kebab platter in the city. No other restaurant had ever matched with the quality and taste. No doubt in quality. Quality is just perfect and taste is perfect. No flaws. Really worth for money.

Peter cat has always been at the top of the bucket list whenever it came to dining out. But as they say, getting to the top is easier than maintaining the success. The quality, the attitude of the team and the management as a whole has boiled down to a pile of disaster. The ever-so-famous chelo kebab was served stale. It was at least 4-5 days old. The dish is without an aota of doubt microwaved. On enquiring about the same with the server, I was clearly asked to not create an issue and eat what was served. I mean guys, are you guys living in a bubble? You‚Äôll actually feel that you‚Äôll can do anything, having no regards for anything? 
Peter Cat, your end is near!

3. Drinks are available but costlier side.

Its a pleasure to have their signature food named chelo kabab and i was amassed to see the quantity but trust me it fit the stomach quite nicely and even regret ordering some more item as i was lonely wanderer. For the taste the chciken part was amazing with the tomato and rice feels your taste bud in no time and yes the butter cube and the egg makes it a perfect food to carve for. I heard of it many times and after having the dish i understood why they say its their signature food. Apart from this i ordered a roast chicken sizzler but i would say the sizzler have lots to improve especially the boneless part was not upto the mark but the small leg piece was kind of good.

Visited this place last week... but according to reviews and all other stuffs I didn't find the place that good... speaking of food ah yes I had chello kabab it was nice but the rice given in that dish had a peculiar smell I don't why ... then coming to sizzler it was good but not that much as it was cooked not to that instant... ambience was the only thing I loved there and service was very slow so recommended is to have ample time of 2 hours  before visiting...

It was a special Sunday on which we visited this "Old Timer". We had to wait 45 minutes to get our table.
We were nicely greeted by the staffs. Everything was tickety-boo. Everything. The management is really efficient and affable.
We ordered Fish Makhmali as starter and Lime Soda(although it is not in the menu). In mains we ordered Chello Kebab, Butter naan and Chicken Shahnawaz. The last one was a maiden try. The thick gravy of this chicken item was made with minced mutton. As I don't like mutton,I didn't like that but my friends enjoyed it(according to them). The other dishes were really toothsome.

Conclusion: One should definitely pay a visit here to enjoy the lipsmacking dishes in reasonable price.
Rs 550-600 per person.

Outside your city and hunting for something good and different, checking the ratings and witnessing the extra ordinary things this city has.

Been to Peter Cat yesterday and it was a wonderful experience, tried the signature dish veg chelo Kabab which was a mixture of finest ingredients, flavour, aroma, Taste and appearance with perfect texture, well roasted Kabab, perfectly dissolved with ingredients, combination with Butter Rice which was perfectly matching for taste buds, thanks for a good experience.

Hope to come back for more soon.

All the dishes we tried were excellent.
Yes Chicken Sizzler and Chelo Kebab were surely ordered but apart from that we ordered for FISH MAKHMALI( recommended ) and CHICKEN IRANI KEBAB for starters and Palak Paneer along with some Naan and Pineapple Raita for main course.
The food, ambience and service was very pleasing.

Coming to the food, we just ordered cream of chicken asparagus soup and the legendary chelo kebab along with cocktails. It tasted really good and it was perfectly cooked, presentation was also nice.

Location. Perfect. Ambience. Perfect. Food quality. Perfect. That is Peter Cat. Their evergreen Chelo Kebab is mouthwateringly delicious. The generous dollops of butter in the rice make it taste just so good. The Dum-ki-Raan along with Naan is a burst of flavours. A great place where you can have amazing sizzlers and enjoy the old Calcuttan charm.

Peter cat is one of Kolkata's most well known restaurants, well known for their quality of food and this legacy is carried on good for generations. We ordered Chicken shahi korma and kabuli naan. If tasted individually, both were delicious. But the combination was not particularly a good idea. One kabuli naan is enough for two people. It has a royal flavour to it. Ambience and service was good. And unlike the popular opinion, I found this place reasonable enough.

Visiting the food heaven called Kolkata for just one day, your torn between the myriad choices - which famous place or which cuisine to prioritise over the other. So for my first meal in the city, I chose Peter Cat - such a unique name for a place famous for serving kebabs!

Unfortunately I was alone and couldn't try all the different dishes on the menu. So ordered what they are most famous for, the Chello kebabs.... And were they delicious. How melt-in-the-mouth could that chicken be! That plate has me craving for more. I'm not sure if pictures do enough justice but the foodie in me is salivating again!

Next time gotta try their chicken steak sizzler, another highly recommended pick from the menu.

Last time i went there it was ashtami midnight. We just waited for 15 min and we could manage a table for four people. It is a crucial day and we were surprise to see the food quality was as good as during the normal day. 
This is the way they keep their brand name ontrack. 
In a usual way we ordered classic chelo kabab , liver fry and a mocktail. Liver fry was delicious and chelo kabab is one of its kind. 
A highly recommended place in any day of the year .

We ordered 1 Mutton Hamburger steak sizzler, 1 grill tandoori platter sizzler, 1 chole kabab. Thumbs up for the presentation. Thumbs down for the taste. Really upset that the taste was not even close to the mark. The mutton hamburger sizzler was a 3/5. Rest of them tata bye bye..

Have been coming here since forever I suppose. The Chelo Kebab platter and the sizzler are indispensable. They've managed to preserve its flavour till this day and I do not feel tempted to try out these two anywhere else. As usual, the kebab platter and the sizzler lived upto its reputation yesterday. We had also ordered chicken Irani Kebabs which tasted unique and flavourful. The Reshmi butter masala was@ cooked well too. Peter Cat is hardly a let down either in terms of food or service.

Chello kebab their signature dish still is great and one should certainly try it.
Sorry to write the taste of other chicken kebabs was not as per expectation. Seems there has been a fall in the taste and quality.
A great place to have food and one of the best in kolkata this they should take care of their reputation

4 of us had a wonderful lunch today  of chello kebabs...from my previous teen daughter to my mother, all loved it including me. I'd visited this place last, perhaps 25 years back, and the food still tastes wonderful. What brought the rating down we're primarily 2 things - the wait time for a naan (almost 15 mins) which we ordered in between and seekh kebab (another 15 odd mins), which was a takeaway... But the real dampener was when the gentleman waiting our table reminded me that he was expecting a tip as 'service charge is not included in the Bill'. While the service chg not being included was indeed a welcome, but the blatant asking for money was a big let down, unbecoming of an August institution of the city. I hope the owners take cognizant of this. However, this is a highly recommended place for food, and should be on the radar of tourists and locals

While you want to give it 5 out of 5 stars for its food, the parameter where it really lacks is its staff's service and customer satisfaction. I have found the staff to be rude so many times that I have now lost count. Well, just go there for your Chelo Kabab or your sizzlers and don't expect too much customer satisfaction. Food - 5/5. Ambiance - 4.5/5. Location - 4.5/5. Staff - 0.5/5.

Extremely crowded on a Sunday evening and it's surprising that despite its age old legacy, the staff are just not prepared to handle such crowds. We were led up the stairs by a staff who suddenly disappeared leaving us standing in the middle of nowhere. Another person gave us a seat, only minutes later a different waiter asked us to get up and took us to another table. Once we were settled in we ordered a mojito, pineapple blossom and mutton shammi kabab. We also ordered the mandatory Chelo kabab and the house special Sizzler. Zero complaints about the food- the place totally lives up to its reputation. However it was the first time in my life that a waiter refused to serve the sizzler on our plates when we requested him to do so saying that the rule was "self-service". So, though the staff behavior was not appealing, wait time was awful, ambience was noisy and decor was worn out, would still recommend it because of the reasonable pricing and the marvellous food.

Reviewing one of the iconic foodstations of kolkata and honestly its it doesnt need any introduction the name is a brand itself 
Located just opposite to the kfc parkstreet 
We ordered their signature chello kebab , chicken sizzler and prawn cocktail

Chello kebab is absolute stunner its a whole meal comes with butter rice mutton seekh kabab chicken keshmi kebab and some roasted veggies ( onions capsicum )
True to its taste taste was the prawn cocktail and chicken sizzer

This is one of the oldest restaurant in kolkata. It's a very crowded restaurant irrespective of weekday or weekend. It's easyly locatable being situated adjacent to Fluris. In the weekend it is suggested to go for it by booking a table as because the rush is unthinkable. The service is very quick.
We order their signature dish chelo kebab,fish makhmali, chicken steek sizzler.
Chelo kebab : it has got motton and chicken kebabs,one egg poach,salad, one grilled tomato and basmati rice with butter cubes. One plate is enough for one.
Fish makhmali : it contains 5 pieces of fish kebab with some salad.The item is solid but melt in mouth immediately and it's not spicy at all. I love the dish.
Chicken steek sizzler : it comes with some salad,veggies,one egg poach, two piece of chicken, some french fries deeped in red sauce. It's served on a hot tawa.

We went with a lot of expectations but faced great disappointment. We ordered paneer tikka, butter chicken  and naan. The service was worse and the food was the worst. Leave the food, they could not even prepare a lime soda properly. Would not recommend anyone as it isn't worth the hype.

Well there's nothing more to explain about the very famous Peter Cat. If somebody wants to have a taste of real kabab or sizzler definitely he/she should have a visit to Peter Cat. Ambience, food quality and the service all are quite okay to deal with. 

The mouth-watering sizzlers are the must try along with the famous Chelo Kabab.

This place provide one of the best chelo kebab in my City of Joy, Kolkata. The food starting from fish starter to chicken starter with some cocktails and mocktails are really awesome and refreshing. The fish malai kebab must be a special mention in the menu and it is a must try. After that comes the PETER CAT special chelo kebab main course which was again the best of all. 
The ambiance and service was really good. There were attendents always available beside the your table. The place is usually busy at night from 8'o clock in the weekends or holidays. This place has wheelchair accessible and each and every staff in this restaurant are very helpful. 
Last not the least, the taste of their food are really awesomely delicious. I will recommend, whosoever, is reading this review to try their chelo kebab at once. It is a must try one.
Cheers.

I have been to Peter Cat multiple times. I am a great admirer of the ambience and food that Peter Cat offers. However in my last visit around 6 months back, I was unsatisfied with the quality of food served. I guess it might be due to the fact I went late.. around 9.30 pm. I sincerely hope mine was a one of case as there are many nostalgic memories I have around this place.

Full house & waiting is a common thing over here be it week day or weekend & that the best feedback for any restaurant.

My all time favourite there is ofcourse the chelo kebab platter and never have i found anything bad in their food. Just that the behaviour of the stafc there can be improved. At this time when customer satisfaction is the key, they really need to buckle up.

Finally a visit to peter cat!

Shifted recently to Hyderabad, I regretted not tryng this gem. So this post pujo, a visit to peter cat.

Centrally located in park street opppsite to park street KFC, this place serves Indian and Continental cuisines.
@
When you enter the restaurant, you get that authentic feeling. The staffs are very courteous.

We were two, got a good place view wise. The lampshades were eyecatching.

Now coming to the food, ordered chello kebab and chicken steak sizzler.

Chello kebab: Awesomeness served. You get kebabs, egg, buttered riceand veggies. One can hardly eat the whole thing.

Chicken Steak Sizzler: it was perfectly served to the table with the steam coming out of the dish. The chicken breasts were tendered , the carrots were well cooked and the beans melted in the mouth.

We were so full, that we didn't order anything in desert.

Ambience:5/5
Food:4.5/5
Staffs:5/5

If you are in Kolkata, leave everything go and try this place.

Everyone of us grew up hearing the name of this legendary restaurant and its awesome food especially the Chello Kebabs. Well indeed it lives upto its name. Wonderful interiors with dim lights create a perfect ambience. Staff members are very helpful and courteous. I personally felt that food was a bit hyped and frankly speaking a little overpriced too. I hope they improve their food quality in future.

This old school restaurant in the heart of park street is very hyped, cause I found the place to be at best 3/5.
You are greeted to a fine dining ambiance with decked up waiting staff and the furniture is pristine, but where the wow factor is missing is in the food.
The sweet corn soup lacked taste and was bland at best.
We ordered vegetable kabab which were well cooled but had too much garam masala in them. The fish mankhanwala was bland and not juicy, no taste as such.
Main course was veg and non veg chelo kabab which was the saving grace. It was really yum. Everything on the platter was good, from the rice to the paneer and filled potato on top.
So, if anyone wants to go to peter cat, order the chelo kababs and thats about it.

I have been to Peter Cat dozens of times over the last decade. My absolute go-to restaurant on Parkstreet is Barbq and Peter Cat! I love the Chelo Kabab and order it almost every time that I'm there. I love the ambience, the red, having lamp lighting and the vibes of this evergreen restaurant on Parkstreet. Your will usually find a long waiting time during most evenings and whenever there is a festival in Kolkata. But it's worth the wait, trust me! I might be a bit biased, but hey, do try the Kababs and you'll know what I mean!!

One of the most legendary restaurants at the heart of the city, Peter Cat keeps up its promise to deliver amazing food at a decent price. 
Trying out the chelo kabab should be a must. Its a wholesome mean altogether. But if you are the blessed with a hearty appetite then dig in to some mouth watering, juicy kebabs. I tried the chicken irani kebab and the mutton shikar which was simply delicious. Don‚Äôt forget to try out the evergreen warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce.‚ù§Ô∏è
The ambience and the courteous staff further add up as a positive. 
The only reason why i would think twice before going here would be the long waiting queue owing to their no reservation rule.

Old is gold they say!!!
A saying true to its core when it comes to petercat!!
This oldie of the city of joy in its heart represents the long gone british culture with its iconic dish chelo kebab!!
A must try along wth other sumptous dishes like sizzlers probably one of the best in kolkata.
A place that we can bank on be it a sudden outing or a planned one. This time i went with the irani kebab and shimar (mutton prep) for starters and were good bt not the best considering that iranian is xpctd to be more cheesier.  Couteous staff,quality food with large enough portions at right prices hits it off together.
The dim lighting adds to the ambience making it ideal for a date too...
A must visit in kolkata.
Ps: thats a vanilla brownie icecream with loads of hot chocolate and the chelo kebab!!

Even though it was on Dashami I couldn't quite understand the madness. There were easily over a 50 people queuing up outside to get a table over here. Two hours later when that fully loaded platter of Chelo kebab arrived, it justified all the trouble that we went through to get that table.
Definitely adding it to the itenarary of my annual Kolkata visits.

It was my first experience with peters cat. The dim light ambience was very calm and good.
I have ordered their flagship menu Chelo kebab and their Peter cats special dessert. Hospitality was great despite a 20mins delay between the orders.

Chelo kebab:
It was served with two chicken sheekh and a kebab served on top of the steamed rice with a fried egg and three cubes of butter on top with a grilled tomato.
The texture of the kebab was really good. It would have been a kickass with some mashed potato.

Peterscat special:
The dessert had multiple layres. With an chocolate ice cream (first layer) topping under some fresh fruits and starberry sauce followed by dry fruits and strawberry icream with an vanilla ice cream on the last bottom layer.
It is worth a try.

Overall experience: Very Good despite few extra penny.

Overall thumbs up.

It was a special day for me and my partner when we the place. The ambience was pleasing and the staff gave us a warm welcome. Because we had our car and my partner was driving we didn't opt for liquor. We started with Dry mutton nalli ghost and coke. The dish had a flavor which would remind one of the Mughal period. The fried onions were like a cherry on the cake. Then we had chicken seekh kebab as my partner is a huge fan of kebabs.
And finally, how can one miss chelo kebab when u r in Peter Cat. The food literally woed me. I was overwhelmed to taste it. I ain't a fan of kebabs but I would readily admit that the dish, it's texture and it's presentation impressed me. It was a good experience visiting the place.

It is a great place to visit. The atmosphere is very good and cozy. The staffs were very good and they served the dishes on time. It was my first time in Peter cat and we went there coz of their signature dish chello kabab. We ordered chicken chello kabab and house special sizzler. I would say chello kabab is a bit overrated dish in here. The taste so not so good-firstly the rice which came with it was very less in quantity and had a bit of south tinge. I personally didn't like that. The kebabs were good but the sausages was not up to the mark. Next the sizzler though it was finely cooked but I didn't like it due to its typical churned flavour. Apart from taste the food quality was good. And again I m reminding you all that this was my first encounter and the above review was my personal taste of choice... So guys do visit this place and try to have something other than these dishes. Moreover the price is also reasonable.

Located just at the Park Street 7 way crossing not very difficult to locate, this place has been like a heritage restaurant selling their specialty "Chello kababs"
The place is dimly lit giving a taste of Old Calcutta.
We obviously went for the chello kabab, grilled chicken sizzler, tandoor rooti and a mutton item which I can't find on the menu now apparently.
Chello kabab: Has to be the show stealer as always. Tender pieces of chicken and mutton kababs with poached egg and buttered rice.
Grilled Chicken Sizzler: Was a bit disappointed with this. It only had two chicken pieces in some kind of a tangy sauce with 4 pieces of potatoes and vegetables. I expected something better from the dish compared to the price.
Tandoori roti: Was toooo stiff.
Mutton item: It was a good bit of quantity. Tasted much like home made mutton preparation.
Maybe because of the Pujo rush they were not up to the mark but I expected a bit more from such a restaurant. 
Would surely visit again, after the Pujo.
Anyway people,
Happy fooding ‚úå

We had to wait for almost 2hours to get seats for two, but their management and hospitality was too good

Then chelo kebabs and mutton brain masala

Been there on 30th  of September for lunch. The place was over crowded, and to make it worse the crowd management guy in the gate was hive negative response. After a waiting period of 1hrs 45 mins got a table. We ordered some beer , chicken marakesh , lamb chelo kebab and mutton chelo kebabs, and grilled fish for all of us. The food took around 45 mins to reach the table. We were shocked to find out that the food was cold. The butter rice was cold and the topping of butter was frozen. The lamb seekh was dry as if it was stale or made long before. The grilled fish was only OK.
Pls check the serving temperature and pickup time of the orders you deliver.

Peter cat is synonymous with Chelo kababs. The kababs were certainly good as everyone says but honestly there are many restaurants in Delhi or Lucknow who make such kababs. May be it's the combination of that with Buttered rice is preferred by people. I found Chelo kabab bit of a hype. One must try once for sure. Overall ambience is good..Like any other famous restaurant at park street, here also one has to wait for 20 to 25 min for ones turn on holidays.

I have heard so much about Peter Cat, and so many people swear by this place. We visited this place on a Saturday, and were seated after a brief wait. I decided to order the famous Chelo kebab, which is served on a bed of rice and generous servings of butter as well as some fried eggs. My wife, a vegetarian, ordered a Kulcha with chana masala. The kebab could not honestly live up to the hype. There was nothing wrong with it, but I have had so much better kebabs that this did not simply hit the spot. The kulcha that my wife ordered was really good. However, the chana masala that she ordered was actually more of a chana chat with no hint of gravy. Ideally, the waiter should have warned her since one can't really have Kulcha with a dry sabji, but he did not.

All in all, still good value for money. However, would not want to go back for more.

We decided to order from peter cat as we had not tried it for a long time. We opted for an online order of chicken bharta and keema. Though it was a festive season, delivery was on time. Now, coming to the food. The bharta was bland with excess of cream and lacked taste. Worst bharta I've ever had. The keema was not upto the mark. Really disappointed.

Peter Cat is one of the landmark restaurants in Kolkata, extremely famous for its food. Its signature dish is the Chelo Kebab. As a package the item was very good though no item in particular stood out. None of the items in the package were such that could not have been prepared at home. Quality of cooking was definitely good and the mutton kebab was the best part.

There's nothing more I could say about this place. A legendary place serving authentic food for decades. I was overwhelmed with the ambience, food and gesture of the staff. The place was little Crowded that day, since it was Dasami and everyone was waiting to savour famous Chelo Kebab and Chicken Sizzlers.

Went their during Durga Puja Astami .. We had to wait for nearly 30mins outside to get a table..and the food took 30 more mins to come ! 
We ordered one Chello kebab and one house special sizzler with a dinner roll . There's nothing to complain about the food , loved both the dish.. 
Staffs are well behaved and courteous ..
Would love to visit this place again.

A pretty vintage place in the famous parkstreet. The first suggestion I got was to try the chelo kebab. Buttered rice with mutton and chicken kebabs and nicely decorated. The taste was good and simple. Tried some of their fish curry. It was good too. The service was decent. I liked the different ambiance tried with lamps hanging giving it a different look.

If Peter Cat does not deserve a 5 on 5, I don't know what would!

This place is just legendary to say the least. Food quality over my few visits over the past 7-8 months has been consistently impeccable. The waiting time does seem to bother at times, but it's all worth it once you're seated and waiting for your favourite food to arrive!!

Our favourites here have been Chelo Kebab (which is a dish so amazing, famous and filling that you will find it being served at each table), Fish Makhmali and Fresh cut mangoes dessert. 

You can go here at any time and you will find a queue. Such is the attraction of this place. Old timers and tourists alike seem to love everything about its food at the very first bite. 

If you are in Kolkata, even if for just a day, this is a MUST VISIT!!

You are never wrong with your choice when you opt for this place, inspite of the tiring long queue outside. The ever endearing "Chelo Kabab" , the¬† "Tandoori Mixed Grill" sizzler & the "Prawn Cocktail" keeps you mesmerized and just like always, I keep coming back here for more. Thank you Peter Cat for keeping the fire alive...

.... A perfect end of puja was having a lunch at peter cat!!! Though we have to wait for around 1hour but it was worth waiting... We ordered chelo kabab nd chicken steak sizzlers!! As per I heard peter cat is famous for sizzlers but the chelo kabab was the one which was the star of our lunch!! That buttery rice, that juicy kababs each nd every item was mind boggling nd no doubt the sizzlers were great too.... Hopefully we will be visiting soon nd will be testing more dishes!!!

We have to wait around 1.5 hrs to cross the threshold of peter cat. A legend of Kolkata no doubt. Went there on asthami evening. The ambience is fantastic and the staffs are friendly. We ordered there famous chello kebab which was incredibly tasty. I like the special aroma of the butter rice. Chicken was more tasty than the mutton. The booze is over priced according to me but they provide "chakna" i.e. bhujiyas and nimki. They also have a strict rule of age restrictions for serving liquor so make sure you carry some id proof.

Are you a lover of chello kebabs? Then worry not. This is the best place in town where you can have a fulfilling plate of chello Kebab within a very pocket friendly range. The ambience is cozy and comfortable. It becomes all the more soothing because of the dim lights setting along with a comfortable seating arrangements.

Love everything about it. it's been a huge part of my childhood.their specialties like the chelo kabab and sizzlers are just to die for. As soon as your the sizzle your mouth instantly starts to water no matter to whose table the dish is going to. The chocolate souffle was as light as a cloud and was no too overpoweringly sweet.

Went to have a good time n fun there for the first time at a well establised resturant...but really except the chelo kabab & sizzler ... we ordered chicken biriyani n pulao. The pulao is equivalent to normal steam rice both in looks and in taste too... and the biriyani is equivalent to the normal chicken rice which we can cook even better in home than in this resturant. Overall not satisfactory... frankly speaking... didnt expected this...
But yess chelo kabab and sizzler is really good. Truely.

A start to the Durga puja 2017 with bestie over lunch at Peter cat. I do not remember the last time I was here. May be 1.5 decades ago was the last time I was there for a family lunch. 
Nothing has changed since then. This place remains the cozy place. We tried it legendary chelo kabab, grilled chicken sizzler and fresh lime soda.
Ambiance is very sober. The staff is very polite and helpful. 
Another lunch /dinner is soon due here. 
Food is great. Chelo kabab was bang on. The grilled chicken was awsome. Juicy chicken in butter sauce gravy . 
Coming back soon .

The cheelo kebabs were good. the starters were sad to say the least. We had chicken, fish and paneer and all tasted the same. It felt like the protein was simply dunked in one standard sauce. The biggest let down was the service. The most unpleasant staff I have encountered in a while. Also I asked for two slices of boiled potatoes for my 1 year old baby. The answer was we do not keep an boiled potatoes. I asked for any boiled veggies to keep her engaged. And for this I was told I had to buy a full portion of boiled veggies which by the way included potatoes for that. Charged exorbitant of course.

I have eaten here twice, and quite naturally both times the food was centered around the famous Chelo Kebab. It is delicious. The sizzler and the desserts were also good. The ambience is brilliant with the dim light from the circled lamp. Only con is that you have to wait outside very long to get entry and there is no seating arrangement. 
But overall, Peter Cat is one of the best and cost effective restaurants in the town, certainly deserve a visit.

Peter Cat is not worth it anymore.
Been to Peter Cat a numerous times.. But this visit after about a. Couple of years is simply disappointing.
Took my entire family for dinner but trust me it's not worth at all. We were six heads so we thought of trying out a few different dishes available.
We thought of trying the Indian dished  rather than trying their signature dish Chello Kabab.

Starters-
We ordered Irani Chicken kabab and Chicken Tikka Kabab as starters. The chicken Piece were very very small.. it's like the size of kabab used in chicken roll, and most of the pieces were burnt.
Mutton Seekh Kabab was stiff and very dry.
Fish Makhmali was better that the others.
No Green Chatney with any of the Kababs.

Main Course-
Tandoori Roti were mostly burned.
Garlic Naan was ok.
Malai Kofta was awful.
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala - Extremely small pieces, tastes wise very blant.
Mutton Nawabi- Extremely small pieces. No marination. Stiff, tastes awful.
Grilled Fish Sizzler- taste ok. Piece Moderate. Potatoes tastes really nice.
Mutton Hamburger Steak- ok ok.excess use of Soya Sauce.

I am not going back again as it's just a Brand with below average food.

Peter cat is a well known restaurant in Kolkata. Anyone who has heard of this place knows and will recommend the chelo kabab which isn't anything special but not bad for a try. They serve some great North Indian food and they stand out big time! The only issue with this place is that it remains crowded most of the time and one have to deal with a queue. But the overall experience was great.

Have been visiting this restaurant since 1995 and I must say it's just been getting better with age. 

Loved the chicken marrakesh and the chelo kebab - two signature dishes of this restaurant. The rice was fragrant and sinfully buttered. The chicken was good in both the dishes.

Service was prompt! Ambience has not changed since the last 22 years  - I think most of the servers are also the same üòä.

The Location : Located in Park Street, this place is easily accessible by cab or by metro.
The Ambience : From the moment you enter the restaurant, the wooden interior and the waiters dressed in suit and Pagri, will make you feel like you're walking into a distant bygone era in history. I love this kind of feeling. So, this is a big thumbs up for me.
The service was polite and prompt.
The Food :
Cream of chicken and Dinner Roll : Spot on. Very balanced taste.
I ordered the very hyped Chello Kebabs. And I kid you not, they deserve all the hype they get. The taste was incredible.
My absolute special was the House Special Sizzler with Chicken Sausages.  It was very tasty.  And worth the money.  
Pocket Pinch: Slightly over priced. But its worth the food.
Recommendations : A definite yes. Apt for a nice romantic date or for a family time out with loved ones.

One of the best places to eat if you are in kolkata..  Starting from chicken salad to kebabs and prawns.. All are mouth watering and is irresistible.. Its a most go and highly recommended.. The ambience,  lighting,  music and decor of the place is very pleasant..  The food is worth its cost,  the delicacies at the end is something to die for...

Went there on Monday with my office colleagues.. We book a table of eight people.ambience was nice.. But serving is a little bit on a slower side.. We ordered chelo kebab,chicken sizzler..Chicken sizzler was good.. Nd the chelo kabab basically a platter which consist one chicken kabab stick with onion, tomato, two mutton kabab, rice with butter, one egg omelet.. It was quite good and new to me.. But not awesome.. Then we have ordered brownie with ice-cream and hot chocolate syrup... It was yummy but overpriced.. Overall a good experience..

An old restaurant at park street, awesome ambience. Foods are delicious. Courtesious staffs. Have to wait for a long time if you visit in peak hours. Ordered Tandoori chicken full plate and an authentic dish named chelo kebab and a cocktail Mojito. Tandoori chicken was well prepared and soft n juicy. There were 4 large pcs in a plate. The chelo kebab can be a complete meal. The platter contains a portion of butter rice topped with an egg poach, two mutton kebab sticks, one stick of chicken, paneer and chicken liver alongwith slices of cappcicum onioin and tomato. The total bill was 1531 including GST for 2 plates of chelo kebab, 1 mojito, 1 full tandoori chicken which was quite reasonable as they are still maintaining food quality and quantity as well. Everyone will suggest chelo kebab but im gonna suggest Tandoori chicken. A variety of sizzlers and cocktails are also available. Gonna visit soon to taste the other dishes one after one.

Its a gem in Kolkata, each tandoor item has a peculiar  taste and aroma. Preferred mutton chhelo kebabs over chicken. I must visit for every Kolkata visitor.

Had to keep 0.5 for the plates and serving bowls which look old and not fresh.

One of the most popular restaurants of kolkata. The ambience is mind boggling. Gives u a feeling ur in an era of British Indian restaurants. U can get a huge variety of cocktails and mocktails. Mainly famous for continental food. Seafood is also something they specialise on. Sizzlers are one of the main attractions. But the most sort after dish is the chello kebab.

Having heard so much about this restaurant and Chelo kabab, sizzlers we planned to dine out at this place but this only brought disappointment to us.The food was not worthy of the hype it has created in Kolkata. The price was too high and tasteless food.This is one of the most over rated restaurants in Kolkata. There is nothing special about the kababs and sizzlers. Also, the serving staffs were not good and there was long delay in food arrival after placing order.You would find no one , none of the waiter at the service when you would need anything.I think the high rate of food is charged just for the ambiance and that you got to seat at one of the most hyped restaurants. If you are a food lover then this place is not surely the one you would love.I will not recommend this to anyone ever!!! This will only burn a huge hole in your pocket while your taste buds would be dissatisfied!!

Been to this restaurant couple of times. Wait! You just can't go and take a seat. This place is crowded with foodies almost every time round the year. I had to stay in the que too. Coming to the food -- One must order a Chelo Kebab and a house special sizzler once there! Chelo kebabs from this restaurant are utterly delicious. House special sizzler is the add on to your taste buds. Only thing this place lacks is their cocktail collection. With every day a new restaurant popping out in the city and having had innovative menus of cocktails, this restaurant needs to reconsider its cocktails. Ambience is great that gives a subtle feeling. Spacious and well decorated.

Peter cat Situated in Park Street is all about Chelo Kebab. Personally I didn't enjoy it. But still it is a lip smacking dish and one must try it once. Sizzlers are also awesome. The Mango soufle shall also be tried once. The ambience is also good. Service is fine.

Just putting a placeholder here for the great review to follow.

Was pleasantly surprised with the 'chello kabab', which was just awesome. Different flavours in one dish - the kebabs , egg , butter and the spice rice : just so yummy.

Peter Cat cooler also does a great job hitting you strong at just one.

This historically famous restaurant located at tge celebrated Park Street is surely living upto it's name. Like most other visitor I always make it a point to order the iconic chelo kebab . It's always wonderful. Besides i have tried their Chicken marakesh which simply has a bell pepper instead of the poached egg. Nevertheless both are  a treat to my tastebuds. For newbies Peter Cat is definitely worth a visit.And for those whi have already visited it they need not be told that it is totally worth it to relive the experience. It's pretty crowded because it's very famous. The indoor lighting attempts to make it soothing. However you can not spend one moment without the clinking  of the cutlery. But then again it's totally worth it.

Their Chelo Kebab is best in the world and when it comes to service, they stand out big time!!
Close your eyes, put your finger on the menu and choose whatever dish comes up, you are bound to hit a gem!
The only issue with this place is that it remains crowded most of the time and you have to deal with a long queue! It's a must. But the experience is definitely worth the wait! *_*

This place has always been on my wishlist in order to try their famous chello kebab. Though i have visited this place once with my parents when i was a child. Since then i was waiting to visit here for the second time. This restaurant always remains crowded, though we got a place to sit within 10 mins of waiting. The ambience is really cozy. We ordered a plate of chello kebab and one chicken steak sizzler. The chello kebab consists of buttered rice with a sunny side up on top of it alongwith two mutton seekh kebabs and some 8 pieces of chicken reshmi kebab. It tasted like heaven. Then came the sizzler with lots of potatoes and other veggies. It also had 2 boneless breast pieces of chicken layered with mushroom sauce. This tasted good but so many potatoes wasnt liked much. Anyways would definitely come back to gorge on their chello kebab. üòõ

So I had went to this place with good expectations reading all the reviews.

But as it turned out the waiter was 'aggressive' when I just asked for changing my seat. They didn't have any courtesy at all. This killed our mood for the day.
I even saw waiters arguing amongst themselves.

We ordered a mocktail which was okay, but the food didn't impress us. 
So called speciality of the restaurant Chello Kebab, was bland and dry.

And they take so much time for everything!
I asked for the bill, and it's like 10 minutes still nothing.

Only thing I liked about this place, was the ambience.

All in all, never going back to this restaurant ever in eternity.

This is one of the iconic restaurants in Calcutta. As recommended we have tried Chelo kebab and House sizzlers. Both the dishes were tasty and a fine restaurant quality dishes. Service was also impressive with minimal waiting time once you order the food however, yes to get inside the restaurant the waiting was forever :-).
We also had mutton curry and roti, which was good too. Overall it's a restaurant you can certainly visit again if your pocket permits since the pricing is little on the higher side.

There's nothing much to review about a restaurant that I have been visiting since a young child; a place that has really been iconic to our city. 
I recently visited Peter Cat after a gap of a few years along with my brothers. Immediately after entering the restaurant was a moment of nostalgia as the smell of the sizzlers and certain spices used to make   our appetite go few notches higher than usual. I've always appreciated the overall ambiance of Peter Cat, because visually the dim lit atmosphere used to be very appealing.
We had ordered for Chelo Kebabs, and some naans along with black dal and a vegetable dish. As always, the food was outstanding. The Chelo Kebab should now be considered as the greatest dish of Kolkata due to it's taste being consistent throughout all these years. The rice along with the fried egg and butter was something I really missed. It was succulent and just melted in my mouth, made me feel relaxed. Overall it was a great experience, and I hope to come back soon as possible.

In Kolkata, it would be highly impossible to call yourself a foodie if you haven't visited the legendary restaurants one of which is this. They've been here for ages and you still have to stand in a queue even on  random evening waiting to get a table.
The service is a very traditional classic one with "not so serious about you" staff and a classic and popular menu. Though the quality of the food has degraded compared to what they used to be but still worth the reputation.

Anyone who's heard of this place knows and will recommend the "Chello Kebab" which isn't anything special but not bad for a try. The sizzlers are beautifully made as well though almost all of them taste the same with minor changes. We mistakenly ordered this Tandoori kebab which by chance tasted amazing. I would surely recommend it. Other than these, there's loads of continental options in fishes and chicken; they're all worth a try depending on your taste.

Try out the authentic and famous Chelo Kabab of Peter Cat. That's what most people try. However, you'll get a range of contiental and north indian cuisine. Located at the most flamboyant area of Kolkata, the restaurant is above average budget. The ambience is great.

Very famous and renowned Food Joints like Peter Cat doesn't need reviews to attract foodies!!!
          Located exactly opposite to The Park Hotel in Park Street, this restaurant offers the best Chelo kebabs and sizzlers in Kolkata. 
We visited this place on the occasion of Christmas last year. Though I am bit late in writing the review but it's like "better late than never ".

In the food we ordered their Signature dishes:-
1. Chicken Steak Sizzler- Chicken Steak served with little baby potatoes and yummy creamy brown tangy sauce poured into it.Taste was average, not that wow factor.
2. Grilled Fish Sizzler- Grilled fish served with some boiled vegetables and a poached egg. This dish was quite good and well prepared 
3. Chicken Chelo kabab- The best dish of the day, Peter Cat's Signature Dish. It was served with aromatic butter rice with chicken, mutton kebabs and perfectly done poached egg on top. A complete meal in itself and awesome in taste. Every bite of it melted into our mouth like pure bliss.
4.Chocolate Brownie:- Last but not the least we ordered this dish for dessert. It was also good in taste.
A must try place for all kebab and steak lovers...
Note:- Be prepared to stand in a queue for an hour or so for getting the table if visiting on any weekends.

This is a highly overrated place.I honestly did not find anything special about the food.Yes it is one of the oldest heritage place providing a very well known dish and for that a one time experience for me was enough.There is nothing which will attract me to go to this place again.Moreover the floor manager dealt with us with a very rude attitude because we shifted seats(after asking a waiter who nodded in affermative) to a place with better lighting.He eaid that we could not change seats without 'permission'.Coming to the food,we ordered two special sizzlers and two chello kebab.The sizzler sauce was basically drowned in Soya Sauce and it was not at all a pleasant experience having it.The chello kebab was far better,the chicken kebabs were the winner for me.Rice,butter,kebab and poaced eggs, there is nothing that can taste bad.The service was very quick as these too are the most popular dishes there.

The overall experience for us was below average considering both the food and the attitude of the managers of this place.

Reputed for its Chellow Kabab and clad with an aura of 'sophistication', this place is one of the heavy-hitters near Park Street, and that's saying something. From the uniformed usher to the turbanned staff inside, this place imitates nawabi charm and tries to live upto the expectations built by the tales of previous visitors.

After waiting outside for quite some time, we were finally accommodated. Strolling past the outer dining area, we entered the inner chamber, so to speak, with more of a private feel to it. We ordered the fabled Chellow Kababs, served with rice, vegetables, butter and an egg. The dish, indeed, was cooked decently and tries to live upto the tales but the price felt way steeper for the quantity...chalk it upto the price of ambience. The kebabs were a bit dry and the rice was a bit bland with a dollop of plain butter moonlighting over it but not making a difference in anyway. It wasn't the Chellow Kabab that was the star of the day...it was the Mocha Souffl√©(souffle of the day). Costly? Yes! Worth it? Hell yes! The lightness of the souffl√© was nailed aptly and the sweetness was appropriate, although the satisfaction in watching a souffl√© rise up the ramekin as a testament to its quality and technical flawlessness isn't present here since it isn't served in its original container!

The staff was either utterly professional or can be said to be verging on passive aggressive in nature. Their preference for customers with deeper pockets, judged on the basis of attire and conversational medium, is the definition of elitism and classism lurking in the society. All in all, one must keep their expectations in check and the experience will be accordingly 'rewarding'... Not disastrous, not heavenly.

Well the ambience of this place is vintage and classy. You have waitors dressed in suits to welcome you and you have waitors dressed in traditional indian wear to serve you. Its the best of both worlds.

Being a vegetarian and bored of Paneer dishes, we wanted to try something different. We ordered Rajma Galauti Kabab and boy, wasn't it good. It was one of the best that i have ever had and for the reataurant to deliver such a taste considering the fact that very few people would go for it, is bound to earn your respect. 

You can only complain of the quantity as they serve only 4 pieces at Rs. 195. But then, very few people would care about the money if they are visitng this place. If you are in Kolkata, this is the place to enjoy your meals regularly.

I have been to this restaurant many times and every time i ordered for Chelo Kebab platter and was overwhelmed each n every time. But this time i tried many other things along with this also.
I ordered for Cream of Sweet corn chicken soup, Prawn cocktail ( cold soup), chicke  Reshmi kebab, Chicken steak in sizzlers, and obviously Chelo Kebab.
Now coming to review part:
--Ambience, Behaviour, Waiting time : Ambience is just like old 80s posh restaurant. Behaviour of attendants are anyday very good. If you are going for lunch or dinner, either reach early before the pick lunch or dinner time, if not then take ur time n keep patience while standing in queue waiting  for ur turn. This part is very annoying. 
-- Food quality, quantity and taste:
1. Soup was nice n taste was off bit than served in other restaurants. Very good in taste and yummy.
2. Reshmi kebab was good and prawn cocktail was outstanding in taste and quality.
3. Chelo kebab I don't have to say anything.
4. Chicken steak sizzler just yummy.

If u live in kol or came from outside n not visited this place, please visit and taste their cuisines. 

And i will go many times.

Chelo kabab and Sizzlers are the things why I choose this place. And mutton dishes too. You can't ever be bored of this place. Although you will always have to keep asking about your orders from the waiters..have patience as they take a lot of time, but at the end it's worth waiting.

One of the best dishes I have had especially under the Veg food options in India.
Unique yet tasty: A must have whenever you go to Kolkata.

Chello Kabab Veg: 9.5/10
Chello Kabab Non Veg: 9/10

While the unique combination of rice and Kabab excite you enough the taste never lets you down. A complete value for money and you fill your appetite with the different flavors among the spectrum of options on your plate.

Super Thumbs Up

I've been there 3-4 times I don't know the food and ambience didn't make me satisfied... Rather I prefer Mocambo than Peter Cat...¬† I don't understand why people wait for hours to enter in this restaurant.. Anyway last year we went for lunch and we had to wait for 30mins,I found it very noise not that well maintained.. Any way we ordered there Signature Dish1.Chicken Chelo Kebab (4/5) 
2. Mutton Chelo Kebab (3.5) 
3. Mutton Sizzler (3/5 ) :¬† Too much of gravy with flavour of Indian spices, which I really don't like ...¬† Dominant smell of Indian Spices in Continental Dishes spoils the preparation...

True to its word Peter cat is the place for food lovers delight in Calcutta. Tasty food and friendly staff and excited customers makes the place an attraction if you are a foodie. I loved the chello kabab and the sizzlers. Also enjoyed their Prawn starters. There could be a waiting line so if you are in a rush pls plan ahead of time. Parking is tight. Overall ambience and the food and the pricing a definitely must visit place.

It was Birthday Of my friend , so we dropped in this outlet , ordered chicken chelo kebab platter , mutton chelo kebab platter , Liver Fry and Fish Sizzler..

1stly they didnt allow us to cut the cake ! Now who does that ? Most of the restaurants that i have visited allows cake cutting infact few restaurants even provides complimentary cake !  Well if not complimentary atleast make the bday person feel little special !

Well now speaking about food -
1. Liver Fry - was okayish , little more on tangy side ! 
2. Mutton chelo kebab platter - the taste of the rice was amazing , mutton kebabs were good too ...
3. Chicken chelo kebab platter - over all good in taste , though the chicken could have been a bit juicy which it wasn't , but they give mutton seek kebab too with the chicken platter ! I mean whyyyyy ???? Some one who is ordering chicken it's obvious he/she wants chicken and not mutton ! Then why mutton and chicken together in chicken platter ?
4. Fish sizzler - it was good ... no complaints..

And i also want to mention that this restaurant charges 62‚Çπ for a bottle of 200ml coke which has print of 18‚Çπ mrp ! Now thats cheating and illegal.. if you are charging 62‚Çπ and mentioning that its for the service you provide and ac and all then please Serve the coke in proper Glass with a straw or little garnish atleast ! So that it looks like a 62‚Çπ coke ! N not just keep the bottle of coke on the table with a very ordinary water tumbler ..

Environment is good price is okay, but the problem is the taste of the food is worst. I had chelo kabab, which is not bad, but the special kabab and chicken bharta was worst. Also the Browne,vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce is not at all looks good and small also, which is very good at other restaurant, taste of the hot chocolate sauce was just worst.

One of the most popular food joints of the city, located primely in parkstreet, beside flurys. Talking about this place, the ambience is really great, specially the dressing of the waiters, their food serving style, the soft music, pretty much afghani touch in everything, even d lighting. The food served here tastes really great, specially if your taste buds crave for kababs and sizzlers. The sizzlers, kababs are roasted to perfection and ofcourse the very special Chelo Kabab. The dish served include butter rice, sheekh kabab,chicken kabab,salad and egg poach. All served in a single dish,properly decorated and good enough to fill your stomach and satiate your taste buds. Looking forward to visit this place again to taste new dishes.

A legendary restaurant that has withstood the onslaught of the new age entries. This place has retained its old ways....seen in the dim lighting, the menu and good presentation and even in the uniforms of the servers. All old school and so nostalgic for most of us. Having said that , it is irritating to always have to wait outside, especially in the heat. But it probably is good news for the management!! They have their loyal clientele. My friend had the chicken roast sizzler which she liked. I wanted to try their famous chelo kebab,but being a vegetarian thought that wouldn't be possible. But, lo and behold, it was possible as they had a veg version of it also. Though according to my friend it was a sacrilege to have a veg chelo kebab??üòÇ
I was happy with my experience, liked the dish, served with buttered rice were three types of veg kebab, hara Bharat seekh kebab, paneer tikka kebab and a potato one together with a few pieces of salad
 I felt they could have been a little more generous by giving more pieces of the fresh veggies. Overall good.

The name and the fame both are appropriate with this restraurent ...
Perfect amalgamation of continental food and the beautiful ambience are pure bliss...

Ambience (4/5)-Perfect for the romantic couple as well for friends and for family... always crowded.. light was not so bright.. gives you perfect peace and privacy.....

Location- chelo kabab itself the guide towards peter cat...jokes a part...located at the crossing of middleton row and park street ...
I had to wait for long because of the queue..

Staffs-(4/5) were very much friendly...prompt..

Food-1.Appealing Chelo kabab (5/5)- I had both mutton chelo and chiken chelo...both were delicious...a complete meal,too quick to complete as because every thng just melted in my mouth like butter..
2. sizzler roast chicken-chicken was tender ,Smokey taste,perfect baked veggies just awsome..
3.Dinning roll-not much good
4.Tandoori roti -okish 
5.Chiken butter masala- delicious.

Service-Prompt nd experienced ..
Highly recommended for chelo kabab and sizzler..
Wish to come till my craving for chelo remains alive...

Everything about this place is superb.  Great food great ambience great crowd the only thing not that good about this place are the people handling it.  They are at times rude and unfriendly. 

Thumbs up -  1. the dish preparation -  no matter what time u go I'll be served with exactly the same qty and same taste everytime. 2.The ambience - You will have a feeling of a classic old restaurant with all the facilities of a modern one its like going back in time.  It's a big thumbs up.  Must haves would be cello kebab undoubtedly then prawn cocktail and sizzler. 

Thumbs down -  the place is crowded all the time so will have to wait for sometime to get ur own table. 

Cost for 2 - ‚Çπ 1200 -  1500

It's a shame that I could never visit this place in my 24 years of spending time in Calcutta (read born n brought up). Only during my nth visit to the city of joy, I had the joy of visiting this place.¬†
I have been hearing about Chelo Kebab since my childhood and no one makes them like PeterCat and alas I had missed this all along. My vegetarian friends also rebuked me for not trying (and how!).
But after a long wait of 1.3 hours in the queue my friend and I managed to get a table after much ruckus. Ordered the famous dish and of course beer, I was greeted by a plate full of meat and delicious and aromatic butter rice. Instantly I started drooling. One bite of the tender juicy meat the the spoon of the butter rice makes you forget all hatred in the world and catapults you the inner realms of heaven where angels made their abode and where there is peace and serenity.¬†
I can go on with the adjectives, but dont want to make it a tiring read :)
Over all the waiting was worth it. Needless to say a must visit place.

Had a long-time desire to vist one of the most well-praised restaurants of Kolkata- Peter Cat and trust  me, it lives up to its reputation :) right from the moment we entered , from the rushing of well-dressed men to escort us to our seats and their courteous behavior, to their expertise in the serving style ..... I could have given 10 on 5, if I could! We had chello kebabs and chicken house sizzler.  Chello kebabs, ah!!!! Basmati ric with butter cubes , with mutton and chicken kebabs and grilled vegetables, oh I can feel my mouth watering as I write about it! And the sizzle too was prepared in a very tasty sauce, with the chicken wings coated with battered eggs, and served with sausages and veggies. Even on our way out, the royal way on knocking on the door from inside and a well dressed man bowing to us as he pulled the door open  will give a royal feel!

So my first visit to the legendary "Peter Cat" was pretty good. I won't say the place was unusually crammed with people, given it was a Sunday. Of course, Chelo Kebab was ordered. Peter Cat and Chelo Kebab are synonymous now! It tasted pretty good. I mean I've had Chelo Kebabs in many other places but what stood out here was the exceptionally good quality of rice used. The Kebabs were soft but okayish to be honest.
Service was satisfactory and the ambiance was note worthy.

My first visit here. Naturally went for their house specialty, the Chello Kebab. The buttery rice was smooth and the kebabs were total finesse. They also have a decent assortment of cocktails and drinks to offer. Makes way for perfect lunch/dinner dates.

Place is always jam-packed presumably, so it's best to choose your timing in advance to prevent standing in queue for long.

Finally Peter Cat is back to its good old glory...
- The Chelo Kebabs is back to its original flavours, freshness & quantity
- The service is great & not overbearing; seems like new energetic staff
- Plus enjoyed the neighbouring good old Bengali gossip ranging from the ilish mach (hilsa fish) price to rental prices in Bangalore to why one should not marry to the disgusting attitude in Accenture to the useless GST, etc, etc...üòé

Had a great time & a definite visit if in Kolkata!üëç

We ordered fresh lime soda, mutton nalli gosht(on server's suggestion) and the famous chello kebab (chicken).

The chello kebab was good and tasty. To our surprise the mutton nalli gosht which was suggested by them was poor in taste and that too it costed more than the famous traditional chello kebab. The ambience was good. The servers were courteous.

Would suggest not to go by the server's suggestion.

We ordered Chelo Kababs and Toast. The food was awesome with respect to both quality as well as quantity. The light atmosphere made the presence more comfortable. The managers are very friendly and respectful.

Visiting such a renowned and classy restaurant needs mental preparation. Been there on the eve of our anniversary. The ambience was quite good  with dim lighting adding to the vintage mood of the restaurant. We ordered their signature Chelo kebab  and Chicken steak sizzler. Both the dishes were  a delight to the taste buds.. but still i would like to mention that the chelo kebab is a bit over-hyped. I have been warned previously about the rudeness of the waiters there..but personally i didnt have any bitter experience.
Would like to go back again.

It is sometimes scary to walk into an iconic place knowing that the servers are going to be rude no matter what and that kind of shatters the entire experience. However, we were happy enough to see that they were too busy doing their job and therefore we could eat in peace.¬†

The chello kebab here is surely class apart. its difficult to like the ones served anywhere else in the country after you try it here. i love their buttery rice too. my friend ordered a chicken steak sizzler and that was pretty great too with baby potatoes and creamy brown sauce. we ended our meal with a souffle and although it wasn't quite the souffle of your dream but it did fare well on our cards. the texture was kind of velvety and the whole thing was airy and light.¬†
I will surely be back there soon :)

If i was to rate this place only on its food i would have given it a 5 but service plays an important role in making up a good restaurant and that is something which this place seriously lacks. Most of the service staff is rude and they behave like they are doing you a favour by serving you.

Ambiance - Classic decor with beautiful night lamps hanging above your table. You may call the place kind of romantic basis the decor but since its alwayssss crowded, you cannot get much of personal time. Its more about the food.

Food - Must try list has thr all time favourite Chelo Kebab. If you are a mutton lover then the Mutton Raan is to die for. Best Raan prepration in Kolkata i have seen. Prawn cocktail is another recommend. Sizzlers i wouldn't say are great but decently ok. Do ask them on the portion of dish bcoz most of the items only suffice one person. For Desserts you can try the caramel custard.

Price - It's a tad on the expensive side but the food quality is worth the money.

Overall if you are someone whoz travelling to Kolkata then the place is a must try. If you are a local then try going on weekdays as weekends have longggg waiting queues.

Being a peter cat regular since childhood I was seriously disappointed yesterday while having luch there. Never faced such a poor and slow service! Nothing (seriously nothing) went right truly. Table in charge and waiter were not right... and the waiter waiting & mentioning tip not included in the bill just added more to the horrible experience. Seriously Peter Cat dont disappoint me again as you were always one of my favourites.

Not worth the hype. The mutton seekh in the famous chello kabab is not fully meat, the Barbq next door serves better chello kabab. The chicken steak was accompanied with cold boiled veggies and bad tasting potato.

Peter cat is a very renowned place located in Park Street and it has been there for decades. It is one the Biggest Heritage Kolkata restaurants. ‚ù§üôÇ
A friend of mine took us there for her birthday lunch and it was my first time there. I basically loved the experience once we got to enter the restaurant. But we had to wait for 45 mins before we could enter. There was a long waiting line that day I don't know why. But once we went in, it was all worth the wait.

LOCATION- Peter cat isn't very hard to locate. It's just a few minutes of walking distance from the park street metro station and its located just to the opposite of KFC.

AMBIANCE AND DECOR- This place is a hit. It is a sophisticated and a dimly lit place which has got that warm feeling to it. Once you seat in one of their couch you kinda just sunk in it. üòç ( Not kidding)
Seriously the ambiance is way too good. 

STAFF- The staff was polite and humble enough. They waited patiently as kept on changing our orders. Sorry about that.

FOOD- Now coming to the food. The speciality of them "THE ORIGINAL CHELLO KEBABS". Chello Kebab is an Iranian dish in which freshly made kebabs are served on a bed of basmati rice. They had two choices of CHELLO KEBAB. One consists of Juicy and tender chicken kebabs and two mutton seekh kebabs with basmati rice along with dollops of butter and salad and the other dish contains of all the kebabs but made of mutton. So we decided to try the original CHELLO KEBAB. And along with that we also ordered CHICKEN SIZZLER and BIRIYANI NAINTARA.
BIRIYANI NAINTARA is a vegetarian biriyani. 
Now coming to the quality of the CHELLO KEBAB it was awesome. The Chicken kebabs were juicy,tender,moist and with all spices in the right places. The mutton seekh Kebab was also very juicy and tender. The rice was steamed rice and as I am a  Bengali nothing can go wrong with hot basmati rice and dollops of amul butter with little sprinkles of salt over it. So for me is was oh-so-delicious ‚ù§‚ù§.
The chicken sizzler also tasted very good. But I guess the sugar in the preparation was a bit high. Other than that it was fantastic.
I am so mesmerized with this place I am surely gonna visit this place again anytime soon. ‚ù§

Usually this place is crowded during weekends. Licky for us we went on a weekday. We obviously ordered the chelo kebab. The food was pretty good. Well cooked and seasoned. The waiting time was quite reasonable. 
The only let down is the ambience. It isn't the worst but a better furnished and decorated place would surely lift up the mood some more.

Here is a Resturant which features on every food lovers list if you are in kolkata. The chola kebab dish is just awesome. Nuns and chicken dishes are also tasty. The old kolkata charm is still there. You can feel the 70's 80' s in the ambience. But service is not that great. Decorum is okish. Didnot taste the cocktails or didnot booze so can't comment. But if love food, you will enjoy. If you look at at comparing the overall experience sadly it is lacking behind . Problem is peter cat is an establishment. But lets undertsand chola kebab is what you come over here for. So if care for your taste buds dont miss this place.

I heard so much about this place that I decided whenever I am in Kolkata next I'll be visiting it for sure. 

After visiting it I have mixed feelings, the food is awesome, out of the world and whatever you say will be less but the ambience is bit dingy and staff is impolite (not the serving staff).

Food: 10/10
Being a vegetation when I go to a place famous for non veg, I feel a bit apprehensive. But after eating here I am completely a fan of their food.

Veg chelo kebab - Amazing platter having paneer tikka, seekh kebab, tandoori aloo and rice. Each and every item in the platter is delicious. A platter is good enough for 1 person.

Veg Marrakech kebab - We ordered it on the recommendation of our server and we were delighted. Contents of this platter is same as chelo kebab platter, just preparation is different. Equally good.

Dal Makhani - Very good

Butter Nan - Different and very nice, loved it.

Ambience: 6/10
The red lampshades on every table and red sofa covers reminded me of Chinatown. Can't understand why the owners have decided to go with this color theme. 
Lighting is minimal and overall is quite dull.
Entire flooring is covered with carpet which looks worn out and should be replaced.

Service:
Serving staff is very well trained and helpful. 
Food takes a lot of time to come, 20-25 minutes waiting time is minimum after you place the order, which is understandable considering the number of people and preparing kebabs take little time.
Major setback is the person who writes name of the people standing in the que outside, waiting for their turn to get in. His name is Mr. Manish and he was quite rude and impolite with everyone. He needs to take some classes on hospitality.

Ignoring everything visit this place for amazing kebabs and food will not disappoint you.

PS: For lunch come before 1 or post 2:30 to avoid waiting and for dinner come before 8.

Today i visited petercat with my girlfriend... I would like to thank petercat for this lovely meal... But i was a bit disappointed because they asked for an id proof for ordering the beverages.. Well i would like to say one thing.. If u guys r putting up some rules of anykind... Then it must be equal for everyone, few days back, my friend and his girlfriend visited petercat and there was no id check for ordering beverages... This is sad man.. I wouldn't have expected this from peter cat... A big thumbs down for this... Anyways coming back to the food quality.... Its amazing ... And all the deserts were nice... I ordered the most well known dish of Peter cat that is the authentic chelo kabab and we took souffle of the day and choco nut sundae... The food quality and quantity is above the satisfactory level... I wish they would have approved us for having the beverages... :) if u guys face this same problem then u must put a comment below so that next time we can work that out.... :) i am giving a rating of 4 that is only for their food quality and quantity!!!!!

One of my most favorite restaurants. The food they serve is simply scrumptious. My all time favorite is their Chelo Kebab and brownie ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. The ambiece is nice although there's room for improvement. The presentation can be a little better. But really, I have nothing bad to say about this place other than the fact that it's crowded most of the time and getting a seat can be a hassle at peak times. I would really like to try their sizzlers next time. The prices are pretty high but the food is just divine. Love this establishment.

One of the most intriguing places of the City of Joy. Peter Cat has always been a place I visit w/ family whenever I'm at hometown.

I would like to share my most recent experience in the form of ratings:
Food that we ordered:
Prawn Cocktail - 5/5 (never disappointed me)
Chicken Reshmi Kaba - 4/5 (love the way they wrap it within an egg layer)
Chelo Kabab - 3/5 (it's not the same as before, the one they are actually famous for)
Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler - 5/5 (worth the mention)
Ambiance - 3/5
Service - 3/5

Peter Cat is a classic. It's Kolkata's sweetheart amongst restaurants; however over the time it's losing the craze. The staff needs to be more and more spontaneous and efficient. I'm sorry to say this but you just cannot afford to dip down on the taste of the Chelo Kabab, come on guys, you're famous for that!¬†

Regards,
Sayak

Iconic eatery at Park Street- Peter cat. Went there for lunch, had a mixed experience. Place has a vintage feel to it. Prawn cocktail wasn't very nice, boiled prawns were dipped in mayonnaise sauce. But Chicken Chelo kebab was truly signature, except Chicken seekh kebab was dry. But the place was packed on Weekday for lunch.

Peter Cat is perhaps one of the few restaurants in Park Street that has retained its old world charm without compromising quality. The ambience is one its kind. The hanging lambs and the reddish hue is mesmerizing. The service is alright. We ordered their signature Chelo Kebab and Grilled Fish. I was impressed with both. Will like to visit again.

If you are in Kolkata, and want to have a taste of the city, you must visit Peter Cat. Well, for a start, their menu card is shaped like a cat's head and it can remind you of the Chessire Cat from Alice in Wonderland!
When it comes to Peter Cat, everything's a big wow, be it the food, location or ambiance. Located in the heart of Park Street, this is comfortable dining at it's best. You will keep licking your fingers and smacking your lips when the soft Kababs will melt in your mouth, when the splendid sizzlers will flirt with your taste buds, and when the wonderful drinks will take your soul to the seventh heaven.¬†
The menu card has a lot of wit and humor in it, look out for catchy headlines, such as Aphrodisiacs from the Harem!
I am mentioning my top five favorite Peter Cat goodies here:

Chello Kabab - The best, the Baap of all Kababs. Peter Cat's Chello Kabab is a must have food before you die. The splendid varities of Kababs, the softness of rice and butter, the egg poach, yumm!!!

Chicken Stake Sizzler - This babe will just announce herself to your table. Your teeth will slowly delve into the soft chicken pieces, and if you close your eyes you might see an oasis.

Mutton Rang - Almost a whole goat! If you are with a big group, this dish is an essential. It's one of the best mutton preparations.

Prawn Cocktail - Just enjoy the rich taste. You gotta be flamboyant to like it. Lolz!

Fresh Lime Soda Sweet - Traditional as it might sound, watch out for this surprise. When they make it in Peter Cat, they ensure it's the best. The nimboo, the sweetness, the taste, unparallel!

The ambiance is great. Perfect proportion of light and darkness. It's a centrally air conditioned restaurant. Hard drinks are also available. A separate family section is functional in the first floor. Waiters are very well mannered and patient. The only negative part is the huge crowd gathering here, normally in weekends. So if you don't have a prior booking, sometimes you might have to wait for 10-20 minutes.

My first visit to this legendary restaurant in the crossing of Middleton row and park street was as a child with parents. Have visited this place umpteen number of times at different stages of life. Like all Calcuttan, I too have adulation for this place. Their Chelo Kebab or Marakesh Kebab originating from Iran is as famous as the city itself. I love the upstairs. The uniqueness is the metal mug in which they serve beer. Those tables and sofas know so many tales of Kolkata. If you don't mind to queue up, well this is the restaurant to set you feet in. Enjoy the ambience and the naughty cat staring straight into your eyes from the table mat till the plate covers it all.

Had to wait for 3 pieces of chicken and two naan for more than half n hour. The waiter didn't even serve the food. And was asking for tip despite of us paying the bill along with gst- goods and services tax. On refusing the attitude that we were shown left us stunned. He did not return the bill and after asking for the bill we were first told that they lost it. Then returned us a crumbled piece of papaer-the bill. And to mention abt the food. The naan was overcooked i.e burnt.

LOCATION: It is one of the oldest & most prestigious restaurants in Kolkata. Situated in Park Street just beside fluries & au bon pain; it is known to almost every human living in Kolkata.
AMBIENCE: The ambience is classic Park Street, with low red lightings & red coloured walls. It is reminiscent of Kolkata during the British age. Only the temperature of the ac was too cold for me.
SERVICE: Service is very efficient & the behaviour of the staff was really pleasant. But the time taken to deliver the food was a little slow. Also they messed up my dessert order claiming it was unavailable but then again served me the same unavailable dish.
MENU: The menu covers mostly Indianised continental dishes along with the regular North Indian fare. There are a lot of their specialities including sizzlers & the most famous chelo kebabs.
FOOD: The chelo kebab was perfect with the scented aroma of the rice, the accurately‚Äã done egg poach. The kebabs were just melt in the mouth. Lastly the mango souffle stole all the limelight. It was fluffy , creamy & nobody can ever have enough of it. It was just a bite of heaven

A meal in Calcutta at Park street is incomplete without visiting to the popular restaurant Peter Cat,which alongwith Mocambo(having the same owner) remains the most popular dining option in this part of Kolkata.
Peter Cat is arguably the most popular place in town for Sizzlers, and also serves Indian cuisine alongwith continental food.
The popular place has waiting on weekends and we had to wait for sometime to get the table.
We ordered a vegetarian mixed grill sizzler. It was neatly done with thick gravy topping on the vegetable patty. The taste was excellent and the quantity really filling for a person. Apart from it we ordered there a Non vegetarian Chelo Kabab Platter ,which is the signature dish there. The chelo kabab is a fusion of Irani dish in Kolkata style.There was a butter rice bed in centre with sticks of mutton seekh and chicken tikka with vegetables. The mutton seekh was good but the chicken tikka stick was awesome. The dish is very different from any combo I had and enjoyed it.
The place is quite cosy and even though very popular,is reasonably priced as compared to too restaurants in Gurgaon,New Delhi,Mumbai and Bangalore.
Another Calcutta flavour which will remain intact for a long time!!!

They make awesome Chello Kebab. The Kebab is buttery, the best that you can ever view in Kolkata. The rice with the Chello Kebab is a bit is bit bland and buttery as well.

It's extremely cheap for its food quality.Make sure you visit in a non-peak hour like the afternoon. It's very difficult to get a seat on Weekends.

One of my oldest loved restaurants. After every few months I feel the  sinful desire to gorge on the chelo kabab! Time and money doesn't always help but I try to satiate my desire atleast 2/3 times a year.  Love everything about it except for the long, long and still long wait time to get a table. And can the carpet be changed? its been there for quite sometime now I guess!

Been going there for 2 & half decades now. The same ambience, same menu card, same cutlery, same red coloured sofas, same light shades hanging atop the tables, even waiters seems to those same ones. But their signature items - Chelo kebab ( rice with butter + egg + mutton seekh+ chiken kebab+ half of a steamed tomato); tandoori sizzler, prawn cocktail are the ones which draws me even now when I am in the city. Avoid going on week ends or holidays.. mad rush  people gleefully stands in queue for ages. There are plenty of new age restaurants & pubs offering better stuff.

Been there once but due to lack of time we could just taste some of the dishes and had to leave. So I will definitely visit here once again whenever will get chance. Chelo kebab and some of the desserts are on top of my wishlist. Will taste those and then edit my review.

Perhaps no Kolkatan is left who has not yet been to Peter Cat and not had their legendary chello kebabs. Decades have passed yet this place remains the same charming & sought after resturant of town. I would say its like a heritage restaurant of our city that never gets old, just gets better with age. Must try other famous dishes like prawn cocktail, chicken tetrazzini etc. Had chicken biriyani & mughlai dishes as well and they were quite decent.

Chello kebab is a hyped. Go for Chef's special chicken sizzler. We ordered both and honestly chicken sizzler was far far better. We had to wait 1 hour to get a table and that's all you need to know about the standard and class of this place . If in kolkata a Must Go place!!

The heavenly chelo kabab with a generous dollop of butter. Escorted by mutton kakori kabab and chicken kabab pieces. A poached egg over a pile of dehradun rice at centre. This item came from middle East. Shah Jahan wrote about it - If there is any paradise in this world, it's here, it's here, it's here in Peter Cat.

I was recommended by a friend to try out their Chello Kebab. I liked it a lot. It is a full meal with lovely kebabs, rice dripping with butter. So not the healthiest of food but good on the taste buds. Minus 1 for the service and the attitude of the waiters at Peter Cat. They dont have a smile, they behave like they are doing you a favour, they donot recommend and will give you an attitude, that is intolerable. I wont visit this place because the negative attitude dominates the taste of the chello kebab. The 4.0 is for the food.

One of the best dine out places in Calcutta, hands down. Right from the prime location at Russell Street to the courteous as ever staff, Peter Cat get things right. Things that matter. The only downside is the waiting time, which naturally comes with a restaurant of it's stature. 
On my latest visit, we were a group of 10. We ordered 5 Chelo Kebabs and 5 Sizzlers. The food was freshly prepared, top notch. The Chelo Kebabs have their own charm, and I'll keep returning everytime I crave a fulfilling meal.

Visited this restaurant a numerous times but this would be my first review. Peter Cat has never failed to satisfy me when it comes to food and its service. The food was absolutely delicious and fantastic in reasonable price. We ordered for tandoori sizzler, grilled fish sizzler and chelo kebab with two strawberry blossom, two mineral water, one plain rice and 2 mutton kebab. The bill came to about close to 3000rs which is not that expensive. The service was good too but for those who's visiting here for the first time, make sure that the waiting line here is long and I recommend to either book the table first or to come early and eat.

That one dish which no city offers...Chelo Kebab!!!! If you are a kebab lover this dish will redefine your love altogether. Served with juicy chicken kebabs, mutton seekh kebab on a bed of rice cooked in unique spices with a poched egg on top. The sizzler and prawns are worth a try as well. 
Living outside Kolkata gives me immense craving of this dish from time to time and thus I make it a point to visit Peter Cat everytime I am in town.

I live in Pune. I came in Kolkata for a vacation and took my family to Peter Cat for a small celebration in one fine evening. when I reached Peter cat there was Rush and they asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. it was all okay till we were offered a seat in upstairs we went up and the floor manager asked us to sit in a table which was just need to next to the stairs. I was not happy with the table and ask for alternative the manager told us all the other tables wear 7 or 8 seaters. but surprisingly our table was also a 7 seater table so I asked for a corner table which was a six seater but my manager and the other floor stuffs were hesitant. sometime later they told that it is reserved but I did not see any reservation card on the table hence I asked them to give us another corner table and unwillingly they agreed. there itself my mood went bit off. I started ordering food I was wanting some expert suggestion but floor manager was not very  willingly or happily ready to help us explaining the different items they have on menu rather they were showing busy and putting up attitude of not willing to help. I thought they might be very busy hence completed the order with whatever I understood but the result was horrible the food was not good and my family did not like it. now came the real surprise when a rich family wearing good clothes speaking English language carrying expensive accessories came in and all the managers and staffs rushed to greet and welcome them. they made them sit on the table which was booked apparently. they started chit chatting with the family and suggesting them different combination and fusion of foods. I was so surprised because they did not help us with the food the family kept asking about most of the items which was killing a lot of time for us and all the other tables. Understood they are new in the restaurant. then a point came when the manager was taking our order and one of the family member from the other table called him up and he rushed to them leaving our table in the middle of our conversation but somehow I managed to complete our dinner and left as early as possible.
My suggestion for the management of this hotel would be to Train Your stuffs to treat each and every customer equally and not to have behavioral discrimination and providing service based on how much tip the customers will give. I wish you all the best and GET WELL SOON.

I have gone a number of times there. I had ordered chelo kebab almost all the time. It is really delicious and a wholesome platter - enough to satiate your hunger. I had also tried grilled fish sizzler and tandoori broccoli. They are good but nothing beats the chelo kebab. One warning - If going on weekends, please be patient. There is quite a large crowd gathered outside the restaurant during weekends.

So we came to this place on a Saturday night and needless to say, it was jam packed! Since they do not take any reservations, you will have to come down to this place and well, wait. We had to wait for almost 40 minutes to get a table and that is usually how long it takes on any given day apparently. So be prepared!
 
Coming to the interiors of the place, it was pretty dimly lit with red being the central theme of the place. Probably like a 3/5 for the interiors!

We ordered the Tandoori chicken as a starter and hands down it was the best tandoori chicken I have ever had! It was so succulent and fresh and yummy! It was jam packed with flavours and was absolutely delightful! I will highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good starter to begin with.  

We then had the Chelo kebab, which is probably the most famous dish of this place. It's basically a big platter consisting of two pieces of mutton seekh kebab, malai chicken kebabs, aromatic rice with some char grilled capsicum and tomatoes and some butter on the side. It also had a poached egg on top of the rice. The best things on the plate were the chicken kebabs and the rice and the egg. The mutton was dry and wasn't succulent enough. Overall the platter was good but wasn't worth all the hype and I definitely won't be having it again. It's worth having once just to see what all the fuss is about, but that's about it.
  
We then had the Mutton biryani, and for someone who's a hardcore fan of the Hyderabadi style of biryani preparation, it was quite a disappointment. It was basically mutton curry and rice and had potatoes as well, which was quite unusual ( but that's how the Kolkata style biryani is made, so no surprises actually). The mutton was quite dry and wasn't succulent like the chicken was. It wasn't spicy enough and didn't have the flavours an authentic biryani should have. 

Overall, I would rate the food 3.5/5 (adding that extra .5 solely because of the tandoori chicken). It's definitely worth going once, but that's about it!

Went there on 11/07/2017  around 2pm and sat on Table Number 28. Ordered a plate of Chelo Kabab (which is supposed to be there specialty), Mutton Rogan Josh and Afgani Chicken ( For Packing) along with sprite and Naan. Well talking of look and feel the restaurant is old and has a old school kind of charm but the sofa was perky enough to cause discomfort but somehow managed it. Both of us who went there didn't consume alcohol and thus the bill amount was sufficiently less. Now coming to food quality, each and every item was probably the worst in taste and quality. The taste and quality of food items dissapointed me beyond words. How can a restaurant like this serve that kind of food? There are restaurants who serve better Chelo Kabab Platter (trust me much better than the Sh** they served) and at a lower price.

Then comes the attitude of the staffs, well never felt so insulted in my life, may be the bill amount was less, or may be we were too ordinary looking (although the dress we wore that day was normal and sober nothing fancy) or may be I ordered foods in pure Bengali (which is my mother tongue and I am not at all ashamed of using it) they simply wanted to get rid of us. as soon as our food was finished they were in a huge rush in "onek hoeche dada ebar beron toh"-type of attitude ("enough of you two, get lost now"). We were neither given hot water wash bowls nor mouth refreshments and all, I don't know why. A staff simply brought the bill and gave it to me (like they do in small road side eateries, not in a fine dine restaurant of course). We were thinking of ordering some more but none of the staffs attended us during our stay so we put down the idea of ordering anything else. On top of that after I paid my bill they were lurking around me for tips (don't know why because none of the staffs took care of us which they are supposed to, although I gave them a tip because we both wanted to get out of there and staying more was getting more insulting)

There are times when the food might be bad but went to that restaurant again just because of their impeccable behavior. but here the staffs were simply RUDE and committed to serve the tables where the bill was bound to go beyond 5k. 

The experience was simply shattering and disappointing.

Oh one thing more the packing quality is worse than street side vendors. simple aluminium foil packs in a cardboard box. I requested them to pack the food in two containers and two different boxes as the packed food was bound for two different destination. And guess what PETER CAT STAFFS gracefully did not oblige my request, as result I faced some difficulty afterwards but they did not care. Only well behaved staf was their security guard. He atleast wished me while entering and exiting as well as offered us umbrella to cab as it was raining cats and dogs.

I conclusion I would say that I would NEVER EVER visit Peter Cat again although they don't care cause losing 1 customer doesn't hit their business but this kind of attitude of staffs will definitely bring down the name in future.

And yes won't recommend anyone I know to visit here as I don't want my family members, relatives, friends  go through such a horrifying insulting experience.

No review on food/ambiance as this has been covered by so many foodies, a legendary restaurant.¬†My take is on something serious and I‚Äôm looking for official website to draw attention from the authority!

A sudden plan to taste the quintessential chelo kababs had taken me to this place but this ended to an unceremonious proceeding.¬†
Let's not get into the list of stuffs ordered and how they turned up on plate, it's always been palatable here. However what could not go down well - the bill on offing. A¬†service charge of whopping 195% imposed on a mineral water (Rs.39/- for a MRP Rs. 20/-) is cleverly going against the legal instructions, and when escalated to manager he was discordant too.¬†
For reference, please check the what is represented in red rectangle.

Despite a loud and clear declaration from govt that on MRP (nothing can be put over and above MRP value), they're still belting out to the customers - rewording the item and adding service charge to it. Central body has clearly stated that the practice of dual MRP is 'illegal' and law will be reinforced soon.

Can someone tell me their official page in comment section or someone from Petercat respond to this?

One of the most legendary restaurant of Kolkata that needs no introduction at all. Peter Cat located at Park Street has earned enough reputation from years to make this place an all time favourite for everyone.

Doesn't matter what time you visit its very common to wait outside to get a sit inside over here. So we also waited but our call came within few minutes only. Weekday simple evening it was, still 7-8 people were in the queue.

After getting into Peter Cat the ambience pleased us very well. Its dark environment & focused lights on tables is one of the kind of this place. Suddenly I noticed most of the tables were empty inside. So I thought why they aren't allowing outside people waiting to have a sit inside. Well I don't know, but seems purely marketing scheme to show the increased demand.

I was willing to visit this place for a long so the order was already decided. But their fast & excellent service surprised me. The order was...

The Legendary Chelo Kabab : Someone couldn't  just come here & go without trying their legendary dish. This place is known because of this dish & famous for its taste. What we could've ordered without this. High quality rice to grilled vegetables & kebabs everything was cooked so perfectly in this dish. But the main flavour of this dish was hidden into 2 qubes of butter. These butter qubes tasted just brilliant & its flavour was completely different than any other butter present in the market. Mixing it up with the rice & having the Kebabs with it tasted just brilliant. This is a perfect meal you can expect & get satisfied from a place like Peter Cat.

Burned Chicken Steak Sizzler : I saw every other table nearby ordering this dish so I ordered the same. This one is another speciality dish by Peter Cat. However adding burned infront of the name is what it was. Letus or cabbage whatever it was it was burned & felt really bad in taste. Boiled vegitables tasted very basic. Big chicken pieces dipped into deep soya wasn't of my taste. We also ordered bread rolls with it  that came with their awesome butter that we enjoyed.

Fresh Lime Soda : It was very basic lemon soda but refreshes the mood after main dishes.

Mixed Fruit Sundae : And at the end we ordered this sundae. It was nothing but 2 in 1 strawberry & vanilla ice cream with fine cut fruits inside. Talking about fruits it was mainly filled with papaya but mango & cherries felt nice. It was served in old class steel base & tasted very average.

Quite unexpectedly all the above mentioned items costs us Rs. 1153. I was expecting much more billed amount but they have kept the balance very well. Peter Cat is a place that is hard to ignore.

This review was long overdue. Went there for lunch during winter. We had to wait for around 15 mins before we got a table. They have 2 floors of dining space. We chose to sit on the first floor though there is'nt much difference. The place is dimly lit with well dressed staffs( kurtas and pagdi). 
Food ordered were Chello kabab(original) & chicken Marrakesh with lemonades to wash it down. Both dish came with rice and cubes of butter, chicken kebabs and inhouse sausages. The taste was really good. While the former comes with a poached egg and has a smoky flavour the latter has a cheesy after taste. Next time I want to try their sizzlers.

Ask anyone why is peter cat famous for, you would get only one answer, Chello kebab. And it goes best with a pint of beer. Now other than Chello kebab, the hidden gem of Peter Cat is mixed meat steak sizzler...served on a sizzler plate. Goes best with a pint of beer. Service good. Ambiance great. however on weekend you have to get in queue post 7pm!

One of the iconic places of Park Street. They are known for their Chelo Kebabs (one they had pioneered in the foodscape of Kolkata) along with the Sizzlers, Au Gratin & other foods. Though many may complain about the quality of food and service deteriorating as compared to yesteryears, but still worth a place to pay visit. But remember, there can be long queue outside for your turn for a table. Go as early as possible.

Peter Cat & Chelo Kabab just like Tom & Jerry.. Both these can never stay apart. But the tenderness of the Kebabs, aroma of the Mutton Roganjosh and the Greasy Biriyani topped with the fried onions are some of the things that add a feather to the cap of the restaurant....
The ambience is always pleasing with the constant sound of sizzlers buzzing around ur ears.
This time the staff was very cooperative unlike few other occasions.
Overall a must visit for every foodie & kebab lovers...

Order for grilled fish, veg biriyani, and mutton masala
Grilled fish was good, the sauce coated fish was a little bit on the sweeter side as per my taste
Veg biriyani was good.. in peter cat I find taste of biriyani like home style which I love
Mutton masala was amazing with all the spices

Finally had an opportunity to enter this old restaurant at the heart of park Street. Heard a lot about the chelo kebabas here. So wished to give it a try. Apart from that tried one chicken Irani kebab, chicken sizzler, Persian Pullao, chicken butter masala. The sizzler was good. Chelo kebab was different. Rest of the items were so so. Ambience was good. Service was fine.

Well, Patience is the key and you'll need exceptional patience here at times to wait for your turn. The rush hour wait further excerbates your hunger pangs.Marvel fans would find it less discomforting, considering their track record of being patient till the end credits ;). After almost 45 mins of wait we were able to find our way in. The place is crowded and compact but very lively. We came here for the very famous Indo Persian cuisine Chelo kebab and ordered it along with a pint of beer. Everything was so yummy on the platter from poached eggs to butter on steamed rice. The minced meat was perfectly rolled into cylindrical shape with the right amount of spice. A small bite and one could realize their culinary perfection. The tomato was baked really well and the aroma of basmati rice made me devour till the last morsel. I look forward to visit this place whenever I am in Kolkata.

What to say about this place! One of the heritage restaurants of Calcutta. The place for sizzler and chello kababs. I don't keep a count of how many times i have visited this place, but its a must for anybody visiting kolkata and going to Park st. On my recent visit we had the chello kabab and the house platter sizzler. As few of my friends were vegetarians, we also ordered the mix grill sizzler and the veg chello kabab. All of them were worth the price to pay, we had a great time again. Its still notable to say , how they have maintained the quality of the food in recent years without increasing the price that much

Tried the most talked chelo kababs, although i am a big fan of kababs but nothing that much to be found. The kababs were average and the sausages were a bit dry.  Also tried mayonise chicken, to burn the calories from mayonise chicken u have toh run for like a month... overall rating average, not going again..

After many bloggers recommendations I decided to try this legendary place, I reached the place bit early so got seat early. Now coming to food I ordered :-

1- Chelo kebab ( Signature dish) - Presentation was good and Taste was okay not too great not too bad either but the big upset here is the quantity , It was too less compare to the price you pay for it. ( 2.5/5)

2- Chicken Sizler steak - Ordered this one after reading reviews on zomato but was highly disappointed . Taste was bland and price is on higher side. (1/5)

Final verdict :-
Most overrated restaurant in entire kolkata city (2/5) . I don't understand why so much hype for this place? Except barbecue nation I don't find any decent place to eat in park street . Please correct if I'm wrong .

Located in the heart of Park Street and In the heart of the people of Kolkata is this place and the street is filled with slow hushes of people passing by with a common point of discussion CHELO KEBAB.

So we ordered the legendary Chelo kebab and 2 signature sizzlers (a veg and a roast chicken). Chelo Kebab lives up to it's status and buzz, it's a complete meal with butter flavoured rice and a few varieties of Kebab, each having a distinct wonderful taste. Sizzlers were good but one can@ definitely have better sizzlers at joints like Yoko. Sweet lime soda was a let down (too sweet) and had to be changed twice.

All in all a good place to enjoy food any day of the week. Definitely a thumbs up to this one

Came to Park Street and not been to Peter Cat? Sorry but you missed out something here. Needless to say, the Chelo kebab platter, the Bhetky Meuni√®re, these two I have tried, are worth the money paid! The place is quiet, but lively. Better to make reservations if you don't want to wait for a long time.

Probably one of the most successful and happening restaurant of the city.
My first and foremost reason for the visit was to taste their Chelo Kabab. So after a tiring practice in my tennis club, I finally decided to have a go there. After reaching there, I found a long queue outside. After 15 minutes,we finally managed to get our table in the upper floor. We opted for some light starters along with the Chelo Kabab.

At first came the Paneer Irani Kebab and both the flavour and texture were wonderful.
Same for the Afghan Chicken.
It was brilliant. The tender meat came marinated in fruit juice and blended with spices. And the Chelo Kabab-Man it was the winner dish!

Sheer nostalgia. Courteous staffs. The ambience will surely give you a soothing feel.
Hope to come here soon!

Living in kolkata for 22years....and today finally i visited peter cat...where one gets the flavour of old anglo Indian Kolkata. I thought of having some uncommon dishes. So ordered 'chicken and saussage' & 'cold chicken and salad'. Must admit...they were out of the world tasty. Just loved it. 
One must try these two.
And thia is my personal wish...they must keep more variety of animal meat and birds.

Since my childhood, I had always been hearing that Peter Cat is one of the best places for Sizzlers and Chelo Kabab in Kolkata. Yet it was off lately that I had visited the place. 
On entering here, the first thing that grabbed my attention was the d√©cor and lighting of the restaurant. The entire place was beautifully lit with dim lights and the ambience was good too. This place is famous especially because it is located in a prime location like Park street, and you will always find long queues here. The wait is lengthy and you can‚Äôt even decide to go elsewhere as Peter Cat is one of a kind. 
The Chelo kabab is perfectly prepared; starting from the rice to their Kebabs everything was delicious. The various options of Sizzlers is mind-blowing and confusing too, would love to try all.
Hope to visit this restaurant again soon.

Went there last Tuesday around 1pm with a friend .We did not have to wait and were ushered straight into the restaurant. 
What we ordered :
Mutton Seekh Kebab:
The kebabs were a bit dry. Definitely the weakest dish of the three. 
Mutton Hamburger Steak Sizzler:It was served with bread rolls and butter. The dish was very tasty, the steak was cooked to perfection. The bread rolls were also good. The best dish of the afternoon in our opinion. 
Original Chello Kebab:It had rice, butter, egg poach and kebabs. Unfortunately they did not inform us that the mutton sheekh Kebab was also given with this chello kebab platter otherwise we would have ordered a different kebab dish as starter. This time also the sheekh kebabs were dry and we had to wash it down with sprite. But barring that the dish was good. 

Verdict :The ambience was really great. There was really prompt service and very good staff behavior. Would definitely want to come back to try more of their dishes.

You can try the Tandoori Broccoli. It's an amazing food item. Also, my favourite is Chelo kababs. (Non veg) 
This is a signature food item of peter cat. You can't find any thing as delicious as this, anywhere. 
People here are very humble. Especially batch 26. What a humble man! If you're new do call him for all assistance! :)

We went there on 30th June on the occasion of my birthday. We reached there around 8:20 in the evening and were quite amazed to see a long queue as it was a Friday. Nevertheless we registered our names with the staff at the entrance and were requested to wait for half an hour. We were called upon at around 8:50 and we went inside and took our seats. The place was buzzing with people and was totally full. The ambience was excellent and the decor with the dim lights hanging form the ceiling added to the mood. Coming to the food we ordered chello kebab, grilled chicken sizzler and fresh lime soda. Considering the crowd the food came very fast,within 10 mins. The chello kebab was excellent with all the items, from the rice to the kebabs and the vegetables cooked to perfection. The butter made the rice even more tastier. The grilled chicken sizzler was also exquisite. The staff were courteous although they were a little slow perhaps for the purpose of the huge crowd. Overall an excellent birthday dinner. Looking forward to visit soon again.

One of the oldest places in park street, you will be lucky if you get in without having to wait for at least 15 minutes minimum. It's definitely worth the wait. I have been here a few times with my family.
The ambience as well as the service is awesome with two floors of seating. As for the food the chelo kabab, the mutton hamburger steak sizzler and the chicken steak sizzler are absolutely delicious. The¬†tandoori mixed grill sizzler is a must try.
This is the place to visit if you are looking for a fine and premium dining experience.

During my visit to Kolkata I stopped by Peter Cat with my mom and dad. We reached there at 11:30 am so it was completely empty. But as soon as it was 12 it started to get filled really quick.
The decor was extremely cozy and gave a very vintage feel.
We ordered:

1.Chelo kebab (as it was the most hyped dish we went for it, must say it lived up to it)

2. Chicken Marakesh ( this was similar to the chelo kebab but had different kebabs. Also I must say the kebabs in this dish tasted better than the ones in chelo kebab)

3. Tandoori mixed grill (it had a ordinary gravy with chicken lamb and prawns. It was okay. Nothing exciting)

4. Naan ( so this was definitely the highlight of the day. It was one of the best naan I have even had. Must try)

5. Sweet lime soda ( it's was okay, the quantity was less than expected)

One of the let down was the staff of the restaurant who where talking loudly right across our table which was disturbing

Altogether it was a good experience will definitely visit Peter Cat when I am in Kolkata.

I have visited this place countless times but nver gave any review. This time also I had my regular menu chicken sizzler & chello kebab. What I tried new was Prawn cocktail. Concept of this unusual appetizer is wonderful and it is a must try. They will serve u in a bowl inside which is ice, it taste a bit sour but the presence of prawn makes it delicious. This place continues to serve wonderful Iranian dishes and I will again visit this place.

I can't say enough about Peter Cat. The first restaurant I had eaten at with my own money years back still evokes a homecoming feeling in me. Even though I have tried almost everything on the menu, the chelo kebab remains my favourite. The rice platter with the glistening butter and the juicy mutton and chicken kebabs never fails to delight my palate. Nothing much to say. Just adding a picture I remembered to take and making you all salivate!üòä

I am marking it 1, because I can't mark 0. We entered one fine evening, and the first thing which irked us was late service. It was almost over 15 mins, but no one even served us water. After we complained about this to the manager, he apologized and took our order. We ordered Mutton Chello Kabab, Chicken Pakora and Chicken and Cheese Sandwich. Now we had very high hopes for the food of Peter Cat, because of its heritage and name. The Chello Kabab was what I was very excited about, but i was hugely disappointed. The mutton tasted bad, it was nothing but charred onion pieces and small pieces of undercooked mutton. The pieces were so dry and the rice had no distinct taste other than a huge blob of Butter and one egg poach on top of it. The Pakoras were nothing but a small piece of chicken wrapped in thousands of coating of flour. The fries were cold, the sandwich was cold, the pakoras were cold, and we had the worst food experiences ever. 
Lastly, it was quite funny but it was expected, we paid the bill, plus tipped the waiter. Now we were wait for the bill. But he wondered why we were bot getting up from the table. Like seriously ? Got the tip, that's why won't even bother giving us the bill back ? He asked us " Bill lagbe aapnader?", (translate : " Do you want the bill ? " ) Like, of course WE WANT IT ! WHY WON'T WE ? Was so relieved after we got out. 

If you have time and money to waste, and even your taste buds, then go for Peter Cat :) Any other restaurant would be more appetising for me.

Peter Cat is probably one of the most successful restaurants in Kolkata. There have been few times when I didn't see a long queue waiting outside the place to get a taste of the famous Chelo Kebab, be it weekdays or weekends. Of the legends in Park Street, I won't be very wrong to place this one at the top, just because of the sheer crowd it manages to pull. 

However, if you ask my opinion, I think the place is a little overhyped. Or, to put it better, the Chelo Kebab is. Almost every alternate table can be found to order one, the mutton kebabs have lost their taste over the years (or probably because of such bulk production everyday!) Some of the other dishes that still never fails to impress me are the:
1. Chicken Steak Sizzler
2. Fish Meringue
3. Chicken Irani Kabab
4. Nalli Ghosht
The Chocolate Souffle here is nothing special if you compare it to the newer places who specialise in tickling your tastebuds, but among the options available, this one is the best.

However, my last visit was particularly unpleasant because of the poor management. First of all, they made us seat in a shady corner, even though tables of four were available and we asked for one (and people before AND after us could avail those, but not us!). There was delay in taking orders, with everytime someone asking us to refer to the other person for such things. We ordered a Chocolate Souffle, someone came and said it was unavailable and instead took the order for Mango Souffle(we weren't given this option beforehand, because according to the first person, only Chocolate Souffle was available among desserts!) The manager came later to say that the Chocolate Souffle has already been prepared! I mean, what kind of a management is this, where your staff doesn't even know what is there in the menu??? Also, the staffs were extremely rude when asked to clean the table, and when I was adjusting the light to click pictures of the food, the manager came and WARNED (yes, you read that right!) me not to do it again! I am not sure if our age played a factor in their improper behaviour, but if it is so, they surely need to widen their thoughts!

They may be one of the legendary and happening restaurants in the city, but there is a dire need to look into the management. Sheer nostalgia will not make people visit it everytime, you need to treat your customers well to maintain that.

I would like to tell about good rather than the ambiance. Chelo kebab and chicken cutlet are the two dishes I have tried and both of them are superb. Simple fabulous. Everybody should try once, it is one of the heritage dinner in Kolkata, but the authorities should work on the ambiance of the place it's too old now. Need to make it more dashing for the new generation.

Peter cat is one of the oldest and well known restuarant situated in the park street area.
Its famous for its sizzlers and chello kebabs.
The ambience is average.

And also the quantity is good enough.

One of my favorite restaurants. I love the ambience. We went there mainly to have the talk of the town 'Chelo kebab'. Pre-booking table is not required. It was a small queue and we managed to get a seat within 10 minutes. Beside chelo kebab we also ordered Chicken steak sizzler and mixed raita. Chelo kebab was definitely good but I found the sizzler more yummy. And the mixed raita served as the perfect ending to our lunch. Staffs are polite and service is pretty quick. I would love to go there again to have the Chicken steak sizzler.

Heard it's one of the oldest restaurant in Kolkata and started during British period which created lots of excitement to visit this place. Went on Friday night and as expected it's crowded. We were told waiting period is 40mins and they expect us to just stand there till they call you. They shud get customer mobile no and call if they are next or so. But we decided to go around and came back after 30mins, we were on queue with two more before us. To our disappointment when our turn comes, they denied that table at top floor are available and it's only for family ( We were four guys, told them it's discrimination üòÅ ). So waited for some more time... Finally got table at ground floor after 10mins, so called non family table i guess... but many families are next to us.

Restaurant is bit crampy and have dim lights. Being old restaurant, it's acceptable. Ordered our pre decided one.. Chalo Kabab as one of the friend told it's very good. It was good and enough for a person. Price wise its affordable and worth the money.

Hearing this name for nearly two decades had increased my hopes enormously. Alas, it turned out to be quite the opposite upon visiting!
The first thing that disheartened me was the behavior and attitude of the one of the 'floor managers' who 'greeted' us on the upper floor. Seeing us as a young couple, he made us sit in a shabby corner table which was too tiny and dark. Our requests to shift to a slight better table were turned down citing reasons which soon turned out to be untrue. The service was extremely slow and inefficient. The manager without a shred of doubt behaved with hostility throughout the two-hour nightmare. We got a feeling that he wasn't interested in diners unless they appeared to be very rich. In fact, ten minutes after us, another couple arrived and they were made to sit in the lavish couch in the main dining area, which the manager had claimed to be out of service when we asked to be shifted there.
For starters, we ordered Chicken Afghani kabab. I used to think that kababs can never go wrong, but I was wrong. They tasted horrible. Tasteless, brittle and stale.
We also ordered a milk shake which was good.

Next, we ordered Beckty Meunier and Chicken Steak. The fish was amazing!!!!! The steak was average.

We decided to end the lunch with desserts, and the server said that only Chocolate Souffle was available in the day's special menu. However, we came to know that there were four more options which he didn't convey to us. Shortly after, the manager came to us saying that chocolate souffle was over, but then he refused to cancel the order saying that it was ready. The irritating part is that we had to wait for twenty more minutes by the clock before it was finally brought to us. The souffle was plainly disgusting. Literally the worst souffle I've had the misfortune of tasting.The same confusion arose with chicken steak. The manager was very impolite and antipathetic, and fed us shabby excuses for everything that we complained about.¬†
We had to wait for another fifteen minutes just to get the bill, and were rudely hasted out of the area by the same person.
Altogether, we spent a little over two hours there and a hefty bill for less-than-acceptable behavior and average food. I hope the management takes this as a wake-up call and chastens the staff for their boorish treatment of diners. Especially the part where they openly discriminate based on their assumption of the revenue that a particular group is going to generate for the restaurant.¬†
The 1.5 rating is given solely for the Beckty and the shake. So much for hospitality, Peter Cat!

Whether weekend or weekdays, this restaurant is always crowded. I had visited this place ten years ago & again revisited it a couple of months back. Both the times I had chicken sizzler & my other family members had chelo kabab. These two dishes are their speciality and a must try. What I like about them the most is their ambience.

This restaurant failed to fascinate me much except for the ambience it has being a renowned family restaurant.
Of course, I did try the Chelo kebab, but it didn't cater to my taste buds that well but maybe for most people it will be a delight.
The Malai kofta tasted so horrible, it hardly had any "malai element or paneer" seemed more like a bland potato ball in tasteless gravy.
We ordered Chicken curry and naan. The curry tasted bland.
Service wasn't very impressive. It was kind of negligent at some point.
I didn't personally feel I got value for money.

The people of Kolkata will definitely know about Peter Cat and its history of serving delicious food since decades but for the outsiders (as i myself belongs to U.P.) Trust me a trip to Kolkata would not be complete if you do not visit Peter Cat. The Chickean steak Sizzler, Chelo Kebabs and the Biryani , ummmmmmm delicious. It is so busy that people have to get seats reserved otherwise you have to que up in lines . 
Awesome place it is.

I really didn't need to write a review on Peter Cat ; there are so many already available. But I thought I will write one anyway and keep it short . My family, friends and I have been to this place so many times. Those who haven't been there , you will be amazed to see the fan-following it has. Anyway , so we went there over the weekend. We had kebabs and sizzlers and chelo-kebab ; and while we were leaving the restaurant , we found ourselves telling each other (yet again) - this place serves such great food . If only ! if only , they could pay some attention to their customer service !

Went for lunch at around 12:30 pm without pre-booking table as we were informed over phone that its on first come first serve basis . Once we reached there  , it was already overcrowded & we managed to get a seat ; then there started a long queue of customers waiting outside in the rain after around 1 pm .Ordered chelo chicken kebab - it contains in center- rice with sliced butter pieces on the top , fried egg and chicken kebabs with onions , capsicum on one side with mutton rolls/ sticks on the left side of plate , added with salad . And also ordered grilled chicken sizzlers - it had two pieces of chicken (big ~mediumin size ) coated with some sauce and along with 5-6 pieces of potato cubes . Nicely decorated with red dimlight , well served , behaviour of staffs were good .

Peter Cat is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. A lot of childhood memories are connected with this place. It has forever retained its high level of quality. Whenever I come to Kolkata visiting Peter Cat is a must. I visited with my friends. We ordered Cream of Chicken soup, House Special Sizzler, Baked Chicken, Naan, Malai Kofta and Brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Each and every dish was absolute perfect. The service was good as always. The ambience was nice and warm. The rates are also reasonable. We were three people and it came to approximately 600 rupees per head. A must visit for every foodie visiting Kolkata.

I had heard so much about this restaurant as an iconic one of Kolkata. Had an opportunity to go there during the last week. Had Chelo kabab. But it was very average. Nothing great. Then had rann. Good one. Chicken tikka kabab. Again nothing great. I keep travelling to different parts of India. I would say the service and the food was just average as compared to other renowned restaurants in other cities of India. Not impressed with the service at all. I  know that my friends from Kolkata would not agree to my review but sorry. Peter Cat was not at all impressive to me.

The ambience and the food was really good. So was the service. I had chello kebab there and it was (as promised) fantastic. The chicken amd mutton kebab Lying in the bed of buttery rice tasted like heaven in my mouth. For dessert i had brownie with hot chocolate sauce. The brownie had a spongey texture amd the sauce was rich and the ice cream on top of the brownie worked miraculously well. To sum it up my experience in peter cat was laudable.

Peter Cat is a place where a lot of childhood memories are attached to. Eating out during our childhood mainly meant going out to Park Street for dinner or lunch. And peter cat has always been a favourite. My mother loves the chello kebab here and my personal favourites are their chicken steak sizzler and grilled fish sizzler. All other items here are absolutely delicious. Try their prawn cocktail , beckty meunier, fried fish with tartare sauce and fish fingers along with their famous chello kebab and sizzlers.

The quintenssial part of being in Kolkata is that you have to nibble onto the bits and pieces of Chello Kabab of this place . Decor of this place takes me to back to the porsche restaurants of pre independent times when British were there . I had Chello Kababb like the crowd which was tummy filling to a great level . Nothing else to say as it had to be an experience in regards to food as well as ambience however just wana give them a tip of expanding the business as waiting for one hour becomes tiring . I do understand on weekends the scenes are like this however would like some comforting gesture from the management . Would look forward to have sizzlers and other delicacies next time .

This is my 2nd visit to this place. Though it was a weekday but the restaurant was full but we got a table without waiting anyway. I like both the ambiance and food there. The staff are well-mannered and helpful. Though it was 8 o'clock and the restaurant was full but the food was delivered shortly. Big thing when you are hungry and food is delivered shortly not letting you wait a long. We ordered for 1. cream chicken sweet corn soup - not so good. 2. Chicken Irani kabab - awesome 8pcs. 3. Bhetki muniari - best. 4. Tandoori mixed grill Sizzler - good (one pc prawn, chicken, paneer and probably mutton, liver) 5. Chicken steak Sizzler - awesome except the sauce it is prepared with and with plenty of potatoes(don't like that much potatoes). 6. Peter cat special ice cream - fav, awesome. I choose Irani kabab and bhetki muniari after seeing the review and its really worth paying for the dishes. Peter cat made my evening and thanks for that. I will visit you again.

Good but not that great as hyped. Too much waiting time and no proper waiting place, you need to wait on road in one of the busiest section. Food is great but service people need to be more humble. They need to be more careful about aged and children. Ambience is conventional nothing out of the world types. We went specifically for chelo kebab which was indeed good. Finding parking around the restaurant is big headache.

Tried the popular chelo kabab- it was overwhelming and also a big meal.
Fish fingers and fries: made with parse fish rather than traditional bhetki. Was not bad considering the mayo was good.
Fresh lime soda: okayish
Souffle of the day(mango): good and too much after a big meal.
Ambience : depends on the table you get.
Service: fast and efficient.
Price: A bit on the higher side but understandable considering the location.

I went to Peter Cat on the recommendation of my Bengali friend and I had three dishes from there

Cream of spring chicken - 3/5
Chelo kabab - 2.5/5
Brownie with vanilla icecream - 3.5/5

I felt the soup wasn't creamy enough eventhough it tasted good. The chelo kabab was what I was disappointed with. I am a person who loves his kebabs hot and the kebabs were only served warm likenit was kept out for 10 mins after cooking. The brownie and icecream was great. They have a very good ambience and great customer service. I was later told by my friend that I should have tried the house special rather than chelo kebab but unfortunately I didn't get the time.

Have been here a couple of times and the food is lip smacking out here whether you order the all time popular Chelo Kabab, chicken steak sizzler or just fish and chips!! The staffs are very courteous and polite. The only drawback I have found is that you always have to wait for a table for quite some time..especially if it's a weekend. But honestly, the wait is worth it.

This heritage food place selling it's signature kebab platter under the name 'chelo kebabs' for Rs 355(in chicken) probably makes it's way to the top 10 dishes that anyone in Kolkata would definitely like to try!
The platter comes with a decent portion of warm rice with 3 cubes of butter, topped with thepst perfectly poached egg, a side of 2 soft chicken seekh kebabs and 5 pieces of chicken tikka kebabs along with roasted bell peppers and onions which are perfectly seasoned. 
Note - Since the waiting time is about 20 minutes, it's advisable that you pre book the seats here! Pocket pinch would be 1000 for two people.

Serves the best sizzlers in town and famous for their Chelo kabab. The ambience and decor gives a typical 90's feeling of a top class restaurants that we see in movies with dim lighting, the crockery and the staff. Now coming back to the food it is the best available in town and is the benchmark. The only negative is after having the kabab your calorimeter will rise exponentially with so many butter cubes in the plate which is intrinsic to the kabab platter and is thus unavoidable. The kababs are soft, juicy and perfectly cooked with the right blend of spices and herbs. Apart from the food you need to experience the ambience, the crowd and the coziness of the place which is why it is Peter Cat.

Before I rate this place, I want to clear out something. I am not the kind of person who will trash a restaurant's ratings because of factors like service and ambience. I might give it less than what I would based on their dishes. Some people feel that dining at a restaurant is an experience and factors other than the delicacies, like ambience, service would equally contribute to the overall experience. This is something I agree with, what I don't agree with is considering the entire experience a failure, just because one of those two failed to deliver. Hence Read on...

Over the last year I have visited Peter Cat a total of 6 times. For a person who spends eight months away from Calcutta that is a lot! I have slowly started realizing a few things about their service.
Firstly they will treat you according to the potential bill amount! They discriminate on the basis of clothes, jewellery and accessories. An excessive and overtly display of wealth is sure to get you a good service.¬†

I visited Peter Cat today, the 12th of June 2017 with a close friend. Firstly there are two types of service personnel in Peter Cat, one is for taking order another is for delivering food, looking after needs etc. The former wears a suit and the latter kurta-pyjama. I have always seen a suit-wearing guy take an order. Today however, sensing that we are students, a suit-wearing guy sent one of the kurta clad waiters to take our orders. I had no problems with that. He was a young guy and I liked him.¬†But he was not even allowed to serve us properly. The same suit wearing guy interrupted him while he was serving us and sent him to fetch the orders for more "wealthy customers" from the Kitchen. What is even more amusing, he didn't even offer to serve it himself in the absence of the kurta clad ¬†guy. Instead he went a safe distance back and proceeded to eavesdrop on our conversation.¬†
The total bill amount was 1.9 thousand and I don't think it's possible for two people to bring up a bill amount higher than that unless they order alcoholic beverages.¬†
Coming to ambience even though I like the small halogen-lit lanterns focusing on the table, a lot of people including my friend found it dark and gloomy. We had occupied a table meant for two and not only did the chairs creak a lot but the table oscillated vigorously at the slightest disturbance. They badly need to replace them.¬†

Then comes the food. We had ordered Chicken Cocktail Sausages, Dum Ki Raan, Chicken Steak, Chelo Kebab Platter, and Fresh Lime Soda.
There is a huge problem with the consistency of cooking. While the sunny-side-up on my friend's Chelo Kebab platter was completely fine, mine had an overdose of salt! And you can literally feel the difference in each of the sausages! One is stiff, another is extra soft, one is overcooked while another is under-cooked! The chef couldn't even cook the Sausages in an even manner?¬†
The reason why foreign brands like Chilli's and TGI Friday's are making a mark in the city's food landscape is because they ensure a hospitable staff. The staff is trained to be welcoming, polite and most importantly non-judgemental. They ensure that people, irrespective of their economic status are treated well!¬†

So why am I rating this place four ? Firstly the food is genuinely great here. Apart from one or two stray incidents you are bound to enjoy the food. Secondly this is a heritage landmark in Calcutta's food map. I wish them all the best in continuing that legacy. Thirdly they are a part of a lotof my childhood memories and hence I am going to be soft on them despite facing a poor treatment at their hands.Signing off hoping for a better experience in the future!

Yes , it is a legendary restaurant and it has also managed to keep its consistency in everything good and bad. Be it the taste or the crockery, it is still what it was donkey years back. It seems time has stopped for this place . No change in taste is an excellent thing , but no change of the plates and glasses, is taking the 'consistency'  thing a little too far. 
The waiters also seem to be the ones who were hired  when the restaurant had opened , they are old , slow and arrogant . 
It definitely does serve one of the best sizzler  but the age old, dirty crockery and the rude, unfriendly staff is what is pulling the standard down .
Overall the place has zero class and standard but does serve the best sizzler and chelo kebab which is the only reason the place is jam packed at any given time and probably that's the reason the owners are not bothered to make changes because they know that people are going to flock in for their legendary dishes .

This legendary restaurant situated at heart of Park Street has maintained all its glory through the years. Known widely for it's signature Chelo Kebab, it doesn't disappoint when it comes to the other dishes in the menu. Having already tried Chelo Kebab previously (which we found to be average), we decided to go with Chicken Marakesh, a variant of the Chelo Kebab. We also ordered Butter naan and Chicken Korma. I found Chicken Marakesh to be much more delicious than its more popular counterpart. This dish has half a stuffed roasted potato instead of the fried egg, which by the way tasted amazing. Both the kebabs were delicious and the herb rice served with cubes of butter had a nice fragrance to it. The naan was nice and fluffy, and a good accompaniment to the excellent Chicken Korma. The ambience is good, it's cosy and comfortable and a gives an old world vibe. Service too was good. Might be a little heavier on the pocket when it comes to the Indian dishes compared to other places.

We went there with lots of expectation for a fine dining experience but unfortunately we were disappointed.
We went there in the evening and it was almost empty.
Firstly there were two of us (teenagers) so the manager showed us to a two sitter which had a very small table that too at the far end corner of the room.
There was barley any space for two big plates.
So we requested that if we can shift to a bigger table as it was problematic for us.
The manager stated that those tables are for three and four sitters and we cannot shift there, while two people (elder) occupied a four sitter just in front of us and the rest of the four sitters were empty as it wasnt during the rush hour.
I requested the manager once again saying the table is too small but the manager started arguing that two sitter tables are small and its the standard size.
Then we ordered for strawberry blossom, chello kebab and chicken steak sizzler. The blossom was decent and the chello kebab and sizzler were average nothing extra ordinary. There are places who provide more delicious Chello kebabs.
Anyway when our food arrived there was no place to shift the plates even a little.
I dropped my fork twice as there was no place at all to keep them while im not using it and asked to replace it but the second time they said they cannot replace it anymore.
Then I had to eat without a fork.
Then I wanted to order another pineapple blossom but like I said earlier our table was at the far end no one was attending our table they were standing far away and I literally had to shout in the restaurant to get their attention.
This thing happened twice while ordering the dessert as well.
Finally we ordered chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce.
The dessert was the only item I really liked so I gave 2/5 instead of 1/5.
I am hugely disappointed with their service.
Just cause we are less in number and that our bill will be less compared to larger groups or families,doesnt mean that you can ignore our hospitality and treat us as if you are doing a huge favour by serving us.
There are far better places at park street with lesser expense.

Very poor service. I have been going to Peter cat since I was a kid for cheap kebabs and sizzler. Past few years every year the service and food quality have deteriorated. The waiters have some sort of union where they make a lot of faces if you ask they for anything extra. But most importantly they have stopped providing extra gravy on sizzlers, the patties are very dry and they even refuse to acknowledge it. Again ordered today same crap.

Located near Park Street metro station.

Known for their famous CHELO KABABS.

Had been there yesterday.

Food ordered - LIME SODA, MUTTON CHELO KABAB, TANDOORI MIXED GRILL SIZZLER .

*Tips 1- If you want to taste their best chelo kababs then DON'T go for their chelo kabab(the original) and instead go for the Mutton Chelo kabab.trust me it works.

*Tips 2-Try to give a visit around 11am-12pm as then you won't have to wait for the tables.

Besides these its a nice food joint.Ambience is great.It reminds you of Old Calcutta.Nice place to take your partner on a date (jz kiddin)...üòã

I visited this place to taste Chelo Kebab which was really tasty. This is the most famous dish which is a must try if you visit for the first time. You won't be disappointed. 
Also tried sizzler- Grilled chicken,  which was tasty too. 
Had Biriyani which was okay.  
The ambience is good and staffs were good and attentive. 
Besides,  this place is always crowded so a minimum of 30mins wait is normal if you're visiting for dinner. But the food is worth waiting for. 
Everyone visiting Kolkata must visit this place.

I've been to this place pretty often. The Chelo Kebab as everyone knows, is fab. More than the kebabs, I love the taste of the rice n butter. The sizzlers are also good. However, I didn't like the prawn cocktail much. The ambience is nice, service is good, though sometimes they might rush you a bit, as the place almost always has a long queue outside.¬†I had a question though. Can anyone suggest me a good veg dish over here? I wanted to try the vegetarian menu of Peter Cat once, but am clueless as to what will be good. Any help?

The aroma, aspect and savour of the Chelo Kebab says it all.
Peter Cat takes you retrograde to the world of restaurants.
The ambience is evocative and adorned with dim bulbs that give you ample light to just focus on food.
The turban wearing waiters also remind of the olden era.

The Chelo Kebab is appetizing in every aspect.
The Buttered Rice perfectly complements the tenderly cooked Mutton Kebabs and nicely done Chicken Kebabs. The poached egg is the cherry on the top.
The Chelo is a complete meal in itself and a single portion is adequate for an adult to feed his(or her) hunger.

**And yes there is extra scoop of butter just in case you think your meal is less buttery.

Food - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5

Unarguably the most hyped/famous restaurant in Kolkata and Arguably the best In Kolkata.

No matter what day you choose to go to this place , you will need to consider a 30min - 1 hour of waiting time. So its better not to even think of this place when you are damn hungry. Usually a place frequented by people who come to celebrate some occasion or a pre planned visit.

Service and Hospitality at this place is amazing which is a rarity in Kolkata's restaurants. In here , its top notch...

Coming to the food quality. The most famous thing served at this place is Chelo kababs. Now its good , no doubt. But there is nothing to go all guns blazing telling everyone how awesome it was. The kababs served here are good..period...nothing extra ordinary. More than the kababs , i liked the aroma of the properly cooked rice that was served along with the kababs and the basil and parsley flavor within it. ¬†Talking about other dishes on the menu , practically tasted all kinds of kababs , tandoori items and platters and frankly they were a bit heavy on the pockets.

I have been to this place quite a few times mostly on some or the other kind of celebration , be it someone's birthday or anniversary and frankly if you have bong friends and relatives , you have to come over to this place whether you like it or not...Based on my frequent visits , i would say the taste of most their dishes , and the famous chelo kababs even are inconsistent....A good eating joint / restaurant always maintains consistency and standard....¬†

Well India is a place of lot of over hyped things.....More so in Kolkata i have found. This is one such place. The hospitality is fine....the service is great...VM , Look and Ambiance all ok(which any good restaurant would have or should have in the first place anyways) , taste is good(nothing great or which can be proclaimed a hallmark of this place) , and a bit expensive.

An iconic restaurant since long , Peter Cat needs no introduction to the elite group of foodies.
The quality of all the components and their flavours are complementary to one another and the harmony holds the entire dish together. 
We chose this place on a friends recommendation. 
After a wait of about 15 minutes and talking about the delicious food it had, we finally got to go inside and try the food ourselves.
.The other veg preparations too were good enough.
The Creme Caramel¬† was quaint and smooth on the palate.The quantities of each preparation was ample enough to be shared between two.
Overall it was a good experience.

Ordered Beckty meunier and Chelo Kebab. I ofcourse do not have anything new to comment upon the food that is served at Peter Cat. 
However, one expects the boiled vegetables and sauce tossed potatoes to actually be warm and not stone cold. 
Same goes for the chelo. 
A tasty , cold meal which wasn't a salad. 
But hey who cares about providing warm food when you have people line up everyday in two shifts wanting  to be served by you. 
Service was good though.

Been here many times since I was a kid, with parents, relatives, friends, on a date and enjoyed it every single time. ¬†There is a reason why there is always a queue in front of their door, and that reason is the Chelo kebab. House special sizzler also deserves a special mention. Do not forget to end your meal without brownie with hot chocolate sauce.¬†
Love the dim lighted ambiance, the decent service and the food- this place evokes happy memories and I would surely visit Peter Cat again.

Dim lightings, well dressed staff! This place seems to be very different in Calcutta. Tried their famous chelo kebab. It comes with two types of kebabs, rice and egg. Everyone visiting Calcutta should try this once as it is one of the dish recommended when you visit Calcutta. Do try it! 
Only drawback-prices are little on a higher side!

I believe this is the best restaurant in Calcutta to visit with your friends and family. After trying out several food joints for a proper Birthday lunch, and got so fed up that finally for last 4 years decided to visit Peter Cat only. Being a foodie and having utmost interest in visual arts, I never forget to take a picture of the dish wherever I went, but this is probably the only place where the smell and presentation of their food challenges my unruly gluttony from having a proper behaviour. And every time I engulfed myself with the food and forgot to take a snap. Luckily I have only a picture of Chicken Marakesh and will recommend all to taste their brownies with vanilla ice cream, since they serve the hot chocolate in an impressive amount in a separate container, which escalates the taste. Even I admire their Persian Rice which they serve with shredded Paneer. I promise to upload more pictures mainly of the Chocolate Brownie in my next visit.¬† If you are a visitor to this beautiful city, make sure you visit Peter Cat for their food and hospitality.

1) Food taste was not that great. We ordered chelo kebbab and found the kebbbabs and tikkas to be dry. Chilli chicken peices were too small and covered with a thick flour coating.
2) Dirty and poorly maintained restaurant. The red light all over just helps hiding all the dirt and dust. If observed carefully one can actually see the dirty carpets, broken shutters, dirty cutlery...
3) Overall I felt that it's just a hyped place. does not worth all that waiting and taste of food is just normal like any other normal not so hyped restaurant.

I'll keep it short. I find their classic chelo kebab overhyped. I really love their chicken steak, house special chicken steak, tandoor mixed grill sizzler. I recently tried their fried beckty with tartare sauce and it wasn't bad. I've tried their indian menu as well. Not bad really!

Juicy kebabs with that butter rice was simply out of the world.
Prawn Butter Masala had the most succulent prawns I ever had.
The Tandoori roti was soft.
And the dessert was great too.
The staff was courteous
The decor was quite good as we sat on the top part of the restaurant.
Overall had a wonderful experience.

I have been here twice. Had their famous mutton chello kabab once, and then a minced mutton steak another time. Whoever told these guy that they can bake a steak!! I mean what audacity!! It was the worst I have ever had, and I have been around the world a bit. And how could you even call that a steak?!! If you've had kababs in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, you'd know that their Chello kabab is no big deal either. Below average. Their steaks, aaahh! That's just an insult to the dish, and your palette. Sadly, this is true of most so-called continental food in Kolkata. When here, stick to traditional Bengali food in the pricier places (e.g., Oh! Calcutta), and the odd biriyani. And some standard Punjabi food, which is just about acceptable in one or two places. Period.

I have mixed opinions about this restaurant; on the first occasion, my colleague and I ordered the most famous dish in their menu...yes, the Chelo Kebab! Though the chicken kebabs were nothing extraordinary, I quite like the herbed rice. It was the basic reason why I ordered it once again after a couple of months when I went there with a larger group of colleagues. This time the rice didn‚Äôt have any flavour of herbs like parsley, and tasted like plain buttered rice. The chicken kebabs too were bland, completely devoid of any taste whatsoever.....I actually felt like chewing sawdust! Some months later, one of my acquaintances went there to have the Chelo Kebab; his feedback was okay. In view of such diverse experiences, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that consistency is an issue over here......I suppose it all boils down to how the cook performs on that particular day!!

It was a treat from a friend, pre booking of table is not allowed so we had to wait for around half an hour to get inside as it is a really busy place. The ambience is good but isn't it too dim and gloomy... so coming to the food chelo kebab is really over rated and they serve butter cubes alongside it üòü!?... next we ordered mixed sizzler which is passionately recommended in the menu but it was really spicy but overall good... its good for people who love spicy and heavy Indian food... but they should really do something about the people waiting outside, maybe a place to sit as the place is really bustling, there were around 50 people waiting along with us. Enjoyüòä

Mr. Peter's Cat!! This Cat is sweet and really tasty. One of the most famous food destinations of Kolkata that will never disappoint you.

The Cat finds his place in the midst of food hub at Park Street. We did not experiment much and went for the signature dishes. Chelo Kabab and Chicken Steak Sizzler was at our order list. Although Chelo Kabab and Sizzlers are available at other places, but still I found these items a tad unique at the Cat.

The decor and light give you a cosy feeling. Staff are courteous.

This cat will draw your attention and you will soon be in love with this place!!

Recommended for a single visit at least !!

Peter Cat has been one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Went there on a week day for lunch it was mainly crowded by office people.They serve alcohol but only in downstairs seating area. The seating arrangements were not to my liking. The menu is overall same. Their speciality is Chelo Kabab which is still good. They have satisfactory choices for alcohol. If you visit the place then must have Mutton dopiaza with tandoori roti. Which is a really mouth watering delicacy. Peter Cat's house special sizzler is an obvious thing to grab. They don't have a good dessert menu which is needed to be rectified. Overall good and we will like to visit the place again.Sayan Ganguli

Been years since u have been visiting this place but they still havent been able to manage the queues.
But i have finally discovered the reason for the queues.
Its only because
1)they take time to take the order
2)more time to serve you your food.The rose nicely decorated on the table crosses your mind several times and you have to stop yourself from eating it up.
3)Finally when you finish your meal the time to give the bill simply kills you.

We took 2 different sizzlers.
Vegetarian steak was thoroughly disappointing.Too much of soya sauce used.Not hot either.
Mixed grill was the saviour.

Chilly babycorn was way too much soaked in oil.

Overall, disappointing..

A place that is extremely famous for its Sizzlers and Chelo Kebab Platter. The Non-Veg chelo kebab is an absolute delight. I have tried and tasted chelo kebab at so many places, but nothing matches Peter Cat's standard. Tandoori Mized Grill is my hot favourite at Peter Cat. It come without any rice or noodle. One star less because of th waiting time and that they do not allow you inside unless you have the full group present. Its like, if you are 5 people and 4 have arrived, they won't allot you the table unless the 5th one is present.

Regarding the service , this place should be rated 5. I once ordered for caramel custurd, which tasted a bit bitter . Though i didnt complain but the manager somehow came to know by reading my facial expression that i was unhappy with the food.He personally came to me and asked if i had any problem with the food, and soon after i told him that the caramel custurd tasted a bit bitter he went to the kitchen with the chef n looked into the matter and later offered me a diffrent desert dish which was yummilliicious. I was happy how they treated the customer as the king. Will love to visit as many times as i can .

I had been here a few times before and I do miss being there again but pocket constrains do me injustice.
Like the Bengali I am, my most memorable dish from here is their Chello Kebab Platter which is an absolute meal on its own. The quality of all the components and their flavours are complementary to one another and the harmony holds the entire dish together. The kebabs are the stars and I think no one can doubt me over that. The desserts and ice creams too are immensely popular and can be the fantastic final stroke to one's hearty meal.

But the chelo kabab was really good and so was the cold chicken salad:)The butter naan was one of the best that i have ever had as it was awesomely soft and great:) The food was quite filling as they have a good quantity. The ambience and seating arrangement was also very cozy and comfortable. Even though we went in the rush hours, we dint have to wait a lot(hardly 15mins). The service was also good and so were the mocktails:) Would love to come here again and try other stuff:)

I have grown up in this locality and anyone born and brought up in this locality of Kolkata would surely be a foodie by nature!

You get the best of continental, Muglai, Indian and Chinese to say the least, around Park Street!

Coming back to Peter Cat! A restaurant owned by Nitin Kothari (His elder bro Baba Kothari owns opposite lane of restaurants, except Oasis and the Mantoshs)! 

It is known for its signature dish, Chelo Kabab! Every food has a story:  What happened is that the kebab sales picked up much more and this particular dish, Chelo Kebab, started dominating. The owner had to get a second tandoor, then a third and a fourth to take the load. 

Traditionally, kebabs are north Indian dishes and eaten with naan. No one eats kebab with rice; it‚Äôs just not done! But we the people in Calcutta like rice too, so the combination of rice with kebabs with poached egg or fried egg. A combination of chicken and mutton kebabs, rice, eggs‚Ä¶ and who doesn‚Äôt like butter? So that went in too. And that‚Äôs how the Chelo Kebab came about. 

Ever since it became popular, many other restaurants have tried to copy it but the original still beats all by a mile!

I don't know why people go gaga about the food served in Peter Cat because when I visited this place I was extremely disappointed with the food quality and texture. In Celo Kebab the rice was okay with the butter and the reshmi kebab was okay too also we ordered Tandoori chicken which had honey poured on it and the worst part was it was dry or overcooked. The only thing I loved in Peter Cat was the drinks I ordered. The Cocktails were yummy.

I have been here quite a few times. And everytime the food here has successfully satisfied the foodie in me. Chello kebab is always worth mentioning, all the three types, chicken, mutton and veg. But if u r visiting peter cat, do order the tandoori broccoli and the nentara as well. But the place is rather too dingy, they should really make it well lit and provide a cleaner environment to dine in.

An iconic restaurant since long time of Kolkata, Peter Cat needs no introduction to the elite group of foodies.
Located opposite to The KFC outlet in Park Street, rarely a time goes by when u don't find people awaiting in the long queue.We had to wait for 30mins to book a table of 4.
The orders consisted of the Iconic ChickenChelow kabab , Veg chelo kabab, chilli Baby corn and Veg Biriyani(due to a friend being veg).
The chelo kabab consisted of Rice in butter, salads ,Fish kabab and chicken kabab which were all heavenly in taste.
The Veg kabab consisted of Paneer kabab,veg kabab rice in butter and salad. The amounts were sufficient for one.
However the only disappointment was we ordered Grilled chicken platter and we were served Fish platter which was not at all upto the mark as the fish tasted raw and a bit smelly.
Being too full we had no space left for any dessert which we plan to devour in the next time we visit ..

We chose this place on a friends recommendation. After a wait of about 15 minutes and talking about the delicious food it had, we finally got to go inside and try the food ourselves. We ordered chela kebab platter and sizzlers. Both.of.them.were.amazing!!! Especially the platter. Loved it, it was minimal but the flavours were separately noticeable. An good experience for travellers visiting Kolkata. Must try place.

The feel of retro Kolkata the flavour of Park Street amd the divinity of the ambience is beautifully astounding. The food is nothing short of class with the all favourite Chello kabab and sizzlers being on top of the chain and too add up on that the cocktails are simply amaizing. P.S. If you are a whiskey lover go for the whiskey sour and thank me later...

I came from Delhi for a vacation. Seven years later I visited Peter Cat, I deeply regret to see the condition of the restaurant. I was glad that I was at the restaurant at its best times. Now I feel pity. The manager seemed quite unwelcoming and the staff was very unenthusiastic. The moment we entered the restaurant the manager somehow made a gesture of not getting us a seat as it was reserved. It was so obvious as he was grumbling something to the security personal and we overheard this grumpy conversation. My husband who is on his maiden Kolkata tour and doesn't understand Bengali was also moved by this gesture and asked me to get to another restaurant nearby. But as this is one of my old memories best pick, I decided to stay. We finished the horrible food, the service person stood infront of us and he was not at moving at all. It was so irritating. We paid him and then he let us breath.

Ever since the Mocambo debacle, Peter Cat has enjoyed higher foot-falls and the saga continues till date. Expect to saunter in at or after 8 in the evening and you will be asked to wait for a minimum of 15 minutes. ¬†
The restaurant has maintained the quintessential posh Park Street eatery ambiance since it's very inception and it is this that warrants repeat customers.¬†They were the first to introduce the Chello Kebab to the scene and it is this dish that people order the most, of course. I remember, it was the dish we had ordered on my first visit to the newly opened Peter Cat with my parents as a kid and it is the same dish that I ordered last week when I went there to give a treat to a friend.¬†Some things don't change and that is the beauty of this place. The buttery rice, the succulent kebabs the slightly oily bull's eye egg are all the same on the plate of chello! There are other items on the menu, of course, but this is a paean to the signature dish.

Peter cat ..a much visited restaurant during my growing up years was revisited with friend and family. Though a week day had to wait almost an hour to enter. Could have gone to the adjoining restaurants but wanted to give my son an experience of chelo kabab. We ordered mocktails..refreshing after such a long wait. Then came our prawn cocktail...it could have been better. At last arrived our chelo..always a vision in its way of being served. The sunny side up on top of the butter rice..makes my mouth water. The kababs could have been more succulent. All in all not a bad experience.

We went for a family lunch yesterday to this place....The Ambiance and presentation on table was quite impressive. We ordered for Chicken Asparagus Soup, Chelo Kebab and Chicken Steak Sizzler. Among all of these, Chelo Kebab was the best, Soup was not something very special, since I actually do not prefer continental Soups much, Sizzlers were really nice. Overall everything was good, nothing to mention about the Quality and presentation, behavior of staff, ambiance, e.t.c, however the only two things which I must say is the Quantity of food and the price they charge for that much. Though we had to wait for around half an hour for getting a table as it was not pre booked, and being a sunday, it was over crowded, however they managed well and so out overall experience was quite good and can suggest for a visit to people who love to eat these dishes.

An overhyped eating joint. Food is good but nothing out of the world. The place is really claustrophobic. There is hardly any room to move around. If you have kid then don't even bother to think about this place , they will not even allow your kid to get down. The managers need to improve their attitude. There are far better places in park Street than this one

A dear friend's anniversary treat landed me and my girl gang here.Willing as we were to indulge,we went with a potpourri of staples as well as experimented with some other preparations on the menu.To begin with we ordered,Fresh Lime Soda,Bread Rolls,Chello Kebab original,Veg Chello Kebab,House Special Sizzler,Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler,Mixed Vegetable Sizzler,Iced Coffee with Ice cream and Creme Caramel.As for the non vegetarian dishes,each preparation was topped with a poached egg,The Chello kebab original,somewhat lives up to to its hype,as the chicken kebab it offers is beautifully seasoned and cooked;however the seekh kebab in the platter tastes rather bland.The House Special Sizzler didn't quite impress me,as the sauce it had,came with an overpowering smell of ground coriander,whereas the Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler was quite good.The other veg preparations too were good enough.The Creme Caramel ¬†was quaint and smooth on the palate.The quantities of each preparation was ample enough to be shared between two.Overall it was a good experience.

Nice restaurant, people in Kolkata unanimously recommend this place. Hard to get in as it has a perennial queue outside. We got in as it was off hours, the food was good, we had chicken marrakesh and chelo kebab. Both dishes were balanced flavoursome and tasty. It is not spicy but it is great! The ambience and the food have no connection, the service is OK not great. Overall it was above average but may not be worth the kind of waiting time these guys have.

Came here on a Saturday night at 8:15. Was told there was a wait of 1/2 an hour. Finally got in at 9:45. Waited for over two hours for two simple dishes (supposedly the specialities) The food was delayed because someone else got my order. I know this because the table next to mine got their food in 15 mins flat (same order). The Bhekti was okay. The mutton chelo was burnt to cinders on the corners. Inedible for the most part. After all that, the waiters hanging around expecting a tip post that. And the mood lighting is because the floor is FILTHY.

I must have eaten umpteen times at Peter Cat when I used to live in Kolkata but never reviewed them as Zomato was a non entity. Things have since changed and hence here goes a review. The ambience is pretty similar to its cousin across the road Mocambo. The seating arrangement though is a mite different.

This afternoon meal was a total chello kebab bonanza. We tried both the chicken and the mutton chello kebab offerings. For the uninitiated chello kebab is a dish unique to Peter Cat which is an offering of seekh kebabs and the Reshmi variety served on a bed of white rice with butter, a fried egg and some veggies. If that hasn't got you licking your chops then I suggest you make your way to Peter Cat and try one of these dishes. Guaranteed to bring a satisfied sigh out of you.

Thanks to the management for maintaining the standards of food and service although the washroom needs serious maintenance and in my book that counts for a half point deduction but I have let it go as I absolutely loved my food. Trust the feedback will be taken care of.

Cheers,

After a long wait, we finally visited the place. It has an amazing aura with its unique Pathani grandeur. The waiters who were also dressed in long Pathani tunics and impressive turbans, appeared to be very energetic and courteous. 

The interior was dim and entire place smelled of excellent flavours. Our table had a nice little lantern that helped set up an awesome ambience. 

We had ordered for Chicken Cream of Asparagus soup, Chicken Irani Kabab and Chelo Kabab-The Originals. Everything was mindblowing and each dish had a distinct tinge of exclusivity. The Chelo was absolutely fit for king. The various kababs and the rice with butter won our hearts and tickled our hungry soul. 

A definite try in my list. However note that, if you are visiting the place during weekends, do expect some waiting time outside the restaurant.

Had visited this place a long time ago.. tasted their chelo kebab and chicken marakesh.. Both of which are their signature dishes... so would review about my latest visit to this legendary restaurant...

Decided to revisit this place after a long time on the eve of my birthday celebration on 17th May 2017.. The ambience of this place is as usual very classy.. those dim red lights hanging over the tables.. With those chairs and the simple yet elegant walls will mesmerise you apart from their delicious lipsmacking foods..

Coming to the food.. Had a couple of budweiser pints to start our meal with.. those were served with complimentary snacks... 

Then came the show stopper dish the "Tandoori mixed sizzler".. actually I am a die hard fan of sizzlers.. be it veg or non veg the aroma and the sizzling sound of the dish just drives me crazy... It was just delicious.. I still can feel that aroma while reviewing it after 24 hrs..üòÄ it was a combination of prawn.. A slice of paneer.. Two small lamb steaks.. One large chicken breast piece.. and a medium lamb piece.. The gravy was just heavenly.. you will just smack ur tongue and lips for a long time... 

Then ordered the biriyani ala nawabi.. ie the mutton biriyani... though it was quite different from the normal kolkata style with some fried onions less spicy and a diifernt aroma... but it was good.. and after having the sizzler it's more than enough for two... With 3 small pieces of mutton which was soft and juicy.. 

Was thinking of having some dessert but trust me you won't have a bit of space left after having the two dishes... 

P.S the prices have increased not the same as shown in menu.. A difference of maybe 40 ro 50 rs in each dish..

The most important thing is that we didn't have to wait this time..üòÄ  maybe my birthday special...

First of all, the staff was very arrogant and eager to leave! Most of the food was very sweet and the ambience was okay. The tomato and minestrone soups had the same base and they were excessively sweet. The kebabs were the best part with the Reshmi being extremely tender and succulent.The staff seemed a bit inexperienced.Both the main course dishes(chicken butter masala and nentara)were also very sweet. Overall the food was very sweet and the staff was extremely arrogant and in a hurry to leave.  I have given 1.5 only because of the kebabs,otherwise I would have given Peter Cat only 1. Not going to visit again...in the near future. Very disappointed.

Quintessential Chelo Kebab take on Peter Cat , this has remained the mantra for many restaurant goers on Park Street. Ambience , food and the 1970s decor has carved a niche for itself among vintage food dens. Sizzlers are no less beauty. Over all any day at Peter Cat for one sumptuous brunch is a great idea !

Well we decided to visit the most popular, oldest, legendary restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday as well as one of my another friends anniversary. This was our 1st visit and without any thought we decided to order their signature dishes - chello kabab and sizzlers. I was totally in love with their ambience as well as service. Even the food was very good but well according to the price, the quantity is a little bit less. It is highly recommended but only I would love some changes that they should provide atlst a couple of benches if nothing along on the waiting area because sitting along the footpath doesn't really look nice.

I moved to Kolkata two years back and during my first week here, one of my friends introduced me to this legendary restaurant. Since then, I have been to Petercat probably a dozen times, taking family and friends visiting us to experience this culinary delight.

The food here is absolutely fantabulous. Be it it's Sizzlers, Kebabs or Curries, every dish in itself is full of unique flavours. Chelo kebab is to die for and the retro drinks menu takes you back in time.

I always crib about the waiting time but keep going back for the food that never fails to amaze.

Right in the heart of Kolkata's Park Street area is the famous Peter Cat. The jury is still out on whether it is highly over-rated or can't be celebrated enough. Seating here is spread over two floors and the lighting and ¬†overall ambiance makes it a nice cool place to nurse a few drinks and relish some chelo kababs. The portion sizes were good and so was the overall dish. ¬†We won't mind going back to sample others dishes.

The ambience at the price is a complete bargain!!
The food I ordered was Chicken Steak Sizzler and Chelo Kebab.

The Sizzler was the best I had till date. It was well blended with the sauces. The veggies were cooked equally good, adding the required tang to the chicken.

In the chelo kebab, you willl find Rice along with butter, an omelette, two seekh kebab and a tikka.
Here the tikka was my favourite, the rice went well with seekh which was quite juicy..but I would have liked it to be a bit more (not a seekh fan :P).

We also ordered a Jaljeera, but maybe a coke would have gone well.

About the price, it's really well balanced.

Peter cat being famous for its sizzlers and chelo kebabs as everyone knows. We also had the classic mutton chelo kebab. It was pretty good. For the starters we had fish makhmali which was awesome and the fish was really soft and melted in the mouth and chicken irani kebab which was so so. Chicken bharta was not bad either.
Over all  3.5 out 5 is what i would give.
But the fish makhmali deserves a 5 on 5.

Like any oter restaurants, Peter Cat is one such. Even during no festive season.. I saw a crowd standing outside.. waiting for the tables to vacate inside and waiting for their chance to dine with their dear ones! Thats the aura of Peter Cat inspite of overloaded customers, the quality of the food doesnt degrade at all.. chiefly try Fish makhmali.. dont go with the name.. its a roasted kinda.. fish balls but terrifically tasty!! Further I had Keema nan, nawabi mutton and chicken bharta. Posting the pics of the food and the ambience as well.. have a look!

Location --very coveninet--in heart of Kolkata, parking might be a bit tricky at some times
Food -- Peter cat is synonymous to Chelo kebab :) the bhetki grills and fish are also quite good, they serve all kinds of drinks and mocktails

Price-- about 1500 for 2 people

This has been one of the most popular restaurants of Kolkata of all time-- I make sure to visit it everytime I am here because of fond memories I have with the place

Peter cat is one of Kolkata's best known restaurants famous for its cello kebab. However over the years their standard has deteriorated. While they always have a full house thanks to the name they've made for themselves, their interior is slightly dirty, with visible dirt on their air conditioners and even the tables. Their service is above average, and the food is still worth it, but definitely has lost it's charm. There are better options available at similar prices for the food they serve.

This place is only known because of the heritage attached to it. The food, ambiance or the service nothing is extraordinary here. Their chelo kebab is the most over hyped food item in Kolkata. Visit this place only if you need a feel of British days and you're a visitor here in Kolkata.

The journey towards salvation for a foodie in Kolkata is incomplete without a visit to Peter Cat. As rightfully listed by many connoisseurs, this place truly lives up to its tag as being a "Legendary" outlet. I am a frequent visitor to this restaurant for one thing and one thing only, the famous Chicken Chello Kebab.

Well, I now have two reasons to visit this place, the second being the Mutton Chello Kebab.

Pros -
i. The chello kebab - wether it is a mutton or chicken variant, one thing you can be sure that the pieces of meats are extremely well cooked and will satisfy all your meat-loving tastebuds.
ii. The ambience - It is as intoxicating as can be. In the dimmed light, nothing to distract you from your food.
iii. The drinks - this thing is sometimes overlooked by people, but the bartenders here literally create magic. Must try the bloody mary and whiskey with pineapple juice.

Cons -
Absolutely none

Verdict -
One of the few places, I can dare to rate a big old 5, without any second thought. My message to all foodies around the globe would be to try the chello kebab atleast once in their lives.

Today at around 5.30 I went there for the third time as my Sister prefers that place the most.

Like before, the food didn't disappoint me.
The staffs are friendly and the interior is ‚ù§

The AC was not working well, but still it was okay.

Today we orders Chelo Kebab which was the best I've tried till date, chicken tandoori was also good, sizzlers - I personally liked it though my sister didn't that much, one Strawberry blossom and a small sized juice ( the strawberry blossom was too surgery, but still okay okay), and as desert we ordered Meringue Biscotti with hot chocolate sauce which was üëå

Many a time I have visited there. Many Visits - hmm that phrase actually gives the snippet of my entire review of this place.

Location: 5min walking distance from the Parkstreet Metro station. Just a building away in the right side of the previous location of the Music World store.

** During the peak hours of lunch and dinner, the ques extends to a huge. So be prepare for that. ** ¬†

#Ambiance : As this restaurant is running from decades here, so ambiance wise once what was unique for them, is now just a regular thing in many restaurants here. That reddish dim lights hanging on every table, which spoils the photographs taken there, small compact sized tables, not much loud, overall a comfortable atmosphere.
¬†
#Food : Price of the food is easy available in their menu snippet available in zomato, so I'm not getting into that part. Though they offer Continental and even north-indian dishes, but I always prefer Continental whenever I visit this place as I think good North-Indian cuisine I can get in many other place, but good continental is rare. I have tried many dishes, though names of all of them is not in mind entirely, still some of them are: Crispy Baby Corn, Irani Kabab, Mutton Seekh Kabab, ¬†Chicken Cutlet, Chelo Kabab, Sizzlers with different items like Chicken Steak, Grilled Fish, etc. They also serve Cocktails & Mocktails, so together everything it becomes a nice experience visiting this place.

Arrived at 7:30 pm, waited for 30 minutes to get a table, understandable. Seated right next to the entrance and creating an obstacle for entering the restaurant. When trying to move the cover to a more convenient side of the table, the manager told us,"the table set-up cannot be changed and if you don't like the table, you can leave the table and wait for another one". Food service was delayed and took another 30 minutes for their most selling item, Chelo kebab. Highly disappointing and disheartening service for the standard expected from this restaurant. In fact, QSRs like KFC and McDonald's have better guest management standards and don't treat their customers with such disrespect. Just because you've hit the big leagues does not mean you treat the people who got you there, like crap.
Please work on getting customer feedback and actually being concerned about your customers and clients. Once again, disappointed.

Coming to food,we ordered the chelo kebab(original), mutton chelo kebab,and tandoor mix sizzler,along with fresh lime soda. Every item was delicious. The kebabs,the sizzler..they were sizzling. Would visit  innumerable number of times.

Mandatory for people visiting Kolkata!!¬†

Life hacks for such 1st timers:

Chapter 1

Dinner/Lunch time?? Go to Park street ‚ñ∂ stand in front of Peter cat - if you are re lucky they won't keep you waiting for long ‚ñ∂ grab a seat ‚ñ∂ take a look at the old school¬†decor with the overhead Tiffany style red lamps ‚ñ∂ Order CHELO Kebab ‚ñ∂ flush em down with some fresh lime soda ‚ñ∂ got room for desserts?? (oh yes you do!!) go for the dessert of the day - they served us orange souffle (given in the pic) loved that smooth citrus flavor!!

The end result ?!¬†

A nicely filled tummy with some Classy Park street swag and the billing: Quite Reasonable!

CHELO KEBAB ~ The traditional dish of Iran > brought by Peter the Cat to Calcutta ‚ñ∂ they fell in love with the City of Joy ‚ñ∂ and made Park Street¬†their second home.

The plate consists of chicken kebabs, herbed rice with some butter cubes melting slow and easy,¬†some veggies by the side,¬†2 skewed mutton kebabs (the way we like),¬† and to top it with a sunny-side-up.¬†

Chapter 2: Biryanis ...Chapter 3: Mishti doi.... Chapter 4: Puchkas, telebhajas & other zesty street food...and so on ...üòâ..... üòú.......

'Seek kebabs, not attention'. I had read this on the internet sometime back. I could totally relate to this statement. This place is famous for kebabs and always remains crowded. You might need to wait for five to ten minutes to get your seat. It's worth the wait, worth the money. The vintage interior and the uniform of the staffs leave that impression of Calcutta. Apart from the bunch of people clicking selfies, the place is perfect if you are a kebab lover.

Having heard so much about Petercat and chelo kebab since childhood, one afternoon my friends and I turned up here for lunch with only one thing in mind- Chelo kebab and chicken steak sizzler.
We ordered the same, and we ate to our heart's content. The buttery rice, the delicious kebab, the perfectly made steak - we had a good lunch. 
The ambiance and decor was soothing and the service hospitable. Overall, the visit was worth all the stories I have grown up hearing and worth the expectation. I'll be back again to try the other dishes they offer.

I went there on a Friday evening with a friend. We got a place easily even after the place being quite crowded. We sat in the smaller room at the back of the restaurant. But I was soon disappointed. The waiters were dressesd in untidy clothes. They were too busy to take our orders. After the orders were taken, it seemed as if a decade will pass before we will be served food. Nevertheless, the Chelo kababs platter was superb. It was exceptional. Not for the ambience, but for the food will I go back to Peter Cat.

Both are old, full of heritage, have long waiting times and also are loved by many for their one particular product(Chelo Kababs‚Äã : Bullet)......But the truth is both are pathetic, service quality sucks big time and both are completely unworthy of the love and affection they receive from their fans.....The humble Chittoda's Cabin serves better food.....Dear Peter Cat you just suck......Thank You......

Ambience: Beautifully unique. The reddish orange lights on each table is pleasing to the eye. The waiters are dressed in a traditional Pathan attire, which adds up to the uniqueness. The outside of the restaurant is a busy street and the broken pavement is not a good place to wait.

Service: We went in the afternoon at around 1 PM. It was not very crowded. We got a seat and were attended immediately and got the food in 20 mins.

Food: Classic and traditional Chello Kebabs, just awesome. The rice could have been a bit more done. Dum ki rann was just awesome. Perfect. We took a butter naan, which was a disaster. It was as fat as a pizza base,  just softer. That is not a naan!! 

Overall: It is a great place for a unique experience and delicious traditonal food.

The most overrated and overhyped restaurant in Park street. We went to this restaurant on Friday night around 9pm. We are given 45 minutes waiting time,usually when restaurants know they get large customers for waiting atleast give a bench to sit the older and young guests, but you do not get anything out here. Just sit along the footpath. This was the first turnoff. After 50 minutes we got the table. We quickly ordered 2 chelo kababs, one sizzler and 4 lemon soda. The lemon soda came quickly but sizzler took its own time around 20 minutes to come to the table. I also saw guests with alcoholic drinks were attended more frequently then the non alcoholic tables. We asked for the chelo's quickly but it also took another 10 mins. The chicken kabab were just tasteless and Tikka ones were cold inside, truly showing that the it came just from cold storage. The rice was just plain rice dipped with butter. The veg chelo contains were same as veg sizzler which was really surprising to have same items again and the waiter didn't inform us. To cut short, really long wait, over expensive food and really sad service. You can skip this restaurant from your list next time you visit Park street.

I came to know from Zomato that this is the only place in Kolkata which can serve a very different dish "Chelo Kababs". The ambiance is dark there and small lamps are mounted on your table which gives a unique feeling and the staff here wears the traditional attire which gives you a heritage kind of feeling about this place. 
Well, we don't have any reservations here but still the restaurant manager was so kind that he allowed us to sit and got the taste of their famous Chelo Kababs. 
Regarding the food, they take some time to prepare your dish when you order it but when it comes on your table it's a worth of waiting to enjoy this dish. 
Well, this dish have mutton seekh kababs, chicken tikkas tossed with some secret spices and sauces, complimented with steamed rice, salad and a portion of butter. 
Believe me, I have never tried such a tasty dish in my life. I couldn't figure out that which thing gives that dish a unique taste in my plate. Everything was perfect there, service was good as well. 
The most interesting part is if you visit late there then may be you will have to wait for 15-20 mins there. So, in my opinion best time to visit there is between 6.30-7.30 pm when you will get the space very easily there due to less crowd at this time.

Full marks for the super popular Chelo Kabab served here! It's sheer indulgence. Difficult to get seats during lunch and dinner time but we managed to get in at lunch time. Place is not very spacious so staff needs to be very careful while moving around and serving we almost avoided a full tray falling on us. 
A must visit at Kolkata.

I'm giving them 1 out of 5, just because zomato doesn't allow me to rate below 1. Now, the experience l have had here was unique in every aspect. Staffs looked at us very weirdly as we were clad in khadi. Perhaps, that's not a fine choice to enter such an elite restaurant. Servicemen did not bother to serve and just gave no heed to the fact that I wanted the dirty plate to be replaced. Chelo Kabab was something very usual, Biriyani was horrible. The rice used for preparing these dishes was of very poor quality. Finally, when I was going to leave the place after paying the amounts, a serviceman snatched the bill out of my hand (yes, he did) and shouted to his co-employees, "Bhai, e to 2 taka tips diyeche re" (Bro, this fool has given us a tips of just 2 rupees.)
If you're pretty rich but don't have any sense of food, this is a place you can go ahead for.

Finally dream come true for me . At last I could manage to visit this restaurant which all of my friends have always recommended me . Luckily I didn't have to stand in a queue . Entering inside , its a dim colored light inside . Waiters wearing suits and the other those who were serving foods wore an Afghan outfit adding Afghan flavor to the environment itself .Ordered Fruit cup at first , a mixed juice containing few slices of fruits also , then came the starters . I love fish so in starters we had Fish Makhmali and Fish Farah both of them are delicious and are made of Bhetki ,So soft It almost melted once we took a bite . ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Yes !!! I did eat that also . How can one resist Chelo Kabab once you visit this place . It was awesome . Thanks to Peter cat for introducing us to this Afghan delicacy . Sizzlers were also not far left behind in demand we could see waiters serving hot sizzlers to most of the tables . We couldn't resist the temptation and finally ordered chicken Sizzlers with soft drinks at the end .

Overall It is a nice experience . Good ambience and good food which will make me come again to this place .

I have visited this place many times.... People mostly talk about its popular dish namely Chelo Kabab which is definitely awesome to taste. I too tried Chelo Kabab on my first visit. It is really very delicious. But Peter Cat has many more delicacies which are worth trying.... Their sizzlers are also equally popular. I have tried their house special sizzler and it was simply yummmm. Besides other dishes worth giving a try  are Farah (a fish kabab),nalli gosht,chicken irani kebab and afghani chicken. I have tried these dishes during my different visits and they all are excellent. However in deserts I have tried their caramel pudding which I found to be just average. But overall it is definitely a place to go time and again...!!

Had been there many a times since last 12 years. Visited today again. The taste of their seezlers are exactly the same as it was earlier. The chelo kebabs are also the excellent. My wife's favorite drink Amazonea is also excellent. The only bad thing here is the long queue. They should arrange for a place to wait for the people waiting outside or they should increase space to accommodate more people.

Vintage feel when you enter this restaurant & you know that this place is here from a long time serving people of Kolkata with their tasty food. Went there on my birthday and ofcourse ordered their signature dishes.. Chelo kebab and Chicken grilled sizzler and fresh lime sodas. Very good service and management. Hope to visit again and try their " chef's special".

When it comes to legendary restaurants in kolkata, nothing beats the mighty peter cat.. known for its sizzlers and chelo kebab this restaurant is a star attraction.. a heart throb of foodies.. 
The ambience is perfect.. the interior is soothing..
Have been going there for years now..went there yesterday too.. had fish makhmali and chelo kebab.. while fish makhmali hasnt failed to disappoint the tastebuds, the only discontentment is the fact that the taste of chelo kebab has detoriated over the years now.. i wanna have the taste of the chelo kebab i used to get 5 or 6 years back..

And my exploring food spree continues. This time Peter Cat. Heard a lot about this place and it has quite a good waiting time.
Ambiance is really good and I liked the beer mugs.
Ordered fish fingers which was pretty ordinary. And then the famous Chelo Kabab. It was pretty good with seekh kabab portion being the full of tastes part. Quite filling and subtle taste, not hard on your palate. Overall a good experience and might go there again to try their chicken steak sizzlers

The name itself is enough! Great food... One of the legacy restaurants in the city! Peter Cat and Chello kebabs! (sacred stuff!)  
But, breaking the stereotypes... Do try the steak sizzlers with bread rolls! Its probably the best you will find in the city!

the famous CHELO KABAB of Kolkata ¬†is here. the very first thing to be tried is this. no matter in what season you go whether festive or not you have to wait in long queues irrespective of the time. the food is delicious. but its worth it. if you wanna try something else apart from Chelo Kabab then Sizzlers are the very next options. the sound of the sizzlers when they bring them in is something that soothes your ears, and after eating it soothes you tummy...¬†
go on if you have still not visited this place.

BAD ... 
I am giving this review because of what we experienced. May be it is good. It is one of the best in kolkata but we went there on Saptami 2016. We were in a que of about 2 hours.. and after that they gave us a horrible table..the table was placed in a very bad place..it was the extention part. the bulbs were cut..we ate almost in dark..and the food was really bad. We had chello kabab & sizzler but both were horrible..the service was also so bad.it was just waste of money.

Been to Peter Cat only 4 times. But the experience is really enriching everytime you go. During the last visit this sunday we had our usual menu.. started with lime soda and chef's recommended kabab platter. Had chelo kabab, grilled chicken sizzler and harems joy for main course. Ended with tutty fruity ice cream. Everything was too good and hence full marks.

My most favourite restaurant.I have been here for many times. The place is always crowded but still it's a perfect place for hanging out with your friends/celebrating your special days/a cosy chit chat with your loved ones.Peter cat is mostly famous for its mouth watering chello kebab.its just awesome in taste.I have tried almost all the dishes in Peter Cat n all the dishes are really good.The Fish makhmali kebab is too good.Fishes are fresh & it's melted in mouth.Chicken Irani kebab is my another favorite item.Its soft & tasty. But I must say those who are visiting the restaurant for the first time should must try the chello kebab because it defines the Identity of Peter Cat.

What come in your mind when you think of Peter Cat ??¬†
Prawn Cocktail, Mix Grill Sizzlers, Chelo Kebab and Brownie with Hot Fudge Sauce - That's the Meal to order when you visit Peter Cat.

And they nail it each time. Same great taste, melt in you mouth pieces of succulent meat, the best quality of Fish, Prawn and Meat.

A Kolkatan's love for Peter Cat have remained unchanged over the decades. That's why at any point of time, on any day, you will find a queue at the entrance and a Captain courteously takes down your name & number and assigns you a waiting time. All I can say is that the food is always worth the wait.

The most famous Chelo Kebab Restaurant in Kolkata. This place has long queues always no matter what! People are always willing to wait just to grab a plate of chelo kebab. But I feel this place is so much more than just Chelo Kebab. They have an extensive Indian and Continental menu. On my first visit I had the Tandoori Prawns, Biryani-ala-Kashmiri and the original Chelo kebab. Though it serves authentic Chelo Kebab, I enjoyed the other dishes much more! 
On my subsequent visits, I have had their Fish Makhmali and their various Sizzlers. The fish makhmali is just melting in the mouth and they use fish which is very fresh and of good quality. The Tandoor Mixed Grilled sizzler has various meat mixes-chicken, mutton, prawns, fish, paneer and egg- with an indian based gravy. The House Special sizzler is full of chicken livers and has chicken breasts and sausages too! 
I have also had their baked chicken, which is delicious! 
Its my earnest request to please try dishes other than just Chelo Kebab! Trust me, you will love it even more!

Park Street and its amazing restaurants make each visit a memorable one. And, when it comes to Peter Cat, it's more of a nostalgia for most of the Kolkatans. It is one such restaurant in Kolkata that we recommend to every visitor who loves food. Be it midday or dinnertime, you better expect a queue outside the restaurant. Their d√©cor, cordial waiters and sumptuous food hardly fail to impress you every time you visit them. Their stewards are so courteous and nice that when I burnt my finger in the hot stone placed below the fish platter, they readily brought a glass of water to dip my burnt finger in it. Their special dish Chelo Kebab is a must try. Guys, their Grilled Fish will simply sweep you off your feet if you love having fish just as I do. Do try it! The Chicken Steak Sizzler is also yummy. But too many pieces of potato in this dish might disappoint you a bit! Overall, a big thumbs up to Peter Cat! Cheers to life! Cheers to food!
Pocket pinch: Around Rs. 1300

Had visited this place on a Friday evening who had come to Kolkata for the 1st time. Considering I had heard so much about chelo kabab, I decided to treat him with the same. For extremely disappointed with the good quality. The food was not hot and was very bland. The entire dish was so dry that it was difficult to swallow. We were standing in the que for so long that we were really hungry and didn't have the patience to argue over food. Would not recommend to anybody.

The wait was finally over when me and my friend checked this place off from our bucket list.

Date of Visit : 8.04.2017

Food : Chelo Kababs (The Original), House Special (sizzler) and Fresh Lime Sodas 
The food was heavenly and filling. The kebabs were succulent and tasty. The rice felt a bit flat. The sizzler was amazing. The steak tasted great. It was too much for just the two of us but we could successfully complete it! Do not forget to finish off the lunch with the lime sodas. :)

Ambience : The ambience is great with dim lighting.

Service : The staff was courteous and attentive to our needs.

Overall, it was a great experience and the place was buzzing since it was a Saturday. It was a perfect Saturday lunch. However, we had to wait for around 30 mins before getting a table. The only turn off was our neighbours in the opposite booth!

This has been my favourite place since my childhood!! I have always loved their food and have had some superb memories here!! However, I guess people become business minded and they lose the essence of customer service!! Today being Poila Boishakh we wanted to come here to enjoy our dinner as a family and I so wanted to relive my childhood memories all the more because I don't stay in Kolkata these days!! It's been more than 10 minutes that we have been sitting here (DO READ THAT WE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR 2 HOURS BEFORE WE GOT A TABLE - SUCH WAS THE QUEUE) however, firstly they didn't clean the used glasses from the table and we had to ask them to do so and then they also didn't serve us water till we asked for it!!! I understand it's a busy day but losing the essence of being pf of Bengal's most authentic restaurant has made me make a choice and take a decision of never coming back here ever again!! Very complacent and not interested attitude as well!!!

Peter Cat is one of the oldest restaurant establishments in Kolkata and has probably been there for decades. It is a two floor, Iranian, Inter-Continental restaurant known for their ‚ÄòChelo Kebab‚Äô and sizzlers. I went there around 3:00 pm on a weekday and had a waiting, which was very usual for anyone coming to Peter Cat. The first thing which I ordered was a plate of Chicken Irani kebab along with a mug of beer which was an extreme necessity considering the weather. The kebab pieces were juicy, tender and soft, a sign of perfectly cooked kebab. Followed it was the famous ‚ÄòChelo Kebab‚Äô, a dish serving sheik and reshmi kebabs cooked in rare spices blended with Persian herbs and served on a bed of rice with butter and egg. After that, I ordered for the Chicken Sizzler which is one of my favorite dishes there since the first time I visited when I was small. I also had prawn cocktail, prawns dipped in a sweet, tangy and spicy sauce. The interior is still the same as it has been since I went there for the first time, a mildly lit place with big lamp shades over each table. The staff was dressed like those that of the pre-independence period and are as courteous as ever. Overall I had a great experience, the one which I had longed for since ages.I must say they have maintained the quality of the place and the food.

There's a saying that "First impressions last. You start behind the eight ball, you're never gonna get in front." Well, Peter Cat took it way too seriously. If I had to pick the best restaurant in Park Street from an overall point of view, I'd pick this one. Again and again. Everything about this place is so perfect. The staff, the professionalism, the hospitality, the food, the quality, the service time, the privacy, the ambience. I have recommended this place to many of my friends and family and it's an unanimous decision that Peter Cat is perfect. So, stop wasting your time and dine in  this place, if you haven't already.

Well, located just next to au-bon-pain is peter cat the famous park street eatery, well known for its chelo kebabs.
This place is almost fully reserved on weekends,so make sure you have made your bookings before you turn up, otherwise u might have to wait before u get a table
As u enter the place u find it very dimly lit. The seating is quite comfortable with chinese lanterns hanging above each table..the waiters are dressed in the traditional colonial attire which the indian waiters wore when they served the british.(Though this place isnt that old,it started catering customers from 1970 and the name peter cat comes from the famous chesire cat that lives at lords stadium in england)
We ordered for:-

1. Chelo kebabs- this is the speciality of peter cat the signature dish which has been attracting generations of foodies from different parts of the country.
Served with buttered rice,2portions of mutton seekh kebab,1 poached egg and barbqued chicken nd vegetables.
The rice is very aromatic nd the kebabs are beautifully. This will definitely make u visit this place again and again

2. Mixed tandoori grill- This is a tandoori sizzler platter topped with thick  gravy this is" passionately recommended" in the menu.
By golly!! This beauty tastes awesome the grilled chicken,pranwn,paneer,liver and muttom seekh are tenderly grilled and the gravy is very tangy nd lip smackingly delicious.
The only thing that irked me here was the very non- chalant and rude behaviour of the staff, they are not even considerate about the customers problems.

All in all,for the foodies out there chelo kebab is a MUST try and do try the tandoori mixed grill my personal suggestion :-p

Peter cat is d nostalgia that I like to cherish every time I visit Park Street.dim lights, retro anterior, waiters in mughlai attire and d atmosphere‚Äã takes me to a trip to d British -anglo Indian colonial era Everytime I visit d place.
Today I visited it as well with my fellow foodie Madhurima Nandy .After 20 min of waiting we finally entered d restaurant .It was 2.45 pm.so without beating d bush , we went straight for 2 plates of d mutton chello kebebs , one beer and one vodka+pineapple cocktail (Chinese itch).The drinks were served first with munchies. D cocktail was finely mixed and it offered a nice kick .Then d show stopper was served. D fragrant rice with 3 cubes of butter, poached egg, grilled tomatoes ,a slice of cucumber ,2 pieces of mutton seekh kebabs and grilled chicken kebab with capsicum and tomatoes....That's chello kebeb.its d Iranian poetry that's cooked in d kitchen of Peter cat.its something that u can't describe in words.its something that u must taste and devour.

We had the infamous cheelo kebab and chicken Irani kebab.
What a fantastic meal indeed. The meat was cooked to perfection and to h in flavour.
The portions are very generous and two of were full in this amount. 
The ambiance is very nice and staff is dressed in a traditional attire, giving the whole dining experience a royal touch.
I truly enjoyed the meal and it's authenticity.

Went there for lunch on a sunday afternoon as the place is very old and famous. Ordered the famous chelo kabab - veg and veg grilled sizzler. Food was good only complaint is about repetition of kababs in both the dishes. Sizzler basically was stuffed vegetables like capsicum, potato, tomato where stuffing was repetitive either aloo or paneer.
But food was good in taste.

Pros - Since I am staying out of Kolkata off recently for job, this one place is a must go spot whenever I visit Kolkata. Love unconditionally your Chello Kabab and Sizzlers. Those are ur signature dishes. Loved screw driver as well. It's also good to see so many managers and attendants..

Cons- Ironically despite having this much manpower the service is slow, have had to repeat a lot of times even for a glass of water, off lately Chello Kababs which are served after 15-20min they are cold, not everyone is friendly and helpful( I can cite an example ), and except the signature dishes,other food items say chilly chicken which I tried recently is not Peter Cat standard. 

Please take care of the issues. Because I love being at your place.

The most traditional chineese cuisine restruant in the city of joy running for generations after the other. The restru has a single outlet at heart of the city which is always overflowing with guests waiting in long queue outside. People who crave for othentic dishes can pay a visit here. Chelo kebab n sizzlers are special recomendations. The interiour is not the themed one ofcourse but darkness and the gloomy lights make the ambience no less. I hope if there would be little much power lights to avoid accidental floor slipings.

Coming to the menu...we ordered the...Cat's House Special Sizzlers and Chelo Kabab..along with Fresh Lime Soda..both the main course dishes were Excellently made ..perfectly cooked..üëåabsolutely delicious.

The service and ambience were both satisfactory..

Worst food ever had in Kokata. Too expensive and packaging was not even proper. Malai kofta was full of oil. Burger seems to be a normal road side snack. Fries were not even evenly cut, too cold due to bad packaging.

One of the oldest fine dining restaurant in kolkata, located in the heart of the city, Park street. I have been to this place many times and everytime its a fab experience. Peter cat is synonyms to chello kebeb and it is a must have if you go there. A wholesome meal itself. And yes they do not compromise with either the quality or quantity. Sizzlers are a good options too. Coming to the decor, it has the old world charm with dim lights low lights. The staffs are courteous ¬†and they don't leave anyone unattended as far as my experience goes. Though the price is on a higher side, its worth it.

Not much to say....if you are in Kolkata, Peter Cat is a must. It is one of the oldest and finest dining out in Kolkata. Chelo kababs and their sizzlers are out of this world and probably because of which they are always crowded. Weekends are not a good option to go and if so reservations are highly recommended.

Their decor is pretty different from what I have seen at other places. Their cutlery used for serving drinks is also unique which grabs your attention and you feel different. Their chelo kebab both vegetarian and non vegetarian are delicious and it's quite fulfilling as they are served alongwith the rice. Their indian food is also tasty. It's a little expensive but worth a try in Kolkata.

Authentic & one and only chello kebabs in town.

Flavour is very mild, with undertone of butter.

Chello kebab is a kind of platter which includes 'melt in mouth' mutton and chicken, rice topped with butter.

It's one of its kind and tastes awesome. Reservation is recommended as this place is always crowded.

Aboywithafork says it's a must have.

Thank you petercat for such an amazing delight :)

The once upon a time Peter Cat is no longer the same. Starting with the behaviour of the staffs, the senior managers were utter horrible.Since it is one of the oldest restaurant at park street it seems to enjoy a superficial benefit as we all know we have to wait for atleast half an hour to get a table. But the food quality@ has degraded a lot. They limit the menu. The food when served on the table is almost cold. They will not provide you with any extra chair to place our belongings even if the restaurant is empty. Overall horrible experience.There are far better restaurants in the same area and the staffs are way more courteous.

Fantastic place. Just fantastic. We went there for dinner at 10 and waited till 10 45. Because of its huge queue. Coming down to food, we had chelo kabab because of limited menu, because it was closing down. And was good chelo Kabab was good not so great so as to speak. next we had chicken tikka sizzler and it was ok I guess it had huge chunks of chicken which I only ate my friend didn't because she was terrified of them. The only let down of Peter cat is there sitting arrangement they should have  gotten more seats and expanded owing to its reputation. So all in all a great restaurant. 4 from me.

Though it's more of a Non-veg restaurant!¬†

I being a vegetarian do visit this place for 2 patent dishes.¬†

One is the Chelo kebab's and the other being the sizzlers.

¬†Did'nt find any other better place for this.

Thanks Peter Cat for maintaining the Quality. I visit here since my childhood and its still the same.

Happy Me :D

Got to know what make people wait hours after hours to get inside this cozy restaurant. Being one of the heritage restaurant of Calcutta over decades with a very sophisticated ambiance, Peter Cat grew it's popularity. 

The signature dish, Chelo Kebab was obvious choice with Grilled Fish in sizzler. Beckty Muniere watered our mouth more at the end <3

With almost every review on the higher side, I would say there are a lot of places in the city offering better food than them. 
They have earned a huge brand name with loyalty and trust and that is why you will always find a queue outside this 'one of the oldest restaurants' in the heart of the city. 
It is visited by people irrespective of their ages and it has something to offer everyone. 
With great name comes great desserts and peter cat has been successful by offering great sizzlers.

If in Peter cat, surely try their chello kebab, there have been many replicas to it but replicas never match up to the original.
Food is luscious, ambience is Gothic in style, not for dim witted startans, staffs are good and friendly. This restaurant boasts of a great combination of grub and drinks, a little heavy on pocket yet worth every penny. If experimental is your attitude, you can surely try Peter cat.

Loved every prawn dish we tried there and the people out there were very helpful with the selections. Anyhow it was our prawn craving day so we ate just that. As usual I love the place and have been here every now and then when I visit Kolkata, would suggest anyone visiting Park Street for the first do give it a try and be ready to wait a while.

Well this place has literally become synonymous with the Chelo Kabab... So much so that you invariably tend to skip the menu and overlook the vast array of dishes on offer... This place serves great sizzlers too, but frankly, not too many people care... You go to Park Street, make your way to Peter Cat, stand in a queue for some time, go in and order Chelo Kabab... It has really become sort of robotic and even after so many days, you can swear by their Chelo Kabab... It is still the best in the business... Best avoided on weekends and during festivals, since the waiting time just keeps shooting up... Go in late on quieter weekdays, or non-festival weekends, and eat to your heart's delight...

This is a wonderful place with a wonderful ambience. The only catch is that there is a tremendous waiting time. 
The sizzlers and chelo kebab are their signature dishes and are so for a reason. Do not miss out on them.

Likes: the ambience, the staff, the good food, the quality, the taste, the price is pretty affordable too.

The love of the people of the City of Joy is undying with Park Street and its string of restaurants. From Flurys to Barbeque Nation to Mocambo to Tung Fong, this place has been always one of the favourites of foodies from the city. And when we talk about food at Park Street we just cannot miss out on probably the most popular one here, Peter Cat.
Peter Cat is a place that oozes class and quality. One of the oldest restaurants here, Peter Cat has a romantic corner in Kolkatan hearts for a very long time. It‚Äôs really hard to come by a person who loves food and hasn't been to Peter Cat in this city. From ambience to decor to food and staff it‚Äôs definitely one of those places for fine dining that is always in vogue. We bring here a detailed review of their two most famous dishes.
Chelo Kabab:
The Chelo Kabab is something that has its name going hand in hand with Peter Cat. A mixed platter of chicken and mutton kebabs along with butter rice and little bit of seasoned veggies makes a beautiful delicious plate of food. On one side you have a couple of mutton seekh kababs, soft and tender, prepared to perfection.
On the other side you have chicken kababs along with grilled onions and tomatoes. In the middle you have the rice with a generous topping of butter and poached egg on top. It‚Äôs served with two pieces of bread(on order).This dish is simply perfection on a plate.
House Special Sizzler:
Two large portions of juicy steaks accompanied by two smoked sausages with a beautiful poached  egg, sunny side up on top. It‚Äôs a served on a bed of grilled lettuce and covered with a savoury sauce on top along with grilled veggies on the side. One of the high points of this dish is you will find a small piece of grilled liver in it and surprisingly that appeals to non-liver lovers too.
Peter Cat is a place you should definitely try out if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs one of the places that you will want to come back again and again.
Price for two: Rs700 - Rs1000 (without alcohol)

Food was good. Staff is friendly, however waiting for a friend in such a busy restaurant was a bit uncomfortable. This is really busy and always has a queue standing. 
One major drawback was the unclean untidy uniform of the whole staff. Being such a famous restaurant. Holding a legacy of so many years, this came as a surprise. The staff was nice no doubt. But the men serving (practically most of them) had unclean uniforms.

Very famous restaurant in Kolkata. We visited to have the Chelo Kebab. Ordered for One Chelo Kebab and one chicken sizzler. 

The Chelo Kebab was good. A different concept that I tried. With 2 kinds of Kebabs served with rice and egg. The sizzler was different from the usual ones I've had. This had potato fries, the chicken in it was covered with a batter and the veggies were as usual. 

 Both dishes were topped with one whole egg. Egg is like aloo, it is served with everything. ;)

Today it is proven that parkstreet restaurants have lost their charm. Was realy looking forward for chelokabab. Highly dissapointed with the dish. Oily sausages, the quantity of rice has been reduced considerably. The kebabs tasted like dead meat only. No spices. Coming over to service. The attendents are highly unprofessional. Whatever you say they give a cold shoulder. Despite of having the 4 seaters empty they didnt allow us to move there and gave us a three seater at the cornor which was realy unconfortable. Higly dissapointed.

Visited with my family today we ordered the Dum Ki Raan, chicken steak , mutton Chelo Kebab and chicken cold salad. Special mention for Dum Ki Raan which was excellent, first time i tried something other than Chelo kebabs, and it left me wanting for more! Don't miss this.

I along with my friends visited here last Saturday for lunch. I have tried chello kebab here before. So I wanted to try another food. So we ordered Biryani Ala Nawabi, Biryani Ala Kashmiri and Mixed Raita. As usually I prefer raita with biryani so I ordered. And the taste of biryani was excellent. Especially the aroma of the Aloo was great. Very good experience was that. Surely I will visit here again and again.

After hearing a lot about this heritage restaurant , one fine Saturday I went to explore it.Half waiting in a queue for half an hour we finally got a table.I would suggest a prior table booking for all 1st time visitor even in a not eventful day.The interior & decor failed to impress me.The lamp shades were dirty.We ordered their signature dish "Chelo Kebab". Though the service was prompt but the platter was cold.The kebabs were dry and bland, the rice was cold.Overall I don't think the place is making little effort to live upto its reputation

Chelo Kebab of Peter Cat literally offsets the space crunch and all other cons it has. One should visit Peter Cat solely for good food. Ambience is nice but the place is always overcrowded which is really annoying.

It was a nice place. The food was good. We ordered roast chicken under meat and poultry, but they got us roast chicken sizzler. They should have clarified it. The service was good. Chelo kebabs are a must.

This is a fine place to have a meal with friends and family. The food was fine but the service was slow and the waiters were more busy with talking with each other than actually waiting tables. Ordered the Chelo Kabab, which is one of their signature dishes, which was fine. The ambiance was also nice. Better service by the waiting staff is required.

We went here for Sunday lunching - just to check all the popularity surrounding this place around the corner. 
We ordered from their recommended menu option on zomato :
Prawns cocktail (which tasted like a bit too much ketchup for some reason) 
Chello kebab (which seemed very basic) 

We went away from the standards and ordered shah nauz - and that was pretty brilliant. 

The place has a different charm to it. All the red lights, the theme based dressing and good service gets them the added brownie points. 

One of the must visits in kolkata.

Went there on the day of Saraswati Puja. The ambience is soothing and refreshing here and the low lights add a different charm to it. Peter Cat, famous for decades and ca@rrying the tag of luxurious dinner/lunch at moderate pocket pinch rightfully deserves it. Service was great. We were given a 7 seater round table. The guy who was serving the food was well mannered and well trained I must say. Food here is awesome. They certainly serve one of the best Chhelo Kebab in Kolkata. Overall it was a great experience starting from the greetings to exiting the place.

It's my third visit and unfortunately the quality is declining. The passionately recommended mixed tandoori sizzler is worst of them all. And it doesn't even taste good. Waste of money. Different drinks are hardly available from the menu. If you want to treat yourself, stay with the basics. Otherwise the experience will be pathetic. Highly disappointed.

This is one of the most famous restaurants in Kolkata, and one step inside it, will tell you why. The ambience is perfect and the staff is very courteous and friendly. 
The food is just about cooked very well as we had a Veg Sizzler platter and a Chicken Steak Sizzler (I had ordered a normal steak and was served the Sizzler, the waiter didn't ask and therefore half a star deducted). 
The portions are good. I also had a cocktail, whose name I don't remember now, but it was rum based and had the right mix. 
Must be visited more than once to enjoy their range.

Peter Cat... a pioneer in modernizing the Calcuttan Palate, and reforming the taste of Bengalis, when it comes to luxury dining!
Now, keeping aside the hype and frenzy that has built up over the past 4 decades, I honestly felt they are good in what they do, but certainly not the best.
I tried some Continental as well as North-Indian here.
‚óΩBekti Muniere (2 soft large fillets in cheese, great to start with)
‚óΩGrilled Chicken Sizzler (2 small legs, potatoes were unneccesary)
‚óº Makkhan Naan
‚óº Nalli Gosht (this mutton preparation was on the saltier side)
The dessert was great,
‚ñ™ Tutti Fruiti
‚ñ™ Caramel Creme
On the whole, the items were good, but over-priced, judging by the quantity. Waiters were very cordial and attentive. Interiors were great, with a staircase leading to a bar. May visit again to try something else.

Not sure whats the hype about....May be quality North Indian food in Kolkata....Yes food taste was good but nothing exceptional worth of hype.....Had to ask for water after being seated which is usually served without asking at any high-end restaurant. Surprisingly restaurant didn't have room temperature regular water but had bottled water at room temperature. Though service was quick, it felt like a push to finish early so next waiting guest is seated. Ambiance is really good. Make sure to reach well before you are hungry as Waiting can be up to 40 mins.

Note: This is my personal opinion based on 1 visit.

Came to Peter cat for my wife's birthday celebration. We were having lunch and at the end, the birthday cake was cut. We didn't knew that birthday celebration is not allowed here. She cut the cake, every staff also observed. 
When I requested for some plates, the waiter said, birthday cake is not allowed here, pls pack the cake. Another manager came and told us harshly to pack the cake. We said, as the cake is already cut, it is a  etiquette to have the bite. But they forced to pack it. 
This kind of behaviour is not at all expected from a top named restaurant like Peter cat. The whole mood was spoiled. Kolkata is famous for serving and good cultured restaurant, this place is a black spot on the Name and culture.

PS: We had to wait for 2 hour long queue to have a 7 seat family lunch. I will not recommend anyone for this place.

One very impressive thing is that, in this restaurant you will find e great combination of Indian, Mughlai and continental food with a great quality.
But you have to keep time in hand. Please do not expect a very fast service here. After placing your order, you will have to wait at least 15-20 minutes...!

Visited this place today 8th'March2017 ordered the famous chelo kebabs.The chelo kebab that we got served was a damp squib tasteless, overcooked and dry.I have tasted much better chelo kebab here in Kolkata itself.The poached egg was no where how it's made the yoke was overcooked.The mutton seekh kebab was the saving grace though.Next we ordered "Dum ki Raan" the manager suggested bread with it.Dum ki Raan was cold,soury and the meat was not cooked properly and very chewy.
Next coming to service the staff didnt serve anything and were more busy among themselves discussing about their "life,playing football and going to babughat etc. all really loud" and the manager seemed to have a foolish grin upon enquiry from a family at the nearby table.
All in all a very bad experience and overhyped place just a waste of money.

This is one of the ol' good places in Kolkata.Park Street and Peter Cat go hand in hand. A nostalgic charm that is associated with this ristorante, engulf you on your visit to the place.

The waiters are humble and always ready to lend a helping hand.

¬†I ordered one of the most iconic dishes of this iconic place i.e Chelo kebab.Oh boy! Now I get what's the hullabaloo about it.This is pure heaven.

Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler is another gold mine.¬†
The other things we ordered are Pulao and Mutton Rogan Josh. Both the dishes were okay.

Last came Vanilla Ice Cream with Brownie and Hot Chocolate Sauce which I would prefer to call 'Nectar'.
For that dessert, ¬†Peter Cat earns some brownie points from me.

This place is so crowded which makes it look like the best restaurant in the city. But according to me it's not as a best restaurant doesn't mean the one with best food but also service, ambience and everything. This restaurant has the worst service I have ever received in a so popular restaurant. Not only this, the person who took our order was also very rude and did not had proper etiquettes to attend a customer. The waiter was ill-mannered too. The napkin provided was also torn and the surrounding near the table was also not good. Check the pics attached here. Although the food was very good but don't order the vegetarian main course as it sucks.

Service - 0/5

Very easy to locate this restaurant near Park Street metro station. After hearing all the praises we visited this legendary restaurant recently. The ambience was really nice and cozy with the dim lights. The staffs were good but not very courteous. We ordered Mutton Chelo Kebab - which was very delicious, the mutton kebabs and sausages were really tender and tasty and so was the buttered rice. Chicken Steak Sizzler - the best chicken I ever had!!! Two big chicken breasts were served with a poached egg on the bed of veggies. Chicken were perfectly cooked, nice, juicy and delicious. Roast Chicken - another good dish but not great. For desert we ordered Caramel Casturd which was okayish.... Overall a nice experience and wanna go there again for the mouth watering Sizzler.....

Well known for its signature dish,Chelo kebab. Peter cat is one of the best choice you'd make while searching for a place in parkstreet with both good food and ambience. The chicken sizzler has now become my personal favorite here. The waiting line for a table might be pretty long at times, as there's always a decent rush in this restaurant.

Below average quality of continental food. Chicken Steak Sizzler was simply tossed in black sauce, and grilled fish was not properly cooked. The worst part was the fish fingers, which tasted more like boiled fish fried with gram flour. The mayonnaise along with it was equally horrible. Overall 1500 bucks wasted in a below average meal, the restaurant is only surviving in it's previously earned reputation.

Peter Cat - one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata.. and truly it does live up to it's reputation till date. Been here like a thousand times and the place still remains the same. The food is still so tasty. 

A must have here is the very famous Chelo Kebab.. but off late I noticed that their Reshmi kebab is very dry. It‚Äôs not as succulent as it used to be. 

The sizzlers are cooked to perfection.. a new favourite of mine on the menu would be chicken Reshmi butter masala with butter naan. Not only was the chicken  soft and delicious but the naan was no less. Ans no meal is ever complete without the pickled onion kept on the table. 

The staff is friendly and polite. And the service is great. On any given day would love to go back here without a second thought even though we know that there is a mandatory 30mins of waiting outside the restaurant which at the end of the meal seems so worth it.

My friend and I we came out full.. all smiles and happy stomach. :)

Reached Peter cat at the perfect time of 7.30 ,when the queue starts to build up on a Saturday evening. It was a friendly birthday threat by a close friend.
It was my first visit but was memorable owing to a few things mentioned below.
The restaurant is old and has low lighting,maybe to hide the drawbacks...Just kidding.
It was full,we were given a 7 seater round table and was greeted very nicely.
The waiters were polite and suggested wisely.
The servers were dressed like Mughals severs with the trational dress and hat.
As usual ,our order included the patent chello kabab, chicken grilled sizzler.
Starters included golden prawn ,and a cold chicken salad.
We even managed to have a ham grilled sizzler.
The sizzler was not that overwhelming but so so, rather the chello rice was too tasty.
Kababs served with rice and a small piece of butter and a egg poach.Just amazing

Cons:
We were not allowed to cut the birthday cake as outside food is not allowed.
They have a great rule of placing sizzlers or chello kabab on a paper which had a note on the item,then when you take your presentation so seriously,please serve better glasses.

I had to leave early but I would not rate it too high but a nice place to spend your evening.Badhan Podder Samapan Paul

Heritage restaurant of Park Street for over decades. May it be a weekday or weekend, queue is a must. The popularity stays behind the taste n flavour of the food. The waiters dressed as serve men of the Maharaja gharana...the ambience is very sophisticated. This place is known for the sizzling sizzlers they serve. Of the variety menu we had the following:

#House special sizzler- the smoky hot plate was served with fresh beans n carrots boiled, two chicken sausages, mutton liver n two heavy chicken breast pieces fluffied in egg n then all tossed in an exotic unique brown sauce which is sweetish. Just excellent!

#Fish makhmali kebab- smoked fish which justifies its name "makhmali" is creamy n very soft with the flavour of different herbs. Nice texture n too good!

#Chellokebab- the signature dish of this place. On the plate they serve buttered rice with meat kakori kebabs n a whole chicken roasted kebab with a poached egg n tomato on top. Another mouth-watering speciality! 

Overall, a must visit place of Kolkata which still keeps the standard of food the same as it was decades before.

Today was last day of duty travel and was supposed to move to delhi, from Kolkata. Decided to go to Peter Cat for lunch, with whole team and ordered Chemo Kebab, it's the best Keebab I have had so far, the keebabs were soft and succelent, not overtly spicy, the accompanying rice was cooked to perfection, with generous amount of butter. It was worth the visit, and shall be coming back soon for more, highly recommended.
PS- The ambience and service was also great.. the drinks menu was hilarious, will be trying next time

Peter Cat has always been there in my bucket list since the foodie in me had awakened. One of  Kolkata's legendary resturant this place is located nowhere but Park Street itself.
Getting a table can be a bit tiring as this place is croweded almost everyday  but if your lucky stars are on your side you will easily manage to get one.
The chelo kebab is real good but a tad bit hyped. The Sizzlers are of equal grandeur as cited by everyone.
The serive is good and quick and they never make you wait too long and refrain you from having THE PETER CAT EXPERIENCE.

As any Bengali whose roots lie in Kolkata, I have a long standing loyalty towards Peter Cat, as do they with their failproof quality in food. Went there after a long time yesterday for my birthday dinner and here's what we ordered-
- Black label beer - not for the faint hearted, just saying. Also the metallic mug is cute.
- fresh lime soda - I like how they serve these without frills like fancy glasses and cherries and all. To the point :P
- Dry chilli chicken - Best chilli chicken I've had in a while. No useless thick cornflour covering. Meaty pieces with just the right amount of chilli. Ended up ordering multiple plates and ruining our appetite but worth it.
-Tandoori mixed grill sizzler - Usually we go for the chello kebab but this time we felt like some drama so the sizzlers came, amped with fish, chicken, mutton, egg and prawn. If the chilli chicken didn't satiate the non veg lover in us, this surely did.

The service was pretty great this time, which is something I observe here less because of the rush and the huge footfall. We were served fast and hot and the AC was adjusted when asked. Would've loved to order more but the quantity was huge. Nice to see these guys maintain the old tradition of generosity and no nonsense food.

Wow. Long time dream came true the evening I visited this legendary outlet located right in the heart of the city in the Park Street area. 

Had to order Chello Kebab there, so I did. And then all the praises I had heard for this very dish fell short of the ecstacy I felt after actually having it there. I don't want to rate the food, it's an experience every foodie should have in his lifetime.

P.S- I did not have the capacity nor the wish to have anything after Chello Kebab, that disturbed the buttery taste of the kebabs and rice I had in my mouth.

This restaurant is very hyped one even though there is nothing special about the same. I have seen its most famous dish, the Chello Kabab, degrade through the ages and not be "Special" anymore. Yet people have to wait upto 40 mins just to come out again in 20mins saying the same thing. Apart from good enough ambience but could have improved on that more.

Our first visit to this joint was met with a wait for about 2 hours. Although the food was good enough, but the wait drained out all of our enthusiasm for having dinner here. Staffs are friendly, although the serving was pretty slow.

After seeing it's rating of 4.3,we visited Peter Cat recently but had a miserable experience. We ordered Baby corn but there were less baby corns and more capsicums. The vegetable begum bahar was horrible.Nan was too stuffy. The chanachur given for munching was of third grade.

I have been there for 3 times. It is a most popular resturant of park street. Every time I visited this place I have to wait fir some time to get a table, may it be christmas eve or weekend or any busy day of weeks..I have tried their most popular dish chelo kabab and chicken,fish sizzler. I have also tried their biriyni. Biriyani's taste different from other resturnt .its too oily and spicy..over all experience is good.

So I was at Peter cat today. Unusually the place seemed empty and most tables were free. When I was ready to order the waiter would just walk and take one order and without any reason he would just snub and walk away. He came back and I asked for vegetarian options, his reply was there is nothing without onion and garlic besides dal with an attitude like we were beggars begging for food. He walks away again. We waited for a good 15 minutes when I decided to walk out. So it is Peter cat now after Mocambo who have suddenly decided to treat customers like they are at their mercy. Really disappointed.

This is one of the legendary joints that defines Kolkata. The place is known for their brilliant ambience and tasty food.

I got little bit upset with the sitting arrangement though.
Staffs were okayish. 
Coming back to food, we took baked fish sizzler and mixed tandoor grill sizzler.
What we loved is only the food and nothing else. They were all well cooked and quality is amazing.
We took mango juice, fresh and pure.
Finally we took ice-cream.
Would like to visit again only for food. 
Expect well behaved staffs from the next time.

A friend had come over for the weekend so we decided to hit up the usual peter cat dinner do. It was a Sunday and so we had to wait for an hour before getting the food. Ordered Kasturi kebab, makhmali fish, chelo kebab, chicken steak and sizzler. Unfortunately, food was a big miss. I don't know if they have changed the chef or it was just rush hour because pretty much everything was under seasoned and not worth the wait. People wait to get into this joint because the food is usually worth it. Sadly, not the case this time.

The place came very highly recommended - but I found it over rated.
We were warned that the place would have waiting - but it only took 5 mins to get a table. The place is a little dingy, the waiters a little distracted (we ordered two fresh limes, one with water one with soda, both salted. When they came - both were sweet). The menu on the top looks adorable! 
We ordered the dum ki raan to start (delicious, meat was very tender), the chicken steak sizzler (nice) and their speciality kebab served with rice (nice).
Overall ok - but nothing that blew us away

My favourite place to eat in all of Kolkata! Visited this place for the first time two years back when I could hardly afford it. Saved up for a time, just because Peter Cat. Chello kebab, sizzlers... Also the chicken biryani are heavenly. I remember having peas pulao here as well, and God! did it taste good. Such a plain dish, prepared with such meticulous care.
When I got my first job, I knew where to take my family for dinner. I just knew it. They profusely appreciated the Chello kebab.
Peter Cat is the reason why I became a foodie. I'll never miss an opportunity to have a meal here. If need be, I'll make the opportunities myself.

However, the ambiance is pretty good, despite the fact that the tables for two are quite‚Äã small to accommodate all the plates, glasses n cutleries.

The food is excellent, serving time is fast enough. Staffs are nice n attentive.

I have been a patron here since I was a child. Their fabled Chelo kabab is a tribute to all meat lovers. I have tried their sizzlers and marakesh too but the chelo kabab has not ceased to amaze me. I have ordered it everytime I have been there in the last 20 years and it was 120 rupees when I first ordered it. The price might have increased keeping with the times but it is still a complete meal in itself so you don't need to order anything else but a drink to go with it. Quality, service and reasonable pricing still make Peter Cat my go to restaurant whenever I am back in the City of Joy. I consider it a pilgrimage for foodies like me.

One of Kolkata's legendary outlets, Peter Cat is synonymous with good food and congenial service. We visited for a weekend dinner, as usual had to wait in a queue for half an hour. The seating arrangement could have been better though the ambience especially the lighting makes it up. Coming to the culinary fares, Chello kebab is still the 'must try' item and for a reason. On the downside, the quality of the sizzlers have deteriorated a bit. Ordered a drink as well, nothing was really extraordinary. However, the service is very commendable.

Park Street is bustling with food joints and this one is highly recommended. Massive waiting during lunch hours on a weekday can tell you much about it's popularity. Tried the Chello Kebab. Quite liked it but I felt the chicken was about dry but maybe that's just me. The kabuli naan was the scene stealer. Sufficient for 3-4 people. It's an Afghan version of a Pizza if you ask me. Delicious. No need for any gravy, can be eaten alone.

We ordered a classic chello kebab and a house special sizzler. The sizzler was excellent. The chello however disappointed me a bit as the chicken kebabs and the rice were not hot at all. I hope the next visit won't be like this. The taste was impeccable and unparalleled. Strongly recommended.

Located just opposite to KFC is one of the most renowned restaurants of the city. The place is known for their brilliant ambience and tasty food. 

This is my second visit in 5 years, the previous visit disappointed me with the quantity and thus had decided against standing in the long queues all this time. But something urged me to visit the place again, and ta-da, it worked like magic. The food was as good as expected. Although the freshness of the bhetki in the fish meuni√©re made me skeptical, but the entire taste of the dish made up for it. Then ordered the pork sirloin steak. The sizzler came with two succulent pieces of pork, cooked to perfection. The taste of the sauce was perfect. I was glad I visited the place! 

Don't forget to visit the place!

Yes, the one and only CHELO KABAB. It renders me speechless...
Chicken Marakesh is also good. Among the sizzlers specialities, Grilled Chicken and Grilled Fish seem to be a non-vegetarian's delight, so I have felt. But I like the Chicken Steak best among the Sizzlers.
Fish Makhmali would satiate one. In soups, I would recommend Cream of Spring Chicken, Cream of Sweet Corn.
The service is remarkable. I would even say the standard of service is pretty much better than most restaurants.
Last but not the least is the lovely ambience. The decor is old school with dim orange lights hanging just above the table. There are two floors, I prefer the downstairs when I'm with family. I love the big round table for 7-8 people when we feast on upstairs.
I think I will never get tired of this place.
N.B.- During festivals and Sundays, please ensure your reservation as this is a popular place and one might not get a table immediately.

The staff are uncourteous n rude. Served us "cold"  sizzler(whoever heard of that???) n after repeated requests, heated it in the microwave n served it again. 

I guess the non veg food here might be great
But the veg dishes were total disaapointment. If you arent going to spend any effort in preparing veg dishes, then why not take it off thr menu?? üò†

This w√†s my first visit to Peter Cat. Chelo Kababs were not upto the mark. There are better kababs than this. Dont know why it is hyped so much. We also ordered Chicken steak and Grilled Fish. Fish was slightly better. Chicken steak again was not upto the mark. Chicken flesh was quite hard to bite. It was not tender. 
The overall ambience of the place was good with dim lights. But the spacing was cramped. There were small tables which could hardly keep all the  dishes in one go. Overall my first visit was not satisfactory to this highly hyped restaurant at Park Street.

Heard about the place a lot and finally visited the restaurant yesterday. After almost an hour of waiting, we went for the much acclaimed Chelo Kabab.
The rice with the poached egg was nice and the chicken tandoor was to die for. But the mutton tikka could have been a lot better.
We were seated in the ground floor and the place was pretty much overcrowded and dingy. Waiters were pretty nice and cordial.
All in all, a nice place with not really extraordinary food. Some work needs to be done to the seating arrangement. And the fire alarms
The sizzlers in the adjacent table ticked the alarm.

I have been to Peter cat twice,and both the times had their chello kabab which is their signature dish I believe. It's good but mutton seekh kabab was dry for me,but chicken was juicy overall it's good.i also had their makhmali fish which was too good,its just melts in your mouth,i ll recommend this dish to every one. their cocktails are reasonable. If you go on weekends be prepared for waiting time. This place is a must visit .

Some place are beyond rating and Peter Cat is one of them. Decided to visit Peter Cat on a work trip to Kolkata and I am so glad I did. Had to wait 15 minutes to get a table but all the wait was worth it. Tried the famous Chello Kabab (veg), kababs were juicy and flavourful. Also tried their special Orange soufflet which again was full of flavour and proper texture. Cant wait to come back here and try other stuff. Thanks Peter Cat fot the amazing experience.

Peter Cat, one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata, never fails to impress an individual right from the entry to the restuarant to the last bite of the food. Dimly lit interiors and its location adds a sophisticated feel to this place. Famous for its Chello Kebabs and Chicken Steak Sizzlers, I tried them both on my last visit to this place few days back on Saraswati Puja day. Though I've visited earlier too, but I will share my last experience only.

We reached there at nearly 1pm, and only two tables were left to be occupied. The waiters had a dress code, which seems to take back in time to the kings' era. Each and every detail adds to it's sophisticated feel. However, when it comes to the food, the first item that I tasted was Chello Kebab. The kebabs were perfect. It simply melted in my mouth. The rice with it was good too. Now coming to the House Special Chicken Steak Sizzler, it was good, but not the best. I've tasted better Chicken Steak. In fact, it was better when I last visited this place. Next we ordered Tutti Fruti Ice cream. It was again Ok-ish.

So in conclusion, Peter Cat was once one of the best restaurants in the city, but the quality is not the best anymore. Reason may be:
1. The quality they offer has degraded.
2. Other options have come into picture which are of similar quality, or sometimes even better.

It's undoubtedly one of the best restaurants which I've tried in Kolkata. The ambience inside is a kind of vintage but the decors are superb and very sophisticated though it's an upscale place. The restaurant itself is a class apart it has a very less amount of lights for ambience. And the food over here is also very high in standard. We ordered a lot of stuffs like Biriyanis, Chicken Kormas, Chicken Butter Masala and obviously Chelo Kababs. Each and every food were very good in taste and we're satisfied with the service.

The only thing that comes to mind when I hear Peter Cat is chelo kabeb! That is our "go to" dish when we are craving some really tasty food. Getting a table is difficult but lucky for my husband and me
, a cozy little table for 2 is available after only a short wait. We only eat chelo but on a rare occasion I've tried the mutton raan, chicken sizzlers and desserts.

A name with high repute. 
A place where long queues of people waiting to eat can be easily observed in any given holiday. 
The decor and ambience is decent. 

Famous for its chollo kebab. 
People always try this here. 

Quantity wise ok. 
But quality has degraded over time. 

I hardly risked anything else here.

Though the overall food quality is good here.. 

The waiters are more on the extreme professional side with slight hint of rudeness in the mix.

And we felt very  uneasy after eating lunch.. I did not know that the things were one time fault or not but surely I never visit again...

There is a certain ambiguity to the whole place. The name, the decor and the food just don't add up. The Ambience is more of dingy than warm and sophisticated. But you can sense that nobody cares because the food probably has been so consistent and delicious. I instantly fall in love with a restaurant that serves free snacks with drinks. The old school mixture in a bowl was served with beer. And the beer came in a big brass mug. Wanted to steal it! And then ordered the Chelo kebab. But truth be told, it's all about the delicate butter rice that is served along with the mutton seekh and chicken tikka type kebabs. There's nothing special about the grilled stuff but the rice just lifts everything up. The vegetable sizzler was not the best though. All in all a place one must step into but not expect too much. Have some beer and eat a lot of mixture. Life's good.

When it comes to chelo.kebab and sizzlers No one in kolkata can beat Petercat. Nomatter how long the queue is even on weekdays, the waiting outside  is worthwhile.  Though the chelo kebab  and sizzlers are the signature dishes, but I would also recommend tandoori lovers to try their chicken tandoori and other north kebabs too.. Though I am partial to chelo and always will be..üíù

So this was our first encounter with the infamous restaurant that Kolkata is literally known for. We were a group of eight people and went there last year in the Christmas week. Luckily we didn't have to wait long. As for the ambience, it's got dim lighting and a soothing music but was too crowded and looked cramped, maybe due to Christmas. The larger groups are accommodated upstairs.
The service was prompt and the waiters were well aware of the menu. Coming to the food, we ordered prawn cocktails and their special kebabs (chicken reshmi, that day). The prawn cocktails were not the the bona fid√© ones, just a bunch of prawns flooded in a cheesy dip- yummy but not appealing. For the mains we ordered the much raved chellos- the rice was soft and buttery but the chicken seekh majorly lacked seasoning. Then we went for the Dum ki Rann, which was the best we tried there- a Must for everyone! Then we'd the chicken steak which comes with two steaks, sausages, livers and veggies; a full dish in itself. But it's better to be missed. The food turned out kinda disappointing, will have to give it a try without occasions though.
For desert, we ordered the brownie with hot sauce and the tutti-fruity ice cream; both were commendable. In all it amounted to around 5.2k along with a couple beers. Giving it 4 stars only for the Dum ki Rann, deserts and the service. But petercat, with all its charms, failed to impress me.

The only place in Kolkata that is synonymous with Chelo Kabab. They have perfected the national dish of Iran like none other. But Peter Cat offers much more than just that. Their Tandoori Chicken is at par with the best Mughlai restaurants in town (if not better). The sizzlers are popular too. Their kababs are a must-have. Succulent meat is something you will find in all their dishes. 
Peter Cat always has a long queue of people outside regardless of the day of the week. If it is a weekend or a holiday, be prepared to wait for an hour to taste the amazing food waiting inside. 
Being one of the heritage restaurants in Park Street, Peter Cat still retains that old world charm with its dim lighting and antique furniture. There is not much in terms of decor. But what it lacks in decor and ambience, it makes up in food.

Chello kebab is undoubtedly thr best dish. The sizzlers are also worth a try. And last but not the least, caramel custard is a must in the desert section. I have visited the restaurant for times unknown, and the food here never gets boring. My eternal love for Peter Cat!!

Get here in good time and you won't have to wait in line outside. We were let in within 10 minutes of reaching the place but while leaving we saw quite a queue of people waiting for their lunch.
We ordered the chicken steak sizzler, a Peter Cat classic. And we were not disappointed. It came with a small bowl full of cubes of butter which delighted my friend very much. It was quite filling by itself and delicious.
Give the place a try if you haven't already.

Legendary? Yes. 

You cant go wrong with this place. It brings the essence of what Kolkata actually is. After waiting for an hour and half we finally got a table. Chelo Kebabs and Tandoori Broccoli. The food was amazing. Spot on. Its worth the money. Worth the time you wait for your table. Its a legendary place. Authentic and tastes amazing. A newbie to Kolkata should try this place for sure. It brings out what Kolkata is all about. The one restaurant you should visit to eat the chelo kebabs. Food doesn't get better than this.

If people ask me to recommend restraunts they should visit when they come to Kolkata, Peter Cat always makes it to the suggestion list. Located at the heart of the city, Park Street, this place is a classic. There are two dishes I'd recommend, and I have them alternately each time I go:

1. Non veg Chelo Kebab
(Delicious, aromatic chicken reshmi kebab, mutton sheikh kebab served in a bed of rice with dollops of butter and a fried egg on top. It's delicious.)

2. Chicken steak sizzler

The only drawback of this place is the huge queues (minimum one hour waiting time during peak hours). Reach there before 1pm for lunch and before 7:30pm for dinner and you should be good.

A truly legendary restaurant of Calcutta, the location, the ambience, the name, the food and everything else about Peter Cat has a sense of sophistication and nostalgia as this restaurant has been one of the landmarks of the city since long time back. Love everything about them. The staff are very courteous, the interiors are decorated extremely well and defines a classy approach. The food is really good. Specially the sizzlers and the chello kebabs. Cost is also not very high.

Came here at 6;30 PM on a weekday with a couple of friends. We were seated promptly and given menus but the waiters took forever to come take our order. 

We ordered 2 drinks, the tandoori broccoli, the chelo kebab and a chicken sizzler. 

The drinks took about 10 mins but the food took over 40 mins to come! The drink I got was called 'The Wedding Night' and it was one of the most bland and tasteless cocktails I've ever had. 
When we requested a steak knife for the sizzler the waiter just said they didn't give steak knives and walked away rather rudely. Nobody asked us if we liked the food or wanted anything else.
The tandoori broccoli and chelo were tasty, but I'm not sure if they were worth the wait. The chicken sizzler was quite average. 

Giving it 3.5/5 for the quality of food and ambience but a definite 1/5 for the service.

A good place to be..
The restaurant situated in the heart of the city so being there is quite easy. As you enter the place you are welcomed by warm smiles. The ambiance is dark and some old classy touch, and the staffs are polite. But the waiting area is very excruciating as they don't book a table for us. As the restaurant is very much popular so there was too much crowded. We wait there for around 10 minutes as we were 2.
The menu offers a wide variety but the main rush for there special and most popular dish which is the "Chelo Kabab". So like everyone we also ordered it and it was awesome. It is a complete meal for one. There was two types of Kababs, one is chicken kabab and another is mutton kabab. There was soft and extremely delicious pulao like rice and a perfectly poached egg. With it there was a baked tomato which compliment the platter gracefully. It all followed by a delicious a ice-cream which is average. The products were quite fresh and warm. Chelo Kabab is their speciality so I would highly recommend to try it once. You don't need anything else. I will be there again to try their other dishes. :-D :-)

The menu is really healthy and tasty.kebabs was nicely soft and cooked,but the taste of mutton kebab was so much good,even I couldn't ate the whole piece as the salt was less and not so tasty.otherwise,overall I will give 4.Chelo kebab is not so special as they are doing marketing for that.

You must have faced this "you are in Kolkata and you haven't tried chelo kebab"...Yes! You've found the right place. It's Peter Cat where you'll get this legendary dish. 
But trust me, it's not only about chelo kebab, do try the other dishes too. The sizzlers! they are amazing. 
I've even tried the Kabuli naan here for the first time....It's delectable! 
I don't think I need to write more. My rating says it all.

The legen-wait for it-dary restaurant gets almost everything right when it comes to serving the perfect meal. Awesome food, affordable prices, great ambience, friendly staff and the list goes on. Even though people love the Chelo Kebab and the Chicken Sizzler, I personally found the Grilled Fish Sizzler to be their best dish. The desserts are delicious too. Especially the Brownie. The chocolate sauce they serve has a distinct egg-like taste which makes it more tasty. I'd choose this restaurant any day over any other restaurant in the city (even Mocambo). The only downside is the queue you have to be in to get a table even on weekday afternoons. But isn't that the proof of how great this place is?
P.S. A useful tip for first timers is to avoid all the passionately recommended dishes. Do this and you'll come out with an amazing experience of a mind blowing meal.

You ask anyone in Kolkata, if there is one must visit place they all tell you try the chello kebab in Peter Cat. So I just had to see what the fuss was all about. The restaurant is located in one of the nice spots in Kolkata very close to the Flurry's. It's pretty big but try to get here early because they are always crowded and you will have to wait. The decor is nice and the lighting dim. The staff is also pretty polite. Now cominf to the food I only tried the chello kebab because that's a full meal and it was really good. The meat is cooked to absolute perfection, the rice with butter is delicious and works well overall. It's a filling meal but doesn't leave you feeling bloated. There is no masala and that's the best part about the dish.

Worst experience...Over hyped place...

Been there on 28th December 2016...felt the desperate need to start online booking..We waited around 1.5 hours on the street. One of the person in the queue asked for a glass of water while waiting...guess what it was not being served and the person was instructed to buy and get it..!!!!!
Pathetic condition.Rude behaviour..Management of the place write names of the people in a paper...Cant believe its 21st century and the time of online reservation.

Not a great fan of Chello kabab..didnt feel anything extraordinary.

Adviced management to start online booking and start a new branch as well..

Peter cat just never fails to impress. Great food! The chelo kebab is to die for! Great service and ambience as well. Only problem is that because it's so good there's often a waiting line for it, even on weekdays.

Easily the best continental place in Kolkata and definitely should be on the list for all foodies and tourists. 

Just leaves you with a great feeling. Hope the quality never goes down as it hasn't in so many years.

Chelo Kebab. Chicken Steak Sizzler. Enough said! Just for these two dishes should anyone go to Peter Cat and go again and again, like I have since I was a kid. The place has not changed in ambience or quality of food since ages! The food is really good and thankfully moderately priced. They have not hiked up their prices even though the crowd there is simply too much even on weekdays! We have to wait a minimum of half hour if not more to be seated!
But the wait is worth it. The only point is that the management needs to spruce up the place and maintain the interiors a bit more. The waiters and servers are very cordial with always a kind word and patience. Lighting and interiors need to be seriously looked at!

I won't talk about the ambience because food is what matters to me the most..but the place is over-crowded on weekends..the fame it has is definitely due to the sizzlers they serve..indeed one of the best sizzlers in town,amazingly tasty(tried out the chicken steak sizzler),though a bit complicated with so many steamed vegetables,yet i would say one of the best restaurants to go with family or friends..visiting this place is must for people of Kolkata(but avoid visiting on weekends)..try out chelo kababs as well..

Peter Cat is never quite most of the time you need to wait but while digging into chelo kabab you will forget everything else... Lovely food, ambiance, service. Price is moderate. After all it's one of those legends of Park Street. Must try is the CHELO KABAB. I strongly recommend this to all my friends who are still waiting to visit here. It's filling, tasty and has the world of taste in one plate. Go for the cooler, the sizzlers, dessert. You will find all of them awesome.

This place needs no review i presume. We will still visit Peter Cat, we will order our Chelo Kebabs and talk about good old days. This place really gives me a feeling that happy days are back and gives me a sense of comfort. The food does not need any endorsement. The drinks are good old bar drinks and the warmth makes me think that not all is wrong with this world.
It just makes me a tad bit sad, that getting a table is so much of a fight :( somehow that needs to be taken care off! Else - happy days!

The amount of time you wait outside the restaurant is directly proportional to the taste of the food you are going to have there! Such amazing quality of food they provide.

It's a really good fine dine restaurant in the city of joy. The ambiance is pretty classy with dark red theme and waiters are dressed in some irani style costumes but you will have to wait outside in the rush hours for your turn. Chelo Kebab is their specialty so you must try it, they also serve liquor so it was overall a good fine dining experience.

One of the legendary restaurants in kolkata. Great kebabs and yummy sizzling platters! The ambience is dark and some old classy touch, makes it even better. The service is good, and the food is too good. Little expensive I guess but  Worth going to if you're in Park street. Also, they served hard drinks, specially they served beer in a  frosty metal mugs - nice touch! This place is famous for the chelo kebab, tried it! good. Nice place for family dinner..

Finally visited the ever popular Peter Cat this weekend and we arrived at around 12:45pm and immediately got a seat here. By then, the restaurant was almost packed with only a few seats remaining empty.

Coming to the food, we ordered¬†
1. Chicken Irani Kabab
2. Chelo Kabab (Chicken)

The Irani Kabab was delicious and the chicken pieces were tender but a bit cold when served. Also, the chicken pieces were smaller compared to what you get in Arsalan and Aminia.¬†But like I said, it tasted really good coupled with the salad.

The Chelo Kabab met my expectations and it was delicious. The portion looked average at first but at the end, I really struggled a little to finish it. There are a couple of mutton sausages included with the dish and in my opinion, it tasted really good with the rice, else average when eaten as a standalone item.

Wasn't able to have the sizzlers this time but I am hoping to go back once more to taste them as well. All in all, it was a good experience and the bill came around Rs 3100 for five people which is a bit higher than average.

Who can quench the thirst for 'Chelo Kababs' and Sizzlers better than them!!!! It's worth waiting for more than half an hour for having a seat (reserve your seat earlier, please). I wonder how I spent 3 hours with Tandoori Mixed grill Sizzlers, chelo Kabab, prawn moctail and vodka. The eye soothing interior and gloomy lights gave me the perfect mood. 
Love the concept of their bar menu; especially the cocktail names and illustrations.  Visits over visit won't be able to satisfy the crave for their food.

Chelo Kebab. Yes, if you are a fan of that Iranian dish then look no further than Peter Cat. Even if you are in Kolkata and type in "Chelo Kebab" on Google, you will see the name of Peter Cat being suggested to you. That is how good this place is in terms of food. Even though the price is towards the steeper side, but the heritage that this restaurant carries with it along with the consistently well cooked food especially their specialities are a treat to savor. This is a must visit restaurant in Kolkata.

One of the oldest restaurants which has successfully maintained its position as one of the top among the leading food joints. The ambience is very nice with dim lights and nicely decorated lanterns. The service is commendable and they try to serve your order as fast as possible. You have not tasted anything if you have not had the world famous Chelo Kebab at Peter Cat. Whenever I have visited this place, Chelo kebab and Sizzlers are a must. North Indian food is their speciality and I love their kebab dishes. The chef's special dishes are a must try. They serve various cocktails and beverages as well. The price is also reasonable. This restaurant at the heart of the city is a must visit for everyone.

Iced coffee and tooti fruti were highly enjoyable and refreshing .

Pocket pinch is bit high but food quality is fabulous.

One of the most sought after and coveted restaurants of the 90's Peter Cat has been the hub of cult dining for generations.You would be considered really lucky if you managed to get a seat here on weekends and many times we had to settle¬†for other restaurants because of the heavy rush of diners outside ethe joint.I am talking of the 90's when Park Street was symbolic of good food and booze.
I have been to this place many times with my peeps, my last visit was on a Saturday in December¬†2016 with a bunch of my colleagues.As I was the first to arrive at the venue I placed a request for a table for 8 and they happily told me it was available.We started with two rounds of chicken kebabs, "Irani Kebab" and "Today's Special kebab".Service time could have been better(I cannot wait long at my table after the order has been placed).The kebabs were soft, delicious and perfectly cooked though I felt that they are diminishing in size over the years.
Chelo Kebab was the popular choice for six of the gang, the dish which Peter Cat has been a pioneer of.I ordered my favorite "Grilled Chicken Sizzler"(though I was determined to try the Chelo too).While the sizzler was taking time, I saw the familiar white plates arrive with boiled long-grained rice, topped with a dollop of butter melting in the rice, with a poached egg on top, sunny side up, and embellished with strings of kebabs on either side. As the others dug into the platter and we all chatted about our work-lives , I managed to get a few kebabs from their plates and it was lip-smacking with the familiar taste of the Persian herbs.The sizzler arrived with fumes and the customary buzz, and as I savored the soft chicken with pieces of the baked vegetables and specially the golden brown coloured potatotes¬†which exude a sweet taste as you bite in, I felt ecstacy.
But then I missed the friendly staff people and the service which Peter Cat once offered.Everything else was the same, the taste, the aroma, the buzz, the dim secretive lighting and the famous golden cat with hollow black eyes on the menu card!If you love your kebabs, find your way to this place.

The place which describes KOLKATA.
Nostalgic, historical with a touch of love from British. I have been a loyal customer from the last 14 years . From parents, teachers, friends to girlfriends and many more . Reason of  visiting a place to eat differs but the reason of visiting the place is same .... 
Sizzlers and Chelo Kabab . No need of further description. Very sincerely I would like to appeal everyone to please visit this place and order the 2 items and I leave the rest to you. From the last 10 years I'm staying outside Kolkata and being a foodie I have visited various restaurants all across the country. I tried to search the similar taste which I never found and I understood it is not possible to find as well.

For nearly 20 years I have been visiting this place religiously. However lately I don't see the good old peter cat anymore. Their quality of the food has deteriorated quite a lot be it their steaks or their chelo kebab. I feel they are lacking infrastructure greatly and for some crazy reason they don't want to expand. They feel along with their unique food they have found a unique marketing channel ie whenever you go there is a swarm of people waiting patiently outside and thinking when will they grab their chelo or their sizzler. 
I hope the old patrons of this restaurant would also share the same view.

One of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata, Peter Cat lies in the famous Park Street. You would be able to recognize Peter Cat by the pretty long queue of people waiting outside the restaurant for their turn. Coming to the meals, this place is famous for two major dishes. First, the chelo kebab, second, the sizzler. The chelo kebab is a beautiful dish with two types of kebabs, buttery rice and a fried egg on top of it. During my recent visits, I felt that the kebabs are made from frozen kebabs, which, if true, would be very disappointing for any food lover. I switched to the sizzler, which has been the top dish for me. The ambience is a dimly lit, cozy place, which is a beautiful setting for a romantic meal, but not really great for large groups planning on 'adda'.
All in all, one must visit Peter Cat at least once, when in Kolkata. But, please plan ahead and avoid weekends to avoid the queue.

Also I would like to suggest mutton nawabi which is boneless garvy of muttons balls and goes well with Indian breads.. If you are visiting this place before 7 then you might get a seat but after 7:30 needs a waiting time of 40-45 mins especially on weekends..

The chelo kebab dish served is a LEGEND! That is the single most ordered item on the menu everyday.
Another dish which is not so famous yet i loved it was the grilled cheese chicken sandwich . it got the bengal touch due to addition of mustard.
Pineapple blossom a must try drink here.
Would recommened to go in theafternoons to skip the long que which is almost everyday in the evening!

We went to Peter Cat for lunch on Wednesday but still there was a huge queue and we had to wait for 45 mins to get a seat. We ordered Today's special chicken kebab, Chello kebab, Chicken Reshmi butter masala and naan. The Chello kebab was a meal in itself with lots of butter. The taste of the items was ok not very extraordinary. However the service was too slow despite the heavy rush outside. Go there to experience the old legend of Kolkata.

This is the only place where I can think of standing in a queue to have a meal. Being a  popular joint all over India, it has maintained its aura and class when it comes to fine dining.

Peter Cat, the place of Chelo Kebabs and Sizzlers, for me. Vegetarians, strictly go for the Mixed Grill Sizzler. I had the vegetable steak sizzler for the first time yesterday, and it is missable. Just stick to the mixed grill. With the cutest of tumblers embossed with the peter cat, the experience was definitely enhanced. They forgot to serve my veg sizzler and got it only after a couple of reminders. I was reduced to waiting, munching on chanachur while my friends enjoyed their Original Chelo Kebab (mutton and chicken). But it's okay, the world is mean to vegetarians, Peter Cat is forgiven too! ;-)

Me and my friends went to the restaurant twice once on 25th dec afternoon for lunch and on 26th dec evening for dinner. Both the days we ordered the same stuff which is our favourite, The Veg and Non Veg Chello kabab platters and fish makhmali. The fish makhmali was good but the chello kabab the much hyped dish was just disaster on 25th, no salt and the seekh kabab tasted awful. Nevertheless we thought due to extreme rush this was the scenario, next day when we order the same stuff with two glass of whisky and rum, we experienced that though it was not crowded the service was poor, highly late and slow, for almost 10mins no waiter come up to our table to take our order and have to call them literally to take the order. The food served, it looked great but tasted bad, the seekh kabab in the veg was extremely dry, crispy and bad, it tasted worst than on christmas day, i couldnt eat after the first bite and the non veg seekh kabab also tasted awful. From a restaurant like this, such food and services was not expected from them. I wasted almost 6000 for the awful food and service. In my life i wont order the Chello Kabab Platter anymore.

You are ought to fall in love with the mouth watering chelo kebab for sure. Well, it is the signature dish so it's ought to taste the best but trust me I went for the sizzlers too and you will want to come back for the roast chicken sizzler. If you are here for a snack do grab a chicken omlette or maybe cheese. Both are extra ordinarity good and will melt in your mouth. For the ones who have a sweet tooth do try the Strawberry Crush and the ice- creams. They will complete your meal for sure!

This one has been in my bucket list for a long time. Just to try their famous chello kabab. I was not disappointed. My friend had chicken marakesh, which is almost similar to the chello kabab. Along with that we took some cocktails. It was an overall great experience, simple and impressive.

Right on the heart of Park Street, Peter Cat is a place known to every Calcutta Connoisseurs. There is long queue during weekends and holidays. Hence my expectation was on the higher side when I visited this restaurant on the Christmas week.
It's a well decorated place with reddish hue. Some might say that the partial darkness adds to the grandeur of the place. Their menu cards are a bit different with the picture and cut of a cat, keeping up with the name, I guess. They have a respectable collection of liquor too.
We ordered Fish Makhmali kebab for starters and Chelo Kabab & Chicken Marakesh platter for the main course. The fish item was okayish, nothing so special about it, but it goes well with whiskey for sure.
Despite being their torch bearer, the Chelo Kabab was disappointing. It was hardly warm, hot would be over exaggerating. It might be that due to the high demand, they keep the item ready but I was fairly disappointed. A suggestion to the management that the kebabs can be served right from the kebab sticks on fire. No one likes a cold meal, specially from such a fancy place. Virgin Mary cocktail is not recommended. It tastes like poorly processed tomato puree. 
The staffs are exceptionally courteous. I would come back to this place, may be on weekdays with the hope that I get to enjoy my Chelo Kebab hot and steamy.
Happy dining! üòä

Yesterday on the cristmas eve i and my friend planned a visit to this authentic restaurant famous for its chicken chelos. It was my very first visit and was a Memorable one. Although it was a bit chaotic outside beacause of the occasion but they managed their guests very well.
To begin with the food experience, the order had to have a chicken chelo platter n we insisted on having a sizzler (roasted chicken) which too is a signature dish of the place. All the meats were Cooked to perfection and the veggies were having the perfect crunch.
All in all a great experience

After I ate the chello kebab, the revered dish for which this place is renowned for, I thought to myself, is something wrong with my taste buds? But a kathi roll outside later, made me realise - it was bland. Had the most bland sizzler and bland kebab. But the service and decor was good, anyways. Whatever the popular view may be, I personally did not like it and its completely my personal opinion quite in contrast to the popular view, but truth is- it was my first and last visit to this restaurant.

Peter Cat was a must-visit in our trip to Kolkata last week. Heard a lot about the place and the Chellos and Fish didn't disappoint.

What we did find needing to improve is something every leader needs to do - continuously improve to stay on top. They can't just rely on good food and the nostalgia attached to the place. The staff needs to get warmer and friendlier, and the cutlery needs to get cleaner; pretty much tidying up.

Potatoes in chicken sizzler were not fresh. Even d baby corn in crispy chilli babycorn was way overcooked. May b they were overflow with orders dats y. But still hoping for better next time.

We were in Kolkata for couple of days and we were puting up in a hotel nearby Park Street. Our friend had told us a lot about this place. We did cross this place a few times and noticed it was crowded all the time.¬†

After a few drinks in nearby pubs we thought of trying out this place for its famous Chelo Kebabs. So we ordered drinks and the much hyped Chelo Kebabs. The restaurant was very simple but was under renovation on the outside. However when our order arrived we were pleasently surprised as we got more than we expected. It was a beautifully presented with a combo of chicken and mutton seekh kebabs, prepared in Persian herbs and rare spices, grilled veggies, salad, half poached egg and butter cubes served on a bed of steamed rice. The experience can't simply be put into words but simply mind blowing.

We loved it and it was worth it.

Have been visiting this place for n number of times since I started growing the sense and taste of food. One of the heritage places in Kolkata, park street. 
Famous for the sizzlers and chelo kebab. 
I have always been a fan of chicken steak sizzler and fascinated by the neon table mats they gave. The slightly tangy sauce and buttered veggies add a freshness to the rich steak. Absolutely love love it.

Chelo kebab is in itself a one man army ! Loaded with chicken and mutton sheekh and grilled kebabs served with buttered rice and poached egg. 
Also the prawn cocktail here is a speciality. Cold and subtle, you will enjoy if you are a continental food lover. 
Chicken cold salad, is also a must bhabe every time I visit. Solid chicken wedges with light mayo and lettuce. Perfect with a slider and beer !

Visited this place for a sumptuous lunch.First of all,I got a convenient parking space just opposite the restro.....the decor,according to me,is nothing very special and the light is very dim for clicking photographs(of course,not for DSLR ppl).....coming to the food, it's obviously excellent....the veg chello kebab and sandwich were awesome but coming to the dessert,I feel that with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce they should give a chocolate or vanilla flavoured wafer but not Strawberry which destroys the taste and feel of the dessert....coming to the service,it was pathetic.....the waiters were looking at us like dumb people when they were asked some questions.....they have to literally pump up their service.....overall,a good experience only because of the food.....

Tried their legendary Chelo Kebabs. First morsel in and immediately understood all the hullabaloo around it. It is the most amazing thing I have had in ages!!!! The melt in your mouth paneer cubes (yes, I ordered veg Chelo Kebabs) and the buttery rice... Cannot even begin to explain the burst of flavors!!! We also ordered some biriyani and raita which was equally delicious, but needless to say, chelo kebabs were the star of the day! The only reason I am not giving this place a full five is service. Really pathetic, slow and incompetent waiting staff. Had to wave at least 10 mins every time to grab their attention even to refill water or ask for our bill. Would definitely return for the food though.

Finally lunched at Peter cat yesterday. We were a group of 9 and we're seated at the corner table upstairs. It was stuffy and seating is very tight. A long queue outside the restaurant from lunch hours. Saw the queue when we left the restaurant as well.

Coming to food the starters of chicken, mutton kebabs and lassi, drinks etc were savoured by the group. It took some time to get the food yesterday. 

Main course ordered was primarily chelo kebabs, sizzlers and North Indian curry and naan. Chelo kebabs is yum.. Wanted only chicken option but the staff refused üò≥to replace the mutton portion with chicken.
Sizzlers are served without bread, it has to be ordered separately here.

Overall nice food. But always crowded ..

After almost 10 years visited Peter Cat which used to be my favorite place during my college days.
Ambience, the crowd was as good as before. Felt nostalgic while waiting in the queue.¬†

Chelo Kabab was my all time favourite back then so I just ordered it straight away.¬†
But this time around I didn't enjoy my Chelo Kabab like I used to. Either they have deteriorated or may be I've "tried and tasted" a lot of good food in all these years to anymore enjoy Chelo Kabab.

It was Christmas season and the waiting outside the restaurant was unbelievable. I had recently heard of Peter cat and the chelo kebabs from a friend and hence decided to visit it this time upon my visit to Kolkata. There's an extensive hype surrounding this place. The crowd is extravagant and you literally have celebrities coming in every once in a while. Despite the crowd,  the staff manages everything pretty smoothly and in a polite manner. We were promptly seated on the first floor and offered the menu. The seating arrangement is aptly spaced out and there's no cramping. Without much ado,  we promptly decided to go for the famous chelo kebabs. The food came in,  in about 15-20 mins. The presentation of the kebabs is impressive. The central part is occupied with steamed rice topped with fried egg. The kebabs and the veggies occupy the periphery. Much like an English breakfast. Having said that that,  the taste isn't really something to die for. Frankly,  the taste is pretty ordinary. One platter is sufficient for one person. The sizzlers looked pretty tempting as well though I couldn't taste them. One chelo kebab and 2 Pepsi,  we got a bill of Rs. 700 approx. Even though I'd love to try some more options from their menu,  I'm just curious about all the hype around this place. Perhaps ,  just because it's been there for a long time?

Always a big shot restaurant 

Always a nice food

Always a classy crowd

Always a queue. ..


These are tge 4 lines that define this master class restaurant.

The chelo kabab which i heard a lot actually disappointed me as its a mixture of ghee rice and some kabab at 4000 which seems to me not quite apt.

Rest the other kabab platters or indian diahes they made well.

The upstairs dining is also awesome. 

Iverall a nice place in your choice but can't rank this one in the top3 .

Then the other two dishes came to us... Chelo kabab and chicken markesh..... I personally wud rate it 4/5 because the flavour of the chicken n mutton kabab was too similar. I got a monotonous flavour of spices. It was good. Bt 1 dish will b sufficient for 2. And I wanna mention one more thing. The waiters and the workrs were too polite to us.

Peter cat this time... it was good experience . Their signature dish #chelo_kebab_orignal was so good . (4.5 out of 5) . And another kebab I ordered was #chicken_Irani_kebab was awesome I would recommend that too .(5 out of 5). But the #biriyani_ala_nawabi was ordinary one . I expected a lot better than that (2.5 out of 5).  And the side dish  i ordered  with biriyani was #chicken_shahi_korma was good and rich with spice and flavour( 4 out of 5). And the chilled lassi was so refreshing. Dim lights with nice backgrounds and was an extra touch next to mouth watering food .

The dish was perfect, kebabs were soft and tasty. My mom took sizzling Mutton Ran with bread roll which was also nice. All in all it was a good experience with good food and nice ambiance. This place has a charm. But the service could have been better.

The food here needn't be reviewed as is the case with any iconic restaurant.
What really bothered me was the snobbish service attitude. The guy taking orders could learn to smile a bit and be a bit helpful in helping people order. He was curt to the point of being rude.
The worst part was the guy wearing a turban who got the cheque. He just stood there stubbornly until I paid the bill almost making it obvious that I have to tip. This extortion attitude and the pathetic service earlier pissed me off enough and I closed the bill folder without any tips. As I got up to leave the turbaned guy actually opened the bill folder back at me. I gave him a cold stare and he stared right back as if a tip was his birth right. 
As part of my order was a takeaway I decided to wait outside the restaurant for a bit while they prepared and packed it. When I entered again, another suited guy very courteously asked me what I was looking for. I told him about my takeaway. He asked me to wait as he went to figure it out. I saw him talk to the turbaned waiter and once he came back his attitude towards me was suddenly different. He was now very patronising and curt, pointing me to a corner where I should wait. 
All in all the entire service staff works like a cartel where they feel entitled to tips. And have the audacity to belittle people who don't tip. They give an iconic restaurant a bad name and spoil evenings for people wanting to have a good time with friends/family.

The most prestigious fine dinning from old days in town. Well one of my and my family's most preffered restaurants. Specially the chicken steak sizzler which I never forget to order whenever I visit this restaurant as I never had one like they serve. Amongst many other dishes I do like their fish makhmali kebab which is as soft as creme once its inside your mouth. Really love this place from my childhood and will surely drop in again again. Also one of the most talked about platter is chelo kebab which is alomost their identy and unique dish.

I am currently in kolkata , annual vacation. Hence you will all see, posts from my favourite food hangouts in this city.
Today I visited two of my favourite places , Peter cat being one of them. I cannot think of a Calcutta visit (by the way, I still prefer calling this ) without entering this place. The wait time can be long, hence be prepared for that.
The moment you enter, the aroma will add to your hunger. I usually stick to 2 dishes - Marrakesh or chelo kebab, they are a meal in itself, complete meal and you don't need to order anything else after this. One Marrakesh or one chelo kebab is sufficient for one person.if you are in a huge gang order one or two less and will still be sufficient .
This time in addition to this I also tried the Afghani kebab and the Persian rice (its rice with butter and paneer crumbs).
This place never fails , its tried and tasted for years.

I had obviously been to Peter Cat for their chelo kebabs! They were absolutely delicious! mutton seekh with chicken tikka, fragrant rice with warm butter on top, side salad and a perfectly sunny side up! What more can you ask for. A single portion is very filling. We had also got the Veg sizzlers (owing to some vegetarian friends). It was okay, not great. More like potato goodness, rather vegetables.¬†
The Chelo kebab made up for the vegetables though!¬†
The ambiance is great! Very nice to enjoy a quiet and delicious dinner.
Service was good.¬†
Would definitely recommend the chelo kebabs.

This place is known to all for its CHELO KEBABS
Last night me and my new family members (Girlfriend and Her Sister) went to this place after a very long time. It was a Saturday evening and obviously in the month of December Christmas time we had to stand in the queue for no less than 45 minutes to get ourselves a table. The waiting was really painfull. Ugh!

We got ourselves seated and we were super excited to enjoy the delicious dishes of this legendary joint.
We ordered a Tuborg Pint in the beginning. A chilled one.
Then we ordered
Two Chello Kebabs
Chicken Bharta which was really good and Butter Nun

Chello Kebab was okay
But the Bharta took my heart away.

Lastly
Tuttu Frooti came in I loved it.

Will come back again.

Well Well Well....!!!When I think about Peter Cat, one thing that comes to my mind simply are the Sizzlers & Chelo Kababs. Always crowded, as you have to wait in queues during Weekday afternoon & evenings. But the wait is a real worth coz if you're looking to try out some of the best Sizzlers & Chelo Kababs in Kolkata City, then Peter Cat surely makes that bucket list....Burrrrrrpppp..... Special mention for the In-House Sizzlers comprising of Chicken, Mutton, Fish, Veggies...Overall it was a great experience for me. I really think that people who love kebabs( especially chelo kebab), this place is heaven.¬† Definitely worth visiting again and again. .

Went there just after the famous mocambo incident on a rainy day wearing pumps full of water :-p but we were moved by their warm gesture.
The ambience and decor was ancient and dimmy.
Coming to food obviously ordered and liked their famous chello kabab but I personally felt this item is over hyped. We also ordered chicken Irani kabab and fish fry. Both of them were quite delicious.
Go there to revisit decades old Calcutta.

Our sir took us here. One of the cult places in the city. Specially known for the Chello Kebab. The ambience is great. But one thing I did not like at all is the lighting. It's too dark. I can barely see the person sitting opposite me. Its more like having food inside a movie hall. Now coming to the food. I DID NOT LIKE CHELLO KEBAB. And the restaurant is not at all to be blamed for this. I had the dish in another place and it tasted worse.

Interior decoration good.
Position good.
Chilo kebab is ok. Its a hype..the mutton portion of it is very good but chicken portion is just like others. Eat it along with butter,rice, egg poach provided.
Chicken steak sizzler is a very bad menu though u will read in other posts that it's awesome.

My first visit to park street and first restaurant ‚Äì Peter Cat. I went there after a little googling the place and was just flattered by the ambience and the food.

I would definitely give ambience -5/5 , Service -5/5 , Food - 4/5.

¬†

We ordered a mutton and a fish starter which was too good.. the mutton was so soft and tasted perfect. ‚ÄúChello kebab‚Äù as become my all-time fav. However, I feel that they can prepare tomato soup a little better .I will definitely go to this place whenever I am in Kolkata and get time to visit park street. Cheers!!

This is one of the city's oldest culinary establishments, dazzling with it's own charm in the 'Food Street' of Calcutta. The one Place without which the 'food map' of kolkata would be incomplete, has been flaunting it's distinct vibe since it's early days which not only from young to old of the city but also the tourists and celebrities from far and abroad have failed to ignore.
The dining room embrace an atmosphere that harkens back to it's early days in the 70's. It has got a very old school but a classy decor with Tiffany - style lamps and soft lighting.The staffs are very amicable and always trying to serve you to the best of their ability.
I have visited this place several times before as it has become my family's patent restaurant on any sort of family get togethers.
After repeated complains, that I have never tried sizzler, my father again decided to take me to Peter Cat. Although now a days sizzler is available in many restaurants but my father is a big fan of the originality of this place. So basically this was again a family dinner.
Coming to the food, we ordered -
Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler (passionately recomended by them) - which was one of a kind, a star dish according to me, regardless my father's dissatisfaction regarding its deterioration in taste, he as usual ordered his all time favourite Chelo kabab, however, I have never found this dish a very enchanting one, Nawabi Mutton -which was simply finger licking, Afgani Chicken - it was not at all satisfactory in comparison to Peter Cat standar and Tandoori Roti.
Pocket pinch is okay according to the quality of food and service they provide.

Yesterday was a nice evening while returning home after watching Kahani 2 at RDB we were starving for a nice a cosy dinner. We tried a few options there but at last decided to stick to the classic. We came to Peter  Cat, park street. We had tandoori chicken as starter and then carried along with our awsome Chelo Kabab...ummmm, awsome. It was at its best. Had a good time...cheers.

Restaurant details : The restaurant located just besides au bon pain patisserie is one of the famous continental and north indian food leisure in park street kolkata! If you are looking to dine-in, I will recommend making a reservation prior because you wont really like waiting to get those scrumptious dishes in your mouth. 
Food : The food here has its own peculiar taste. The dishes wont ever let you down! I have tried their baked chicken and chelo kebab which is one of the recommended dishes. The chelo kebab is anything one would not want to miss. I will recommend trying it from here rather than any other place, if you dont wanna get disappointed with that mouth watering love. Baked chicken from peter cat is another dish i get hunger panks sitting back in mumbai. The quantity and quality just weight right and what else can one look for? 
Ambience and Hygiene : The ambience is simple with a royal touch! The place is quiet big equated with a royal staircase which takes you to a larger sitting area on the top! The minimal pink hanging lights for each table inturns makes it romantic for a budget friendly fine dine-in for those cupid cuties! The staff is really friendly and the service is real quick! 
Also, if you are someone who likes ordering a lot and looks to take it back home, you can do that here. 
You cannot miss not getting on those lovely meals accompanied with sucha lovely ambience.

Well went there with one of my close relative to try their Special menu that is ofcourse 'The Chelo Kebab".

It was my first time there and I really liked the ambience. The waiters were very much courteous and now coming to the food.

Well what to say about the food when all Calcuttans love it and there is a queue in front of this restaurant specially on Sundays to try the Chelo Kebab.

So Chelo Kebab is really a gorgeous and heavy dish and it will surely made one's day! The kebabs were pretty good and the buttery rice with that yummy egg poach is like heaven in your mouth. We were soo full that we did not think of ordering anything else and sipped on fresh lime soda and bloody mary to refresh up.
Being in Calcutta if you have not been to this place yet then you are really missing out some good food. So give a visit and I also hope to drop by there with my friends gang anyday soon.

Located literally next door to Flurrys on Park Street, Peter Cat is as much a Calcutta culinary landmark as its famous neighbour. But it doesn‚Äôt, as many believe, date back to the Swinging Sixties. Peter Cat originally opened in the middle of the Super Seventies, before which it was known as Omar Khayyam. Is that where the Persian connection came from? I can only wonder. Because there certainly is a connection; how else could Peter Cat‚Äôs famous Chelow Kabab be so close to the Persian original?

An old school restaurant. I had visited it earlier a decade back. In fact, this is the place where I had my first alchoholic drink. But I refrained from making any review earlier as my visit was a decade back. 

I revisited it last week in order to have lunch with a friend. Last time I had prawn cocktail, and I loved it. I had read about its famous chelo kebab and wanted to try it this time.

The restaurant remains the same when I last tried it. No change in decore, but it is well maintained. The sofa were comfy, and so were the chairs, unlike in other restaurants.

The food appeared. It is a wonderful concoction of rice, kebabs,  tikkas and poached egg and roasted tomato. Not very much quantity wise, but extremely delicious.

The waiters bustled around us having numbers pinned to their uniform. No. 11 served us. I appreciated their practiced ways.

Parking space depends upon your luck.

Extremely over rated and disappointing. After 3-4 times of missing it due to huge lines, I finally got to experience it this time. I was not at all impressed. The ambience is ok and somewhat legacy driven but the so called superb and world famous Chelo Kebab was not at all what I expected. Let's just say the butter and rice were the best things on the plate. Too much skew towards Indian cuisine, badly mixed Tom Collins, and not accepting American Express ( sacrilege for an upmarket restaurant)..... made this really disappointing.

It was one of the most awaited places for us and visited there on a very special occasion. It is just a few minutes walk from the park street crossing .

Coming to food, i think the name really says it all . It is a heritage food joint in kolkata. We tried their 'Chelo Kabab(original)' for which this place is famous and it was just exquisite. We also had prawn cocktail and grilled bhetki and both were too good.¬†

Ambiance was fine and service was good, though i think it would have been better if the service was a bit faster.¬†

Overall it was a great experience for us. I really think that people who love kebabs( especially chelo kebab), this place is heaven.¬†

Definitely worth visiting again and again.

This place came highly recommended and it did not disappoint. Very old school feel with red couches and red lamps setting a dark ambience but the food lights up in every aspect. We had original chello kebab and chicken steak sizzler. The chicken steak sizzler had fried chicken in a smooth barbeque sauce served with potatoes, ans vegetables, we ordered a side of dinner roll as well. The chicken was cooked really well and the sauce rich and smooth. The chello kebab waa however the highlight of our meal, two mutton seekh kebabs on one side, chicken skewer kebab on the other, served on a bed of white rice which had a dollop of butter on top. Mix the butter into the rice and have with the egg and meat, just melt in your mouth. Although the chicken skewer was just ok, it was the mutton seekh that was hero of this dish, juicy succulent and mildly spiced, it made a delicious combination with the rice. We also had two cocktail here and they too were very well made. It doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and food is absolutely value for money. Two cocktails, and two mains costed us 1300 rs. They don't add service charge so do leave around some tip.

Someone referred me this place as an iconic restaurant which has been there for over 3 decades so decided to try it. Tried the starters - paneer Tikka which was great- upto the mark, ordered a Tomato Soup which was okay. 

Was suggested the speciality- Chelo Kebab by the server and I went for it, now this dish has rice, fried eggs, chicken Kebab and Mutton seekh all in one plate. 1- the whole thing was too dry for my palates and the kebabs could have been better. All in all a bland dish for me. 

Ambience - 3.5
Service - 4
Food -3

Will give it another try for some more dishes.

I know this place is famous for chalo kebabs but then other things are very expensive which is normal but the problem is the quantity. Such a famous place which serves such less food. I always had chalo kebabs here which is great. But this place is only for chalo kebabs and nothing else. I had a issue with the quantity of the other things as nothing was up to the mark when it comes to the much they charge and they much quantity they serve. The chicken butter masala was having the smallest chicken pieces as possible. And prawn curry also had really less quantity and smallest possible quantities. I seriously wish they increase the quantity as the taste is good.

By far the worst eating experience. Reason? Plain and simple obtuse attitude.
I ordered their signature Chelo kabab and my wife ordered Mutton biryani with Raita.
The Raita was made with sweet curd. We weren't expecting that. On asking to change the Raita and make it with curd which isn't sweet, the manager says..."I've never heard someone ask for non-sweet Raita" and insisted that the kitchen won't change it.
Other than that, this place still oozes the classist attitude and that patrons are done a favor by being served food here.

The taste of each and every dish tried is the same exact way they have served in earlier years. Famous for Chelo Kebab & Sizzlers though I personally like Chicken Marakesh. One plate of any of the above and you sure will be coming back again. My love for the food in this place will never fade away. The best in Park Street area.

Sizzlers are also great and a must try for this place specially the chicken steak.  The tandoori broccoli is a out of the blue dish if you like vegetarian. The problem with the place is its always crowded and you have to wait for 15 minutes to 1 hour to just go inside.

Located at the heart of Park Street, opposite to KFC. 
Generally remains crowded most of the time, as for its legendary tagline. 
Their Chelo Kabab is the signature dish of this place and how, it tastes amazing. Distinct pieces of kabab and good portion of the rice makes the buck worthwhile.
Recommended for sure.

Whenever i visit there i taste nothing but only the chelo kebab. The juicy succlucent tender meats, rice with melted butter. Just like heavenlicious. Staffs are nice. Good ambience. Whenever you visit there will always see a que outside this restaurant. Its so much popular. Price is also pocket friendly. Right now dnt have such good quality picture. So couldn't upload any.

What can I possibly say about Peter cat that hasn't been said in the myriad reviews given above? 

Peter Cat is one of the three legendary outlets of park street. The food here is mostly of the Indian and middle eastern cuisine.¬†

They live up to the expectations when you enter their restaurant . The ambiance is great . The dim lighting for the dinners are perfectly set.Ah yes...how can i forget about their amazing cello kebabs? No review is complete without them..It is one dish i can go on writing about forever.....loved the service, the food, and the hospitality...

Hats off to you Peter Cat...

Firstly, to clarify, this rating of 1.0 is NOT pertaining to the quality/taste of food for which it easily deserves a 5.0! However, being in the "foodservice" industry, if "service" is the least thing a restaurant is bothered about, it DEFINITELY calls for corrective actions (and a bad review). First instance of "service": my sister, who reached there first n was waiting fr us to join, was asked to wait outside inspite of table available inside - she was made to sit inside once but again was asked to step out soon thereafter - she was ready to order food but wasn't even given an option (with rude behaviour from the guard on duty outside). Second instance: the waiter who came to return the card post payment, lingered on shamelessly for tip - when questioned about the same, had the audacity to say the bill included 'service tax' n not 'service charge' indirectly emphasizing that he still deserved a tip n when refused, was quite grumpy about it rudely! Even the staff taking the order seemed like they are doing u a favor!! No doubt it can be one of the best places to eat at Park Street when it comes to food, but if u enter it expecting even a standard level of service, u will b in for a rude awakening! Just by suiting up n wearing uniforms doesn't make u fit for this industry if u don't know the basic courtesy of customer "service"!

This place doesn't need a review. It's older than me, wiser than me and of course famous than me. XD
I have been going there since my childhood, my dad has been going there since his teen, and my Dadu from...I don't know when.
It has become an integral part of Calcutta's rich heritage, which managed to survive the passage of time. The dining room is intimate, with white stucco walls, Tiffany-style lamps, soft lighting; The waiting staff look grand, with their sherwani suits, flamboyant headgear & pointed shoes - Everything still preserves the old world charm of the restaurant.

The menu is an eclectic mixture Continental and Indian dishes, especially tandoori fare.

üî∏The Chelo Kabab is a Persian delicacy where mutton and chicken kebab are served with salty butter flavoured rice topped with a fried egg, butter and a poached tomato. It's an absolute delicacy. So is Chicken Marrakesh.

üî∏The Prawn Cocktail is basically shrimp served in a cocktail of mayonnaise, tomato ketchup and a few herbs.

üî∏The House Special Chicken Steak Sizzler is served with chicken liver, sausages, potato wedges, veggies and a fried egg. I don't usually like chicken liver, but when it comes with the sizzler you can't help but love it! If you haven't tried it yet, go, try.

üî∏Beckty Meunier is batter fried fish served with white creamy sauce in such a way that the crunchiness of the batter is gone, it forms a rather even interesting texture. Along with the fish they serve spicy half potatoes ‚Äì which taste excellent as well.

üî∏Apart from these their Dum ki Raan, Fish Makhmali, Afgani Chicken are mind blowing as well.

But just so you know, the waiting stuff might not be as warm and welcoming as you expect them to be.
Most likely you'll HAVE to wait for a table for atleast 30mins, unless you are damn lucky.
They sometimes, actually a lot of times screw up the bill somehow, so, do check it before you pay.

Bon Appetit!

This place is located next to flury's & one of the posh areas in Kolkata , part street area. They live up to the expectations when you enter their restaurant . The ambience is great . The dim lighting for the dinners are perfectly set. Their chelo kebabs is one dish I can keep writing about forever. It's sufficient for one person . The chicken and the mutton in this dish taste delicious . The rice is served with butter cubes on it. Great dish !

I don't think any food enthusiast in Kolkata needs to be told about Peter Cat. It's one of those places who've maintained their reputation well in the food business and have continued to deliver excellent service over the years.

Went to Peter Cat on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and was expecting a crowd. Didn't have to wait for too long though. We ordered Half Sizzling Dum ki Raan and the famous Chelo Kebab. 

While the Dum ki Raan was mind-blowing, the Chelo Kebab seemed a little bland as compared to the last time I had it. 

We finished our meal off with an ice cream float, which was pretty delicious and hit the spot nicely. 

Overall, the service and the food were at par with the reputation of this place. Would visit again, needless to say.

I went along with my friends and we have to wait for around 45mins before getting the table. Once, we got the table we have ordered for 1 fish farah kabab nd 2 special chelo kabab. I would say the Peter Cat famous chelo kabab wasn't that great in taste. As the rice wasn't hot as the butter didn't melted properly, the mutton/ chicken pieces were too rosted. Overall, I didn't like the food much.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 2/5

This place is famous for its Chelo Kabab and I must say it didn't disappoint. Both the chicken and veg chelo kabab were great.¬†

The ambiance is good, possibly resembling mughal-esque looks.¬†

The only thing that didn't meet my expectation was the service, which was a bit slow. This has now become a trend in Kolkata when a restaurant becomes more and more popular.

This is an ideal place to have great food with family.

Absolutely one of the best place to dine and drink in kolkata. ¬†Yes they are best in chelo kebab. No doubt. Zomato's recommended dishes like beckty muniere, dum ki raan,chicken marakesh,fish makhmali kebab are absolute stunner without doubt. Beckty muniere (fish) just melts in your mouth. Just the right blend sauce and fish which gives a whole bite. Dum ki rann is a shredded spicy meat. Not a give fan though but liked this preparation. Another favourite was chicken marrakesh. Was a well made kebab with right smoked flavour. Overall very happy dining in PETER CAT.

What can I possibly say about Peter cat that hasn't been said in the myriad reviews given above? 

Peter Cat is one of the three legendary outlets of park street. The food here is mostly of the Indian and middle eastern cuisine. I'll mention items which I've eaten here the most

Tandoori broccoli - I am a hardcore non vegetarian, so if I'm suggesting a vegetarian dish, trust me, it'll be worth it. The size is huge, the tandoor is succulent and tasty, it's just amazing! 

Chello kebab - the non veg chello kebab, 6 pieces of soft, melt in the mouth chicken tikka, 2 pieces of melt in the mouth mutton seekh kebab, buttered rice with a sunny side up egg, if that doesn't make your mouth water, I honestly don't know what will. 

Fish in chefs special sauce with bread rolls - the perfect dish if what you're looking for sea food, I personally only take the chello kebab and occasionally make a friend take this dish so I can have a bite or two of this, it's the perfect crime. 

Meringue with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce - a legendary and classic dessert, just beat in mind that meringues are made from egg whites, so if you're a vegetarian you'll have to miss out on this.

Went to Peter Cat with a friend after ages. My friend reached first and was subjected to a barrage of questions namely how many people, when is he expected and then when I reached had to ask I guess five people for a Glass of water and a finger bowl which arrived after a good 10 minutes.
We ordered Chelo Kebabs  and was lukewarm to say the least . 
The indifferent attitude of the steward and the bearers guess made the food more insipid than what it was . Surely not visiting Peter Cat in a Hurry !!!!! Krishnakumar

I have absolutely to idea how food lovers in Kolkata give so much of hype to this restaurant. May be good for localites but definitely nothing special for visitors coming from Delhi. The food is good, but just good nothing enormously hyped out of it. People who ate outside kolkata, for example in Delhi places  like Gulati's are way ahead of this place. Presentation is sub standard, service is below average, food taste usual like any tikka or kabab, but the price is insanely overpriced. I ended up paying 1459/- for a dinner of 2 while ordering 2 chelo kababs, fish fingers, 1 naan and 1 bottled water. Starting my journey, first had to wait for more then 30 mins to enter the restaurant and another 39 mins to get the food, which made me wonder if i am about to get some out of the ordinary experience. However, upon entering the environmemt was just like any other old restaurant. The seating was normal, waiters were dull and lost. Being first time here even after asking for recommendations from my server, he seem to be not interested or willing to show me the picture what i heard in various articles and forums. Chelo kababs were good, but going with the price the quantity was not enough, it did not justify the price. I am a first time visitor here, n probably would not be visiting them anymore. There is nothing special about this place except tye chelo kababs to some extent where u get rice with butter, poached egg and one whole baked tomato (not grilled as they claim), minus these items its just any usual tikka and 2 sticks of kabab.

After withstanding an absurd amount of incessant mockery from my colleagues for not having visited Peter Cat, I finally gave in one day and thus started my journey to this fabled restaurant. Peter Cat has been around for more than 30 years now and despite that, it hasn't lost its sheen or vigour to serve its patrons. People flock to this place in numbers and that alone tells us about the charm this restaurant exudes.¬†

I tried their signature Chicken Steak sizzler, Chelo Kebab, and a Strawberry blossom to appease my taste buds. Unequivocally, their sizzler is a gem of a dish. Brilliant presentation, amazing taste, the perfect package. The Kebabs surprised me. I hadn't expected anything from the good ole' Kebabs but the sheer depth of the taste was overwhelming. Nicely done. The drink too was good, however, I wish that they keep more mocktails on their menu.¬†

The ambience inside was quite good. For a large place such as this, it was rather quiet when I visited it. The place at once resembles a modern restaurant while maintaining a sense of history.
I was satisfied by this restaurant. Contrary to my previous prejudices, this place was a nice eatery to have some quality food. A must visit place if you are in the city.

A restaurant which needs no introduction. We ordered chelo kebab, chicken steak sizzler and souffl√© of the day. The service was pretty fast. Quality wise they were fabulous. I don't need to explain about the taste of the chelo kebab and the sizzler, but the souffl√© needs a special mention. It was whipped to perfection with a creamy texture and coffee flavor, the basil on top just added. Great experience and explains why I keep visiting this place often.

MEAWO MUNCHING!

" The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
It isn't just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey--
All of them sensible everyday names."

I begin with a prelude with Eliot's famous poem on THE NAMING OF CATS... And out of this poem comes out Peter Cat, catwalking...
My first introduction to this place was an episode in our initial married years when my friend and life partner, a proud Xaverian and Professor of English Literature, insisted to bring me here on a Christmas Night. We had wine and beer but also a revelation named Chello Kabab. It was also for the first time, ten years back, when I understood what a sizzler is... A Sizzler is Love on Fire !

Well I dont know where to start really . It is one of those legendary restaurant where each and every bite of food is delightful, and each and every dish is special one way or another. They have an soothing ambience and very polite and friendly staff. Good hospitality even though we had to wait for couple of minutes as its very hard to get an seat even on a regular day. We ordered their extremely famous Chello Kabab and Chicken Steak Sizzler. Not the fastest service but cant really complain. The Chicken Sizzler was one of a kind and I can use all the synonym of the word tasty and still can't express how good it was. Chicken was tender and the vegetables were juicy. Hands down one of the best Chicken sizzler you can get in Kolkata . Now coming to the prominent Chello Kabab which I personally found very conventional. Don't get me wrong its not bad and probably better than any other restaurant can do but it doesn't blow your mind. Anyway this restaurant is definitely one of the top ones out there and gonna visit again and again ..

The food is extremely delicious and the ambiance and atmosphere adds to it. The best thing about this place is Kababs and Naan. I have visited more than once and would love to visit again. The only bad thing is that, due to high demands sometimes people have to wait outside the hotel for their turn to come. It may get improved by providing a rest room for the waiting people. Keep serving !

There are those who go to Peter Cat and there are those who go to Mocambo. I belong to the latter. The ambience at both are equally good. Peter Cat is usually more crowded and it is difficult to just walk in without waiting for a table. For those who keep going to Peter Cat, it is usually one if their favourite restaurants.

Despite, being a lifelong resident of Kolkata, this was my first visit to Peter cat. Ordered their famed chelo kebab, chicken steak sizzler, roasted chicken sizzler. Tbh, found their chelo kebab underwhelming, after all the hype. But the other 2 sizzlers were just fabulous. I especially loved the chicken steak, my sis preferred the other.

All in all, a lovely lunch. Ambience was average. On price point, as a resident of Mumbai, I might not be the correct judge of Kolkata food prices. For visitors from Mumbai, it's reasonably priced.

Peter Cat is undoubtedly one of Kolkata's must visit restaurants, atleast for me, after the first experience. We were a group of 4 people, planned a lunch during diwali, and as expected, we were greeted with a long queue. Surprisingly, it didn't take us long to get a table, thanks to the capacity of the place and efficient staffs. Now coming to the food, we ordered Chelo Kebab, Nawabi and Mutton Rogan Josh. Chelo kebab was awesome, so are the other ones. However, the quantity was a bit less, considering the festive rush, understandable. 
Definitely, a place to be on your checklist. ‚ò∫

And the food is obviously delicious. I've been here several times but have never eaten anything else other than the Chelo Kabab. They serve it the best and if you're in Park Street, go to this place and order a plate of Chelo Kabab. :D

Had been to this place after the pujas. This place I feel is over hyped. We ordered for the famous items , the mix sizzler and Chelo Kebab. Both the dishes were ok-ish. Nothing mind blowing or out of the world. The mix sizzler tasted like someone had put tomato puree on some curry of tandoor items and served as a sizzler.
The Chelo Kebab was pretty bland and the Seekh  kebebs served in the dish were not very soft and tasty.
Overall a very moderate experience.

I've been there 5 times and the sizzlers are amazing. Chicken steak with a plate of chello kebabs is my usual menu to go to!!  The service is amazing and pretty fast considering the no. If people!!!

Keep it up!!

The  place where you can get best Chelo kebabs and Sizzlers. We went there mainly for the Chelo kebabs, but Chicken Marrakesh,  Sizzlers was amazingly tasty as well. The ambience and service is good,  quantity  and quality is satisfying.  Thank you.  I shall recommend this place to my friends and family.  :)

First and foremost, the attitude of the staff is very bad. They are arrogant, rude, do not cooperate and are utterly unprofessional. I mean, such old people who don't have a sense of hospitality and etiquette are slowly drowning this historical place.¬†

First off, we ordered Tandoori Broccoli which was colder than a cucumber. When we told the waiter about it, he started making up stories(he didn't want to serve a fresh plate). After repeated requests, he took it back, saying we will be served a newly made batch. Turns out, when he came back, that it was the same serving we had been given before(I could see the displaced pieces and the gravy on the rim which had happened when we took some in our plates). The only difference was that it was not hotter than the surface of the sun i.e. it was merely microwaved. I was irritated and disgusted. We ordered Veg Chelo Kebab which was quite normal, nothing worthy of such an expensive and old place. The worst thing I ever had in my life came next - Veg Sizzler. Well, basically, it was boiled veggies dipped into a terrible marinade and fried, then covered into a terrible gravy and served over a sizzler plate. It was absolutely hideous to look and eating it was like eating prison food. When we asked them, they refused to cooperate and told that that's what they do. The staff was so rude and uncooperative that I immediately left the place.

Was here for a birthday party with colleagues. The only reason to come here would be to have the renowned chello kebab or the sizzlers. Both are extravagant to taste. Do take some drinks to diget the food. A good bottle of beer may do wonders . And please do try the desserts. The're superb. Tried tgem for the first time and loved them.

Peter Cat is a legend. Its hard
To a get a table here on most days. The food has remained high-quality for a very long time now. But given how Kolkata's god scene has erupted in recent years, places like this are kind of becoming a little boring. Perhaps they should reinvent their menu or have some festivals every now and then.

Whenever I had been to kolkata I made sure I visit this place and order their most famous dish chello kebabs....this time as well after a gap of 3 years I visited them..the dish was almost the same but the taste was missing though...honestly it wasn't that great the way it used to be earlier...not to say that it was bad...it's definitely on my must visit  list for any food lover who visits kolkata...great food....ambiance hasn't changed at all and good service...try to go a little earlier than the usual lunch and dinner time to save yourself from a looooonnngggg waiting queue

Peter Cat equals Love. This place doesn't really need a review for Calcuttans. I have friends who are not even from Kolkata talking about how they love chello kebab of Peter Cat. Butter rice, mutton steak, chicken Reshmi kebab. Chello kebab doesn't really get old. I love their chicken sizzler as well. And the grilled bhetki. And Strawberry crush smoothie. Peter Cat belongs to one of Kolkata's most precious restaurants for soul food. And you know why.

One of the most authentic dining areas in Kolkata. An ambience perfect for a blissful night. We ordered Chicken marakesh, chicken biriyani, some starters with aloo and a few drinks.

Chicken were perfect as told by the carnivores in my team. The aloo tandoori was good too. Pretty decent. Courteous staff.

No need to tell you that this place is famous for it's chello kebabs. And we all love it. I happen to visit the restaurant thrice this year and enjoyed the meal.  Along with chello kebab I have ordered tandoori chicken sizzler once which was amazing. I like spicy food and though this was mildly spicy I still liked it.  Another time I ordered nalli mutton which looked very delectable but sadly was not at all good.  This was the only disappointment.  As we don't prefer wasting food we ate it some how but I will never order this again.  Apart from this you will love the ambience.

Legendary defines this place!! This place is older than I am and still running housefull. Not for a single day have I seen this place out of business whatever the time of the day it might be! Even on a midweek evening, we had to wait for around thirty minutes for a table of three (they had given the estimation as forty five minutes though). 
Everyone knows about the craze behind sizzler and chelo kebab here but the MUST HAVE dish (appetiser) here has to be Prawn Cocktail!! That is sure to take one to the seventh heaven!!
As for the ambience and location, I just love this place! 
People say Peter Cat has deteriorated over time but I somehow overlook that every single time! Maybe that's true love!! :-D Whenever I'm in town, I try my best to make a visit here...

Happy dining!!

This place is legend sitting quietly on the corner of park Street and Middleton row. It is one of the best places in India to find the best continental and rare North Indian dishes. Apart from its sizzlers and tandoori items, the superb dish chelo kebab has originated from here. Even celebrities like Rahul Gandhi have dropped into this place for a platter of the complete delicious meal of chelo.

Veg Chelo Kebabs are the only reason I decided to wait for 1.5 hours to get a table on a Friday evening! The place is doing so well simply because of the food but unfortunately the staff outside doesn't seem to care about the customer and is quite rude. The only thing that keeps me going to the place is the chelo kebab while everything else in the vegetarian option is quite average.

1. Worth the wait.
2. Food that is exceptional in quality and taste. Sizzlers that actually tastes like sizzlers! Chello kebabs which were brilliant in taste and preparation. Try roast sizzlers and shimmers for sure. They also have an wide array of alcohol options so no worries with respect to that also.
3. This is a family bar and restaurant so you'll get the proper ambience you were looking for in a family fine dine. A big thumbs up for that.
4. Servers and services all are decent enough.
5. Only one con is the space is a little less like I went with my family and 6 people were there and we had to adjust within the seats. A bit short in space.
Otherwise a big thumbs up! :)

The legendary Peter Cat.Most of the people who are reading this review, must have already heard about this joint from friends/media, so what I'd like to write about today is: "Does it live up to the expectations?" The answer is mostly Yes, but there are aspects which can be improved. 

To start with, the ambiance doesn't have the plush and pomp of modern restaurants, but is pleasantly antique. There is a vibrant buzz of talkative Bongs as opposed to classical music and hushed tones, which is commonplace in places, such as these. I liked it!

The drinks however disappointed me. The cocktail spread was limited to say the least. Though the Whiskey sour and fruit cup we ordered, were decent in taste, they could have been much better!

As per diligent research, we ordered bekti muniere, chicken tikka kebab and fish makhmali kebab for starters. They were delicious. Period. 

You know, during Diwali,  you get a 500 bucks rocket firecracker because you have heard, how majestic it looks when it soars into the dark sky and explodes multiple times into flowery patterns of light!  Well the Chelo Kebab fizzled out a couple of feet into the air at best and left me wondering, whether people will believe when I tell them this!

Chicken Marrakesh, like Rahul Dravid in ODIs, pleasantly surprised with it's effort to prove it's authenticity. The meat was succulent, the sauces were vivacious and the helpings were generous.

We ordered the Peter Cat Special, and Meringue in choco sauce. The first one was an honest effort to make a fruit based layered ice cream. The Meringue( a biscuit) was far to hard and sticky to be enjoyable.

Overall, it was a fair outing but from an establishment as old and popular as Peter Cat, one would expect more consistency. It surely has the potential to be far better than this!

First restaurant I visited in Kolkata on my first visit to the city. Located in the Park Street Area, this restaurant is bustling with customers at any time of the day. So we had to wait for almost 30 minutes to get a table and it was worth it. We visited this restaurant only to have the famous "Chelo Kebab". The Chelo Kebab is a full meal in itself and consists of 2 Seekh Kebabs, a generous portion of Chickeb Tikka, Rice, Fried Egg, Butter and Vegetables. The Chicken Tikka is really creamy and juicy and the Seekh Kebabs ate also very flavorful.
The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing and the service is quick. The staff is experienced and cooperative. I will definitely visit this place again on my next trip to Kolkata

I personally felt that the famous Chelo kebab(grilled seek & boti kebab alternated with vegetables along with fried rice topped with a half fried egg) missed the essence of a wet gravy add on which could have balanced the dryness of the dish and thus could have uplifted the overall punch that it would have provided. While the house special sizzler was delicious with the mix of chicken livers, chicken sausages and chicken streak cooked with the sizzler sauce and served with bread & butter cubes added a good flavour to the yummy dish. Talking Peter cat,  it had a excellent ambience with unparalleled service, though we had to wait for almost 30mins to grab a table for two due to heavy rush. Overall I would rate the taste to be average.

Its offcourse a legendary restaurant with a waiting queue of minimum of 30 people outside on fridays saturdays and sundays.
Luckily have managed to get seats. Been here a lot of times but never thought of writing a review. I guess for some places reviews do not work and Peter cat is One such.¬†
They are famous for their mouth watering sizzlers and their Chelo Kabab.
For me yes the chelo Kabab is a favourite but people who do not like spicy food should not try it because it the kababs are spicy. Otherwise it is truly impressive.

Other than that we ordered for chicken bharta and tandoori roti. Those were also delicious.¬†
It is a place people would visit again and again.

Peter Cat, a legend in itself. Though one has to wait for a long time before getting a seat, be it on any day, the wait is worth it. The restaurant is very spacious. The dim lighting and the red lamp shades hanging on top of each table adds a whole new level of excitement to one's meal. The seating arranement is very comfortable and elite. The service is very good and the staff is always ready to sort out any problem that you might face while in there. The quality of food has remained excellent over these years and i have been here numerous times. I always go back to indulge in their filling chelo kebab. The kebabs are prepared to perfection. The tandoori mixed grill should be tried by all meat lovers, but the chicken was a bit tough the last time i visited Peter Cat. the fried beckti with tartar sauce is also delicious. This place is a must visit if one is in Kolkata and wants to try legendary food.

I always found dining in Peter Cat to be an accomplishment of sorts because of all the hype and popularity of this place. It's legendary indeed! I haven't experimented very much with the menu items here, hence have stuck to having the chello kebab and the house special or chicken sizzler. There is a reason why these dishes are so famous...it's because of their sheer deliciousness...!! The chicken is always tasty and soft. The other items on your plate like the veggies,buttered rice etc are also well cooked. I really like the ambience with the dimly lit lamps which cover the restaurant in a warm orange tint. The service doesn't lag much even though the place is filled with diners very often :-)

We had reached the place just in time to avoid a queue. We were seated at the ground floor and the place has a very afghani charm about it with the dressed up waiters and table decoration, lights etc. Very charming.The food is "Wallah". We had ordered for House Special sizzlers and THE Chelo Kababs. Amazing food! You know there are certain kinds of food that bring peace to your mind and soul, the sight of it and the whole table goes quiet because all you want to do is dig in and eat. Just that kind of food. Quality, quantity no complaints. Price may be slightly high but its worth it. The only drawback is, after having a hearty meal you might want to sit back and relax because while eating you did not realize how much you have eaten but you can not do that since there is a queue waiting outside this small yet cozy place to indulge in their tasty treats.

For me, this restaurant has lived up to its reputation as one of the topnotch eating places in the city, minus the wait for an excruciating 1.5 hours. It was Nobomi, so that's forgivable.

What we ordered: Prawn Cocktail, Chelo Kebab, House Special Sizzler

When the Prawn Cocktail arrived, we were horrified by the amount served. The dish would fill a teacup, that's about it. But it's tasty, like, really. The House Special Sizzler was also lip-smacking, served with two tandoori chicken breasts, two sausages, omelette, potatoes and salad. But the taste that would linger in your mouth is the Chelo Kebab, Peter Cat's specialty. Especially the buttered rice - it's to die for!

Ambience: A dark space with minimal lighting and bright lanterns hanging above every table - you won't be disappointed.

Staff: They are always at your service, courteous and quick. You'll hardly be kept waiting once you're at your table.

Tasty food. Like they say "old is gold". This veteran restaurant has maintained a very high standard of food. 

They never disappoint you in terms of quality and flavour of the dishes served. It still has the old world charm in its menu which is a welcome change against other restaurants that are competing in the market with new dishes. 
Ordered my favourites today, cream of sweet corn and chicken soup, chicken bharta ,peas polao and butter naan. 

NO OTHER restaurant makes chicken bharta like Peter Cat does. Absolutely heavenly. Also their creamy soups are to die for. 
My constant when it comes to dining out.

Well finally gave a visit to the historic and heard-about-it-a-lot Peter Cat. I went in the evening around 6pm and didnt have to wait for a table. Staff behaviour was normal. It was just formal and okay. Not some kind of great courteousness and hospitality. Coming to the food.. We ordered the famous Chelo Kebab and Half Sizzled Mutton Dum ki Raan. I felt Chelo kebab is a much overhyped menu! Not kinda something unearthly n heavenly taste dat it should be hyped so much about! .. Dum ki raan was too.. okay.. salt was above d margin though the mutton was tender and soft. The Rs 12 glass bottle of thumps up costs Rs 70 here including d tax. Ironical fact is they bring the bottle itself n place it on ur table. I orderred a brownie with ice cream too. It was good .. again.. as usual as u get else where. Total bill of the above items was 1309 including tax. Summary- GOOD but of course OVERHYPED and OVERPRICED. Still a must visit for once .. for d ambience.. for the name.. and to stop repenting when others say "Tui peter cat e jashni? Seki re! "

After a long time we had a lovely lunch at Peter Cat with Chicken Steak Sizzler and Chelo Kebab. Nothing but Tuty Fruity, was a justified dessert that complemented the lunch as a conclusion. However the quantity of rice was reduced in Chelo Kebab than what I had previously. The wait outside can be managed a bit more conveniently. Keep up the good job, Peter Cat.

An icon of the city, situated on an iconic street. Peter Cat is well known among the food lovers of this city and beyond. They are most famous for their Chemo Kababs. There is no other place known for their one specialty than this gem. So much so that people do not even look at their menu and just order for their Chemo Kababs. And why not, it is mouth watering and absolutely delish. Having said that, they must focus on other parts of their menu and service and do something about the d√©cor which has lived it's life.

Review: Peter Cat

Location - 4.5/5
Situated at Park Street, finding it is very easy. Only problem is the one-way system of the area, that may leave you confused about when to enter from which direction, if you are not well-versed with the traffic system of the area. Fairly easy to reach via metro/ surface transport, being located at central part of the city.

Facilities - 2/5
Well, parking can be a mess in that part of Kolkata, not only during weekends, but on weekdays too. Expect to walk about 500 meters after parking unless you get lucky to find a nearby spot to park. No dedicated facility of takeaway.

Ambiance - 3.5/5
The feeling of the old calcutta will touch you once you enter. The smooth, dim lights are ideal for a romantic evening to old friends gatherings. Sitting arrangements does not have much of variations, but comfortable none the less.

Food & Drinks - 4/5
Costly, but tasty - in a nutshell. No, you won't find anything cheap in this place, and a dinner for to even without drinks may cost you north of Rs. 1000. But, Chelo kababs, both veg & non-veg are very tasty. Same goes with the sizzlers. All major drinks are also available. Your Kolkata food trip won't be complete without this restaurant.

Service - 1/5
Well, mostly they are polite, but I find them too arrogant in the matter of serving alcohol. One of my junior (aged above 21) forgot her id proof (who really carries one when going for a party?), they didn't allow her to have a drink, even when I was willing to personally certify her age being a doctor (what should they really want beyond that?). Moreover they were playing moral police when someone offered her a sip from his drink. Really?!

Overall - 3/5
One thing, if you are throwing a party at this place ask everyone to bring their id card with age proof (Seriously, these guys are pretty awful in this matter) Food & drinks are fine, albeit with a premium they charge, that said not a cheap place to eat by any means. Some dishes they offer are worth having.

My all time favorite in Kolkata. A place which truly meets all the foodies' expectations. Peter Cat has always been a very busy restaurant because there are so many people who love the food here. Their Chelo kababs, sizzlers, biriyani..everything is just mouth watering. Highly recommended for people who are in the city and also for people who are new to Kolkata. A place where you should definitely visit.

Its a food heaven for any non-vegetarian. If you are in Kolkata visiting this food-outlet is a must thing.
Ambience :Waiting in the queue for over an hour will be worth it as soon as you enter the place. The smell of the food and the film lights and the old-world charm will mesmerise your hungry soul. The waiters are courteous. And they were all dressed in proper Bengali attire.
Food : They are excellent at the craft of making food. The foods are finger licking good there.
For our starter we ordered
Sikar- a mutton based bonless kabab which was highly tender and testy.
For main course we ordered their signature dish ‚Ä¢"Chello - Kabab" which tasted divine.
‚Ä¢Chicken biriyani- Okay. Probably you should not be here to have biriyani any time. Its only for the biriyani the scale got down to 4.0 .
‚Ä¢ Baked fish - an okayish dish.
‚Ä¢ Chicken steak kabab - its their house special sizzler. Highly recommended.
We ended our lunch with a chocolate dessert.
Overall its a posh dine area with sophisticated ambience. And each bite is delightful, provided you have enough patience to wait in the queue.

This is one of the must visit restaurants in Kolkata. ¬†Have always been there for the Chelo kabab or the sizzlers and it tastes the same over the years. The restaurant is dimly lit and perfect for a nice dinner with family or a date.¬†The only downsides I can think of are that the cocktails are not upto the mark and have struck themselves to the old classics.

We had gone for lunch. Meeting up with friends after a long time. Peter cat we thought was the ideal place. This place was our favourite haunt years back. Firstly we  had to wait for over a hour but were excited to taste the Chelo kebab, which I must say was a total disappointment. The chicken kebab was hard and stale. The rice served cold. Onions with vinegar and pickle  i don't think has been replaced for months. Staff snooty and care a hang attitude. I would never like to visit the place again and believe me it's really not worth the wait.

Once you enter, the ambience takes you to some different generation all together, where the waiters are wearing quite unique uniform which will definitely catch your attention. To begin with we ordered Strawberry blossom, which was very ok, and not to be recommended at all. Next we ordered Chelo kebab, no point for guessing, as it‚Äôs totally a must. A dish which was a combination of starter and main course, it has a bed of rice, with a half fry on top, some rare herbs on the sides, mutton kebabs on one side and nicely soft cooked chicken pieces on the other. It‚Äôs enough to fill one person‚Äôs stomach and we ordered Dum-ki-Raan, entire piece of mutton slow cooked. I usually don‚Äôt prefer mutton outside but I must say they had cooked it to perfection. The bread was served with good amount of butter cubes. Over-all it‚Äôs totally a must visit, to try different yet unique set up and food.

If you are a Kolkatan, and you haven't visited Peter Cat, you need a break. For once you must have wondered the reason behind the unprecedentedly large gathering just behind the Music World, have you? If you have, then let me tell you, that's the most auspicious crowd in town because they are eyeing the BEST EVER chelo kebabs and sizzlers in town. Ages have gone by, things have altered itself to one's liking, but the Peter Cat's appeal has increased manifold. People of all age limits flock out here and so do we, the bunch of teenagers who are dragged like a magnet, every year during the Christmas!

My first time experience was really good! Went for a lunch date and the food served was so delicious. They didnot make me wait for even 30mins like the other restaurants. Within 20mins my food was served.The behaviour of the manager and the staff was soo good and polite instead of the bulk amount of customers they were handling.

As we know peter cat is famous for it's delicious "Chelo kebeb " . It was my first experience with the food and it left me and my gf with licking fingers .
Chocolate ice cream served was also good and fresh.
The inside apperance is also very good.

A good place to hang out with family, friends and near n dear ones. üëç That's why i gave it 5points.

Peter cat is one of my favourite restaurants in the city, not just because of the food but because it always bails you out whenever you cannot decide where to eat out.
I've never managed to enter without having to wait in a queue. Its packed even at 7 pm. They do make reservations so the only option you have is to reach early.

The favourite here would definitely be the chelo kabab but sizzlers are also great.
The place is nig enough wit 2 floors and is very dimly lit, just adding to the ambience.
A meal for 2 would come to about rs. 700.

One of the best places in Park street area and that is enough for you to try this place once. The food is at par with the best in Kolkata and in some aspects this joint is setting goals for other restaurants to follow. Just order the Chelo Kabab if it's your first time there it is worth every penny.

Coming from Delhi. Heard a lot about Peter Cat. Finally got to visit it and trust me it exceeded my expectations. I ordered Grilled Fish sizzler and Chelo Kebabs with Chilled Beer (which they served in Mugs which felt like you're drinking ale from Lord of the rings) and it was heaven in my mouth. The ambience of this place took me 20 years back which made it very different.

Planning to have another MASSIVE meal at Peter Cat before I leave for New Delhi.

The atmosphere is very calm and soothing. Dim lights and a quiet, serene atmosphere will greet you as soon as you walk through the doors. Totally recommend... keep it up Petercat.

We came down from Delhi for a little puja shopping in Kolkata and had Peter cat in mind as we had heard so highly of the place. Well;, after what happened, I will never recommend this place to anyone. Coming back to the story - The hopes were shattered when we tasted the food. It was poor. The butter naans were heavy and hard and the prawn was rubbery. The Chelo Kabab was ok... To add to the agony we found a long hair in the pickle bowl. When we reported the issue, the waiting staff hurriedly took the bowl and said these : "must be a lady customer's hair". I found this extremely insulting as I hope no customer goes with the intention of putting hair in the food. He didn't even apologize. ¬†A simple "sorry" could have solved the problem. Oh and he never replaced the pickle bowl. These guys are extremely unprofessional and the waiters were openly talking about which customer will give tips and which others won't. Over rated place. Even the street food vendors I hope will have better decency and their food too will taste better than Peter cat. The only good part was my company --- My hubby, with whom i can feel great even in a bad environment.

It is a very famous restaurant in park street which my family and I have been visiting for atleast a decade now. The food is great. They are known for its sizzlers and chelo kababs. I personally prefer the sizzler especially the sound of it when it is coming to you. It's the happiest moment for a foodie. You will not find such great chelo or sizzler anywhere else in the whole of kolkata. One cannot complain about anything when it comes to their food.
 The ambience is great. Park street is a posh area so you expect them to cater to a certain kind of crowd. They are judgmental if you do not fit that category and in that casethe waiters could become extremely rude.
The thing is that because it is such a big high-fi place the waiters have a lot of attitude and aren't helpful. They aren't friendly and are definitely snobbish.

Finally Peter Cat
Waited for ages to write down this one and man i have not been dissapointed


It certainly is legendary!!!

Went oldschool as we did not experiment much and went for the chelo kebab and the house special sizzler

Nothing much to say
Extra brownie points for the portions of butter and the bread that they served

Was brilliant
Tender and soft

The chicken was perfect and tenderly cooked and so were the sausages and the liver
Going to remember this for a long long long time

Ambiance is very good.
Food is awesome, specially the Vanilla Ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. In my opinion their chocolate sauce is the best in Kolkata And of of course the sizzler and their trademark dish ¬†Chelo Kabab.¬†
Staffs are very nice.¬†
One thing I must add. Please reach half hour ahead before your schedule dinner time, since you are bound to wait there.

The place is a must visit if you want to experience Kolkata..no I don't say this, I was told. With a lot of enthusiasm I waited outside the always-waiting-is-on restaurant. Finally when I entered, the smell of the food, the dim lighting made me feel I was going to have an experience if it's kind. Couldn't wait to get started
The tandoori aloo I ordered for Starters was very nice, however whatever followed - Dal Makhani, Paneer tikka masala, Tandoori roti, Laccha paratha were all what I would say Average or little below. The paneer vegetable was too dry, no spices to justify it as paneer tikka masala.. laccha paratha was white, thick, heavy and not tasteful. Dal Makhani was a sheer let down. 
The prices are low and total bill was below what I had expected. Other than taste of the food, other let downs for me were-
1. Choice of Cocktails is hardly there. No Mojito,Caprioshka.. they call mixing just vodka and pineapple juice as a cocktail üòû
2. The staff is snooty and not warm at all.. I tried asking for a plug point to charge my phone for few mins as I was a visitor in the city and phone battery had died completely. To this the manager coldly refused and said they didn't allow phone charging. The small pan shop outside the restaurant allowed me to charge my phone so I could call for Uber. I was aghast at this cold attitude of the staff especially with someone who is a tourist.

I am so amazed at myself for reviewing Peter Cat after so long. I have been to this place innumerable times and it has never failed to lessen my intent to visit it again. Ofcourse we all know about their famous C.kebabs but for once lets just take a minute to appreciate the fragrance of heritage that Peter Cat emmanates of Calcutta. From The waiters decked most quintessentially to the Onion pickle that they serve- everything is so sorted albeit perfect. Calcutta is known for its warmth and this place apart from being an essential part of the heritage itself most loyally lives up to that spirit. This review more than been a critique of food was a reminder to the gourmets of the age of gem of Calcutta.

Visited peter cat today. We ordered the famous chelo kebab , chicken steak sizzler and strawberry milkshake and lime soda. 
I dont understand the hype over the chelo kebab. It was just normal. I didnt find anything unique. Yes the kebabs were good. The sheekh was okayish and the rice was average. Overall the chelo kebab was avaerage. The chicken steak sizzler was good. It had this sweet and sout taste which was appealing enough. I wished it was more spicy but enjoyed the chicken steak. Overall an average experience at Peter Cat.

Well, obviously this is on of the most popular and vintage restaurants in Kolkata and I have had numerous outings here. But the reason I'm reviewing is, most of the feedbacks are regarding their conti dishes such as chello kebab.. But guys, their dry chilli chicken is one of the best.. Don't miss it.. Fish makhmali kebab is also yummy.. In the main course, I like mutton nawabi..
Well only bit of disappointment is staff's behaviour (few, not all) and their inflated queue outside even though vacant spaces are there inside.

Chelo Kebab is the mostly ordered food item here. But I mostly prefer House special that is chicken steak. And prawn cocktail as the starter. N do not forget to try on the desserts. ‚ù§

We had some work near Park Street and then visited Peter cat. We had to wait for 45mins since it was on a Saturday. We had ordered chilly babycorn, chelo kebab and chicken steak sizzler. Food was awesome and also the ppl are courteous.. Worth the price!!

Since I went here on a Saturday night, didn't get a chance to sit in the restaurant and have the food there. We decided to take a parcel. Obviously we took their famous chello kebabs. The food was too tasty and we enjoyed every bite eating it at home. Ill expand my review once I get to go to this place and eat there. üòä

If your food won't serve with a smile it's hard to digest. Yes!!  the experience m going to share is pathetic.First I call the management for the reservation and they replied it's first come first serve. Great!!! then me with my company reach there somewhere around 7.30 pm. Fortunately we got two seats. No wait... there were more seats I requested them to give a table in first floor instead of the reception front seat. Sorry!!!  There's no vacant seats. Ok. Then take the order! No complaints for their signature dish #chelokabab. It was exceptionally good. We ordered fruit cup and strawberry appetizer. Very bad in taste. A suggestion to avoid them in your order.Then asked a beer and chicken steak sizzler. Shit!!! I found potatoes along with two chicken steak. Horrible!! The person who took the order And the service people have serious attitude problem.
I am pretty much disappointed with this legendary outlet.

There's absolutely no doubt about Peter Cat's credibility. I was there just two days back with my friends from outside the city and even they really liked the place. 
Chelo Kebabs are the best and an absolute must!

Ofcourse Peter cat is one of the oldest restaurants in park street, but it's no more one of the best. We ordered two grilled chicken sizzlers, one chelo kabab, two naan and some chicken gravy. The chelo kabab was soft but bland. Chicken sizzler was dripping of soy sauce. Naan was good, and the...

I have been to place quite a few times. I went here after a long time. The best thing of this place is the hospitality. The decor is equally beautiful to encourage to write a good review about this place. Lastly as far as the food is concerned like everytime I ordered chello kabab and sizzlers. I was quite sure that they never gonna disappoint me and they didn't. One important point "you don't have to bother about your attire before going to this place." This is one of the important thing now a days.üòú I would suggest everyone if they are searching for quality dining must visit this place atleast once. üòä

Yet another of the old, classic restaurants of Park Street, Peter Cat is mainly a place for Non Vegetarians. Well, I may be wrong but I've heard veggies not being too satisfied with this place. But nonetheless, for Non-Veggies, there are a wide range of options and most of them are just great!! The Afghani Chicken they make is just wow!! The Chicken Chello Kebab was also decent. I had enjoyed all of our order. Simple interiors, nothing flashy about it. Each table has got its own lamp hung over it, dimly lighting the place. Overall, a decent place to visit if you're mainly in for food and too much not into decor, interiors, themed places and stuff!

One of the oldest and most elite places to eat in the city- Peter Cat hosts a relatively small but interesting variety of dishes to offer. The drinks served here are amazing and one would be a loser if they don't have their cocktails. The Peter Cat cooler tastes funny and you've been warned.
The vintage ambience will set you in with a warm and cozy feeling and you'll have a great time here no matter if you're alone or in a group. Although amazing I won't recommend you to bring your date here. Not exactly a romantic place. The service here is okay. Nothing great! Being one of the posh restaurants in the city you'd have to write your name and wait in a que, unless you're born lucky, before they take you to your table. And the waiting time varies from 15mins to even hours.
Chello Kebab(both mutton and chicken) is their signature dish and tastes heavenly. Another great option for main course is Shah Nauz. You can start with Dum ki Raan and Fish Makhmali. The quantity they serve is a lot for a normal person so don't feed yourself much on appetizers. If you've never visited here, you haven't been much around the beautiful city of Kolkata.

This a very old and famous restro in kolkata .Park street area.
Pros

Inexpensive.

Convenient central location.

Serves excellent continental and Indian food.

Unique atmosphere.

Fascinating history.

Cons

Not a lot of space. Feels cramped when it gets busy.

Phone reservations are not accepted.

Extremely popular, so expect to wait for a table during peak times (especially on weekends and holidays). It can take up to an hour, although 30 minutes is more common.

When I visited Kolkata, the first recommendation I got was to try Chelo Kabab at Peter Cat. The restaurant was packed when I got there, and I had to sit by the door because of which I got a blast of hot air whenever the door was opened. But after sometime I was ok because I got my chelo kabab which was delicious, filling. Worth eating.

Ambience is fine for family dinner but din liked their food so mch. And yes yaha laashe ghumti hai staff k naam par,Very boring unpleasant staff.. it seems the staff is not happy with their job or may b with their customers. Their famous dish Chelo kebabs r nothing but chicken and mutton starters served together on a single plate. Even tried their sizzler but i wont call it a sizzler as i have had tremendous variety of authentic sizzlers in mumbai so what they served here was nothing lik sizzler to me. Taste was ok lik grilled chicken saute in garlic mushroom sauce.

Probably most people in the city of Joy who love food have been to this place at least once. Such is the reputation of Peter Cat, a true legend it is. Honestly speaking, the amount of time one has to spend while waiting in the queue, is completely worth it. So let's speak of the dish almost as famous as Sourav Ganguly over here.... the Chello Kebab. See, others have tried and tested with chello kebab. But no one comes even miles close to the genuine one over here. The aroma, the texture, the mix of flavours in your mouth are enough to give you instant joy. Cooked to perfection, the rice, butter, the meat complement each other exquisitely. An then, if you haven't had the house special sizzler, well then you've missed something really special. Also try the chicken Irani Kebab. Each bite is delightful. A place definitely worth a visit. If you have the patience to wait in the queue, just go for it

Well I visited the so called best flooding place on Sunday 18th September 16. Waiting was okay till justifiable , but on the serial name list they were allowing on the basis of the number of people on order first. That is also understandable, as they best match would be to aloting as per the table size. Next comes the order , it took them freaking 1:15 hours to meet the normal order of Kashmiri Biriyani and other. Best would have been to allow people get their waiting not a bitter taste!

This used to be one of my favourite restaurant in Kolkata. But in my last two visits I am utterly disappointed with the poor service. Chicken tikka kabab was not so good. And they took over an hour to deliver chicken cold salad. When we ordered one cold coffee with creme,the person who was taking the order told us he didn't know about that,later he remembered that thats in their menu card. Staffs are very rude. Really disappointed with this kind of thing in a reputed restaurant like Peter Cat.

This is my first ever review in zomato. As I started exploring different restaurants in Kolkata, I finally made it to the famous Peter Cat which is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. It has polite and dim light ambience which is great. Talking about the food ahh.... I ordered a chello kebab which was extremely delicious and for dessert i order Peter Cat special which was beautifully decorated with vanilla and chocolate ice cream mixed with choco chips, fruits and wafers almost similar to tooty fruity ice cream.. But the taste was good. I enjoyed the dishes and ended up with a sip of beer.. It was nice i would like to visit the place again...

On a cloudy late afternoon, me and my friend reached here hungry, in search of tasty yummy food. And good luck on us.. no waiting queue. A delicious haven for the foodies of Kolkata. We ordered a mango drink, chicken chelo kabab, and a Mutton chelo kabab. And it comes with their signature style of a sunny omelette on the top, butter melting in the rice and the kababs. Yummy, yummy and yummy! We were full, the ambience was so soft, dim lighting added to the mood. 
Would love to visit again.

I had heard alot of this place and finally got a chance to dine in yesterday.Well first to say that a lot of hype has been created around the legendry CHELO kebab. Well those who have been to places like delhi n other northern parts would agree with me that the kebab were not as good as they claim to be.firstly they were little burnt and secondly were cold from inside as if somone has micowaved them and served. The ambience was ok . Also tried their Fried Betcky .I would give it  3/5. Overall i would give 2.5 / 5 as i have been to many places  n trust me they are far more better . But it is  worth one time visit.

Honestly speaking I just went with my friends once in this restaurant at park street and our motto was only chelo kebab... So i won't be able to review about other food items but based on chelo kebab I wl definitely give Peter cat 4.5/5...we tasted Mutton as well normal chilo kebab (the one which have both mutton and chicken kebab).. Both the dishes were delicious and kebabs were mouth-watering. Very well prepared.. Apart from that overall restaurant was good and the behaviour of the waiters was also good.  Also there wasn't much delay for the food to come after giving the order (except festive seasons like pujas etc). But one problem is during weekend one should come bit early else he or she wl have to wait in a long queue.. We made that mistake and hence were in a line after 21. Apart from these everything looked fine to me..

Words cannot describe the delicious-ness of the food served here. The most popular dishes of this restaurant include Chelo kebabs and Steak sizzlers. And vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce acts as the icing on the cake. The soups here are also amazing and served fresh and hot. Though the ambience has been consistent since like it's inception, and I feel it could have done away with some minor renovations. Nevertheless, the food quality compensates for it.
P.S.: In case you plan to go on weekends for lunch or dinner during peak hours, be prepared to wait in the que for a couple of hours. The management here does not take reservations and follows strictly a first come first serve basis.

the management sucks.
i went there yesterday (17th sept 16) with my wife n one of my friend who was pregnant.
we were told tht the waiting time would be around 20 mins.
We politely asked the queue manager Sonu Kumar, of they could provide a chair to sit just for our friend who was pregnant. Mr.Sonu replied initially that the chairs were not empty and he was sorry for that.
but we saw that not 1 but 3-4 chairs were vacant !
after a while we asked again but then we were shocked to hear from him that He is not allowed by the management to provide a chair even for pregnant women !
shame on such inhumans !

i loved peter cat foods but i pledge never ever to go or to order from such heartless people.

Peter Cat Reveiw (We dont care for Pregnant Women)
--------------------

Few days ago, there was a lot of furore over how a driver was not allowed by the "Oldest Fine Dining Restaurant of Kolkata"

I was really annoyed by that and wondered how could THEY!!

Our group was a bit sceptical of getting a table at Peter Cat on a Saturday evening..but still tried our luck anyway considering it was 10.15pm on 17th September, 2016. The people outside were around 10 or 12 and the person managing the waiting patrons (Mr. Sonu Kumar) said it would take 20 mins tops.

I requested to provide the table a bit faster as a pregnant friend was within our group. He said with a reassuring smile "please wait and I will call your name soon"

After 10 mins I requested for a spare chair to be provided for the pregnant lady, Mr. Sonu Kumar said "No chairs are available".

For a moment I thought he was blind and I insisted that there were two tables occupied by only 1 person at each table (See Pic below) and a chair could be provided..

Sonu kumar, replied "no Sir we cant give as per Management Rules."

I personally do not know the Management of Peter Cat, but in which book it is written that "Thou shalt not provide a chair to a lady in need"

We were patiently waiting for our turn, and I only requested for a spare chair for the pregnant lady as it was over 20 mins she was standing. Last time I checked, Customer Service and satisfaction was utmost and the only way to keep the customers coming back.

After a good 25 mins had gone by, few of us started to lose patience at Mr. Sonu Kumar's rhetorical answers of waiting time and not being able to provide a chair for the Pregnant Lady, and so we raised our voices. We demanded the available chair to be provided. At this juncture Sonu Kumar felt the heat but in reply his only stand was

"Sorry sir the management doesnt allow a chair for pregnant lady"

This moron and staff like him provide a bad name and leave a bad taste. Frankly there are restaurants like Barbeque, Flury's and Hakunama Tata, which are more than considerate for such a demand.

For Instance another friend of mine who went to Flury's during her pregnancy was sitting outside those iconic pillars of Flury's. The Manager upon seeing a pregnant lady wait outside his restaurant for a table, immediately provided a chair and said "Madam,you should have told us the moment you came here. Why should you wait outside". I had observed a similar instance at Barbeque restaurant as well.

This talks about the human connect and talks volumes and creates a lasting brand inpression.

Today our group felt that 'These Restaurants' really do not bother for customer staisfaction and all they care about is Money..

We were more than happy to spend our 8 grands at the other eatery nearby which catered to our special need.

Thank you Peter Car Management, for showing what 'Fine Dining' means

P.S. The Management at Peter Cat lives under a rock, which is oblivious to the impact of Social Media.

It's been ages since I have been here so I'm going to do this review based on the last time I came over here.

This is one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata, situated in the heart of Park Street. This is one of those place in kolkata where u hv to eat without eating over here ur food journey in Kolkata is incomplete.

The ambiance of the place and the staff's are good, the food was also good they're the pioneer's of Chelo kebab (original) in Kolkata so that is a must & another item I liked was Beckti Meunier which is featured in Chef's seafood specialities.

The famous legendary restaurant in the Park Street area. Am writing the review for the first time but I am visiting this place from last 6 years.
So as usual was in queue but it was ok to wait to have some good food. The ambience was nice with soothing lights and comforting couch to dine in.
For starter we ordered ‚Ä¢Farah - soft tender fish prepared as kebab. The onion rings were mixed up with some tangy sauce like thing. As a whole it was okayish.
For main we had ‚Ä¢Chelo Kebab - chicken Chelo kebab the famous dish. No introduction is needed. Cooked perfectly. I never got bored to have this dish over and over again. Including my table four tables in a row all had the same Chelo kebab :)
‚Ä¢ Chicken Marrakesh - chicken and mutton kebabs with the sausages and rice. More or less same as Chelo kebab but the egg poch was missing. Buttery rice and the tender kebab pieces. Just awesome...
The service was the same good as it was.

My brother and me went here one rainy afternoon in order to try out the famous Chelo Kebab. Had heard a lot about this place (mostly good things), so we had high hopes, but were sadly disappointed.

There was quite a crowd at the entrance when we arrived, so we were not surprised to hear it would take about 20 minutes to get a table. Not wanting to wait right in front of the door, we stepped off to the side of the portico, and returned about 5-7 minutes later. The guy at the door announced in an irritated voice that he had already called for us once! We were finally seated 2-3 minutes later and ordered our food.

Food arrived quite late, which was expected in such a busy joint. Surprisingly, the famous Chelo Kebab was almost cold when served. However we said nothing and concentrated on the food. Halfway through, the server asked if we would need anything else. We replied that we would decide after finishing. Strangely, the guy returned twice in the next 15 minutes with the same query. It seemed as if they were trying to make us leave! We indicated we would decide and call him. Not sure how the guy interpreted this, but the next moment, we see a bill on our table. I called the server for an explanation, he apologized and took away the bill, but by then, we were more than ready to leave.

So basically, food is OK, ambiance is OK, service is complete shit. Overall, not a good experience and certainly not one that I would be repeating in the near future.

'If I am born a human again, I pray to thee, allow me to savour the nectors of Kolkatan Delight'. Peter Cat gives you a reason to live longer. They are such good at the craft of making food that it seems like a romantic poetry. The assorted platter is the USP. the place has weathered the testing times since the British Era and thus is heartening to see the standards still maintained. The entire menu is worth trying and prices to die for. A stupendous place for satiating hunger.

Peter cat is one of those legendary restaurants situated in the heart of Park street. The ambiance is elegant and aristrocat. The restaurant is divided into two floors. And the interiors are simple but extremely elegant. Dim lighting and soft music brings out the essence of this place. The staffs can be a bit more polite and friendly. Coming to the food which is the  highlight of this place, the food is extremely delicious. Especially the chelo kebab, it is perfect. The buttery soft kebabs just melts in your mouth. Not at all high priced this place is a must visit for everyone.:)

The entire package of butter rice, chicken and mutton kebab makes it up to its reputation! On a side note, drink less, eat more here!

Absolute Value for Money!

P.S.: Either make a reservation or be there before 30 mins ahead your plan. Place is pretty crowded!

------Peter Cat------ Name is enough for this legendary restaurant. I don't have to give a intro for this place.
‚óèLocation: Heart of the park street, opposite to the KFC outlet behind Au Bon Pain.

‚óèAmbiance: Decoration is very soothing and love the ambiance. Seating arrangements is divided between two floors.

‚ñ†We normally get prepared for the menu before going to the restaurant but that day we suddenly went there so our server helped us a lot.

‚óèDrinks: Strawberry Blossom was very good. Normally it was a simple milkshake but tasted slightly different which made that special. 
Fruit Cup is another drink we had on that evening. It was very good.

‚óèStarters: We ordered "Sikar" which was basically a mutton based boneless kebab. It was juicy, tender and tasty..
Another Kebab we had was "Fish Afghani", that kebab  was extremely good.. I can feel the taste in my taste buds while writing this review. 

‚óèFood: We ordered The Famous "Chelo Kebab". "EXCELLENT" is the only word which can describe it's taste.

Chelo kebab!! God knows how many times I have been there just to try this single dish.

I hardly order other things.because this dish is so full some. 

Though tried sizzlers ..baked fish etc.
Prices are not that high. All recommended.

Peter Cat! A name when pronounced gives us an image of a posh Dine in with fine wine and sophisticated ambiance.You are correct the image is exactly the same till there. What happens there after is a different story.Service is moderate. A slight hint of aristocratic arrogance if you will. Well lets get to the broader story. The guard outside scans you from the tip of your hair till the tip of ¬†toe scanning like K10's infrared scanner.
Once you are in the ambiance really will please you, I mean 10/10 for the ambiance on any given day.
Want some special care taken towards you, make sure you have pretty ladies around and trust me a swish of your hand will fetch you 2-3 greedy staff members at your disposal. Coming to the food(being the main reason why the rating goes up to 3.5) CHELO KEBAB.. Pure bliss of a dish, specially the dice of butter on the rice just tingles your olfactory senses. Mutton rogan josh is another worth while mention. Tender meat very well cooked. Me and my family also had chicken tandoori and it was a good buy. Price of the dishes are a bit on the higher side. But hey you are in peter cat mate that is expected.
Good dine will definitely visit more because of the food and ambiance.

It serves juicy and mouth watering Chelo kebab and Chicken sizzler. Price is good. and very reasonable. Worth trying. The waiters are well dressed up in smart Bengali uniforms. They are very efficient and give very good service.

Not legendary

The hype about the place landed me here and to my dismay, it was only the hype and hardly any substance. I am not a hard core fan of bengali cuisine where the use of egg with rice is considered a usual practice. I ordered the famed Chelo Kebab platter and it was ordinary. I didn't find it spectacular. My friends ordered sizzlers which were mundane too. To add to the negative experience, the service is slow. Also, do not visit on wekends as there are serpentine queues outside, for those hardcore buffs to are driven by the hype or the past legacy.The place seems to have lost its glory and with a plethora of fine dining options in Park St., a serious revamp needs to be done to sustain their customers.Food- 2/5
Ambience- 5/5 (yes, it is soothing and chic)
Service- 2/5
Value for money- 3/5

The experience I had at this place was quite a nice one. 
We ordered for the legendary Chelo Kebab and the Chicken Sizzler. I was absolutely mesmerised by the taste of the Chelo Kebabs! It was one of the most finely cooked pieces of meat I've tried. 
The sizzler was also amazing, to say the least.
Coming to the ambience and the staff. The seating was a little uncomfortable, as we both were tall and didn't seem to manage to fit our legs comfortably.
The staff were efficient but they were kind of rude. They even expected a tip after all the heavy service tax. I always believe in leaving a tip but I didn't like how they waited for us to actually give it to them, even though they didn't even bother to refill our glasses of water.
I would go back there for the amazing food nonetheless.

Had an amazing dinner with my family on my birthday last Sunday. This is the first time I had been there on a Sunday so had no clue about the rush we'd face and the fact that we'd have to wait in a queue for over an hour to get a seat at the dining table. However, it was worth the wait. The Fish Makhmali which we ordered as a starter was perfection. Had heard a lot of nice things about this dish at Peter Cat so we had to try it. It was mouth-watering! After this we ordered the Chicken Chelo Kebab (the original). It was delicious and was full and wholesome. The chicken kebabs were scrumptious and the egg was yummy to the core. I simply fell in love with the butter rice. The veggies in this dish jelled perfectly with the non veg items. It is advisable to people like my family for whom this dish was a bit excess that they should order two plates for 3 people. For dessert(which is a what I closely watch-out for in all restaurants and food places) we ordered the Meringue with Vanilla Ice cream and Hot Chocolate. And yes it tastes as good as it sounds. The hot chocolate which they serve separately in a small metal beaker is so so delicious. The vanilla ice cream was perfect too. And it must be added to every spoon of meringue you take in as the meringue has a tendency of hardening after a while. This hardening cause it to become caramelised-like and makes it difficult to scoop put with a spoon. Initially this is the condition on the top of the dish, however the meringue is perfect and crunchy with no difficulty of scooping with a spoon at the bottom of the dessert. I loved the way the dessert was served. My mom who has a sweet-tooth simply loved it. Thank you Peter Cat for the welcome and the great food experience and to all the people there who made our dining experience worthwhile and memorable.

I have been to this restaurant. I will begin with my experience and then describe the restaurant in general.First I came to this place on a Sunday night, and not to my surprise, it was overcrowded. We had to wait for 1.5 - 2 hrs before we got our name called. The restaurant is dark and ¬†has a weirdly trying-to-be-classy atmosphere. The furnitures were not in a very good condition, not sure whether lack of proper care or inability to afford. Anyway, the service was good.
Now coming to the food. Firstly, it was over hyped. I have been to very good restaurants in Mumbai and Bangalore and this is no way a match to them. Even small cafes in Bangalore, like Cafe Max, has better cooks than this place. Anyway, since in Kolkata people have limited access to good restaurants, I guess this has been able to stand¬†as a catch among rookies. ¬†Secondly, its over priced also. I paid 4.5k for 4 people, without any alcoholic drinks. Even Taj Bengal provides a better price to people ratio for non-alcoholic orders. By the way, the chello¬†kababs are good, but nothing special. You can get those kinds of kabab in normal restaurants like Tunday¬†Kabab. I was trying so hard to find atleast one rememberable thing from this restaurant, but could not.¬†
Overally, the atmosphere is questionable and the¬†food is okayish and prices are high compared to the service offered. Won't be coming back to this place for some time until I run out of options in Kolkata. Will keep on looking for better places.

located in the heart of Kolkata this place is a Landmark for food lovers from all over. Their Specialty is their famous Chelo Kabab.¬†
We had to wait for 15 minuets since the place was already filled up when we got there. The ambiance of the place is really something with warm lights and two floors of seating arrangement the ambiance is as good as it gets.¬†

Coming to the food we ordered their famous chelo kabab and Chicken Irani kabab. The chelo kabab was juicy and succulent with ample portion of butter rice ( which was very tasty) , the Irani kabab didn't disappoint as well and was great in terms of taste. The waiters were a little impatient.¬†

Overall rating....... Come visit this place to have the Best Chelo in town. :)
            

Came with my mother recently.... Ordered the Chelo Kabab (obviously ) and Chicken sweet corn soup..

The chelo kabab was fantastic as always.... now coming to the soup ..it was cold, bland, and not at all good......

Don't order the soup ..... I repeat do not order the soup... Happy Eating :)

The ambiance and quality of food are very good. We ordered Fish Makhmali and Chelo, their special dish. I liked the Fish Makhmali dish than Chelo. The Chelo Kebab dish is good, I would say 3.5/5. The staffs are humble and suggest properly. We were four people and was unaware of the quantity of fresh salad, so I ordered two dishes, however, the staffs suggested to take single dish as the quantity was enough for four people. Not many restaurant staffs suggest like this.

Order something which is standard item in peter cat, e.g. Chelo Kebab or most Sizzlers it will be a great food and experience. You order something outside regular stuff and you will be screwed. The waiters will not know the quantity and taste or anything about it. Final product will be disastrous. e.g. Never try shami kebab here if you have tasted it in some proper mughlai restaurants.

Have anything you want to..not only the recommended Chelo Kebabs & Fish with tarter sauce & Sizzlers... I bet you'll enjoy your plate of food. 

Staff - Not friendly but ok.

Before my trip to Kolkatta Chello Kebab at Peter Cat was a must have that everyone suggested. I reached the place at 1 and there was still a lot of waiting. Finally we got a table and ordered the famous Chello kebab also ordered the Mutton Biryani. The Chello kebabs were just awesome and we loved it. The kebabs were soft succulent juicy and the overall setup of the platter just works for u. The biryani also was amazing. The place has two floors and is really well made. The ambiance is good and though its always crowded service was really fast. The staff was helpful and explained to us what the chello kebabs were. A good experience lives upto the hype. Keep it up ! Must visit!

I went here in the late afternoon around 3 with my friends and still there was a long queue for the waiting list.There was a lady fighting over the staff not slotting a table even after waiting.This is what Kolkata lacks I feel, there is no professionalism here. There are many fine dining restaurants where you can't even reserve a table on call.
Anyways we waited for around 30 mins and got a table finally after little quarreling with the staff as we missed our turn.
The staffs have too much attitude and when you are in service industry, you need to know to handle customers with courtesy.
We all tried THE famous Chelo Kabab, to be very frank, there is nothing so special about it.I feel it to be over hyped but it tasted good.
3.8- To the food 
3- Staff and service.

Peter cat - the famous restaurant serving the renowned chelo kabab ....is a must visit...specially to check out how good the chelo kabab actually is!! The ambience is nothing special for a posh dinning in the heart of kolkata. The staff are also not polished in their customer service. The only thing good about this place is chelo kabab...which though is good but isnt that which will make you crave for more!! We also had virgin mary drinks...which is okeyish. The waitets shouting on top of their voice to the kitchen staff - "teen chelo" , "aath chelo" etc is a big thumbs down....

The name precedes the place - long queue, dim lights, not really sure if I like it. Had their famous chelo kebab. I liked it, but didn't love it! The chicken kebab was so so, and as for the rice, butter took over most of the taste buds. I don't eat mutton, so gave the mutton kebab to my friends. I can't really comment on that.
And oh, the washroom is tiny and not very clean.

Disappointment is the word that describes my experience at Peter cat today. We had to wait for 45 mins for our turn but it was not worth it. We ordered chelo kebab & chicken steak sizzler along with our drinks. Chelo Kebab was at its usual best - no qualms there. But the sizzler dish was a big disappointment - too salty to my liking. The biggest putoff though was the attitude & behavior of the staff. They are poor at crowd management - while we were inside we could see empty seats around us when there was a big queue outside. Courteousness is another thing they badly lack. I would in fact have given a still lower rating but for the heavenly chelo kebabs.

I guess I am late in providing a feedback / review for this resturant which has served generations together. I came with my family first in 1986 and till now nothing has changed. Even the quality. There hospitality and quality of food has withstood time and all odds.

They are an example to others to show quality rides over anything. I can go on with each one of their dishes. But I guess, what is required is paying tribute to some of their signatures like Chelos, sizzlers and Tandoor which gets the least recognition. I guess their tandoor is one of the best at Kolkata.

What makes this resturant different from others is their entire solution, team, ambience, delicious dishes and value for money. You cannot ignore anyone of them. If I am to identify some of their starters / appetisers, tandoori chicken comes to my mind or chicken miayonnese or chicken cold salad. Even the kabaabs are fantastic. Cold beeer with tandoori chicken or chicken miayonnese will set the tone for evening and a lunch. Their indian cusine is as good as their continental dishes. A special mention about prawn cocktail...... even if you are not a big fan of appetizers i guess, you should have it. I bet you will change your opinion !!

To end with caramel custard or even the other cold desserts are good to end your meal..!!

Enjoy your food with them !! They are awesome ;-)

Cheers..

Peter Cat is a legendary restaurant and is one of my favorites in the city. I've been to this place numerous times - so much so that I've actually lost count. Peter Cat is my one-stop shop for chello kebabs and sizzlers. Whenever I'm there, the only things that I order are chello kebabs and sizzlers. Both their sizzlers and chello kebabs are unparalleled in taste as well as presentation. I've tried 3-4 of their sizzlers - out of which the house special and the tandoori mixed grill are my personal favorites. I've also had the opportunity to try out both the original chello kebab as well as the mutton chelo kebab. Needless to say, both of them tasted very rich and authentic. The ambience too is a major plus point for them. I also remember having ordered a banana split once. The dessert was a poor effort, at the very least. Since I had had that particular dessert before at an ice cream parlour, I could easily make out the difference. My mother had ordered a souffl√© and was not satisfied as well. They could stand to improve the quality of the desserts I think. Apart from that little glitch in an otherwise flawless management and quality, this place will make you come back for more, time and again.

We ordered a number of dishes and all if them tastes fantastic. Chelo kebab was as usual had loads of buttery rice and juicy kebabs. The roast chicken was fabulous. Tandoori mixed grill sizzler was one of a kind and the my favourite house special sizzles was the best among the lot with soft piece a of chicken, sausages and liver. The dishes were extremely filling and reasonably priced. So now you know the place to go if you need to siz

If you are looking for a fine dining place at Park Street, Peter Cat it is. You can't complain anything about this place. As soon as you enter you get to see their wonderful ambiance. Lighted up beautifully with incandescent lights.
I went there on the birthday celebration of one my friend. We ordered for Chelo Kabab, Persian Pollao, Chicken Sahi Korma, Palak Panner. And each and everything was excellent as it should be in a standard restaurant. Quantity was also fine. But one rice dish won't be enough for two adults.
Beside food their service is excellent. One of the Waite stood beside our table all the time and was there for each and everything.
If you are planning to visit this place then all I can say is you will be fully satisfied. Must Visit :)

Peter Cat and Chelo Kebab are bearing the same meaning for quite a long now. One must try this famous Iranian dish at Peter Cat. Apart from this particular dish, you can try the sizzlers as well. However, I'd say that Peter Cat is loosing its old glory.

Unlike wine, everything does not age well. Peter Cat, a legendary destination has lost its glory big time. Though the restaurant along with ambience and the food is not very disappointing but nonetheless it's not as it was. The flooring has worn out and the table lights have become dusty. The staff too seems to be aware of the lost sheen. They care less both about the place and the customers. You have to keep them reminding to fill your glasses and to clean your table. Coming to the food-the Chelo Kebab was mediocre with both the chicken and mutton kebabs being overcooked. The chefs do have a tendency to overcook meats, even the mutton steak sizzler was tough and disappointing. The best part of today's meal was the appetizer-Fish Muniere,two crumb coated pieces of bhekti with generous coating of mayonnaise on top was a happy beginning of the meal. The sides were more impressive than the mains especially the roasted potatoes. I would not return for the meat dishes ever but one should go there for the old-world charm and the fish starters.

After constant brag about the Chelo kabab at this place by friends and family . Finally decided to try this out on my visit to Kolkata ,just next to flury's on Park Street . 

This place with a beautiful red lights will please your taste buds . We ordered for chicken Chelo kabab , brownie with icecream and a cocktail called the wedding night . 

Chelo kabab is the national dish of Iran . Peter cat's Chelo kabab version has steamed basmati rice topped with home made butter , poached egg , mutton seekh kabab and chicken tikka with capsicum , onion and tomatoes and all of it was perfect to the T . The brownie was also soft and fluffy with vanilla ice cream and a waft biscuit topped with hot chocolate sauce .

My local friends from Kolkata tell me that this place is generally full and on weekends there is a huge Que but we went on a Tuesday early evening so we're lucky to get a seat in 5 minutes .

Food -4.5/5

Today enjoyed a beautiful evening with Chelo Kebab, Kashmiri Chicken and Grilled Fish with my wife and Brother In Law. Taste remain same as before. Person who served the food and who takes the order both are polite in nature & even they provide us some advise pertaining to quantity we ordered.

This place was supposedly the talk of the town , so we decided to settle for this restraunt for a much awaited b'day lunch. As we entered , the dim lit ambience as well as the gracious behavior and traditional outfit of the waiters were a visual pleasure indeed. The chelow kebab was a dish that was repeatedly suggested by friends and family, and so we decided to give it a shot. The food though, was a bit to buttery for my liking, which other people might favour ( because i'm very finicky regarding my fat intake). The kebab however , was cooked to perfection, and the underlying bed of rice too was a perfect date for the roasted meat. Price was a bit high, particularly the included taxes, but nevertheless a nice restraunt for a weekend retreat :)

Ambience was nice.but there were no music at all.
A bit silence prevails all around.decoration is pretty good.for spending some personal time,place can be a good option.

If u are looking for a place to go with friends on a lunch or dinner,this is probably not the right place.

Food quality was pretty good.but biryani sucks,and so the chicken in it.chelo kebab is good,reshmi butter masala was good.malai kofta was nice too.but the quantity of both biryani and fried rice was not ok.

Oh.han.sausages are nice too.

But if u are planning to go with the whole squad, this is probably not the best place.they don't allow cakes too.

Let's just say - I couldn't figure out why this place is so famous. Visited once because of the hype, tried the legendary chello kebab - never visited again. Let me explain the dish for you - Seekh kebabs on one side, Tikkas on the other, Boiled rice with a boat load of butter in the middle topped with a fried egg !

The ambience of the restuarant is perfect with the quality of food-totally awesome. I went there with my friends and ordered mutton chelo kabab and beckty meunier. Chelo kabab was as usual awesome,but the second dish we tried for the first time was heavenly. The white sauce on beckty fish along with potatoes it was like a dish made in heaven. The service was very good and of course once again the amazing ambience which made me want to eat there all the time. The only thing, as my friend

This place is famous for their chelo kebab. Its one of extremely popular restaurant . Evn i can say petercat is a shining star of kolkata.

Location: this is located in park Street. Just Opposite to the parkstrt Kfc.

About restro : ambiance was good with classy decor. Food quality and quantity both was pretty good. They have quick sevice.The stuffs are always on a run to meet the  expectations. There are two floors which are decorated with dim lights and comfortable sitting arrangements. 


Fish fry:  for starters we ordered fish fry. It was really good. Fish lovers can go for this and it will never disappoint u. it was really impressive.

Chelo kebab: this one comes with flavored rice with butter cubes,grilled chicken,mutton kebabs,salad and topped with a egg poach. It was delicious and quantity was more than enough for one prsn. The entire platter is just yum!!

Tutti-frutti icecrm : it was good. Nothing special. Served wth Mixed fruits and strawberry and vanilla scoops with one wafer slice.

I can't say its a pocket friendly restro but the prices are moderate. if u want to go for this restro u need to take some time in ur hand,because its always full.  Continental food lovers will definitely enjoy their extremely tasty dishes..
Highly recommended!!

Peter Cat is located just opposite of KFC.
This is surely one place that needs no introduction. This place is known for it's Chello Kabab, which is exquisite. We had visited this place for a birthday lunch. We had ordered Prawn cocktail which is another lip-smacking dish but sadly that day it was not upto my expectations. We also had Chello Kabab(ofcourse) and Chicken Sizzlers( amazing as always). We had also ordered red wine.
The ambience is beautiful, dark-dimmed.
Service is very good, well behaved staff.

One of the iconic places. People who have not visited this place yet, you're missing something amazing!

The Chelo Kebab.
Don't think twice, just order it. Quality, taste, quantity everything is just too good. I have been there too many times and have always ordered Chelo. 
People might think its just a kebab but then its a complete dish which includes rice, a cube of butter, an omelet, two kinds of kebabs. And trust me all of it is good, like real good. A must try. The sizzler here is equivalently famous as the chelo however I did not like it personally. If you ask me to suggest you I would say chelo without thinking twice.

Coming to the main part the food, one of my favouraite dishes out here is tandoori broccoli & Mix Veg Sizzler. The presentation of the dishes are so appealing, and tasteful.

Just opposite to KFC park Street is this renowned restaurant of park Street, Peter cat! Little did we plan about coming here but when we did , the line waiting outside the restaurant   made us sure we chose the right place! Our 20 minutes waiting lead us into what I call "divine atmosphere". We ordered the famous chello kabab and fried rice and biriyani and a chicken reshmi butter masala! The only thing which lacked appreciation is the biriyani which did not taste like the regular biriyani we usually get in Kolkata! Rest was nice! Had a great fun time out there

After making so many plans and cancelling each time for many reasons finally we checked in there.We went on Sunday for lunch and had to wait for 30 minutes to get the seat.We ordered their signature dish chello kabab and after having 1 spoon I realised why people come here to eat this! It's a wholesome meal and a plate of this is more than enough.The taste is just heavenly and would like to come back to this place for chello kabab for infinite number of times! The price is very reasonable also. I would recommend all the people who are from Kolkata and those who aren't must come to this place and taste chello kabab once and you would know why it's their signature dish.

Located in Park Street this restaurant needs no introduction. Their mouth watering chello kebabs, steaks everything is superb. The only thing to be kept in mind is if you are planning for lunch or dinner on a weekend do make sure that you have sufficient time in hand because there is always a long queue. We used to go there quite often with my aunt and her family and even now when they come to Kolkata it is their favourite spot. Quality and quantity both are good. Pricing is decent. Ambience is nice. Staff busy but attentive and experienced.

Kolkata's biggest and one of the most talked about places. Talked about only because of the most popular dish the Chelo Kebab platter. The Virgin Mary is a huge try out. Alcohol, as usual.

So finally visited Peter Cat- one of the iconic restaurants of Kolkata. Dim lights, great ambience, good service and amazing food is all you need to fall for this place. Had their iconic dish- Chhelo Kabab, and for reasons well known to everyone, this dish is actually very good and will make sure that you come back craving to this place again and again. We ordered a veg chhelo kabab and a non veg chhelo kabab. the veg chhelo kabab comes with hot white rice served with a dollop of butter, paneer kababs,  veg seekh kababs and a veg cutlet mind of a thing. The non veg chhelo kabab comes with same hot rice served with butter, chicken kababs, mutton seekh kabab and topped with a poached egg. To our surprise , even the veg chhelo kabab was good to eat, but sheer delight was the non veg chhelo kabab. Everything was cooked to perfection and it was a complete meal in itself.

Do visit :)

Well this was a place where chelo kabab was invented and gradually became the most famous dish of this place.. And i must say it should be famous also..  Because it was awesome..  Coming to sizzlers they were average..  And my god main course was really below average..  We tried almost all kind of dishes but chelo kabab marked it spot..  Even desserts were not up to the mark..  Trying on 3 different typ of desserts and max were below average but one was just ok..  All over nice place to go for dinner outing or hangout but not that great as it was before..

Peter Cat = Chelo Kebabs. 
My understanding of this place is synonymous with their most popular delicacy of Chelo Kebabs. Though their menu is filled with mouth watering delicacies including the sizzlers, this place is loved, adored and worshipped for their Chelo Kebabs. A must go for non veg lovers. Wonderful ambience and good service. On peak hours expect a waiting time for an hour atleast.

Quality and quantity both were good. Prawn cocktails were a little too sour for my taste but nevertheless I liked it.I find the price not too steep as well.

Truly the pioneer of Chelo Kebabs in Kolkata , Peter cat lives up to the hype. After a short waiting time of 15 mins we ordered a portion of non-veg Chelo and veg Chelo kebabs. Both the kebabs were served on a bed of rice with butter , kebab skewers and half fried egg ( on non veg platter ). The kebabs tasted excellent with a chilled pint of beer . We will definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu.

PETER CAT - Well one of the most known restaurants for Chelo Kebabs and sizzlers truly has earned the fan following. I have visited the place quite a few times with friends and family and have always loved the food. Located in one of the most happening areas of Kolkata, i.e., Park Street, this place offers lovely dim light decor. Staff is courteous and service is good. Food quantity is sufficient and prices are mostly at par with similar restaurants. Since the place is always overloaded with foodies, one has to wait outside for their turn to come. Recommended for a cozy romantic dinner.

PETER CAT- one of the most famous restaurant of Kolkata or should I call it "so called famous" don't even know how to treat their customer. I along with a friend of mine was waiting in queue for dinner, they allowed other two people(couple of course) before letting us in, without even asking us whether it's okay with us. I don't have any problem letting others go in front of me in a queue, but people must have the basic courtesy to ask the one standing ahead. Isn't it??? 
And this was done by no other than the manager of the place. "Great n Famous Restaurant."

On my first visit to the City of Joy, the first meal I had was at Peter Cat. I had had a recommendation to try the Chelo Kebabs and there I was, on my way to discovering a lovely place and a lovely meal. Situated on Park Street, Peter Cat takes you to an earlier era. The place has an old world charm about it - the ambience, the menus, the busboys and their uniforms just add to the feel.

Without much ado, I ordered the Chelo Kebabs. It is a complete meal in itself and a sumptuous one at that. The flavours were earthy, and the portions quite adequate. It is a meal that will surely leave you happy at the end of it.

An iconic restaurant on a iconic street of Calcutta, Peter Cat has been a frequented restaurant for me for more than a decade now. ¬†Apart from their specialty, the Chelo Kebab, I also love their Baghdadi chicken which is a mild chicken preparation and it goes really well with rice. On my last visit I also gave the chicken pakoras a try and they were good and complimented the beer.

What can you say about such an iconic place which hasn't already been said or written.  It still has the charm of the English Era and takes you back onto that timeline. This place is famous for its sizzles as well as its Chelo kebab. But the Indian spread available here is also very good.  The food menu has enough options for everyone and none of the items disappoint. 
We always order a mix grilled sizzler and a house special sizzler.  The quantity is sufficient for one person and the taste is brilliant.  The sizzle,  the look the generous quantity...everything's great. For starters we have tried the seekh kebab,  tandoori broccoli, raja gaulati kebab,  fish makhmali and all have been great.  The fish lovers can also go for fish meunier and it will not disappoint you. The north Indians can try the shah nauz or Afghani chicken with any variety of Naan (this place serves one of the softest Naan's on Kolkata). 
The only drawback is the waiting period even on weekdays for dinner. 
Overall an excellent place which serves great food and good ambience and it's not very expensive. A definite must visit for everyone.

A long line in front of the resraurant if what you can see almost every single time and this place truly deserves all the attention. With its legacy and quaint, sophisticated interiors, Peter Cat, is a restaurant I would recommend without a second thought. The paintings add to the victorian-,esque decor and aura of the place. The chelo kabab lived up to its reputation. Soft paneer and lots of it. The other starters were equally sumptuous like galouti kabab and irani tikka (dont remember the exact name). The drinks are reasonably priced with a good variety. The table lamp is lit well enough to make you feel cozy and comfortable. If you are heading to Kolkata, I would strongly recommend you to give Peter Cat a shot.

Located in the heart of the city, this legendary restaurant is still one of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata. On arrival, you need to always wait for at least 15 minutes before you get a place inside.¬†
The restaurant is extremely packed and noisy, but the food makes up for the noise and the wait.I have been there several times and always without fail ordered the non-veg Chello Kebabs.¬†
Chello Kebab is an Iranian dish which consists of buttered rice served with two different kinds of Kebabs- one is a lamb sheek kebab and the other one is chicken reshmi kebab. This meal is enough for one person, and in my opinion you need not order anything else.¬†In short,¬†1. Great food
2. Noisy and crowded.
3. Need to wait for 15 minutes + before you get a table.

Ok. So finally i could manage to visit THE RESTAURANT i have had heard so much about. If you have been in kolkata you must have heard about peter Cats's Chelo Kabab. And no doubt it was great. no questions asked. So was the Brownie.
But the Sizzling chicken steak,it did not mesmerise me that much.

Well to be ¬†honest, I didn't like the Chelo Kebab... those were kind of Jhelo Kebab, may be because I am from Hyderabad, the city of kebabs. The fresh lime soda had sugar crystals in it.. come on guys.. crystals!!!! Peter Cat doesn't have Sugar Syrup!!!!!
The savior for the rating was Veg Sizzler... for that 3 marks.¬†

Environment was kind of dull due to less lighting. Overall, avoidable for people who have had luxuries for eating food in Delhi & Hyderabad

As I entered the place I was welcomed by a magnificent setting. The menu offered a wide variety of mouth-watering foods. I had House Special Sizzler (served super hot) which was followed by a delicious Strawberry Blossom/Crush. The price was reasonable and the service was quick and nice and I had a pleasant dining experience with my friend for this reason I highly recommend people to visit the restaurant. :)

Legendary is what they say when one thinks of Peter Cat. I have been visiting this place since I was 6 and this place has never disappointed. The long queues outside the entrance even on weekdays is enough to know how popular it is amongst the city crowd. Apart from the regular Chelo Kebab, I suggest do try out the other items on offer, especially the dum ki raan and irani kebab. I personally do not prefer the Sizzlers though.

This place has gained a legendary status over time, and that is quite evident with the long queues outside the entrance even on weekdays. And a week a go was the first time I managed to visit, with a friend who was back from the US.

My friend ordered the famous Chello Kebab, while I went for a Grilled Beckti. I have had this dish numerous times at numerous places, including at restaurants in a smaller city like Siliguri (my hometown) , and it was better.

The fish couldn't satisfy my hunger, and I ordered a Chicken Liver Fry. And that was OK, as expected. Nothing extraordinary. I have always wondered about the fame of this place, but I personally feel Mocambo and Bar-b-q are far better.

Peter Cat is that one place for which I can review a 100 times over. What a place to be! Although I haven't had a meal here for years, but I am sure it's the same old amazing place it used to be when I was growing up in the City Of Joy.

For me, this restaurant is more of a nostalgia. I remember waiting in the queue for at least 30 minutes to an hour every year during the Durga Puja and the Christmas for getting a table in this restaurant. After all, those are the times the city of Kolkata is on the streets and want to sample the best flavours on offer.

I haven't really explored every part of the menu, because I used to have two of the things that everyone comes to eat here. Chello Kebab and the Sizzlers.¬†

As a travel writer, I have travelled to many parts of the country and have eaten in several places. But no place in this country can serve better sizzlers.¬†

And I don't think I can say much about the Chello Kebab. I would say it's a heritage dish of Kolkata and one that can never be explained, but only experienced. No wonder, actor Rishi Kapoor once got it packed and take it back to Mumbai.

In fact, I am so much in love with this place that I can recommend somebody to travel to Kolkata just to have a meal in this restaurant.

To the Peter Cat management, I would just like to say one thing: thank you for being one of the most beautiful parts of my childhood. For me, you will always be the best.

As the Vulcans say, "Live long and prosper!"

Cheers!

If you are visiting Peter Cat, you should go for the chello kebab before anything else.
It is simply heavenly here and their speciality dish.

For sizzlers,I once had the House speciality sizzler here and believe me it was nothing special.
On the contrary that is the worst sizzler I have had in my entire life. On top of which me and my friend had to order two large pegs of vodka just to gobble that miserable thing down.

The ambience is great and being one of the most famous restaurants in the city, you can expect the prices to be what you may expect at Park Street restaurants but nothing too unreasonable or too OTT.

Food quality is also great but a single plate of chello kebab might just fill more than half of your tummy if you are a mediocre level eater.

For sizzlers I would suggest Mocambo but Peter Cat is too legendary a restaurant to skip in Kolkata.

The one resto that comes to my mind with park street is peter Cat..i feel attached to it cuz the no of times i visited and being the first resto that i went to. At last this review..
Seating are comfy..all the places r soo good except the one just beside the entrance. Lights are perfect and decor is justified.
Well behaved staffs..u can get info on all items but they might serve a bit late sometimes.
Now the food..
Chelo Kebab needs no separate mention cuz its The best in the town. Sizzlers are delicious, one might not leave even the veggies a bit,
recently tried nalli gosht(dry) which was not really good in taste and insufficient as per the price.
But trying different dishes here would not disappoint you cuz they do have a standard and it is not a pocket friendly restaurant.

Peter Cat is one of those extremely popular family restaurants in Park Street which is almost full to bursting on any day of the month. With beautiful dim lights and a two storeyed dining zone, Peter Cat resonates elegance and heritage. Renowned for their Sizzlers, their signature Chelo Kabab and Mixed Sizzlers are a people favourite. Their Indian cuisine too boasts of good flavours. What more, you get decent cocktails to wash down your food with. The cost is reasonable considering its popularity and it still remains a go to place for many a family looking for a Sunday lunch together.

LAST REVIEW -- 2 months ago -- "I've been a regular here for many years now, but sad to see that the quality and the quantity has gone down just a little bit. No offence to the management or the great chefs on board - may be my visit was on a bad day, but whatever the case might be, it was a bit unsatisfactory. Buck up guys. I want to be able to bring my kids here in the future and tell them that this is where their parents used to date. There is always room for improvement, so it's time to change gears. Don't worry about prices - if you provide quality, you will get what you deserve. In my 6 years of being a house special sizzler and chello kabab lover, this is my first review. So, will update this if I notice improvements. :-)

To other food lovers who haven't been here: - Don't worry. This is still Peter Cat. They can still surprise you. So step in, and prepare to be surprised.
" -- LAST SCORE GIVEN -- 4.0

UPDATE -- 11.08.2016

My last review sure seems to have worked, because today I had perhaps the finest and most well prepared house special sizzler I've had in my 4 years of being a "Petercatian". My girlfriend ordered her usual Chello Kabab original, which was as usual perfection personified, or rather foodiefied. (no pun intended). These were clubbed with our usual Fresh lime soda, and the entire thing was topped of with Large tutti fruti, which was spectacularly fruity, and definitely tasty. ¬†Now for some special announcement. Today was the first time i ordered alcohol at a restaurant. I chose Peter Cat because this place has given me some of the best memories in the last one year. We ordered Tuborg pints, which were served in those metal mugs which I was sooo in love with. The entire experience was wonderful. The staff was its usual courteous special, and we finally found a sit on the upper level, which I actually prefer more than the ground floor. The price was as usual affordable. I am increasing 0.5 points due to the obvious improvements I noticed today. Thank you for a wonderful meal.

The authentic flavours of Kolkata has a plate of Chelo Kebabs and Meat extravaganzas in it. The taste and the ambience happily forces the mugs of beer to cheers. The taste has dropped a bit from before but that can be rectified. Other than that, I would love to stand in queue to enter the gate of stupendous platters. Cheers :-)

I was very disappointed because of my experience yesterday. Me along with my 9 friends went to the restaurant at around 6 o clock in the evening. First of all they did not have any arrangement to deal with a group a 10 customers. Secondly, behaviour of the staff was extremely rude. It was our first visit and we decided that it is our last visit as well.

If you prefer privacy and dim light then you'll love it... The place had a decent service. We ordered the very clich√©d chelo kebab and grilled chicken sizzler for main course and one iced coffee with cream , maringue and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate and brownie vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate as dessert. The sizzler is sweet and mellowed....I know this would sound weird bt try the cabbage of the sizzler...god they are really tasty... Coming to the chelo , it has butter rice, a reshmi kebab two mutton tikka sticks sprinkled with some salad. The items we chose were in general not at all spicey....rather buttery and creamy. The ice cream was my favourite. The maringue vanilla with hot chocolate has a crunchy sweet muffin above a square chunk of vanilla ice cream. The chocolate sauce is not the typical hershey sauce ... Its a thick gooey sauce , low on sweet yet very yummy. The dessert is what I seriously enjoyed. If you like continental or Ondian you should definitely check it out.

We had ordered the famous chello kebab and Grilled chicken sizzler and fresh lime soda.The chello kebab was great! Really tasty and delicious. Coming to the sizzler,the chicken was good but vegetables on the side were bland and of weird cuts. For Desserts we had brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce( Do order this! It's absolutely chocolate heaven) and meringue with ice cream and chocolate sauce(which was good too) and iced coffee with cream.

Peter cat- another pilgrimage for foodies in the Park Street area apart from its classy aristocrat competitor Mocambo. For starter, I prefer cream of chicken asparagous compared to other available soups. The original Chelo Kabab needs no introduction and is a standard order whenever I visit there. But last time I tried chicken Marakesh and¬† loved it. The house special chicken steak is also delicious. The foods are well cooked and served with beautiful garnishing. But I deducted 1.5 points because my recent experience at Peter cat was not as comfortable like my earlier visits. This time I felt that their attention is mostly devoted to the 1st floor section: so we had to wait relatively long time to order and also pay bill. Maybe it was for that particular day only pertaining to stuffs' absent or something but if it is not the case they should take care of the matter whatsoever.

Yea 5/5..cuz that's what it deserves..and I'm gonna rate it just for the food. The food had taken over all other things. You get into an mad foodgasm when you eat here. Although the ambiance is pretty good and the staff was also nice, the place is well jam packed with over 30 mins of waiting on a Saturday afternoon. The bar menu is not very expensive. 
What you should try if you're a newbie here:
Chello kebabs or marakesh
Chicken steak
What they can better up: 
The cocktails. Should include some new cocktails.

My first visit was back in Christmas of 2009 with my cousins. Since then so many visits on so many special occasions - my first date, school reunion, parents' anniversary and so on..

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Dimly lit place with good ambiance. Staffs are formal. Not so friendly. Service is okay.

FOOD: The famous Chelo Kebab. The rice with butter on top.. just yum!
I also like their Biryani Ala Nawabi.
The Chicken Tandoori is okay. Nothing special.
Cream of Chicken Asparagus soup is just awful!
So is the Chicken Steak Sizzler which is the WORST STEAK SIZZLER I've ever had in my life. The sauce is too salty and is just plain soya sauce. NEVER EVER TRY IT!

I keep going back to Peter Cat mainly because of it's Chelo Kebab. The kebabs are nothing too great but the entire platter with the butter rice is what pulls me here.

I mean where to start, came back here after almost 3 years, no change, same pathetic hospitality, in the whole chelo kebab platter the best part was the rice and the butter, I mean what can be worse than this, initially provided us with a table by the door and was reluctant in changing the same upon many requests, how ever we kept insisting and found ourselves a better place, in was not that crowded at that point of time the taste has gone down over the years, it only runs for the overhyped name, not coming back, ever again..

When in doubt,go to peter cat! This restaurant never disappoints. Be it their sizzlers or chelo kebab or irani kebab or salad or dessert..every dish I've tried to so far has only made me fall a little more for this place!

Being a strict anti-healthy food person, the name salad manages to make my soul shiver with fear. However, the cold chicken salad at peter cat is something that managed to tickle my taste buds in a good way! 
The mixed tandoori grill sizzler is something that you absolutely must try! It has chicken,mutton,egg,liver,prawn and what not! It's essentially every non-vegetarian foodie's dream come true. 

You know that extra space that your stomach secretly  has stashed away? The one that's available only for that extra plate of your favourite food? I'd never come to know of it if not for Peter Cat. 
This one time,after having a tummy-full of their delicious food when I think I'm about to burst and there's no way that I could eat anything more,my friend decided to order us this dessert(Chocolate brownie with vanilla icecream and hot chocolate sauce). The journey from "I'll have just one spoon" to eating the entire dessert was something I'll remember forever. Even as I pen this down,I can hear my tummy gurgling for some more of that dessert. You cannot go peter cat and not have that dessert,that'd be a cardinal sin! 
Here's hoping you love this place as much as I do. Highly recommended. Bon apetite! :D

Nice place to visit with family and friends. Went there on last week with wife and sister to celebrate our anniversary. We ordered chelo kebab and two sizzlers,  mutton hamburg steak sizzler and chicken sizzlers. Both were awesome. Only problem I face all the time with Peter cat is the waiting time. We had to wait 1.5 hrs to enter there. Thus is the only draw back I faced all the time at Peter cat..:(

Peter Cat and Chelo Kabab are synonymous today. And why not they are still maintaining the same quality if this Iranian food for long years. The popularity is so that you don't get the seat easily at lunch time or evening. I feel the ambience is dated today. But if it's Chelo kabab you have to taste it here.

I visited this place couple of time and never disappoints me..Not only weekends,everyday itis crowded.Hard find seats. Their hospitality and service is more than awesome. They will never give you any chance to complain.
And their food is just lip-smacking, specially their chello kebab and House special chicken steak sizzler. And the dessert section is also very tempting,....Will visit soon

Not really a big fan of the place.  Ambience of the place is just fine. There is a vintage feel to the entire place. 
Food is ok ok.  The chelo kebab was served cold ruining the entire taste. Apart from that the taste of other dishes was not as expected.  
I'm sure there is a huge fan following to this place, but I'm sorry to say that it didn't work for me.

If you want to have the best quality Chelo Kebab, then Peter Cat is the place to go. The food quality, the ambience is certainly commendable. The price of the food is a bit on the higher side but I'm sure the quality of the food will make you feel that you've paid the right price for it.

Visited for the first time. We had to wait for around 45-60mins to get the seats though it was a Sunday afternoon,the wait was painful. Service is good but can be better. Ambience is very good. We ordered peter cat's famous chelo kabab,biriyani and chicken bharta. The food is quite good. Totally it is an awesome place to have lunch or dinner.. Will visit it again soon.

Mention chelo kebabs to any Calcuttan (there will never be a true Kolkatan) and they will send you packing to Peter Cat. Don't go by appearances, most vintage joints on Park Street will look rundown when compared to their peers in other metros.

Step in and get immersed in the wonderful world of Anglo-Indian cuisine. Chelo kebabs are always a treat here (though I have had better Iranian fare elsewhere). Baked Chicken and Beckty Meunier are absolute delights.

Come in all ye doubters, walk out with a far better outlook on life.

Durga pujo without a customary visit to Peter cat is no pujo at all. Predictable and fast service. Delicious food. Don't think too much. Just go in with an empty stomach and order whatever you fancy on the menu card. You'll not be disappointed. 
If you are looking to eat out but don't wanna exercise your brain muscles trying to choose a place, then just go to Peter cat and i assure you that you'll not regret it.

One of the best places I've been in Park Street. If you are looking for a place to try out kebabs, Peter Cat is definitely the place for you. Ordered chelo kebabs, which is their speciality, pea pulao, malai kofta and Afghani chicken all of which tasted really good. 
The service is really good. Our friends were late, so we asked the staff to serve the food 30 minutes after placing the order and it was wonderfully managed by them. The ambience was amazing as well. We didn't have to wait for long to get a table. The dessert, chocolate but sundae that we ordered was good too. 
Overall it was a very good experience. Would love to visit again. :)

This is one place which is extremely hyped in & around Park Street.¬†We¬†tried to go to Peter Cat at 3 occasions but due to extreme waiting time of over 30-45 mins & limited office lunch time, we have to always skip. We could make it once considering it was raining (no waiting time)¬†& we got the seat with due respect. The place looks very classic & service is extremely fast. I found the food to be decent & were happy to see the excitement of¬†my office colleagues who were feeling blessed to get the table here. I still didn't understood why there was so much craze to eat in Peter Cat & what was the hype all¬†about :)¬†This place is right opposite Saurav Ganguly's Hotel so may be they are waiting to see the glimpse of Saurav Ganguly :D Jokes apart, the place is found to be extremely busy on all weekdays & weekends. The staff is always on a run to meet the expectation & the restaurant is doing a good job. Must go if you get the¬†table :P

Coming to the food and I say this after visiting this restaurant innumerable no of times ...the 2 dishes which stands out head and shoulders above other dishes is their most coveted and iconic dish chelo kabab and mutton Rogan Josh....the other dishes or the sizzlers are ok but anything special
..
Ambience is nothing extraordinary.. quite congested...the staffs are not at all cordial which was a big disappointment for me....

An icon that's stood the test of time. What's Kolkata w/o Peter Cat (or its European sibling Mocambo)? Food, service, staff, location - one can't possibly fault any of these. Prices are a tad high but this is Park St. Soon it will cost to breathe the air here! Try the sizzler. It looks amazing! My dining partner and I went for the Chelo Kabab which I found alright - it had copious amounts of cream (butter) for my liking. 

My only regret - and it's a pretty big one - is that a restaurant of this repute doesn't accept AMEX!!! Hence the rating of 4.

I guess this legendary restaurant at the heart of Kolkata is most famous for its chello kebab. So, we went there and ordered chello kebab and chicken steak. The staff were cordial, and our order arrived after a very short wait, this wait, nonetheless didn't affect the food quality. The chello kebab was the best thing I ever had in a while. However, I didn't like the chicken steak as much. For dessert, we ordered merignue with hot chocolate sauce which was equally mouth-watering. This place has my heart.

I think anybody who has been to parkstreet has seen the waiting line infront of the gates of Peter cat. Many a times we have turned away because of that. Last day, the four of us finally got a table and all the delicacies mentioned as special in the zomato page of peter cat. The quantity was sufficient ,food quality lip-smacking.,the dim-lit ambience with lanterns perfect for fine-dining.
We ordered the signature chelo kabab, chicken steak sizzler, mutton hamburger steak,chicken marakesh and lastly mango souffle as desert.
We also had the grilled fish as starter.
Definitely satisfied and impressed.
Would definitely like to revisit again.

The chelo kebab was worthy of its fame.The sizzler and the kebab was so filling we had to pack the biriyani home. It's one of the most popular and decently priced restaurants in the city worthy of visit.

I found the place to be average at best. The hype and legacy around the place will make sure you have to wait almost an hour to get a table inside the dimly lit restaurant. The service is inconsistent and might just turn you off. The food overall is good with Chelo Kebab being the show stealer. Other food items too are pretty decent. My pallette might be very different from a typical Bengali pallette and hence take my review with a pinch of salt.

Was here 2 weeks ago. This place was always in my bucket-list. "Chelo-Kebabs at Peter Cat" - yeah I had longed for them since I had first heard abt the dish around 5-6 years back. Finally I urged our group to go and have lunch here. The decoration and the theme is unique, to say the least. Quite a palatial feel abt this place, with all the getup the waiters have, I'm sure anyone would want to be here. The food is served pretty fast after the order is given, unlike many places. The hospitality is gentle and nice. The ambience is top-class. The main problem is the tax that comes with the bill - it includes all the hospitality and well-being the place provides. Let that amount be a surprise. We ordered 2 chelos and 2 chicken sizzlers - which were delicious and suited our appetite quite well. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Go on, have a nice meal with your loved ones. :)

Being a classic restaurant of Kolkata, there is a waiting time you need to pay to enter :p But after you get a table by several whining and jhogra, the food is really good. We ordered Mutton steak sizzler and chelo kabab. For my tastebuds chelo kababs were average but I really liked the steak.

A legendary restaurant located in Park Street, this place was probably tagged as the first to introduce the delicious chello kebabs to the Kolkata foodies (okay, lemme be a lil straightforward, to the Petuk Bangalis). The sizzlers and the chello kebabs are the highest selling dishes here probably and I happen to eat these things whenever I go.

On Sunday me and 1 of my friend finally got to pay a visit after approaching it for the fourth time. There has always been a long que and so we decided to reach early for our lunch. Peter Cat always reminds us of chelo kabab so we ordered that. I liked the rice which they serve in this platter. The chicken kabab is also yummy and its soft and tender. The mutton sheikh which is also served along with the platter tastes pretty good. However they also add cubes of butter over the rice which i dont find it necessary because the rice itself tastes good. We also wanted to try some other dish so we ordered for nalli gosht a prepeparation on mutton and it was really awesome and i would highly recommend. Its really soft and it seems to melt once u put inyour mouth. Finally we ordered for mango mouse and dat also was pretty good.

Peter Cat is one of the iconic restaurants of Kolkata. It's been here for almost half a century and you know it's here to stay. Located on Park Street among many other restaurants, this place would still almost always have a waiting, weekday, weekend, lunch, dinner.

It is an out an out family restaurant with ample seating, mellow lights with the iconic shades over each table and good food. The chelo kebab is the most famous dish here and it is a favourite order and every table has one. It's a complete meal with steamed rice served with more than a dollop of butter, a sunny side up and the kebabs with salad. It's pretty heavy though. Apart from the chelo kebab the menu has a lot to offer too. It is a mix of Indian dished and foods with the middle east and European influence. With the sizzlers and steaks and cutlets and roast, one would never run out of options. We also tried the chicken steak. Among the desserts, the brownie with ice cream is a must try. The brownie here has the perfect texture, its crisp, brittle but still hold itself and just spreads in your mouth.

The prices are moderate. The privacy is a bit low but then would not exactly mind it, it's a merry place. The service can be better but then the food makes up for it.

Being in Kolkata, Peter Cat must be on your list. 

Happy eating!!!

I don't think I need to say more with this as perhaps the name "Peter Cat" says all. And well,It stands out with its  legendary aura. It was a treat from my sister so she decided to visit this place for dinner. This famous food joint is located just opposite to the KFC(park Street) As we reached this place ,we saw a massive queue outside the restaurant and Near about after 40 min we entered with a warm welcome into this dimly lit restaurant .so it's friendly suggestion if you want to visit this place come with 1 hour extra in your hand to stand on the queue .

Food we ordered :
üí£Chello kebabs 
üí£Chicken sizzler 
üí£Grilled bhetki
üí£Ice cream cola
üí£Chocolate nut sundae 
All dishes were extremely tasty . Behavior of Staffs were very prompt and humble. Overall,It was an amazing experience.

A legendary restaurant of Kolkata, this is one of the landmark places to eat in this city. On most days it is very difficult to get a seat during peak hours as it is always teeming with people. But the wait is worth its weight in gold....I can assure you that. The Chelo Kebab is the signature dish here, so also the sizzlers. Other items like Biryanis, mutton Rogan Josh etc. are pretty good too. Service is very quick and highly hospitable staff are there, who attentively attend to the customers. The ambience is a class of its own with dim orange lights and comfortable old school seating arrangements. If you plan to visit Peter Cat....do so with some time in your hands cause there is always a waiting time before you get a seat. Just love being here....every nook and corner of this restaurant screams HERITAGE and there is a strange romance to it.
The romance with Peter Cat will always continue.....

Went there with 3 of my friends on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Had to wait just for 5 minutes, which I feel was lucky coz often I find people waiting outside, specially on Saturdays. Tried there famous Chelo Kabab. Which I personally felt was ok (rather over hyped). Also tried some other stuffs and found them to be average still. Though didn't went complete wrong with any of the dish ordered, subsequently didn't find anything great either. Ambience & services were also the same as the food (just okay). Overall to sum up - Nothing bad, nothing great, just okay.

Peter Cat, is of course, one of the most distinguished restaurants in Kolkata. We had ordered for their most popular dish - Chelo Kebab. Rice, served with 2 types of kebabs, 1 egg poch, and half a tomato n a cube of half melted butter on top of the rice, this dish is absolute love. Sufficient quantity at the price of Rs.325. Next we had this Chicken Steak Sizzler which was also topped with an egg poch, and was also mouth watering. Apart from these, we ordered fresh lime soda and a cocktail named Long Time-Brandy Collins. Fresh lime soda, was normal. But Brandy Collins was the best part of the entire treat. It was perfecfly made, and I totally loved it.
The ambience here is posh. Courteous staff. I love their outfit, they wear a traditional outfit with a turban. Pocket friendly place. Altogether, I had an amazing experience at Peter Cat.

But somehow i feel ehat peter cat used to be 10-15 years ago that Peter cat is not their. The quality detoriates a bit on occasional days like Durga pujo, Christams, new year etc. They have this quick service which is great and ambiance is charismatic! Thanks Peter cat for being their for us!

This is one place which will be packed to the brim ANY day of the week, lunch or dinner! 
Wednesday evening, 7 15 pm: the place was already full, and the ten minute wait made the food taste better! 
Among 4 people, we ordered two veg Chello Kebab and a sizzler. In fact, we couldn't even complete the whole thing!
The kebabs were warm and fresh, paneer was marinated very well. Stuffed tomato and potatos were good. The sizzler was also good, but it doesn't overtake the chello kebab. 

Downside- extremely slow service! Even if I don't mind that because the food was so good, I cannot overlook the 20-25 mins they took to just hand us the bill.

The name of this restaurant sounds very curious and idiosyncratic and obviously it demands a visit. Peter cat is a dimly lit sophisticated and a posh restaurant in the heart of the city . This restaurant serves indian and continental food. The chello kebab is the main attraction of this place and it gives the customers a divine and an exquisite dining experience . The service was excellent and staff generally stays attentive to the needs of the customer. This place is already very famous among all sections of people and will retain this popularity as long as they advocate quality :-)

Peter cat, one of the most beloved dinner destination for the food lovers.. If you are visting there for the first time, ordering chello kebab will be the best investment.. the ambience is lil aristricratic, and food quality is undoubtedly good.. Sizzlers are also a good choice..

Had chelo kebab,tandoori mix grill,masala kulcha anf prawn curry with my family... thank god we did not have to stand for long but didnt like the ambience inside .. it was too crowded and not spacious ... although service was good and food was served on time... the chelo kebab being a speciality is a must have and tandoori mix grill was pleasurable in taste but was not served with naan or rice... masala kulcha and prawn curry were good.Overall above average experience here :)

One should make sure to have reservations no matter which day of the week it is because Peter Cat is always full. Yes, we love this legendary place so much. The chello kebabs are a blockbuster and so are the sizzelers and desserts. Also,the cocktails, they are amazing. Now,what do I say about the decor? The dim lighting,the retro Kolkata atmosphere demands a 10 on 10.

Looks and feels amazing, food average!
Almost everyone, especially a Kolkatan, who has seen or heard of the place has wanted to have food here. And my much anticipated visit with my friends happened to be a parting dinner treat for my veggie friend.
The entry beckons you with curiosity to step inside, and when you do your awed. Pure class and warmth by the looks and feel of it. The dark atmosphere is well matched by the subtle light from the lampshades, cosy enough to have some good time with loved ones. Seating comfortable.A look on the table as you are seated may disappoint you. I do feel the cutlery used(glasses,bowls,handkerchiefs) are quite old and needs a change. It just doesn't match up to all that's out of the table.

The order for 3 ppl was nonveg Chelo kebab for me and veg Grilled sizzler and Veg chelo for the others. A chelo or a sizzler is huge in quantity and both together can be shared easily by two. I was the lone nonveg, so had to be content with just the chelo. Coming to my nonveg chelo, the seekh kebab was excellent(lovely flavour of spices) but the chicken kebab was not upto the mark. It lacked some spice and had to be complimented by some lemon juice. The rice and egg simple. Although its their signature, it was satisfactory for us but nothing exemplary. The tandoori alu was the best in veg chelo. The sizzler was decent. The sauce poured over the kebabs was tasty. We just wish the sizzler was accompanied with its own rice. Would have been great then.

Service is prompt. Dishes are expertly explained and orders served well. The price is reasonable for Park Street. The ambience was overwhelming but the taste (though satisfactory) didn't live up to the hype. Other dishes to be tried soon...

Petercat- i hve heard a lot about it and decided for a lunch there with my wife.
Waited for more than 20 mins in queue outside. No reception or seats for waiting customers.
Staff is very unprofessional. They don't know how to converse with customers. They even have the guts to speak sternly with you even if asked about the late serving of the food stuff ordered.
We had decided upon chello kebabs..but the kebabs we had were simply pathetic, there are many restro which provide much better food than this junk petercat in less money.
Overall experience was not good.
Food - cold and not upto the mark.
Ambience- just okay types
Staff- unprofessional
Plates - very old and not properly washed
Handtowel was torn and wet already. Onion tumblers which laid for every dining customers were not washed for ages. The onions, pickles were not covered even attracting every bit of germ and dust of the brownian motion as it seems.
This was my first visit to this place which definately i wil make sure should be my last one too!!
Thanks.

One of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Located in the flamboyant area of Park Street, Peter Cat is the epitome of class. The restaurant has a beautiful ambience and visitors are hosted very well. 

The food is excellent in quality as well as quantity. The Chelo Kebab is just too yummy and perhaps the best in Kolkata. The Biriyani Ala Nawabi and Chicken Bharta are also good. The price is reasonable if not on the lower side. 

Enjoyed the lunch at Peter Cat. A nice and cozy place to have lunch or dinner with family and friends over chats.

I ordered Baked chicken which is a bit creamy and is not that great as well as the cold coffee with ice creme. Staffs are good and cordial.

Peter cat. Somehow it always has a queue whenever I visit. The decor is very much Continental infact it's pretty similar to mocambo which is also of the same owner. The settings are very intimate and cozy. Take a date and this place will do wonders . What I really like is the upstairs section , climbing up the staircase with the wooden railings. Now to the food. The menu cat resembles the place as it is of a cat most possibly named peter. If you come here, order sizzlers and then a chelo kebab. They make chelo kebabs like no other and it's one of their signature dishes. Try their keema nan too along with indian gravies. Just absolutely delicious. The service is fast and warm.  Must visit if you haven't yet. And the pocket pinch is high. But worth it.

I took my mother to this hugely popular restaurant on her birthday. While we had really a nice family time, having the food, the quality of which was really good and of course the ever loved chelo kebabs were there to satiate our taste buds, the ambiance, was in a really sad state. We had a real shortage of space to seat, and eating here, was only inconvenient because of that. Also the stewards dressed in the shabbiness of ancient clothes wasn't a pleasant sight however pleasant their service was. ¬†In an archetypal place like this, one should also take care to improve or at least to maintain the richness of the ambiance. Otherwise, it is always a delight to visit to this place for the food is simply blissful.

This is a legendary restaurant in Park Street known for its arrogant stuff, decent sizzlers and overhyped Chelo Kebab. Expect long queue, especially on weekends and some rude behavior from the stuff. Ambiance is pretty basic with dim lighting and comfortable seating.

I like the prawn cocktail here. Creamy and full of flavours. The Bloody Mary I ordered couldn't impress me. Badly made. The Chicken Sizzler was good. But their signature dish, Chelo Kebab, was a complete disaster. To begin with, this actually is a very simple dish. Buttered rice along with kebabs. Add to that grilled tomato and a fried egg. Hence, any restaurant serving good kebabs could make a great Chelo Kebab. Unfortunately, the best places for kebabs in this city don't have this item in their menu, and Peter Cat is not known for it's kebabs. The result is rice, topped with hard butter (another negative), and served along with an average chicken kebab and bad mutton sheek kebabs. The fried egg was overdone and too oily. 

If you must, visit this place for the prawn cocktail and sizzlers. Not the overhyped Chelo Kebab.

Any praise about this place will be a clich√©. Age old restaurant of park street, still got it's reputation intact. The ambience is superb. Their signature dish Chello kebab is a true savour for gourmets. Chicken marakesh and prawn cocktails are also must try dishes. One of my all time favourite restaurant. If you are a foodie and happen to be in Kolkata, this eatery should be a must visit.

If it's your first visit to Kolkata and your friends ask you to make sure that you don't miss Peter cat and to order chelo kebab there, pay heed to their advice. You'll enjoy the food there so much that you will tell other people to visit the place and make room for a meal there the next time they go to Kolkatta as well, at least I did. What are you waiting for?

Peter Cat, well known for it's Chelo Kabab. I feel this place is over hyped. The kabab were just average may be because I have had much better Kababs in places outside Kolkata. The service was also average. The interiors of the restaurant were too good and it's certainly a good hangout place in Park Street. Certainly, there are better places in Kolkata to go for when you are on a short visit.

Legendary does not necessarily mean good anymore. This restaurant proves the fact that old does not necessarily mean gold.¬†
Waited outside the restaurant for half an hour. finally went inside to sit at a table under the stairs with the lamp always hitting the head of the person even lifting himself an inch above the bench. Even the person serving us was hitting his head on the lamp. Seats were very claustrophobic and ¬†suffocating. But me and my friends still sat and waited for the food since it is supposed to be 'legendary'. Obviously ordered for their famous chelo kebabs which were so dry and dis-satisfactory that I thought maybe I should hit Kusum roll centre across the street for better quality food.
Ordered for some other starters and they were so slimy that upon asking he said even he didnt know what it was.
It is downright nonsensical place with behaviour of the staff so arrogant that it feels like they're the only ones selling food in park street.

Old is NOT old and please no need to visit this place again.

Whenever you go back to Kolkata, Peter Cat is always in your checklist. At list it remain in my checklist. Now to give a review for one of my favourite place i must say this is a place where you will get good food in very low price. Yes looking at the magnitude of the catchment area the place is cost effective till now. The service I'll say OK OK. 

Suggestions to the owners, these days rice quantity in chelo kabab got reduced. And the dish is must try for anyone visiting there for the 1st time.

Absolutely a not to miss!!!  The platter itself looked soo tempting..  With Kababs placed by the sides of buttered rice topped with an egg..  Would not mind visiting Kolkata only to have the Chelo Kababs at Peter Cat.

There is no doubt about their food quality, taste, ambience but  their staff's and waiters behaviour, boastful attitude is never reflected  that their restaurant deserves 4.2 or 4.3 star ratings but for that you have to be  in every aspects for deserve the same. Staffs and waiters asking in rude manner for keeping customers Debit or Credit card as a security when they are out temporarily at the door step for receiving guests or smoking inspite of having theirs belongings and foods inside and more over having a security and staffs at the gate. The way of treating with the customers by the staffs are very much unsatisfactory, disappointing, rude and overall not customer friendly from the entry to exit. If any one or unknown face customers come for dine they will never try and some times deny to assist and cooperate them in every aspects whether entry, sitting location, food choice etc. I have seen many times there are ample space inside  but they unnecessarily detained people outside by way of waiting only to expose their popularity. Friends now time has come to think before giving good ratings to this ill-mannered, non customer friendly,  restaurant.

It is generally a mixure of rice drowned with butter, and kebabs, sausages and poched egg on the top of it..

Looks like mess yet tasty.

Ordered reshmi kebab, which was upto the mark..

Ended with strawberry smoothy, not so overrated..

Decor and ambience is comfirtable..

Had been to this place, on an occasion of 4 college buddies "get-together", and we were ushered straight to the ground floor's end, which can be described as below -beside the staircase . ¬†Let's go to the food, rather than drinks

Ordered the Fish Fingers, Tandoori Mixed Grill, 2 plates Chelo Kebabs and Chicken Reshmi kebab

Fish Fingers - Pretty good, served with fries and mayo. Had never tasted the Fish Fingers in Peter cat before, so cannot say whether the taste has deteriorated or not

Chicken Reshmi Kebab - Ok. Nothing great about it. There was absolutely no juicyness in the meat. Full dry inside. Pretty obvious, that the meat had been cooked for a long time and kept over and over

Chelo Kebab - I wonder sometimes, what is the hype all about in this food. Rice is half cooked, covered in oil, and with another dollop of butter. Served with sides of grilled tomato, some salad, poached egg, seekh kebab and tandoor kebabs

Last but not the least, coming to the most "disgusting" food item in the list

Tandoor Mixed Grill - This food item has been listed under "Peter Cat's Sizzler Specalities". I Have eaten sizzlers at Kobe Sizzlers¬†, Yana Sizzlers, and some other places, but never in my life have I seen a "sizzler" covered in a "gooey" gravy, which is somewhat near to peanut sauce, but is not. And yes, neither does this sizzler come with any sides. No rice, no noodles

The last food item, just made the whole experience worst

Peter Cat! Or should I just say chello kebabs and let you guess the name? Either way. Had waited LONG enough to have their famed chello kebabs. So when the opportunity finally presented itself. I jumped, ran and did everything in between. Including wait. Because people who eat at peter cat know that they have to wait to eat in peter cat. [Can't book tables in advance :( ] Went there on a Friday night after office. Waited quite sometime to get in. Everyone else did too, so can't complain. We sat upstairs. The restaurant was dimly lit and beautifully decorated. We ordered the original chello kebab. Food was served not long after that. Don't remember the wait time because I was having such a good time acting like a tourist. Anyway, coming to the food. Firstly, the presentation is good and the taste is even better. Butter and rice. Delicious. And the kebabs. Yum!! Overall I was impressed with everything. Would definitely recommend it to all. One thing though, we felt the mutton kebab got dry very quickly. Maybe it's just us. Or maybe it's supposed to taste that way. Anyway, still good. üëç

Have you been there yet?

If not, you are missing out! Their signature dish ‚ÄúChelo Kebab‚Äù is just as famous as this restaurant. It‚Äôs sensational.

A restaurant so easy to locate, just ask anyone in Park Street and they will guide you there. It‚Äôs a dimly lit place with two floors of seating area, a little congested though. Be prepared to wait for a good 15 minutes at least before you get a seat. The place is almost always crowded. It‚Äôs gonna be worth the wait.

They have quite a lot to offer, however I always end up ordering either the Chelo Kebab or the House Special Chicken Steak Sizzlers. The Chelo Kebab is delightful which comes with buttered rice, Succulent kebabs, Poached egg, Mutton Seekh Kabab. The Sizzlers is equally amazing.

Pros:

* Food ‚Äì Delicious

* Service is quick

* Prices ‚Äì Decent

* Location is a big plus point

Cons:

* You‚Äôll have to wait a while before you get a seat

Dear readers ‚Äì Don‚Äôt surprise for my score. I know that Peter Cat is a very famous and lovely place to spend time with family and friends. Moreover the delicious foods are the center point of attraction.  The stuffs are also well behaved and the ambiance is very nice.

But, if a smoker wants to get outside to the restaurant premises to smoke ‚Äì then they have to deposit either Credit Card or Debit Card or something valuable with the waiter.

Now this was very embarrassing for me and while discussing the matter with the Restaurant Manager, he told us that after consuming liquor, some 7 to 8 individual group people left without paying the bill with the help of smoking excuse. So they started keeping cards of visiting guests those are going out from the restaurant for smoking. This is very insulting me as well as for those people who actually love Peter Cat and loyal in nature.

A legendary restaurant of Kolkata famous for their chelo kabab. Located on park street, this is one of the busiest restaurants I think! Visited it quite a few times, including tonight. I've tasted their chelo kabab and varieties of sizzlers, and they are all delicious! Although I have to mention that I've been recently disappointed with the chelo kabab. The sizzlers are a must try. I'll keep on going back to this place for more.

Nothing much needed to say about this awesome popular restaurant. I've been there on my birthday that was in may. We ordered chicken Marrakesh and chelo kabab.
The staff are very good and food is served well in time.
Coming to the dishes, the chelo kebab was soft and had an amazing taste.
On the other hand, the kebabs of chicken Marrakesh were a bit stiff and dry which were a bit of disappointment. But the awesome chelo kebab made up for it in every way.
Talking of the ambience, we were given seats in the small space created near the kitchen at the ground floor which was kind of congested and didn't like it much.
But then again, it's the food which simply made me forget everything else.
Overall the visit made my birthday a really tasty one.

Last Saturday, I went there with my husband. Yes, I had to wait long, but I knew what waited for me on the other side. We ordered Chelo Kabab, Chicken Marakesh, a cocktail¬† and two ¬†aerated drinks. Chelo Kababhe buttered rice, neatly poached eggs, and two variants of kebab makes your day. ¬†Even the Marrakesh was an absolute yum. We both were two full with a plateful of Chelo Kabab and Chicken¬†Marakesh each and did not have any space left for the dessert.
I love this place because of the food and the ambience- the dim lights, green and orange paper mats on tables, rose in the brass tumbler, hissing of the Sizzlers and staff dressed in pagri and pathani suit creates a magic. Hope to come back soon :-)

Good restaurant, good food.. But you have to be too lucky to get a direct entry here.. It's always queued up.... And the famous chello kebab of peter cat has deteriorated in taste. The rice is not served hot for which the butter doesn't melt easily and thus you don't get the flavour. Otherwise all good..

The famous chelo kebab deserves the award it hooted for but I felt its a bit overpriced.  May because the restaurant is now a brand and one of kolkata's finest.  That single platter is enough for a person , the chicken kebabs were a lil burnt than normal but the mutton kebabs were just melting in my mouth.

Well... We had to wait for 1.5 hours to get a seat.. Finally when the wait was over and we sat down to eat we ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka .. The tikkas were very tasty.. And I, being a vegetarian enjoyed the chicken kebabs üòÅ. The Kali dal was not tasty at all... But the over all food experience was good...

The ambiance steals the show. The well dressed waiters will present you with a menu but you know what you will order. Sizzler or The Famous, Chello Kabab! Two drinks that we ordered tasted absolutely delicious. The place is perfect for a date. It is so romantic that you are bound to fall in love with the restaurant. I heard 'hissss' every ten mins, which means the people love the Sizzlers so much. I ordered Chello Kabab. Buttered rice, with a poached egg on top. The chicken and mutton kababs ¬†were so good, that you are ruined for other restaurant's kababs forever. FOREVER. However, the stuffing that was given in between the chicken kababs were totally unnecessary. They are added to give volume. I was afraid I wont be able to finish the entire dish, but I gulped down till the last morsel.¬†

Peter Cat is one of the most famous restaurants in Kolkata and it was my first visit to this place. Let's directly come to the point.
Ambience is OK. There was too much noise from one of the tables which we expected the Manager to lower it down but nothing was taken care of and it was very disturbing. I hope for future the management will take care of it.
We ordered Chelo Kabab ( Original ) and HOUSE Chicken House Platter.

Chelo Kabab is one dish I had heard about a lot and even read it in online blogs. And this dish stands to its name with its quantity and quality. The only Drawback for me was the tomato wasn't grilled enough and it was raw from the other side. But overall a very good dish.

Coming to House Platter. House platter has Chicken strips, Chicken Sausages and Chicken Liver accompanied with Carrots and Peas. The sauce of the platter was very tasty. I definetely felt the raw carrots needed some kind of pickling like the peas.

Service was fast and waiters were responsive.
Peter Cat has its own name and it definetely stands upto it.

Thank You for a lovely lunch.

Standing in Park Street this is one of the prides that the city has to flaunt. The long ques in front of this place evidently shows the food it serves. We ordered veg and non veg chelo kebabs. The platters were full and hardly could any of us finish an entire plate. The mutton sizzler steak was rich in spices and absolutely delicious

After a long wait finally had the chance to visit this legendary place.  Almost lives upto its name. Ordered chelo kebab and when i asked the person taking our order to suggest a good sizzler, he was not very helpful. Ended up ordering roast chicken sizzler. Chelo kebab has minced mutton kebab( seekh kebab), chicken reshmi kebab, flavored rice generously topped with butter and poached egg. Roast chicken sizzler has one chicken breast n one leg roast. Chicken was so soft, it came off its bones with a slight touch of the fork. It was accompanied with potato wedges and boiled veggies. Overall happy with the main course. Then came dessert meringue with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. I was so happy to see we could add as much hot chocolate sauce as we want :p
As i dug into my dessert i found myself in heaven. That oddly shaped meringue had an amazing fluffy biscuity texture. Loved it!

I went there yesterday with my friend. It is one of the most famous restaurants of kolkata. We went around 5.30 and easily got a place to sit. The interiors were beautiful, especially because of the dim lights. We ordered house special chicken kabab and were told that it would take 15 minutes hearing which we accepted. But it took 40 minutes to arrive. They were too tasty for which i overlooked the extra time. Next we ordered chelo kabab, which lived up to its mark of being the best of this place, and tandoori roti and chicken reshmi butter masala, which were equally good. Lastly we took lime soda. The staff were nice and friendly. I wish to visit the place again. :)

Today our destination was Peter Cat, one of the most renowned restaurant in Park street. Starting from the entrance one can feel the aura of awesomeness that surrounds this place. Interior was nicely decorated with round table and hanging lamps.
We ordered the house special original Chello kebab and fresh lime soda. The chicken and mutton kebab melts in the mouth along with the buttered rice and creates a one of a kind sensation.
This dish is highly recommended if you are visiting peter cat.
Though the quantity of the rice should have been better considering the price. Next we tried tandoor mixed grilled sizzler which tasted just like a normal north Indian dish (nothing special).
Our friends also tried biryani which was worst of the lot.

Service is okay but be sure to give good amount of tip otherwise you may overhear some criticism.

Went there yesterday and I must say it is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. The chello kebabs, which the restaurant is famous for, were amazing. But, there was a little preferential treatment when we were outside waiting for our tables. Since we were 3 boys, and might I add dressed rather plainly, We had to wait a little longer than others. 3 groups of people, all who came after us were allowed to sit at the table before us even though they¬†had not reserved a table.¬†Other than that, The food was superb.

When ever I pass by this legendary eatery, I get to see a long queue outside the entrance.
A drizzling Sunday afternoon, we saw that the place was quite empty and hence decided to stop by.
We were given a nice and cozy place.
Ordered for a cocktail that had vodka as the base and pineapple juice. I loved this cocktail.
We order for a beer and was given chakhna in a large wooden bowl.
From food we ordered the famous chelo kebab and the fish makhmali kebab.
The fish makhmali kebab was fantastic.
The Bhetki was soft and melted in my mouth. They served a special sauted onion with it. It had a tangy taste and to enhance the flavours ajwain was used.
The chelo kebab was lip smacking as usual. The rice was long and fine. The kebab had all the right flavours. The sausages however could have been made a little bit succulent. I felt it was a bit over fried.

We ordered Chelo Kebab and Prawn cocktail. No doubt chelo was awesome and each herbs and spices blended with the kebab very well. But I was totally dissatisfied with the prawn cocktail I ordered. I have had that quite a few times. The prawns they gave were shrimps and the dish is supposed to be with jumbo prawns dipped in sauce while the tails coming out of it. But they made a shrimp soup out of it. The behaviour is the staff was not warm. They literally want to take the glasses and plates and as fast as possible get over with us. 
Not expected from such a reputed outlet.

This is one of the Heritage restaurants of Park Street and one of the more renowned names across Kolkata. While the food has always remained consistent the service was always a bit delayed, however that said there has been a considerable dip in the standards recently. We had ordered for the customary Chalo Kebab, Chef's special sizzler, a veg sizzler and some others. The food in total wasn't according the high standards the place sets for itself. We couldn't finish the drinks that we had ordered alongside. The memories and experiences at Peter Cat has always been very good for me, but this time I left with a bitter taste in mouth, so much so that I had to order a magnum from the nearby ice cream vendor to compensate.
Given the plethora of restaurants at Park Street I would have to deliberate whether to revisit anytime soon.

If you are visiting Kolkata, it is a place you should not miss. Peter CAT is synonymous with its chelo kebabs. So you have to order this. Chicken Marakesh and Steaks are also equally good. The ambience and staff service is quite good. Prefer the upper floor seating. There is always a 5-30 minutes waiting. Food and the experience is worth the wait though.

The front guy was bit of arrogant and behaving as if he is doing some favour to me by allowing me into the restaurant. We took seats in the 1st floor area. Food was served quickly for one item to delayed in one. Drinks were good. Both food punch and The Peter Cat cooler was indeed strong and tasty.

The wait seems very worthy when you enter the place and find a v.courteous staff as if you are their first customer of the day. The food is v. good specially the Chello Kebabs and Sizzlers. Two floor seating arrangement. Must must give a try.

I have got to review this place, even if it doesn't need one, only because I'm truly and genuinely proud that we have Peter cat adorning the restaurant scene in Cal. Their waiting is unending on all the days of the week, literally all the time. So, a pre booking is highly advised. Don't mind their dim lights and a marginally rustic look.. That's old Calcutta for you. This place has been same since our parents and grandparents would visit. That iconic menu card. Items that have not budged ever since. The stupendously famous chelo kebab platters. The sizzling hot and tasty sizzlers. Your glass of drink. Makes for a complete experience which is unforgettable. Love love love this place.

I love peter cat! Sometimes I specially go to kolkata to have their famous chello kebabs. Its a very old fine dining place. The ambience is quite different and amazing! All the attenders dress like Afghani men and the aura inside the restaurant too reflects the afghani culture.

I went there with my friend for lunch. I had my favourite chello kebab and my friend tried one chicken sizzler platter. The quantity of one chelo kebab platter was enough for two people. It is a combination of seekh kebab, reshmi kebab,rice filled with butter and an omelette on top. The chicken sizzler was fiery hot and very tasty too.

The prices are really reasonable and their service is commendable.

Its a must try place!

What this place is famous for?  Obviously we all know Chello kebabs.. And we went there for the same purpose. We initially heard alot of this dish and then we actually see we thought it won't be sufficient for our appetite. Then at the it's like i am full. Yet we ordered a mutton biryani which tastes also pretty good and in addition to it ordered a fresh lime soda wow what a taste it was. Only draw back they don't take phone reservations. And we have to wait yet we reached early because we were only boys

One of the most busiest restaurants in town. Whether be lunch, evening or dinner there is an eighty percent chance you will get a line queueing outside.
This place has a lot of memories attached for many people. 
The chelo kebab here is brilliant and is a must try. The kebabs are soft and tasty served on both sides of the rice. One side sheek kebabs and on the other sasliks complementing the buttered rice beautifully. Finally topped up by a lovely sunny side up egg and a whole tomato grilled.
The fried bhetki with tartare sauce, chicken cutlet and mix grill are also really good and worth a try.

Hey,
Firstly it's exact location : opposite KFC park street.
This place is one of the most famous places in Kolkata where people can wait for like two hours for the table so that they can just get an opportunity to have those delicious foods.
Ambience is appealing with dim lights. Serves the best kinds of dishes in best ways. Chelo kabab is the one which totally grabbed special attention. 
Always been favorite to Bengalis and the best feeling in here is when m with my bong friends.
Loved this place a lot.
Great service and staff courtesy cause you wont be left alone anytime.
A place where you won't be satisfied even after going a thousand times .

Oh how long I have waited for this. Me and peter cat go way back. I still remember those times when my dad used to take me here when I was just a kid. In those days park street meant peter cat, barbq and trincas. So, finally when me and my friends decided to go there on a lazy Saturday afternoon I was damn excited.
The queue was pretty long as expected but we didn't have to wait long. Like 20-25mins which I guess is kind of expectable.
The moment is stepped in all those memories kept flooding in. The beautiful ambience, the food.
But, then things went horribly wrong.
 We ordered a couple of JW and beers and that took 20mins to deliver while we just sat there. Nothing to do. The food came 45mins late. 45 mins... Are you friggin kiddin me???
The taste wasn't that great as I remembered and it was okish.
I called the waiters 6-7 times asking for a water refill before I finally got it.
The bill delivering service was fast however.
The only good thing is it isn't too heavy on your pocket.

One of the finest restaurants in Kolkata which serves mouth watering chelo kebabs. Though it was good at taste,i feel its kind of losing it originality and mostly goes by name currently. Staffs themselves were confused about the availability of the peter cat specials. Giving it a 4 rating only for those CHELOS. üòâ

There are some authenticate restaurant present in Kolkata which doesn‚Äôt need any kinda intro, Peter Cat is a such kinda restaurant that doesn‚Äôt need any kinda intro.

Located at Park Street near Flury‚Äôs, very easy to find. We didn‚Äôt get any kinda trouble to find this restaurant.

Ambiance is super traditional, almost dark inside and hanging lamp on table makes this place a perfect place for dining with family or your special one. There is two floor there for sitting. Very neat and clean and no question is left to its hygiene level.

Well now come to food,.Peter Cat is famous for its Signature Chelo Kabab and Sizzler and we order the same.

Chelo kabab: In one word, it is awesome. Super fine rice served with an egg omelet, butter scoop on the top of rice, sausages and kabab obviously make this dish one of the best Chelo Kabab of town. Super juiciness of this item can‚Äôt be felt unless you try this, Super recommended!

Chicken Steak Sizzler: Comes in a wooden plate and lettuce leaf on the base and the sizzler is placed on it. Served with gravy potato, egg on top and some steamed vegetables like beans, carrot etc, Damn tasty and the chicken is really out of world, this is also highly recommended too.

Price was a little high obviously, with two dishes and two lemon soda it cost around 900INR, which is fair enough I think with respect to food they offered. Overall a good dining experience we had.

Yesterday went with friends for dinner...
For starters we ordered Fish Makhmali and Mutton Sheekh kebab...
Fish Makhmali tasted just as its name...such soft texture and terribly yummy...
Main course consisted of Tandoor Mixed Sizzler which consisted of 1 pc prawn, 2 pc of chicken, 1 pc mutton, half an egg and salads
Now comes my most favourite part The Dessert
We ordered Brownie with Vanilla Icecream and Choco Sauce and Meringue with Vanilla Icecream and Choco Sauce...trust me please please try the Meringue one...It's just heaven I tell you...
Good service
Good ambience
And a little note before I end please make sure you reach the place by 7pm or 7.30pm for dinner cuz it's a place worth getting crowded ‚ò∫

One of the finest restaurants in Kolkata, this. You cannot get your foodie list completely ticked off without visiting here. As of the ambience, I would suggest to choose the upstairs as it is prettier. The food is undoubtedly finger licking good with the perfect mix of flavours and ingredients. Chelo Kebabs that what this place is famous for but I would recommend to try out Chicken Marakesh. The kebabs of this dish is way better than that of the Chelo Kebab platter. I would not really suggest to try out desserts here as they are not at all upto the mark. Overall, if you're here at Kolkata do drop in here.

From the crossing of Mirza Ghalib Street towards St. Thomas Church on the right side opposite KFC lies Peter Cat. Whenever you go you are always in a que to enter this prestigious restaurant. Below Stephen court this old building restructured but keeping the same essence of British era. 2 floors with wooden stairs big hall size restaurant. Dim lights. This restaurant is famous for it's sizzlers and Chelo kebab. Chelo kebab is the signature dish here it contains baked tomatoes with 2 kind of kebabs. A small amount of butter rice with a poached egg. Deliciously presented on a single plate. This dish is light but filling costs around 400 including tax. Have it for dinner or lunch it equally tastes good. We went for a lunch started with 2 cocktails one of whiskey another of white rum. With some snacks and fish makhmali kebab. The fish was original Bhetki and it was cooked to perfection. Then we ordered chicken stake sizzler and Chelo kebab. Sizzlers here r generally served with cabbage leaves, boiled potatoes, boiled beans & carrots with chicken or mutton whatever you want and all these mixed in creamy soya sauce. Cooking is good but I felt it tasted better before, may b the chefs got changed. Service was bit slow but that can be excused. But everything else is fine. For first timers these dishes will be heavenly but those who tasted before may find it bit disappointing. Rates r bit high so keep ur pockets ready. Must come place for foodies.

Peter Cat has been the quintessential dinner destination for the 'Shaheb at heart' Bangalis and for good reasons too. The place offered the best and only chello kebabs in town teamed with beautiful spicy north Indian dishes  and the most lavish continental spread. While the nostalgia connected to this place still soars, the charm of the food is on a slow yet steady dip. 

All that been said and putting aside my recent disappointment with the mutton chello kebab platter, there are some pretty good dishes on the menu still that do not fail to impress. Some of these dishes are- nalli gosht, fish makhmali, chicken irani, fried bhetki with tartare sauce, and the fish meunier. Do  try them on your next visit. The service remains prompt and proper.

Have heard and seen so much about Peter Cat and it's culture on social websites that our group decided to give this a visit.

We decided to strategically visit it on a fine Tuesday afternoon (around 1pm) to avoid standing in a queue to just get a table there . We were lucky even though by the time we finished (around 3pm) a noticeable amount of people lined up outside to eat.

Anyway, the restaurant has two floors and it's really really dimly lit. I can assure you, for newbies , that ambience has a class of it's own. The staff is sharp and to point as they don't want us to fiddle with the menu much. The waiters are all dressed up with ethnic wear of some sort.

Moving on to food. Dishes are served from moderate to "the starters have digested" delays and I suggest you order proper salads and starters to keep you occupied (along with drinks) while they cook your main course.

We ordered Tandoori Chicken, A Grilled Chicken and well the Chelo Kebabs. This was my first try at the authentic original kebabs and boy It lived upto the hype.

The food was excellent and I loved it. As a matter of fact the dishes aren't even that costly either. My suggestion would be to order a Chelo Kebab and something along with it.

I am really happy with the place. Definitely would love to visit over and over again.

Finally a visit to this legendary restaurant for a Sunday lunch with my partner(in crime). Be sure to take your time as you will end up in the waiting queue for 1-2hr.We had the signature chello kebab and the tandoori mix grill sizzler. The chello tasted heavenly and worth the waiting up in queue.The tandoori mix sizzler was also good.
Waiters were helpful and the ambience was also decent with spacious sitting arrangements.
Overall an awesome experience. 
If you are in kolkata do give it a shot.

And the Cat got me! 
Snooked away in the rustic old charms and surroundings of Old Calcutta in the scenic Park Street area,it does impress you especially if you are one of those admirers of old world charm and nostalgia.
Even the waiting in the queue outside is something to relish and the wait is Worth it.For the first timers Chelo Kebabs with Beer.
Veg Sizzler is tasty too.Dimly lit ,it does a great job at giving you your own space amidst a crowd of foodies.
 A must visit for foodies.
 A must visit for outstation tourists.
And definitely a must for me again.

For the vegetarians: 
I've visited this place quite a lot of times but never really ventured out of the safe veg Chello kabab order. As a vegetarian I was quite unsure about how the veg steak sizzler was going to be. I was almost 100% certain that it was going to be a disappointment buy surprisingly, it wasn't. So if you are still unsure about whether to order the veg steak, I recommend going with a moderately large group of people so that you can order whatever you want to order and then share that veg steak amongst yourselves. Peter Cat is dependable and consistent if not anything else.  A perfect spot for a Sunday family lunch.

'Peter Cat' is a name associated with Bengali heritage. Every time I visited Park Street, I have observed a long queue outside the restaurant. However for me the dining experience was a bit let down.

Apart from the heritage decor I do not have much to cherish about. Service was lousy. The broccoli was under cooked. The famous so famous 'Chelo Kabab' was good but not great. The other items I was nice. So I cannot rate this restaurant poor. 

Perhaps next time it would be better if there is a next time at all. But for sure I want to taste the sizzlers.

This was my 3rd visit to this place and it never fails to impress me.this place has got a old kolkata type feel.there is always a massive queue outside this restaurant irrespective of whether its sunday ,monday or any other day of the week or there is a hailstorm, thunderstormüòÇ!so opt for this place only if you are ready to sacrifice 2 3 hrs of your life just waiting outside peter cat.but the legendary chelo kebab of this place is worth the wait.plus we had fish makhmali which was heavenly.it was melting the moment you put it in the mouth.for desserts we had chocolate nut sunday,tutti frutti and mango souffle.mango souffle was the best of the lot and the others were pretty decent.
P.s. if you are in kolkata atleast once you should visit this place.

Visited here during my short holidays in kolkata after a long time. We had Tandoori mixed grill sizzler and the legendary chelo kabab with Peter Cat's cooler to beat the heat. Peter cat cooler was rum based cocktail mixed with whiskey and orange juice. 
One should try the epic chelo kabab at peter cat. It is one of their signature dish. Its a variety of persian cuisine contains sausage, kababs, rice buttet and omelette!
The tandoori sizzler was good to taste.
Visit this place cause it is one of the pride of kolkata.

Was starving after a long day and went in for a lupper in the evening. Service was great and the food was just like nectar to our hungry tongues. Ordered the famed Chelo Kabab and the mixed Tandoori platter. I guess I did a mistake by eating first the Tandooris, the variety of which appeased the full range of my taste buds and so, the Chelo Kabab seemed mellow in comparison.. Nevertheless thoroughly satisfied with the whirlwhind of a meal for the gustatory senses. :)
. 5 deducted from the experience coz the seating position near the entrance was a bit unsettling.

This is an iconic and legendary restaurant that almost defines Kolkata! 
Decided to have my birthday lunch here and it was sooooo good. Have visited this place many times before, mainly for their chelo kebab platter. 
Well it's a given - if it's peter cat, it has to be chelo and vice versa. This place has an old world charm which makes it one of the most sought after restaurants in Kolkata and also one of my favourites!

Now coming to the food. We ordered :
‚Ä¢ Fresh lime soda
‚Ä¢ Chelo Kebab
‚Ä¢ Tandoori Grilled sizzler. 
The chelo kebab needs no introduction and the tandoori grilled sizzler was mixed platter containing grilled chicken, prawns, fish, chicken liver and kakori kebabs. *droools*
The food was amazing as usual, and my birthday was absolutely made! :D

Pocket pinch - 1456.
Always coming back for more chelo! :P

One of the most popular restaurants in Park Street which always has a queue of the waiting diners in front of the entrance, round the year. The decor and service are fine. The menu is within the pocket pinch, both for food and alcohol.

Have been a fan of this place for a very long time. The food quality however have deteriorated to some extent in the recent times. Chelo kebabs, the signature dish of Peter Cat, is not  up to the mark, these days. The mutton sheikhs are a bit too dry and smells of green coriander. The second most popular dish, tandoori mixed grill sizzler contains too much of liver on the platter. The items that are still lip smacking good are the cocktail sausages and the hamburger steak.

I really wish this place comes back to It's full glory so that I can rate it 4.5/5. As of now, it's a 3.5/5

This heritage of Calcutta has probably been in wish list of every foodie living and visiting Calcutta and for all the right reasons....located in the very heart of Park Street.....this restaurant has been the mixing bowl of European sophistication with Persian deliciousness... Went there with 3 of my friends...
Ambience: Great lighting,decor...sitting arrangement seemed a bit crowded but you can forgive that considering its popularity

Food-we ordered 2 of their popular dishes dishes...their signature dish Chelo Kebab and Raan ki Dan.
Chelo kebab is a platter comprising 2 varieties of kebab and rice with butter cubes and poached egg...simple, light ,yet delicious... though I feel the rice should have been warmer...
Now about Raan ki Dan..consuming 1 spoonful of this delicacy was like attaining Nirvana...it's basically a dish of minced meat with fine balance of Persian spices...deliciousness at its best..
Staff: Polite,courteous and ready to help out with the menu and choices...
Pocket Pinch: On the higher side but the food and ambience makes up for it...
This restaurant has been serving the Eurasian flavours to Calcutta since the British Raj...though many elders tell the quality has become somewhat low....but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience...looking forward for my next visit and more dishes to try...definitely worth a go..

The ambience is amazing. Not very home-like,but definitely welcomingüòÉ
Food is sumptuous, otherwise I wouldn't be writing thisüòâ
I always like to start with kebabs. Then follow it up with Dum ki rang and Baked chicken.
Then finish off with the classic Chelo kebab and a dessert.
Or, you can alternatively order a sizzler! They cook it soooo goodüòç
Then finish off with the Chelo. It is a must, for me at leastüòâ
Now you find your combinationüòÉ
No complaints regarding the service and all. They are all very nice and also help you to give you a fair idea of what you should order!

One of the legendary restaurant in kolkata. I think every foodie had been to this place. It is located in the heart of park street, so no wonder its gonna be costly. You have to wait outside, if you go there on a weekend. Waiters are very polite and attentive. Dress code of the waiters remind of vintage CALCUTTA. Loved chicken steak sizzler and one n only Chello Kebab. The kebabs were well cooked and everything were so nicely prepared. Ambiance, food and service all are good.
Do visit this place and do try out the Chello Kebab (because it is famous) ‚ù§Ô∏è

The ambience is really good as you will find Dim light surrounded everywhere with an Orange Gradient wall . The atmosphere is perfect for dining. But, there is lot to say of its Cons side . Firstly, I didnt like the system of waiting outside with my parents who are quiet Old . Alright, I do understand that there is not enough space inside but, atleast you could have arranged some seats outside . Its a Family restaurant , so its expected elderly people would be coming there . Secondly, we had ordered Chello kababs and Chicken Sizzlers . None of us liked the taste of chello kabab . I had been here earlier , this dish was far better then . I was disappointed with everything . Thirldy, few of the staffs were friendly but some of them seemed quite distracted . We called someone to give us a glass of Jaljeera Juice , he took the order and then nobody turned up . We waited for around 15mins for that , then we were forced to Cancel the order .

I have been visiting Peter Cat for years now but the quality of food has gone down tremendously. We were served cold kebabs and when we complained about it, they heated the same in yhe microwave and got it back to our table. Moreover the waiters are very rude.
We even made complains to the manager about the behavior of the waiters a couple of times but there has been no improvement.
Its not the same Peter Cat anymore.
But i will still visit the restaurant only for the 
" Dum ki Raan" and the "Brownie with ice cream and Chocolate Sause".

When you mention Park Street, a cherubic smile lights up most people‚Äôs‚Äô faces. It is synonymous to Peter Cat and an afternoon/evening of lip-smacking food extravaganza. Whether it‚Äôs lunch or dinner, Peter Cat has been flocked by Calcuttans ‚Äì old and young, emigrant and resident Bengalis and innumerable tourists visiting the city. Our memories have been synced to Park Street by the mention of this restaurant. We‚Äôve had NRIs doing a touchdown here as a part of their annual pilgrimage to Calcutta. Being such a favourite, Peter Cat rules Park Street and our hearts. Read why on my blog.

So, after hearing a lot about this place I visited it a couple of days ago. 
We ordered chello kebabs and a tandoori mixed grill sizzler. While the ambience and the service was really very good. I was unfazed by the food which is so much hyped. 
The chello kebab which is supposed to be the speciality isn't out of the world amazing. It's good but coming at a price of 345 + handsome amount of taxes you expect more qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Same goes for the sizzlers. 

Overall I found this place having a good ambience and service but lacking value for money. There are better places to eat in the vicinity I'd say.

It takes herculean effort to make a dish consistently for a decade or more.. And to top it if it's Chello kebabs of Peter cat.. You can vouch to not be disappointed.  Same succulent pieces and mild flavors.. Light as feather of tummy (despite being filling).. This one is a all time savior for taste buds.

Just because its an old legacy place doesn't give this restaurant the right to make its customers wait for 2 hours standing outside in a small place.

Worst service. Worst attitude. 

Never ever go to this place. There are lots better place in Kolkata now. 

The good food doesn't make up for the attitude and service provided by this place.

Never. Ever. Again.

This was my third visit to the place, couldn't be seated on the first floor which is always better ambience wise. Had the chelo kebab and house special sizzler. This is a restaurant that has proved itself trough ages but on my third visit found the quality of chelo kebab deteriorate. The sizzler was on point. Service was on par except for I didn't get provided with the WiFi password on asking. All in all peter cat lives upto it's spirit if not quality.

If you're are from Calcutta, then this must be in the list of your favourite restaurants. But it is not only limited to Calcutta, the glory of this restaurant is spread all over the country, whenever anyone visits Calcutta, a visit to Peter Cat is a must, the Chelo Kebab is one of their signature dishes. Chelo Kebab is a complete meal itself deliciously constituting of warm rice topped with butter and an egg poach, a set of chicken reshmi kebab, two sticks of shami kebab and salad. If you've not tried it, then you should do it at teh soonest.

Excellent ambience and warm reception poisoned with the special chello kabab and sizzler.They serve the sizzler on a wooden bone plate with a sizling sound.And this is probably the best delicacy you will find in kolkata.

Once upon a time , if peter cat doesnt want its tagline to change from always the best.
waiting time at peter cat is another reason to always think twice before heading here.

Why then go for peter cat , why. The answer needs to be simple yummy food. You would find everything from the old days. Cutlery , waiters uniform but talking about food it has taken new strides towards becoming pale shadow of its past.
Coming to food ,
We had simple cocktail john collins , it tasted very near to frsh lime soda.
The saver was the simplest of the starter chicken tandoori , very nicely done tandoor , marination near to perfect.
Next our very own, chelo kabab. On of the dish which made peter cat what it is, would surely be losing its way out of diners plate soon. The mutton kabab was so bad , was hard no taste, the plating had one half baked tomato and another sliced tomato. 
It made me avoid placing order for another sizzler. 
This place has been always my favourites but dont know who going to bell the cat to get its work together.
Its for all the food lovers to decide....

There is a reason why some places are legendary and remain so for ages. Peter Cat is one such exalted place and the reason becomes quite evident once a person dines over here. 
Fridays and weekends are naturally busy business days for restaurants, more so for this place and one needs to be prepared for a long wait outside. We weren't, and after a wait of almost an hour, our family of six finally occupied the farthest corner table for dinner last Friday night. 

Firstly we ordered our drinks with Nalli Gosht Dry as the starter. We ordered for two Pineapple Blossoms, while two of us had the Planter's Punch and another two had a cocktail of pineapple juice and vodka (the name of which I forgot). The pineapple blossom was the best I have ever tasted. It was extremely smooth without the sting from the pineapple and tasted heavenly. The planter's punch had orange, pineapple, lemon and dark rum in it. This concoction was a nice and subtle blend of multiple flavors and felt pretty refreshing. The pineapple vodka was extremely light with just the right amount of a fruity undertone. 

The plate of Nalli Gosht had two huge leg-pieces of mutton, with the nicely marinated meat being extremely soft and juicy. 
For the mains, our group was divided between Chelo Kebab and the Bhetki Muniere. The chelo kebab platter had the most deliciously made rice which had the slightest hint of clove and exuberantly exuded the flavor of butter. I liked the softer chicken kebabs better than the mutton ones. 
What won my heart was the Bhetki Muniere. Starting from the boiled carrots and beans to the exquisite texture of the fish, it was a dish made in heaven. The flesh is soft, buttery and melts as soon as you put it in your mouth. The white sauce with herbs had a well balanced seasoning but isn't too rich. The potatoes however felt unimportant and lacked in taste, and seemed to be not at par with the rest of the dish.

Quality and quantity of food deserves to be lauded over and over again. Service was highly commendable and the person who took our orders helped us in choosing our drinks and starter wisely. 
This is definitely a place made for revisits and mulling over the aftertaste left by their food long into the night. :)

One of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata, this place is as popular as it gets. They don't have a reservation facility and have crowds piling up, but everyone is willing to wait, because the food in Peter cat is worth the wait. Service is prompt (it has to be considering the crowd they have to cater to). On this particular occasion I ordered tandoori chicken and their famous chello kebab. The pieces of chicken were soft, succulent, and the mutton was as tasty as it gets. What's even more wonderful is the generous blob of butter which they add. If you're in the mood for good food (read sizzlers and chello kebab), and you don't mind waiting for it, Peter cat is the place to be.

Planning for your first date? Or wanna take your family out for a wonderful evening..or just wanna hang out with your friends, grab a couple of beers and enjoy a meal..whichever it is just visit PETER CAT.
One of my favourite restaurant.. The ambience..the service..the food..an all in one package.. the last time i visited..i had the ''prawn cocktail'' the '' mixed sizzler platter'' and the all famous, the PROTAGONIST,  of the restaurant, ''chelo kebab''...i...i...i can stil smell the kebabs.
P.S.- (+18) buy a beer if you are taking the sizzler...you won't regret the desicion.. ;)

  Nd lastly desert..'' choco chip ice cream'',.need i say more? ahhh..you can guess the amount of delightness.  And it doesn't puts a hole in your wallet also..reasonable ,yet out standing... 
The only drawback is the queue outside..you have to wait  atleast half an hour on a sunday..but it's worth waiting...

The most heritage resto in the city is petercat. The ambience for me is quite romantic. I'll suggest to all love birds to come over here to have a romantic dinner. Evey time i visit there is always a queue outside the resto. But i dont mind coz widn 5mins i always get a table. I always order one item which it is famous for, original chelo kabab. I cant get enough of it. The buttery rice, spicy galauti kabab, shikh kabab, egg poch and some salad are perfect and well balanced combo meal for one. Though sometimes i get an egg omlete or else sunny side up. I dont care coz i love everything about it.

I had given this place 5 stars few years back on Zomato. Today I have to strip it down to 2 stars only...
Food is okay... Chelo continues to be good but it isn't extraordinary anymore. I guess it goes only by name these days.
Service is terribly poor. For a restaurant that boasts of being one of the best in kolkata, service level is a big disappointment. I had asked for the Muniere for starter. And since I wanted to try our the sizzler in Peter Cat, so I asked for  grilled fish. But the waiter never told us that both the dishes are 90% same except that the sizzler comes with a sizzling pan. Now I would expect the waiter to guide his customers while talk order. It felt like I ate the same dish for starters and main course. How stupid can this be...
Then I asked for some warm water for my sore throat. And I had to continue asking 4 times till it finally came. And it wasn't warm. It was hot. For a restaurant, they should know the difference between hot, warm and lukewarm...
And finally, during billing, they ignored giving us the mouth freshner. I had to finally ask for it.
So finally, thumbs down to Peter Cat.

This is a place where people visit religiously and regularly. A queue is always there outside. The restaurant is dimly lit. The mutton kebab of the chelo kebab is overpowered with cinnamon powder. At least I felt so. The chicken kebabs are soft and tender. The cream of chicken soup is good and gives ¬†sore throat a soothing feeling. The sizzler is good and the mains fill you up so ordering something else is out of the question. Especially if you are going for the continental dishes.

Hadn't been a fan for a while because it seemed their sizzlers had fallen from grace.
But since this place is a favourite from childhood, we gave it another try yesterday.
To my great relief, the food seemed much better. And the service was commendable.
We took a house special & a chicken steak sizzler (with bread rolls), chello kebab and chilli chicken along with a dew drinks.
It cost us around 2200. Ah! Park street!
 Although, I still think I had better sizzler in Peter Cat, yet it has brought my faith back. So, that's a win I guess.

Truly a legendary restaurant in the city. 

The food here is one of a kind (no matter where u eat the mutton or chicken chelo kebab, here its the best). 

The prawn cocktail was unexpectedly good and heavy. I knew it would be good but not that much. 
The chelo kebab quantity left me a bit unsatisfied. (i mean cmon, i ate a prawn cocktail before the chelo kebab but i felt like i wasnt full so had to make do with water and im a medium eater). 

And they need a valet very badly.. Parking in that area is not easy at all unless u get lucky.

Finally got the chance to visit the most renowned and heritage restaurant of Kolkata Peter Cat last Saturday after trying couple of times. The place with the shades of dim orange light just flabbergasted me. One will always get oneself in the queue while visiting Peter Cat which is worth waiting. 
Coming to the food the most and obvious dish to order was Chelo kabab. It is the restaurant special dish. It consists of both chicken and mutton kababs with 3/4 cubes of butter as toppings on rice and an omelette. Along with it we took Chicken Marakesh, Mutton Nawabi and Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler. All the dishes were unique and delicious in their own way.
We opted for Vanilla ice cream with Hot chocolate sauce in desserts which was also good.
Love the place love the ambience and overall love the food. Will surely visit it soon.

Dining at Peter Cat and having Chelo Kabab is an activity ,all Calcuttans particularly Bengalees consider as essential as going to Kalighat Temple after an interval of few months, only the persons change, from one generation to another and one occasion to another .As an avid foodie, again visited the restaurant last Sunday after duly taking the trouble of queuing for solid 45 minutes. But, the reason for writing the review is that the famous chelo kabab has retained its original flavour and taste which is unparallel and I must say that the 'wait' was very worthwhile. My thanks to the restaurant authority for gifting this unique wholesome food to the Calcuttans for a very reasonable price. And a request, they may think of opening branch in other parts of the city as well......

Somehow. I do not get the craze about Peter Cat. Though I agree that it s a heritage restaurant and it has a lot of history to offer, i still do not get waiting in line for 30-45mins just to get in. The food is good, but not mind blowing. The interiors are sober and classy. The Chelo Kabab that all of Kolkata drools over is undoubtedly delicious, but not drool worthy. I frankly do not understand what is all that great about buttered rice and kababs. Moreover the kababs are not that great either. Their another specialty are the sizzlers. I agree that the sizzlers taste really yummy and are one of the best that the city has to offer. The staff are bossy, well I understand that because that's the culture of Park Street(the retro charm). 

Try this place not because of anything else, but because this place has shaped kolkata and its restaurant culture; try this place for its history; try this place for its shear brand value.

For years, I had seen the huge line in front of Peter Cat and had wondered how brilliant their food would have been which had caused the masses to line-up and wait for hours at a stretch to just eat. History knows somehow, whenever my friends and I planned to dine there, we never got seats. So, finally after an entire week of planning, I went to Peter Cat for the first time on Sunday, 5th June with my brother and sister-in-law. All 3 of us are huge foodies and went there to experience some great food that had made Peter Cat what it is today. However, little did we know that awaiting us was an array of bad experiences waiting to happen. And all of it boiled down to one simple fact - EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE.

First of all, they would not let enter until the other 2 members of our group arrived. Neither would they give us a 3-seater nor a 5-seater, even when the place was semi-empty and both seating options were readily available. However, once we finally got in, the real fun started.

We had ordered their famous Chelo Kabab and the egg poach in mine had egg shells in it. So, quite a few times when I chewed, I felt the crunch of the shells (imagine my horror). Also, my sister-in-law found a chilli stem on her plate. We had also ordered the Today's Special Chicken Kabab and honestly this one tasted beter than the Chelo kabab. However, the special kabab dish had a hair in it which we only discovered after taking the last piece off the plate. Now imagine the amount of disgust that we felt knowing that we just ate an entire plate of kabab which had a hair in it. This was the last straw as we had lost all patience and hence we finally complained to the manager, who to my utter disbelieve did nothing at all.

So, basically by the end of the night, we had got a lot more than we had asked for including egg shells, a chilli stem, a hair, very bad service and an even worse experience. In complete honesty, I did not understand what the hype about Peter Cat was all about. I don't think I would like to re-visit anytime soon as I had left the place feeling utterly dis-satisfied and disgruntled.

Food is just awesome... Must try Chelo Kebab the in-house speciality. Its a famous kebab platter with rice,butter and half poached eggs on top of it. Just yummy... Also try out their sizzler mixed grill. You will just love it. Beers are served in Copper Glasses... Feel good factor üëåüèªüëåüèª

The ambience is just awesome when I visited first time. I went with my gf for the first date so it was special. And Peter Cat menus were the icing on the cake. Had to wait for an hour almost at 2pm on weekday. So its very clear about the popularity. For me it was Chelo kabab as we know the yummiest item. I just loved it. If you are a foodie never miss Peter Cat.

This is the place where I have gave a try for more than 7 times and could not enter just because of the queue..¬†
Finally I was determined to control my hunger and made it here. Being lucky it was a heavy rain day and We got a table for two within a 10 mins time. The ambiance of this legendary place and the food deserves the wait.

We took famous chello kabab which was indeed one of its kind over here.¬†
Also went for their "chefs recommendation for fickle minded". we got soup and steak. I love steak so I was like "how could they even know??"
food quality?? In short too good.

Finally got a chance to visit the famous PETER CAT(All thanks to my dear Sona-The Explorer & positive reviews from Zomato) & try their Speciality 'Chelo Kababs'.
Ambiance : 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Value for money : 3/5
The seekh kababs were good but the tandoori @kababs were a bit dry & hard for me,since i love my chicken a bit smoky & Juicy.Rice with loads of butter & poached egg was good but the taste of butter overshadowed everything.
The only Con is the waiting time...a good 40-45 minutes...but i guess thats a great strategy since a long wait only adds to an increased appetite.
Overall it was good...highly recommended.

Peter Cat had been on my 'have to go there' list for a long, long time. And everytime I would plan a visit to the legendary Park Street restaurant, something would happen and the plan won't materialise. Anyway finally I managed to go to PC recently. Firstly, the location is so amazing. I have always loved Park Street and have been to other places like Mocambo and flurrys numerous times. However nothing compares to the fan following of PCs chelo kebab. This dish is the national dish of Iran and comprises rice along with dollops of butter, two kinds of kababs and omelette. The dish is a meal in itself. I loved the rice and the flavour of the Persian herbs. We also ordered a chicken steak sizzler and screwdrivers to go with the food. The sizzler pretty good too, the steak very soft and juicy. A great experience. For people who go there for the first time, do order the chelo kabab. You won't be disappointed.

This review is going to be based on my personal choice and working of flavour combination. Ergo, please do not entirely take into account my critical analysis of THE CHELLO KEBAB. Peter Cat has been around since ages, and most people have a different understanding and likeability towards certain type of food and sadly enough, Peter Cat did not do that for me.

This restaurant is located opposite to the lane of The Park hotel. You enter the lane, and on your right you will find your destination.

Coming to the food, obviously Chello Kebab was the choice of the hour given its popular reputation. 
            This dish is constructed of chicken, egg and mutton, in terms of protein. They serve you two big pieces of mutton kebab and six hot pieces of chicken kebab. The poultry was nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, in my personal opinion it lacked a of kick to it. The mutton pieces were alright.
              The poultry is complemented with capsicum and roasted onion in between. It was also served with a half piece of raw tomato. I do not remember any seasoning on that. So, that was a disappointment.
                They topped the dishes of with a beautifully done poached egg on plain rice. The egg was good, but lacked salt and pepper. Rice was ordinary. And they served this with cubes of butter that failed to melt on the rice, because it was not hot enough (as you can see in the picture below).

Management: Peter Cat as I have always seen is packed with people, weekdays or weekends. The staff in that perspective, manage everything impressively. Service is average. Restaurant is kept more or less clean. It is also easy on the pocket!

The legendary Peter Cat. One of the wonders of this city , a visit to Kolkata is incomplete without dropping in at this culinary paradise. Situated at the crossing of Park Street and Middleton Street , there is a perpetual queue outside this place whether its noon or night. The decor is slightly colonial , with the dark wood panelling and the low orange lamps giving a pseudo-romantic feel.¬†

The food is , to put it blandly , fabulous. In my opinion , the Cello Kebab served here is the zenith of food pleasure. Rice topped with butter and egg, along with Chicken Tikka Kebab and Mutton Seekh Kebab -- damn, my mouth is watering as I write this. Also renowned for its Sizzlers ,which I find slightly below par , Peter Cat offers a wide range of Continental high-class dishes. Beckty Munierre is a succulent preparation of fish that will tickle your taste buds pleasurably. For starters,the ¬†Prawn Cocktail is an absolute delight. Add to that the well-behaved staff and prompt service ; and you have a winner on your hands. Here's to many more wonderful meals at PC :)

Peter Cat is located at the heart of Park Street... But whether it is weekend or weekdays, you will never find this place without queue in front... We went there for lunch and had to wait for 30 minutes untill we got our table... though the ambience was worth watching... the two floors of sitting with nice decor and the dim light will definitely give you a luxury feeling... We ordered
Virgin Mary
Chelo Kebab (original)
Beckty Meunier
Peter Cat's Special Dessert

Chelo Kebab had chicken kebabs, mutton seekh kebabs, veggies, Rice with butter and the whole dish was tasty ...this is one of the signature items of peter cat...
Beckty Meunier literally won my heart... probably the best dish for me... it had soft fish pieces with mayonnaise on top and served with veggies... the dish was too scrumptious...
Virgin Mary was sort of tomato juice... may be healthy but not so good in taste...
And the peter cat special dessert was a really special one... it has three layers (chocolate and wafers on top, then tutti frutti in middle, and strawberry-vanila ice cream with choco chips in bottom)... it was yummy...
Service was fast...
I just have one complaint and that is about waiters... I don't wanna generalise this but I am just saying what I felt... no doubt management clearly takes care about the appearance of the waiters ... but I found the waiter who served us that day (1st june) was not so polite and sweet mouthed... while serving food he was murmuring something and we felt that very disturbing...Again I am not saying about all the waiters there... A legendary restaurant like this , they should also look after these little things...
But I can't deny the taste and legacy of the place... it was a good experience there ...
#"Peter Cat" -Famous for a reason...

The curiosity of a child's mind was evident when I was asked why the joint was called "Peter Cat"... The query from my daughter got passed to the attendant ..who very nicely gave a long narrative to the kids..the main takeaway was its name was changed based on some Tokyo visit and post that it is a big success..
While authenticity of the tale I can't vouch for..I can surely vouch for the taste of " Chelo" kabab which they serve over years..the patience of those waiting outside will bear out the same...
Food is really good..as also the service..the ambience has remained standstill..the lamp shades,one of my friend said (over Facebook on my post)is the same as he has seen 15 years ago..his demand"chelo pack karke bhejo" shows like the lamp the memory of good taste lingers after decades!

My most favorite restaurant in Kolkata for Iranian/non-veg food. I love their sizzlers (grilled fish, dum ki raan, fish kebabs), chelo kebabs and desserts - that makes it basically everything. Chelo is Iran's national food.¬†

When I'm visiting alone I like to grab a glass of whiskey too!¬†

A must visit if you're new to Kolkata. But make sure you visit during odd hours, for you to find a comfortable table.

This is the sexiest place yet that I've visited in Kolkata. You will be baffled to see a queue outside waiting for their turns, this is highly highly likely. But the wait is worth every second you spend standing there. 
Ambience is splendid, you'll feel very comfy while having your food. The staff is very courteous, service very very up to the mark. Food, well it's out of this world. Their Chelo Kebabs are a trademark, so do have it. You can thank me later. 
Also, sizzler is equally well. 
We also ordered 1 portion of Pulao and a Chicken Bharta, tremendous taste, I can assure that the flavours will sing, once they are inside your mouth.
Love, and only Love for this place.

I don't actually remember how many a times i have been to this place...
But am afraid it is loosing it's charm by the time...The quality of Steak has degraded but still they make the best Chelo in town...
All time favourites-Original Chelo Kebab,House Special Sizzler,Cold Salad with Chicken and Chilli Chicken which is differently preapered here...
Request to the management to look after the issues as for us "Peter Cat" is a mean of happy fooding destination...

Good location just off Park Street's restaurant row. Good food (try their Chelo Kebab) and good waiters, but somewhat cramped with too many tables and very poor lighting. The seating could be a bit more roomy and the tables be made a bit bigger. if u order more, there is hardly any space on the table.
Though this place is most famous for their chello kababs (originally persian dish), but actually try their sizzlers too.Good selection of kebabs and other North Indian dishes. I used to go there since 2000 when my cousin brother used to supply chicken there.

The chelo kabab offered here alone deserves the rating I've given. If you're willing to experiment like I did with the sizzler, I suggest you don't as it wasn't nearly as good as other joints known for it.
Can get very crowded but if its food you love, then a busy restaurant shouldn't get in the way of that should it?
I stay abroad and have recommended peter cat to every acquaintance of mine visiting Kolkata and did not disappoint.

Peter Cat is known for its exquisiteness and it's worth it. Their signature dishes are mostly Chelo Kebab n Sizzlers. Apart from that, chef-recommended Grilled Becktty is also preferable. It is true this place needs prior booking sometimes and its exclusive food quality, ambience and food always pay off for it. I am very happy dining out there and want to go back again n again for Chelo Kabab n various sizzlers.

One of the landmark food joints of the city of joy Kolkata. It is located on the Park Street Flury's crossing. One would have to be really lucky to get a place without the usual waiting time of 30 min or else you can do with an early dinner or lunch. But it is well worth the wait.

The d√©cor of the restaurant has been the same for years and I guess we all love the hanging table top lights with an orange lamp shade.

Known for their continental cuisine and Indian cuisine, it is a must visit for a foodie.

Visited the place a week back with my sister in law and her son. We went for chello kabab, fried fish in tarter sauce, fried prawns, fish fingers and baked chicken. We loved every dish as their standard has remained the same for ages. I would not recommend their Biriyani but as for the rest you can try everything you will not be disappointed.

 I have been to this place a hundred times and will keep on coming back. All their kababs are lovely and succulent and their mocktail like bloody mary, zam zam, screwdriver etc is a must try.

One of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata famous for Mainly its mouthwatering Chelo Kebab. Situated at the heart of the town ,peter cat prepares the best Chelo kebab i ever tasted .Prepared and served very well It also has a good interior with red lamps hanging over the table.Taxes as per normal.The Chelo kebab is itslef so heavy that will not make you order for another dish.Even other north indian prepations of it is also equally tasty.
Disadvantage - Disgusting to wait in a long queue even on a weak day,
The waitors may seem little arrogant.
May be because of the continuous inflow of crowds

This place is a legend and needs no brownie points but after many visits I finally choose to pen down a review! Fabulous is the word. All their sizzlers are terrific. And other forms of cuisine and food ranging from Tandoori to baked dishes to European stuff are all as good as they come. The Chello Kebabs are a true testimony to the legend this place holds in the heart of the city of joy. Long queues outside every night and especially on weekends speak volumes about what Peter Cat is. Another prolific food item is their Dum ki Raan, a leg of mutton that is slow cooked with aromatic spices and served boneless with pickled salad. Do keep in mind that it is a restaurant first and then a bar so table etiquettes and quality of conversations do matter here. In short, order anything from their menu, and be all set to get delighted!

If you go to Park street and don't land up in Peter cat then it' s ¬†not your lucky day. ¬†Though 90% of the food lovers order chello kabab. I would recommend you to start with Sizzlers and at last order Chello Kabab. IT also has an amazing Biriyani taste.¬†

Peter Cat is one of Calcutta's oldest restaurants with an atmosphere that goes way back to the 1960s. Legend has it that the restaurant was named after a famous cat (named Peter) whose residence was the Lord's Cricket Ground in London from 1952 to 1964. Surely, a precious gift for a city that is completely crazy about cricket. The decor and the dimly-lit interiors speak of history. The waiters in their red and white Rajasthani outfits seem similar to the lighting inside the place. The menu that comes in the shape of a cat's head has some absolute delights. The legendary Chelo Kebab is a must have while you are visiting Peter Cat. The house special sizzler served with pork sausages, chicken steak, vegetables and eggs is another iconic dish of the restaurant. The dining room is intimate, with white walls, Tiffany-style lamps, and soft lighting.

One of the most favourite restaurants of mine..I love to visit this place just because of its famous chelo kebab...The taste of chelo kebab is just superb!! The butter rice will just melt in your mouth...I had also ordered for fish finger and two cocktails...Bloody Marry and The Chinese Itch...
Fish fingers were also good and is accompanied by white cream and French fries..Ummmm yummy indeed..
The Chinese itch...A perfect combination of vodka with pineapple juice..
BloodyMarry...Normal like other bars serve..
Another thing which I liked is the dress code of the staffs there..They were dressed as the Afgans..They were well behaved and knew about the dishes well..
The ambience is good with dim light all over...
The only thing they need to improve is the service...They take a lot of time to serve food..U will actually feel very hungry waiting at the table..
To end of..
You should definitely visit there at least once to taste Chello Kebab..Trust me its delicious üòã

I vistied this place on 23rd May 2016 around 2pm.  Ordered chelo kebab for all . Frankly speaking the taste was not at all upto the mark of traditional kebabs. Only that egg was good. 
Ambience was dinjy and clumsy with respect to 2nd floor. We ordered sizzlers which was horrible.
The staff was tiring to get rid off us and vacant the table for others . There was no extra plate given nor forks . I used the soiled fork . 
I called for the table manager . That person i think should be in customer service 
 He startef arguing with me on top his voice. 
Truly these restrurants only run because those customers who only eat food with a tagline but not for quality and taste .
Really disappointed and if you all people can understand what i am saying start boycotting .

Decorated beautifully with orange lamps along with staff dressed in pre-independence steward like attire PETER CAT has always been a wonderful place to dine at.
One of the few places in kolkata which has still maintained its heritage and give a feeling of old calcutta.
Apart from its signature dish Chelo kebab ,the retaurant do serve delicious persian,Iranian and indian dishes among them which I feel mention worthy are farah and fish makhmali both of which I did taste during my recent dining experience over there.
Above all the warm behaviour of the staff do add soothing spice to the dishes served.Nothing to say more...

When it comes to Peter Cat, the first thing which comes to our mind is the popular Iranian platter of Chello Kabab. I finally made it to this restaurant 4 days back to taste this particular plate of Chello Kabab. Ambiance wise, Peter Cat provides one of the best feel to have a drink and food simultaneously. My friend, who accompanied me had the Non Veg or the original Chelo Kabab and I being a Veggie, chose the Vegetarian version of the same. Initially, we ordered two pints of beer and by the time we finished our pint, the two steaming plates of Chello Kabab finally came to our table.¬†

From the first sight, it looked so mouth watering and consequently lived up to our expectations. The plate had about 8 pieces of sliced paneer kabab with rice and butter and sliced salad vegetables. The aroma and taste of Kabab was so smooth and enjoyable, that we did think of ordering another plate of the same, an idea we bunked after completing one plate.¬†
Overall, a must visit for all those foodies, who wants to try out the ever popular Kabab from Iran and at a place, which is considered as the most popular venue to have them.

Another one of the few nostalgic eating joints in Kolkata, that still manage to cling on to the pieces and fragments of a scintillating past. 
Back in the day, places like Mocambo and Peter Cat were the cool and 'hip' places to go to and were frequented by the ever-so-cosmopolitan Kolkata youth. Today the building is a little dilapidated, floors creak and there is the familiar musty smell of old wood. But the recipes that made this restaurant famous have been immaculately passed on to the next generation. 
Rhetoric aside, this is definitely one of places you need to visit if you want to truly experience Kolkata.
The ambience has a nice classical dim lighting. But if privacy is what you seek, don't expect to get much of it here. Due to high demand, they've tried to fit in as many tables and chairs together as possible so you end up practically rubbing shoulders with your neighbour. 
However what really put me off about this place was the attitude of most of the waiters. They ignored us on occasion, responded half heartedly and were overall pretty rude. They made distorted faces when I asked them to serve some water and took a good 15 minutes to do so. I understand that this is an old and famous establishment that is used to large crowds but if you don't start treating them better you're eventually going to lose them. 
Anyway that's where my complaints end.
We ordered 2 chelo kebabs with 2 bottles of beer. And boy was it a feast! Without a doubt one of the finest kebabs I have ever tasted and the entire set meal is an absolute feast. You really have to experience it to understand. Full marks for the food. The prices are slightly on the higher end though not all that much. 
All in all it was a decent experience bar the service. I really hope management looks into this.

Visited this place during the Durga Puja time and as obvious the crowd was huge!! We waited for almost an hour, because it was our first time and we were quite eager to taste the famous "Chelo Kabab" of Peter Cat!
This place has an amazing attraction and one simply can't avoid it; be it the ambiance or the cuisines of the restaurant, Peter Cat is completely different from the other diners.
"Chelo Kabab" was no doubt brilliant with the assorted savories but what I felt was that the quantity was a bit less than the usual pictures, which I have seen in Zomato! (maybe it was because of the overflowing crowd during the Puja time!)
The Chicken Biriyani was also delicious with the authentic North Indian flavor!

Overall a nice experience!

Legendary is the word to describe this place. Never has a day come when you can enter this place without being kept waiting. That explains the place in itself. Chilo kebabs are the superstars of the place and well they shall make you too bask in glory. Seriously. Ambiance is great and dusky to the right brink. Not very cool for a loud crowd, but a full go go for those on a lookout for class eating.

Old is Gold.One of the best restaurant in Park Street , rather in Kolkata. They are specialised in CHELLO KEBAB.They have a well stocked bar.Their sizzles are also one of the best in the town.Every penny is worth the food and it's also very reasonable.There are various fish kebabs which are also very good,out of which a dish named "FARAH" tastes superb.Overall a nice and cosy place to dine in with great food.Do prepare to be in queue if u plan to visit during peak dinner hours.

Peter Cat has always been and will still remain one of the best places in kolkata for getting a good meal. Their famous chelo kabab and sizzlers are just awesome... The ambiance is very pleasing and  classy. And while it is a bit expensive but doesn't matters as the food is very delicious. And most importantly Tlthis is a good place with good variety of Cocktails.

Peter Cat. The name needs no introduction any resident of Kolkata. An iconic address on the map of the city, and it surely doesn't disappoint. It being a Sunday, I knew there would be waiting, but I had not prepared to see the crowd outside the gates. At least 40 people were in the queue. But luck favoured and we were inside in just 10 mins. Happily seated, we ordered chicken steak (2 PCs) and chicken Irani kabab (8 PCs).  Though Chicken steak was unlike what I had had in Pune, since I had not expected the potato and honey taste, still It was good. I would recommend the sizzler one. Then came Chicken Irani kabab. It was perfect, though I missed the green chutney. Finally time for main course and because of various recommendations, we ordered Chello Kabab, and it was totally worth it. Mix of mutton and chicken, complete with rice, butter cubes and half fried egg poach. Heavenly it was. Then we were too heavy to order any other main course. Miscalculation of capacity apparently, hahaha. :)
Peter Cat is worth its name, worth every penny.

Kolkatta is my in laws place and this time finally we were able to visit this place. Long queue when we reached, after almost half an hour we were asked to sit inside. I am sorry for this rating but then there was nothing that I could appreciate. Ordered soup which was creamy(good) but it was cold, like really cold. next we ordered chelo kebabs i heard they were best in town, but i am sorry everything seems to be stale and cold like anything. I asked them to take this back and ordered sizzlers. This was the first time I say indian style sizzlers which tasted like paneer matar masala. :( Disappointed, extremely disappointed.

If you're a Calcuttan, you just can't miss this place. The best in the town to offer Chelo Kebabs..The ambience is awesome with dim lights, a very friendly and courteous staff, organised and most important, awesome food.Mostly one would see people waiting in the queue outside the restaurant. We reached around 3 pm and got a seat instantly, ordered the infamous the original chelo kebab and they never seem to miss out on that. Its a great place to chit chat and savour the delicious food. I enjoyed the lunch and the time spent.

We reached there around 6:30 a bit early for dinner and thus we didn't have to wait. Usually a very busy place. We saw people waiting by 7PM. Dimly lit place with lots of carpeting to muffle out the conversation sounds. Exceptional ambiance to have dinner in and talk. The seats were comfortable too. The staff was fast and amicable. We ordered drinks @165 each which came before the food and it was awesome. We ordered Chelo Kebab, Reshmi Butter Masala and Mixed Fried Rice and everything from the Rice to chicken to Kabab tasted great. The chicken of Chelo Kebab had a covering of capsicum which was really weird and I wish it didn't. Careful preparation was taking right upto the bathroom (with towels and doorman) to ensure a premium feeling at the place. Will definitely go back. Even though it looks and feels expensive there are restaurants around that are even more expensive right on Park Street.

And when you tell anyone in Kolkata that you went to Peter Cat the first question that comes to you : "Chelo Kabab kheyechis?" (Did you order the Chelo kabab?)..Yup Peter Cat is famous for the Chelo Kabab for all the right reasons. Situated at the prime location of Park Street, it is very easy to find the Cat out...Any weekend if you go you will find people standing in long queue to have a glimpse of the delicacies. I would recommend Chelo Kabab, Chicken Reshmi, Prawn Cocktail. If I visit Kolkata PC is always on my wishlist.¬†
Overall:¬†
Food - 8.5/10

Ambiance - 7.5/10

I visited this place on a weekday afternoon. I ordered reshmi butter chicken and 2 naans. The dish was delicious and the naan was super sized and worth is comparatively high price. The ambience and decor was great. This is one of the classic restaurants of Calcutta which never disappoints. 

The only con is that it can be quite an ordeal to find a parking space.

This place has been on my radar for quiet a long time now and the main reason was my dad. His overwhelming praise of this restaurant made me carve to dine here.
So last Thursday me and dad visited this resto.
The long hanging flowers shaped lamps and brick walls, servers wearing a traditional dresses, the sound of people chatting mixed with the crackle of sizzelers and the aroma of the delicious food being served gave the place an authentic vibe.
Staffs are very courteous and friendly and the service is quiet moderate.
Coming to food
Chicken Irani kebab - I wonder how could a chicken be so soft and flavourful. Perfect amount of spices and the tender soft chicken.
Betkey munerie - Again this was a boon to my taste buds. Soft, flavorful and my dad's favourite.
Nalli ghost - two big pieces of spicy, soft, flavourful mutto cooked in very delicious Indian spices. This was my favourite starter.
Chelo kebab - flavourful rice with soft chicken kebabs and a poached egg and butter. The mutton seek kebab was not upto the mark. It could have been way way better.
House special sizzler - I love sizzlers. The crackling sound and the aroma makes me more hungry. The chicken steaks were very soft and so were the liver and overall one of the best sizzlers I ever had.
Caramel custard - well I didn't like this dessert at all. It was nothing compared to a few I have had in Kolkata .
Overall a very good time spent here with delicious food and my dad. I now know why he praises this place so much.
P.s. - before I could take the pictures of chelo kebab and sizzler they were finished. My apologies
Cheer

This heritage place & a "monument" of kolkata foodies is synonymous with good food! one more thing they are synonymous with is their Chello Kebab which is every penny worth the gossip and nostalgia it evokes. Although its a minimalist preparation and a rhino like me needs to feed on 4 of them atleast to feel full still i am not at all disappointed. The rice of the dish is the best f***ing rice i have ever tasted in my entire life. The melting butter, the poached egg, the grilled veggies and the perfectly done sausages is a total knockout esp on winter evenings after a stroll on the Park Street. The dim setting (I belong it when restaurants have dim cozy lighting rather than full throttle stadium-grade flood lights), red lamps, cramped sitting is perfect for dates but equally good for a friends' day-out.
. 
MUST HAVES : Chello Kebab, House Special Sizzler, couple them with a pint of beer
PROS : Great food, Excellent ambience 
CONS : Quantity is poor (Quality is top notch though), the waiters lack through knowledge of the dishes and does not communicate properly, preparation time could be a bit faster, NOT COST EFFICIENT when you take the quantity under consideration!

A Kolkata legend, and rightly so! We had to wait in line for 20 mins to get into Peter Cat, but were delighted to finally eat there. We ordered the Chelo kebabs (one plate with both chicken and mutton kebabs) and the fish makhmali. Both were quite good, but the latter was definitely better. A must go!

Talking about the food, we ordered a House Special Chicken Sizzler with Sausage and Kidney, which tasted pretty decent and a mixed tandoori sizzler which was more like tandoori kebabs with a butter masala gravy. But the food was overall nice..
Ambience was very pleasing with dim lights and vintage decor. Although it remains very noisy with the neverending hustle of customers..
The service all though was very fast but the waiters were a bit ignorant and inattentive..

Overall it was a nice experience..

Every time I visit Kolkata, I have to visit Peter Cat! It's like tradition. Went for dinner last nite with school friends and I am happy to say that the food quality and the ambience is unchanged! Right from the Chanachur accompanying our drinksto the starters to their signature Chello Kabab, it's like some things in life will always remain great. On a Wednesday evening, the place was packed and we were lucky to get a table - goes to show the popularity of the place even after all these years. I think I have eaten here for the last 25 years and the food has always been good! The only put off was after being charged a 5%+ service charge, the old waiter still expects a hefty tip - and was grumpy when I did not oblige...üòÅ

Peter cat has been in my wishlist for a long time and finally the day arrived to taste the best chelo kabab in town. Had to wait outside for a couple of minutes as all the seats were taken. After entering we took seats upstairs. The ambience was nice, very classy. Even i liked their menu card,which is a cat's face in shape. Ordered fresh lime soda, a coke and The signature dish. It was mouth watering, the mutton kababs were so soft that just melted in my mouth. The rice was perfectly cooked. A perfect platter.A perfect lunch with perfect people. Thumbs up for the place.

Firstly, I would like to comment on the ambience. Its cool and dark, with lamps focusing on the food, and the decor lifts the spirit of the intended ambience. All these takes the stress out of you, the moment you enter, especially on a hot summer day.
And then as you would expect, I ordered the famous 'Chelo Kabab' (Mutton). I dont think i need to comment on this platter since it has already been done so many times. It encouraged me to try something else, and so i did: Tandoori Mixed Grill (sizzler), delicious and fun as you get all types of tandoors (fish, chicken, prawn, egg). Though an advice: after having a chelo kabab, you might need more than two people to finish a sizzler.
After having a belly full of meats, it felt stuffy inside, so i had a Jal Jeera. I felt comfortable drinking that (squeeze some lemon to enhance the taste).

Expecting nothing special we had been there for our dinner and it was totally disappointing as well...we ordered mixed grilled sizzler that contains chicken mutton prawns in it(i found more gravy than any pieces of those),was tasty n not so spicy....then mutton chelo kabab nd biriyani ala kashmiri which is nothing but chicken biriyani...i found nothing special in that chelo kabab dish..mutton was not boiled appropriately.. So to have the kabab smoothly was a tough task . And lastly that biriyani was a disaster....their biriyani simply tastes like rice with butter....as a whole had a bad experience....

Peter Cat is one of those Park Street institutions that continues to thrive commercially too.... Step in nd you are in another era with waiters wearing turbans nd pathan¬†suits that take you back to ‚ÄúMughalai‚Äù of the early 20th century.... Similar restaurants in Delhi‚Äôs Connaught Place may have lost their sheen,,, but Peter Cat, even if fraying,,, has the best chelo kebab served with white rice nd cubes of butter on the side,,,,, which just makes it irresistible.....

First of all the everyone should try the chelo kabab. It's a delicious item. The ambiance was perfect for dinner particularly with those dimming light. The serving management is an efficient one. The price of the items is quite high but it's worth it. After having your dinner you will not feel that you have wasted your money for nothing. I liked the idea of hanging lamps above each table. A thumbs up from my part.

Located just opposite to KFC & Au bon pain in Park Street.
The ambiance is classic with dimming lights.
Coming to food we ordered Chicken Chelo kababs-the signature dish of this place.
The moist & succulent kababs ¬†& the buttery scented rice made my day. I would like to point out that the seekh kababs should have been more tender.
Lastly we ordered one meringue with hot choclate sauce & vanilla ice-cream & it was absolutely delicious.
This place is definitely with your budget.
A must visit for every users.
Thankyou.

Do not order for Prawn Cocktail , it's hyped. Didn't order but they brought it because the food takes time to be cooked. Crap!! Nevertheless, didn't mind . So don't walk, run.

Now coming to the food first we order the chicken chelo kabab which consisted of one sunny side up egg, butter rice, 2 pieces chicken seekh kabab and 5 pieces of chicken kabab. The chicken kababs and the butter rice tasted too good but found the seekh kabab to be a bit dry. After that we ordered one meringue with vanilla icecream and hot chocolate sauce and it tasted divine . Its indeed one good restaurant :)

We were a group of 7 and went to celebrate my niece's good scores in her ICSE exams on ¬†7th May for lunch!! have been here umpteen times for 17-18 years and never felt so disappointed with the quality of the food!! Am a member of a popular foodies froup in Kolkata with 10000+ members and people have been posting there how peter cat isnt the same anymore, thats its quality has dwindled!!

We ordered ¬†cream of chicken soup, mutton chelo kebab, normal chelo kebab and the pi√®ce de r√©sistance "Tandoori mixed grill" thats passionately recommended ( printed on the menu !!!).. The Chelo kebab meals were okayish , nothing great with the meat being dry , devoid of any juices or aroma!! The soup was watery and not thick with bland cube shaped chicken pieces at the bottom!!

But my special remark has to be for the " Tandoori mixed grill" -- I mean what kind of a joke was this being served?? The service person said this will have pieces of lamb, chicken, fish, eggs and prawns spiced with indian tandoori masalas and served in a sizzler, sounded interesting and hence wanted to try it!! but what came was beyond our imagination or words... the meats were cooked in a ¬†MASALA GRAVY and put in a sizzler and served... so what we got was masala meat/fish curry.. it had 1 tiny mutton piece, i fish cube, 2 chicken pieces, i boiled egg and the TAIL OF A SHRIMP/PRAWN!!! The taste was pathetic and the whole dish looked so disturbing to the eye!! and this costs 375+taxes...WOW!!
My simple advice to this great joint is.. You have been brilliant over the years and have made a name for yourself all thanks to your food quality and your patrons who swear by your food... dont let them down and dont take them for granted... EVER!!

We ordered the bestseller famous CHELO KABAB , that is magnificent; amazing chicken kabab along with motton  kabab with some flavoured basmati rice ,fried egg grilled tomato and 3cubes of butter! And CHICKEN SIZZLER which is also great the smoky flavour with the crackle sound makes u hungry!!!! And the FISH MAKHMALI KABAB made with light spice ;lots of flavour and a moist coat outside which melts in your mouth #Must try . Each dish can be a meal it self

If u r lucky u don't have to wait but still the food worth the waiting!!!!!!

This was our second lunch in the city and the name of this place sounded pretty interesting, with a feature in the legendary restaurants collection, it was in the list of must visit. It is a dim lit place which is mostly full of corporate people coming out for lunch meets on a weekday. We ordered for Fish Makhmali Kebab, Chicken steak sizzler and Chelo Kabab The staff claimed that this place was where Chelo kebab's were invented (google tells its a Persian dish! :D ) The service was quick and the staff were very courteous with the guests. The place was noisy thanks to the people who prefer getting drunk in the afternoon!

Ambience is great, Service is excellent Food is v good , Place is also good. We ordered chelo kabab which is there speciality and it was just awesome in respect of both quality and quantity. It is a plate full of different types of kebab and butter rice,  it was just amazing ;) With that we ordered chicken butter masala and fish curry The chicken butter masala was quite good and was rich in spices, the fish preparation was also delicious and very tasty. The waiters over there are also quite cooperative, the restaurant is always full with people and the waiters are always running serving the customers. The prices of the dishes are also not that high, was within the budget. Therefore everthing is excellent about this restaurant. I didn't find any drawback:)

Typical Park Street Restaurant with its own charm.. Nice dim ambience, but seems it needs some renovation. The staffs seemed to be a bit arrogant, forget "service with smile". Coming to the food. It's signature dish Chelo kebab is really one of a kind. Also enjoyed nentara biryani, tastes a bit different than conventional veg biryani. Butter reshmi kebab masala was good.

Peter Cat doesn't require any introduction.It serves the best Chelo Kebab in the city.Tried the cocktail prawns and chicken asparagus soup,both were delicious.Ordered Tom Collins for drinks but it was too sweet.The d√©cor was very pretty especially the lights.Overall thumbs up.Highly recommended.

Well, Peter Cat stands out with its legendary aura.. This name gonna strike u first once u step into Park Street area.. A warm welcome into a dimly lit restaurant, carpet studded stairs rolling up to the upper floor, n tables to suit your mood.. Orders placed- fish makhmali, chicken Irani kebab, chelo kebab, mutton hamburger sizzler, grilled fish sizzler, and chicken sizzler. They tasted just awesome.! The only disappointment is poor service.. That is something which plays a prime role nowadays.. But if you are in a group, u surely gonna enjoy the dine-out..!

Whenever you walk or drive past Peter Cat, be it on a weekday or weekend, there is always a queue outside. Apparently, that explains EVERYTHING. This place is NEVER vacant. One of the best standalone outlets in Kolkata and popular, nonetheless. Have tried the very famous, Chelo kebabs, till date though. What I don't like , is you just have to move out, once you are done eating. Thanks to the crowd waiting outside for their turn. :)

It seems the old review gets automatically removed if you keep adding new pics for the restauarant!
Nonetheless, i don't mind writing reviews for my favorite restaurants! This one's one of them, and they serve the Kolkata special Chello kebabs...ficker lickingly yummilicious!
Have also tried their meat shikari, and the old fashion to down the meal with!

The food is good. The ambience sounds pleasing. A place where you can visit occassionally. The speciality lies in Chelo Kabab. Try the house sizzler as well... And the prawn cocktail. Deserts will be somewhat normal as compared to the foods. In short, a good place for foodies in kolkata...

Yesterday I visit Peter cat with my best friend to spent some good times with some good foods with a nostalgic feelings. We start off with apple juice and pineapple shake, then we ordered a Fish Farah Kebabs, it was really awesome and last we ordered the very famous¬† Chelo Kabab. All the things were good and tasty but i was¬† disappointed with the Chelo kababs, except the rice all the kababs were cold. I never expect this kind of service from PETER CAT.

Among many others, Park Street is famous for this restaurant and it's Chelo Kebab. Needless to say, they're legendary. Beautiful butter rice with chelo kebabs can make anyone happy .
I also like their Chicken Steak Sizzler. No complains regarding what so ever.

Peter cat is a place where a huge amount of nostalgia is attached to. Back then when I was a small kid we quite frequently used to have our gatherings in Peter cat. Way back we used to hog on chelo kebabs, Marrakesh & sizzlers. It's been almost 10 years since I left Kolkata and this winter when I got a chance to be at my hometown I visited Peter cat. I must say visiting Peter cat made me feel time has stopped there. The same old dimly lit restaurant with waiters wearing turbans and the same old chelo kebabs whose taste has been preserved and kept the same all these years. An awesome place, back in Bombay I am yet to come across a place which serves chelos anywhere close to Peter cat!!
Peter cat would always have a special mention in the list of restros I have visited my life!!! Thank you Peter cat for keeping the taste preserved and intact and taking me back in time with the taste!!

The olfactory of sizlers, one of the oldest diner in the city. A good place to be at when you're searching for a classy restaurant with good food and want to have a good experience. This place offers you a good variety and quality of food,good service and of course the time and money spent is worthwhile. Heard a lot about this place, and alas got a chance to be here. Impressive decor on my first visit here. Our order was chicken Irani kebab, strawberry crush, pineapple blossom and the all favorite chelo kebab. 
To strat of with, I was searching for something more spicy but when I asked them to suggest some, they replied saying they don't serve anything too spicy thus had to go with the chicken Irani kebab. I must say the kebab didn't disappointed me, the caramelized onions complimented the kebabs good. Though what I felt was, the kebab could have been a bit tender. The smoothies were really good, you get a good creamy feel when you'll have a first sip plus the essence of their respective flavours. 
Then came the legendary chelo kebab, I can dare to review that, but would like to mention that the rice was a bit undercooked. Otherwise the dish really lives upto to the hype it gathered in the past and still in continue. The poach, butter cube, kebabs and rice.. Yes they taste awesome, altogether. 
Was happy with the service. A bit costlier on the pocket but worth it for what they offer. The aroma inside the place whenever somebody orders for a sizlers is a plus. It increases your Appetite. 
In all would like to visit this place again.

Another old restaurant in Park Street with the promise of good food and though the menu is quite good and also the restaurant has a licence to serve alcohol with food, there is nothing better here than the chello kebab platter. Filling and sumptuous, with good presentation, it is worth every penny spent and the best part, when I dined there, almost every customer had ordered the chello kebab platter. Go to Peter Cat for this dish. Highly recommended.

After getting through the quintessential Peter Cat Queue which is present every damn day , one ought to get Good Food to make the wait worth it ! Must say, Peter Cat Never Ever ever Disappoints.
Chelo kabab is the speciality dish which hosts a sheekh kebab, poached egg and delicious chicken kebab along with rice, making it a complete dish and my all time favorite :)
Besides that, the sizzlers are really worth trying !
It's slightly heavy on the pocket.. But the charm and appeal of Peter Cat demands that compensation!
A must visit if you have not been here :)

On my recent visit to Kolkata, I knew this would be my last visit to Kolkata as no more traveling to this town. So I listed all my favorite Kolkata restaurant and made sure that I visit all of them before I leave town and head back to Delhi. I have been to Peter cat many times, can't count on fingers. So this time as well I had to wait like 20 odd minutes for the table, its a norm here. So no complaints. Ambiance : place takes you to classy times, where lights are dim, each table has the lamp over. Small tables which are getting old now. Comfortable and cozy place. 
Food :On my last visit, I ordered the same dish I had at my first visit in 2012 at Peter Cat. Mutton cheelo kabab: The signature dish at Peter cat. I have traveled all over India but nothing like this ever been served to me. I just love those moist mutton kababs, buttered rice. Perfect combination, colorful and balanced meal. You get your proteins, carbs, fats, Fibre all together in one dish. Loved it the first day I had it and this time as well. 
Service : the place is always full on evenings especially on the weekend so service does get affected. But still, they do a commendable job. 
So if you are here for the first time then do go with the signature dish. I had other items of menu aswell all are prepared really well and portion sizes are good too. 
So if I ever visit Kolkata again. I will be back for sure.

Peter Cat is my go to restaurant when I cant decide where to eat. This has been more of a family restaurant for me. Have been here innumerable times with my parents since my childhood. My favourites include chello kebab, tandoori mix grill sizzler, mutton biriyani ( though it tastes more like a pulao) , chicken steak sizzler, nalli nihari and in desserts their tutti fruiti ice cream is unique with cashews and nuts along with fruits. 
Only negative is that you have to wait for your turn to dine in whenever you go as the place is crowded throughout the week for lunch and dinner and they dont take reservations.

Location : Opposite KFC and right beside Au bon pain in Park Street this is a legendary restaurant in Kolkata.

Ambiance : typical of a restaurant at Park Street it exudes old world charm but somewhere u do feel it needs some renovation. The lighting is dim and i quite liked it.

Service : the staff have become a bit arrogant i guess and after repeated requests to change our table which was right at the entrance they did not listen. The waiter seemed in a hurry while taking the order. The food arrived pretty quick though.

Food : We ordered for the famous Chelo Kebab and the Veg mix grill sizzler. The food was really nice and tasty. I would however like to point out that the rice should have been warmer so that the butter cuber they put on it melt and the seekh kebab should have been more tender. The veg sizzler was surprisingly very well made. I specially like the palak thing they used.

Drink : we ordered for the strawberry milkshake. It was just about average. They should use more ice cream so that the shake is thicker.

Pocket pinch : our bill was for 1000 bucks which is okay given the standard of food and the quality of it. Definitely value for money.

All in all it was a good lunch and i returned really satisfied with the overall experience!

Peter cat, looks like Peter is having a ball missing this cat somewhere. Supposed to be a landmark dining, was wondering all the while I was there, what has made PC, the PC. Location tops the chart, ambiance number 2, rest is just average. Service, food for someone who has lived in the other metros is ordinary, waiting period of 45 min was so upsetting post all the overall experience. The most famous Cheloo kabeb keeps me wondering.

The popularity of this restaurant can be simply gauged by the fact that it is almost always full..weekend or weekday, day or night.
Overlook the slightly cramped and dingy interiors and go straight for its legendary speciality, the Chelo Kebab. Succulent reshmi and seekh kebabs on a bed of buttered rice topped with a fried egg - melt in your mouth and sinful.
I also enjoy their Chicken Steak Sizzler, not just the presentation but also the juicy meat and potatoes make for a wholesome meal. Definitely a must try restaurant in Kolkata.

I ordered chicken Irani kebabs and the original chelo. Well as per my experience it's just an average tasted kebabs with some butter rice and poached egg. The food tastes OK. Just fine for one time visit. The place is too gloomy and lifeless.

Anyway Ambience was okay and the staffs were well behaved.. Coming to Cleanliness.. The Glasses were not cleaned properly and was dirty s bit.. We ordered Pineapple Blossom in Juices.. Chelo Kebabs and Harem's Joy as their Harem Special Dish.. Quantity was more than Enough and the Quality was Very Good.. I would not say Excellent but it was very good.. We even ordered Grilled Fish Sizzler which was accompanied by a Glass of Lassi that I ordered also was perfectly okay and very good too.. Fame in its Name I would recommend everyone to visit this Outlet and Hope you enjoy your Food here as I enjoyed it overall too in a Weekday Dinner..

This is one of the restaurants in kolkata which stood the test of time and eventually became a legendary one. Although several famous places have come up recently still it is one the most sought after place in Kolkata. The ambiance is nice and cosy with a typical old kolkata charm. So you will find in the way the waiters are dressed. Famous for their continental food this place serves good indian food also. Everything is reasonably priced. Chelo kabab is the signature dish here but I find their sizzlers equally good. And does not matter when we go expect a waiting time of around 15 mins.

According to everyones suggestion, I went to Peter Cat to try their 'legendary' Chelo Kabab and Sizzler. But as they say, you have to wait several lives to get into heaven....we had to wait so long just to get into this restaurant, it felt like several lives.
When we got inside after nearly a 2.5 hours wait, I instantly felt claustrophobic. Tables were cramped in small places, one couple was already fighting with the waiter as their table was given just beside the table where waiters were keeping the dishes.
However we got our table and the waiter was very lethargic to take orders. When we called him to add 2 more drinks to our order, he acted like he was doing a favor. Then finally came the long waited food. Sizzler was pretty good, but chelo was just average. Tasted better chelo in other places in the city.

While coming out, I felt the interior is so dim lit that you can't actually see the floor where you are going. Overall, I felt it's an over hyped restaurant because of its heritage.

We got the table after waiting for a few minutes and upon entering, the decor and ambiance impressed us. But the same cannot be said about the food. We ordered its famous Chelo Kebab but it was not as extra ordinary as I hoped. It is no doubt good, but you get similar things elsewhere too. 

Overall, satisfied but not overly impressed.

Peter cat. The name doesn't require any introduction. This popular food joint has gained a cult status. The kolkattans have  nothing but praises to sing for this eatery. Synonymous with the exquisite ' chelo kebab', this park Street attraction has been satisfying the taste buds of people from all over the country since time immemorial. 
All the kebabs and the sizzlers are to die for. I also enjoy the hyderabadi biryani which is suggestive of the fact that their food is beyond reproach.

Icon on park street.¬†
Its very good food at very affordable prices. The ambiance is classic.¬†
The fabled chelo kebab does live up to its history and my personal favorite is the house special sizzler -the best sizzler in kolkata in my opinion.
There;s something amazing about the sauce that they drench most of their meat in - this brown, sweet and sticky thing makes this a very unique and almost perfect finding experience. I could drink that sauce.
Service is great, go on a weekday for lunch if you don't want to stand in line for over an hour.

Situated just adjacent to au bon pain, its the one authentic destination for their chello kebabs, although the dish is over-hyped i feel!! Chicken sizzler was an awesome dish which did justice to our palate...but what really made me crave for more was their fish kebab...'farah'!! Midblowing!! The ambience was dream-like there. Service was a bit slow which is because of the great crowd they handle each day. We had to wait in a queue fr around an hour. But other than that, all's great. Booze is on the cheaper side as well ;)

Peter cat is named as one of the legendary restaurants in kolkata... I was very eager to visit this place and finally today i visited there.. The restaurant is situated in the heart of park street area and is not hard to locate. The name itself says all about it.. I went there with my boyfriend.. The very first thing that will attract you is the awesome soothing decoration of the restaurant.. There is a shade of orange and grey all around.. We went there in the afternoon and we had to wait there for atleast 15 -20 mins.. We obviously ordered one chello kabab which is the signature dish of Peter Cat.. The chelo kabab is made of basmati rice with three small cubes of butter on the top of it, one egg poach nd ofcourse the mouth watering kababs. The kababs were very soft tender nd juicy and is available in the form of sheeks as well as round chunks. We also ordered for House special sizzlers where you will get two chicken steaks , sausages and liver cooked in a spicy sauce and it is also very delicious.. So i am rating this place 4.5 out of 5 because it maintains its quality. Though dishes are a little over priced but considering the taste and quality of food , i will say Worth it... Will love to visit here again..

I love this place for it's famous chelo kebab.the flavour of buttered rice with soft kebabs and poached egg is so yummy that no foodie can resist himself from visiting this place again and again.one more dish I love is chicken malai kebab in today's spl kebab menu.but one thing I would suggest that they should increase the quantity of food except chelo kebab.

The service is good though a lil slow but rest there is nothing you can complain about... Great place to visit..!!

Being one of the most prestigious restaurants in Kolkata ,me along with my family decided to pay a visit today on the auspicious occasion of Bengali New year. Besides ordering the prestigious Chelo Kebab, I decided to try the House's Special Sizzler and never in my wildest dream did I expect it to be that much lip-smacking. We also ordered a Virgin Mary along with some Kebabs which were garnished  with some Persian herbs. We were highly satisfied not only by the taste but also by the fast service. If you're a Sizzler lover, then Peter Cat's House's Special is a must.

I have always been a fan of Peter cat and its my joint for jaljeera and the mixed grill sizzler. But the last time I visited peter cat the chicken leg in the mixed grill sizzler came with excess gravy which I didn't enjoy and when I asked the management about it they said guests apparently ask for some gravy in their mixed grill sizzler.. Do we need to make every thing junta?

This being my most favourite food restaurant to spend some quality time with closed ones and family. Absolutely love the vibes from cordial welcomes to stepping inside the restaurant. The ambience inside is pretty cool as its provides you a private space to have a lunch or dine out with your family and loved ones. I have visited this place before and hatching a plan for my family get together to dine out there with hot sizzlers being served on each plate.

I happened to visit this place with a friend of mine for sunday lunch. It was already planned that we would have chelo kebabs and they were delecious and did strike every taste bud of mine. But the only downside to this place in my opinion is that the staffs are less cordial and you do need to wait allot attyms.

First, their signature dish ' Chelo Kabab' - what the hell happened? 1-2 years back it was all good, you could actually feel content by the quality as well as quantity as well as superiority of this dish. And now small portions of every items in this dish just makes me sad.
Well, I found a replacement to their signature dish - House Special Sizzler.
Start with tandoori Broccoli followed by Fish makhmali then to the house special sizzler for that 'Peter Cat experience' (have a beer along with).
I hope to return soon.
Happy munching..!

The city of Kolkata is popular gor many of its aspects. And Peter Cat is one such gem on the crown. Visited a lot and will visit again for sure as this place has left me delighted on my every visit. Infact, my silver jubilee anniversary was celebrated here only. One of the best in Kolkata.

Peter Cat is one of the most famous restaurants in the whole of Kolkata and it definitely lives up to it's hype. I have been here a couple of times and I was never disappointed. 
I have had the following :
Chelo Kebab - The most famous dish offer this restaurant. Absolutely delicious! Love fail to bits and pieces everything was perfect. The kebab was cooked to perfection. It was moist and succulent and even the rice, just by itself, tasted very nice
Grilled Beckty Muniere - Another absolutely fabulous dish. The Fish was cooked to perfection. It was soft and flaky, the sauce was also very very nice  and the vegetables also complimented the dish very well. Though if I do have to criticize anything then I must add that the potatoes were a tad undercooked, not a lot but a little bit.
Fish Sizzler - Another knock out dish. The fish was simply perfect. The rice was just amazing and as a whole it was just what a sizzler should be; hot, smokey and it had a wonderful aroma which filled the whole table. This is definitely one of the best sizzlers I have had in quite a long time and certainly among the best 5 I have tried in Kolkata. 
Apart from this since my parents love Indian food so we have tried the  tandoori chicken, dal makhni, roti and palak paneer. 
The tandoori chicken was very very well cooked, the chicken was moist and succulent and it had a very nice flavour but I must add that the flavour was only on the outside for me the chicken inside was quite bland. 
The palak paneer was quite loved by everyone, apparently it was the best palak paneer my family had ever had. I did not try it since I'm not quite fond of Indian food so I can't really say but I heard some rave reviews about the dish, so I would suggest it if you are an Indian food lover.
The dal makhni though was quite a disappointment. It was quite sweet and that made it quiet unpleasant. I have no idea what they put in it, but it definitely had a sweetish flavour which was not liked by anyone in my family, so if I had to choose any dish that I would like to replace out of whatever I've had so far, the dal makhni would be it.
To sum it up, Peter cat is definitely a place worth trying. The best part about it is that the food is not very costly, you have a wonderful Ambience, some wonderful staff and definitely a fine dining experience, but the price is definitely not over the top or overly extravagant. This is definitely well within the budget and you are bound to have a wonderful experience. Trust me!

Visited today.. Ordered Chelo Kabab and Grilled fish apart from desserts... I won't say much about the food quality as others have said a lot... But the egg in the Chelo Kabab came with some tiny pieces of egg shell for free... The pieces were so small that they could hardly be seen but were very much discernible in the mouth... When I complained, they just did nothing. The very least I expected was to have the egg portion of the dish replaced, but they did nothing. They demanded "proof" of those... Unfortunately, I didn't carry a microscope, so couldn't produce the proof... So here I am, narrating my experience to folks over here.. So the next time you take your Chelo Kabab, watch out for those egg shells...

And by the way, the original Chelo Kabab had two pieces of mutton... I can't see the logic of serving mutton in the normal Chelo Kabab when there's a separate dish with mutton included... It could be a deal breaker for those who don't touch mutton like myself...

To sum up, five stars for food, one star for service, three stars for price...

We ordered non veg chillo kabab which was heaven on earth for my friends the rice served along was brilliant..... Again we ordered veg Sizzler which was damn hot n tasty.... It contained stuffed tomato paneer Tikka and other vegetables and had a perfect taste.... In beverage we ordered margerata which was too strong as a cocktail but was ok..... And then came chill baby corn.... Mind u they don't serve crispy.... So the name of baby corn is Chilli baby corn which was gud but I like crispy more.....

This restaurant is probably one of the most popular and well-known in the city. A favourite haunt for even celebrities, their chelo kebab and sizzlers need no introduction. I've tasted their chelo, mutton and chicken steak sizzler and all were simply amazing dishes. Right from the tantalising smell wafting and hovering on the air to the sizzling noice of the sizzler till you thrust a crunchy morsel in your mouth, the entire experience is one worth having and indulging in. Have visited here on the occasion of my birthdays and for family lunches during the Pujas, and every time the Cat has meowed at me with beckoning dishes !

Well well well!!! so much of hype about peter cat peter cat when i came to kolkata.. i was like lets give a try. happen to visit this place recently only to wait for half an hour and to find a table when i entered this place was stinking and the decor is so old. well we got cake for my friends bday, when we went to the table the instruction given to me by ¬†the staff was " outside foods not allowed even to consume here and you dare to cut it here" wow what a threatening man , i had been to so many places nvr found something of this sort, secondly we were three so we asked for a table with less sitting capacity as the table had 6, one staff directed us to a table which was in upstairs when we went another staff yelled at the other and us stating who had asked u to come here this place is not supposed for dining(Hw on earth do we know) and they had a verbal spat¬† and we were redirected to a table of 6 again. anyhow we ordered for sizzlers food was ok and we ordered jaljeera which was sooo damn terrible probably for next 10 yr i will nvr order. the staff came to serve literally throw the plate on us and banged the table i was forced to call another staff and complain about the behavior of the issue and the taste of jaljeera,, well looked like went to deaf ears no apology nothing no change in the drink. Avoid as much as you can.. my rating for dis place is 1 because of its service.. and i will never recommend this place to anybody ever.

I happened to visit this place on one my food-centric trips in kolkata and since park Street is the food-capital area in Kolkata ,this is one of the indispensable recommendations by all food enthusiasts!
We made it a point to take plunge and stick to the recommendations- the Chello kebabs!
Tender succulent meat was served in form of sheekh as well as chunks -they impressed every tastebud to the core, and the happiness of a sumptuous meal sunk down to the heart.
We dropped by around 6pm but had to enroll ourselves in the waiting register, so now you can imagine the crowd during the suppertime!
The seating is cosy with an otherwise dark hall and small bulbs placed right over each table,ideal for some deserved privacy for the guests.
The staff was warm,well versed with the menu and quick to make confident recommendations,much appreciated.
One the price side,it seems reasonable for the league of restaurants Petercat makes it's presence felt in!

TIP- Try avoiding the rush hours and hence the long queues and waiting periods.

Visiting this place since childhood. Never manage to get a seat without waiting. But as they say to get something good you need to wait...from ambience to the quality of food, have nothing to complain against. Everytime I visited this place, I had nothing but contentment. This place offers the best Chelo Kabab in the city, according to me. The Prawn Cocktail is a delight!!! The sizzlers are good enough. The Fish Muniere won't disappoint anyone. This place should be a must visit for a person who is in love with food at Kolkata....

I was quite eager to try this place as it was much acclaimed and recommended by many people. The hardest part was getting into the restaurant , as it was saturday night and I had to wait almost an hour before getting a table.
The resturant had the old times family restaurant vibe to it and that's why it takes us back to the memory lane of our childhood going in these types of places with our family.
Within no time, we ordered mutton chelo kebeb which was enthusiatically recommended by the server and fish makhmali before the kebab. 
The kebab dish was absolutely delicious. It had mutton seekh, grilled chicken , half fried egg over rice over it.
The seekh was perfectly done and the chicken tasted fabulous and the egg complimented the rice. The fish made out of betki was smooth in texture and soft but not too soft. There was a namkeen served with the drinks , it was also good.
This place is must visit when you are in kolkata.

This one is a legendary eatery of Kolkata. Though the place is known for chelo kebabs, I love the sizzlers there, especially the roast chicken sizzler. The service staff is dressed in white with red turbans, quite efficient in their job but do not expect them to smile at you like the newer outlets of the city. But the food is superb :) If you on a weeekend,¬†you might have to wait for some time but the food is worth the wait.¬†
If you dont check out this place when in Kolkata, you definitely miss out on a big chunk of old world Kolkata :)

If you plan on visiting this place during a summer afternoon, please do not, you'll have to stand in a queue in the sweltering heat and all your enthusiasm to try out the delicacies inside will drain out. The restaurant is filled with tables all around, each under a lamp which makes one feel comfortable. The food is not too great to proudly say "I had food in Peter cat", yes, it is tasty and it tastes exactly what it does in other restaurants, there's nothing special. The chelo kebab is good and the platter is quite impressive.

I know I'm committing sacrilege and frankly I don't care. I'd rather be the child who calls the emperor naked than the crowd which has drowned in the praise for something that is not worthy. Possibly (unfortunately) the most popular joint on Calcutta's "legendary" Park Street named Peter Cat.

Price is a bit higher...bt its not d best place to booze beacuse the price is on the higher side n they arent famous for cocktails.
Enjoy the food n for the first timers chello kebab is must.Go for the sizzling sizzlers too.

Waiters will hardly listen to you... One important thing is that quantity is very less in the items although the food is very good (non veg items) especially the kebabs. Will suggest to visit on odd hours so that you could enjoy your food peacefully

This place is actually known for its sizzlers and chello kabab... well everytime i go there.. i end up having the chello kabab again and again... although i have had chello from different other restaurants.. but this is definitely the best from the rest...the buttery scented rice, juicy succulent kababs all makes me come back here again and again.. really looking foward to come here yet again.

A must visit place for all big foodies in kolkata.  Their special item is Chelo kebab.  One of my most favourite item. 
 Their sizzlers are also very good.  Chicken marakash  named dish is also quite good.  It's a chelo kebab alike dish.  
For cocktails,  gentle murderer is the best there in my opinion.

Drawing insane amounts of crowd each day, queue meandering so much that to the uninitiated it may reminisce of Apple fanboys lines right before launch date. Yes! Exactly that one line of over obsessed individuals. The topic of conversation this post - their most popular offering - Chelo Kebab.

The dish
So, there is steamed basmati rice with a dollop of melting Amul butter trying to be seductive but clearly it does not happening. Flanked by two lukewarm seekhs of mutton kebab, they are anorexic and kinda look sad. Kebabs being thin is like Thums Up served at room temperature - an absolute insult!¬†

Then there is roasted chicken tikka with capsicum and onions, which is nothing to write home about, and then the oh by the way sunny side up; which doesn't look too happy or as a matter of fact sunny.

RM: Speaking of sunny this place could do with some more light like literally. I refuse to click this photos and let this be known officially that I did not eat anything here. This dish is like that spider you crush with a book. You know its a mess underneath but you still can't resist looking. This chelo kabab is a mess but still - magically - everyone want to eat it.

With great fervour, even after the very minimal aesthetic pleasure derived from the sight of the dish, we reluctantly dig in, trying to find something magical in the rice, some flavour that will belie it's peasant appearance and thudd ... it's just steamed rice, with butter; back to gravity.¬†

The kebab is at best average, and very below average for a place of this "reputation". Next in line is another common kebab, reshmi, which is not reshmi, it looks reshmi, white and creamy and all that, but the chicken is hard and again - magically - it's lukewarm! By the end of these three I didn't even want to travel far upto the egg, I wanted it to remain a breakfast fav, I didn't want to insult it just because these guys put it on a plate with the others.

PC: Any true Calcuttan worth the rosogullas he has eaten will be able to point you to the road opposite (Free School Street) and help you identify a small restaurant that will give you some serious kebabs. What it may lack in pomp it will make up in taste.

There is no great service here either. Age old ambience though, colonial almost, felt good while we walked in, it kind of helps build up the legend. Managers are really not too courteous after a long wait outside. All they have on their agenda is to flip tables as fast as possible. Don't be surprised if you are handed the menu right outside while you wait. Some of the old timers are pretty much a part of the decor here. The dust settled on the low hanging lamps. Rahul insists that we point out and mention that dust found in human living space mostly consists of dead human skin. Yeah. Let that sink in a bit.

The weather was Calcutta winters: I love you. Glorious food: I love you too. But Peter Cat, do better, for the those still in the queue :)

Chelo Kebab at Peter Cat has attained a strange coveted status that really does not live up to the expectations by any stretch of imagination. It is at best an imitation of a real chelo kebab that has gone awfully wrong.

For our list of the best things to eat in Calcutta, this experience got Peter, Cut!

This place needs no introduction as it's the pioneer of chelo kebabs in Kolkata. Located in Park Street it enjoys the luxury of the location that attracts foodies from every nook and corner of the city. Have been to this place umpteen times & goes without saying all credit goes to chelo kebabs. Veg or non-veg chelo kebabs is never going to disappoint you. What's compliments it is the ambience, with ample seating arrangement though it's never enough for the chelo kebabs keep lining up, and also the service is also upto the mark. The only thing that bothers is, I always have to wait to grab a seat here. Otherwise all is good at Peter cat.
P. S - Do go for chelo kebabs!

The queue outside the restaurant at all times will sure tell you how popular this place is. If you're vegetarian, this isn't really a place for you. However do try the Chello Kebab, atleast once to test if the hype is real. It definitely is a one time visit, if not more.

Ordered Lahsooni Nan and Butterr Naan, its size was horribly thick, hard to break, hard to eat, hard to chew and hard to digest!! Paneer Makhan Masala had no masala, only Makhan and Paneer and infact full of makhan. Chilly babycorn had 50% chilly, 25% babycorn and 25% capsicum. Next to impossible to eat their chilly babycorn, so we also didn't finished even 25% of that. Non-Veg is famous there but chilu kebab n 1 other main course was also very yucky taste. Only good thing abt this place is its location.... Thats it!
But when I came out I saw huge waiting was going on. Don't what exactly good is there. Whatever it is my experience was very bad.
Will never go here since dnt wnt to ruin up my meal.

Took my family to this place.¬† We ordered chello kebabs and some continental stuff. The quality of food was good. Deduct 0.5 as the steward created confusion with seating arrangement after a long wait time.

The ambience is good but everything else is over hyped. Had to wait 45 mins just to get in. The food came in another 30 mins after we placed the order. 

Coming to the food, it was average. We had ordered the "famous" chelo kebab meal. We didn't find anything spectacular. The kebabs tasted like any road side eatery or worse. The seek kebabs were dry and there was too much butter in every thing. 
There was hardly any items for my vegetarian friends. The paneer masala was tasteless as it didn't have proper seasoning.

If you want to spend time in a good rustic ambience you will like this restaurant. However, if you want good food please avoid this place. There are better places in Kolkata.

The iconic place which is on eveyone's bucket list.

Highlights : Chelo Kebabs, Sizzlers.

Chelo Kebab has been associated with this restaurant for years and my favourite too. Buttered rice served will assorted kebabs and a poached egg. The presentation hasn't changed ever and its a killer. Sizzlers are nice.

Warning : Book in advance for weekends.

Went to this place today for lunch. This was my first visit to peter cat. Had heard a lot about this restaurant, especially the chelo kebab. So, the first thing that I ordered was chelo kebab. Also ordered fish makhmali. Management is quite efficient, polite and attentive staff. Service was fast. Nice ambience and interiors. 
Now, coming to the food, the chelo kebab was really good, the kebab sticks were full of flavours, the grilled veggies and chicken were also well marinated. The fish was also a tandoori dish, it was also awesome, soft as butter. This place is definitely my new favourite... üòã

Had taken my family to Peter Cat with lot of expectations. Ambience was dim and that won't let you realise how packed the restaurant is! Staff and waiters are polite clad in dress that would remind you of pre independent era Punjab.
But the food really fell short of the expectations. We even tried their famois chello kebab but found that the kebab was burnt! Chicken Irani kebab and shikhar mutton kebab were also very ordinary.
Overall not a good experience for me.

*They won't let you cut birthday cakes inside.
*Someone may ask you for a TIP pretty boldly. :P

Have to wait for sometime after ordering the famous chelo kebab, but its worth the wait. Very delicious & really well prepared, felt quantity of rice should be a bit more... our food journey ended with my fav vanilla ice cream :)

I was visiting this city after a long time in January and had no idea which restaurant to go for lunch. So a bunch of us decided and chose this place based on zomato reviews.¬†

Well we entered here in very odd lunch hours , to be precise around 3:30 pm . To know that they still serve lunch was a matter of joy as we were really hungry. We ordered for a soup, drinks , mushroom and fish makhmali kabab starters. The food came after 40 mins of wait but thankfully tasted good. Then we took their recommendation for main course and asked them to serve quickly. We had the famous chelo kabab ( veg and non-veg) and a chicken sizzler. Again the food came after 30 - 40 mins. None of us liked the sizzler. Chelo kabab were good but had too much of butter in it which I don't like personally as the flavour and taste of butter was over powering everything else in the dish.¬†
I personally expected a better service and food quality from this place.

A legendary restaurant in the heart of Park Street, Peter Cat needs no introduction. A Friday night dinner over there definitely marks the beginning of a great weekend. So there I was to start my weekend with a bang! I had been there before during pujas and honestly speaking I was thoroughly disappointed and was determined not to go there again (Many would frown, I know). But this time around I was simply blown away by the sumptuous dishes. I had chicken chelo kabab ( must ), chicken marrakesh ( a variant of chelo kabab, instead of the egg you are served with a capsicum with chicken stuffing. Psst I liked it better than its original variant!) and dum ki rann. Dum ki rann is a mutton dish served as a starter and it was delicious. I am really glad I went back. Else, my the foodie in me would have been deprived of the brilliant chicken Marrakesh!

This is one of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata & one should expect a huge line for a table. Never did I stand for less than 1 hour. However once you enter, the feeling changes. it takes long for the food to come but I am patient to wait long to have some delicacies.
Chelo Kebab is their specialty. First-time goers, its a must try. Also try their sizzlers. They are equally delicious. Thats what I had the last time I visited. Yummy!!!
Lastly, please don't whine about the price. We all know its high. "Mehengai ka zamana haye." But try a new taste.

Its been a great experience out there. You should definitely go ahead. Its always a big yes for Peter Cat. Chello kebab is the best out here. But you must try the Bhetki meuniere. Its awesome. Among the veg, paneer tikka was really good. The ambience is too good. Continental dishes are their speciality. A must visit.

A long pending wish fulfilled. Never got a chance to eat there due to the lines outside. Finally, last month was successful. Tried chelo kebab, goat biryani etc. Food was good, didn't like the dessert much though. Desserts were pretty ordinary. But you have to love the ambience. I would not recommend for a family get together as we were 8 people and they gave us a square table at the end corner which was very congested.

Hi everybody, since last three years I religiously pay my annual visit to my favourite 'Chelo Kebab' there. I have had Chelo kebabs some other restaurants too but "PC" just owns it like Peter Cat is the synonym of "Chelo Kebab" but now over the time I'm little disappointed with the kind of service they offer, waiting for food is not a taxing thing if you have a great company but it becomes a taxation when you and your COMPANIES are just HUNGRY! well I can't complaint about ambiance as I find solace in those dimly lit vermilion light and amber lamps!!! last but not the least if you could just add a li'l detailing in your Cockltail Menu viz. name of the rum/gin/whiskey/vodka you're using, that would help a lot and save time of your servicemen. :)

Tried Chello Kababs - much over rated. The Seekh kababs in it were bland and insipid. The boti kababs however were good - melt in the mouth.
Overall i felt this dish was a disappointment.

Would like to try something else next time. Hopefully it'll be better.

Nice ambience and good service did not disappoint.

This amazing, classy and beautiful place holds the legacy of serving the best chelos in the city. Ask anyone about #PeterCat and they will come up saying #Chelokababs. That is the one dish you should try if you happen to visit the place. Apart from the mouth watering chelos, we ordered #chickenbharta with #tandoorirotis and #RoastedChickenSizzler. No doubt that the place is always full and to add on that, it was a holi evening. #Chickenbharta tasted really well but the sizzler would have been better. Oh yes! Don't try the #prawncocktail, very less in amount and doesn't even taste well. The ambience is exceptionally good. What adds the cherry on the cake is the location of the restaurant. I really liked the menu cards in shape of cats,  Service was pretty slow though!!
But #Chelos are something that make #petercat stands out from the crowd.... 

P.S:-  Peter Cat is pretty reasonable and is not as pricey as it seems

After being a patron of Peter cat for more than a couple of decades - I have been utterly disappointed with my experience today. 
The service and the quality of food which Peter cat stands for is no longer sadly there.
The soft drinks took 15 mins and the roasted papad took 25 mins.
After waiting for 40 mins and constant reminders the food finally came and the sizzler was inedible and the chicken butter masala is yet to be tasted !!!
Mr. Hansey was helpful who offered to replace the sizzler. Whereas Mr. Lawrence had too many tables to handle it felt. 
THIS IS A LIVE REVIEW!

Went to Peter Cat for the first time few days ago. The food was good but not excellent (I think it is extremely over hyped). But the real disappointment was their service. Ohhh.....first of all you have to sit on to the place of waiter's choice though the whole shop is empty. We had ordered to Chelo kabab & a Sizzler. As we started with sizzler by the time we finished the sizzler the Kabab gets cold so I asked the waiter just to warm it. Oh my god!! the reaction the waiter gives......with loud voice he said they don't even have an oven to warm food!!!! Real disappointment.

Me and my friends was there for a dinner
We ordered tandoori chicken Reshmi Kabab few drinks and chelo Kabab of course the chelo Kababs was the showstopper
I am very satisfied with the food quality, Ambience and the behaviour of waiters.
the only grievance what I have is -the glasses they use for serving drinks should be more better on and sophisticated. :(

Well Peter cat is a legendary restaurant that's what I know. I have never gone there but ordered online twice uptil now.
‚Ä¢Conduct- the guy who spoke to me over phone was very polite and brief.
‚Ä¢Food ordered- Chelo kebab and the other day mutton rogan josh.
‚Ä¢Chelo kebab:
‚Ä¢Time- delivered timely.
‚Ä¢Hot or cold- warm
‚Ä¢Packaging- Poor, old fashioned, not at all spill proof, u can see the picture..
‚Ä¢Quality- Good but not anything special.
‚Ä¢Quantity- Sufficient for an adult with normal apetite.
‚Ä¢Price- Overpriced 
.
.
‚Ä¢Rogan josh:
‚Ä¢Time- delivered timely
‚Ä¢Hot/Cold- almost cold.
‚Ä¢Packaging- same old same old!
‚Ä¢Quality- Disgusting, the meat was not properly cooked, and there was a typical smell. I cudnt eat with that smell. I planned to add some spices to the gravy in the evening so I refrigerate it and in the evening I found the meat was not good. It was definitely not a fresh meat. Yuk!
‚Ä¢Quantity- sufficient for a kid or a person with low aperite.
‚Ä¢Price- With that inferior quality, poor packaging and that quantity, the price feels like loot. Lol!
But the zomato people are awesome.

Had only Chelo Kababs, they were brilliant. The preparation is like Iranian Kababs and similarly are served on rice bed. 
Didn't try any other food as its filling enough for a heavy lunch. Go for it

I have been going to this place forever, but I suspect that is true for most Calcuttans. Their chelo kebab is of course legendary. But for those not so fond of eggs like myself, the Marakesh is also a very good option. It is similar to the chelo, with a stuffed tomato instead of a fried egg. The rest of the kebabs are the same. Peter Cat serves mind blowing sizzlers. I especially love the House special which has chicken breast, sausages, liver and potato cooked in delicious barbecue sauce. The tandoori mixed grill is a perfect choice for those who like spicy food. It has chicken, mutton as well as prawn cooked in a heavy gravy.I believe the desserts at this place are the least talked about in spite of being absolutely heavenly. They make the chocolate sauce themselves, it does not come out of a bottle. Hence it is thick, creamy and chocolaty and is always served in a separate milk jug. The meringue with ice cream and chocolate sauce is one of my favorites. The brownie with ice cream and the same chocolate sauce is also great. Try the souffle of the day. We had a mocha flavored souffle once and it was absolutely amazing. For those not too fond of chocolate, they also serve a super tooty fruity ice cream.

We ordered obviously The Chelo Kabab first...tempting..hot..steamed basmati rice..with 3cubes of butter..an egg poach on top..along with a chkn kabab and two mutton kabab... Just loved it. My plate was finished too soon.. Then we ordered Dum ki Run.in sizzler course.. With bread rolls.. Again a great dish..the taste was so good..so mesmerizing.. Yes,the foods are little expensive though.. But for the love of food... I wl visit again there.

I think this is my third consecutive 4 rating for a joint, am i going soft...probably not....this place is in the prime business area of park street, so no wonder its gotta be costly, but it ain't surprisingly.... For the food part, the Chelo kebab (pic uploaded along with) is really good, if you taste individually, the sub parts of the cuisine, it doesn't hit you particularly, but, when you see it in unison, it is something to go back to again & again & again.... the ambience is bit crowded, but then this is Sunday so 'but natural', maybe a visit or two more during weekdays will give a proper idea. Overall, the area rocks so do the joints in the area including this one.....

This restaurant was in my wish list for a long time but I never got the chance to visit. But this time when I visited Kolkata I went to this place. The d√©cor was very pretty with dim lights. We ordered pineapple juice, orange juice, fish makhmali, chello kebab and chicken steak. The orange juice was canned juice and not freshly made so it was nothing exceptional but the pineapple juice was freshly made and tasted great. Fish makhmali was very good. It was made with good quality fish and melted in mouth. Chello kebab and steak both were very good and justified the reputation they had.

There was a 15 min waiting for a table on a Sunday at 1pm. We were lucky to have found a table quickly as people who had reached 10min after us were still waiting to get in when we were on our way out, an hour later.

The wait is justified though. We were able to try only the Chelo kebabs and the Fish makhmali kebab. Both were awesome with a unique "burnt flavor" and melt in your mouth morsels. The chicken chelo kebab was definitely better than the mutton chelo.

Chalo Kabab is synonym for Peter Cat in Kolkata. Have tried the same dish on many places but it can't be at per like Peter Cat. Be it the chicken chelo Kabab or the mutton counterpart. It's a must must must try for foodies in Kolkata

Food Great. Service pathetic.
The quality and taste remains the same however the servers believe they are the owners and think guests are eating for free.
I ordered a bread, was told will take 20 mins, however another another variety will be ready in 5 mins. However after 25 mins, still not ready. When I asked status, was told we are looking into it. ¬†The server was so proud as if he owns the place and was doing a favor by serving us.
I was hungry and had my pregnant wife with me who at this stage cannot wait long. When I told them to cancel and call their manager they least bothered. We left the place hungry.
After another 10 mins manager came who had a apology script ready. Infact I by mistake ended up paying them 500 Bucks extra which they least bothered to return. It was my mistake.
Recommended for taste .. Simply No Go for service.¬†
Peter Cat Management should take note. Rating is just basis taste.

Peter Cat, is one such place which needs no review. The name it's self is a brand on its own.¬†
And there's so much more to this place, standing tall in Park Street, other than Chello Kebab.
I loved the chicken steak sizzler, Coming with all the sizzle two big pieces of chicken steak, pounded well and well coated with a gravy which tastes way beyond words, accompanied with veggies, which too have a great crunch on it and basted with garlic butter, and on top a perfect sunny side up. The moment you break open the egg, the silky smooth yolk flows and makes the the sizzler a perfect one.
I couldn't eat the entire sizzler, though  my tastebuds wanted me to. It's a huge quantity.¬†

Peter Cat, sticks to it quality, satisfying it's customers

This is one of the legendary restaurant that Kolkata raves about. Being a kolkatan,  its my discredit that this was the first time I visited Peter Cat. 

You talk about Peter Cat and Chelo Kabab is the only thing that will come to your mind. 
So me along with my hubby opted for fish makhmali and Chelo Kabab.  To gulp this down,  we ordered for two cocktails - bachelor's and screw driver. 

Fish makhmali absolutely justifies it's name. Utterly soft and truly delicious I must say.  
But for Chelo Kabab,  I got a bit disappointed as the mutton Kabab seemed to be very chewy and not much delicious.  The chicken Kabab was very dry and thus I couldn't enjoyed my meal. 

It seemed to me that it would have been better if we tried the other dishes rather than the legendary dish. 

Nevertheless,  I would love to visit this awesome restaurant again for its perfect ambience.

So how do I rate this one? The bongs swear by Peter Cat and there is a waiting period outside the restaurant. You move and and you realize that you came in a place that has stood still in time. The red rexin sofa covers, the ancient cutlery. The glasses are the ones which are thick glass, the types that you see in a Dhaba. So avg on ambiance. The food is good and the staff is friendly. The Chelo Kabab is the most overrated dish on the planet. A disastrous mixture of Shieek Kabab, chicken kabab and some rice. Completely to be skipped. You could go in this place for some good food without high expectations.

Had heard a lot about 'chello kabab' here, and people waiting outside to get a table. I went there on a weekday afternoon and was made to wait 10 mins before being allowed inside, only to find half the restaurant empty. 

Anyway ordered the 'chello kabab' which turned out to be nothing more than a non veg platter. 2 sticks of mutton seekh, 2 sticks of chicken tikka, buttered rice and a half fried egg. The taste was good but kababs were dry, which happens when you lower the already made kabab back into the tandoor to re heat, or keep the marinated meat too long in freezer. It kind of gets dehydrated and doesn't stay succulent.

Overall not bad. The portion is decent and considering the location, ambience, and fame the price tag of around ‚Çπ 400/- per plate is fair.

This Restuarant brings back childhood memories thus everyone of us has a bias for this place , The chelo kabab and sizzlers are foods people long for , waiting in queue for hours to get a table. One such afternoon probably a month back i waited for an hour for a table and was delighted at that thought of good food. I ordered Chicken sizzler and a chelo kabab . The Chelo kabab was good but the sizzler was highly disappointing , it was as if its called a sizzler just for the sake of it , and it was just an indian dish served on a hot sizzler plate with no taste to its credit .
But what struck me most was the staff behaviour , although they were not rude but there arrogance is written all over there attitude , maybe because they see people waiting and yearning for entry to there restuarant , whatever the reason its annoying .

One of the places that that eluded me for this long is Peter cat. I wanted to go for this a long time and finally visited in my birthday this year. We were luck enough not having to wait even a minute. We were given a seat upstairs and one thing that was noticeable were the waiters were somehow shabbily dressed,and their dress being white did not help their cause.
Now coming to the most important part,food. We had chello and it was just amazing. The butter tasted heavenly and the mutton kebabs were exceptionally tasty. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and overall the meal was lip smacking. 
Do visit this place of you havent already and do try out the chello kebab. Though I have heard that their quality and taste is not like it used to be,if you are a first time it would matter. That would be the best thing you'd have had in quite a while.

This legendary place in Kolkata does not need an introduction. Every kid to grown-up in the city will have some or the other memory attached to the place and will definitely be nostalgic about it. Celebrities frequenting the place, movies being shot every now and then, and needless to say, the history that goes back to decades, each goes in making the restaurant a must visit eat-out destination. The place is always huss and buss with visitors and managing a table in 15 minutes of waiting in queue is no less than an achievement.
                                                                ...

Peter is Cat is a Calcutta Classic known for their Chelo Kebabs and sizzlers. I have visited this place so many times eversince I was a kid and I have to say the quality has gone down from before. The food is good, sure, but the standards have dropped. The Chelo Kebabs aren't as juicy as they used to be. I ordered a tandoori sizzler the last time I visited it, it wasn't up to the mark. But I enjoy the ambience here. It's quiet and classy.

What can one say about one of the most iconic restaurants in this city?? It's by far my favourite restaurant in the city and  I simply thrive on the chello kebab. Probably, they should just introduce home delivery, so that we can have Peter Cat food every single day!! :D Excellent ambience (especially the lighting) but slightly slow service.

Like I have already stated, the Kotharis' do know their food. If Ba-B-Q is a the proverbial cake then this, Peter Cat, is the cherry on top. Cosier than its cousin and perfecting in the art of continental and other delectables, one finds the ambiance and aroma enriching and enticing.
Keep an open mind and let the waiters guide ur olfactory neves through the culinary heaven. 
And as always, bin appetite...

One of the most popular restaurants at Park Street, this one is story gone sad.

We ordered Fish Farah Kabab, Chicken Cocktail Sausage, Chello Kabab and Chicken Steak. I found more negatives than positives.

1. The food were not that tasty. Even Chello has lost its famed taste.
2. Even before that, the hospitality is extremely poor. I mean it just sucked. The menu card provided was torn.

It's not that I suggest you not to visit there but dont have high hopes.

Today I went to Peter Cat with a great expectation. After returning to Kolkata after a long time this was the first restaurant  I tried. I went with my family.But my whole experience was awful. I went with 2 people. We ordered a baby-corn and Fish Makhmali Kabab. For Meal we ordered 2 Chelo kabab and 1 mutton streak. For desert we ordered, 3 full tuti fulti (there is a half one also available).

Pro- The location is very convenient. They have some signature dishes.

Cons-As I entered I felt the place needs a renovation. Chelo Kabab was average and tuti-fruti was below average. It was served in a normal glass in which they serve water in the restaurant. It sank my heart. Lastly, the hotel staff will behave as if you are not paying for the food, they are doing a favor. If you are paying by card then be prepared to pay a hefty tip. If not, they will not hesitate to insult you in their restaurant. When I complained there was no manager available. A person from reception heard our complain and apologize, which I do not think worth after ruining my evening with my family.I will not recommend this restaurant to any one after my bad experience.

Minimum waiting time is about 15 minutes during lunch hours.
Waiters are very polite and attentive.
Sizzler and Chelo are the dishes they excel in.
Dim light, humming noise of fellow foodies, hissing of sizzler, silent sacrifices of generous butter cubes- an altogether audio visual delight apart from your tongue's feast.

They are famous and legendary for their Chelo Kebeb platter. Their sizzlers are also nice. The staffs are bit rigid & over confident, may be cause they are legendary. Also, due to heavy rush, they tend to serve you cold Chelo on the weekends, which is not something you pay for. But the taste is to die for. Though the queue is always long, but it's worth the wait. Only if they work on the quality and maintain at least what they serve now, it will be sufficient to keep their name in the legendary section.

A must visit if you're in Kolkata :)

Peter cat is definitely one of the legendary eateries of Kolkata, no doubt about that!
But at weekends or special occasions one has to stand in queues for hours to get a seat. That is the most tiring part ...but the good thing about it is, it kicks the hunger to a new level...
Now the interior decor is amazing...with dim lights perfectly apt for dining. The staffs look great in their royal traditional attires with head gears as well...totally creating a heritable ambience. 
We ordered the famous Chelo Kabab, Biryani-ala-Kashmiri and Chicken Mayonnaise cold salad from continental.
Chelo kabab being served as chicken kababs on a bed of aromatic long grained basmati rice with 2-3 dollops of butter, half poached half fried egg on it with two long mutton sheek kababs.. The chicken kababs are tender and succulent..mutton sheekhs are a bit chewy n hard..loved this dish.
Biryani did disappoint us though.
The cold chicken mayonnaise though made my day...best among this lot...totally scored over me. :)
Finished the meal by ordering Pica Cosa. :)
We'll be coming back for more.
Highly Recommended!

I hope they go back the original dish with boneless chickens.

Decent food, but uncomfortable seating especially at the tables at the rear end of the restaurant. They are too too close to each other and gives you a stuffy feel.

I have been to Peter Cat many times but finally decided to sit down and write my thoughts about it. This is one Park Street place which has withstood the test of time while many of its peers have gone downhill. And the  simple reason  is well.. it is the only place in the world which serves Chello kebab!!

So much so that there are always queues in front and an average waiting time of 45 minutes whether you come at 1 pm or 3 pm or 5 pm .. doe snot matter.

For those that do not know or are visiting Kolkata for the first time , Chello kebab is a shaslik and a sheekh kebab on buttered rice and finished with a fried egg.. Sounds simple but whoever dreamt up this combination deserves an award..Most people who come to peter Cat don't order anything else . I think there is plenty said about the Chello Kebab so Id ecided to try out the Chicken Marrakesh and the fish Meuniere. The Chicken Marrakesh is very similar to the Chello conceptually with a different kebab and without the egg. The Fish Meuniere was good for one portion and for the other the fish was undercooked. We had also ordered soups which were extremely average.

On the whole this experiment reaffirmed popular perceptions around Peter Cat, go there for the Chello Kebab only ... Do not experiment

By the way, you may find the people who mange the waiting list fairly rude and the waiters not so friendly.. but take that in your stride , the Chello kebab is worth it !

This is another legendary must visit place for all people from outside Calcutta (everyone from Calcutta already goes there anyways). If you'r trying to make up your mind about where you should eat at park street. This is where you should eat. Start with the prawn cocktail, follow it up by the chelo kebab and chicken sizzler (chicken) or dum ki raan (mutton) and your good (also the tomato soups are gr8 and are a park street exclusive). After this meal you will need a Friend to carry you home because you will be high on food and probably be slurring or falling around the place. We all love you Peter c. Thank you for hanging around :)

Another most talk about places in the Park street, mostly overflowing in the week ends. Been there only once and the experience was so so. Tried out the flagship Chelo Kebab platter but it didnt live up to my expectation. The mutton kebabs needs to be a bit softer, the rice was ok. Then tried Fried Beckty with tartare sauce. The fish was fresh and good. The good part of the restru is that the quatity is good and the staff is excellent.

So the most talked joint has been explored and it was upto the mark. Ambience is good. But u have to wait for some time if going during a peak hour. Staffs were cordial. Loved its dim light..
Now coming to food... disappointed with it's Chelo kebab. Mayfair servers better in bhubaneswar. Rice was the spoiler. But both chicken and mutton kebabs were perfect. Smooth juicy and tempting. Quantity is good.
Loved chicken sizzler much more than mixed sizzler!! I didn't like the concept of putting so much gravy in the sizzler. But individually the the kebabs were well cooked.
Worst was the sandwich.. it sucked big time.
But I will come back again to have chicken sizzler as many time as possible.
They should initiate online reservation also..(atleast for some seats) 
Well done.
Extra 0.5 for the well cooked and juicy kebabs.

Been there today. The ambience is great but food was a bit letdown. I am not a mutton person so tried out chicken tandoori which was ok. The biggest let down however was the veg items like nentara biriyani and naan. Although i liked the veg begum bahar. Matar paneer was good so its a 3.5 stars from me

In a word, PERFECT!!
I visited Peter Cat in a crowded evening. Almost all of the tables were full, and I managed to get a table without waiting.
I have tried Chicken irani kebab, paneer tikka kebab, chelo kebab, paneer makhan masala, and masala kulcha. Everything was perfect. I still remember the tests. everything was so nicely prepared and every tests distinguishable. My dinner was perfectly complemented by a beer and a pineapple smoothie.
eagerly waiting to go there again.

Visited twice recently. Ambience decorations remains just like before.
I still remember, we went Peter cat just next day after Rahul Gandhi had chelo kebab. 
Famous dishes are awesome and should try everyone!
But, in last visit , we didn't find that aroma or taste in sizzler. Something was missing. One bad experience doesn't make any difference, hopefully. :)

Yeah finally I'm!!
If u haven't gone there yet then surely ur not a part of my kolkata..
This year i made my birthday-wish workout.
Perfect birthday dine out!!!
We had ordered fish makhmali for starter & it was just mouth-melting & delicious.
Then we had the butterly yummy chelo kebab & Smokey chicken steak sizzler..Mutton roganjosh & tandoori roti was equally tasty..
Loved all of them..

Last month we went to this place to celebrate our new-year party at night. This was my second visit to this restaurant. That day in morning I called the restaurant to reserve our booking. The executive on the other side replied that it does not have any reservation facility and getting into the restaurant will be first come-first serve basis. I planned that we would leave early from our place and certainly get a good seating arrangement in it and thus we need not to wait for the food. 

But I was absolutely wrong! We waited there for 2 and half hours to pass through the entrance of the restaurant. I was thinking the reason why Peter Cat being a good restaurant does not have any reservation facility or why do they not expand in size. They could have opened another branch somewhere else in Kolkata. My poor intuition suggested that the restaurant probably did not change the business pattern and policy to hold its tradition because Peter Cat is not a newbie in restaurant industry. Anyway, another idea came in my mind that probably they want to keep us waiting before the door because doing so, would manifold our hunger. So when they would allow us to enter into the restaurant, we would jump on the dishes and Peter Cat would make more profit from our pocket as we turned into hungry creatures few moments back. Ha ha ha! Somehow I managed to spend that 2 and half hours thinking all these non-sense!

Anyway, we ordered "Chello Kebab" and some sizzlers with bun. The foods were good and had a signature style of Peter Cat. It is well-known for its signature dish "Chello Kebab". Another thing I noticed that it has reduced the quantity of rice and probably kebabs (not sure!) in the dish from my last visit. It was not expected. The dish did not taste like the way it did in the first time. Anyway, we had nice experience in the restaurant. There is nothing to mention about the ambience and the hospitality of staffs as people already know about all these things and they expect a positive reaction from the restaurant side. 

Overall, I would request the management of Peter Cat to find some alternative so that people need not to wait outside for so long. And another point is - do not alter the quantity and quality of your signature dish - "Chello Kebab"!

After hearing loads and loads about this place, finally I went there two days back. With a nice ambience, the place is always high in demand. Luckily we didn't have to wait, got a table upstairs. We ordered the "legendary" chelo kebab and tandoori mixed grill. Firstly, for the chelo kebab, it was superbly "LUSCIOUS". Just loved it. For tandoori mixed grill, it was quite good. But the the prices for Beer was bit higher.
Overall, it was an excellent experience for the first time.

Too much hype about this place and the obvious reason was chelo kebab platter...  It was my bday and i wanted to treat my friends with this platter.... It was my first visit and i had extreme high expectations from this place.... 

Location(5/5): located right at the heart of park street,  you cannot skip this place because of its huge hoarding and obviously the crowd.... 

Food(4/5): i was already pissed off with the wait time... So finally when we entered, the ambience was superb... Dim light with orange touch... There are 2 floors of seating arrangement... We got the first floor... The food that we ordered was but obvious chelo kebab platter... For drinks we had strawberry shake, fresh lime soda... Both were the good... Nothing extraordinary.... The thing for which the place is known for was a bit let down... The kebabs were really dry.... I am not sure whether this is the same dish that makes this place so outstanding or was it only for that day.... My expectation just dropped.... For desserts we had brownie with ice cream which was surprisingly amazing.... 

Service(4/5): the service no doubt was slow but they were extremely nice to us.... 

The biggest issue i had for which i dropped my rating to 3 was when we were waiting for our turn the people in charge were very rude to us everytime we asked them.... This is definitely not expected from such a renowned place.... Please take care of this....

Located in Park Street.
Amidst the numerous restaurants in Park Street, this place stands out for Chelo Kebab.
Went for a Sunday lunch, so had to wait for our seats. We were a group of 6.
The ambience is nice with the dimly lit lights. The staffs were good. (oh yes ! They look legendary in their attires too)

Had the seating arrangements been made more comfortable, it would have added 0.5 more to their rating. (Good luck !)

Coming to the food, Chelo Kebab did wonders. :) 
Grilled fish and Chicken steak sizzler were no less. Yum ! Yum !
This place makes me gorge on food even more. ^_^ 

Would love to visit and see positive changes next time. Much love.

Peter Cat is one of those places which have achieved a legendary status over the times.. But ask me to describe this place in one word... I would say ....overrated(specially for chelo kebab)!!
It was my dad's birthday and to celebrate that we thought to pay a visit to this place..
Sometimes, we get an experience to remember and sometimes we don't.. we just pay bill and check out..

Upon entering,I kinda liked the dimly lit ambience.. Decor was posh and classy.. It was crowded so automatically resulted in slow service..

We ordered chelo kebab, cream of sweet corn chicken soup,naan,chicken reshmi butter masala.. chelo kebab was an absolute disappointment..(chicken kebab was okayish and mutton seekh kebab was a bit salty).Soup did taste good..Naan was soft and melted in mouth..And the Chicken dish was a sheer delight..Absolutely well cooked..This would be a sure recommendation from my side..Staffs were well mannered and pricing was decent..

But the question is ..Is it really worth the buzz?
Well,I didn't find the essence of Peter Cat that I have heard about so much..So, good luck with your experience..üòá

Surprisingly am writing this review after going to this place 3-4 times or maybe more. And the experience has always been the same, excellent. With its orange over hanging lights above each table, the ambience is quite nice. The staff & their services have always been top notch. Coming to the food, well it's awesome, as simple as that. The kebabs are fantastic & the sizzlers are really good. A dish that you have to order if you are here is their signature famous Chello Kebabs. Another thing that I really like are their 'vintage looking' beer mugs. Overall it's a fantastic place to go & eat and the entire experience truly makes it one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata. Cheers!

There's this person who had described this place and it's food in such a way that I couldn't have missed the opportunity to treat my taste buds.
I was given a fair chance of warning that the sizzlers out here are so tasty that on a any given day, a huge queue builds up infront of its gate. But still it's risk had to be taken and the food had to be served on my plate.
While our visit to this place, we had ordered chello kebab and chicken sizzlers. 
I was on my toes to jump on the food as soon as I saw the waiter coming in with the sizzlers and the kebab.
No sooner did the sizzler find its way to my table with it cracking sound, I didn't dpare a second and started pleasing my taste buds. The same to be said about chello kebab.
The food was awefully awesome. Awefully because it will leave you addicted.
Speaking about the ambience, it's a thumbs up.
The service is good as well and the important part, it's not too pricy and is worth every penny.

Peter Cat, I will come again with my partner in crime and we shall hunt every thing that you have in your menu down.

Thank you for the delicious food.

The place is awesome. The ambience is great. The Management people are doing a great job.
And now it's my turn to rate this place for the food it serves. Well, it deserves a 4.5/5 because the food is just too good.
Tikka kebab, that i had taken for starters along with beer was very tasty. The kebab was perfectly made.
For main course, we took the all time famous dish of this place -- chello kebab and with it, we took sizzler. Both of the dishes were just perfect. No complains regarding anything.
A perfect place to dine in.

But then it was only a while later I realised that  I shouldn't have taken the table at the back of the underground area.The whole place stinks of gin and tonic because of the bar.
The keema naan tasted marvellous.So was the Mutton Pishori Bara was spicy and perfectly complimented the Keema Naan. I didnt like the Masla Kulcha much though. 
P.S- Service was great.

Cat cat....Peter Cat is famous for chelo kebabs,city's best kebabs.The dish is garnished very well and served with care.I visited here in April,2015.Peter cat has always rush of their customers and maintain it properly.Yes,you have to wait for your mouth watering chelo kebabs for a little bit in the queue.The ambiance is just mind blowing and the staffs are nicely behaved.
Now the main part..Kebab is delivered with rice,butter cube,salads,mutton stick and really the platter can win your heart.The rose on the table adds extra sweetness in your mind and you will be just blowing with your first bite of kebab.I took a chicken starter also and that was also nice.

Being born and brought up in Kolkata, I have visited this restaurant for innumerable times. I love their chelo kebab which is a persian delicacy and no one beats them in town. Apart from this the chicken sizzler and other such delicacies are great. But typical Indian or mughlai dishes don't taste so great. But the light, ambiance and the feel beats everything.

I had sizzlers in different places. Must say their sizzlers are quite different.. People usually visit them for chello kababs and sizzlers. 
Unfortunately whenever I make plan to visit them I usually find a long queue in front of them.. That's why often I visit some other restaurants instead of having plan to go there..  Overall good experience. 
I recommend atlst once you should visit them..

In desert the creme caramel felt to be made of the packaged ones . We were served by an old waiter who mumbled something when he did not receive tips to his will/ Probably peter cat should check these old worthless waiters. deducted 2 points for the attendance solely

Peter Cat is my favourite restaurant and it's one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata.
Whenever we visit Peter Cat we have certain favourites that we order everytime:Chello kebab, chicken steak sizzler ,grilled fish sizzler and their brownie with ice cream.
However recently the quality of their brownie which used to be an all time favourite has deteriorated which is sad.:(
The brownie is hard and their special chocolate sauce is not that special anymore.
This is noticeable because I am a regular visitor and it's kind of disappointing.
I will still give it a 5 rating because you know, it's Peter Cat!

Updated Advice: so this is kind of strange but nowadays whenever I visit the place in the afternoon the brownies are hard and a bit burnt,  but when I go for dinner ,it's perfect. Weird!

This place is a must for people visiting Kolkata for the first time. The ambience, the atmosphere, the food is all too great.  the staff are tremendously helpful and love striking up a conversation over meal.  even their attire is a significant sight!  our meal consisted of the legendary famous "chelo kebab ". Had heard all my Bengali friends praise about this dish and finally I had the opportunity to try. It consists of 2 fish kebabs, chicken or Mutton kebabs with pieces of capsicum in Between (what you order),  slices of cucumber,  steamed rice with pieces of butter and a poached egg placed right on top of the rice. The chicken and the Mutton was cooked to perfection.. Juicy, tender and the spices were right on point. It was a heavenly meal.  The dimmed lights and the food made it a prefect romantic lunch for us.. Must try!  Can't wait to go back and have again!

Now what do I write about Peter Cat that hasn't been written before? The mecca for food lovers across the City of Joy, the nostalgia trip that every pureblood Calcuttan takes when visiting the city. The serpentine queues every day of the week, not just weekends, bear testimony to the never-waning popularity of this "heritage" restaurant.
Risking the ire of all those who swear by the steaks. mixed grill and the Chelo Kebab of Peter Cat, I have to say that I myself have never understood the hysteria surrounding this place. Not saying that the food is bad, no way so, but I don't find it spectacularly special to brave the hours-long wait. Never been too fond of the Chelo Kebab, but that's my personal choice, no reflection on the quality at all.
As for the steaks/sizzlers, I find them too Indianised, spiced up and sauced liberally to suit the palettes of the masses. I wouldn't want to take names but there are places in the city who do a far better job with steaks/sizzlers maintaining their authenticity, not tweaking them to suit Indian tastebuds.
So why have I given a rating of 4? Because nostalgia is a weakness few people are spared from. On special occasions, be it a birthday or a get together, more often than not, I have found myself wanting to go back to that familiar dimly-lit place, and partake of the House Special. Peter Cat will remain special for any true-blood Calcuttan and I am no exception!

This Iconic Legend only Brings Nostalgia to us. Our trip to Kolkata (Calcutta) is never complete until we visit this amazing restaurant. Not much has changed as far as the interiors are concerned. Same old Victorian decor.¬†

We are yet to come across a restaurant that serves as tasty and juicy Chelo Kebabs (and many other Kebabs, including the vegetarian ones as well) as this one. Dum ki Raan, Steak Sizzler, Chicken Baked in White sauce are few of the most favorites. No matter what you order...almost everything on the menu is Yummy! Ample of choice for the vegetarians too.¬†

4 for Food plus 1 for nostalgia...This is a Must Visit restaurant.

I and my friend went to park street and planned to visit this place. It was near 1 pm and we reached there. We had to wait for around 10 minutes. Ambience is very good. The staffs are very helpful and polite. We ordered their famous chelo kebab and tandoori chicken.. Both of them were awesome in taste. The chicken pieces were tender. And nothing to tell about the chelo.. I never had chelo kebab before, this was the first time. It was an awesome experience.
I will recommend this restaurant.

ORDERED 1)SCREWDRIVER
2) CHELLO KEBAB
AND 3)CHICKEN ROAST SIZZLER

OVER RATED..EVERY DAMN THING IS OVER RATED EXCEPT THE¬†
PRICES, WHICH ARE QUITE ARE REASONABLE..

You know that blasphemous feeling of underwhelm while finally savouring a dish that's considered a cult classic?I was terrified of that uneasy guilt before placing my order for the chelo kebab platter.I mean how good could an array of chicken kebabs and mutton sausages over a bed of rice be?But boy did it live up to all the hosannas sung about it.Surprisingly what really ties the dish together are the little knobs of butter melting under those warm lights.The house special sizzler on the other hand was a bit of a dampner after the legend but good nevertheless.No one does Chelo kebabs like Peter Cat.Period.

Peter Cat, Kolkata- The most sought after eating joint in Kolkata for decades now! 
Dum ki raan(Hyderabad mutton slow cooked for hours in an oven), is one of favourites here along with chelo kabab, Prawn cocktail and the steak(BEST IN TOWN)! Last night was the 'ritual meal', for me and Anand.

We were so full we couldn't move, but we always make space for #belgianchocolate ice-cream!

It's a heritage...one of the iconic restaurant in Calcutta.... U'd never see this place empty...it's always full and most of the time u'l find queue outside...The decor of the restaurant will give a very old world charm and makes u feel that its truly a legendary place...and surely make u fall in love with it ...it is said that their chello kabab is something every food lover should try before they die...well, I don't deny that fact either...i'v tried that recently and so I'll say the saying is  absolutely true.... 
**Recommended**

Peter Cat's warm and dimly lit interior speaks of history. Waiters look resplendent in crisp Rajasthani white and red costumes, which match the colors of the restaurant's interior but curiously contrast with its name -- a name that doesn't give away much at all. If you dig around though, you'll discover its the namesake of a famous cat who lived in Lords cricket ground in London from 1952 to 1964 (and Kolkata is a city addicted to cricket). The  Chelo Kebab( a Persian delicacy where kebabs are served with salty butter flavored rice) & Chicken Steak Sizzler alongside Mutton Biryani make for an amazing meal, with Drinks being served alongside in line with Cocktails & Regulars.

Chelo! That's the word which comes to everyone's mind whoever is aquainted with the name of Peter Cat. The words are synonymous, which also adheres to the fact that visiting Peter Cat and not ordering Chelo is not an option.

Right in the foodie posh area of Park Street, globally famous part of Calcutta for food and Christmas celebration, Peter Cat is a perfect hub for meat cravings.

Peter Cat is one example of 'what's in the name?' We went in expecting a western place serving pasta etc, ended up eating delicious Indian(Punjabi) food.
We went for a rather late lunch(330-4ish) on a Monday and managed to get the last empty table. (Imagine the popularity)

What stuck me most about this place were the unique choice of cocktails (and ofc traditionally dressed servers!)

A bit dissapointed. Had heard a lot about Chello Kabab but didnot like it that much. Individually the items in chello kabab are brilliant but overall the whole item becomes too dry. So for the first timers who want to try this item please be aware of this fact and donot just go after the hype. Having said that i still want to visit this place to try other items.

So I could finally make some time to write about this legendary restaurant. Coming from another city, I asked my friend to take me to a place which has it's own heritage and cult following. Undoubtedly, Peter Cat was the first thing he mentioned. ¬†Prior reservations are recommended if you're a group other than a family. The outset is gloomy with dim lights giving the place an ancient look. The menu looks very attractive and so do the waiters. Humbly waiting for our order, the waiter also recommended a few dishes. We chose the Vegetarian Chelo Kabab, Broccoli Cheese Tandoor (Something close to that) and another stake. The chelo kabab, is ingenious to Kolkata and is supposed to consist of 3 types of proteins. In the vegetarian option, we got served Paneer, Potato and Cauliflower (Wage remembrance). The butter rice accompanying these was out of the world. The simplicity of the dish was its own strength. The broccoli was served in a way I had never imagined, it was really tasty. They also have a whole range of fresh seasonal fruit juices which go along very well with the spicy food. Definitely recommending this place to any person travelling to Kolkata, and everyone in Kolkata who hasn't been here. Brilliant.

This restaurant is on a league of it's own. If you have no idea why they have huge queues on the road waiting, though there being other pretty amazing restaurants in the vicinity, The answer is- Chelo kebabs. !! If you're in Kolkata, and you haven't tried Peter Cat's Chelo Kebab, you haven't lived. Classic vintage ambiance, well mannered courteous staff, and the food is heavenly. This is the 2nd restaurant in kolkata entering my list of must visit on my every kolkata visit. (First being Flury's)

Truly this place is the pride of Kolkata. This is so popular that almost every time I went there, I have to wait for our turn as there is always a huge rush especially during dinner time and weekends. But the wait is worth for the heavenly chelo kebabs. Also, fish kebabs and sizzlers are a must try as they are also Peter Cat's specialities. Everyone should reserve their one night to visit Peter Cat when they are in Kolkata!

They are in a hurry to repeat snacks, drinks which kind of puts one off... What's worse is the fact that they hover around for tips and show their displeasure if not tipped appropriately ...

Alright so the much awaited visit to peter cat happened on a Monday afternoon and as usual there was a qeue outside the restaurant. We had to wait for 7-10 minutes we could enter and as our preference we got the upper floor. Nice sofa orange radiance everywhere so first impression turns out great. Coming down to food we ordered Budweisers and it was quite surprising they served good complimentary with drinks <most restaurants in the city just serving pine nuts which is disappointing.> Anyway main course had due to obvious reasons Chelo kebabs, tandoori roti, masala kulcha, matar paneer and a chocolate souffle.
Being a hard core non vegetarian all the veg dishes seem same to me no much difference here as well. But chelo kebabs really are over hyped in this place. Everything is just okay i tasted better kebabs at other places. Being such a talked about place customers deserve better i believe and of course paying such handsome amount as Bill. I didn't find anything extra ordinary with the kebabs. But having a tiny sweet tooth i have to love the desert and i did this time also. Souffle was amazing, melted in my mouth creamy texture in one word Awesome. Only for the desert and complimentary its a 4 otherwise despite of having the famous kebabs on the menu it would have been a 3 I'll go to taste the sizzlers next time hoping not to be disappointed.

First up, this place is exactly why this proverb was made - don't judge a book by its cover. The name, logo, lighting, overall ambience, dressing of the waiters, nothing actually makes sense and give a very confused messaging. But the food is what you should visit this place for. 

I am not going to write anything different than what many people have already written. 

This place is famous, and is rightfully so, for its epic dish - chelo kebab. The original chelo kebab (good for two) has mutton sheekh kebab, chicken kebab, one half fried egg and butter-rice. Although at first I doubted the necessity of the rice in the dish, the kebabs tasted heavenly with the buttered rice. Eat all the elements on the dish to get the rich taste the dish to offer. And now it makes complete sense why this dish is the national dish of Iran. The herbs used in the making of kebabs have them a very unique fragrance and flavour and it is very different from the kebabs you would usually eat. The only thing which could have been better is the texture of the mutton sheekh kebab, which was just a tad dry. 

We also tried bhetki meuni√®re and grilled fish sizzler. These two also, simply put, were out of the world. The sauce used in meuniere was outstanding. 

We also happened to try biriyani here, which was a wrong decision. 

Overall, a pleasant experience, but try not to be adventurous and stick to what the place is famous for.

This place was on my wishlist for a long time and finally managed to give it a visit during Durga Puja.As expected there was a long queue and we had to wait for exactly an hour to get our seats.The disappointing thing was that they did not make any seating arrangement for people waiting outside which other restaurants do during Puja..so we had to spend the entire hour standing outside which was very tiring. Coming to the food,we ordered-their signature dish Chello Kebab,& Chicken Marrakesh.Both the dishes were similar,but the chicken kebabs of the Marrakesh tasted much better than that of the Chello..mutton kebabs were average.Ambience is very nice & service was also good. Prices were¬†slightly on the higher side.Both the dishes were somewhere around 350 bucks. P.S-Though this place is famous for its chello kebab,try their Chicken Marrakesh instead as it tastes better.

The tag legendary goes perfectly well with this amazing restaurant. Starting from the ambiance, to service to the menu, everything is perfect. 
The chello kebab will always remain a staple dish here and the mouthwatering sizzlers are a treat to have.
Since the menu card is not here I will try to give an estimate range. If you are dining here it will approximately cost you 800-850 per person if you can eat quite a lot (excluding cocktail and drinks).
All in all an awesome experience to dine here.
As they themselves say their meat is cooked to perfect softness.

Nothing much to describe or appreciate about the food of Peter Cat. My all time favourite. The signature dish Chelo Kabab which brings me back here again and again. Just to share with my Pune food lover friends. ..alas! if I could get the same taste there as well !
People call it a Peter Cat lunch or dinner, yes that much is sufficient to describe a food craving personality :)
In this visit we had the traditional Mutton Chelo Kabab (metling fleshes) and fish sizzlers (original Vetki).

On my next week the waiter behaved rudely with us. He wasn't of any help in deciding what to order and instead showed attitude .. Am not going to visit here again!

Craving gastronomes shepherded to sumptuous Chelo Kebabs!

The interiors exude of warmth and happiness. The low hanging ceiling lamps are inviting. They want you to come and sit and eat in peace.

The Chelo Kebabs and Sizzlers are legendary. The Chelo is an excellent example of how simple things in the right proportions served elegantly can be extremely palatable. Boiled rice, butter, two sets of kebabs (Kakori & Reshmi) and a fried egg sunny side up, that's it, and tastes marvelous. The sizzlers are commendable too. Fish Makhmali Kebabs are highly recommended.

The service is good. 

Expect a long queue any day/time of the week. The alcohol menu needs to be updated, fast.

Food 4/5

Had this on my bucket list from a long time and I made sure I tick this one off the list when I visit Kolkata in 2016. Let me cut to the chase.The Bhetki Muniere and the Chelo Kebabs were surreal. We ordered a Mutton Hamburger steak with a bread roll in sizzlers and boy, what a thing 'twas to have! I had the Planter's Punch in cocktails but given the fact I have an aversion to Rum,I somehow got through the end of it owing to a good punch of juices. Amazing ambience and undoubtedly jammed to the rafters on any day so you got to wait to get yourself a sit but the wait is worth it.

Well i've heard a lot about peter cat.  And so i've always wanted to visit this place. But  when I at last visited the place I didn't actually find anything so special.. Well, the decorum is quite good, ambience is good as well. But the overall experience  was somehow not upto my expectations. I ordered chello kabab which i heard was famous in bengal at least.. But i tatmsted quite bland. We also ordered sizzlers which were not upto our expectations. So on an overall basis I found this place quite overhyped. Well, I would definitely recommend this place for others.. Visit the place. Its a good family restaurant.. But don't visit the place with too much expectations.

The ambiance is really soothing.
We ordered the very famous "Chelo kebab"and "Chicken Steak Sizzler" accompanied by glasses of Sweet Lime Soda.
Service was efficient.
Chelo Kebab was amazing.The Rice was surprisingly good.
Sizzler was out of the world too.Chicken perfectly cooked.
One thing we learned for sure is that You have to keep coming back.

Finally made it to famous Peter cat this year in spite of being a frequent visitor to the city. Loved the Chelo Kebab plates mutton and chicken. True to its reputation. Go for it if you want a high protein diet with minimum carb. Also loved the fish sizzler. I wish the ambience was more lit up especially for a winter lunch time. Sitting in dark corners with yellow light does take away some fun.

One of the legends of park street.. the place hasn't lost any of its sheen over the years.. it's great to see the familiar dark ambience every time I visit.. the chelo kebabs are still a must try.. and the soft fluffy naans and any chicken dish are still drool worthy...

Had the Chelo Kabab Platter that comes with rice- butter on top, chicken kabab, sausage, a sunny side up, & salad. Then I opted for Tutti Frutti Ice-cream, and Coke Float. The ambience was really good. Loved the food, and the place.

Good food but worst service probably among all restaurants in Kolkata. Don't go by name as the staffs are all ill mannered. No service and no ambience at all.

A legendary place, the name is enough. One of the most integral places, for which Kolkata is known. The house specials like the signature Chello Kebab, Chicken Sizzler, Bhetki Muniere have been a class apart since several decades. Hot Chocolate with Ice Cream and Pineapple Melba are my two most favourite desserts here.
Only thing which isn't good and commendable about this place is the behaviour of the staff.
Other than that,everything is class apart.

Peter Cat is noted for its legendary delicacies but I was actually both shocked and disappointed at the same time while dining there. We ordered Chello kebab,grilled fish,fried rice and chili fish. The Chello kebab was descent while the fried rice was below average. It left a bitter taste in the mouth and  prevented us from tasting any other dish. 
Such a shame!

A delight for all gastronomers. That's what Peter Cat is.
‚Ä¢
It was my girlfriend's birthday and to celebrate it we went to the legendary Peter Cat for lunch. The name Peter Cat makes my taste buds tickle for that delicious plate of Chelo Kebab. This classic restaurant still serves the same quality of dishes as they used to do many decades ago. You won't be dissapointed with this place for sure. The interiors are a bit dark with individual dimmed lamps hanging above each table. The interiors have a typical old school feeling and has its own charm.
‚Ä¢
Going to Peter Cat and not ordering Chelo Kebab is a crime. Thus came our plate full of Chelo Kebab. What a delicious sight it is. This thing always remains on top of the list for every foodie. The taste of that super fine rice along with the pieces of kebabs and poached egg is just a winning combination. Some say that this is the best Chelo Kebab in whole India. Not sure about that, as I haven't had Chelo Kebabs in all parts of the country but this one is definitely something else. Utterly mouthwatering, with the aroma of the steamed fine rice with a touch of butter and the explicably delectable Kebabs. What a meal.
‚Ä¢
Next we decided to order a sizzler. The sizzling Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler explains the specialty of Sizzlers at Peter Cat! Everything was super delicious in it. Talking about the service of this place - It was superbly fast. Everything came bang within 5 minutes.
‚Ä¢
Lastly we ordered Coke float which is a delicious beverage that satisfied our craving of a drink.
‚Ä¢
Peter Cat is a restaurant that won't ever dissapoint you for sure but one may have to wait for some time to get a seat inside because most of the time flocks of people gather to have their lunch or dinner at this place. Once you get inside, it is literally a gastronomer's heaven.

Heritage of Kolkata!!! My 2nd visit till date, and first since Zomato came into existence. Well, that's bcoz of the elongated queues that has always driven me away.
Coming down to the more serious matter!!!
For drinks tried ZAM ZAM (spoiler ALERT!!! - really really bad)
Chelo Kebabs - Tried the chicken and veg Chelo kebab, taste is still the same as they have really maintained their standard in terms of food.
Also tried the prawn cocktail. The quality was again dead drop similar, but alas, the quantity they served was equivalent to the tears I shed at the time of paying my bill.
On top of that my experience this time around was marred by the ambience or the setup, which is now even more cramped. And I sort of almost felt suffocating........

Peter cat is considered one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata and the hype about the place cannot even be measured in any terms. Every friend of mine has told me to go here and have their "Chelo kebabs" and sizzlers. So this time I did go and I had quite a disappointing experience i must say. 
Firstly, it was super crowded because I went during the Christmas week. The waiting list was about 45 mins long, and what's worse? People who know the manager and chef are randomly walking in and getting tables, whereas other people are just waiting and waiting for their turn to arrive. This sucks, it's absolutely unfair at least during the peak time when so many people are waiting and you just give preference to contacts. This put me off, then finally we got a table after quite some time. 
Upon entering, I kinda liked the ambience. Casual dining ambience, dimly lit and nicely decorated because it was Christmas! I liked the menu card also, unique design! 
So we settled to order, Chelo kebabs, chicken sizzler, crispy fried prawns, two screwdrivers and a strawberry mocktail. 
Half my interest was gone, when I saw the reactions on the face of the waiter and his impatience. I was asking him for suggestions, the look on his face was so disgusting as if he wants us to leave as soon as possible. He was so disinterested, with such a horrible look on his face nobody would feel like ordering food also. 
Anyway the food took way too long to arrive and clearly they were unable to manage the rush. The golden fried prawns didn't have any prawn inside, it was flat in shape and didn't even taste good. The cocktails came in tiny glasses, looked more like a normal orange juice. No sense of presentation or anything. 
Finally, came the Chelo kebabs. Decent enough, I've no idea why people go crazy about it. The presentation is good thankfully. It's chicken kebabs, mutton seekh Kebabs, rice with dollops of butter and a fried egg. 
The chicken kebabs do taste good, I liked the flavour. Even the seekh kebab tastes really good. 
Then came the sizzler, another disappointment. The sauce was normal sweet n sour sauce, no rice or noodles along with the sizzler. The chicken was chewy and the coating used kept peeling off. I've had far better sizzlers in malls of food courts. Really! 
Pricing is slightly on the higher side considering the quality of food served. Honestly, I've no idea what the hype is about because the food was absolutely not great. And what's worse is their service and hospitality. It's the typical Kolkata restaurant thing that the waiters behave as if they're doing a favour on you by serving you. 
Not going back here again, Park Street has far better places than this and people really need to make the right choice instead of getting carried away by the hype. 
Peter cat - some serious improvements needed!

Finally ticked off this legendary restaurant from my list. We went for dinner just before Christmas, and surprisingly we entered within 10 minutes. We ordered the famed chello kabab and chicken sizzlers, and I must say that was the best sizzler I ever had. Chello kabab was delicious as well. Overall a sumptuous dinner experience with my friends.

Visited this place with my family for dinner and we got a table after a long wait for about an hour. the ambience and the food quality is as good as usual . i tried out the prawn fry for starter and then moved on to the famous chelo kebab. due to heavy rush there was quite a lot of mismanagement . even after telling the order to the manager he dint note it down and after almost an hour we came to know that the main course order has not been placed. but afterwards the food was served really at a fast pace and i was happy with the service . but this kind of mismanagement from such a legendary restaurant is not expected .

We went to Peter Cat couple of weeks ago to have lunch. We went there early, so there was no waiting. Ambience is cool. Now coming to the food. We ordered the legendary chelo kebab. It was awesome. We ordered betcky muniere. You can definitely try it, hope you would like it. We had chicken sizzler as well. Overall, a place where I would like to visit often.

Dear All,
¬†Let me share my experience with you at Peter Cat Restaurant situated at 18A, Park Street, Kolkata.¬†‚Ä¢	Before you enter you need to enrol your name and number of heads even if you are going on weekdays. Weekends are subject to Luck.¬†‚Ä¢	Stewards standing outside the restaurant will then segregate and allot table as per their convenience and assortment. Bongs with families will be allocated extreme end at ground floor of the restaurant, Bengali couple again on extreme end and Maru‚Äôs with families on 1st floor and in front rows.¬†‚Ä¢	If you are lucky, then perhaps you get table in at the front row or on the upper floor, or else they will aim and assign table which will be at the extreme last corner of the restaurant on the ground floor.¬†‚Ä¢	The food is really good and has nothing to do with waiting or sitting arrangement experience. ¬†‚Ä¢	The Ambience is good provided you are sitting on the upper floor or in front row on the ground floor. But once are allotted a table at the end of the ground floor your opinion will change radically.¬†‚Ä¢	The Cutlery used are quite old and plates are fading away with the Peter Cat logos.¬†‚Ä¢	Some of the Table Napkins you might also find torn ones if you are that fortunate. I consider myself as lucky.¬†‚Ä¢	Overall experience is not very satisfactory since if you consider the prices it will almost cost INR 1200 for 2 persons. ¬† ¬†‚Ä¢	So all together Peter Cat is a Neglected, yet recognised Restaurant in Kolkata.

I visited this place yesterday for the first time with my family. We had to wait for around 20 min before we were let inside. The decor is beautiful with shades of orange all around. For starters we ordered Tandoori Broccoli and Peter Cat's signature dish, the Chelo Kebabs. The broccoli tasted just heavenly. The soft and tender broccoli florets melted into our mouths. I had heard a lot about Chelo Kebabs from my friends and yes, it definitely stood upto our expectations. The kebabs were delicious and the butter rice perfectly complimented them. For mains, we had butter naan, biriyani, afghani chicken, fish makhmali and mutton. The naans were very soft and tasted perfect along with the mutton and fish dishes. The biriyani was nothing special. It actually did not taste like biriyani but it was not bad either. The service was a bit poor. We had to keep calling the waiters from time to time. Overall it was a nice experience and I would recommend everyone to visit this place atleast once.

Love this place starting from the ambience to the famous mouthwatering must have chelo kebabs . I was there yesterday with my family for grandma's birthday celebration but they didn't allow us to cut the cake inside (which was a little disappointing cause this being a legendary restaurant , cake cutting should be something permissible ). Nevertheless everything else was perfect. We ordered a fish makhmali and two plates of chelo kebabs. Later we ordered nun and chicken reshmi butter masala. Yesterday FISH MAKHMALI and CHICKEN RESHMI MASALA stole the show. Fish was amazing and it melts in your mouth and the reshmi masala tasted dreamy. We ended our lunch with souffle and tutty-fruity . Overall a perfect birthday experience üòäüëç

Peter cat, one of the oldest and busiest stand alone restaurants at the park street Kolkata is my personal favourite. To start my meal I would always order the bloody Mary and directly jump to the main course of the grilled bhekti. The mouth watering cello kebab is a high recommendation as it has flavours and varieties in one platter making it the perfect order. The portion size is just perfect for any capacity though the ambience needs more light.

My hubby loves chelo kebab. Which means we love peter cat. This was our fourth visit. Of course we ordered chelo but we wanted to make some experiments this time. So we also ordered mutton shikari kebab and paratha too. Chelo was fantastic as always. And the mutton kebabs were mouthwatering too. Such a juicy and tender mutton kebab. Paratha was very different. A super tasty experience. Peter cat just made our day. once again fallen in love with the restaurant

During my visit to Kolkata I picked this place for my lunch and tried their famous chello kebabs with bunch of cocktails and finished it up with their special dessert. In all It was good but seriously not worth the hype.

No matter at what time you visit, it will always be crowded and you have to wait to get a table. I waited for around 15-20 minutes before entering this dimly lit yet impressive ambiance with beautiful decor and nice seating. The dining area is sure to impress with its eye pleasing components and even the menu is creatively done which gives an overall enchanting experience to your meal. Staff is also good and know their job really well.

I ordered Chello kebabs with cocktails. Cocktails were great and nicely done but the scarcity of strong ones in the menu is not a good thing for people who prefer their drinks strong. Kebabs were good too and were served very nicely with impressive garnishing with rice, seekh and egg topped with butter and salad. It was a complete meal in itself with great kebabs but seekh and rice failed to impress. Seekh had very dissatisfying texture with taste not pleasing at all. Rice were too plain and I would have preferred them with a bit of flavoring and seasoning. In dessert as suggested by staff I went for strawberry with ice cream which was nothing but strawberries served with a couple if scoops of vanilla ice cream and wafer. Honestly I was expecting more considering its price.

In all this place is great with really nice ambiance, great staff and delectable food but totally not worth the hype.

My Rating:
1. Food: 3.5/5
2. Ambiance: 4/5
3. Service: 3.5/5
4. Value of Money: 3.5/5

One of the must visits in Kolkata. It is usually overcrowded on holidays. We almost had to wait for an hour to get in. The best here is the chelo kabab and the mixed tandoor grill for sizzlers. The chelo was perfect especially the mutton kabab and the rice with butter on it. The sizzler was just perfect. We also ordered the iranian kabab which is also adds to the merits of the place. An advice to the people planning to visit this place be ready to wait for an hour . But the food is totally worth the wait.

Good ambience, extremely courteous staff. Sharp service. The chelo Kebab is the best dish on the menu and one must go just for that. The House Special Sizzler isn't special at all. The sauce is neither creamy nor spicy. More so serving boiled vegetables (meagre portions) along with sizzlers doesn't make any sense. 
If they make you wait for 1 hour or more, dine elsewhere.

Chello kabab - Legendary dish of this restaurant. Must have. Its just wonderful and you wont get this as good anywhere else.
Dum ki rann and sizzlers are also very good.
Ambience is great - better at the 1st floor. Staff very courteous & polite.

If you in Kolkata and not been here, you should be behind bars!! I usually visit Kolkata once a year and it's a family ritual to have a meal here. 
Chelo kebabs, their patent item in the menu is still a crowd puller and the quality has been maintained over the years. They don't take reservations and even on a weekday u need  to wait at least 40minutes for your turn. But it's totally worth it!!

Happy new year everybody! :) Atlast went to peter cat...probably the most crowded resturant in Kolkata...whenever we went there it was too crowded that we had to change our plan. After a wait of 45 mins we got our seat but I would like to say that if you are in a waiting queue be assured that the process is very quick. Coming to the decoration and ambience both are beautiful,classy,homely and aristrocratic...it has a old Calcutta charm in it. Staffs are very good and friendly. Food is fantastic and very reasonable. Apart from their signature dish 'chelo kebab' 'beckty muniere' is also very tasty..try it! Had a wonderful start of this new year with this lunch.

Practically I have spent half of my life at Park Street,and from the very beginning Peter Cat was the restaurant that was my all tym favourite.. One cannot point out any flaws for this place..its marvelous ambience, the meaty dishes and the quality of food served are beyond perfect..one could come here and realise that the 1 hour long wait was worthy enough

The one hour waiting time made me even more curious what's the hype all about. The moment I got in, I understood. The feel of the ambience, the service and the food were simply first class. The mutton chello kababs, grilled fish and chicken sizzlers were made to perfection. Definitely a kolkata signature restaurant.

So be prepared to wait for atleast an hour ( it took us 1hr 45 mins and a mini meal), to get inside. But once inside, its a pleasure to be served so well. Beautiful food, great service, good serving size , awesome ambience & a value for money meal. 

But before i go forward, let me tell you the chelo kebab for which this place is famous is overrated. Its a wonderful combination of unexpected ingredients, but trust me when i say this, i've had better kebabs at unknown places. So besides the let down on that front, the harem's chicken (i think thats what it is called) - with naan is amazing. the naan itself is beautiful, i could eat a bucketful. The chicken was slightly over cooked, but the gravy was to die for . The run mocktail being perfectly yummy was a pleasant surprise and so were the silver beer mugs. :)

To end the meal  - their meringue with chocolate sauce - its a full meal in itself  & tuti fruity ice cream.. a perfect round up. 

I'd say its worth the wait.

Peter Cat has got the legendary status in Park Street in Kolkata. It's an ok restaurant with ok food and manageble service. The kind of appreciation and limelight it gets, they are not doing justice to that. It was once a great restaurant. Just that they have not been able to maintain that. Nevertheless, you will find long queues on weekends so make reservations in advance.

The quintessential Kolkata hangout place. The queue might be huge turn off but good things happen to people with patience. I suggest try the prawn cocktail if you are a mayo fan with tomato base. The chello kebabs are definitely worth a try but the mutton kebabs could be softer. Try the tandoori aloo- stuffing to proper cooking, everything was perfect with this. You can add the pineapple blossom with this to complete the meal.

Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Butter Naan, Chicken Special Kebabs, Fresh Lime Soda, Ice-cream Cola, Fresh Strawberries & Ice-cream.

When you have perfectly cooked chicken kebabs with cheese on it along with your favourite drink, nothing like it for appetisers.

Butter Naan has always been my favourite Indian Bread. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was uber tasty.

Peter cat is my all-time favorite restaurant.The taste of food of this place is heavenly and its ambiance adds a romanticism in air.
Sizzlers are sizzling in taste while Chelo kebab reminds you of legendary food.The food quantity is satiable and the service is also good.
The only problem is that it always stays on high demand for all foodies,especially on occasions and as a result, it becomes too difficult to get a chance to dine-in on time.

As I begin to write this review the child inside me is devastated. Peter cat is right up there, with the other legends of Calcutta, or so I was told. 

My excitement was palpable, as I bounced around the entrance for over an hour before being ushered in- word to the wise : if there are more than ten names before you put your name down on the "list" it's probably going to be over an hour in waiting time. 

The first thing that hit me on entering the place was the dank carpet smell. Ignoring it, I proceeded towards our table, with a place that old such things become part of the charm. The service was prompt and soon a server engaged with us. His silken voice advising us on what to order. As a group we were pre decided on chelo kababs, however, I insisted on a mutton Cutlet as well  as I was famished. 

The mutton cutlet arrived and we attacked it like a pack of dogs, only to be bitterly disappointed. There was no salt. The patty was bland and it seemed like a chunk of fried meat. Not something you would like to ingest after the insane wait. We requested for a new batch and after another twenty minutes our food arrived. This one was a shade better with a hint of salt. At this point we didn't care. 

After polishing off the not so appetising cutlet we waited for another fifteen minutes before our chelo kabab arrived. An elaborately decorated plate the food looked inviting. As I dug into it, the mutton seemed ordinary but the chicken was succulent and for a moment our wait seemed justified. 

I was disappointed with the serving time, the general hygiene( bathrooms were terrible) and the food quality. I don't know if the hype around the place overshadowed the actual quality of food. But I was let down at discovering a mediocre place behind the screen of a magniloquent charade.  Peter cat gets a 2.0 from my end.

Located at the heart of Park Street, this restaurant bears a legendary place in the heart of people. Not only for the "Chello kebab"- the signature heritage dish served here, but also for the ultra sophisticated ambience that is sure to leave anyone delighted and mesmerised.
For those who are passionate about food, this place is something that they should give a try. 
A fantastic place to meet over dinner, be it with friends, colleagues or family.

Lived practically half my teenage life on Park Street but for some reason never tried this place out until recently. Went with a friend around 4ish on a lazy Tuesday and was lucky to find no queues. 
We ordered a Chelo Kebab and Chicken Sizzler for both of us and probably would have loved to order more had the staff been a little friendly. Probably the reputation of being one of the most sought after restaurant in Park Street has gotten into their heads. 
Anyway the dimly lit restaurant does add a bit of romantic atmosphere, which, like I said, is killed instantly by the staff.
The Chelo Kebab and Sizzler was presented extremely well and hot, perfect for the cold-dull winter weeks. The presentation was very good. The food, on the other hand, was good but not great.
My over all experience has been somewhat satisfactory. I have been hoping to go back again to see if I have a different experience since the first impression does not necessarily have to be the last one. üòä

No negative comments. Do try their Chelo kebabs and sizzlers because that's their speciality. And if visiting during christmas keep a note of the waiting time which is usually around 10-20mins.

To say I am disappointed with this place would be an understatement.

1) They wouldn't give us a seat on the top level of the restaurant even though there were seats. We had to fight to get those seats.
2) They forgot our drink orders and to refill the snack bowl which is complimentary with the drinks.
3) If you look at the photos I've uploaded, you'll see that the kebab sizes were TINY. My local restaurant makes kebabs which are bigger. Irrespective of the fact that it is the holiday season, when you charge more than 350 for a dish exclusive of taxes, you should meet up to the set standard!
4) The waiter was too busy trying to grease us to get a larger tip, and so he ended up taking away a kebab which was on the plate which he assumed was finished with. Such etiquette and mistakes are not expected from a restaurant such as Peter Cat.
5) The mutton pieces on the Mixed Tandoori Sizzler were UNDERCOOKED. We couldn't even cut through the piece of meat we were given.

All in all, it was a very bad experience during the holidays. Not something that I would have expected out of Peter cat.

Family restaurant. Middle Eastern food. Biryanis are good. The ambience is good. Service is good. Little expensive. But all good places are on the expensive side. Loved the copper mugs they serve you beer in. The food is little bland. I would prefer just eating the various biryani and tandoori stuffs there than trying out the other cuisines. Will go there again.

Had the Original chelo kebab and House special sizzler. Loved both the dishes. The waiters were the most courteous I've ever come across- this guy in particular, who's been there ever since peter cat's inception- that's 40 years! So I tipped him the same amount. I'd highly recommend this place to everyone.

Well nobody needs a direction for this old & famous restaurant in park street. Over the years this restaurant has served some really delicious signature dishes. Of late to me it seemed to be an over rated, over priced eating place much like mocambo. 
Went there on 26th & it was full. We were told that we have to wait for a minimum of 1 hour, however after an hour we were told that our name has already been called. The man writing the names was very haughty, evidently very proud that he works for the eatery but forgot the fact that it is the customers who kept the business alive. Management should teach him how to behave. 
Coming to food:we ordered mutton sheek kebab as starter, chelo kebab & grilled fish sizzler as main course. Very surprisingly starter &  main course came side by side. We cancelled the starter. The main course too was very ordinary. Chelo kebab-I had 5times better there than that one. Over all very poor service &  a very disappointing experience.

Obviously u don't need to see the menu if u know about this place. It's known for its chelo kebabs . And as expected of a legendary artist or restaurant it always delivers best. Like Rd Burma music never gets old however tym u listen similarly with this place. It's the taste u never want to reject at anytime.  Though ambience is bit dim needed my glasses to sign off but dere service is at par so dat dey cam accommodate all the ppl waiting in queue present on all days.  It's worth the wait bcoz the fruit earned with patience and most  time is best

Chello kebab is a must try and so are the sizzlers. I have tasted different versions of these two items across various places in India and trust me...they don't even come close.
So if you are at park street, you have to visit this place.

I don't know why people are crazy about chello kabab but I don't like the taste of these kababs.Actually I think many restaurants in Kolkata prepare good kabas than this & apart from kabab why do anyone pay 400/- for an egg & butter rice with some salads.We have to wait for almost an hour for the entry like we are entering in a security zone.Arsalan make far better food than this with lower price. I m giving 1 star for the ambiance.

I think the rating says it all!!. This is a very legendary place in kolkata famous for its chelo kebabs. Apart from chelo kebabs they have a very good menu to choose from. My personal favourites are the sizzlers and chicken liver fry. Drinks menu is also good. The ambience is very retro and thats what i love the most about this place. the only con is the hour long waiting queue outside the restaurant and its very difficult getting the reservations. But the waiting is worth the quality and taste of the food they serve.

We went there last saturday. This is the 3rd or 4th time we went there. We ordered chelo kabab and sizzlar with sweet lime soda. We had to wait 50min. But initially they told it will took 30 min. Their service was also not good. For sweet lime soda we asked for straw repeatedly. They not even served the water also. But food was good as expected. After all this mishap waiter was standing for tips at the time of billing. This rating is only for food.

Ambience is the first thing that hits you when you enter Peter Cat. There's just so much nostalgia, heritage, Kolkata-ness attached to Peter Cat that, being a Kolkattan, you just cannot give this place a miss. Dim lights, round tables, people speaking in hushed voices, there is a fantastic old-world charm, which is quite a contrast to the classy, modern Park Street environment. The waiters are always in full uniform, including a head garment as well.
Coming to the food, its no surprise that Chelo kabab was in order. There is so much hype about this particular dish that maybe my personal expectation was a tad bit high. Overall it is a good dish, although the mutton kababs weren't as delicious as i had been expecting. Other than that, you must try it. We ordered a Tandoori Mixed Grill which was average, to say the least. All in all, you must visit Peter Cat once, just to taste the famous Chelo kabab and to experience a cultural heritage at its peak, if not for anything else. Ting! :-)

The ambiance is amazing but everything that follows is just the opposite.

When we called for the person taking the order to ask about the serving size of the dishes, he rudely asked "Serving size means?" followed by "these are the main dishes and these are the side dishes" and walked away.

When the starters came, they were cold and slimy. By now most of us were so irritated with the rudeness of the staff and the disgusting starters that my friends decided to leave and get a table at the good old Bar-B-Q next door. We asked the waiter to cancel the main course order and get the bill.

What happens next is interesting. After waiting for 10-15 minutes we asked the waiter for the bill again but in return he came with the dishes. He said your dishes are here because you ordered them. We politely asked him that we wanted the dishes to be cancelled as the starters were really bad and that our friends had already left. He took away the dishes but the guy who took our order came back with them just to throw the dishes on our tables and to say "You have to take this dish because you ordered it." I asked him to call the manager of the restaurant so that I could talk to somebody who had some sense in him.

Meanwhile: All the tables around us were complaining about something or the other to the waiters. There was one table where a lady was complaining that she had ordered a fresh line sweet and sour but the drink was too sweet. The waiters were arguing that this was the correct recipe and that where was nothing they could do.

The manager arrived along with the waiter who was busy handing over the bill to me (which included the main course items we didn't eat/want). The person who had taken our order was also standing there arguing that it was not his fault. The manager listened to us and accepted that the staff was indeed rude and that they shouldn't have thrown the plates around like that. He asked the waiter to just bill us for the starters and we left.

The place is very old and very famous for the food but in my opinion, the popularity of the place has infected the minds of the staff there to be rude to its customers.

The Chelo Kebabs might be a famous dish on the menu but they would taste disgusting when served with such a bad attitude.

This place has the honour of the first 1.5 stars (just for the ambiance) rating from me on Zomato!

Going to Peter Cat is like going on a pilgrimage. Be prepared for the long, long, long queue, angry devotees who get more and more agitated with every passing minute, and a whole lot of expectations. From time to time you wait for a divine intervention that would perhaps speed up your entry from a mysterious list of names that seems to grow longer and longer. Anyhoo, Peter Cat is Peter Cat. There are those who love it and there are those who keep cribbing at the "deteriorated quality of food." I still love the place and harbour no such grievances. We always start off with some beer and we love the steel mugs they pour it in, and the chanachur with the pickled onions. Lovely stuff. We keep the starters very light and usually order the fish tikka kebab or the rajma gilauti kebab. We usually order the buttery, herby, amazing chelo kebab and the chicken steak sizzler as the main course. My partner usually has the chelo kebab and glares at me as I keep pecking and pawing at his plate. Can't be helped. All in all, love the place. :)

I have to say that ¬†I was not disappointed with the chelo kebab but not amazed too, may be i am not a big fan of Chelo kebab. Drinks were pretty awesome. Ambiance of this place was just breathtaking, nice and cozy. I am surely looking forward to visit again and try out some different food.

Peter Cat, the name is enough to describe its popularity. One of the legendary restaurant on the heart of Kolkata. One free advice for foodies (like me), if u really want to  try their legendary items then go before 1 pm. Cause whenever i vsisted their after 1 pm i faced a huge queue. You have to wait at least for 40 to 50 mins to get into the restaurant and take 30 mins to get your food right front of you. So on an idle Saturday i made my mind and reached their by 12.30 and luckily there was nooooo queue outside the restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome..little dark and touch of orange will snatch your heart. We ordered 'Chello kebab ' and the mouthwatering 'Meyoneze Chicken'. Sooo yummm. A must try dish

Had to wait for around 40mins before I got my seat, after that another 30mins before food was served. Till that moment I wondered "why in the world ppl stand a cue for this place". As soon as the food was served and my tongue got the first flavour, kaboom!! Amazing taste, brilliant flavours. The spices are mixed so well, amazing. I would have given a five, only if the service were a little better. But otherwise, excellent!

Totally worth the hype! Being from Mumbai, I only eat at restaurants in Kolkata based on ¬†Zomato reviews. I was there yesterday early evening and had to wait for 20 mins before getting a table but it was worth the wait.¬†
Loved the Original Chelo Kebab - the rice is brilliantly buttered and the egg is perfectly cooked. The chicken kebabs were well cooked but a few were burnt and black. The mutton kebabs has the right flavours but were a tad dry. Overall, I would eat this everyday and Peter Cat will be on my list for all Kolkata trips. I am not a big eater but managed to finish the entire serving and didn't feel heavy so the quality of ingredients must be fresh and amazing.
The one big problem is the waiters are hovering around the bill and keep staring while you are tipping. The restaurants needs to train them to allow customers to tip as per convenience and not under pressure! :)

The most important part of dining here is the name of the place itself...A name without which your dining experience in Kolkata can't be complete. And what sours above the taste and flavour is the charm of Park Street dining...the old house phenomenon! The Chelo Kebab has its own brand value. The only thing I feel they should improve on is their cutlery.

The place has vintage value. You cannot say you have eaten at Park street without mentioning your expirience at Peter Cat. I have been there quite a few times and the dishes to definitely try are the Chello Kebab and the Chicken / Mutton Steak. 

The Prawn cocktails also are delicious. The one thing that you have to bear with is the waiting line and the que but given the place's reputation. I believe that is something we can deal with. All in all great place and great expirience

Needless to say, any foodie in Kolkata would've visited this place. I've been coming here since childhood and the experience just gets better every time. Their sizzlers and chelo kababs is simply out of the world. Ambiance wise, they've maintained the old charm of the place. Service is good enough. Peter cat is definitely the 'pride' of the Park Street Area.

Well, due to a very special friend, I get a special treatment in one of Kolkata's most famous restaurant. He allows me to reserve a table even though the restaurant has a strict first come first serve policy for it's customers. I need not say much about this restaurant since most of Kolkata plan to eat their meals here with an average waiting time of about an hour (which I can bypass:D )The chello kebabs should be enough to make a lasting impression.

Peter cat- the most sought after restaurant in park Street. We had to wait outside to get a table for three on a Monday evening, that speaks volumes about the popularity of the restaurant. We only ordered for a chelo kabab and a veg sizzler. Talking about the chelow kabab. It was a delight to see a plate full of butter smeared rice, a spread of paneer tikka, a tandoori Aloo and two pieces of seekh kabab. Tasty would be an understatement for the dish that they are known for, and rightly so. Probably one of the best vegetarian platters I've had lately. Everything about the dish was so perfect that iam falling short of words to describe it. However the sizzler was a huge disappointment, atleast according to my taste and the ones who accompanied me.
Overall, definitely recommended for their chelow kabab.

Writing a review about Peter Cat is more for venting my satiation for the restaurant than providing information for the readers. I have forgot to keep count of the number of visits to the place. Never have I been disappointed with whatever I have ordered. Right from Sizzlers to Steaks to Chelo Kebabs, everything is worth trying.

I'm writing the review after visiting the place for the second time... their chello kebab is very interesting,tasty and filling, it has mutton kebab, chicken kebab,poached egg and rice with a cube of butter. Other than this I ordered mutton rogan josh and pulao which were average in taste and quantity. Overall a good place to visit with family and friends...want to try their other popular dishes in future.

Does any one need to say anything about this restaurant ? No.It is the one which must be visited by anyone and everyone who visits calcutta. To be honest Peter Cat has become a heritage,a tradition.
Take a house special steak sizzler with some beer and One Chello kabab thats it you are assured to fall in love with the place.
Peter Cat is the most pocket friendly restaurant in the whole of Park Street.
You'll get to know about its unending fame once u get there,always jampacked and queued up irrelevant of the day or any festival.
The hype for Peter Cat is a positive one,and it satisfy you to bits and peices.

Thumbs up : Chicken Tikka Kebabs. Nice and tender, the kebabs were perfectly cooked, but the pieces were too small, but that's fine.
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was another dish that tasted pretty good, even Chicken Curry was delicious. 
Now, let's talk about the pathetic stuff, Virgin Mary, don't you dare taste that. It tasted exactly like a tomato juice, it simple words it tasted yuck.
Overall it was a pretty good experience, the staff wearing pathani takes you back to the old days.

It was altogether a symphony that my tastebuds experienced - exploding, cuddling, cajoling all in an intimate Raphsody on a gastronomical call - it was all that I could ever hoped for. This was not the Peter Cat I used to frequent during the eighties; it has matured to an existence of dining delight on super duper possibilities. What was unbearable was the waiting.

My venture into this food joint was quite late going by the heritage value of the place, being so famous for so long. Did not disappoint nor did it excite. Having visited some Persian restaurants already in west Europe, I can't be very generous to the much famed Chelo Kebab. It was okay not spectacular. Although the house special sizzler was quite a treat and saved the day!

One of the most reputed place during our childhood days. Hence went back there again to relieve the childhood memories.Alas! It was tad disappointing.We didn't have to wait long to get a seat but we had to wait to get the foods served.. The awareness and comprehensive capability of the waiters were way down from the expectation. As always we did order Chello Kabab, but it didn't taste as good as it used to be.. Overall it was disappointing..¬†
Sincerely wish that they should improve the quality of the service to maintain their reputation

Went to Peter Cat after a long time, and find nothing has changed in the context of utterly rude behavior. The food was okay, nothing extra ordinary, but the cocktail was good. However, there usp these days seems to be the uncalled for and exceptional rude behavior. Due to some weird customs, they did not let us cut the cake. This was my best friend's birthday lunch, so it was sort of ruined. But that is not all. As i reached late, my friends have gone in and saved a place for me. I told them that at the gate, and they very reluctantly let me in. Inside the place, while i was looking for my friends, they were not at all friendly. they behaved in a way that I have somehow jumped a queue or was going to run without paying. then while we were ordering, they were not very hospitable either. So I will not recommend this to anyone I know. There are a lot of better places to eat in Kolkata these days, the food, ambience and people being far better. next time we will give the cat a skip!

After waiting for almost an hour we got our place inside today!!!

However, this time the waiting time was unbearable...

Ordered their beaten to death signature dish - Chello Kebab & Baked Broccoli with Cheese- my non-vegetarian friends ordered the non-veg Chello Kebab & Irani Kebab & PeterCat assorted Kebab platter.

Somehow I didn't enjoy the CK this time...something was missing I felt...Baked Broccoli with Cheese was a good try.

Needless to say- because of the quantity served- we were all overfed by the time we stepped out !!! 

May be because of the rush, service was little delayed this time. 

Still, the legacy of this place leaves you with such a hangover, it draws you back time & again !!! ü§ó

The high ratings and the long queue were truly justified when I tasted the food. The Chelo kebab is magnificent. Dum ki Raan was exquisite and was like nothing I've tasted before. The ambience is pretty chic and it is dimly lit which makes it a perfect place to hangout at the end of a long day.

Had tried around 8-9 veg dishes along with different varieties of Naan and kulcha and all were equally pathetic, except for the Garlic Naan. The service also was very slow with grumpy looking waiters !
Since it was a friends bday, we had gotten a cake which we were not allowed to cut inside the restaurant, something which is allowed by all the other restaurants, so it was a very sour experience for us, as the food was bad and the cake cutting also couldn't happen. Besides their pickles served on the table were rotten with fungi. Never going to this place ever again.

How can you not fall in love with this place? It's undoubtedly one of the best restaurants I've ever been to - and one of the best preserved ones too in terms of its legend, the ambiance and the vintage look n feel of the place, the staff, etc.
It was quite crowded and there was a lot of waiting as it was Saturday night - but we were two and luckily got seated instantly. So we ordered the original chelo kebab, and veg. steak sizzler - both finger-licking good (even though I'm not much into non-vegetarian food). Plus, servings are generous and service is really good as well.
Overall, great place for a scrumptious meal in Kolkata! :)

So we a group of 3..... All vegetarians ..... Probably we should have read the reviews before going to peter cat...... Anyways after 2-3 people recommended we went ahead and were told there was a waiting for 30-45 mins.  When i told the usher that please write down my phone number and give me a call, he outrightly said no and when i asked for the restaurants phone no the same again was conveyed to me, i probably have been to all the places in Delhi & Gurgaon, and most of them do better business than peter cat, still they take the guests phone numbers so that they can be informed. Its not that also that peter cat provides a good waiting area to the guests. STILL after waiting for 40 minutes we went and ordered. So first comes the waiter with glasses in his hands and don't even bother to serve water. Simply puts the bottle on the table and leaves. Then comes the soup. Pathetic. As if drinking a watery version of tomato ketchup and that too a local one. Sizzler comes next and all i can see are some unrecognisable pieces of some veggies all covered with gravy. Could not even make out what i was eating. So we thought it is not good for vegetarians so we asked the manager to cancel our food order, first he accepts to do so, then tells the old grumpy waiter to get the order cancelled, the waiter tells him to do it on his own and he then comes to us and says that we cannot cancel the order.  So thinking that food items might be ok, we tell him to serve the food. So we are served plates from the next table where people are already sitting. On complaining he tells us that he kept him on the other table by mistake and the plates were actually meant for us. Next the food comes and the old grumpy waiter puts all the pieces of breads directly in our plates thereby making a choice for us himself. So we already had decided that if the food is not good we will probably get it packed and give it to a beggar so atleast some good comes out of this ordeal. Finally we tried eating but could not ( it was simply not to our taste) so we tell them to pack the food and get our bill. To our surprise ( actually after this service we should not be surprised) they had charged us even for the aluminium foil and carry bag. Coz we did not want to create a scene and get to a nearby Mc donalds as soon as we could, we paid the amount, the waiter returned the change and i dont know why i still left some change ( about 20-25 Rs) with them, then to my disgust the old grumpy waiter agains mumbles something as if i committed a crime. In all the best thing out of this experience is that a poor disabled man got a full meal.

A place were good food and the long queue goes hand in hand. This restaurant has only one con and that's the waiting time. 30-45 mins minimum. Try to have a lady in your group as they make families wait for a less time. Now our order was original chelo kebab, chicken steak sizzler and dum ke raan. All of them are their signature dish and they are really tasty. Once in a year you should visit this place.

Ambiance is decent and classic type.
We have ordered dum ki raan, fish makhmali and chicken marakesh in starter,and the taste was soo good,specially dum ki raan is mostly recommended.
In main course we ordered roast chicken sizzler and off course the chelo kabab and the its tates too good.We also ordered chicken reshmi butter masala,afghani chicken and tandoori roti which is little disappointing.Overall its a must visit and i suggest all to stick with the continental dishes because i think if you are looking for good noth indian then you have many other choice.
Ambiance : 3.5/5.0
Food : 4.5/5.0(only because of continental dishes)
Service : 3.0/5.0(some of the waiter were not well behaved)

Despite having lived in Kolkata for 22 years , I have dined out at Peter cat just twice. This review is based on the second experience.
After returning from Hyderabad, I visited this place to re-try their chelo kebabs. It was as mouth watering as it was 3 years ago. This time I also tried the mixed sizzler. It was too saucy for my taste. Moreover, it included a fish and chicken liver also which was a little appalling. I will probably never try it again.

In terms of the decor and ambiance, it's as classic as it has always been. A landmark both geographically and in the books of a food lover. In terms of service the place is a 4/5. They serve the food pretty quickly in spite of the great demand during rush hour. Also, this place is ever crowded and there will be some waiting time before you can actually enter and eat.

Another point about the cordiality of the staff; I had left behind my debit card there (by mistake) and they had kept it with the manager after I called them up. I was allowed to collect it the following day with ease. So, immensely thankful on a personal front!¬†

So, if you can condone the minor downsides and want to taste dishes that have been heralded in the annals of time , do visit Peter Cat!

The dishes are innovative but the quantity is way too less for the prices charged! But this is probably the one place in Kolkata that offers unique food,something that iv not had anywhere else specially the Chelo kabab! The butter rice along with kababs and egg tasted heaven! 
Rest everything is very usual and don't order chicken tikka it u dislike sweetness in food :/
I feel they can really increase their quantity to make it more appealing!

Peter cat is the heart of park street .

Legendary and fabulous.

After like 2 years yesterday I made up my mind to visit it again ,
I've been discovering new eateries so much that I almost forgot to drop in here .

Its just the same as it was years ago.
The ambience reminds of my our beautiful childhood and yearly Kolkata visits.

So coming to the food ,
As I was already full , I just wanted to taste chelo kebabs after so long .

I ordered chelo kebabs, cold coffee with cream and Carlsberg.

‚Ä¢Chelo kebabs were amazing. Both the chicken and mutton kebabs were soft and mouth watering. It was served with butter rice , egg poach and burnt tomato.

‚Ä¢ The cold coffee with  cream was the best thing I had till date. You wont get the tasty in any of the coffee shops in Kolkata. It was totally creamy with a dash of bitterness of coffee. I give it 6/5

It was a soothing eve at peter cat.
I decided to visit our legendary restaurant at least once in a month from now :)

A very favourite restaurant of mine in Park Street area in terms of quality of food . Special mention about Chelo Kebabs, Sizzlers, Reshmi kababs. Among very few places in kolkata, they serve beer in white metal old school beer mugs. For vegetarians there are huge number of options in every segment , to mention specially- broccoli tandoori, veg Chelo kababs, lot many sandwiches. The liquor menu is again a very interesting one.
The things that are known to everyone but nothing is done by the management are- 
1) seating along the walls in the ground floor is very uncomfortable due to paucity of space.
2) customers are made to wait outside in a manner that is not a very nice sight to watch.

Going out to eat just anywhere and eating at Peter Cat were two entirely different things as i was growing up. Coming out to eat at peter cat was kind of a big deal then. For me at least! But i went there a couple of days back and realized that the food has become very ordinary with the rise if so many other extraordinary restaurants today. It breaks my heart to have to write this review but for the money i spent the other day and the food i was offered in return,this had to go out there sooner than later.

The first time I went there it was a memorable time. Things were perfect and had a real good service. The food was good too, not exceptional though. But later wen I visited there things were changed. I believe they have changed their staffs or they might have completely gone mad. Disaster service, food was ok so we thought to let it go. But in the end wen we were wbout to leave and only the kids, with us was finishing their desert, one waiter came and rudely asked to either sit back at the chair or vacate the place. I seriously never have faced such in any corner on Earth. They seriously need to check and improve their service and they should know ppl likes the place and thats y they want to bethere even after spending hours in que. And that doesnt give them any right to misbehave with their customers. Couple of my frnds also did face the same there and after that we have not visited the place for a long time. Truly will miss the place but cant really ignore the bitter experience.

Peter Cat serves ordinary food, made extraordinary only when one adds nostalgia and old colonial hangover in industrial quantities to make up for the mediocre food. Not that nostalgia is a bad thing, but if one doesn't have those associated memories, one gets just average food and that can be slightly disappointing !

The famous chelo is good kebab, though today my shekh kebab was a tad dry. Best out-of-the-world kebabs ? No.

The chicken steak sizzler is a piece of steak with potato wedges, carrots and beans, soaked in a sweet, brown sauce (don't be French and try to understand the sauce!). If you have a slightly diverse pallette, ignore. 

My final suggestion ? Go to Mocambo ! Same owner, same stuff and much better food.

Chelo Kebab is what you go for. And it will not dishearten you even one bit. Ambience is no doubt very good but well make sure you either avoid this place in weekends or holidays because it is worst hit during the rush hours and you might die of hunger standing in a line, outside Peter Car!

I had been waiting for this day to visit the most famous restaurant at Park street i.e. Peter cat. We had to wait only for 10 mins to get the seat,just a lucky day for us üòä
The ambience was just mind boggling. Let's get back to the food, Chicken Asparagus soup which was just average. Chicken tandoori was surprisingly soft and it just melted in my mouth(kudos to the chef) and the taste of it was different from all the restaurants out there. The Chicken steak sizzler and the Chelo kebab doesn't need any explanation. Have been hearing praises about these from everyone and it certainly met the expectation. A must must visit places for all the foodies. Good food good lifeüëç

Peter Cat was a puja destination for me. As it was the pujas, we had to wait for entering. However, after the food was served, it was well understood that the wait was worth it.
The ambience of Peter Cat is quite cozy with dim lighting. It sets the mood for a close, comfortable dining experience, be it a romantic one or with your family (as was my case!). Moving to the swiftness of the service, there's no complaints there even. The food was served up within 15 mins of placing the order.
Now, the food served over there is generally high end. Items served are generally chracterised by flavor in Peter Cat rather than spiciness. The Chelo Kebabs and the sizzlers were out of the world, so much so that we went ahead and ordered a second plate. Even the foods that are not the trademarks of Peter Cat, are tasty to a fault.
Granted that the pocket pinch cannot be overlooked, but it's definitely worth it. Satisfaction can be granted in the restaurant. So, definitely go for it!!

The crispy chilli babycorn that was served to us was everything but crispy. It tasted like lumps of flour around a tiny piece of corn,more full of capsicum and other vegetables than of babycorn. The quantity too was infinitesimal for 200 bucks. Not a very good choice for me.

A legendary name in the list of restaurants in Kolkata. We had tandoori chicken. The chicken was so delicate and tender. Nowhere I had chicken tandoori that is so soft. Next we had fish sizzler. Very good in taste. And chelo kabab, perhaps the flagship dish of the restaurant, delicious.

I love this place for the food. The experience was nice though it was a little unusual. I visited with my colleague from other state who came for work to Kolkata. It was Friday night and we reached around 10pm. All of us were male and the restaurant manager told us to wait for 10 mins after which he would tell whether we have place for 6 males or not. After waiting for 30 mins, we were given a table and as soon as we were inside, the manager and other staff was rushing for order and told us that it would be the last order and we have to order starter, drinks, main course, dessert all in once. This was weird and they were not flexible (pretty unusual) - it would have been better not to allow inside the restaurant than ordering everything at the same time without flexibility to add more dishes to our order. Hope they are more cordial and customer friendly next time.

The ambiance is beautiful and the staff here are polite and well behaved. The only bad thing about this place is that you have to wait at least 20-30 minutes. But trust me its worth it. The ambiance and the food is worth waiting üíó

An all time favorite restaurant! And I keep coming back for some more delicious eatables!

Peter Cat serves Persian cuisine. It is one of d best place, I hav been to. Its remains crowded during d rush hours, but d inside is wel decorated and nice. First and foremost try out d Chelo Kebab, its d speciality there, if U dont try tis ur visiting Peter Cat is futile. 1 Chelo Kabab plate would suffice a person. The rates r reasonable, staff behaviour is good. Try d Persian cuisine rather than d Indian ones.

Visiting Peter Cat since the time when Chelo Kebab was 80 Rs. I have been here uncountable number of times with friends and family.

It is always a tough time to get in as almost all the time all over the year there will be a queue to enter and therefore you need to register your name and later you get called when a table becomes available. Thought little time estimates for the waiting time is provided and mostly I found them to be inaccurate. I generally tend to visit them in a very uncommon time so that the queue is either empty or very short. Weekdays noon time or afternoon time on a non-festive season worked well.

After entering without going through the menu book we will either order a Chelo Kebab or the Chicken Marakesh. These meat platters focus on the different kinds of kebabs to be eaten with rice and butter. I like the stuffed capcicum which comes with Chicken Marakesh. The important thing to note is these are consistently good. We also tried kima naan and Harem's Joy and found to be pretty good. As a starter ordering chilli babycorn has become a ritual. The Mutton Shammi Kebab and Fish Makmali are pretty good too. Though we also get the sizzlers time to time. I found the Grilled Chicken sizzler to be very nice.

For the vegetarian only people, they can try the Vegitable Chelo Kebab. The chicken kebabs are replaced with ample amount of paneer grilled in a sheek, and mutton kebabs are substituted with vegitable preparations.

Bottom line, this is a heritage restaurant and a place to have a solid and legendary kebab platter and sizzlers. Always at one of the top places in my list.

This restaurant needs to review to prove how good food they serve. The foods,the ambience speaks of itself. Though the biriyani which they cater is not so good, but the continental dishes compensate it more than enough. The chelo kebab and chicken Steak sizzler are my all time favourites.

The ambience is too good . Starting with cocktail it was upto the mark. The place is famous for it's 'chelo kebab' and it keep up it's name. Then followed by some tandoori chicken, it made a perfect lunch for me. The place is too good to take your family out and have a nice lunch with them. In short a must visit place.

It's a crime to be a foodie and not yet tasted the legendary chelo kababs of Peter Cat!! Situated in posh food hub of Kolkata, this place stands as a landmark in Park Street. It was on a Sunday,us friends visited this place for lunch and after waiting for 30 minutes we got a table. Even though we were almost salivating at this point, it was impossible not to notice the ambience we were in. This place held the old Calcutta charm, it witnessed the evolution and integration of Western cuisines in India.
We started with cold chicken salad which was tasty and enough for 3-4 people, with pineapple juice. In the main we had the Chelos and it was even better than we expected! Let me start with the fact that you don't need an appetizer if you decide to have Chelos, one plate is huge enough to finish already. Now about the taste....the buttered rice and smoked vegetables are heavenly, and the kebabs were juicy, succulent and with a taste that is completely out of the world. Don't confuse them with the Mughlai cuisine. They're unique and you get to taste this delicious creation only at Rs 334!
I do have a problem with couple things; service is extremely slow. Even though I admit it was the weekend rush, but it didn't justify the 40 minutes interval between entr√©e and main. An advice to fellow foodies, do not order mocktails in large. The large quantity which they claim isn't large at all and is a complete rip off!
Overall, you can overlook every fault of theirs because of the food. Do not miss out on this, experiencing Peter Cat is experiencing Kolkata....sorry..Calcutta!?

I can review this place with impunity knowing comfortably that whatever I say will have no effect on its popularity, as its a historical restaurant tourists like myself will continue to flock to for the experience if nothing else. 

Dimly lit and oozing with vintage if slightly seedy charm, the interior is exactly what you would expect from a restaurant of its time, and I'm surprised no film has been set there yet. The cocktail list is amusingly witty with a wide range of options, but I tend to stick to old monk in Indian bars. The drinks are largely quite reasonable, a pleasant surprise for such a tourist trap. We ordered a veg galotti kebab to start, which was fine, nothing special, and the chalo kababs as a main, chicken and mutton mix, again, nothing special. I could say that in general about Peter Cat, not bad, not great, just okay. 

But its worth a trip for a drink and to gawk around and feel like you are in another time. And it's far better than Macambo where we tried to eat and were baffled by the rude unhelpful staff and ongoing construction during dining hours which motivated us to leave after cancelling our halfhearted order. If you are going for an institution, Peter Cat is the place, although it might be better to have the full meal elsewhere.

They don't take reservations over phone. So you need to just go and keep waiting till Ur turn comes. We waited for around 50 mins till finally we got a table. It seemed too congested. There was hardly much gap in between two tables. I dint like the sitting area upstairs. Waiters too pushy for taking orders ..dint even give much time for us to decide. After hardly 10 mins he came over and said "eto bhebe labh nei (don't think much)..take this take that" . I dint like their attitude. May be its coz of the crowd or whatever..If u can't handle crowd , then close the restaurant when u are full. You just can't try to do away with one family asap so that another family can take the table before entry closes. Quality of service has degraded over the years ..I would say. 
Coming to the food.. Since he dint give much time for us to decide..orders went all wrong. I dint like their biriyani. Chicken sweet corn soup was fine. Wanted to order chicken steak sizzler but ended up ordering tandoori mixed grill sizzler.. Which wasnt much good. After all this , I ate chelo kabab very half heartedly..I know that's the pro of this place. According to the waiter's reco  we ordered Mutton rogan josh which got wasted.. None of us liked it much. Given time , I would have ordered dum ki raan which many people recommended. Anyway naan was very soft and good. So in the end I just chewed  only naan without any side curry. Had a blah experience this Durga puja time. May be things are better on normal days.. Then I would say don't go to this place during occasions since they canNOT handle pressure.

One of my favourite joints in park street area, and everyone must try their chelo kabab once in their life tym. Their sizzlers were also quite good but chicken biriyani was a disaster especially when you are spending more than what you normally spend on biriyani giants lyk arsalan etc. The ambience is quite soothing. 
Another great thing about them is that they make some hell of a great mocktails.

I had always wanted to visit this place but never had such an opportunity but today i got a chance to visit this vintage place with my friends.We reached at around 2:30 and there was as usual a queue outside but fortunately we got a table within 5 minutes.On entering the first thing that impressed me was the vintage decoration with the low orange bulbs.We ordered the legendary chelo kabab,chicken marakesh and house special steak sizzler and sweet lime soda.The food arrived with 15 minutes and we plunged into the sinful plates of food.The chelo kebab stood up to its reputation,the steamed rice with butter and the runny egg poach was yummy.The kebab pieces were also yummy and delicious.But i felt the chicken kebabs in chicken marakesh was better.In the sizzler i had some sausage and it was lip smacking.Overall peter cat lives up to its reputation of legendary kebabs.Had an awesome time there and would be visiting soon.

Well I'm not writing this review for Calcuttans. They already swear by this place. This review is for visiting tourists & people  on business tour. There are high chances that you will have to wait on weekends. But once you step inside, you'll be taken back in time. It's a different world inside. Almost nothing has changed inside except for the numbers on the right hand side of the menu!!! The famed dish is of course " Chello Kabab" followed by Sizzlers. It's difficult to find a Calcuttan who has not tasted a Chello Kabab.

The dimly lit orange lights and pathan style waiter dress with delicious food, thats Peter Cat for you. Located at the prime location of Park Street, this place is a must visit.
Food: This place is known for Chelo Kebabs and is highly recommended.
Food: This place is known for Chelo Kebabs and is highly recommended.
Sizzlers are damn good, Sizzling Dum-Ki-Rann tastes heavenly.
Try Afgani Chicken, Chilly Fish, Dum-Ki-Rann with your drinks!
For Desserts do try Chocolate Nut Sundae or Meringue.
Few items in the food menu are mentioned as "Passionately Recommended" , Please ask the waiter about them. I had personally tried one of them and it was heavenly!

Peter Cat - One of the legendary food joint of Kolkata located at a prime location, yes it's true you need to wait for the ample of time for a table here on the weekends but once you are in you'll feel like wait at the queue was worth it..¬†
It's Charming interiors, the dim lights and the ambiance has reached this place to another level..¬†
Perhaps the first thing that comes in any foodie's mind in Kolkata once they hear about "The Chello Kebabs".."Kebabomaniacs" .... Will find this place heavenly..¬†
Probably they serves the best Chello Kebabs in Kolkata.. But that doesn't not mean one should overlook the sizzlers they serve.. Nope! Not at all..¬†
The food served is more than adequate and can easily feed two hungry soul at least.. The service is prompt and servers are courteous..¬†
There were people sitting behind the people who were sitting beside of some more people and who were sitting opposite more n more people. In between this riotous colourful congregation were the servers, dressed in white with a top knot on their head (pagri) weaving their way through the maze of tables to reach their destination..so if you haven't been to Peter Cat then you are not from the Kolkata... Be kolkatans..

Ever since i've been to Kolkata, i always use to hear about Peter Cat and its famous Chello Kabab but it was'nt that tastier and delicious as I expected, the chicken kabab was soft and the mutton seekh was also well cooked but no different or unique taste... prawn cocktail was something new and one of its kind. The peter cat cocktail was disgusting and the service and behavior was rude... the mocha soufle was the only thing which i liked. The restaurant is more of a hype and we can get better kababs in any cheap restaurant. The most irritating thing over there was lack of phone signal !!!!

Its funny how theres always a queue outside this place, but surprisingly, the wait is always worth it, always!!
Chelo kababs are an all time favourite...the sizzlers are gud too...and love the tandoori and also the mocktails...even the desserts are not bad but a little work can be done on them!!
The staff dress code..is pretty cool and also the service is fast and friendly!!

The place is located at the heart of Kolkata. On an average day you have to wait for 20 to 30 minutes to get a table here in the evening. The place is well known for its heritage value. Ambiance is good. Food is also good. Chelo Kebab is a must have. Apart from that I loved Chicken steak Sizzler. Continental foods are better compared to north Indian delicacies. I feel the place is bit overrated. Overall good to visit once or twice.

Chelo kebab is highly overrated! Sheekh kebabs were not juicy , they were dry! But the grilled fish sizzler and mixed tandoori sizzler were really tasty. People do try these both items. If you are meat lover and love north indian too then tandoori sizzler will be the right choice.

Chelo Kebab, thats what everyone knows Peter Cat by.

Coming to the place, you should consider yourself super lucky if you get a place to sit without waiting for hours, thats how the craze is. The restaurant is conveniently located and the ambience is decent.

About the food, it is known for the Chelo Kebab, but thats not the only thing good here. The sizzlers are excellent and so are the prawn cocktails.

Love this place, Peter Cat holds a special place in my heart.

There is only one reason that I go to Peter Cat .. Yes.. Chelo kebab. I've never had anything else in that place except desert off course. So the chelo kebab is not a single kebab but a dish with minced mutton kebab, boneless chicken kebab, fried egg, two cubes of butter and some white rice ! It is simply the most amazing meal - everything is perfect about it. 
I sometimes wish that the Park street restaurants would wake up from their 30 years slumber and get some new decor, new cuisines and new restaurants to bring life to the street. Till that happens my friends who love places frozen in time continue to enjoy!

Amazing place. Amazing food. I like the ambience here. We went there on a weekend. Queued up for our turn and finally managed to get a table after waiting for 45 minutes.
We ordered the dish that this place is famous for... The chelo kabab. We ordered a veg and a non veg chelo kabab. The food was delicious. Its a must visit at least for the kabab platter.

Spoiler alert  -

This place is not for drinks.
Please arrive here an hour before the time you wish to eat here.

Rightfully can be called The Heritage Restaurant of Kolkata. Been there numerous times. Just can't get enough of the delicious "Chelo Kebab" and "Chicken Marakesh". Food is very cheap and really good. So is the ambience. You get that feeling "Yes I am in Kolkata". Apart from that I would suggest anyone the Chicken Steak Sizzler. Must check it out. Well I think it's more than I have said. Rest you need to check out. Anyone who is new in Kolkata and of course to all Kolkatans!!!

After a long time of listening to people talk about this place i got a chance to eat at this restaurant. I called the restaurant in the afternoon to make a booking and was told that its first come first serve. When i went in the evening there was a few ppl wating already which I expected. After a while we gt seated . The place is really cramped . I ordered the Chello Kebab and the paneer makhanwala both wer just ordinary i have eaten better in dhabhas around ballygunge . Really disappointed with the overall experience.

I have been a great fan of chello kebab at Peter cat for ages since my childhood days. But when recently on my visit to kolkata i stepped into this restaurant , I must say that it was something of a shambles to me. This restaurant is still continuing with those same interiors as they had originally started with. The same lightings, same chairs and tables and same waiters , some of whom are so aged that they have well crossed the Government retirement age. These waiters neither do understand proper english nor can they speak. The carpets n staircase would make u feel like u r in a heritage structure which would fall down anyday and u could even celebrate the Halloween here. They have simply failed to change with time and sadly would be left behind soon. The tables are laid so close by that forget a personal meeting, u cant even discuss the menu amongst urselves without the person sitting at the next table overhearing you. And if there is a group of people speaking at their normal tone at the table beside you then it would seem like they are shouting and u are bound to be annoyed with that sound. The lights are very pathetic. The chello kebab has lost its sheen. If u order them the chello kebab straight away without any starters or drinks, the waiter would look at you as if he is doing some favour to you by serving you. And when the chello kebab arrives then its simply pathetic-looks like boiled rice with a spoon of butter on top and few pieces of kebabs dropped on the side. 
I dont understand why people still queue outside and wait for hours to get a table in this pathetic place. 
I guess the management has aged and havent seen what the world is upto now. Its time they woke up and buckle up their shoes else soon it will turn into a haunted house.

One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata which has managed to keep its place still high on its popularity quotients... 
Been there several times since childhood.. and I totally love their Indian dishes. Specially the mouthwatering kebabs.. 
Recently, tried out their signature dishes- the famous chelo kebabs and the mixed grilled sizzler. Chelo kebab( a platter of chicken kebabs, seekh kebab, paneer kebab, buttered rice and a poach) tastes as amazing as it looks.. a treat for both your mouth n eyes! ! And the mixed grilled sizzler, as expected, tasted mindblowing too.. we ordered a cream of sweetcorn soup in the beginning..it was thick and had very little taste.. didn't like it much. We also had pineapple blossom mocktail along with the our main courses which had a wonderful soothing taste and complemented well with our dishes.
The only problem is that you have to wait in queues almost whenever you visit this place.. but the waiters are very courteous and take every little possible care of you to give a highly satisfying dining experience!

Peter Cat has been around for decades & that speaks a lot ‚Äì Restaurants open very often & close down almost as often. The ones who survive the test of time surely have something nice to offer.

The d√©cor is retro in today‚Äôs context ‚Äì red sofas facing each other & nice lamp shades above each table. The lighting is dim overall but the lamps on each table illuminate the table good enough to see each other, have a good chat & enjoy some good food. There are two floors. We were shown the lower one as the floor above is mostly crowded and takes ages to manage a seat.

Waiting staff looks "purani",¬†with their sherwani suits, flamboyant headgear & pointed shoes. Most of them are however quite 'Old School' ‚Äì smooth talking, not-so-knowledgeable, not overtly attentive but attentive as well, not quite warm, talks with an air of authority interspersed with some rare smiles & I guess quite bored of doing the same job for donkey‚Äôs years which clearly shows in their faces.The food is good in general & at the prices that the food is offered, I would say thwy could been better.

To start, we oredered their house speciality - 2 Chelow Kebabs platter. Peter Cat‚Äôs Chelo Kabab has mid-grained steamed rice in the base but has two dollops of Amul Butter that make the rice sinfully good. However, it is unable to match the original version by a wide gap. The ‚ÄòOriginal Chelo Kabab‚Äô of Peter Cat has one set of chicken kababs & two mutton seekh kababs. There is also a mutton Chelo kabab in which all kababs r mutton. The server suggested that we go for the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô. The chicken kababs that came with the Chelo Kabab were good but usual. They were not juicy, not melt in the mouth but very tasty & flavorful. The mutton kababs were bad at texture as well ‚Äì brittle, not soft, not juicy, not chewy either and it felt bland in the mouth. Another house speciality is their choice of souffle's. We ordered Mocha Souffle' (Mochachino favoured). It was sinful. We enjoyed the dessert far more than the actual meal. We washed down our meal with fresh lime soda Sweet & salt that failed to make a statement. It was not bad though.¬†

I guess Peter Cat has a bright long future simply for the price-value equation that they have mastered over time. For culinary freaks & hardcore foodies with an exposure to the ‚Äòreal thing‚Äô, Peter Cat might not appeal as much.

One of the most authentic sizzler restaurant in the town. Famous for its chelo kebabs is a must try. Everything is great about this restaurant expect one thing which is you need to wait a lot to get in the restaurant for the long queue which would be there no matter which day of the week you go.

A trip to Kolkata is not complete without  a visit to Peter Cat...  just off Park Street, with a lot of character 
Primarily a sizzler joint , the most famous dish being the mutton Chelo Kabab. On a bed of the most fragrant rice pallao, a mutton Tikka shashlik and 2 pieces of mutton Seekh along with a fried egg with dollops of butter... just order it blindly
Also tried the Mutton burger sizzler , served with home made potato chips  drizzled generously with a freshly made barbecue  brown gravy sauce.
Food                                   8/10
Ambiance                           8/10
Service                               8.5/10

We tried the souffl√© of the day... Mocha ... nice but not spectacular.... expected it to be  
The dessert dragged the score down to a 4/5.

Highly recommended 
Value for money

The huge footfall for the famous chelo kabab out here is clearly not understood by me. I found it overrated and not worth the hype. However, the ambience with some gloomy yet appealing light arrangements and the staffs with antediluvian outfits which are reminiscent of the pre-independence coffee house era will make you feel marvelous . Also the sizzlers, especially the house special sizzler will make your visit a indelible one!

peter cat should change their name to chelo kebab for which the huge footfall is all about. highly overrated and crowded place. serves very okayish dishes compared to the price. would suggest people to visit mocambo instead of peter cat. virgin mary at peter cat is a disaster.

One of the best place to hang out with specially when ur sizzlers craving is high. Ambience was good though the service was a bit slow since it was panchami and the rush was huge. Coming to the food we ordered chicken steak sizzlers, fish sizzlers, roast chicken sizzlers and  chello kebab along with Heineken pint. Each and every food was tasty...I personally loved their fish sizzlers. Prices are reasonable.

Visited twice. The place always remains crowded at night. The ambience is great but a bit of clumsy. Coming to food, chelo kabab is the signature of peter cat. You must try it. And another item that I would definitely mention is chicken steak sizzler. And some of the starters are great too. Have tried a no of starters. Can't recall all of them. Fish Makhmali Kabab is really worth of trying. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Visited Peter Cat today for its famous Chelo Kabab but really didn't understand why this dish is so popular. According to its taste the rate is too much. I ordered Chelo Kabab and Fish Makhmali. Fish Makhmali was good but I expected better @325 / dish of 5pcs Kabab. Unfortunately today was dry day so that could not enjoy hard drinks. And above all space is too conjested and I was sweating inside the Restaurant as the AC was not sufficiently cooling. Overall my experience was not so good. This is my 1st and last visit at Peter Cat.

Extremely poor service in terms of management. They ask people to register their names and specify a waiting time of about 45min to 1hr. But even after that it is found they let people who registers later or at times they lie to people saying that they have called the names.

On one side it is true that they deliver good foods but on the other side their management is extremely poor and to add to it they lie to common people.

We went to this place during pujo because it was so well recommended!
We ordered chicken steak, vegetable steak, chello kebab, house special, shahi korma and tutti-fruity and hot sizzler brownie as desserts!
Vegetable steak  was bland (more like sweet) and we were told it's supposed to be like that! 
Even the chicken sizzler had a very strong sweet taste!
The only saving grace was the shahi korma. Though way too buttery for our tastes, it had a distinct flavour!
The brownie tasted stale and when we told the waiter, we were informed that it's their speciality and just CANNOT be stale!!
Also when we asked for a doggy bag, we were charged for the box and aluminium foil!! I have never seen this before!
Lastly, all this happened after a long wait... We had waited for 2 hours to get inside!

Peter Cat is a very popular restaurant in Park street area, popular for it's Chelo Kebab.I tasted Chelo Kebab, Many types of Sizzlers. Drinks are also available in affordable rates.I will suggest Chelo Kebar,a must try items here.P.S. For hard drinks, carry your Age proof with you (if you don't look like you are 21+).This happened to me, so better to do so. It was really embarrassing.

Been here during the festivities of the Durga Puja, the queue was normal and waiting time was around 15 mins.
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken sizzler and biriyani al nawab or simply put, the mutton biriyani.
Sizzler was really good. Hot and the taste was just yummy. Biriyani was somewhat not like what it was supposed to be. I felt it was not upto the mark.
Ambience, was dark lit, enjoyable.
Services were good.
Pricing was affordable enough. 

I visited with my partner and it was worth while. Recommended.

The ambiance is good.. Dim lights and seating arrangements are good. The waiters are well behaved and nice...

Now coming to the food 
We order legendary chello kabab mutton badami and plain pulao..
And each item has its own story..
Everything was balanced..
And sufficient
Then we ordered lime soda and mixed fruit sundea...
And that was the best.. I recommand everyone to try the mixed fruit sundae
Really yumm... And overall an amazing experience...

Peter Cat is probably the only alternative to Mocambo. These 2 names go hand-in-hand when it comes to defining the Park Street food experience. Iconic like Mocambo, Peter Cat offers a similar dining experience, but unique in their own way.

The food is terrific. Anything that applies to Mocambo, applies to Peter Cat as well. The stand-out preparation is the Chelo Kebab. Some may argue that the House special sizzler offers competition. Truth be told, they're all just delicious, no two ways to put it. ¬†
The ambience is wonderful, the d√©cor tends to stir up an appetite. There isn't much to say about Peter Cat apart from that it makes for a wonderful meal and never ceases to amaze, no matter how many times you eat here.¬†

Update (16/05/16): Service, in terms of pace and efficiency, has dwindled. Food is still good and Peter Cat still remains a classic. But I fear they're struggling to keep up with Mocambo.

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made.

Oh the perfect place for pujo lunch!! Totally worth the wait for an hour! This time got a table upstairs in spite of there being only two of us. Service is very, very prompt, staff are efficient and polite. The ambience... Simply superb. Dimly lit by hanging shades, it makes for a soothing effect and thus a very comfortable dining experience. The house special sizzler is what I love and therefore ordered, along with a Chinese Itch, which is basically a screwdriver with pineapple juice instead of orange. Once again, fell in love with the iconic Peter Cat, THE place for authentic Anglo-Calcuttan cuisine. Already can't wait for my next visit.

This was my first visit to this place and I was thrilled as it has been mentioned and recommended by several friends. I ordered their signature chello kebab...but I was utterly dissapointed by the quality of the food. The rice was ice cold and it failed to melt the butter. But there is no doubt that the kebab was really good. I am not sure if the rice is supposed to be cold or not, but for me the kebab was really good. The ambience gives you an old school feel and it really was good in regards to the age of the food joint.

What to say about this place! Few heritage restros in Kolkata like this can still boast about their best quality ambience and food to people who come to visit over here from other states/countries. Not writing anything about the signature dish Chelo Kabab which is legendary in this place, if you come to Kolkata, apart from Rosogolla and Mishti Doi, you should have Chelo Kabab from this place for tasting the deadly concoction of mutton, chicken and buttery rice. I want to take the names of some less-mentioned dishes for those people who are already done with the dishes of fame. Mutton Pishori Kabab is one of them. Even being a red-meat-hater, I loved that, so you can imagine its awesomeness! Afghani Chicken is great in taste if you like less-smoky but fried flavour of chicken, then you can order this dish instead of sizzlers. Among the sizzlers, the servers will always recommend for ordering mixed grill tandoor which contains chicken liver too. If you do not like livers, then order for chicken steak sizzler since it does not contain liver. Among fish preps, fried bekti with tartar sauce ticks my palate more than the munier which is more recommended by others. You can order for munier if you can take the fish without getting it fried. Apart from food, mixed cocktail served by them is good, we - the schoolmates made so many reunions in this place, and all were filled with good memories because of this place!

Old and vintage is what comes to mind thinking of Peter Cat. Dimly lit tables, old school service, generous portions and signature dishes. We tried a mutton bura kebab, the obvious chelo kebab, and a harems joy curry. All were distinctly good. The service was slightly slow but it's the food and the time-capsule that the place is that will bring you back there each time. At least that's what has worked for me each time.

I personally did not like the ambience of Peter cat, it's too dark and shady. One cannot even see the person sitting next to them. 
Talking about the food and about the oh so famous chelo kababs for which they are famous for and knew from my cousin sister about this place, so yes I did not like the chelo kababs at all, it was plain and bland with no taste at all, kababs were dry and poached egg was not gooey enough, rice and butter tasted okay and the grilled tomatoes. Service is okay . It can be better!!! Only loudness but no substance! I don't understand the hype around the chelo kababs ...Whyyyyy???!!!!

You know how much have to wait. Went with couple of my friends.. Though they said quality has decreased over the time but I had a good experience. Started with Kalyani black lebel!! Then chelo kebab and chicken steak.. Fish and baby corn.. Chilly babycorn & fish was yummyyy.. I didnt have chelo kebab as I had before. But I must say I didnt like the way they served the steak.. Didnt like that cornflower coating, even liver was bad in taste. But over all no need to say.. A good place to dine out any day.

Was there last night after almost 3 years. The legendary Chelo kebabs were ordered and whilst my New Yorker brother-in-law loved it (it's easily a 100 dollar plate on Wall Street, is what he said) I thought the kebabs have actually lost the succulent juicy yet crispy appeal of the old days. But always, always a favorite !! And the enthusiastic service (even though they're tip crazy) is stuff of legends. Wish they have a table reservation system now but oh well, I'm told the restaurant is now managed by a young blood, so change is to come. Keep the Chelo kebab of the old ! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç

The sizzling sizzlers and karismatic kebabs are their trademark...
Chelo Kebab
Chicken steak
Grilled fish
On many more...
In one word just yummy...
The best part is their service and the people managing the restaurant .. great gesture..well dressed too... Really impressive..

My recent visit to this place again made a mark in mind why they are still one the best I town..awesome guys :) it is really hard to maintain the standard set ..

If you wanna be sizzled with heavenly foods peter cat is there with its awesomely cooked sizzler and chelo kebab. They are best in the business. The grand hospitality of the waiters makes the inner ambiance a unique one, which one must feel. A must recommended place for family get together on a Saturday night. Its at the heart of Kolkata.

Went last day.. inner decoration was too good but the food quality is too awsome.. chelo kabab was top class.. tandoori rooti was good with chiken butter masala.. environment was good. And last but not the least behavior of the staff was too gentle.

Have to cut down an extra 0.5 for the waiting period of 1 hour we found (some 15 minutes extra for a guys-only group which is weird for a dine in restaurant).
I tried the much popular dish of the place, Chelo Kebab. I tried the vegetarian one. Chelo kebab is simply delicious. It maynot be a healthy dish completely but it is a perfect getaway for those of your 'cheat day'. It's wholesome too. And mind you, it becomes difficult to eat one entire meal, forget about ordering something else as supporting dish.

The service and hospitality of the restaurant is also good and the food comes well within reasonable time.

I am definitely going back again, ofcourse on my next cheat day ;)

If you are looking for Iranian dish in Kolkata then what other place is better than our very popular Peter Cat which is famous for their Chelo Kabab, the national dish of Iran. Almost everyone order Chelo Kabab when you are at Peter Cat. We are no exception so the dish is as expected delicious and heavy. The atmosphere is great as well as the food. Now let's come to the issues I have faced. Peter Cat is probably the first choice for most of the people at Park Street therefore the place is always packed up so you gotta wait in the queue for some minutes.And the second issue is the place lacks free space. The place is just a cluster of tables,chairs and people. Having said that Peter Cat really is one of the best attraction for a foodie. :-)

Quality food is available. Although the numero uno speciality of their's -Chelo Kabaab seemed to be a bit overhyped to me. Comparitively, sizzlers and kabaab platters are good here.

What can i say about peter cat.... It has always been one of the best restaurants in kolkata..i went there with my family and we were welcomed very cordially and were alloted a table as soon as we reached... But one must be ready to wait in a huge queue as they are housefull almost all the time and dont accept any prebooking.. We ordered the original chalo kebab and the mutton chalo kebab.. Both the dishes were made with the utmost precision and the serving time was also quick... But the only problem is that the place is full all the time and there is a lot of noise and chatter from the tables around so dont expect to share a moment of privacy with your significant other... Go to this place to enjoy the food with your company... But dont expect enjoy your company with the food.... 
Consider yourself lucky if you get a table on reaching and thank your lucky stars if the place is not completely full...but anyway you do it... The food is always going to be exquisite....

Who doesn't know about the famed Peter Cat at Park Street. I find it wonderful. It is truly up my street. I have been here for a couple of times. It's funny albeit not astonishing that I have actually gorged myself on its quintessential Chelo Kebab dish for nine out of ten times. It is unique one with a variety of items like rice, eggs, steaks, grilled paneer, grilled mutton, Persian herbs and vegetables and butter in spades. I am still in awe of this mouth-watering plate! Anyway moving ahead, the Biriyanis are fabulously executed here and you shall be spoilt for choice. Now they have some really heart-warming Sizzlers like the Tandoori Mixed Grill, House Special, Chicken Steak and the likes of these which are too good. Sizzler lovers must not procrastinate visiting the place. Finally the drinks. I am not so hot on drinks, speaking plainly. Yet I was insisted upon to try a sip or two of the El Borracho ( whisky sour) and wound up downing the entire glass! It was much to my chagrin, so damn tasty! Hence I would like to encourage everyone to explore all the splendid possibilities there to have your fill of some incredible and interesting amalgamation of the Persian and Indian cuisines.

One of the most popular and the most famous restro of Kolkata. We were welcomed very warmly at the gate and were allotted a table directly as we reached there just at 7 pm. But please be ready to spend considerable time in queue if you are even just half an hour late as they are always full and no advance table booking is accepted. Well, could not order anything other than the famous chelo kebab and it was really yummy. Portion was just adequate but tastes heavenly. The desserts were very good. Caramel custard was nice and the brownie with ice cream and hot choco sauce was just excellent. Service is really quick. However, when we ordered for the drinks which was supposed to be served on the rocks, it was just served normal with ice being served separately, that too the ice was small broken pieces which was melting so fast that could not enjoy the drink to the fullest. Otherwise, everything was lovely.

One of the most iconic restaurants on parkstreet. Most of the time you will have to wait for atleast 10-15mins during a peak time to get a seat. 

But once you are in the ambience will attract you. Dim lighting makes it a very soothing ambience. I have mostly tried the famous Chelo Kabab and the Mix grill sizzler. Chelo Kabab is a meal in itself. Varieties of Kababs served with a portion of rice,a fried egg and a good dollop of butter. Just heavenly. The Mix grill sizzler too is a great mix of all the non veg Kababs and topped with a Indian gravy. Served with dinner rolls. Awesome taste and very filling. And very economical too in today's times.

Every time I crossed peter cat I would see people waiting outside for a table.. Most of the times its all occupied.. So I would go to KFC right across the street and watch people wait outside patiently.. I would imagine if it was worth it.. And then I had d opportunity to dine in this place with a good friend..though I knew about its legendary chello kebab I still ordered something different to check if it was just good in one thing.. But when the order arrived it was an Indian sizzler.. An assortment of mutton sheekh kebab, chicken and prawn kebab... And just the sight of it got me hungry.. Every bite of the savoury meat gave me the idea if why people would wait for der turn to dine here even with so many options around.. Cause I would do the same if I crave for those sizzling kebabs again.. Am sure there are only a few people who haven't been there already.. But if you havent.. You are late.. Like I was.. But its never too late.. Do visit.

Chelo kabab it is. I think 90% of the people who go there they all have some or the other valiant of chelo kabab. This is its legacy. And whenever you tell someone that you have been to Kolkata and had good food, there will be one common question: "have you been to Peter cat?"

Finally visited this legendary place after ages!! One of the best places to dine in at parkstreet!!
Ambience is classy nd posch.. quite spacious..dimly lit with nice red hanging lamps on each table.. also a bowl of pickeled onions, achaar( mixed pickle) along with chillies and lemon were kept at each table which is quite appreciated..
Service was good nd the waiter was quite attentive..
Evn at 5.45 pm on a sunday..we found quite a rush and as time passed..more people started to drop in showing how popular this eatery is.
Coming to the food..we ordered the trademark chello kabab..it ws really good..the rice,butter dollops,chicken kababs wid grilled veggies and poached egg along wid the "chello kabab" ( succulent moist minced meat) made up a fine meal..
Next came grilled chicken sizzler.. the brown sauce ws really tasty and it complemented the grilled chicken pieces..was served with grilled potatoes blended with spices nd sm sautted veggies.the pieces of chicken cud hv had lesser bones and more meat..however the taste made up for it.
Next ordered the betcky munier.. nw dis was another standout dish..two good pieces of bhetki fillets grilled (moist and tender) nd served in a really delicious white creamy sauce..accomponied by some roasted potatoes( same as served in the grilled chicken platter).
A pure gastronomical delight with lip smacking food at decent prices..
It costs us 1098 exact inclusive of all d taxes..
Chello kabab- Rs 334
Betcky munier- Rs 325
Grilled chicken sizzler- Rs 255.
A must visit!

lf you love to eat at Park Street and never have waited in the queue outside the Peter Cat then you have much to explore in Park Street....This is one of the finest and busiest restaurants in there with much surprise. According to me it can claim the second best position in the terms of ambience (sorry guys ,first is obviously Mocambo)..
Anyone , who have not tried the Chelo kebab there, should at least once give it a try.It is a perfect blend of taste and aroma. I personally have tried most of their non veg items and this review will be too long if I describe them all. Apart from Chelo Kebab (their signature dish) try their Chicken Marakesh, Brain Masala, any of their kebabs and any of their rice.I cant say anything about alcohol as I am a dry person.
ambience 8/10
food 9/10
behavior of the staffs 8/10

I was planning to write an review on peter cat or to be precise their chelo kabab for a long time but somehow it was left out. At last I thought of giving it a go with my re cent endeavours, well than here it goes:
I always felt cramped out sitting there in my grads and after my masters and job i still feel the same.
We ordered fish makhmali in starters and it was mouth watering.
As always the person i went with ordered mutton chelo kabab. Taste wise it has been kept intact although my partner had a different view on it. For me only a small pointer is that i felt the capsicum in the platter was undercooked.
I had masala kulcha and chicken reshmi butter masala both of them were good and hearty in terms of portion.
Overall its a great place for a family get together but though the staffs are very polite and quite frankly i admire that most, still I have to say they are not capable of handling non indian clients and that hampers the reputation of this place.
P.S could not upload any pic as I went for a rushed lunch.üòÉüòÉ

I ended up going to this place as per my friend's suggestion on my first trip to Kolkata. God this place is one of its kind! My personal note for first timers, try the Zomato's recommended list especially Cheolo kebab and Buckty Munier. The entire package of butter rice, chicken and mutton kebab makes it up to its reputation! On a side note, don't expect much of cocktails!

Absolute Value for Money!

P.S.: Either make a reservation or be there before 30 mins ahead your plan. Place is pretty crowded!

The restaurant is situated at park Street Kolkata.. The entire street is full of many restaurant and eating joints..
I visited on recommendation of one of my friend and I was not at all disappoint .

The ambience of the restaurant is amazing . the sitting place is divided into ground and first floor.

You have to wait for minimum of 15-30 minutes on weekdays to get the seat and on weekends evening it could be more.

The staff is very warming and will not pester you with their presence.

I ordered vegetable steak . This was one of their signature dish and it was mouthful choice. It's enough for single person.

It's little on the costlier side but that compromises with presentation and taste of food. 

I highly recommend this restaurant if you really want to cherish the food.

Chelo kabab and sizzlers if ur dream about these then probably Peter Cat is calling you. In Bengalis there is a saying if God doesn't call you u can't visit them how much you try. So if ur dream of the above then it's a sign that Peter is calling you.
The must try is the all time favorite Chelo Kabab and in this happy moment it calls for a Carlsberg.

As always Peter Cat is a destination for all foodies if they want a guranteed quality and a old calcutta ambience. The kebabs are as usual fantastic. The long waits outside during weekends are equal fun too. It always gives me a great ethusiasm to come back from time to time to enjoy the same super good menu year on year. Lets hope they keep on running the show for decades to come.

On a winter afternoon of 2014, three of us friends, landed in Peter Cat in search of Chelo Kabab, the signature cuisine of this place.

The ambience is awesome. Lighting with shadow, with the theme of dressing code of the people serving, gives you a royal feeling.

And then came the food. The Chelo Kabab.

To sum it up in one word, it was amazing. The rice, the butter on it, the egg to top the mood... And you have two kinda of kababs to accompany. It was too good. We tried a chicken sizzler also but it was the former which stood out.

A must try place.

For the first time went to the Infamous Peter Cat for Lunch. Had to wait for more than 30 mins after registering as there were many people waiting outside. My eagerness to go inside was increasing, after a while my name was called and I got the opportunity to enter the restaurant, ambiance would not be able to rate much on that. Ordered the speciality Chelo Kababs of Peter Cat along with some Sweetlime Soda. The Chelo Kababs came with rice butter and seek Kababs. The taste was absolutely awesome. Then ordered for House Special and Grilled Steak both were good too.

The service was a bit disappointing however it's a good place to have a lunch or dinner.

Everybody who lives in Kolkata knows this place. Without exception. PC has a great brand name, and its not without reason. One of the best continental food places in the city. Sizzlers, started over a decade ago (possibly first in the city) continue to charm till this day (Chelo Kabab, please). The prawn cocktail is simply heavenly. Ambience is great, on the quieter side but in a good way. Prices are slighlty upscale but the quality of food is really worth it. Fair warning - its best to book a table if you are visiting on a weekend evening otherwise you might end up waiting an hour on the street, which obviously tends to spoil the experience.

Love the feel of this place. The pretty low hung lamps in the otherwise dim lighting adds to the charm. Added to it, is the way the waiters are dressed, with their fancy turbans. On this visit, ordered the Beckty Meunier and the famous Chelo Kebab. The Meunier, which had fish fillets in white hollandaise sauce, with baked potatoes and freshly chopped veggies on the side, was really good. And Chelo Kebab, need I describe it? It was pure decadence, and one can see why this deserves to be the signature dish here. All in all, this was quite a filling meal for two. But I would like to mention that last time, I had tried the Fried Chicken Liver after reading reviews on Zomato, and I am sorry to say that the dish had disappointed me. So there's still room for improvement in this otherwise highly recommended place.

Went to peter cat after hearing about their chello kabab ...obviously :) ..ambience was spectacular.... We had the chelo kabab and a grilled chicken sizzler... Liked the chicken, rice and vegetables of the chelo kabab palate, but didn't like the chelo ironically :/ ... Sizzler was good too...but honestly, the place is overpriced  and there is a false hype about the place...I had set high hopes,but was a little disappointed.

What can you write about an institution in the food circuit of the city. It has been a haunt for many a Kolkatan and even outsiders for a long time. It has been one of our favorite spots for Sizzlers and the iconic Chelo Kabab since childhood.

The numerous visits have not dented the appetite to come back for more of the same to this place.

The fish finger is one the best served in the Park Street area. Apart from that you have a good selection of kababs and some continental choices.

The only issue is getting a table on most days for both lunch and dinner and especially during weekends the waiting time can easily be more than an hour. This has never deterred 'fans' of Peter Cat and the queues don't get shorter.

The service is so-so but then the prices are very reasonable for such an outlet.

We hope it continues to excel in the food department and we keep going back for more.

Nothing much to say when it comes to Peter Cat. Thinking of the name itself makes me go hungry..! 
If you have not tried the Chelo Kabab yet, its high time. You will get it in other restaurants too,  but nothing beats Peter (atleast for me!). üëåüèΩ
Did you know-
Chelo kabab is a national dish of Iran.? üòÄ

This legendary outlet is still at its high during the weekends and holidays. Though last two times I visited the place I found that it has lost its old charm. Chelo Kabab was good but not great. I found the Sizzler better than the Chelo Kabab. Price is a bit on the higher side. However it will remain legendary for the ambiance, the service and the place.

Chelo Kabab was always my goto food at this restaurant but thought of trying something fishy this time..So ordered a Grilled Fish sizzler. It has 2 generous pieces of Bhetki fish in a creamy sauce and serverd with potatoes and boiled vegetables. You can try this if u r in a mood to have something light..

Just like old wine, a few established restaurants keep appreciating their value with each passing year! Peter Cat is one of those places for sure & needs absolutely no reviewing or introduction whatsoever.

I've read about it & seen it on a travel show on Kolkata, even before I could step in to the hallowed gates and when I finally got the chance, thanks to my dear friend

First time dinner with my whole family made awesome by Peter Cat. It's situated at the hub of the city, Park Street, and offers a lot of varieties in the menu. We ordered Dum-Ki-Raan, Chicken Steak, Chicken Biryani and the famous Chelo Kabab, It was delicious and the quantity was enough for us (5 persons). Will surely visit again soon!

Legendary outlet in the city of joy. Finally had a visit to this place with four of my friends on the day of vishwakarma puja. We had to wait there in the queue for about 10 minutes, before we entered this place and man the ambience was awesome.We were directed upstairs and the hospitality was also very nice.Now come the food part. We ordered an obvious Chelow kabab and a full Tandoori chicken. To my disappointment i was not satisfied with the legendary ¬†chelow kabab of peter cat. I had heard that the quality has fallen down since the last few years and i felt the same too :(The tandoori chicken was at par. But again to my disappointment a bill of ‚Çπ800 called for more from the prospective of quality as well as quantity. I never expected the quantity to amaze me but still it was sad. overall an average experience at the historic PETER CAT :)

We ordered CHICKEN STEAK SIZZLER, It had chicken, carrots, potatoes, beans and a poached egg. We were predetermined to have Iranian delicacy. I had CHICKEN MARAKESH and my friends ordered CHICKEN CHELO KEBAB. Both the dishes looks similar has almost similar items with a minor difference. Plain white rice, chunk of butter, salad, chicken reshmi kebab. The only difference being, marakesh has a chicken pasty whereas the chello has a poached egg an the food was mouth watering, delicious, too good to explain in words.

One of the legendry restaurant in park street famous for it chelo kabab. Went with my friend who came to see me in kolkata , so took her their but myself being vegetarian I was wondering what can I eat there. I was delighted to see a veg option for chelo kebab and it was delicious. Served with rice, salad, veg seekh kabab , tandoori paneer and last but best of all was stuffed potato. I would say a must try to vegetarians

Legendary restaurant in Kolkata is synonymous to 1hr waiting .Never mind on that it's a childhood favourite. We saved money to have Chelo kebab in school days. Food is good but they have taken the success in their stride. When u don't bother about customers the place offering best food becomes unwelcoming and u tend to think of options. Some great dig here are house special steak, Chelo kebab, chicken marakesh, tandoori mixed grill, grilled fish, reshmi  kebab, prawn cocktail. Food rating is 5/5 ,Service 3/5, Ambience 4/5. Try this heritage place if you have enough time to spare the food would cure the mood.

There's a place in Park Street arena, where the clock stopped running sometime around the 70's. They named it, "Peter Cat". Fine dine, dreamy light, royal atmosphere makes it a classy affair.

GREAT FOOD!!

It really deserves a spot in the Legendary Restaurants Collection. You should really avoid weekends if you are unwilling to stand in a queue. However this shouldn't lead you to believe that they have less seating area, it has two floors but that could still fall short for food crazy bongs.

I was leaving for Bangalore and my friend for Pune and thought Peter Cat would be the best place for three good friends to have lunch and have fun before we meet again. It has really nice interiors with hanging lamps, really comfortable seats, dim lights, it really sets the mood. Oh and another thing, they have a really quick service.

Obviously we didn't have any inclination for veg item otherwise we wouldn't have been there in the first place. We ordered CHICKEN STEAK SIZZLER, It had chicken, carrots, potatoes, beans and a poached egg. We were predetermined to have Iranian delicacy. I had CHICKEN MARAKESH and my friends ordered CHICKEN CHELO KEBAB. Both the dishes looks similar has almost similar items with a minor difference. Plain white rice, chunk of butter, salad, chicken reshmi kebab. The only difference being, marakesh has a chicken pasty whereas the chello has a poached egg an the food was mouth watering, delicious, too good to explain in words.

I have one grievance though, they serve whiskey in tall glasses, usual standards say they should use flat based, broad mouth, small glasses.

Peter cat the name itself a brand, one of the oldest restaurant in the city, it's charming interiors, dim lights and the ambiance has reached this place to another level. This place is known as The pioneer of Chelo kebabs, they serves incredible sizzlers too. If you go to weekend you'll have to wait to get your table, but after visiting the place you'll feel like wait at the queue was worth it.

Peter Cat, as nostalgic as it is, leaves a bad taste in your mouth with it's ill mannered staff and 'we care a damn' attitude. Coming to the food, it is just about alright. The starters comprising of fish fingers and mutton sheeks were really awesome though what followed was not. The chelo kabab (though widely worshipped) is basically some buttered rice with a fried egg and a side of mutton sheek kabab and chicken kabab. No doubt it is good but runs more on the hype than substance. The sizzler is just awful with soggy fries and a strange platter full of batter fried chicken fillets (again soggy from being dipped in gravy for too long). A gentle complain to the manager is met with a sharp "...but that is how sizzlers are supposed to be". Well gentleman it is time you walk out of your little hole and see what the world is offering both in terms of food and service. Don't travel too far for right next door in Park St. itself Mocambo and Bar-B-Q serve much better food (though the service is again another story). This review however has little or no consequence for Peter Cat for they do not care (as people still wait for hours to get a place to sit and seem to faint with exhilaration after touching their god like chelo kabab). I know it is blashphemous to criticize an institution like Peter Cat but I apologize to it's many years of establishment and it's fan club when I say - Please drop into peter cat for an evening of nostalgia and insults.

One of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata or rather Calcutta, considering Peter Cats heritage. 
We ordered the famous signature dish, Chelo  Kebab and wifey and mom went the veg way, with Veg Begum Bahar. 
The Chelo Kebab was good, not out of this world which I guess were my heightened expectations. The Veg Begum Bahar was pretty bland.
The biggest downer was the service - excruciatingly slow...We almost waited for 45 mins for the food to appear. And I guess it's pretty common there because the servers were pretty skilled in avoiding the tables and patrons who were waiting. Overall a disappointment considering the legendary status of Peter Cat.

When it comes to sizzlers and chello kebabs, Peter cat is definitely the place to be in. One of the oldest restaurants in Park Street, this place just keeps getting better and better and the price of liquor is also very reasonable. We had ordered chello kebabs and chicken sizzlers and both the dishes were just perfect! The ambience is really great over here but it's very difficult to get a table as this place is always crowded. Looking forward to my next visit! :-)

Landed in Cal, and had this on my to-do list for day 2....went on a Saturday afternoon, around 1'ish, got a place for one, right away....took the public's highly opinionated Chelo Kebab, with two mugs of beer.
Have to admit, as a Delhiite, I'm not impressed at all. The chicken kebabs were just plain rubbery, with herb seasoning slapped over them, while the mutton, although quite savoury, were nothing out of the ordinary. Any kebab house in old Dilli will offer way more ¬†in terms of the flavours. Never really understood the fuss though. Chelo Kebabs are Persian by design. There is absolutely nothing Persian about the platter at Peter Cat.
Have to give full points for the ambience, though. Do visit it for a well preserved Victorian feel, in a contemporary setting.

Just wished that it wouldn't be so noisy as we were seated next a group of people who where divided into 2groups and they were yelling in order to be audible across the other table.

Located just beside Music World (for those who still find it very hard to accept the presence of Au Bon Pain where Music World is used to be), Peter Cat is a legendary restaurant in Calcutta. If you are visiting Park Street area, you must make a point to visit it. The quality of the food may not be the same as it used to be a few years back but it is definitely worth visiting just to feel the awe as well as soak yourself into a bit of Old Kolkata. The ambience is still good and so is the sitting. Service has always been a positive point of this place and it hasn't changed either. The only thing that felt a bit different was the quality of food.

Our orders:

Fish makhmali kabab

mutton seekh kabab

fish finger

Chelo kabab

Except the mutton seekh kabab, the rest tasted very nice though I was not very impressed with the chelo kabab. I remember I used to frequent this place with my family or cousins a while back. The food used to be excellent and that's why we used to go there so often. Now the food tasted okay but not that great. Especially the chelo kabab. Perhaps it is one food item that has gained more fame than the restaurant serving it. A specialty of Peter Cat for ages, this chelo kabab is an assortment dish. It contains a bed of long grained rice with dollops of amul butter, a half-boiled omlette, 2 mutton seekh kababs and a set of chicken kababs well done and paired with roasted vegetables - 1 with each chicken kabab. This whole thing is legendary and people wait for hours to taste this. It is no doubt very exciting and delicious but during my recent visit to the city, I happened to revisit this place and did not really feel the same charm of chelo kabab as it used to be. The price has climbed up and the quantity has come down. If you can ignore this fact, all is well and delightful.

PS:

1. They serve alcohol but funny the collection of whisky isn't that great.

2. The dim lights will give you a cozy feeling.

3. No Smoking inside the restaurant.

4. They have 2 floors of sitting, can't say which one is better but I have seen people preferring the upper one.

5. Peter Cat seemed a bit overpriced to me considering the portions of food.

6. The rest room is upstairs, there isn't one in the ground floor.

A legendary restaurant indeed. When u look at it from outside u wonder how small it is but when u see the crowd trying to get a table u wonder how good it is. From the moment u walk past those doors u will b damn impressed by that decor. Decorated carpet with wooden finish wall. Table arrangement like the 70's. Clinking sounds of cutlery items and the chatter of people so beautiful u wud want to b a part of it. Serves equally great food. Go fr the cocktails. My fav is John Collins. The drinks menu is equally interesting. But u have to b 21 to drink. Chello kebab original is peoples fav. 8/10 people who come here have chello kebab. Sizzlers are good but not great. Don't try the mutton chello kebab, too dry. Don't forget to try the desserts. If u have never been to this place well u r in for a treat. (Y) (Y)

Well this is one of the classic places in Kolkata. If one is ready to stand in a queue, which you can see almost always outside this place, this is a must visit. 
Peter cat made chelo kebab a favourite of all restaurant hoppers. And till date it remains its most popular dish. Every time I have been to this place chelo kebab was a must in the orders. And yes, this is the best chelo kebab you can have in this city. Sizzlers and steaks are also very good.  The ambience gives you a feel of old days' city.
So if you haven't been to peter cat yet, make this your next destination and do have the chelo kebabs by all means.

When you talk about Peter Cat's food, you must start with the famous Chello Kebab! Delicious is an understatement! Then had makkhan nun nd chicken reshmi butter masala & chicken varta! They were equally great! Although the booze I found to be a tad expensive, the food & the ambiance made up for it in a big way! Be careful if you are going to order alcohol, keep your id card else they can create a fuss.

Food is mind-blowing. I can never get bored of the chelo kebabs here. And the servings are very generous. Last time I visited, only I could finish the whole serving amongst the 4 of us. Hence, as a suggestion, if you and your partner do not have a big appetite just order one chelo kebab. It should do for both of you.
You cannot afford to miss eating here, if in or around park street!

House Special Sizzler is one of the solo winner in the menu.
Chelo is good too.
You can try chicken alakiev ¬† or grilled fish for a change.

Overall, this place is too good and reasonable.The ambience is perfect for both formal and informal occasions.

Food is outstanding and if you are visiting Kolkata as a tourist then this place is a must visit restaurant in Park Street! Particularly for those who love continental food.

I think they should by now change the name to CHELO's - the very famous dish of the house & do I really need to say how it tastes?? C'mon every calcutta person knows this eatery & their chelo kebabs.
But you get other dishes as well..like I ordered (apart from chelo) cream of sweet corn soup, chicken irani, sizzler.
Sizzler I found was not upto the expectation though but soup n chicken was outstanding. Finally ended with Brownie &vanilla ice cream (yummilicious)!!!!
One thing I would like to add is that I never had biryani here so no comments & it is a little overpriced (yes it is)
Nevertheless whenever I would crave for chelo I have to go there & yes definitely within 7:30 p.m. (on wkend) coz am sure I would not get a table.

I hear lots of positive reviews about this place from my peers, friends and foodies. I like it but I won't say it amazed me. Quality of food and VFM is good, but somehow ambience is not pleasant for me(strictly for me). Also, they don't take table reservations, so long waiting queues are not my thing. Anyhow, chelo kabab is great. The best part I liked about it is the butter rice(*laughs*). Also, the cocktails are good. All in all, its a great place.

There is hardly anyone from Calcutta who havent heard of Peter Cat. This legendery restaurant in Park Street, has been there for ages, made people que up in front of its entrance for hours, but has always managed to live up to expectation. You go there, wait for a seat, and when you enter find everybody eating the same dish. Yes, you got it right, Chello kabab it is. The taste has remained the same all these years.. Their other two legendary specialities are chicken marrakesh and sizzlers.
If anyone has still missed out on there chello, you are difinitely missing on something majestic.

Peter cat is always crowded ! You'll always see a long waiting line whether you go for lunch or dinner ! If u dont know bout the place too much then u might think they are giving away food for free thats how the rush is !! 
As far as my experience went i had the chillo kebab (veg). It is a lot hyped than what it actually tastes ! I guess it is a good option for non vegetarians but for vegetarians i still feel bar b w is a better option

Pieter Cat never ceases to keep its diners hooked on to their age old fame of Chelo Kebabs and Sizzlers.
I tried the Grilled Fish Sizzler. The fish was cooked to perfect tenderness and the lettuce bathed with the Sizzler sauce is something that's close to my heart. 
All in all, good food that fills you up and leaves you satiated!

Was waiting desperately to give a visit to this place after hearing so many things about this place. Finally got a chance to go to Kolkata and bang same night I went to peter cat.
U need to do a booking before get into there. Got a seat and ordered the much hyped dish mutton chelo kebab, veg steak and Biriyani ala nawabi and chicken tandoori. This place is a gem of food preparation where u will get salsa of sizzlers, Mediterranean and mugal food and its will presented to you with huge delegacies.
Service was fast and food was beyond imagination and we were in no mood of sharing each others dish. Meat was soft juicy tender and nicely cooked, it just blown our mind. Thought as if a visit to this place paid off our trip of Kolkata. "Peter cat rocks". At the center of park street where there's no night this place is a must visit and holds a heritage of mix cuisine. Charges were not expensive and food was heavenly. Guys please mark this place as must visit on u r menu when u hunting in the streets of Kolkata.

This evening, me and my friend decided to dine at Peter Cat, Park st., one of the renowned restaurants in Kolkata.  After a painful wait of around 1hour, It was our turn to enter.
Better to say, the food didn't heal the pain of the waiting time. 
We started with fish makhmali which was really nice dish.
But the home sizzler & chelo kebab disappoint us . 
Ending words, Ambiance & staffing is better than some 4 stars of the city.
Considering everything I can't rate Petercat more than 3.5 out of 5.

One of the several iconic restaurants in Kolkata, Peter Cat is a must visit for all food lovers and meat lovers alike. The restaurant has upheld its 70s decor and traditional food and drinks menu. This place is so popular that a 30 minute wait for a table ¬†(considering it is a fairly large place) is considered standard. People start queuing up over an hour before service starts - such is the frenzy regardless of whether it is a weekday and weekend. Located at the one the "food streets" of the city filled with iconic restaurants, the crazy about Peter Cat shows how well the hotel has maintained its standards.¬†Food is mostly delicious with the classic Chelo Kabab being the crown on its jewels. One cannot go wrong with any non vegetarian item on this menu. The only downside of a visit being the time of service. The restaurant is under staffed and over crowded so service is slow and sometimes frustrating.¬†

A visit to Kolkata is incomplete without a visit to Park Street - and a visit to Park Street is incomplete without a meal at Peter Cat (albeit after waiting for over 30 minutes for a table).

A legendary food joint of Kolkata, Peter cat is located at a prime location. Yes it's true that you need to wait for a table here but once you are in everything will be worth doing. The place serves the best Chelo kebab in the town. The best part of the platter was the butter apart from the egg, mutton and chicken kebabs. we also tried Pea polao alonside Chicken butter masala. The taste of the butter masala was just great. Yeah you may find the menu to be slightly overpriced but the ambiance balance it. the waiters are great. It's the most talked restaurant in Kolkata once you are giving  treat either yo your family or your friends/colleagues. 

Would love to visit this place again and again.

I had heard about this place from almost everyone in kolkata. It is located on the main road of Park Street. Getting a table here seems like a challenge, but we managed to; without any reservation. The service is super slow; that's the only con. Food is super tempting. Must try fish finger, tandoori broccoli, and their famous chelo kebabs. Top it up with some chilled beer and that's it! Worth visit this place. Food: 9/10, service: 6/10

I had some Kolkata famous kabab with combination rice

It's an old famous local restaurant 

It's very famous for non veg kebab but even the vegetarian food was good 

But there is more staff than required ,so it's create a situation where no one is taking responsibility of the table they are serving

Chelow kabab.
Enough said.
That's the pros .
Cons are
Wait time of 30 mins to reserve the table
Add 40 mins more for the food to arrive
Amount of rice has diminished considerably from what I had seen in pics posted by previous zomato users.
So its a so so for me.

Looking for a romantic date, then this can be the place for u. Lamps over each table whereas everywhere else it is dark...kind of romantic...like modern day candle light dinner ( or lunch, that depends).
Food is good, price not too much. They really know hoe to make kebabs. One of the best kebabs in kolkata can be found here.
One one problem is that no matter when u visit this place....min amount of time u have to wait to get entry is 25-30 mins.

good chelo kebab.though d quantity of rice has reduced to almost half of what they used to serve earlier. That's their only USP.any other food is just ok.infact now a days u get better chelo kebabs in quite a few other places that r far far better than peter cat.
No matter when u go....u need to wait.iv been there quite a few times on unavoidable circumstances...and every time I feel that there's absolutely nothing worth mentioning about this eatery....apart from d word "heritage".
Along with food, u get to see some major attitude of d waiters and other staff.wel, in fact, this is very common among d Park street restaurants. 
What else ??

Nicely decorated place...perfect place to take ur wife out for a date... Well after hearing and reading reviews, we thought of having the chello kebab... The dish was really well garnished and seasoned with the flavours.  The rice and the chicken tasted great, but the mutton sausage which is also served with the dish is a bit dry.... The waiters were really great and well behaved... We also ordered ice creams... Vanilla with hot chocolate sauce... The chocolate sauce was given in a pot and we had to pour it as much we wanted it. The chocolate sauce was really great and it was really thick... The ice cream had a wayfer also. We enjoyed our dinner really well. Hoping to have a dinner once again very soon.

Peter Cat is the one place in Park Street where one can have GOOD FOOD at a reasonable price. The restaurant might not have a large area but it‚Äôs one of the best food joints that one would want to go to, especially in Park Street. The atmosphere and decoration sums it up to be classic. Peter Cat has a long heritage and one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. Also, it has that distinct patrician vibe.  Anyone who visits Peter Cat must have Chelo Kabab and Chicken House Sizzler. It‚Äôs the best in town. Chelo Kabab happens to be one of the signature dishes of Peter Cat.

During Christmas and New Year, it becomes really difficult to grab a seat. People get to stand in queue from almost 6:00 in the evening. However, having said that, the wait in the queue is definitely worthwhile.

One of the worst lunch experience at One of the oldest and most famous restaurant of Kolkata.Guys !! You need to Change a lot ..Be it the customer servicing ,Quality of Food or the basic Staff Courtesy ...
We tried tanduri chicken which was below average. I think the marination used here is almost similar to the one they use in Sizzlers !!!When we told them to replace ...there comes 2 arragont Staffs not ready to listen to anything other than there own stupidity. There are many ways to say no we can't offer you a replacement instead they were all gaga on the quality of Chicken,Tendor Juicy Chicken ...Best in town chicken and all . Comeon !! We wanted a straight answer from you ...whether can you change or not ??
We paid the money and left the place  ..
Last Piece of Suggestion to the Man who build the castle ..take your team out to some other restaurant to see how customer service is changing ...For Sure world is changing but customer shall remain same ...Customer is the KING !!!

Pathetic ¬†experience at Peter Cat,yesterday!. Firstly inspite of booking a table at 2pm, we were only called inside at 2:45. This was still okay;but the managers out there were not at all diligent and hospitable.(Especially one of them-He was so rude that he didinot felt like answering our query of how much more time will be required to get a table). Customers were called based on their frequency of visits at the restaurant and not on the basis of their time of arrival. However,more disgust was waiting for us inside. We went inside and placed the orders asap. But we were only served food after 1 hrs time. We simply lost interest in eating by that time. Actually what happened was the person who received our orders did not took the pain of passing down the same to the kitchen. We were told this by the waiter itself and he was couteous enough to apologize profusely.(The only courteous person we came across). We had chicken irani kebab/chelo kebab/grilled fish sizzlers with bread and fruit sundae's. Though the food was sumptuous and tasty, the breads which we were to have with the sizzlers arrived when we had almost finished off the dish. So happened with the desert as well.. Really unacceptable and degrading experience ¬†from a restaurant of such repute!!
Had gone there with high hopes. Will think twice now, before ¬†visiting this place again..

I don't think any calcutta foodie has skipped this restaurant similarly I have visited it many times but for my recent visit I thought I should write a review about this place. Saturday and Sunday is always crowded you can't do anything about it so as usual we had to wait for half an hour to get a table. There is nothing more to say about the ambience which everyone knows is very warm and nice with is accentuated with those red cosy chairs and dim lights. We quickly ordered 1 chello kebab,1 house special sizzler, 1 bekty munier and 3 fresh lime sodas. Personally I think that the chello kebab is good but not awesome and truelly speaking this is the only place till date which serves a decent chello kebab.  My friend enjoyed her sizzler which I think was yummy and perfect. In bekty munier the quality of the fish was topnotch and cooked really really well in a light creamy gravy(simply loved it) but alas the potato served with it was quite spicy and a complete contrast in taste than the fish which was a bit weird. Nevertheless we enjoyed our food but the most annoying thing are their staffs because I think they are really weird . The total amount came to rs. 1500 approx.

I believe every foodie must try the famous chelo kabab here atleast once. It is ravishing. There is no need to speak much about their chelo kabab and the mouth watering sizzlers available here because everyone knows how great they are. Chelo kabab fills your apetite. Perfectly cooked. The ambience and service is perfect. Reservation is recommended as this place is always crowded. The only negative point is that the vegetarian chelo kabab was not up to the mark.. It was just 'fine'. Nothing special. But overall experience was spendid.

Its not a restaurant, its a nostalgia for every Calcuttan. No point reviewing, I always feel like revisiting this 70s dim lit good old place. Order for your lager which comes with the complimentary 'chanachur' and the vinegar soaked button onions - Bliss! Then you get into the eternal dilemma of opting between Chello Kebab or Sizzlers! Whatever you chose, you'll be equally satisfied and full. Burrpppp.

If you are off to a vintage tour around the city of joy and you happen to brush over Parkstreet, do stop by for some delicious grub this place offers. The best of it being the mighty Chelo kebab, undoubtedly. Without a hole dug out in your pocket, you will leave contended. The sizzlers here too are worth your appreciation. Savour each bite.

Nothing can compare to their exotic sizzlers!! Your food trip in Kolkata is incomplete without homage to this place. The old world charm of an era gone by is reminiscent in the food. Must visit!

So many reviews already but why am I writting about it??..
May be because I hav been there unkept number of times...
May be the because I will always be of fond of the House Spl Sizzler..
May be because the Bloody Mary there makes me thirsty for more..
May be for the uniformity of each and every dish that they deliver everytime without any changes..(almost like frozen food)
May be the because its one of the places where I dont get annoyed while waiting in queue..
May be....forget it there are many more..;)

Every time I go there I just feel satisfied. Amazing food and a very good ambience. They serve hot food and quickly. The Chello Kebab is an exquisite dish you find here and it's the best. Starters like Tandoori Brocolli are mouth watering. It is one of those places which has a waiting on every weak day. So that speaks for itself. Not to be missed at any cost!

One of the oldest restaurants of kolkata. Whenever u think about Peter cat, the first thing which comes in mind is chelo kebab and it's mouth watering sizzlers. Getting a table here without having to wait during the weekends is impossible. I hav never tried anything else than chelo and sizzlers here..  The chicken steak sizzler is just mouth watering. Go and grab the chelo and sizzler..  Yumm..

Often the hype around a place makes the place look duller in person and so happened with Peter Cat. After waiting an hour on a hot Sunday afternoon we finally got a table. The place was dimly lit and had a feel of the 70's. On a better day it might have looked nostalgic.

We had the Chelo kebabs which were delectable but didn't quite live up to the expectations, Mutton seekh kebabs were good. But what really stood out was the Fish Makhmali and their cocktails, Sunset and Planter's Punch to be exact.

This place is definitely worth a visit.

Well what can I say about this establishment. Mere words are not enough. You have to be there to experience how good it is. Right from the ambience to the service everything is top notch. Though the wait outside the restaurant can be a bit frustrating, it's worth it. Their signature dish the Chelo Kabab, along with their wide range of sizzlers make you a die hard fan of this place.

nothing to say much about this place, has to be one top places to dine,  it's as iconic as Park Street itself, making chello kebab & sizzlers synonymous with its own brand & I'm sure this holds a special place to all the foddies having their roots deep down to this city.

eye catching decor, soft dim lights, delicious food & that special smell of sizzlers sizzling around, no doubt you would always see huge queue outside & they worth it completely 

this place goes straight to the top half in the list of some elite places where you can soak a bit of Park Street & more than that a bit of Kolkata while enjoying deliciously good food... Of course

Location: You know where it is... The iconic location, Park Street - Stephen House.¬†
Ambience: Ohhhh! I love the lamps. This dimply-lit serenity will never disappoint you if you love chelo kababs. It's the perfect place for a romantic rendezvous.¬†
Staff: Courteous.
Service: Prompt.
Food: Chelo kabab, chelo kabab and chelo kabab! Once tasted the house special sizzler as well. I am absolutely in love with the chelo kabab served here. Tasty, succulent, juicy, sumptuous, flavoursome, mouth-watering... I can go on and on... The rice mixed with butter tastes heavenly here! Maybe, that's the combined effort of the name and its enchanting and enticing atmosphere. That's how I feel about this place. This place has never disappointed me with the chelo kabab. and I love this place for that. I did not like the way the house special sizzler tasted. Others might like it. But, it's not the kind of taste I prefer.
Would I re-visit? Have been re-visiting this place since...I don't know when.

Heard a lot about this restaurant, and finally got the opportunity to visit this legendary place. Though it is famous for its so called Chello Kebabs but to be honest their Chello Kebab did not live up to the hype, rather i have tasted better Chello Kebabs than this. Though i know one bad review about a particular item does not change its overall endeavor.

Limited Options for Vegetarians, Ambience is top class, Service is good & Prompt 
Started with Tomato Soup which was impressive, perfectly flavored & cooked. Loved it. 
Ordered tandoor broccoli for starters as recommended by the manager there, and must admit it was damn good. It is not usual tandoori masala types but it was a little bland which infact worked for me surprisingly, it was really good. Now the main course peas pulao was great, perfectly prepared. Pineapple Raita was a huge let down, I didn't expect that (Maybe it might be served liked that in Kolkata) but by Mumbai standards it was let down, it had mishti doi as the base chopped pineapple spread over it that's it. One paneer dish was fine not great, roti were crisp n good. Overall my pineapple Raita & paneer sabzi disappointed me so much that I didn't even order dessert.

We kolkatans literally swear by the sizzlers and chelo kebabs one can never get enough.
The appetizers was a bit of disappointment, both the chilli baby corn and salad lacked seasoning. But the chelo kebab and makhreesh more than mad up for it.
Desserts was bang on. service was prompt.
perfect evening.

We were a group of 6 friends. we ordered chicken kebabs as starter, and in main course, the legendary Chelo Kabab. 
Two of us ordered Dum Ki Raan also. 

I am a regular in this restaurant since 1997. I used to come with my father. And since then what I have observed is, the pace of their service is quite slow sometimes. 

Kebab was Okay; nothing special to mention. 
And for chelo kabab their standard is almost similar since past 15-20 years I believe. 
Though if the quality of rice would be a bit better, that would have created real magic. I found the quality of rice (boiling), not too perfect that day. 

Dum ki raan was the show stellar. 
Perfectly boiled lamb and the thickness of the gravy was just perfect. 

Any given day I would suggest either Chelo kabab or Dum Ki Raan here. 

Apart from these two jewels, other offerings are good, but nothing special to stimulate your taste buds.

There are certain restaurants about which you grow up hearing and thus you develop an earnest to go there sometime... Peter Cat was such a place to me... Amazing experience... Better off going on a weekday... I went on a saturday and had to wait for around 50 minutes before managing to get a seat... Needless to say, Chello Kabab is a must...

Hi,

I like the decor. It's cozy with 70s style. It was our first visit and we ordered the Chelo Kabab.  Only. The waiter looked annoyed that we ordered only one dish because we have taken a table which could get them more orders and money and tips. That was my first turn off. 

The service took a long time and the waiter kept asking 'Anything else, Ma'am'. Why the hurry?! I am a customer too probably a cheap customer but nevertheless a customer. I could have been Loyal to you, Peter Cat but you were rude to me. 

We will never be Loyals! Ha!

Btw, your Chelo Kebab was nothing worth remembering. 

Best of Luck.

Being from Kolkata, certain places are ingrained in your growing up years food wise. This place certainly ranks high in the list. Restaurants sadly are identified or labelled by a signature dish these days and this, kind of hinders the patron's choice of ordering something apart from that. Yes, I am referring to the czars of all the food here - the chello kebab. No doubt it is the tastiest and classiest original you could get here but it is sheer injustice to the other equally brilliant dishes that they have.
I am pretty sure no one orders continental and sandwiches here although they take up quite a significant real estate on the menu cards. I talk out of experience. Okay enough brooding but the review is to celebrate what is supposed to be a culinary revelation - the chellos and of course they are something to be relished with pleasure. It is a plate full of meaty goodness (if you opt for the mutton variant) and I simply love the coal-charred tomato they serve along with it and the buttered rice. This is a close relative to an Iranian dish called the koobi-deh (if I am not horribly incorrect). The kebabs be it in this dish or from the other menu options are always succulent, juicy and meat-lover's dream.

Well this surely is a place to visit but not only for the chellos. The others need generous tastings as well you see. Dying to have my fill again. :-)

A first visit to Kolkata after years and a quick google search said go visit peter cat and try out chello kebab.

My cabbie knew the area well, so, instead of trying out the food at a few of the oberoi's famous inhouse restaurant I decided to go out to park street. Bad Idea!

Peter cats staff is nice but hospitality is not there forte.

As soon as you reach, you are greeted with a confused guy waiting at the door not knowing what the waiting time is going to be.

I finally got it, and one if the staff politely suggested that I try Chello Kebab and Zam Zam drink.

The glass could have been cleaner and I would have enjoyed my drink.

The kebabs is nothing more than mutton seekh, chicken kebabs, rice and some butter. Thats all.¬†

It wasn't a great meal but not too bad as well.

Maybe I should have tried their sizzlers or visited a better place.

Kolkata I am sure you can provide better food!~

Same decor.. same food.. same taste :)
Truly 'The' Pioneer of Chelo Kebabs, Peter Cat serves amazing sizzlers too.
What we tried was Chelo kebab, Chicken steak sizzler and Fish makhmali.
The food was amazing..!

Once you visit this place you will see why so many foodies recommend this place! There is a reason why there's always a queue outside this place - getting a table without having to stand in queue is almost an impossibility; once you get in and get served, you will realise its worth the wait. This place is a must-visit!

Ordered the Famous Chelo Kabab for all for which this place is famous of.
Absolutely Gorgeous.
Also ordered Fish Sizzlers and Mixed Grill Sizzlers a plate each. The fish dish was awesome, seems a Bhetki platter. The mixed grill was out of the world with Chicken, Mutton, Paneer, Prawn grills constituting the plate. Service is fine and prompt.
Chello Kabab cost @334, Mixed Grill sizzler @360 & Fish sizzler @330.
Would recommend having Wi-Fi for the customers as well.

Went before independence day... The ambience reeled me in as it was my first time at Peter's ..waiters were polite.. Ordered cream of chicken asparagus ...delicious! Silky smooth , chunky juicy chicken were in the melody.. Rich flavours. Next up sizzlers - the chicken was tender and the gravy was exquisite but the potato  wedges in it were perhaps too mainstream for me... Then comes the chelo... Not as good as i thought.. The kebabs were light but the chicken kebabs were little over cooked.. Altogether, nice evening spent

Peter cat is one of the legendary restuarants of kolkata in park strt area and very famous since it started long back. We went there on a weekday and we had to wait for about 20 mins to enter. As soon as you get in, the staff greets you and treats you well.
The ambiance was very comfy and sophsticated.
We ordered there speciality chelo kabab,which had two kinds of kababs on a bed of rice with butter salad making it a complete meal. Though the chelo is hyped i liked their sizzlers more. The prawn cocktail was a delight! The staff were very warm and prompt to serve us.Needless to say their food and drinks were well upto the mark.would love to visit again for sure!!

Truly a legend! I wonder what we ought to call it- Peter Cat ... Or perhaps Chelo Kebab. Well that was what we went for, and indeed it never fails to please. That sense altering exquisite butter molten feeling of the rice with that incredible tastebud tingling meat...that is the glutton's paradise in the truest sense. The ambience never fails to make you smile either. But a tip for the newbies... The Cat has more to it that just that famed dish! Do try the Shah Nauz if you are in the mood for some an exhilarating plunge into the world of taste. And those "oh-so-delightful" cocktails... they bring alcohol a new look altogether indeed. Try the Poca Cosa if you're hesitant. And for the mighty livered - the Zam Zam!

One of the biggest legends in kolkata cuisine!  This place does not need any introduction at all. The huge queue outside the restaurant should speak for itself. The place is huge! Covers two floors and even then it is not enough to accommodate so many people. This is the grand daddy of all the restaurants in the city. The most famous dish here is the Chelo Kebab and it deserves respect! The other dishes are exceptionally well made too, and the desserts are impeccable!  Everything about this restaurant is top notch. Some of the services provided by the waiter wasn't very well pleasant so it doesn't get a 5 in my opinion.  But when the food hits the taste buds, these things didn't hold much weight at all! If you are going there for the first time, Chelo Kebab is the dish to go for and once you leave, it will be understood why this place holds its reputation as the legend that it is!

An extremely overhyped joint! One can not get seats most of the time. The chello kabar is the only good thing about peter cat. All the tables are cramped together and no privacy what so ever. Service is not that good and prices are quite high considering the food and the ambience. Bad experience!

Had sizzlers which is the patented dish of the place... Nice it was... As there's a saying... First impression is the last impression... As soon as i entered the restro the smell of all the dishes which included non-veg dishes was just unbearable... Trust me.. As a pure vegetarian one must not even think of entering the place..
Khaana gaya bhaad mei... If the smell can lead you to death..Jaan hai toh jahan hai...

Visited peter cat after a long time. As expected a long queue was there. Got seat after waiting for an hour and ordered the most ordered item of this restaurant -Chelo Kebab, along with cold chicken salad as starter and Bachelor's desire cocktail in drink. The salad was really good and quite filling. Then came Chelo kebab. As the salad was quite filling we really struggled to finish off the chelo but the taste of the dish prevented me from wasting it. Also ordered Planter's punch cocktail. But it was bitter. Didn't like it at all. But the rest of the foods & drinks were great. And they serve good food in reasonable price so it won't pinch your pocket. A great place indeed.

The chelo kabab was truely a meal in itself in terms of quantity and price, the veggies with the kabab sheek provided could have been cooked a little more, they were raw. Similary the size of the capsicum was bigger than the meat pieces, one thing that can be avoided. A steak should have a dinner roll with it, no point in paying 40 plus taxes fir a piece of bread, similary the steak meat chunk was batter fried and not grilled or pan pried in steak sauce which was a disappointment. Last but not the least in desert the mango souffl√© was taste less and they claimed it was there speciality üò≥. Over all dining experince was okay, the expert steward was un aware which sauce was the stake served with, waht a joke!!!!

I guess its one of the most iconic restaurant of Kolkata. It has its no charm and legacy bringing happiness from one generation aftr the other. Its ambience, lighting, decor everything gonna give a journey through time.

Anyways,coming to food part, chello kabab needs special mention and must have it kinda dish here. Fish finger n beer are good combination. You can definitely try out variety of sizzlers. But chello kabab is too good and a trademark dish of this place.

Make sure you reach bit early for lunch or dinner as getting a table here is your luck. Prior table booking is not done.

A practically clumsy space to call a resturant and overhyped to much by people of Kolkata
Except 2 renowned kebab platter
Nothing is up to the mark for restaurant that used to have such a status
The Indian food we ordered the naan was rubbery
Most of the side dishes tasted same
Due to Sunday crowd the waiter fails to manage the orders
And
Worst of all the moist just painted wall smell
If are gonna renovate
Close your restaurant
Practically I got a little paint on my shirt
Too disappointed
Never again Peter cat

What can I say about Peter Cat, save, that a classic should not be tampered with.... And that is exactly the motto of the peter cat family.... Being a Peter Cat regular since my childhood.... I have not seen the place, the decor, or the standard, quality and taste of the food change in any ways.... True slip ups happen, long waits in the queue happen... But a Peter Cat loyalist will always return... Despite all this....
So this Instalment of Peter Cat found this glutton and a fellow food Aficionado waiting for 30 mins ( a small wait considering it was a Sat afternoon), entering the restaurant ever glowing in the red orange lighting.... Scampering upstairs , grabbing a corner sofa... Plush red ... Hastily ordering Chelo Kebabs and coke.... And we were in heaven.... Our foodscape yesterday was limited to the classic favourite... Chelo Kebab.... Mutton seek kebab, chicken tikka kebabs with tomatoes, capsicum and onion, charred in a tandoor to succulent perfection, surrounding a small mound of fine long grained basmati rice, cubes of butter, grilled tomato and the legendary fried egg sunny side up...... Yet again I was in food heaven....you can't improve on perfection.... Thank God there are somethings in this world which doesn't change .. Chelo Kebab being one of them!!!! My friends being a major sweet tooth.... Ordered Meringue with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce... Which was rich and decadent.... Covered in thick lustrous chocolate sauce.... Tough the Meringue was not upto the mark and lacked that delicate cracking texture. I ordered another classic.... The cr√®me caramel.... In one word .. Awesome....
The pocket pinch as we all know is reasonable....
And the soul.... Well what can I say. Except..... I am a happy happy woman.... ;)

This is a very well known restaurant of Park street area. The chello kebab is so very famous that it needs no mention. When we last visited there our aunt was

Well, I should have written about this ages ago. Visited once. Reviews can be found pretty good in zomato. Ratings too for ambience, food, their behaviour. But I personally didn't get to see when I visited. 

It is nicely decorated, very well, seemed to have a gently calming effect. I love restaurants with soothing interior decorations. It's not so cozy. Dim lights completes it. 

Firstly, we felt very uncomfortable after sitting. Tables for two people wasn't actually for two. We didn't have space to adjust our plates. Light above the table was so dull. We told the supervisor that we are feeling a bit uncomfortable here. Even after complaining, they didn't change our table to four people tables. Even when the four people tables were empty. We had a fight literally adjusting the plates within that short space.

May be I am the only one who didn't find hospitality. I didn't find stuffs friendly. I don't like being observed while eating, talking. They were roaming around every table. They had problem when a baby cried, they had problem when a group of friends charttered. 

When it comes to food, yes it was really above average. Nothing can beat their hot smoky chelo kabab. Their mutton preparations delicious. I tried their paneer preparations with roti. That didnt satisfy me though. I loved kababs and mutton preparations. Pea pallao okayish. Wish to try their biryani and chicken preparations. Roast chicken was heavenly, highly recommended. Wish to try their sizzlers. Lastly meringue with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. They helped us choosing the desert. I feel a dinner is totally imperfect without a tempting desert.

Everybody knows what this legend is famous for. You just need to get there and wait in the queue and then hog on to your Chelo Kabab and Mixed Tandoori Grill Sizler. Most of the times you would have these two. They are that good. Biriyani's are good too. Stand out item in the desert section is Meringue with Vanilla icecream. Items are very cleverly priced and you wont feel the pinch after the food.

This restaurant is putting a solo effort in carrying the charms of 70's Calcutta. Old school staircase, Suited waiters and dimlit tables will take you to a time travel to your fathers generation. About the foods this guy deserves a bow. Chelo is a must try here and if u r a sizzler fan give ur stomach the refreshment of Fish sizzlers. Also may ask for the Chefs choice if u get confused choosing an item from it's vast variety of menu. Ideal for ur first date without giving a burn to ur pocket.

Been there once only. I am not really a sizzlers fan. Not much of an option if you are a Veg. Chelo Kababs was OK, may be I had high expectations due to many reviews on Zomato. Reach there early if you want a table as the place is always crowded. If you reach late then just get yourself listed and roam around Park Street for an hour or so. Overall, place is nicely done and not too pricy also.

A North Indian restaurant that doesn't serve chutney, especially with kebabs! Sorry, then it is simply not a North Indian restaurant.

We went to Peter Cat after reading the rave reviews posted here but we came back highly disappointed. Below is what all we ordered (in order) and what we felt about them-

1) Masala Papad
Soggy papads with too many green chillies. If we liked spicy, we would have asked for it.

2) Cream of Swet Corn, Cream of Sweet Corn Chicken and Tomato Soup
Very bland soup and when we asked for some soy sauce to improve it, we were told that they don't keep soy sauce.

3) Veg Seekh Kebab, Fish Makhmali and Chilly Babycorn
The fish was good and the kebabs were okay but then when we asked for chutney, we were told that the restaurant hasn't served green mint chutney since its inception in 1975. Wow! Some fun fact that was. The babycorns arrived after we had forgotten about them and were okay (my friends didn't like but I foound them okay).

4) Nentara, Begum Bahar, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Dal Makhni
5) Assorted breads- Garlic and Butter Nan, Tandoori Roti, Laccha Paratha
Chicken and dal were good but Nentara and Begum Bahar didn't quite taste that good. 
What is with the thickness of their breads? We found it to be too thick. 

We went to dine out after more than a month of a hectic college life and for all of us, it was our first visit to a proper dining place after arriving here in Kolkata and least to say we were disappointed with the limited options in the menu and the taste of food.

Quality and hospitality were top notch and an extra 0.5 only for that but the service was slow- We had to ask for our table to be cleared multiple times and no bowls were given (again, they do not give bowls). 

All in all, not a great experience.

Had heard a lot about this place from friends so went on their suggestion. Was expecting a lot since i had heard so much but was utterly disappointed. 
The menu seems to be so limited. 
Whatever i ordered none of it was anything great very ordinary taste. 
For starters i ordered Chicken tikka kebab and chilly prawns. Specially told them to make it less spicy but it was spicy as hell literally water from eyes nose and stomach burning !!!! 
For main course ordered for :
Garlic naan which had like a few pieces of garlic sprinkled on it n it was thick like a pizza crust :/ dont know how difficult can it be to get a naan right !! 
Chicken reshmi butter masala - not bad not great so-so ! 
And ordered for the famous chelo kebab and was utterly disappointed! It was just like any other ordinary kebabs nothing special !! Only  thing i liked was the butter with rice with it üò™ 
For deserts - got the brownie with ice cream which was surprisingly very tasty !!! 
Didnt have a good experience or like the food. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone or go there again. Bar-b-q will be a better option anyday.

I went to see Kolkata as I have never been to this place before. As i'm that sorta person who kinda researches the best places to see and eat before visiting, i was kind of bugging my friends for the same for places in kolkata. All of them unanimously suggested this place.

So on a fine day after a lot of sight seeing and travelling, I end up outside the door of Peter cat only to see a big line of people waiting. I was mesmerized how a place could attract so much of attention in an area like park Street where every place looked worth going.

I went inside and ordered the most famous chelo kebab and chick fried rice. And oh my god! What an experience it was. Though I'm thatuch much of a rice person, the dish was so delicious and lip smacking good that I ate twice of my appetite :-p it was in itself an amazing experience and would suggest people to try this place.

In short, this will be be one of the things I would remember and write in my #Kolkata_diaries

One of the best places to go and celebrate. I visited there last birthday and ever since, it has become one of my favorite places! 
Coming to the food, don't forget to try the Sizzlers. This place is famous for their in-house sizzlers and they specialize in this unique preparation of steak. The mutton steak as well as chicken steak both are top notch preparations. Chelo Kabab is another dish which makes this place stands out. Desserts are good too, but it is the main cuisine that is the ace of Peter Cat.
Now, the place itself. As I said, it's one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The ambience, the management along with the food, makes it a delightful cuisine experience.

Well, writing a review for Peter Cat is a waste of time, so let me tell you guys a story. Me and my girlfriend went for a lunch there. We decided that this time we would have something else than the popular and everybody's favourite Chelo Kebab. But I failed to control my desire for the heaven on plate but somehow my girlfriend, having nerves of steel, went for Roasted Chicken Sizzler. But the story does not end here. 

I made sure that she gets her share of the dish and I fed her from my plate which made her blush like a little girl. Well, so let me change my earlier statement to this- It was love served on a plate at Peter Cat and no one leaves this place unsatisfied. So I tell all the other dishes at the restaurant, better luck next time.

Got a chance to enter the eatery without waiting a single minute. We were fortunate as we read many reviews on zomato that people might have to wait almost an hour to get a table.
Well. We had chelo kebab original which was served with rice and dollops of butter, sunny side up egg poach, chicken kebabs and two mutton seekh kebabs.
We also ordered mutton chelo kebab which jad the same assortment except for the chicken kebabs, mutton kebabs were served. 
The mixed grilled sizzler was ordered next. It had prawn, mutton ribs, chicken breast, fish and paneer. The dish was oily.
For dessert we had meringue with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce.

Peter Cat located just of the shoulder of main Park Street, where the Music world used to be there,now Au bon Pain.You enter into a dimly lit Restro,with table on either side..Had gone for dinner with a friend,and they led us wayyy inside, first time I have gone so deep into Peter Cat.The mobile signal doesn't come there too!We ordered Fresh lime water and a drink,and of course, 2 Chelo kebabs. Mutton and Chicken kebabs,with delicious amounts of butter,and rice, makes for a quite a sumptuous meal.If you ordering Chelo,don't order a starter or anything,unless you are super hungry.They do serve nice chicken and mutton starters.A good family/friends Restro, though the inside area feel a bit claustrophobic.

This is one of the best restaurants that I have EVER been to. In my entire life.

Needless to say, they serve the BEST Chelo Kebab in the world. It was absolutely delicious!¬†

The chicken sizzler that we had ordered was great too, only there are places that beat the sizzler served here. Yet, I would prefer eating one here than any other place.

Our waiter was the nicest person ever. He did not understand Hindi or English, but somehow it was fun trying to talk to him. He genuinely wanted to serve and make it a great meal for us.

They have great ambiance, and you can see here clearly that Bengalis are big food-lovers!¬†

This is one place I can eat at consecutively for at least a week without them having disappointed me a single time.

There's usually a waiting to get inside, but believe me, it is worth the wait.

The Chello Kebab was great. So was the Veg Gratin. But the Sizzler was highly disappointing as it's supposed to be famous for Sizzlers too. The Sizzler didn't have either rice or noodles. It was just the Chello Kebabs and some potato and tomato with Brown gravy. We were looking forward to it but were disappointed.

Been there on last sunday lunch with friends.this restaurant s probably d only one to be all time crowded.i hav been there so many times earlier, but now it seems their service got deteriorated a lot. Waiting time outside and inside is so high that it will only create irritation.
 
Very slow and poor service. Those same old people am finding for last 7 yrs. I have nothing to do with that though,bt service has become slow. Tables cannot accomodate an extra plate than the no of plates per person in a table of 4.they really need to develop this infra.they will just bring nd serve u instantly. Food is ok like before. Only chelo kabas and sizzlers are their prime attraction. Somehow... got bored with their monotonic ambience and poor service, topping all is d crowd.the charm is lost..did not visit much here in last few years.

Chelo kebab....dats it....the USP of the place.The ambience with the hanging dim lamps and pathani attired stewards is refreshing in the Park Street area . And by god the place has crowd and is also crowded. Worth a meal.

Been to this place a couple of times before, yesterday again I visited this place, for lunch.
Welcomed to the nice shady ambience reminiscent of its age old charm, we got our selves a seat immediately when we arrived.
We ordered prawn cocktail n crispy chilli babycorn as starters.
The prawn cocktail was a surprise. I must say that i haven't tasted any cold starters before. A tangy, curd based, soupy affair of soft pieces of prawn settled on crushed ice...just the perfect start to the lunch. The babycorn was also nice.
Next we ordered chicken steak sizzler, chelo kebab n mixed veg grill sizzler.
The chelo kebab n chicken steak sizzler being a fan favourite or rather definition of this restaurant doesn't need any more words to describe and I won't dare to describe them. If you haven't tasted them already, you my friend, have missed out on a culture of Kolkata.
I would like to add, personally I dont like them too much, the chelo kebabs or the sizzlers, they dont go with my taste.
But every time I visit this place, I feel I'm satisfied with the food.
PS. 1100 bux for 2ppl.

Yes this place is legendary and yes the chello kebab is that good! I have fond memories of coming here on my summer vacations as a kid and feeling like I was in the cabin of a ship what with the woody, dark interior and the large booths one can take a nap in! Yes it is old school but over the years has stayed consistent with its food and loyal patrons will agree that if it ain't broke why fix it! üòâ

the place has gone down in terms of food and service. we used to carve for the chelo kebab but now a days it is best avoided. Right from the service to the food quality is downgraded considerably. Probably they are happy with the past laurels. wish them all the best, but i am not going back there again.

Even if you aren't a sucker for charming old places, Park Street's colonial boulevards might just convert you into one. Peter Cat is one of those nostalgia inducing places for anyone who has ever visited or lived in Kolkata.

We went there one Thursday afternoon, post 3, that too for lunch. Only in Kolkata will you have waiting at 330PM on a weekday! The charm of Peter Cat with the friendly chatter of complaining Bongs was infectious It was a great start!

We were seated by no nonsense turbaned waiters. They wear their ludicrous uniforms with hilarious nonchalance.

We didn't waste anytime ordering the Chicken Chello Kebabs with fresh lime sodas, the dish was recommended by friends from all over the country.

The food arrived in about 15 mins: a steaming plate with 2 chellos, a skewer of tikkas, buttered rice, veggies and cream. Definitely scrumptious! The Chello was cooked perfectly, a rarity. The Chicken of the tenderest quality and marinated for at least a day! The whole plate was beautifully wholesome. There's something about food like this that soothes you even if it isn't anything extraordinary.

It's priced reasonably: about 500 rupees per person.

The service is like all successful old time restaurants: unconcerned, efficient and very much eat quickly and get out types.

This place has quite a few reviews, so I'm definitely not belling this cat :p

Well been to this place wid few friends on my visit to kolkata last week. To start wid food i was extremely with this place. Superb and delicious food. Fablous ambiance but d only thing which may stop me from going to this place is the service. Stewards seems to br not interested in helping us to placing orders neither the food was delivered on time. Well to summarise super delicious food but the stewards needs to be more cheerful and helping.

Situated in a prime location, this is one of the oldest and busiest restaurants in the city. I have visited this place many times and the best thing I like about it is the fact that the quality of food has always been good. Be it the amazing chelo kabab or the mouth watering sizzlers they serve their best all the time. I just have one small complaint.. Guys please change the menu cards! They are too old and torn from sides. Overall I'd say that I would love to visit this place again.

Located near the park street area this place serves heritage to be precised ..a spacious restaurant having a soothing retro ambience that will sheer awaken the nostalgia amongst bong..the prices are similar to the park street restaurants

Speaking of food ,the food is quite good and there are many iconic dishes which are served here and can die for..

 However its legacy rests upon the delicious chelo kebab and the amazing sizzlers they serve here..

I have been here  for about 5/6 odd times and to be honest it has never disappointed me..

I have always wanted to put in a good word for this restaurant which is so etched in my mind wherever I go. The food and ambience of this place actually motivates me to visit kolkata again just to have a lunch or dinner here. Been going there since I was a kid , the staff have been courteous at all times and the flavours and aroma of the food there always hits you like the first time. My must eats are the minestrone soup; the house speciality chelo kabab; the grilled chicken sizzler and finally the fish makhmali.

Had gone for dinner to Chelo Kebab !! Oh wait i meant Peter Cat. But thats the legacy of the place. 8 out of 10 people there were eating some or the other Chelo!! Peter Cat is one of the legendary outlets of Kolkata which has managed to maintain its old world charm. From the looks to the lights to the waiters everything is old school. The only problem being that its way too cramped for space and good use some spacing out but sadly the perennial rush always leaves people waiting in cues.
Coming to the food, we had ordered fish fingers (served with fries and tartar sauce) with our beer. Tasted well and had a hearty portion of 8 pieces. For food all of us ordered the Chicken Chelo which was lipsmacking as always. Pocket pinch is very reasonable given that the Chelo completely fills you up.

This place is beyond anyone's wildest food expectations. I think the whole Grumpy Cat meme took their reference from this place-the original Grumpy Peter Cat with an inclination for good food. We went there on a late Sunday evening. Everything was dimly lit and only few tables had guests who stayed back even after the lunch hour was over to enjoy the ambience.
We ordered the prawn cocktail, 2 original chelo kebabs, grilled fish sizzler and lime sodas as refreshments. The prawn cocktail had that classic 80s feel about it. It was loaded with juicy prawns swimming in a tangy, creamy, mildly spicy sauce. Then came the thing these guys are famous for. The original chelo kebab containing one whole skewer of chicken kebab, rice with generous dosage of butter, fried sunny-side egg, two mutton sheekh kebabs and salad. This plate deserves a special place in food history. The chicken with its mild flavours and succulence eaten along with the butter rice that started satiating our tastebuds. I could eat three platefuls of it. The sheekh kebabs were also flavorful but here the chicken was the star of the dish. The grilled fish sizzler came sizzling to our table which had two pieces of grilled fish doused with a brown sauce, resting on a lettuce bed along with steamed veggies and roasted sticky potatoes. You could really taste the freshness of the fish and the potatoes were a star addition to this dish.
After enjoying the food, I realized why people chose to stay back way past the lunch hour. I absolutely love this place. From the staff, to the ambience and then the excellent quality of food with the grumpy cat looking over you as you eat, this place needs to be bookmarked by all.

A visit to Kolkata and Park Street is almost incomplete without stepping into Peter Cat, but beware of the queues on any given day of the week. Rightfully listed with the legendary tag, the overall feel and ambiance is very pleasing and sure to transport you decades back in time. But the main reason that foodies flock here is obviously the menu and the quality of food. They have an interesting and unique spread of items on offer and most are bound to catch your attention. Personally I have always headed straight for their legendary special... the Chelo Kebab which is a real delight of a complete meal, for all the senses. On a very recent visit, I also enjoyed their fish fingers very much, though that is something hard to go wrong with in Kolkata! The Screwdriver however, in spite of being possibly the simplest cocktail on their list was a let-down. Maybe it's better to just stick to liquors which come straight out of the bottle!
Verdict: Must experience if you are in Kolkata!

Food was served in 10 minutes.
Quantity was sufficient ( 4.5/10)

The food was at the right temperature.
In terms of quality(4.5/5) . Tasted very good and it really replenished the my taste buds. Its worth spending ur money on ,after all its Peter Cat.

It is one of the first choice for special meals. Always liked for it chelos and ambience that waiting for hours never been a matter. Recently it has disappointed me so much that I don't want to go there again. A big let down on it's signature dish chelo kebab. Kebabs were smelling bad and the onions in it seemed spoiled. It was an awful dinner treat from my side and it was such a annoying moment for me as a host. It was an unhappy meal :-(.

This is still my favourite restaurant in calcutta.  The first time I ever tasted the chelo kebab,  I knew I became a fan. The very concept of the food moved to a great extent. The butter on the fine rice, the charcoal grilled chicken. Even the mutton chelo is delicious.  The stakes are also a favourite of mine. I don't recall ordering anything beyond the two on my visits to this place.

This is situated in Park Street, the heart of Kolkata. The food is exceptionally good especially the sizzlers and a dish called 'chello kebab'. If you come here Chello kebab is a must try. Also their Continental and Indian dishes are also amazing. The ambiance is extremely good and warm. Prawn Cocktail which is an apetizer is to die for. The only problem is it gets very crowded during the lunch and dining hours. You need to wait for around 30 mins to get a table especially during weekends. This is a must visit for every individual who considers himself to be a foodie.

This place is definitely one that Calcutta should take pride in. Personally I keep going back to the place for the old school nostalgia and obviously the amazing Chelo Kebabs. The sizzlers are also to die for but my personal favourite would be Betki Murkier. Yum is the word! They have a pretty interesting bar menu, with caricatures for each cocktail. The staff is also welcoming and friendly. Come in comfortable shoes during the weekend, an inevitably long queue awaits you.

What can be said more in terms of decor and food? Pure Royalty. Like how we used to read about the days of British Raj in our history books.

Excellent ambiance. Quiet. Great for a Date. The decor was all about hanging light-shade.

Food wise. Ordered the Chelo-Kebab. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.
Went with a whole load of expectations from the Chelo-Kebab. Was partially met. The mutton kebab was succulent. Probably they could work on the white rice accompaniment. It lets the kebabs run the show. But they were a bit of a downer really.

Service. Snooty. Not very friendly. Just like the decor was of the British era. So was the mentality of the staff there. Not courteous, customer friendly.

Would I visit again? Yes. A lot more to explore

A legendary name - Peter Cat- and a personal favourite of mine. This place has not yet dissapointed me in any way. The interiors are dim, cosy and soothing with the red sofas & the hanging lamps. Perfect place for a meal with friends or family or one's significant other..

Among the food items I have tried over my numerous visits, the most famous dish of this place, The Original Chelo Kebab, needs no special mention. It is delicious & one plate makes for a fulfilling meal for one. Among the starters, Fish Makhmali Kebab is hands down the best fish kebab I have ever had. It is soft & juicy & just melts in your mouth. The Dum-ki-raan is a boneless mutton dish made with onions & is extremely delicious. It can be had as a starter & can also be paired as a main course with their soft butter naans. The Masala Gratin is an Indianised version of the continental gratin - it has a masala flavoured cheesy white sauce. The Beckty Bell Muniere is another of my favourites - two fillets of beckty smeared in white sauce with masala potatoes & boiled veggies & pasta. Among the sizzlers, The Tandoori Mixed Grill, containing pieces of chicken, mutton, liver, fish, prawn & boiled egg in a tandoori based gravy, is good as well. The Chocolate Nut Sundae -containing two slabs of chocolate ice-cream, a chocolate wafer, some small fruit cubes(not sure of this) and a cherry on top- is a good option for dessert. And their Iced Coffee with Ice Cream is a beverage I love a lot.

I have heard many people mentioning that the service of this place is not that good, but I havent faced any problems regarding service till now & hopefully I wont be facing any such problem in the future as well.

Kudos to the place & its awesome food :)

"paisa waisa hai nahi, khaane chale aate hai"..these are the exact words that the waiter has commented after we paid the bill. Such disgusting behaviour of the staffs are never expected from a legendary restaurant such as peter cat! It was a very disappointing moment for us.We were more surprised to see a man sort of manager in suit didn't react to his rude comment. We have complained to the manager regarding this and he was bound to apologize. We had grilled chicken and tandoori chicken. No doubt the food is tasty yet the behaviour of the staffs disappointed us.

One the most happening Restaurant in Kolkata & its a must visit place. Amazing food, perfect ambience for the food &drinks lovers. Chelo Kabab is the signature dish. Only reason of concern is the long queue during weekends for dinner n weekdays for lunch. You might even have to wait for an hr to get into the restaurant. Even then its worth. Sizzlers are very good, especially when you have it with a chilled beer served in copper Mug....cheers

Historic and iconic landmark of Kolkata. It is undeniably one of the main attractions of Park Street. Nice ambience but I find the servers too pushy and interfering with your own space at times... Been here a few times and ended up having the famous chelo kabab every single time. I find the chello to be a pretty interesting combination platter of sausages , eggz and rice .. tastes really yummy.... Need to sample more items for sure.

Peter Cat definitely is the most crowded restaurant in town ! The food sucked too the core expect for those huge naans and kulchas which were stomach filling ! The chello kebab was "okayish" . The owners are just happy about it being crowded they don't want work on their plates being clean, the table cloth wherein you can see it's dirty since ages ! The lamp-shed which they have it on every table is the most dirtiest of all ! I mean it has spider webs and spiders in it ! No wonder many must have had mixed their food with these tiny little creatures .. Yuck ! There is no network too ! Bad ! Super bad ! Disappointing !

Had heard a lot about this place. Then - I went, I saw and I was conquered!
Nothing special apart from chello kabab. Food was very okay and this quality of food can be found anywhere in India and with much much better service.¬†

Behavior of staff was atrocious! I am surprised that with this rock bottom level of service, such places are still surviving in India.¬†

I wasn't getting 3G connection at my table, so I went around close to the main door to get good connectivity to book a cab (Information - In Kolkata, its very hard to get a cab after 9:30 pm even if you are in areas like Park Street). The manager came upto me and said - 'Dont stand like this near door, go out and do this'. I explained that I am not getting proper connectivity at your table and thats why I am standing here trying to book a cab. But they were adamant in sending me outside the door in rains and that they did!

Another weird thing they do is that if you are listed on their waiting list, they will only allow you to enter when all the people who are supposed to eat are present. So, if you reach before your friends and think you can grab a table for them to save time, you are mistaken. Because the staff needs to see all the faces before they can allow you in!

I guess, even if the food was from heaven, the experience leaves you tasteless!

Yesterday I visited this place with my mother
.we ordered creamy chicken soup with aspergous.it was really good . Then we tried it's signature dish "Chelo Kabab" and it was mind blowing. What I dislike in front of our table there was always 3-4 staffs standing and doing chit chat and whenever I look at them I saw they are just staring at our table which feels awkward. One more thing when I asked suggestion from the manager (the skinny man dressed in dark blue coat) about the starter or any special dish you have today , his answer is just "all are in menu card".Anyways regarding food it was good and ambience was fine.

Home to the famous chello kabab, Peter cat has been one of my most visited joints. However the current visit to this place is after 9years. To my surprise nothing much has changed. It still has the old city charm. I have had food around the globe however the food here has a nostalgia attached to it which adds to its charm. The turbaned waiters, the dim light, the bowl of "Chanachur" with the drinks. 
The kabab is their speciality and stick to it. It has sizzles too but I prefer the Indian fare.
Chello kabab, chicken Marrakesh are a must try

I wonder each time I have the chello kababs as to how do they manage to make it so awesome every single time. I always visit the place for chello kebabs and never had anything else apart from trying sizzlers a couple of times.  They were equally Delicious but Chello kebabs is what sets apart Peter Cat from rest of the restaurants.

One of the best of Calcutta. From food to interior to the staffs.

The Chelo kebabs and the sizzlers you just can't deny every time you step in. And also few of the cocktails. 

I went there on my birthday for family lunch and enjoyed to the fullest.

I would have given 5/5 if the waiting time was little less.

This place used to be one of my favorite joints in town. Not any more. I visited on the 8th of July with my friends to celebrate my birthday. By the time my cake arrived we had already had drinks and appetizers, and had even ordered the main course. However, the moment my friends entered with the cake, the management unceremoniously arrived at our table and told us that cakes weren't allowed. I understand that the restaurant may have its own policies, but there is no need to be rude. Just cause its a famous place doesn't mean that it has the license to say what it likes to its customers. When we agreed to put the cake away and just have dinner instead, the admin still did not keep their peace and kept telling us that cakes weren't allowed. We got it. What were we to do? Throw the cake away? This sort of behaviour was completely uncalled for and I can vouch for the fact that I am never returning to that place again. Sorry Peter Cat, you may be a legendary place or whatever, if you don't know how to treat your customer, you aren't worth it in my books

being a foodie form kolkata you really cannot keep from visiting this place. He who is regular to this restaurant would better call it THE PETER CAT, of course ¬†its old classic decor that too from the very heart of park street would bring that feel good moments in you. the interiors the tiffany style lamps and the soothing light and obviously the food that makes this a must visit even for the visitors who come to this city and wants to try really good food..chelo kebab is the signature dish of the house. the vegetarian variant is equally good. They serve you extra butter cubes with it.. as of the taste i wouldn't spend much words.. go and try if you haven't it wouldn't disappoint you any way. Sizzlers are also from the "must try" list esp the steak sizzler and the mixed tandoori one as well. A single visit is really not enough for this hallmark restaurant of kolkata.

This place was in my list for quiet a long time. And am sooo happyy that atlast I visited this place. This place gives the perfect picture of vintage and class. The ambience is peaceful and quiet with dimly lit lights and beautiful walls. Each table has a red light hanging from the ceiling. Another interesting thing was the menu card,  it is shaped as the face of a cat. :p
The waiters were dressed traditionally with a red turban. We ordered the traditional  # Prawn Cocktail with #Chelo kebab and #Chicken Steak sizzler. The prawn cocktail was made of sweet and sour sauce with spices. The chelo kebab was one of the best I have ever tasted. It was nicely cooked,  soft with chicken seekhs and boiled rice with butter. It was yummy and tasted awsome. The chicken sizzler was served with potato kebabs and veggies. At the end we ordered a Sunset  (mocktail ) and a pineapple juice. All over it was an awsome experience specially wen it was treated by some1. It's pocket pinch is 1.2k for 2. Thanks

i had visited this restaurant today, after hearing praises about the food. being vegetarians, i ordered chelo kabab and veg sizzler. in one word the sizzler could be summed up as " HORRIBLE". If i were to use ¬†few other adjectives, i would use "ridiculous, pathetic, distasteful, worse than the worst and unfit to pass on in the drain. a tasteless patties served with boiled carrots, beans and potato dipped in equally horrible tasting soya sauce completely ruined my impression and appetite. chelo kabab was good but i can assure all readers that much much better kababs are available at other restaurants in our city. black dal and roti was nice.¬†
the waiter serving us the food was wearing untidy clothes, oil stained kurta and unpolished shoes.¬†
You can very well avoid belling this CAT. sheer waste of money.
cost of two would be 1000 excluding drinks.
please note : i have given it one rating because 0 has not been provided for.

Food you should Order : " Mutton Chello Kebab" - The signature dish of Peter Cat.¬†
Grilled Bhetki - Juicy and Succulent Bhetki with sauces is simply astounding.Dum ki raan - Tender and Lush mutton leg cooked with premium spices which will¬†simply ask you to have more of this dish when you visit next. Been to this restaurant almost thrice and trsut me it never disappointed me except the rush in Festival time where you need to wait for an ¬†hour to get seat.

It takes years to build a reputation. Of course Peter Cat has earned what it has but you cannot solely rely on your reputation and let quality go for a toss. We love a hearty plate of Chelow kebab but the last two plates of our visits were extremely disappointing. The kebabs were dry to death. I could jab it in your heart if I wanted. Not enough butter. The rice was cold. We had also ordered a mixed sizzler. Terrible. It tasted bad, looked bad, was bad. Very upset with Peter Cat. After waiting in a queue for 40 minutes, you really want good food.

I am new to Calcutta but even I know that Peter Cat is an institution. You know that if you are in Calcutta, you have to go here and for a newcomer, all you can do is hope that it does not disappoint. True to its standing, there was a 45 minute waiting time on Sunday evening. Everything about this place says history, heritage and culture. The d√©cor is both unique and typical (you know its counterpart down the road :) ) And yet, it is all about the food. The veg chelo kebab (as wannabe as I may be :P) comes loaded with tandoori paneer and veggies, potato steak, a veg seekh kebab and buttery rice. This is a humongous plate of food and I struggled to finish the paneer. The steak and the soft, aromatic rice, I loved. My friend was delirious after having the original chelo kebab. As badly as we wanted to try desserts, we just had no space.

PS: I saw that every table has a plate of chelo kebab, that's how popular it is!

Peter cat is one of the finest eateries in town in the parkst area(yes, u know it right)! :)
It's a nice place to be with friends or family but it's of course not a place fr frequenting much for low budget school kids of college students!  But u can definitely drop in with ur parents or office colleagues anytime. 
Pros-
1) no doubt they serve excellent food but... (its in the cons section of this review)
2) the staves are good
3) good ambiance
4) cozy atmosphere

Cons-
1) its PRICY when compared with the amount and quality of food they serve.

Peter Cat...."Naam hi cafi hai". The famous restaurant in Park street area. Whenever you go, you find a queue in front of the restaurant. It is so popular for its Chelo Kabab and Sizzlers. Both are delicious. The grilled fish is must try cuisines here. Among sizzlers, chicken steak sizzler is the best. Above all a great ambience and very homely service by the waiters. The staff here is helpful and will attend you on a regular basis and after you order the food, you will be served in a very short time.

Dimly lit decor,staff in red headgear and that sizzling sound is what defines Peter Cat for me.Getting a table without standing in a que is  quite a task especially during festivities but the waiting is justified by the flavours you are provided once you are seated comfortably.Staff is helpful and efficient.What I spend on once I"m there is the legendary Chello Kabab and the Sizzling Rann ki gosht.The latter is themost amazing tender, succulent boneless mutton sizzler that I have ever come across.One unconventional dish I tried and loved was Chicken liver in barbeque sauce.Desserts are good too and the wafer that the Icecream comes with is sure to add a smile on the face.

It seems like the esteemed restaurant of Calcutta has forgotten how to behave. This review is to remind the administration the importance of good manners and how to treat their customers with courtesy. 

On the evening of July 8th, my friends and I had gone to Peter Cat to celebrate a birthday. Naturally there was a cake. Peter cat apparently doesn't allow cakes to be cut because well insecurity maybe ?

When we learnt about this we actually set the cake aside. All well till now. After a minute or so this manager comes up to us and charges us to put away the cake immediately because  it was obviously creating such a problem. And the problem was so big that he had to use a headmaster tone.

The place might serve good food. But the administration and staff needs to pull up their socks. Coming to the food bit, there is no consistency any more. One day they make amazing stuff another day it'll be pretty bleh. 

I don't know what's up with this place. It used to be really nice. Get well soon. Also if you ever apologise mean it.

Peter Cat- couldn't live upto its name and fame as when we went up there just yesterday it provided us with a really really crappy service. The over- stuffed staff there acted all high and mighty and made me wish if I could just return back what ever "food for zombies" they brought in. And lets not talk about the food- the Chicken soup with asparagus- was no soup, it was just starchy water, which stuck to my upper palate and I had to eat boiled ripe papaya from the sides of a burnt mutton burger steak( - which has destroyed my sense of taste I think) to remove the after effects of a 3rd degree burn . And the cello kabab- guys, come on! Its kebab, how hard can it be to make it a Lot more juicy??- people better get bring in good company, as the food is surely going to make the evening scorched up and dull. I would have given a -3 rating if allowed!

Visited the place on 7th July,15 around 6 in the evening. The staffs were not at all helpful to the point of being arrogant. Perhaps they judge a book by the cover. Ordered chicken soup with asparagus, mutton hamburger steak and chelo kebab. The soup had excessive corn starch, no flavor, nothing. The mutton hamburger steak was way over brunt, tasted bitter. Now coming to Chelo Kebab their signature dish. For those of you don't know, it is two types of kebabs, one chicken cubes roasted with mild spices and another prepared with minced chicken, served with a spiced steamed rice, which had a over powering taste of clove, along with a poached egg on top with very generous amount of butter. I can't quite understand why people go gaga over this dish. The both kebabs were very dry. The clovy rice with butter and poached egg, it is not something very alluring to my taste buds I should say. If you are a teetotaler and want excellent food and are brought up with the brilliant street foods of Calcutta, this is definitely not the place to go in my opinion. Way over hyped. One more thing they keep your credit card for extra-ordinary long period even if you had received the message and know that your card have been swiped, they do not return it immediately. Beware of that!

One of THE foodie destinations of the city, had been looking forward to this visit for a long time. The one problem you could say with this place is the huge demand, which results in standing in a queue outside every time you visit. But then, let me assure you, it's worth the wait.¬†
We ordered the Chello Kebab along with a Chicken steak sizzler. Both are quite big portions. The Chello is what this place is famous for, and it is justified.¬†
The service is excellent, with friendly waiting staff and all. Very nice ambiance as well. Location? Right beside where the Music World used to be on Park Street.¬†
This place is a must visit if you are in Kolkata.

One of the most popular restaurants in kolkata located in park street and it surely deserves every praise. I have never got a table instantly. This place is always so crowded i have had to wait for at least 15mins (weekdays) or almost 45mins (weekends) for a table. 
Now to let the tables get cleared fast, their service is fast and i will say quite efficient. 
What you must try are the CHELO KEBABS and also all the sizzlers they offer specially the house special or the roast chicken. The tandoori mixed grill is a but spicy . 
I dont remember being disappointed with what i was served. 
Only down side, the deserts. Needs more options and better preparations.

Peter cat is all about nostalgia and what is peter cat without it's smoking hot chelo kebab. Since childhood I have been visiting Peter cat and I have tried out almost all their dishes. However, it is the Chelo kebab that tops my list. The sumptuous dollop of butter smothered in rice beautifully settled between steaks and Paneer kebab is a heavenly experience. The pineapple-vodka combination was light and perfect for our mini little afternoon fiesta!

Love you Peter cat :)

Chelo kebabs are the centre attraction of Peter Cat.Their famous and appealing chelo kebabs prepared in rare spices,blended with persian herbs and served on a bed of rice with butter and egg.It was just fantastic and finger licking.One chelo kebab is enough for a person to dine at a time.Other dishes are also as divine as chelo kebab like chicken tandoori, chicken tikka but biryani is not satisfying. Services are good and staffs are well mannered. Nice ambience. Must visit if you are a kebab lover.

Do I have anything to add new for this awesome place? All of the ranking is attributed to the food here. The team is quite helpful and were quick in suggesting the mocktail we should have. We had chelo kababs which is likely and for the taste, and presentation of the food, I have no words...it was so good. The food is full worth the price. However I feel they should have some space for waiting outside as the waiting area is right in front on the road. The restaurant will remain popular for a long time is my guess.

Just came back from a family dinner from this much heard about place.

Chelo Kebabs their signature dish was just as ordinary as it could be. And the preparation clearly told us it could never had been great in first place. Chelo Kebabs were preceded by Irani Kebabs and Fish Sizzlers which again were extremely disappointing. And then the totally useless Paneer Makhanwala with perfectly tasteless Tandoori Rotis
To top it all the drinks served - John Collins , Whiskey Sour , and finally a half-hearted attempt at getting a decent Beer made the outing miserable.Overall not happy with even a single thing ordered. The food maybe be to the liking of Bengali community taste , but certainly cannot be liked by any other I dian community for sure , especially those from the North

The mecca of the mouth watering Chello Kebabs,located at the heart of the city will not leave you "heart-broken" :P

Going there and missing the chello kebab will be a sin. So do try that. And its an awesome place to hangout anytime-be it weekend,weekday or holiday. :)

Alawys have to get in a line & wait for nearly half an hour to get into the restaurant.....the only speciality of theirs is the "Chelo kabab"....Sizzlers themselves were not too bad either, especially the grilled fish one.

I discovered this place while I was still in school. What can I say that hasn't been said before? A delectable spread with very reasonable rates. The cocktails are nice and easy on the wallet too. My personal favorites are Chicken Steak Sizzler, Roast Chicken, Afghani Chicken, Harem's Joy, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,¬† Keema Naan and many more. I am sure I missed out on something. However, although many are gonna disagree with me, I do not like their Chelo Kabab at all. I have always found it to be pretty average. Hope I could help you guys out. Happy dining!

Placed at the heart of the city. A 'legendary' name of park street is crowded most of the time.a place with choice of sizzlers and tasty chelo kebabs with wine or some drink makes the evening.nothing much to talk about the ambience as food does all the magic..

Nothing special. Their signature dish is chello kebabs which used to be WOW once upon a time but not any more. They are other places that make as good, or better. 
Their cocktails and alcohol are pretty reasonable. 
The food, mainly afghani with similar flavours is good. Nothing more. 
Price reasonable. 
Go there if you just want some food and bar-b-q is full(which generally is).

Well ,Peter cat has been the talk of the town for quite a some time now for their chello kebabs. So, i had been to this place yesterday with one of my friend for lunch. Firstly, to dine at peter cat you would've to wait in the cue for some time just to get a table as it is so crowdy in there! But than again having said that the food they serve is worth all your wait. After you enter the place the thing that would grab your eyeballs are the decor and dimmed lights hanging around and the ambience is pretty good too. We tried their chello kebabs and Keema nan. I thought the chello kebab was great(highly recommended) and I would love to have it again the next time I visit. The keema nan was good too. I felt the staffs were in a hurry to just take your order and make you leave after you are done . But I do get it ,as there are too many people waiting outside. Overall , its a pretty good place to dine in with your family & friends.  Worth all the money that's being spent

Peter cat.. The name itself is enough for kolkata-ians to understand.. This year i celebrated my birthday here. Then again, as a reviewer i have to describe my experience over here.. Haha.. Anyways, coming to the location, though most of the people knows, still for the newbies, its in park street just in the lane next to flurys' and an bon pain (previously music world outlet). We had to write our names and wait for approx 10 mins. As we entered, i was quiet mesmerized with the ambience, dim litted, attentive staffs and the smell of food.. Just wow.. Look is vintage one and also the staffs were wearing pathan suits with turban on their head which added more authentic look to the ambience. Coming to the food, peter cat is famous for chello kebab.. Everybody goes there for chello kebab only. Apart from that you can try chicken marakesh.. Both of them are platter. We ordered fresh lime soda and a coke. The only con i found is the fresh lime soda was bit more sour than necessary. Staffs were good, foods were awesome.. Must visit for every one.. Would love to visit again to try many other dishes over there. Happy peter cating!! :)

Peter Cat is one of Kolkatas Old and Centrally located restaurants serving Indian cuisine with a bit of twist.The chello kabab is very famous here,but the quality and taste has deteriorated.Though the restaurant has maintained its inner decor and old menu,the food quality has not being upgraded.Most importantly, new dishes should and must be added coping with our mordern era.Overall its a nice experience to dine here.

Peter Cat.. Aahh.. My favorite restaurant. Been there numerous times and never been disappointed.. 
Pioneer of Chelo Kebab in Kolkata. This place is can survive only by selling Chelo Kebab.. Yes definitely there are other delicious items on the menu like the Chicken Steak Sizzler or the Chicken Marakesh or the Dum ki Rann.. 
But without Chelo Kebab your visit to this Restaurant will be incomplete. 
In Cocktails a serve a quite a few good mix.. And the catchy part is how they have named the cocktails.. 
P. S.  The only negative part is the long wait for a seat.. Avoid weekend evenings.

went on sunday with my family to peter cat. As usual you standing for 20 minutes in line to get a table. Even tough we reached there by 7.25pm we saw around 10 ppl outside there gate. One good thing about peter cat is that they do not allow there guest to go inside until they get a table which makes other guest to comfortably have their food without getting annoyed. I hope park street bbq could do the same thing. Coming to the food , chelo kebab is the star of this place. You will hardly find a table where you wont see people having this dish. Even the paneer item was also good. But i feel there mocktails and desert needs a lot improvement. Plus they even need to change the glasses in which they serve waters. Waiters are always in a hurry to take your orders. Its like eat and just go. But in terms of taste the food is awesome and there fore 4 star.

At any point of time if you want to have a table in peter cat, the waiting time is minimum 20 minutes. The staff here is helpful and will attend you on a regular basis and after you order the food, you will be served in a very short time. Now coming to food, the signature dish chelo kebab is good however to be very honest there are other places which serve better sizzlers.

The location, Park Street, is definitely an added advantage to reputation of Peter cat. 
Ironically, the name being western they serve authentic Indian and Continental food. The waiters in traditional Indian costume. 
Being a weekday, the waiting time for us was 20 mins. The restaurant is divided into two floors. People generally prefer first floor as the ambiance is better there. We tried chello kebeb and it was awesome. No second thought for the dish if you are there for first time.  
The price seems reasonable for the location ambiance.

It was a must-visit place due to the massive reputation of the Chelo Kebabs.
The ambiance was good and I was provided with a table on the upper deck of the restaurant, which I should have avoided since it is so very close to the Service door of the Restaurant. Dim lights and the waiters dressed in that fancy attire gives it somewhat of a Persian feel.
Now coming to Chelo Kebab. I was much happy with the first taste of the dish. However it was a rather bad experience or maybe my sheer luck that there was a hair that i spotted in the egg. When pointed out to the waiter, they were casual (maybe because of their huge reputation and me being a very normal guest). No apologies or anything, I was offered a replacement which was denied.
BTW, I also had the Tandoori Mixed grill which was up to the mark.
A hair and the service door was enough to ruin my experience and creates hesitation in my mind to visit the place again. Maybe someday I would give another try and it wouldn't be as bad an experience. But till then 3/5 is all I have on offer.

Worst ever experience in a restaurant that has a name in the area. Ordered a Butter Chicken and Nan. Pathetic taste and look of the butter chicken. Gravy did not look like it had any tomato in it. And it tasted very sour. In defence, the manager said,' this is how butter chicken is cooked in Peter Cat!' At least they should have named the dish differently if they were keen on having some alien dish on their menu. Really pathetic on grievance redressal, and no importance to customer complaints.

Peter cat , the name itself sends you to the 1960's era , let apart the ambience, with beautiful dim lights , wooden staircase  etc.
The chelo kabas and the vegetable steak/chicken steak sizzlers are lip smakingly good.
The best chelo kababs in town.
But service horrible.
Restaurant waiters have very rude behaviour , you cant ask them about dishes, they get annoyed.
Only the food brings us back to this place from time to time.

I was super duper excited to try the famous Chelo kabab but it was, frankly, just okay. The dish wasnt memorable at all. But the dish that blew the socks off of me was beckty muniere. That was just incredible dish i have ever tasted in my entire life. The white sauce has the perfect blend of seasoning and creaminess. The fish (im guessing cod or something similar) was cooked to perfection. Perfect dish for me. 
Chelo kabab - 3.5/5
Beckty Muniere - 5/5
Other than that, the place seems always packed but we were fortunate to get a table pretty quickly. Very nice ambiance. The pricing is not pocket friendly but thats not what this place is about. You dont go here to hog, you go here to relish!

Peter Cat is a famous name among the foodies of Kolkata.  The eatery is known for it's delicious Chelo kebab. The restaurant serves various other North Indian dishes. The decor is pleasant and soothing and the staffs are efficient and friendly. The restaurant offers quick service and is a good choice for a family dining. The only big issue with Peter Cat is the long waiting que,  especially on weekends before one can even enter the restaurant.  The staffs out there to manage the que is not very efficient and often behave a bit rudely. The average waiting time is almost an hour in weekends. The recent visit to this eatery was not very pleasant to me and my friends. After an hour-long wait, we managed an entry, and as usual ordered their signature dish. Everything except the reshmi kebabs were cold. This was not expected a few years back. The food quality is also degraded a bit. I wish the authority should take some seriuos measures to bring back the previous glory. In summary, Peter Cat is still a very good choice for family dining with resonable prices,  only if you have enough patience to wait for your turn.

Some restaurants are legends and Peter Cat is one of them. Surely for their speciality, the Chelo Kebabs and sizzlers. The dimly lit restaurant round the corner has every bit of a vintage feel to it. If you are in Kolkata for the first time, this place is worth a visit because you would savor the exquisite taste. But be prepared to stand in long queue for a table.

There comes a time when some legends should either retire or reinvent themselves into a new avatar, the latter not without risks, to remain current and relevant. 

Unfortunately Peter Cat isn't doing either. Carrying on its age old, phew, menu, linen, uniform and service standards just doesn't stand up as charming anymore. The food, including the chart busting Cello Kabab and Tandoori Grill, are tired, one toilet only for a place that is crowded and a layout with tables that get you a knock on your head if you're unlucky to sit smack behind the service counter just doesn't stack up.

But I must say my experience did not make me that happy. Again as most of the restaurants in parksteet, d ambience is top notch. I loved their wooden staircase and those dim lights. Also they have a great stuff who r well acquainted wd d menu and u feel a certain warmth in their treatment which makes ur experience better. 
   Now d food...we ordered chelo kebab and house special sizzler. I liked d kebab....d taste was really different. But somehow i found d sizzler not so good as i had expected. The taste was very bland and d gravy tasted like mango pickle to meüòù but I loved d way it was served.

Peter cat! When we hear its name , the first thing that comes in our mind is chelo kababs! The second visit of mine with my friends and it was one of the best food outings I ever had! 
Biriyani ala kashmiri! Being a foodie, I have tried a lot of biriyanis from various places but this was just SUPER AWESOME! Chelo kabab was as usual very good! Tandoori mixed grill which is passionately recommended , again was a mixed sizzler without any rice or noodles! It had everything starting from chicken to mutton and prawns!
The desserts were also pretty good but creme caramel was a bit disappointing! 
And how could I miss this! This time we just had to wait for approximately 8 minutes to get a table which was pretty shocking and good!

We ordered the traditional chelo kabab, a special chicken steak sizzler, coke and ice creme. I must say the taste was very good. Really liked it but the quantity is not up to mark. Price was high. You have to pay almost Rs. 400(with tax) for a chelo kabab.

There's no other place which indulges your nostalgia as vividly as Peter Cat.Yes the decor might be slightly austere, but the chelo kebabs served here more than make up for any slights that this little piece of Heaven might have inadvertently conceded.With a burgeoning plethora of restaurants vying to be a part of Park Street's charm,Peter Cat always has and always will be ahead of the curve.

     Chelo kebabs and grilled fish are must try cuisines here. Among sizzlers chicken steak sizzler is the best. Above all a great ambience and very homely service by the waiters.

Went to Peter Cat with my family for lunch last week on our trip to Calcutta. Nice ambience and the service is great. Had to wait sometime to get our seats but the food was great. Their Chelo kebabs are a must try so are the prawns curry and the sizzlers. Loved the experience.

Legendary food...legendary ambience and a Legendary queue to get in...Peter Cat is like 'Legend-wait for it-dary' 
Frankly I don't know why people prefer the chelo kebab here...I found it to be very bland and ordinary.What's so special about a kebab n rice platter with a dab of butter?
TRY the sizzlers....any sizzler...doesn't matter.

Peter cat..an old 70's themed restaurant..! Recently had an opportunity to visit the place with my mom and her colleagues! Everybody in that group was just too excited to visit the place. It was Sunday and hence the waiting time for our group of 13 was more than 2 hours! I thought I won't regret it, if the food would cast its magic on me. Finally after the long long wait our turn came.. It was wonderfully decorated and the ambience was nice. Everybody had heard a lots about Chelo kebab and Prawn Cocktail and without any hesitation everybody decided to stick to it.. As my mom had ordered Chicken Chelo kebab, I decided to try something different, so I tried Shah Nauz... One taste into the dish.... Awful , disgusting!!! The menu describes that it contains spring chicken stuffed with mutton kheema and chicken liver....in reality it contains two pieces of chicken in an ocean of chicken liver and egg kheema with no sight of mutton kheema..! Now the Chelo kebab.. Any body who would have ever stayed in Hyderabad would laugh out loud on the first sight... So what is Chelo kabab... White biriyani rice with a lump of butter and an egg poch on it.. This is flanked by two chicken sheekh kebab, and four pieces of chicken tikka kebab stuffed in green vegetables!! Taste is even not that great and cost more than 300 rupees.! Waste. Any restaurant in Hyderabad serves more tasty kebab at much less price .. The only thing that I liked was the Prawn Cocktail still its over priced. Truely an overhyped place, and a 1 timer..!! Sorry Peter Cat, I didn't like you, nor did my mom!

Roast chicken sizzler, grilled chicken sizzler, fish sizzler and mixed sizzler are definitely worth trying..
Apart from this I like their fish makhmali which just melts in your mouth... Great starter to have with drinks...
I generally don't drink at peter cat, but I love their special cocktail zam zam...which has a slightly citric taste

Food is excellent & service very fast. Their signature dish Chelo Kabab is worth trying. But the place is very crammed so if you are a guy who wants to spend some time with your drink, food, family & friends go somewhere else.  This place is normally full during weekends and they have very few tables to accommodate more than 4 people so be ready for a long long wait & to top it up they don‚Äôt entertain advance booking.

Easy to find , its just opposite to KFC about 15 min walk from the metro station. Nice ambiance and decor the place is always moderately or fully filled with people ( though i never had to wait for a table).

Now coming to the food topic . Its clean, yummy, mouth watering and sufficient ( quantity matters for me most of the times lol) . Though the¬† famous dishes are a must here but you can try your choice also.¬† Love the chello kebab here , mainly the kebab ( not a very big fan of plain white rice) ... all the sizzlers are great , liked the tandoori aloo and fish makhmali , you can try the today's chicken special kebab ( its a real surprise sometimes). The burgers are OK ( won't like it if you are a burger fan ) . The gentle murderer is nice ..

So to sum it all up the place is worth going to ...

Well, there are already a large number of reviews for this legendary place, I wonder if there remains something new to say about this place! ;)
I visited this restaurant for the first time about 8-9yrs ago, and was mesmerized by the fine dining experience. The place has retained its reputation for so many years thanks to their incredible "chelo kabab" dish. Apart from this I love their perfectly cooked, tasty chicken steak sizzlar. Though I feel the tandoori and other starters are a bit expensive, but the tandoori possesses almost perfect smoky flavour. Recently I visited this place with my friends and had a delicious and sumptuous meal within budget. 
I would recommend to try chicken/mutton steak sizzlar, kebabs and peter cat special tandoori apart from chelo kababs. Its a must visit place for foodies in Kolkata. :)

The place in Park Street area was beautiful,  the decor was good...The seating arrangements are done well.... At this place on every table u cud either see chelo kebab or sizzlers.... 
We had chelo kebab,the butter rice was ok ok n the kebab was good...
Then we had chicken steak sizzler which I didn't like that much, but the grilled chicken sizzlers were good. 
This was the first time I had sizzler n it was good xperience as it sizzles so much....
In drinks we ordered Virgin Mary, iced coffee wid ice cream, pineapple juice, Kingfisher beer... Virgin Mary was really bad, it tasted like cold soup being served wid salt..n it was over priced....The pineapple juice didn't have sugar it was little tasteless....The beer was good....The best was iced coffee wid ice cream, it was amazing n was worth the money......

Went to this restaurant the previous weekend. We walked up to Peter Cat and bam! seat was available as it was around 4-5pm. Ordered 2 Brandy Collins, 1 Cream of Spring Chicken Soup(1/2), 1 Bread Roll, 1 Grilled Chicken Sizzler and the 'famous' Chelo Kebab.

The order came in, 1 Brandy Collins instead of 2. The drink was not that great to me so it somehow went good (we never reminded them about the second drink).

Second, its time for the Soup, 1 bowl full Soup came in, we informed it was ordered as 1/2 each for both. The waiter went back and divided the soup and served.

No bread rolls still........

The waiter was around serving the other tables, we called him up again to finally bestow us with some Bread Rolls. Served. The Soup was so good that we were actually waiting for the Bread Roll for rescue. Thank God! the Bread rolls went down alongwith the soup.

Its time for the Grilled Chicken Sizzler. What I can see is a mammoth platter with two pieces of chicken lying around with some steamed carrot and beans. Period.

The 'famous' Chelo Kebab came at last, its actually some roasted chicken with some mutton steaks (I dont actually know what was that) and rice with salt and dripping butter.

I dont know why I had such a horrific experience, but to me the fault lies within the starter soup maybe? For me the starters set the mood for the eating session that is about to begin. The Cream of Spring Chicken Soup put all the nails properly to the apetite. Ciao

It's one of the best restaurants I have attended.
But I think the chelo kabab may be overrated.The sausages that came with the chelo kababs were hardly edible.
Dum ki Raan was awesome,the spiciness was perfect.
The place was a bit crowded and ambiance was sort of an issue.
Overall my experience was good.

If you don't mind waiting outside for a while, since the place is usually full, then the dull red lighting and the brilliant food inside makes up for it. Even if the wait annoys you before you enter, the lovely Park Street ambience and the happy stomach you leave with will make you come back again very soon! Order beer and chelo kebabs!

Visited this legendary restaurant last week with my friends.Even though it was a weekday,we had to wait for around 45 mins to get a table. The restaurant has a very calm ambience with yellow lights over each table. The menu card is of the shape of a cat's face. We ordered the very famous CHELO KEBAB each and a House special sizzler. The Chelo Kebab was heavy and delicious. The seekh kebabs and the chicken kebabs were succulent. The rice had a unique taste. The sizzler was also very tasty. Both the dishes were very filling. I would love to taste the Chicken Marakesh on my next visit.

I dont have adequate words to say about this restaurant or rather wont be able to explain it in terms of food quality, taste, service, ambience & soo onn...

We tried one of its signature dish Chelo Kebab. One plate serves for one portion. Actually one will never like to share even a single bite from his/her portion. full marks for taste & plating. The rice, the meats, the poached egg were literally soaked in butter. This dish is a must try.
One should also try for sizzlers & mutton hamburger steak. Drinks are quite expensive but one can get alot of options starting from soft drinks to lime soda & ending till international wines..
The crowd is very posh. No unnecessarily sound. No fashionable interior decoration. The service is quiet good. The managers there will help you to choose with your best combo meal. In one line elegance & excellence at its height.
Its a bit expensive place. Pre-booking is suggested. one will feel fully satisfied by spending beyond one's limit.
Thank u peter cat. I would love to visit you again & again.

Like has already been mentioned earlier, it is almost impossible to just arrive at Peter Cat and get a table without waiting in queue. However, their assortment of kebabs n sizzlers among other things make up for the wait. The Chelo Kebab is a must try. The inly demerit is maybe the fact you might need to adjust 5 people in a table for 4 which is obviously one of the perks of visiting one of the most faous n historic restaurants of kolkata!

Rated one of the best restaurant in park street area visited few years earlier, BUT a friend of mine told that it's quality is degrading nowadays. So recently I visited there and yes Peter Cat cannot fulfill my expectations. I have to wait for 40 min in a rainy Sunday, but when I entered at least 4 tables are empty in ground floor. OK I thought there must be some policy, then they show me a table for two near a serving station, then the chaos started, every time waiters serving, either they drop foods on me or shaking the table continuously. According to my point of view there should not be any table. I found the food is overpriced, quality of the food is average. Sitting arrangement is overcrowded, I think for better profit. I went there few years earlier also but now I must say the restaurant is overrated. Anyway I spend 991/- for two chello kababs (doesn't matter 991/- or 2991/- for good food ), got bitter experience. Giving this 2.5 star for future hope that Peter will come back with the best Peter Cat ever.

After i came to know about Rich History, i preferred to have lunch with my family..but i feel the place and the food quality as per the price is over hyped. Seriously.
1.inside is very dark, chances r there ,u may stumble upon.
2.Very congested, some seats where you need somebody really to pull in and out for adjustment.
3.i ordered Chelo kabab 4 plates-334 /plate
Mango juice 145 ra just a regular glass size. And regular quality.
4.The food was not warm even ,the butter placed on the top was intact till end..
5. Kabab quality is good but there no such x factor..
Put together , everything was kind of compromised..
And we did not like it..
I found it's unnecessarily over hyped..

So we wait for our turn to dig into Chelo Kebab one more time outside Peter Cat. The prawn cocktail was good and so was the quintessential dish you try here everytime you come. The space can get a bit cramped. Helpful staff. Overall a good place to try out for anyone visiting Kolkata. Natives would have spent a lot of time waiting outside for the exclusive table anyway.

Now I feel that I've actually began my food journey here after having Chelo Kebab from Peter Cat. Legen-----Wait For It----- Dary!
¬†It's a complete meal with mutton kebab, few pieces of chicken kebabs, crisp veggies, buttered rice and egg(sunny side up). It fills you and makes you delightfully happy. Though it's a little hard on your pocket but once in a while you can treat yourself. Highly Recommended for all meat lovers. Since we went here after heavy breakfast at Taj there we couldn't exactly stuff ourselves.

Highly over rated. It used to be crowded all the time and I thought it would be an amazing place but sadly when I went after wating for 1 hour in fact more than an hour we were served so bad food. Sizzlers were good but I must say the "chelo kabab" for which it is so famous was a No No. I don't know the rice they served with it was like kind of hard the like when the rice is kept out n turns cold. I guess it is because the demand for it is so High that they prepare it before hand and just heat it n serve the guest. I never went back.

No mention for people who belong to Kolkata.The historic "Chelo Kebab" ¬† is not only the most popular dish at this place but also one of the most popular in the city of Joy.This place has a lot more to offer other than the ambience and the savouring dishes.Located in the heart of famous Park Street in Kolkata they have a wide variety of cuisines.A favourite hangout for students,family people tourists and so on.The drinks are also really very resonable and yum.Please try the pineapple cosmo if you ever land up there.I also found the price very reasonable wrt the delicacy they offer.It is a must visit if you are visiting Kolkata and if you are already in town,you should hit it asap!! :)

Well to be honest I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it's famous chelow kebabs but let's be honest with the price and the positioning of this restaurant I personally felt it a little uninspiring. Considering the fact that Chelow Kebab is the national dish of Iran. The quality of the kebab was so so, and the other food items not up to the mark. I would only recommend to visit this restaurant only for having a one time experience definitely not recommended for a second time.

Yet again an over rated, over crowded place for diners.The place is dark and crowded.Very poor service.Get ready to stand in a que for atleat an hour before you dig in for a not so great over-hyped Chelo kebab.
Should not visit peter cat for ;
1. Dry Chello kebab.
2. Undercooked Steak.
3. Crowd.
4.Poor Service.

This happens when a place gets too many good reviews and is over-hyped!!

Had been a heaven for CHELO KEBAB Lovers in the city of joy... This was atleast 2yrs ago.

Now, the quantity & quality of the product has degraded so much so, that it does not deserves its price, let alone its reputation!!!

Service: 3/10 ( they keep u waiting for quite a while. :(  )

We tried Chelo Kabab there.I must say this dish is an extremely overrated dish.
The quantity they provide that is not even sufficient for one person.I was highly disappointed after having it and recommend everyone not to try the chelo kabab at least.One of my friends have tried Mutton Dopiyaja and Parathas.Those were also not upto the mark.
The only good thing about the peter cat is the ambiance and their services.Kudos to the sevice.Thats the only reason probably i gave that 1.5 rating.

I don't even know why am writing this review. Some places don't need any validation, they are a institution onto themselves. This one such place in park street.¬†

Like mocambo, it has managed to retain its old world charm and also it's clientele from the past apart from the bunch of new admirers including me. Since, we had plans to have out full meal at mocambo, we simply had our starters and drinks here.

Needless to mention Chelo Kebab was our unanimous decision accompanied by screw driver and planters punch. The chicken was succulent and juicy and no sooner had my teeth sunk into the meat did I feel the meat melting in my mouth. Old timers would be able to vouch for whether the Chelos have remained faithful to those golden days.¬†

The drinks were reasonably prized and generously served which is so unlike most restaurants in Delhi where cocktails are mere dilutions of fruit juices unless you had forewarned the waiters. Be prepared to wait in queue to grab a seat but I assure you that every minute spent outside will be more than compensated. Both the ambience and services were quite good. Highly recommended.

It's a shame if you are a kolkatan and have not yet visited this iconic restaurant. I have been there only once. I went there with my wife. Like other customers, I also tried their sizzler, prawn cocktail and chelo kebab. I liked prawn cocktail & chelo kebab. But didn't like sizzler much.

The ambience of the place is what will impress you first and the service and food play their fair part in continuing it. We had chilly fish, chelow kebab, chicken steak and the half raan sizzler. Not only was the kebab amazing (which is what the place is most famous for), the rice accompanying it was delicious too with a generous helping of butter. The half raan was the star of our meal, with the flavours and spices being just perfect. The meat was a little too tough for my liking but the spices ensured that it didn't bother me at all. The other dishes were tasty too and one visit to the place will help anybody understand why there is a long queue outside the place all the time.

We were very fortunate to grab a table for four on a Friday evening without standing in the queue.It was a birthday treat and it had to be grand and so what's better than peter cat!!
I love soup but sweet corn chicken soup here will be there right at the top.Its just delicious.
Beckty muniere was 'the dish' of the evening. It was heavenly and is highly recommended.
Tandoori mixed grill sizzler and chelo kebab then followed which deserves no mention.These are hallmark dishes of peter cat.
The best part of peter cat is there is no drop in quality following the amount of crowd that turns in everyday.
Serving time is good but a little warm approach of the waiters would have been great.
Overall had a great dining experience and looking forward to more encounters.

The first thing that comes to your mind when you hear Peter Cat is "chelo kebab", the second thing being a long queue. I know of people who visit this place every month - without fail - to have the chelo kebab - it is that good! Personally I feel the "fish muniere" and "dun ki ran" is a good alternative, in case you want to try something else.
And oh..this place is famous for their varied sizzlers. You might wanna try those too. As for me, I am not a very big fan of sizzlers, so would be able to recommend any.
The service at Peter Cat is reasonably fast, however their staff can be a tad rude at times (especially during the rush hours)..and you most definitely will have to wait in a queue to get a table here.

The 2.5 rating is for the taste of the food itself. I have been a frequent visitor to Peter Cat for the last 10 years and my last visit was on 6th June i.e. day before yesterday. I found the quantity of Chelo Kabab shrunk alarmingly via-a-vis the price. I ordered tandoori mixed sizzler and persian pulao with it. The ambiance remained the same but felt sorry to find that the maroon-colored turbans of the waiters are almost blackened with dirt and grim which was cleverly hidden by the dim-light ambiance of the diner. The jacquard jackets worn by the waiters are tattered and torn and filthy. Perhaps the management need to take a look at this along with the portions they are offering.

The memory of this place goes back to the time when I could sit in their red sofa and could hardly look over the table....kalmi kebab was what I loved most from that time.Then came chelo kabab and sizzlers(the best in Kolkata I swear).You can close your eyes and pin point on any item on the menu and its going to be tasty. Vegetarian non vegetarian anything. I love their Irani pilaf as well.

I have been here with family on dates,for celebrations and to fill grumbling tummies.Everytime I loved it.This is a place where I used to go with my father the most and it will always have that soft sugary place in my heart.

There are places that you always love to come visit again for the calmness they provide and there are such restaurants that you have have to visit from time to time, Peter cat was the one before today. Might be my last visit to the restaurant. From the saddening hospitality to the uncourteous staff to the food being terribly uncooked and the rush to seat in new customers without treating the ones already seated with the least respect and to the extent expecting them to leave at the earliest. It's heartbreaking to see Peter Cat joining the heard of mediocrity and swaying away for good from being the 'chelo Kabab' haven too. With the rating of 1, I will strongly suggest do not venture out to capture those old Calcutta feelings from Peter Cat, you will be disappointed for sure. I hope the review reaches the representatives of Peter Cat and they maybe realize that quality [Kwality] is always better than quantity, at least when we speak about food.

Went to Peter Cat with friends. Was rediscovering restaurants of Kolkata and this came highly recommended. 
Dress of the waiters reminds one of colonial days. The staff was very courteous.
They served drinks and I was glad to see that they do it on style and the glasses were proper and followed the traditional order of crockery as far as the drinks were concerned.
Ordered the Chelo Kabab and loved it. Comprised of rice, butter, kebab etc combined on a single plate and voila they worked well together. 
Will be there again soon.

Another legend of Park Street, this restaurant is on every city foodie's top 10 list. The ambience  is mellow and just about perfect. The service quick and formal. The menu is in the shape of a cat and the insides are scattered with anecdotal caricatures. The food is mouth-wateringly good. The Chello kebab is the speciality of this place so you must try it if you haven't  already done so. Also notable are the Bekti Muniere and the Chicken Steak sizzler. It doesn't get better than this!

We were craving for Chelo Kebabs and there was no better place than Peter Cat. So one fine afternoon,we finally landed here with great expectations.

Ambience- Typical vintage atmosphere with hanging lamps and quite similar to that of Mocambo! The restaurant is quite dark but It adds to the ambience and I love it.This restaurant is always full and therefore a busy humming of the guests accentuates the overall ambience of this place!
 Service- Prompt service with no apparent flaws.
Food- This place is the Mecca of Chelo Kebabs.So we ordered for the classic Chelo Kebab.Succulent chicken kebabs and mutton seekh kebab on a bed of Persian spiced buttered rice.You have to come for this dish again and again.
Next came the House Special Sizzler with Chicken Steak served with chicken liver and sausages.The Sizzlers were equally good.My love for chicken livers finally found an abode!  
We also ordered for a Screwdriver and the proportion of Vodka to orange juice  was perfect.

If you can overlook the waiting time and have got the patience to taste some good old LEGENDARY CHELO KEBABS,you should be here by now.This place definitely speaks for itself and we were extremely happy and filled to our gullet!

Brilliant place, Nice Environment, Tasty Food.
Was welcomed very hearteously to the venue. Service was quick. Worth the money spent.
I had the House Special Steak. It had chicken breast, two Sausages, few pieces of liver, and garnished with Carrots and beans, on the side i had a bread roll and 1 Heniken Pint
Costed me exact Rs. 650/-
Had to wait for my chance to get in which was approx. 20mins but it was worth the wait.
Getting back to the food. Every single bite i had was full of Flavor. I was told about this place long back but finally got a chance.
Incredible Experience. Incredible Food.

It's my favourite restaurant in the city. I abide by Peter Cat. I'm a die hard fan of their sizzlers. Grilled chicken sizzler and shrimp cocktails are my favourite when it comes to Peter Cat. But everything said and done, I find the ambiance too stuffy, especially if you do not hook yourself a seat on the second floor.
Nevertheless this place will remain my favourite forever.

One of the best fine dining experiences in Kolkata. The highly satiating chelo kebab, the delicacy named bekti muniere are my favourites. I also swear by their sizzlers. The ambience is also very nice. The fresh lime soda they serve be better avoided, it is a bit too sweet for my taste. They really know how to layer a tooty-fruity. The vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce is another dessert to savour.

Peter Cat is one of my favorite eateries in the city. Their out standing creation Chelo Kebab, just doesn't need any review. Every time I go there, even if I have to wait behind a long queue, Chelo Kebab and their sizzlers bring smile in the faces instantly. Other than Chelo, their Fish Makhmali Kebab is also a must try. I love chicken steak sizzler and grilled chicken sizzler. And then there is my favorite desert Brownie and vanilla ice cream, which they serve just the best. Though the waiters are a bit rude, but service is fast. This place is a must visit for everyone in Kolkata.

For main course this time i decided to order a sizzler rather than my all time favourite chelo kebab.i ordered house special sizzler.it has a poach, chicken steak, sausages, liver fry and potato wedges with a brown sauce..a perfect dish for a hard core non vegetarian person like me...wud recommend evryone to give it a try!

This review was long awaiting. Peter cat is featured under Legendary restaurant still it gets a 2.5 from me. Why? well let me explain. 2.5 is solely for Chelo Kebab, Tandoori Mixed Sizzler and Chicken Marakkesh. Except these three jewels Peter cat has no extraordinary of overwhelming dish to serve anybody. Whenever there is a craving for Chelo Kebab, Tandoori Mixed Sizzler and Chicken Marakkesh I visit Peter Cat or else i avoid the unnecessary and quite irritating queue.¬†
One might argue about their beckty muniere and prawn cocktail and other items , but I am sure I can find better versions of those in the other side of Park street easily.¬†
I do not hate Peter Cat but it's options are way too less to give it a good rating.

When the name is Peter Cat, you are hit by the old 70's ambience with dim lights, minimal decor and  awesome mouth watering dishes. Everything from Chello Kebab, to Chicken Steak Sizzler, to Chicken Marakesh and Prawn Cocktail is just mouth watering. A must go for every foodie in Kolkata.Thumbs down: The long queue.

One word that came to my mind while I swung open the door was WOW. Starting from the Guards to each and every waiter, every one is so courteous and well behaved. Peter Cat doesn't need any introduction. And it's mouth watering chelo kebabs and soft butter nuns and the hot sizzling sizzlers are exceptional. The dim lighting and the black,red,yellow,brown just adds to the ethnic style of the restaurant.

Well some restaurants just don't need a review. One such is the Peter Cat, Park Street. Whether you have been there or not you have heard about their impeccable reputation even outside the city. A celebrity among restaurants, both due to its heritage and location, Peter Cat is an excellent choice among solo, couple or family diners. Peter Cat has long been tempting visitors with its famous and most sought after dish the Chello kabab. Another valid reason for me to visit this wonderfully old world restaurant are its cocktails. Old Fashioned being my favourite one. The ambience and experience of the restaurant hikes it even more in the must visit list.

This restaurant only have their name remain & days why people still go there. They don't bothere about the service now a days because they know people will come to have their speciality. Me n my wife went for a lunch oredered 2 chelo kebab 1 beer n 1 screwdiver. My beer came first n they took another 5 mins for her drink. When she asked for stirrer it took another 10 mins though no1 brought dat 2 our table. When we complained to 1 of da supervisor he said I m so sorry all the stirrer is in use. We don't have much of this as wine merchants only give us few. What an excuse for such a good restaurant. Our food came before we had a sip of our drink. And da most irritating thing is the payment. If you pay by card you need to go to cashier to enter ur pin. They don't have a handheld which is most of the restaurant now. In a busy time you will feel like standing in a railway counter for ticket. As a sumup only da chelo kebab n sizzler are their usp other than this service is most irritating n disgusting.

Have been visiting this place since childhood. Always my 'lets go to' restaurant. I have this special soft corner for this place. The place looks absolutely cosy. I enjoy going in there mostly with my family, have chello
Kabab and some hard drinks to go with it. Moreover the indian dishes are terrific. Its not that expensive. Very much affordable even if you are throwing a party or treating your friends/relatives. 
P.s. - if you want to experiment anything, go for the biriyani. You would love it.

If there is one ancient restaurant in Kolkata or Calcutta as it was known when Peter Cat opened,which has not changed one bit in the way it looks it is this place.I am visiting this place for 30 years and it looks exactly the same.The same dressed Durwan or Doorman to be politically correct,the dimly lit interiors with the covered lamps almost touching your beer bottle on the table,the same liveried waiters with lots of attitude,and the stewards of mostly Anglo Indian descent who are also a vanishing tribe in a job they did better than anyone in Park Street.The one thing that has changed is the almost omnipresent waiting crowd outside at all hours which is annoying because it gives a halo to this place which I feel is unjustified and also shows that management really does not care to even provide plastic chairs for this loyal breed.
Now if interviewed 90 % customers would say that they had Chello Kabab,the supposedly famous dish of Iranian descent and also the mixed grill sizzler.
That's what we ordered along with fresh lime soda and a Bloody Mary for my drinking friend.
The Chello Kabab is a dish of several kababs like the sheesh Kabab,the chicken tikka etc on a bed of buttered rice,subtly flavoured,which definitely is an uniquely wholesome dish and Peter Cat does this perfectly.But to connoisseurs the quality of flesh will not taste the same way it was a decade back.But like the mutton chap of Shiraz,the devilled crab of Mocambo,this dish has become folklore in India.We just became willing participants.Long Live the Cat!!!!!!!

I thought it was a good place hearing all the good things about it but frankly speaking i was disappointed. At the heart a restaurant  is a place where people go to have good food apart from their home cook meals. And it was not upto par. Tried the famous chelo kebab but frankly nothing special about it.  Only the ambience was the reviving factor of this restaurant

Peter Cat is about a little bit of Old Calcutta Colonial Heritage and authentic food. They don't really go wrong with the amazing north Indian food choices and the amazing sizzlers, the Chelo Kabab being the talk of the town. Although, their mocktails aren't that great, they're pretty ordinary. The pocket pinch is on the higher side but the quantity is more than just good enough. 
Recommended: Chelo Kabab is a must have. The continental menu has nice baked chicken dishes too. 
Thumbs up : the lighting does wonders for the appetite. Good spot for an old school family brunch and beer.

Plus they served beer in a goblet-like glass...I swear it felt like Tyrion Lannister drinking out of it! :D This classic food palace is a must-go for all foodies in Kolkata.

[P.S. If you are really looking for the bad points about the place, I would say it was the ambience which was really noisy and the long queue outside the resto]

The person who took our order..I tried to look at his nameplate..alas he didn't have any..anyways physically describing him..5.8 feet, brownish..having moustache. We ordered chicken grill..he took the note..the next second we said chicken grill means that house special one. Surprisingly he got irritated. Torn the page and in a baritone voice replied ' house special ar chicken grill ki ek hoi?? age bolte parlen na?' ..was surprised..I dint say a word..afteral it would only spoil our party..but was really amazed by this kind of stuff. People pay not only to taste food..at the same time they want good respectful service. I sometimes feel @that these kind of people are being hired just to spoil the reputation of the institution. I pledged that I will never visit the place again.

The crowd outside this restaurant defines it... It is worth the wait... The dim lighting and the decorations paints a perfect picture of the old times... Reasons to visit this place is because of its beautiful ambiance and great food... The best reason however is obviously, CHELO KABAB...

Living in Kolkata for the past 8 odd years and yet never experiencing a date with probably one of the city's most famous eatery is something nobody would like to admit. A Sunday it was; a famishing, stomach, a special occasion and lots of expectations. And man was I impressed! A kooky hybridized ambiance of an oriental bar with its carpeted floor with an authentic Indian dash of colored turbans, Peter Cat's enigmatic old world charm immediately took me in. The rates were unbelievably economical. As any first timer would ( and definitely should) we ordered Chelo Kebabs and a beer to go with. Service was courteous and prompt. The Kebabs (both chicken and mutton) were cooked to perfection with an assortment of herbs and spices (which I couldn't put a finger at because the taste simple doesn't let you think much!) served with piping hot rice and a sunny side up. The grilled vegetables went great with the beer (served in metal tumblers) and the red subdued lighting being the perfect host for a dozen odd selfies/photographs (as your taste requires)Overall, a fantastic way to spend time with your family and friends. Looking forward to try the sizzlers next time.

Someone lives in kolkata , loves to eat, and dosent know about peter cat's chelo kabab is a next to impossible.
Peter cat stands in park street with all its glory and glamour. Need not to mention its an legendary restuarant of kolkata.  
Let alone the festive days, it is hard to get a seat on the weekends and even in daily peak hours. You have to wait in a long que. So i prefer to visit in odd hours.
Food: the chelo kebab and biriyani are my all time favourites. But during my last visit i wanted to try something new ,thus orderd beckty meunier and tandoori mixed grill sizzler and obviously one chelo. Both the 1st nd 2nd dish were devine. The beckty mdunier is made of boneless bhetky and cheese. It was perfectly spiced up. I will highly recomend this dish to all who likes fish. And the mixed grill was mouth watering. 
It had chicken mutton pork lamb. I also liked d grilled vegetabls served along with the meas. Nothing to mention about the chelo as they serve the best chelo in the city. And as usual their lime soda had perfect balance of sweet and salt.
Ambience is nice. The red sofas and dim lights. i like them.
Service is usualy good but this last visit of was not pleasnt. The food came too late. 
However i am eagarly waiting for a next visit and i want to try some veg dish this time.

Visited Peter Cat after a while today.

This iconic restaurant just off Park Street needs no introduction. Old world charm, super food and extremely affordable prices are some of the reasons for which people are willing to wait outside for a table, which can take more than an hour on occasions.

This is possibly the only place, where each time I visit, I tell myself that I will order something different this time, and diligently study the menu only to end up ordering Chelo Kebab for the n-th time.

Their latest innovation (about 4-5 years back) was the Mutton Chelo Kebab which is an improvement on perfection (if that is possible).

I hate waiting outside for a table, but once you enter, all the pain disappears instantly.

Portion sizes may have reduced slightly over the years, but the taste has remained the same.

Unfortunately, I have never been able to try anything else apart from the Chelo Kebab so maybe next time...

Peter Cat known to Kolkata for its Chello Kabab and Sizzlers. If you are planning to spend time and do not wish to wait on the road for hours, get inside by 6.30 pm. The only reason for me to keep going back is the laid back ambience, food quality but do not expect Good Service. Keep asking for stuff like water as well. If only the number of tables could have been replaced to make way for personalised service it would have put some best fine dining places in shame. A place serving kabab does not give any dip or sauce as compliment but has pickle kept on table top, ironically. Rating is increased due to the food quality nothing else. We spent 3 hours and at the end felt like the staff was pushing us out though the bill size was not less by any standard. I hope the management notes this and takes action.

It is never too late to write about this legendary restaurant of Calcutta. I have been going to this place since when I was a small child with my parents, and now I go there because of insistent relatives and friends visiting the city. I won‚Äôt particularly say that it has fallen from its grace, neither would I say that the place is overhyped. But I will definitely accept the fact that over the years the place has failed to retain its quality. I still find that colonial charm when I go there, but sadly apart from a few sizzlers and the Chelo Kebabs( which are still the best in Calcutta), there is hardly anything to look forward to in Peter Cat. Peter Cat represents a part of Calcutta to me which I know is flawed, but yet I love dearly. I don‚Äôt live in Calcutta anymore, but whenever I go back to my hometown, I make it a point to visit Peter Cat, to go down the memory lane and revisit the wonderful moments that I have spent there. For me and I think for most Calcuttans, Peter Cat is not just a restaurant, it‚Äôs much more than that. And it will always remain so. And I‚Äôm sure the Chelos are going to remain the same.

I think this is the most visited restaurant in Kolkata and like many others I visited this place many times. It is always crowded and we even waited for two hours in the festival times.
I always think of ordering different foods but I end up ordering chelo. I only tasted their sizzlers, biriyani and chelo kebab üò©üò© because I always order these foods. But they do taste awesome. Recently I noticed the taste of their chelo is not that good as it was before, but they are still drool worthy.
Will again try to order a different dish next time.üòãüòã

A long queue, and brilliant food at the end of the wait, is what symbolises Peter Cat. Any day of the week, any time of the day, it is impossible to get in without standing in a queue. The ambience and decor is beautiful, with the amber surroundings and the royal beer glasses. The famed Chelo Kebab is one to satisfy a meat craving of any proportion, and keeps a smile on your face for the next few hours. The sizzlers are the best in the whole city. Stand in the queue, sit, enjoy the ambience, and let Peter Cat surprise you.

The famous 'chello kebab' of this place is something, which I have heard since time immemorial. So one fine day, we, me and my fiance dropped in to indulge. It was Saturday, n trust me..had to wait for almost  40 mins to get a place. We ordered a Chello Kebab n the House spcl..Sizzler. The way  the Sizzler was served, did increase our appetite and our expectation soared high. When we took our first bite, it felt like heaven. The Chello kebab, did its part well..i.e. kept the flag of Peter Cat soaring high. We do want to go to that place often, but its more apt for those who plan ahead, and manages to get a table booked. So its a hurdle for us..bt we intend to take a bite on that yummy sizzler very soon

This was on my wishlist since ages but due to something or the other, it just never happened...it has also happened that inspite of it being a weekday, we had to wait for long outside and eventually give up and go to some other place due to lack of much options...but few days back, me and my gang hit the place and voila! It was as good as expected. A perfect dine in place. The famous chelo kebabs, sizzler and paneer tikka which we had ordered left us full but we craved for some more...it was worth every penny spent...the only drawback about the place is its lack of trained waiters. You still have to call them multiple times to grab their attention. They don't care much which is so not the case in the newly opened restaurants say for example, Irish which inspite of being overcrowded, caters to every person attentively! But the food in Peter Cat makes up for all these miniature issues!

Located in Park street, the food and party hub of the city of joy, the dim lighted soft ambience with the vintage decorum enhances the legendary cuisine, Peter cat has been offering till date. Noone should leave without going through its two signature dishes, Chelo kabab and Sizzlers (the sound heralds the name..."Chicken steak" one is good whereas the "tandoori mixed grill" one isnt really passionately recommendable ‚ò∫ ). The amount per plate is enough,not bordering on excessive. Mutton shammi kabab and chilly babycorn as appetizers... Mutton rogan josh and Chicken irani kabab as side dishes are delicious. Tutti frutti and creme caramel summed up the dessert part pretty well. Althought waiter service could have been a tad better....

Touted as one of Calcutta's classics,it does live upto this billing. Although the long queues can prove a death knell for your appetite and patience, it might be worthwhile waiting up for a seat.
The ambience is okayish and yes! Commercialism will compromise your privacy. But The food pretty much makes up for these shortcomings. 
Chelo kebab (not the mall food court types) and the Peter cat specialty sizzlers are a must have at this place.

One of the most famous continental restaurants in town, this is the one place that never seems to lose its magic touch. The long queues are an inevitable part of every visit, but the wait is certainly worth it. Apart from their famous chelo kebab, the other items to drool over are the house special sizzlers, the cold chicken salad and the chocolate souffle, one of the best souffles in town. To wash all in this down, the prawn cocktail and the rum Collins are perfect accompaniments.

There is a reason why you have to wait for so long to get hold of a table. I have only been here once and had tried their most popular dish i.e Chelo kebab. I was satisfied to the core and needless to say the food was delicious. The ambience was perfect and our order got served real quick. If you haven't been here yet, now would definitely be the time to give it a go.

Having heard so much about this place and not having been here even once, I was determined to come here this time round while I was visiting the city! My parents had been here twice the week before and were unavailable to get a table even after having waited for half an hour. So finally getting a table on their third try also raised their level of expectations. This is also one of those age old restaurants on Park Street with its old world charm and yummy food (supposedly). Since we were in the mood for a quick dinner we decided to order a portion of Fish Tikka, Fried Fish with Tartare Sauce and two portions of the Chelo Kababs (this place is known for them). The Fish Tikka came first and was so delicious that it kind of raised our expectations about the rest of the meal even higher! We got the Fried Fish next and from the look of it itself we figured there was something off. The crumb coating was more like a layer above the fish and made it seem more like a fish pakoda. The boiled vegetables that accompanied it also looked stale. The Chelo Kababs took a little longer to come. It is essentially a portion of chicken and mutton kababs served with some buttered rice and a fried egg. Our kababs were cold when we got them and the meat was hard and dry and flavours barely there. Even having them along with the rice didn't do anything to it as the rice was also dry. I honestly don't get the hype about this particular dish or even the place as a whole as after waiting for more than half an hour (along with all the amazing reviews) we atleast expected a decent meal. I was thoroughly disappointed and my parents more so as they had been so eager to get me here. Maybe it was just our luck we had this bad experience but I doubt we're going to come here again!

Delicacies of Kolkata is incomplete without Peter Cat, situated at the heart of Gourmet (Park) Street. I have been to the place few times but let's discuss about my most recent rendezvous on 13th May, 2015. As usual let me divide this review in 2 parts.

Pros:
1. The food is delicious to say the least. I had the famous chelow kebab and brownie with vanilla ice cream in hot chocolate sauce. There is only one word for the food items: Bellissimo. The cooking is so damn good.

2. For a restaurant of this stature has some best behaved stuffs. The service is really good.

3. The amount of chocolate sauce requires special mention. It tastes like heaven.

4. The ambience is super awesome. The cozy corners give you an elegant feeling.

Cons:

1. The long queue still irritates me. Though it signifies the place's popularity.

2. The price tags are quite on the higher side. They have increased the price by 15%+ since my last visit.

3. The food amount has decreased significantly. Probably the rice part of chelow has been minimised to cut cost.

My Rating: 4/5

At a very young age I read somewhere that Suchitra Sen used to come at Peter Cat for the mouth watering chelo kabab n sizzlers. When first time I visited there I found the ambience of old 70s n traditionally dressed up waitresses. Now the food is no doubt delicious ( spclly chelo kabab n sizzler) but you have to wait a bit. The staff behaviour is not that modest I have xptd.

I visited this place when i was in my school days.. Atlast after so many years i got a chance  to visit this place again with my friend. We ordered pineapple juice chelo kabab and chicken marakesh and tuti frooti.. The food was tasty and and i have no complains regarding the taste or preparation. Pineapple juice made us feel better in this hot and sultry afternoon. But one thing which made me surprised was the behaviour of the waiter.. They were creating a situation as if we have to finish the food very quickly.. To eat and cherish the food is always my hobby but i really noticed that they were making us to eat quickly and finish the plates and pay the bill. Both my friend and i was really surprised to see this type of hospitality. This made me little sad disappointed me as well. But for the love of the food and also the taste of tuti frooti and also the decor which made me to ignore this situation at that point of time and made me and my friend to cool down.. I will surely love to visit this place again and hope at least that time the waiter will give me some little time to cherish the food and eat it with full of enjoyment.. For food my rating will be 4.3 out of five, for decor 4.5 and for service 3. Hope so the management take some steps regarding the hospitality.

There isn't much to write about this restaurant. It's one of those legendary restaurants in Calcutta.
If you go here, try the sizzlers without a doubt. Good in taste, good in quantity and most importantly the prices are very reasonable. Try the chelo kababs.
Only improvement that can be suggested is in terms of the service. Waiters seem to be lost in their own world.

this place is considered to be one of the most prestigious restaurants of the city and rightly so. Nostalgia sweeps me as I write this review as this was one of the first restaurants i had been to as a kid. I feel really very glad to say that this place still has not lost its charm and still everybody including me love this place just the same inspite of various new fancy dine ins emerging in Park street! Well its definitely for the food as well as the classy ambience this place has. The staff here are very courteous and homely and thats very important for the success of a place.
The food item which strikes our mind as we utter Peter Cat is what? The chello kabab!!!! And rightly so !! Its the best I have tasted! This one is a must have for all. The rice is perfectly buttered... the kababs are yummy and it melts in the mouth... the veggies are well cooked and it is awesomeness served prettily in a plate...:) The sizzlers here are worth mentioning too and so are the cocktails. This place is nice with great food and great drinks to sip on and its easy on the pocket too :)

One of the city favourites, this place has gone down a bit with time. Their menu remains the same, while the food isn't as great as it was, even 7 or 8 years ago when I used to go there as a kid. The quantity is less, the ambiance isn't as classy as it used to be, the place runs mostly on it's brand and the fact that most people are driven to it's tables by a sheer sense of nostalgia.¬†The chelo kebab is the one reason to keep on visiting this place, as well as it's famous sizzlers. They have reduced the quantity, and increased the price but it's still as great as it used to be. The sizzlers, however, are not as great as you would expect them. Fish sizzlers should come as a surprise for those who don't set much store by fish anyway.¬†If you want that 70s feel, and can't resist the urge to tuck into that chelo kebab once more, you should definitely hop by.

Sayz...have heard a lot about this place and finally had the chance to visit it. It is situated in a very decent location at park street. As usual there was quite a queue but was lucky to get the seat in 10 minutes. Food is good but not excellent. I tried one peshwari kebab, but it was not upto the mark. I also tried chelo kebab which is one of the most popular dish in peter cat. It was good to me but I was expecting it a lot better as I have heard a lot about it. Finally I tried nan n afghani chicken n believe me it was awsome. I also ordered one brownie with vanilla ice cream n chocolate cream, it was quite delicious. The ambience was superb n the staff members were good.

Had a nice experience following this recommendation of many of my friends, though the famous Chelo Kebab didn't make my stomach as much satisfied as the Chicken Steak Sizzler did. Will be definitely coming here on further occasions. Good ambience and a well-served place to drop by along with your friends/family.

Peter Cat has always been one of my favourite restaurants. I went there for lunch today with my family after quite a few days. The ambience was good. We ordered 2 Chelo Kababs and 1 sizzler i.e Tandoori Mixed Grill. While the Chelo Kababs were good as usual, the Tandoori Mixed Grill was not so good. For a dish they "passionately recommend", it should have been better. Overlooking this one time disappointment, Peter Cat remains one of the few must visit places.

I have never had too much respect for this place but owing to the fact that it has been been in businrss for a very long time, I will show the courtesy of saying the good things first. Peter cat has a good ambience but that's about it; its food is highly overrated, not price wise but in popularity, although I personally vouch for the dum ki raan and would also pay some notice to the chello kebabs. It has been able to popularly project its sizzlers but again I am not a huge fan of sizzlers. Particularly in my last visit I found the mutto hamburger steak exceptionally tasteless. I would not recommend this place to people who understand food.

Been there in a summer afternoon with my friend. One of the elite restaurants of Park Street area. Ordered two Chelo Kebabs and Peter Cat's Special dessert and Bachelor's Desire only. Enough for two people if both are not voracious eaters. Service was prompt and the people were courteous. Chicken was soft and tasty, mutton was well cooked and the drink was exquisite. :)

Was lucky to get in today without the long queue ! Excellent ambiance and the food is classic! Tried their signature Chello Kebab; it's a royal pleasure that you get when you take a seat on those comfy red sofas and the hanging lampshade gives you the 70's-cinema-feel! The costume of the stewards complete the magical experience.

The only thing I don't like about Peter Cat is the waiting before getting into the restaurant.
This place has a fusion of many origins.
It has a British type ceiling and carpets and the waiters wears Persian dresses.

The lighting is Chinese and sets up the mood very well.
The chelos are the main searched eatery here.

I came here a couple of times. But this time it was a disappointment.
We have ordered Chicken sizzler and Chicken irani kebab. It took almost half an hour to get the food on the table........ and they served wrong items. We have to change our orders later to get the food faster.
It can not be expected from Peter Cat. 

Nothing new to say about this place.....The remaining is ok.
Somehow I feel that they are charging a bit high for their foods (quantity wise).

I love this place! Yes for its chelo kebab. Its an evergreen dish though now many restros have come up with this dish, but the one we get at Peter Cat is excellent. More so because nostalgia is attached to it. Lovely food, lovely ambiance, lovely kebabs teamed with bloody marry or just a sip of coke, its wonderful!
            
And then apart from the chelo, this time we tasted the other dishes too which are the signature dishes - Dumm ki rann, the various sizzlers like chicken steak, fish meuniere, grilled fish, mixed grill etc. I keep going back to this place with my friends or family and have never been disappointed, am sure nobody has ever been disappointed. And therefore, my rating remains same :)

I've been to this place many a times and was very disappointed with the quality or quantity. They have always managed to live up to my expectation. Though I am a die heart chelo kabaab lover but I would suggest the Peter Cat visitors to focus on other dishes of the menu card too. Chelo kabaab is now an old cliche.

Peter Cat prepares wonderful sizzlers. The various fish items in the sizzlers are always lip smacking.  For cold coffee lovers like me, this is one of the best place offering cold chicken salad too.  Do try out the mocktails here.

The ambience is pretty good and service is satisfactory.

Do visit. :)

The only perfect destination for Chelo Kebab. A touch of past with the traditional dress of the staffs and the ambiance peter cat welcomes both the then and today's generation. If you are a kebab fan then at least put your step here once and munch on the foods, or else you will definitely miss something big. Other dishes are worth too but I wish I could remember their names which I had tried different times. Good ambiance with good and polite service. I have never seen this place vacant at any time of the day, it means you should be keep patience and stand in the queue and wait for your turn to pamper your taste buds. :) :) Its a must go place for every Kolkatan to eat and enjoy, after all food is life... :) :D

I hate to disagree with the crowd. One upon a time, Peter Cat, the best has now gone below its own standards...... Sitting among Kolkata's finest. The service quality and the ambience live up to reputation as stated by my fellow friends. But is the food the same? Can't anyone tell the slightest difference? Me and my family, had the orthodox cello kebab and sizzlers. Sounded good...... But were on the heavier and much more than normal spicy side. Variety of kebabs in the platter have decreased. Only the food has downgraded a teeny weeny bit..... But there is no reason to doubt dis place. Lots of opportunity to improve, dats a plus...... I love dis place anyhow..... And will keep loving it the same way!;-)

This restaurant has been around for a while and i remember visiting even during school days. The decor of the place remains the same since i remember and there is an old world charm to it. 

Calcutta is famous for its choice of food and its taste and quality and Peter Cat lives up to this. The food is absolutely sumptuous. I am a great great great fan of the non- vegetarian chelo kabab !! I would absolutely recommend every non-vegetarian to try this out !!

Apart from this, the menu offers you a variety of other food items and drinks. The prices are extremely modest. 

If you happen to be in Calcutta, i would definitely recommend this one to you !

As suggested by a friend I visited this restaurant......the location could not be better than this for any outlet.
After 45 mins of wait we got the table, the interior and ambiance was very good.
My friend was very impressed with the beer glass.
We ordered the famous chello kebab, tandoori chicken, brain curry, chicken liver masala....all the food was better than what we have heard, all the spice was well balanced. 
Though food was good ...but Senior service staff was way rude..... Its just because of the business they have.
But for good satisfying food one should visit this restaurant !!!!!

Customers Wait to get a Table.

We had our names listed for a table at 8:15 pm on 1st May 2015. We were told it would be 35 to 40 minutes before we were "admitted". At 9 pm when we inquired, we were first told that "Sorry, it would be another 30 to 45 minutes - and no we cannot assure you the time". When we raised an issue stating why did they not tell us before - The "Gatekeeper and Manager" argued that first of all "He has no evidence that we registered our Name at 8:15 pm" and defended their "Policy" that Customers have to wait till there is place - They cannot assure when guests will be admitted and that is how they have been running this restaurant and it has made them "Famous and Sought After". Soon, other waiting guests expressed their anguish including some who had been waiting for 2 hours after being told 30 minutes. 

The restaurant "supposedly" believes that is this "Long Wait" that enhances their "Imagery" and "Desirability" as "The Forbidden Apple" for Adam.

Wonder if this is the age for such Arrogance!!!

The dining area is dimly lit so one wonders what one eats.

Undoubtedly¬† one of the star player in Kolkata Cullinary Map,Peter Cat has been satiating the taste buds of Kolkata foodies for decades..Nothing much to speak about this place,since it is supremely popular..ever since my childhood whenever we used to visit park street this was our automotic first choice unless otherwise..The only and biggest Con is surely the long queues that u have to experience whenever u visit this place..also their watchman seemed to be a bit rude to the waiting diners..
Although this place is known for its Chelo Kebab and it has become quite cliche I would highly recommend venturing into some lesser known dishes on their menu:
Cold Chicken Salad: Just loved the seasoning..nice mild flavours..
Shikar: This is one of the best mutton kebab I have ever tasted..soft,juicy tender mutton boti,loved the smokiness of the dish..
Chicken Marakesh: A nice alternative to Chelo Kebab..Inspired from moroccan cuisine..love the kebab and the quality of rice..
Nawabi: Another of their signature mutton delicacy..Loved the spicy and tangy flavours..it is a bit sour which adds to the taste..Highly Recommended..
Tanddori Mixed Grill: Loved the prawns in the sizzler..sufficient portion for two to share..served with bread rolls..
Chocolate Nut Sundae: Though I have tasted thousands of different Deserts and Ice Creams in various places,this always remain one of my favourite sundae..dinners in Peter Cat can never end without this..something seems to never change..
Overall dining at Peter Cat is an expereince,a tryst with the forgotten times..nostalgia at its very best..

The above sentence best describes how I feel about Peter Cat. No doubt that the place is a legend in itself, but the times I have been here, all I have been is disappointed. Their signature dish is the Chelo kabab, but, sorry to say, its no where as perfect as they would like it to be. The interior is quite nice. The food is ok.¬†
I hope it regains its former glory and treats us to mouth watering delicacies for years to come.

This is one of my favourite reastaurants in the city. And for me, it reserves a special place in my heart due to many reasons. I have made many memories over here. I have been going there since my childhood. The decor, ambience, the staffs - everything and everyone in Peter Cat are very special to me. As soon as you enter, you have to take your mind in the sixties where you have to settle yourself amidst a classy yet chic ambience. I prefer the sitting arrangement for two by the side of the entrance which gives me a feeling of dining in an European style. Well, now comes the most important thing, that is FOOD! I just love everything I have here. The prawn cocktail gives a soothing cooling effect in your tongue appetizing your body for the next surprises coming up. I often get confused about what to order for the main course. The House Special Sizzler, Bhetki Meuniere and their very much celebrated Chello Kebab are my all time favourites. You have to choose one to eat in one meal because all of them are pretty heavy. That feeling of the butter melting in your mouth and the fried egg waiting to be gobbled up is just next to be on cloud 9. Yes, I am this much obsessed about everything in Peter Cat. For those, who haven't yet been there and are judging the restaurant by this review, I plead to you, the next thing you should do after reading this is head to Peter Cat and try their delicacies, all of them, if possible. Happy Dining! :)

You know they serve something worthwhile when you have to wait in the line for about 40 mins to enter the restaurant.
Chelo Kebab first caught my fantasy when Wikipedia told me that it's Iran's national food. Also, the fact that I had never tried Mutton before. And I was awed by the beautiful portion I was served, Butter Rice & Grilled Tomatoes on it's side, Egg Yolk on the top, accompanied with Mutton & Chicken kebab.
Peter Cat's Chelo Kebab is Christmas on a plate.

Peter cat is well known all over kolkata for its chello kabab and sizzlers. But i found nothing great about their food. Its their name and fame by which they run. Also, i dont know why zomato dint upload prices in their menu cards. So i have uploaded few pics of their menu card along with their prices.

Location- From park street metro, walk upto the crossing near flurys. Then take the lane to your right and there lies peter cat beside au bon pain.

I had to wait for nearly half an hour to get my seat. Since it was my first time to peter cat, i dint knew that i had to write my name. So my waiting time got extended.

Ambience- The interior was dark and well decorated with lamps.

Food and service- We ordered
1. Tandoor mixed grill sizzler - It had a piece of chicken, one small piece of fish, prawn and paneer, one half egg, one seekh kabab and three pieces of chicken liver. Every item was provided in a small amount just the chicken liver was given in a huge quantity which i dint like to eat. I was quite annoyed at this. But the sizzler tasted good.

2. Chello kabab - I was happy to have ordered this. Five pieces of lip-smacking chicken kabab, two mutton seekh kabab and rice with butter and omlet. It was nice.

Coming to the service, i had to wait for 15 mins before my order was taken and then it was served in not before 20 mins. I was hungry and disappointed. Also i was diasappointed seeing three pieces of chicken liver in the sizzler where the other items were served in less quantity.
At the billing time, when i gave the waiter a tip of 20rs, he was still staring at us. I dint know the reason behind such an idiotic behaviour. How much more do you expect in a tip from students? Since he was an old man, i did not say him anything but i suggest him to learn some courtesy. I think 3.0 rating is something more that i have given them after today's experience !! I wont recommend this place to anybody and neithr am i ever going there !

Nothing to say about Peter cat ?. My favorite one in park street. The best dishes are prawn cocktail, cream of chicken soup, chicken mayonnaise, chello kabab and my personal fav is the mixed grill sizzler or just the chicken which ever is available

Well not my first time and definitely not the last time as well. Have been coming here with my dad since I was a child and The Chicken Steak Sizzler has been my all time favourite. The place has got the perfect old Calcutta charm,with the office goers enjoying their lunch with their clients, people giving birthday treat to their friends and parents bringing their children for Sizzler and Chello Kabab. 
            For so long I have been a Sizzler fan but after trying the Chello Kabab quite reluctantly actually, I loved it as well. Well,if you're going to Peter Cat then hands down Sizzler is the best thing to have but Chello Kabab is at par with it as well.

Best place in the city to have Chelo Kebab and Sizzlers. Heard a lot about how amazing this place is. Got a chance to try this place out and here is my review. This place is always filled with people. Que of people eagerly waiting to get a table, including me. Finally got a table. Really lovely place i must admit, great ambiance, the aroma of butter and Kebab makes you famish. We sat for a while until we got attended by someone, and my first impression was not that good they weren't polite especially the waiters. We ordered Grilled fish, Chicken steak sizzler and a couple of Chelo Kebabs. Food took its own sweet time to arrive at our table. The Grilled fish and The Chicken steak sizzler was absolutely spot on. Cooked to perfection and had an amazing flavor. Then we were given the legendary Chelo Kebab, and I'm sorry to burst the bubble here it is an over hyped dish. The Rice was cooked perfectly so were the Chicken malai kebab or the white kebab that they give. Problem was the Egg and the Mutton shekh kebab, The yolk was suppose ooze out when you cut it, but it was over cooked so half of the yolk was still in its liquid form and half was solid. Then the Mutton shekh kebab, It had no prominent flavor and it was over cooked and dry. Left a really bad taste.
Still it is very good restaurant and it is recommended for those who haven't had a taste of Peter Cat. It is my personal opinion, I guess they have gotten sloppy and carefree over the year.

Also the Hyderabadi biryani was very yummy.. Though I hvnt tried the sizzlers , BT have heard they are splendid as well.. Should visit once at least...

One of the best places to treat yourself..along with the famous dish of chelo kebab which i doubt any other place in this world can do justice to, the house special consisting of chicken steak, sausages and liver is mouthwatering. I would also like to add that the cocktail called bachelor's desire is just amaaazing with the slight hint of rum along with pineapple juice....

Wow I loved everything about it . The ambience is wonderful kinda romantic. Though I was bit annoyed with the service they forgot my cocktail ? at first. Apart from that good service. Now coming to food. We ordered prawn cocktail, chicken steak which was house special. Peter cat's famous chelo kaba grilled bekti and two cocktails strawberry and pineapple blossoms. The food were awesome. Prawn cocktail was a real surprise. I like grilled bekti the most. It was so tasty and the garnishes they used in every food was so nice.

I mainly go to peter cat for their superb sizzlers. It is the only place in calcutta who's sizzlers are exactly as sizzlers are supposed to be. No frills. Just superb taste and fresh ingredients. Other than sizzlers, their famous chello kebab platter is a must try. This place is always packed on weekends and occasions. Make sure you reach with time in hand. :)

This place is overrated. Period. 

I went only to try their much talked about Chelo Kebab. I did, along with two other dishes. The Chelo Kebab itself was pretty average. A dessert called Fruit Cup was horrible. I couldn't take more than two sips. The ambience is nice. Pricey and average. Less variety of food. Not a good option in the area since you have Bar-B-Q just a few meters away.

this place was suggested by my bong friends as soon as they knew my posting was in kolkata. ¬†As soon as i entered into this restaurant, i was surprised by the ambience. but as i went on to see the menu card, i was shocked. Highly priced items. Then we went to order some items, and we did not forget the "Chelo Kebab". Service is pretty slow. It took 40 Min for serving. But the wait and price are really worth, The taste is really awesome and had to order some more food as we lost the thought of judicious eating.¬†

Overall try this place only once and choose items carefully. GO in a group so as to reduce the blow to pocket.¬†
Must try place!!!!

Since childhood i am visiting this landmark restaurant. Words are not enough to describe how much i love this place. To be honest i am and will always be biased about Petercat. If you are first timer just close your eyes and order Chelo Kebab special . I do love their Marakesh and sizzlers. Among the starters you can go for Fish Makhmali ( my fav) and in dessert i always go for Tuti fruti ....childhood tastes die hard. Happy tasting .

Summary
Ambiance: 9
Food: 10
Value for money: 9
Service: 9
Location: 10
Opinion: Must visit.¬†

Ambiance: The place is buzzing with enthusiasm throughout the day. While that may mean long waiting queues, the feel inside is reminiscent of Kolkata during its hay days. It attracts crowd of all age groups alike and is an ideal setting for friendly brunches and casual meetings. For people with family who prefer calmer surroundings, there is a separate section upstairs. However, For people unaware of the heritage value of this place, they have to wait for the food to be able to appreciate the hype.¬†

Food: the best part about Peter Cat is its amazing kebabs and sizzlers. Kolkata is often accused of being partial towards non vegetarians but Peter Cat is an exception. Both the veg and non veg Chelo kebab is mouth wateringly amazing. The gastronomical orgasm can be experienced in the sizzlers and kebabs as well!

Value for money: Every penny spent here is worth it. However, the decor might not be very sophisticated as mentioned before.¬†

Service: Due to the huge rush throughout the day service might be a tad slow. But the waiters are very friendly and willing to help out the uninformed and confused visitor.

Location: Located bang in the middle of Kolkata's most happening street, reaching Peter Cat is no rocket science. Take the right turn from Flurys and you're there. However, finding a suitable parking location might be a problem. Try the multi-level car park at a distance in case you're unable to find one. Be warned, the parking rates are quite steep.¬†

This place is frequented by the glitterati and is one of the most famous places in the city. Don't get disheartened by the long queues. It is worth it :-)

When it comes to Peter Cat food is always good... But however over the time their quality of service has gone down... The gaps in between starter and main course was like forever.. Though our order was pretty simple nothing fancy... People serving were too slow.. Didn't respond to u when u ask for anything..  Coming back to good kebabs were good.... Dal fry and reshmi chicken masala was good.. Had a tough time with the tandoori roti..... NEVER order a tuti fruity ice cream... It's horrible... Though brownies with hot chocolate and ice cream was good.... Over all good but will only b back for their delicious chello kebab platter..

Its hard to get a table at Peter Cat these days. We had to wait almost 45 mins but the wait was worthwhile when the food arrived.  We kept it simple and ordered two House Special Chicken Sizzlers. It was delicious, slightly sweet and extremely filing. Something different than Chelo Kebab that's always ordered.

Peter cat, a name that has been in and around the foodies of Kolkata for quite a long time now it seems, probably one of the oldest and classiest name people in Kolkata had grown up hearing about. The one thing that instantly comes to mind upon hearing peter cat is the famous chello kebab, the quality of which I am afraid has degraded over he years. This place has now lost once its former glory. Located in one of the most classiest parts of the town, peter cat still has its charm. The decor is not something to catch the eye, the food quality is moderately good and the quantity is also good, particularly good for casual dining. The place is also not that much expensive considering the other restaurants located in the vicinity. The food takes a bit of time to arrive and it is usually very busy with large number of people always gushing in.

Peter Cat, a quaint name at best and definately not one that conjures images of the gastronomical delights that are served inside.

I generally do not order starters but at times I will allow myself a soup ( a cream of tomato with a liberal dash of black pepper) or the chicken cocktail sausages.¬†

For the mains it is generally the Chello Kebab, which is why I think Zomato has placed this particular restaurant under the legendary category. The taste and quality are consistent. However ........

My absolute favourite at Peter Cat is this Veg Sizzler that they have ( don't know the exact name of the dish) but amongst the many fine vegetables present in this dish is a tomato that is stuffed with paneer, which transforms a good veg sizzler to an amazing veg sizzler. At this point I would like to point out that I am a die hard meat-a-holic but it is dishes such as this ( along with my moms Dhokar Torkari, Paporer Dalna) and a few such selected items that do at times manage to lure my inner herbivore out for a fine feast.

Dessert is usually the brownie with ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce.

The decor is ok-ish( nothing to write home about) and the service is ok-ish too, the waiters generally don't have time to chit chat as due to the popularity of this place there is always a queue, which brings me to my last point getting a table here can be an exhausting experience, but on a positive note it'll make you all the hungrier when you do finally make it it.

After all what are legendary restaurants without legendary queues.

All roads lead to Peter Cat. Well, at least Park Street does. Been there so many times but was never disappointed. Liked the Chelo Kabab first few times but once they raised the prices, it was no longer that attractive. But their sizzlers are simply the best in town. Awesome mix, perfectly done....they are a must try.

Peter Cat gives Kolkatans yet another reason to feel proud about this city. They just don‚Äôt make so good Chelo Kebabs anywhere else! Before you walk-in to this place make sure you have around half-an-hour extra time with you ‚Äòcoz you need to queue up before you get a place. This is more or less the same around all days of the week. The dim-lit restaurant has a perfect ambience to lift up your mood and the smell of sizzlers being served all around you just surges your appetite to the next level. Enough said about their chelos and sizzlers let me suggest to you something more- don‚Äôt leave the place without trying their dessert ‚Äúchoconut sundae‚Äù like they put it PASSIONATELY RECOMMENDED!!

Went with old school friends, and had a gala time catching up over their signature dish, the Chello Kebab - Two long, tender pieces of mutton ¬†kebabs, a plateful of well-cooked rice topped with melting cubes of butter, a poached egg and chunky pieces of skewered, char-grilled chicken cubes, tomatoes and capsicum. all washed down with chilled Fresh Lime Sodas. We chatted and ate and chatted some more and ate some more till we were full to the brim, very content, very happy. ¬†Truly wonderful experience. Highly recommended.

Looking for a place to have a fine dining experience? Look no further than Peter Cat. Amazing ambience with a great array of delicacies. Like all other restaurants located in Park Street this one's also a little expensive. But believe me, it's worth it.

A must try is the Chelo Kabab. Only thing that's not so good about this place is the tremendous queue. But good things happen to those who wait.

Today finally got a chance to enter peter cat after waiting for 10 mins. The ambience is cool. We ordered prawn cocktail which was really a surprise but it was@ good...different but quite good. Then we had to have the famous chello kebab. We also ordered grilled bhekty and chicken sizzler... The fish was really good. As for the sizzler i liked the sausages but not the liver portion... And as for drinks we ordered pineapple blossom and strawberry blossom... Both quite refreshing...allover it was a fulfilling meal and as for the hype about peter cat, i must say it didnt disappoint.

Lovely food - sizzlers are amazing- try Chelo Kabab!

Always busy - the young love this place and the veterans don't give up on it!

Sorry for writing the review a bit late ;-)
On occasion of Christmas last year, we had gone to park street on the night of 24th December.  We decided to go to Peter Cat for dinner.  Once we reached at around 9 pm, saw a huge crowd and gathering waiting for their turn to go inside. But we were determined to have dinner there since it was our first time. And after a long wait of more than 90 mins, we finally got the chance to go inside. Ambience was quite good and waiters were quite helpful and well mannered. Just felt the space a little cramped to accomodate more people there. We ordered the famous chelo kabab and some juices alongwith it. Chelo kabab was really awesome and was really happy with the taste. Was worth the long wait. Looking forward to visit again and try the sizzlers there :-)

It was a disappointment visiting this joint after ages. If the owner reads this let me spell out the things that are missing. 

No doubt you are old and a heritage to the city, but it's time evolve as the customer expectations have changed over the period of time. 

Staff - stuck up, no smiles and shabby dressing surely irany fashion has improved and hence the dresses can be improved. A smile won't kill or cost

Entry experience- the guy at the gate has no smile, there is waiting but no waiting area, current area does not even offer seating 

Food - losing its touch ordered for House Special Steak sizzler, was sad. Nothing reflecting of the house for sure. Tandori Mixed sizzler - too much gravy and sad combination. Chelo Kebab - quality has gone down

Bar - ordered a drink and requested for a glass change, was refused for that stating this is the only glass for a cocktail can't give a whiskey tumbler. 

Payment - still running old credit card machines.

Dude you are a heritage don't let cheap food become a reason to dine at the joint.

When it comes to Peter cat, it's always Chelo Kabab...The platter full of mouth watering delicacy is what draws me to this restaurant...It was only once that I had been to this awesome place and I am already planning to pay a second visit to savour the taste of the smoky sizzler, which the place also boasts of. I've also had the Chocolate Nut Sundae as dessert, but wasn't much satisfied with it, as it had a fruity middle layer, which didn't blend well with the top and bottom Choco nutty layers.
Speaking of the ambience, it was superior. The staff were extremely courteous and watchful. All in all,it was a pleasant dining experience at Peter Cat.

This is one of the best place to dine if any one looking for a north Indian cuisine. The famous dish is Chelo kebab!! Every time I was there I ordered for it. 
The whole ambience is pretty good, also the service is good. Though it seemed that they were little late for 6 plate of chelo kebab, that can be ignored. 
Price may look a little high but with the quality of the food it is good. The non veg chelo is Rs. 390 and veg chelo is Rs. 344 (both including tax).

No comments about the food as the whole city knows about it's taste. But plz plz plz do something about the siting capacity as getting a place to sit without troubling your legs is mission impossible.

A favorite location for me and ma's date...near my ma's school..the place holds a lots of memories for her too...whenever me my friends are out with my mum we often these place...The 'Chelo Kabab' is just so so so good.. and the sizzler served with such amazing sizzle that it excites u ...every-time we r there we first opt for 'Chelo kabab' ¬†without any 2nd thought ..then even if our tummy is full we would still order for chicken steak..that's not done if u r gone without the sizzle from here and also the brownie ice cream with the hot chocolate ...:-) :-)

Its the best place for sizzlers. The amazing sizzlers & chelo kebabs attract me always. Keep up the taste of sizzlers. But peter cat should increase their restaurant space. Its very clumsy

With the turbaned waiters in their white uniforms, the dimly lit interiors and the low hanging lamps that seem to privately light up your table, Peter Cat takes us back in time. I visited it with my parents this Easter, to try out some of the most renowned dishes of this legendary restaurant.¬†

Beckty Meunier - Yes, that is how the fish is spelled on the menu, in the old Anglo-Indian style, I presume. The fish was flaky and tender, and the parsley butter sauce brought out the flavour of the fish even better. It was served with a side of spiced potatoes, which provided a tangy contrast to the mild fish, and some steamed carrots and french beans. Altogether, the dish works really well, and it was a lovely way to start the meal.

Chicken Steak Sizzler - Peter Cat is known for its sizzlers, and I was determined to try it. However, although the hissing, steaming platter impressed at first sight, it failed to deliver on flavour. The sauce had a strong taste with not much depth.

Chelo Kabab - One simply does not visit Peter Cat for the first time and not try the Chelo Kabab, and the first spoonful was enough to make me realise why this seemingly dry plate of rice and skewered meats was so sought after. The rice, smothered in butter and delicately flavoured with cardamom and tiny bits of green, was divine. Surprisingly, the kababs, the perfectly cooked egg and the salad then seem like an added luxury. A complete and perfect dish to say the least.

Meringue with Vanilla Ice Cream and Hot Chocolate Sauce - Good, but not brilliant. The cold ice cream contrasted well with the rich, hot chocolate sauce, but the meringue had gone a bit soggy and chewy, thus depriving the dish of the crunch it needed.¬†

Overall, the experience was quite good. The Chelo Kabab was certainly the standout course of the meal, it is worth coming back for, time and time again.

Wooed by every bit of this place. The ambience, the treatment and most of all the food. If you are in Kolkata it is incomplete without the food from here. Tried chelo kebabs and house special sizzler along with red wine, it was served with great acceptance and on top if it the food quantity and quality was tremendous. I was really happy with everything thing here..do check out the liquor menu even if you don't booze its funny

‚òÜGood Hygiene level.
‚òÜFood is mouth-watering.
‚òÜChelo kebab is must-eat.
‚òÜSoup is the tastiest of all starters.
‚òÜTakes too much of time to get a table but after the wait is over and when you start to eat there,there's no way you will consider this wait as a waste of time.

One Disadvantage is that tables are little too closer.It is not a family hotel for sure.The most important is that how it looks from inside.The first thing that impresses a Critics is the decor where Peter Cat lag behind.

First there was food then there was Peter Cat. A restaurant with the park street aroma all over, a place which no review can justify. The a-la-carte provides numerous opportunities to brew one's taste buds but the restro excels in its Indian offerings. The tandoor grill should be any food lover's paradise. On the flipper side lies the beating the queue experience & an overhyped chelo kebab

What more to say about this place. Its almost anonymous with Sizzlers and Chelo Kebab and rightly so. You might have to wait for a table on weekends coz it lures a lot of people from around. If you ever go to the place please dont miss out on the wide range of Sizzlers and the Chelo Kebab. Also you can add one of the many drinks they have to offer. The ambience is outstanding and altogether adds up to the awesomeness of this place. So head out and taste. Pocket punch would be 800-1000 for 2.

This is one place that will never get old.. I have been going there for years, but the ambience, the crowd, the peoples everything is still the same.. They provide varieties of sizzlers and each one of them is amazingly good with exact proportions :) A lot of people prefer their chelo kabab, it is not one of my favourite and often I found the kababs to be a little dry, but still its better than many other places.. Even their desserts are pretty good.. Souffl√©, caramel custard.. All are yum!!

Another of my all-time favourite restaurants in Park street. Peter Cat = Romantic rendezvous+ lovely red wine+ dreamy ambience+ awesome food. I remember the 'melt-in-your-mouth' taste of the 'cold buffet' here, which I had a few years back, when I visited it for the first time. My favourites: Chicken mayonaisse and Cold chicken with salad.

Peter Cat is one of the most renowned Restaurants in Kolkata, there would be no such Foodie in Kolkata who hasn't had a good chunk of this restaurant. Chelo Kabab is probably the best item on the Menu. And I would suggest it even at gunpoint. I take away one star because I feel some of the dishes have an extra taste of Spices but then that is personal choice.

Another of those restaurants in Park Street which serves the taste buds to the fullest. Comes right from the old school park street restos, with an incredible ambiance and courteous staff, you would love spending every second here. The dimly lit ambiance adds to the flavor of the place. The food is more than decent here, the place is hugely famous for its chello kababs, however i personally prefer ordering the dum ki raan which a lamb dish preparation, the meat just seems to melt in your mouth. Alcohol is decently priced, so if you are willing to visit this place over a Saturday night, make sure your wallet is decently decked up and ofcourse make sure you have got yourself a reservation. The place is crowded at the fullest. Definitely a place to visit here in Kolkata, with family, friends or girl friend, what ever suits you but do make a visit.

Cheers !! Happy Munchin :)

Known for its chelo kabab (which happens to be my personal favourite as well)  and sumptuous steaks, this is one place that has never disappointed me no matter when I had visited. The service and the food quality should get 4.5/5. I would recommend anybody coming to kolkata or a resident of kolkata to visit this place atleast once (if not more) just to taste its steak and the chelo kabab. It's one of the best in Kolkata and trust me, you would not be disappointed. The only minus point is that it doesnt book tables from before hand but if you ask me, why not wait a bit in queue just to taste the best!!!! The ambience is also good , perfect for both frends and family gatherings!!! THUMBS UP to Peter Cat management for retaining the quality and making it even better each time you visit!!

You have to have money to visit this place, but once you are ready to shell out some amount of money, this place can serve you the best food you have had in your life. I suggest you go for the Original Chello Kebab and one of the Chicken Sizzlers.
This place gets full marks for ambience. The waiters are dressed like pathans (although many of them are short) and the lighting is awesome. A must visit place in Kolkata.

I can see they acted on the customer complaints. I have tandoori ckn for the 1st tym here.it was lovely. Had a little different taste than other good food joints.had rogon josh which was an big disappointment. It has the smallest meatless 3 lcs of mutton any one can ever imagine.I'm rating it down for this.we expect at least sufficient amount of food for one when we order a plate.

If you are looking out for peter cat on park street ,its quite easy as you will notice a long queue of hungry people huffing and puffing to get a table outside a white building.
Peter cat not only attracts people for their legendary Chelo Kebabs and Afghani chicken but also for the royal ambience with dim lighting and tall pathan waiters serving food.
Now coming to the food the Chelo Kebab in itself is a complete meal as you get around five pieces of chicken kebabs blended with persian herbs and mutton sheek kebab served on buttered rice and a poached egg which makes a heavenly combination and melts in your mouth.If you want to go for something else Aghan chicken is a must try and also Chicken tikka butter masala.
Every item in this restaurant is perfectly priced and so is the service and quality,this is why so many people visit this restaurant everyday.

I visited Peter cat for lunch last week. Though it looked like we'll have to wait a lot to get a table, but, we were lucky because, there was a vacant five-seater. When you enter Peter cat, it's dim lights and '70s decor will definitely catch your attention. In spite of the rush, the service is quick and the staff is friendly. Moving to the food, which of course is the main charm, is just perfectly cooked and presented. We had chelo kebabs, chicken sizzlers and fresh lime soda. This is an ideal place for a fine-dining experience, if the drawbacks of car-parking and waiting for a table is overlooked(which wouldn't be very difficult, because, the food is going to cast a spell on you ;))

Had heard a lot about this place and it's legendary chelo kabab. So, while in the city, decided to give it a try.

The ambiance is very suave and has a shadowy feel to it. It adds to the whole secret(y) feeling that this place has portrayed. It adds to the charm of the place.

The service is par excellence and the people are very helpful and courteous. Extra help is offered at the drop of a hat.

The food is good. I didn't understand the hype over this "chelo kaba". Agreed that they were very succulent and the entire mashup was very savoury. But the kabab on its own was just great, nothing to go gaga over.

Ambiance - 4.5/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5

The rating is for the overall experience that I got out of the restaurant. The chelo kababs were ok, but overall, the food was great.

My favourite place. Just love it for its Irani kabab,nawabi, biriyani. But the place remind us of the Stephen House tragedy. My husband and myself could not go there ever since. We cherish the memories of the good times and food we enjoyed there .this is our favourite restaurant.

Well, if you ask about peter cat to people staying in Calcutta and who happens to be connoisseurs, you won't need to read reviews before going to peter cat.
Despite being such an old establishment, peter cat maintained it's food quality and service quality. Ambience is nice.
Chello Kebabs and tiger prawns are must to order here.

In childhood may be, I have been here several times, memory of which has become fade enough not to make any impact on this review. Post childhood, I had heard of this place and its signature dish 'chelo kababs' several time from many sources. On the Christmas Eve of 2013, I had a visit to this restaurant around 2:30 PM. As expected, there was a huge queue. I wrote my name and they told there was no chance before 4 PM. I roamed around and came back at 4 PM. I came to know, my name was called already and since I was not there that time, I have to wait for the next appropriate vacancy. So did I with a fair expectation. After a while, the executive who was calling names went off and a new executive came and resumed calling with names. Some sense clicked in my mind and I approached that new guy asking about my turn. Surprisingly, he asked me to do a fresh entry of my name again since it was already called! It was already 4:45 PM. This is the first time I shouted with grievance in any restaurant. But it worked like magic almost immediately. We entered and got a table. I don't want to blame management for this as I know the rush that comes every year on this day is unreal and extremely difficult to manage. With the tremendous pressure that dances on the top of the heads of each and every staff of the restaurant, this minor mistakes may happen and should not be counted.
After sitting, the experience was nice. It is well decorated with a soothing ambiance. Staffs are dressed in gorgeous uniforms. We ordered chelo kababs and the delivery was quite fast. I loved the food, its presentation, taste, aroma, quality and quantity. The butter rice tasted awesome. The meats of the kababs were finely cooked and grilled to perfection; just melted in mouth. Though I felt the price to be a bit on the higher side. I came out with all the initial bad memories washed off and only a nice feeling of taste in my mouth and mind which persists even today. This place is truly and uniquely a legendary one in the city.

coming to the food, Peter cat is famous for its chelo kaba so we order those and also chicken irani kabab. the kabab was really good and the pieces were really tender. Chelo kabab was simply ¬†exquisite...!!!

My aunt took us here... Located in a prime area of park street..an ancient building it seems. It is very well known for chelo kababs. I loved them!! one plate was more than enough for me. It is dim inside bt u can see the food well due to the lights hanging from the ceiling focusing on the food on the table. A good value for money considering the fact that peter cat is a brand now..thanks to the wonderful chelo kababs.

In Park Street, Peter Cat is my favorite and visited there several times.My favorite which one should try out in starter is Tandoori Brocoli. Though there are several other starters but this one is the winner! And also Chelo kebab is their specialty and tastes superb.Mixed and chicken sizzlers are also Great...Overall it's a great place!

The ambience is okay but the food is heavenly. There is always a huge line outside this place and you might have to wait for 30-60 mins. But the wait is worth it.

An overall food delight. From starters to The Chelo Kebabs ...all were extraordinarily good. The chelo kebab needs no mention as it holds a place already as a speciality of the place. Amongst the desserts, peter cat's special was nice...but the american banana split didn't match the expectations.

Well, for this restaurant it is better if I write a second review after having food items other than Chelo and Sizzler, made myself to this outlet for 2 times and in both the times I had Chelo kabab and Sizzler, this is the only Chelo and Sizzler that I have tasted in my life. If this is how Chelo and Sizzler taste universally then it is not the fault of the restaurant but the item itself. I dont like the Chelo kabab (Rs 320+), because at home too I get the same rice with butter and yesss you have the option to buy this fine rice from Big Bazar outlets, and my mother has got that funda to make that fine smell to come out of the rice. Butter.....ohhh I don't think they give BMW butter. and mutton sticks you can have from popular Mughlai outlets which taste much better than the ones which are served with the dish, next comes the kebabs, hmmm....please visit Arsalan, Alibaba like food joints and have the Chicken Reshmi or Chicken Tikka Kebabs and you will never think of the kebab pieces that are served in Chelo.
Next is Sizzler (Rs 320+), being someone who has an enthusiastic interest in non veg and having tasted some really unique chicken and mutton dishes I really don't approve the taste of Sizzler, come on..... Chicken with boiled veggies like beans, tomatoes and cucumber plssss...and I don't get convinced just by the sound of the dish that it makes the moment it is placed hot on your table from the oven.
We also ordered fresh lime soda but it is too costly and at Rs 62 you can have wonderful lime soda drinks from some other shops, yes from standard restaurants.
Each time I have been to Park St, every time I have noticed a good crowd of food loving people in front of the joint. One needs to wait for a good amount of time before getting chance for a place inside. Now mostly people order the already mentioned items, for first timers I understand, myself being this genre in my time. But most follow it as a craze without giving a reason.
Finally, the atmosphere is good, waiters are so so, processing time.....time taking, this is due to the rush, a bit pricey...this much
Will have to taste other items in the menu to do a good judgement.

Peter Cat is one such eatery which holds a special place in most Kolkatans hearts. So 2 weeks back I visited this place after quite a long time to have dinner with my family. Visiting after such a long gap did not make me feel alien. The ambience, reception and service felt still the same. After a good 20mins wait, we got our entry into the restaurant. The orders comprised of Prawn cocktail, Grilled fish sizzler and our good old Chelo Kabab.

Prawn cocktail - It tasted good, the subtle sweet, salty, sour flavours with good texture, chilled temperatures and the prawn gave a soothing start.

Grilled Fish sizzler - In the beginning I was disappointed as the initial fizz associated with a sizzler was almost missing. Seemed to have been prepared in advance, so was not that sizzling hot. However, it tasted great. The fish was cooked to perfection, the sauce tasted delicious and the associated veggies tasted great too.

Non-veg chelo kabab - The combination of rice, butter, egg poach, chicken and mutton kabab along with salad is always heavenly. But this time chelo kabab did not taste up to the mark. The rice seemed to be undercooked and the smooth flavours seemed to be missing. So the experience was not that satisfying.

Overall, I can comment that the prime focus that I always had while visiting this place did not meet my expectation but I hope to get better experience the next time I visit this place.

This place is featured under "legendary" and legends needs no introduction or reviews! 

Their Chelo kebabs are one of a kind and I have never tasted something so perfectly delicious all my life! Their North Indian section comprising of chicken bharta, kebabs and breads are sumptuously delicious! Desserts are top notch and the vanilla with hot chocolate sauce is one of my favourites because they make the chocolate sauce from scratch- no Hershey's short cut here! 
The waiters are swift and efficient and most importantly courteous! I have been going here since I was 6 years old and I think I will be visiting this place even when I will be 60! 
Everyone in Kolkata knows about the famous chelo kebabs and the mouth watering sizzlers hence I won't waste my energy writing about a place which is already world famous in India or rather Calcutta! Haha 

Lately their portions in chelo kebab are getting a little smaller and prices are increasing but I guess when you have built a brand name you can always do these small things to make some extra profit!

Heard a lot about this place and about it's chelo kebab and sizzlers. Sizzler was very good, chelo kebab was also good but not as good as I expected it to be. The ambience is very nice, though I didn't like some parts of the decoration. Only problem is there is always a big line but they don't take much time in serving the food after you have ordered.

Peter Cat was always on my hit-list and ultimately last winter I landed up there twice after waiting in the queue of about 30 minutes each time. The interiors are very classy. We ordered all time favourite Chello Kabab and it was damn awesome. Cold Chicken Salad was also quite good but Chicken Sizzler was only average. The dishes are all well presented. Coming to dessert, we ordered tutti frutti which was quite mouth-watering. However, Service should have been much better and for only that aspect I am deducting .5 marks...anyway love to visit here again.

Peter Cat is a legendary Calcutta restaurant and One of the most gossiped places in Calcutta.
It is located just opposite site of KFC.
The interiors of these restuarant is mind blown,the dim lighting creates a nice mood.
we ordered Chicken Iran i Kebab(In Starters) ,Chelo Kebab(The Original One In main course) , and the Truity Fruity (In the Desert)Chicken irani kebab was Great, the chicken pieces are so juice and tender and chelo kebab was mouth watering and perfectly cocked and d last one the desert was nice.

Chelo Kebab from their menu is to die for. You feel lik you are in heaven when you ate gorging on the meat. And their hospitality management is flawless. Only flaw with Peter Cat? Availability. The line is too big on weekends as I've only visited then and getting a reservation looks like a Herculean task. But a line like that speaks for the treat you are in for once you are in. A must go,when you are in Kolkata!

The sizzlers here are a bit upsetting.. I mean why don't they saut√© the boiled side veggies?? Even the meat is too juicy, the kind where u feel it has been cooked with water.. I have only tried the sizzlers here coz it was so overrated by my colleagues.. Apart from that, getting a table there is time consuming. I feel the ambience is too dimly lit.. A little light can help one admire the dishes on the table. ?

There is nothing much to write about what Peter Cat represents to the food scene of Kolkata. Took my parents out for dinner on a weeknight. Wanted to book a table beforehand but that isn't an option at Peter Cat. We ended up sitting on its steps for 30 mins before we got a table. I really wish they at least have a waiting lounge rather than ask their customers to sit on steps.
The decor of the place is classy. Plush red chairs and seatees and nice hanging lights. We went for a prawn cocktail, a house special sizzler with bread rolls and a chello kebab for the starters and mains. The prawn cocktail was nice and creamy and cold. The sizzler wowed with its showmanship but I felt it lacked any depth of taste. The chello kebab was wonderful! Perfectly poached egg and beautiful kebabs but the rice in the dish was perhaps the most beautiful component. 
For the dessert we ordered a creme caramel and a peter cat special. The creme caramel was horrible! It is one of the worst dessert in a very long time. The caramel was watery and the custard was tasteless. The special was decent though. Lots of ice cream with fresh fruits, nuts and raisins.
The service is fast but the waiters have a problem serving the dishes. 
Overall a very nice place for a family dinnef but nothing mindblowing in it.

If you are the pioneer of "chelo kebab" recipes in Kolkata, you will definitely grab a lot of attention. Yes, Peter Cat has been tingling taste buds since a long time now and has made quite a name for itself in mughlai and continental cuisines. The quality is so good that it makes you wish you could have everything on the menu!

a friend of mine gave us his birthday treat here and not to mention we were eagerly waiting to dug into the famous chello kabab, which did not disappointed us. It was yummy and the platter was sufficent for one person. The place was dimly lit and it was a bit too dark for me. But many people would like that. Our bill came around 1300 for 3 people ordering 3 chello kabab platter and cold drinks.

Khush Zaiqa :) - I would like to recommend all the mutton lovers to indulge themselves with this heavenly and lip smacking dish, Dum Ki Raan- perfect for a non-veg appetite. The juicy mutton in this dish takes on the spicy flavours so beautifully that this dish has become my firm favourite at Peter Cat. Weekends are busy; a minimum 45 minute wait for your food is common at weekends but again it‚Äôs worth waiting for this mouth-watering sizzler.
 
Only negative is the restaurant lighting. The darker ambience makes it look like a tired interior that could have been made more pleasing. Overall Peter Cat gives me an experience that will make me rush back to the restaurant soon.¬†;)

Peter cat is a legendary calcutta restaurant. It is one of the most famous restaurants in the city and has still maintained its old calcutta charm with its dim lights, waitors with classic turbans and the guard who salutes you as you enter and leave. The warmth and the old world ambience attracts you to the place. The chelo kebab is outstanding with its paneer tikka and seekh kebab which literally melt in your mouth alongwith the rice and butter accompaniments. The sizzlers are really delicious too, especially the continental one. If its your first time in the city and you want a taste of the old calcutta I highly recommend peter cat.

This is one of the most traditional restaurants cum bar in Kolkata. So much so that the tradition of food lovers over past many generations must have paid a visit to this traditional joint . If you are from Kolkata or visiting Kolkata, don't miss the chance to tuck into Dum Ki Raan, Chelo ,Prawn Cocktails and of course my favourite chicken steak sizzler ...at a reasonable price you can really get some really good food with a bottle of Dansberg Beer...its a popular choice for everyone and for me I think I have already visited this place over 100times and still love it....

Last week, to celebrate Women‚Äôs day and 9 of us went to Peters Cat for dinner in expectation of a nice meal. After¬† waiting for almost over 45 mins, we finally got a change to go in and order food.

We ordered approximately 3 different dishes of chicken, 1 of mutton, and Tandoori rotis along with a couple of beers and cold drinks.

Now, let me tell you, I have been a regular at Peter‚Äôs cat for quite a few years and never have I had an experience worst as the last one. The food for terrible‚Ä¶ the mutton was tasteless, the chicken too was not upto the mark and one of the chicken dish was sweet!! (The waiter should have told us this particular dish would be sweet‚Ä¶. IF AT ALL) and the Tandoori Rotis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. well I have no words to describe how horrible they were‚Ä¶ even a local way side joint serves tastier and crispier Tandoori roti‚Äôs than what we were served. The staffs waiting on us were inefficient, uninterested and rather rude‚Ä¶

The total bill was of about Rs.3800 and the food and the general experience was totally horrendous and totally not like the one I have had in the past.

I feel Peter‚Äôs cat should make it up to us in some way... maybe refund our money ... atleast that's the decent thing to do.

peter cat..... Previously in my childhood days this restro was one of my favourites. But im very sorry to say that the last 2-3 times I've been there, it serves disappointment more than food. i visited last on 25th dec with my family n bf . the quality of food degraded to a whole new extent. My visit to this restaurant ended the day when the staff misbehaved with us as wel as manager. as they used exta salt on evry dish like our kabbas & evn in signature dish (chelo kabbab) . we called manager n told him bout this but he arrogantly n replyd " mam this is our signature dish cnt b like this , this is the dish which made us famous. We r best @ this . You could hv tell us b4 u eat . We could hv chnge. "

GUYS ? TELL ME 1THING? TRULY? is this possible to tell anythg b4 strt eating? And on 25thChristmas aftr a big line we got a sit, Aftr getng sit they took 45 mint to served our food. Again i will tell them to chnge the food ? they surely would hv made us more wait. we was too hungry aftr waiting so much time.
And manager shamelessly telling us this their signature food? Wow!
See my point is this " if this is ur signature dish u should make atlist this dish perfect. Coz its festive time ppl will eat this 1 for sure. If serving this food made u famous thn u should make that food tasty nt nasty with full of salt." n aftr this they r confidentiality sayng this signature dish.

Actually this restaurant naw this day flying with their old heritage famous name nathg eles. This restuarant use to b one of my best place for food evr. hospitality goes like this thn it wont take much time to lose ur fame.

Anyone looking forward to dining in this restaurant may consider a new choice as i would definitely not recommend any of my frinds going there on festivals or any occasion. Nothing more to say.

1400 reviews and all positive, obviously it was a must visit place.. But guys m disappointed. We called them at around 10 pm to check if they are open and they said they are till 11.30. We reached at 10.45 and were offerd our place. They made us feel that coz of us they have to wait and they are unable to go home. Staff behaviour was bad. Food we wanted was unavailable. They suggestd us chelo kabab which was actualy good.. But apart from that NAYANTARA a mix veg was worst. Breads were not up to the mark. They served the starter and main course together.. Worst part was that around 5 of the staff were standin on our head makin us hell uncmfrtable.. It was like they were waitn for us to finish n go.. We dint even finished our food and one of them asked, 'sir bill kar du?'.. Next moment the other one started pickin up plates.. No more words.. Hell disappointed..

Kolkata's one of the oldest restaurant. Brimmed with posh crowd. Less options for a vegetarian but  all that's there is good. The lamps truly adds to the mood.

I visited this place last week for the first time..
Every other time i tried i was too dissapointed with the long que infront of it so never really had the patience for it. But yay finally we made it inside last week :D
I just wanted to try their oh so famous chello kababs..and as suggested by my brother also the house special sizzler. We ordered them fast and asked for some lime soda till it arrives.
Lime soda was quite refreshing. Sizzler and chello kababs were yummylicious. Sizzler had one poch egg,beautifully cooked chicken,sausages,most importantly the sauce that they used is amazing.it just makes up the whole mood of the dish. I was a fan of mocambo's sizzler before but after tasting this i am sure will be coming back for more. The taste is still stuck in my tongue. Not to forget the kababs were equally heart touching but i have seen so many reviews on it here i prefer not to repeat.
Yes,i am still drooling!

Since many years Peter Cat has been one of the top most favorable restaurants in park street. A chelo kebab platter or sizzler along with a bottle of your favorite beer is what I prefer whenever I drop by this one with my friends. Good service and great ambience. Avoid weekends due to heavy rush.

Peter Cat is one of the most talked about restaurants in town, and hence needs no introduction.
Location: Hit the Park st and you are almost there. If you still can't find, don't use GMaps, ask localites.¬†
Ambiance: Dimly lit Red hues create the aura. Enough space to accommodate large number of customers, still you will find queue during weekends or festive seasons, just to remind you the popularity of the restaurant. well, waiting here for food is worth of your time. 3.5/5
Service: Personally, I like the dress code of the staffs. It gives you an essence of old Calcutta. They are well behaved. If you order signature dishes like chelo, waiting time is not much, But if you order other than that, prepare yourself to spend time with your table mates before the food arrives. 3.5/5
Food: Been here, Haven't tasted their Chelo Kebab??? Is there anyone? It's bliss. A platter with rice, butter, egg, chicken kebabs with onion and capsicum clubbed together and Mutton sheikh Kebab. What else one can ask for a delicious gastronomic experience? Well well, at least before my last visit, I would have said, It tastes heavenly. But unfortunately, the signature dish isn't exactly the same as before. The quality has deteriorated. Last time, The mutton sheikh Kebabs were not up to the mark. Also, the quantity of rice has become less. Please, please Peter cat, don't make us disappointed with your signature dish. It's a request. Previously 4.5/5, Now 3/5

One of the renowned and most talked about restaurants of Kolkata, situated at the Park street area. You should always make reservation before dropping in to avoid waiting in the long queue during anytime of the day, this place is always crowed. Essentially known for its delectable sizzlers and scrumptious chello kebabs, this dimly lit place serves other cuisines as well, but its better to stick to the sizzlers and the chellos that they are famous for. For Chinese visit bar-b-q two minutes walk from the place. Service is pretty good. Ambiance is not killer, but not bad either. Its a place best for celebration with buddies, not for a romantic date, unless only and only good food is what you and your partner is looking for. I personally like their decor. A must try.

Peter Cat is one of the most famous restaurants in Kolkata and needs no introduction.Frankly saying I found the interiors a bit dull,though the dim lighting creates a nice mood.I had the Veg Chelo Kebab, Rajma Galouti Kebab and Tandoori Brochholi.

I really loved the Chelo Kebab.The dish consisted of Veg Seekh kebab,Tandoori Aloo and Paneer Tikka with a portion of rice and butter.The kebabs were well done and very flavourful.The paneer had a kind of achari taste to it.Also it went well with the buttered rice.
Coming to the broccoli,I must say that it was better the last time I had it.This time the broccoli seemed a bit raw and the flavour hadnt seeped in so well.
The Galouti Kebab was average .Also the dish wasnt really warm.Galouti Kebabs are more flavoursome .The dish had a unidimensional kind of flavour.

I'm giving them a 3.5 just because of the Chelo Kebab,I'v had better here.Quality should not vary so much.

It's one of my favourite restaurants of the city. I love it here. Some of the best memories of my life have this place as a common link. Amazing location (need I even mention that?). Great service. A private space. Plus the upper storey that exudes charm. 
Coming to food. 
The chelo!! Oolaalaa... The kebabs. The water poach. Just everything on that palate.   Touche!
But this time I had the roast chicken sizzler for a change. And not only am I extremely satisfied with the choice but hoping to repeat the order as well! 
The only grainy bit in this otherwise great place... There seems to be a small tumble in the food quantity. 
Well... All said, it's a must visit! :)

The Legendary Peter Cat is one of the very few restaurants in Kolkata which cannot disappoint you and that is the very reason for the popularity it has within us kolkatans. Ambiance is good with dim lighting , a bit old fashioned , some might say , but keeping in mind the number of years it has been around , its not much of a problem . Coming to the food , Chelo kebabs are a must try !! The Tandoori Mix Grill Sizzler is very nice too ! meat is juicy and tender and prices are very reasonable .¬†If you are in Kolkata , you should definitely be there at least once ! Its a must visit !

This legendary place in Kolkata does not need an introduction. Every kid to grown-up in the city will have some or the other memory attached to the place and will definitely be nostalgic about it. Celebrities frequenting the place, movies being shot every now and then, and needless to say, the history that goes back to decades, each goes in making the restaurant a must visit eat-out destination. The place is always huss and buss with visitors and managing a table in 15 minutes of waiting in queue is no less than an achievement.
So what makes it so different and special! The unique range of food they serve of-course, with their secret recipe. To my surprise their menu is literally shaped in the form of a cat. And what tops it all in the menu is ‚Äì ‚ÄòChelo Kabab‚Äô. I had heard so much about this particular dish that could not wait to order this. This is a platter with set of utterly soft chicken kebabs and two steaks of mutton kebabs. They like to serve these around fragrant rice wonderfully slithered in ghee. It is topped with a nicely done poch. Baked tomato and smashed potato also accompany these. If you are done with this dish and still left with some appetite, then prawn cocktail is a must try. Betki Muenier from their seafood section also makes it to my recommendation list. Very soft fish is battered and served smeared in white sauce. Before you realize what all went in, the soft chunks just dissolve. The buzz of sizzlers being served was aloud. When it comes to dessert, I can bet if the fullness of the dishes spares you a corner. The range is good though. Here I will also put a disclaimer; the place may not live up to its name but for the placid ambience. Every table lit by a dim hanging lamp enough just to see what you are digging in. Rest all kept dark deliberately to cut aloof each table of the other.
In your next visit to the city buzzing with yellow ambassadors, don‚Äôt forget to book one straight to the heart of Park Street and gorge on to be part of this awesome food odyssey.

Taste buds: Jumping with joy
Pocket shouts: Little heavy
When I look around: No point taking your eyes off table when it is kept dark around
Waiting time for tummy: Not very long if you manage a table

Keep gorging!

To Calcuttans, Peter Cat does not need an introduction or deserve a conclusion.

To others, this is a favorite of families and everyone else.

Every weekend you can see a group of people waiting outside, eagerly and hungrily, for the moment when they get to dig into the heavenly Prawn Cocktail, the smoky Special Sizzler and the ever popular Chelo Kabab.

Almost all dishes on the menu are good but the above 3 take the cherry with half the customers coming in just for them.

Went to Peter Cat for their famous Chelo kababs. There must be many reviews written about this famous dish. Aromatic rice with butter, eggs and chicken kababs. Awesome taste and excellent quality of the food, especially the authentic chelo kabab keep this place crowded 365 days. Sizzlers were also very good.¬†
Since this place is always crowded, so would recommend that you reach a bit early. They don't take reservations over the phone.
It has a very dim and dark interior giving it the retro ambience. Food is also affordable.

This¬† is not really one of the old timers of the Park Street area¬†like Mocambos,Trincas,Mags as it came up only in the late 70s. Nonetheless its builtup a fairly loyal clientel. The decor is warm and inviting as is the name of the place.Seating is comfy and the service effecient. Peter Cat serves decent quality Continental and English food. The Tandoori dishes,especiallly the kebabs,(Chelo is a must try) The chicken do pyaza,butter masala,prawns and fish are all tasty and very satisfying. The English cusine such as the fried fish,grilled¬† or poached especially the Beckti are super as is the Prawn cocktail. italian is not really their forte though and the sauces taste heavily of maida !! Stick to the Tandoori dishes and curries or the fish and prawns for western and you cant go wrong.Not the Best food in town but worth a try and youre sure to enjoy it.

Peter Cat is one of my favorite in the city of joy. Every time I go, it's a new experience. You don't get to feed yourself just anywhere like you do, when you are at Peter Cat.

When it's about menu, I can't seem to wrap my head around just one thing cause it's all great in itself. Chelo Kebabs are everyone's favorite but I choose to go for Shah Nauz.. It's a must try. Prices are not too much to worry about as it's between the lines of high and low.

So good is the ambiance and food that you got to wait for your turn to get a place inside and that's what makes it different cause people do. I simply love it!!

Peter cat is the classic park street restaurant. 
I always come out with a happy tummy and big smile. The only thing that might dampen your hunger is the long waiting at peter cat. But I have never been disappointed with the food. The dim lights adds to the charm of this place.¬†
My recommendationsChelo Kebab - A must try at Peter Cat.¬†
Beckty Muniere - A delicious preparation of fish in a creamy butter white sauce.¬†Prawn cocktail - A chilled appetizer of prawns. This is again creamy and very yummy.
Never tried desserts at this place. Cocktails are average.¬†I always find people complaining about the rude behaviour of the waiters. Thankfully, I have never faced any. They have always been very nice and friendly.

We went there before Christmas and there was a waiting time of 15 minutes, usual for Peter Cat. It was my first time and I was yearning to taste the famous Chelo Kebab. However, we began with a few cocktails and the coveted Dum-Ki-Raan. I must say the Raan was the best I've ever tasted. It was soft, juicy, perfectly spiced and cooked. The cocktails were amazing , though less in volume.¬†
We tried the Chicken Tikka too, which wasn't disappointing. It was good, if not the best. Finally came the Chelo Kebab - priced at Rs 315. Since I had it for the first time, I liked it pretty much. Both the kebabs were well cooked and huge in quantity. The rice was fragrant and slithered with butter. The poach was perfect and overall it was a great dish. Would definitely go back and try the other stuff. The service and ambiance are good too.

I have been to this place six times. I know, because I counted. It's very hard to get a table here, which I totally say as a compliment. The restaurant is always crowded because it's one of the- if not THE- best places to eat in my city. 

The atmosphere is un-matchable, and the serving is of world class quality. You get your food served to you not later than it's not worth of. What I mean is: the food is so good that you can actually forgive them for taking some time to present your order to you.

And the menu is filled with a great many options to select from, which includes both food and drinks. The price is a little on the higher side, but that too is completely justified because of the experience you will have here.

I assure you that all your senses will be satisfied in this place. At least that is what happens to me every time. 

And I must also include that even so it is famous for its Chelow Kabab, the restaurant has many other dishes that are as good if not better. Try as many of them you can on your visits.

Yes, it's a five for Peter! I used to be a mutton virgin, not anymore and gladly so! There could have been no better way to break my mutton fast than chelo kabab. The look of the dish is so appealing and the taste is unparalled. Truly you won't ever taste something like it elsewhere. The mutton kabab is soft and so is the chicken. The butter cubes are a beauty to behold and gobble. I tried a different chicken kabab dish (don't remember the name). It was spicy to the exact amount and the kind that makes you lose in the moment.
Dim lights, cheerful environment and smiling staff are the charms to make a perfect full score.

Anyone who has grown up in Calcutta will know what a big deal Peter Cat is. Movies are shot there, celebrities go there, stories are made entailing it etc. I find it quite futile writing a review for it because everyone loves this place. The Prawn Cocktails, the sizzler then chelo kebab - YUM. As for the sweetness, I have always admired their dessert menu though I've never had room for it . Happens each and every time and mind you I have been there many a time over the years. The only critically pathetic part about this place is the queue. Forget weekdays and holidays - ¬†we've always visited the place on a weekday and before 1.00pm. That is the only time, we've never faced a queue. It almost like an achievement getting a table there!

The food is good specially the grilled fish and the chel-o-kebab. But do not be fooled by the food. The waiters are  of the worst kind. They make you wait for a long time and their behaviour has made me decide never ever to visit this place again

This place is not for VEGANS.!
I visited the place to have the infamous Chelo Kebabs served by them and I did not like any single bit of the food they served.
It appears to me that this place is good for the non-vegetarians and the amazing reviews are & must be from the non-vegetarians itself and not the vegetarians.!

70's dime light ambience. Chelo kebab and badami chicken kebab are what am fond of the place for. The best restaurant in the town that makes the perfect Chelo Kebab

The quality of food and service has deteriorated a bit over the past few years according to me. But the place still holds so much of nostalgia. The food is a bit expensive. The ambience is pretty nice. I love the cat shaped menu card!

Must try- Fish steak, chelo kebab, Waldorf salad and meringue with chocolate sauce!

A very good restuarant. One must try the chelo kabab and its sizzlers. Quite ok on your pocket too. Service and staff are good.

A friend and I went for dinner at around 10. Had to wait for more than an hour. Finally got two seats in an ill lit corner at 11:20. We were asked to order everything at once and the waiter wouldn't give us five minutes to go through the menu. Rushed through the menu and ordered the main course ( one veg and one non-veg) and a dessert. The veg dish was a disappointment. The dish was so dry that I asked for a bottle of coke and was denied the same since they apparently closed the fridge. The dessert was also not worth the money. The service is poor. Vegetarians will have a bad time there. Non-veg food seems to be good. The whole waiting process is so frustrating. Go there only if you have hours to simply waste.

The one thing I noticed about this restro is that whenever you go you will find people waiting in queue and this am seeing from my childhood. This statement only depicts how popular the joint is. Will not spent my words to review this restro. The only thing  I would rather say that during last 5 years on stay outside Kolkata, whenever I come to city I make sure i visit to Peter cat. Today I went with my friend and needles the day the experience was very amazing in terms of food, ambience, quality and in everything. Keep rocking!!!

Divine!!!! That's the feeling one has after having a lunch at Peter Cat!!!!! I decided to go out for a lunch with a friend of mine.... He suggested Peter Cat!!!! It was around 2pm, the place was quite full and there were people waiting but we managed to get a table since only two of us were there......
Well Peter Cat reminds you of restaurants seen in old movies.... With very minimal decor and dim lights the place has its own unique aura.....
Chelo Kebabs!!!! That's what usually I or rather every second person orders at Peter Cat.... So this time me and my friend decided to order something different..... Since there were not many options in vegetarian, so we ordered the next best thing one gets at Peter Cat which is Sizzler!!! We ordered a Vegetable Mixed Grill Sizzler with dinner rolls and fresh lime soda for beverages..... The platter was simply outstanding, especially the Sheek Kebabs in it were amazing...... Eat,Eat & Eat!!!! That's what we felt at that time..... We were fully satisfied with our meal....
Given so many plus points Peter Cat has a few negatives also which it needs to work upon.... One of them is lack of space, the tables are really small in size and distance between the two separate tables is kept at minimal..... God knows why?!?! But the biggest lack in Peter Cat is of a good and mannered staff!!!! I would say Peter Cat has the most uncourteous staff in the city restaurants which impacts the delicious food it offers!!!! They need to hire a good lot!!!! Maybe in the near future one could see Peter Cat overcome its shortcomings!!!!
But on the whole Peter Cat is an excellent place to dine out with friends and family!!!!
I still have a craving for the mouth watering Chelo Kebabs!!! I think I should I have ordered them too........

That good old place for a plate of Chelo Kabab.

Order a plate of Chelo and forget about rest of the world. The Fish Makhmali, as the name suggest, will melt into your mouth. Mutton Rogan Jush or Brain Masala have the perfect potential to go with the Chelo Kabab. You may try the steaks, and they will not disappoint you. I would suggest you to visit this place once and make some good memories of Kolkata.

Very disappointed. Never expected this from this restaurant. I had been to this place on 25th..ofcourse celebration day i agree you have to wait. I had been in waiting for 2.5 hours outside where there was extreme mismanagement. Finally we got in and ordered here's signature dish Chelo Rice. We heard a lot about this place and this dish, being new in the city. But that seems my terrable mistake. Food was utterly disgusting. and above all it was full of salt. Tottaly uneatable. I faced very humiliation because i took my family and my relatives saying this restro is the best in park street. But never seen a restaurant being so bad at its signature dish. Very disappointed. And apart from the food part, staff management is very bad, the dont know how to behave and as well tge the management. May be I am the only one who has got so many complaints about the place but I suggest not to visit this place in occasions. You gonna face a lot of disappointments.

Peter cat is very popular place to go and I went to try out their most popular dish 'chelo kabab'- exotic buttered rice with portions of mutton and chicken kebabs topped off with an egg.. It's a creamy delight for your mouth.  Other items are good too..

Perhaps the only place where the food not only pacified my stomach but also pleased my mind and heart. This place definitely needs no introduction. The food, its taste, the ambience, the staffs, seating arrangement, everything, was more than being "just right". Ambience is very soothing, even though the restaurant is crowded even on weekdays, u dont feel ur privacy being disturbed by the presence of fellow guests sitting adjacent to you. Lighting and spaces around you makes you feel more comfortable. No over the top interiors, simple decoration, has a mezzanine floor above, gives a different experience. Staffs are very busy so may not appear courteous, but are polite and soft spoken, Wearing a smile on their face could have helped though :) . Their a-la-carte menu does give you the option to choose from the many exotic and unique dishes it has to offer. Upon recommendation by my friends i ordered a portion of Mutton Chello Kabab along with a portion each of Egg mayonnaise and a variant of mutton biryani called Biryani-al-nawabi. Just as described by my friends the Mutton Chello Kabab was simply outstanding. Even the butter rice served with it was amazing!! I dont know how the butter rice tasted so great but it actually did. The mutton reshmi kabab and the chunks of mutton kabab in it was purely delightful. The texture was smooth, so soft that it nearly melted in my mouth. The sunny-side up poached egg was to sooth the pallette and satisfy all the taste buds in the mouth before the next dish arrived. The mutton biryani seemed and tasted more like the biryanis that i have had in kerala, smaller grains of rice that are spicy and had an extra kick of mustard oil on it. Yes the biryani was tasting less of ghee and more of vegetable oil in it. Nevertheless, this different version of biryani did impress me a lot. In the end i went for the egg mayonnaise, and it did surprise me with its creaminess and absolute joy of egg slices and vegetable cubes in it. Its more like a Russian salad with egg slices placed carefully on top of it without getting its yolk displaced, and the whole thing is covered evenly with an extra layer of mayonnaise. An absolute fattening but outrageously delightful taste that keeps u in euphoria as long as it has its leftover in ur mouth. But one note of precaution, this egg mayonnaise is a very heavy and large dish and its appearance is deceptive. So its advisable that a portion of egg mayonnaise should be shared. I chose to eat it in the end cuz mayonnaise doesnt allows my taste buds to taste anything else. We ended this feast with a can of Coke Zero. We were left heavy and pleasantly sedated and this euphoric feeling continued for the next 8 hours.
By far, this was the outstanding experience I ever had in my culinary journey. I had never tasted such elegant yet brutally and ridiculously good food. These three dishes and two cans of coke zero costed us Rs. 1070 including tax. Had to pay Rs. 50 tip to the waiter who was looking eagerly at us after giving us the change back. Didnt bother at this as i just had the food that was best in taste i ever had. Besides, paying Rs. 1100/- for such a great culinary experience for two mouths to feed is very economical. Saying "Peter cat rocks" or "Peter cat is awesome" is definitely an understatement for me. I highly recommend this restaurant. I was thinking of giving 4.5/5 to this restaurant due to the few shortcomings like waiters asking for more tips, waiters appearing scary and dead serious all the time, but recalling the taste of the foods is overshadowing any negative thoughts that I am having for this place. Am going to this restaurant again soon!! :)

Being owned by the same person,this restaurant has the same exact feel as that of mocambo. Mocambo is my first choice though.

I went to this place to try out the chello kebab.It was good.I wonder why people love it so much.I would rather have a sizzler,where I get more meat.I wont be dying to have a chello kebab next time.

I have been going there for a while, food as usual has been good but their service is quite disappointing. The waiters carry some sort of an arrogant attitude while taking the order/serving and will stand on your head if not tipped. Ambience is fine but it's high time they change it a little bit. All in all, if you're not too finicky about the ambience and service go there for the food coz that's still quite good.

For me stands synonymous to nostalgia! I went back after years and still found their chelo kebab the best! The taste has remained unchanged and intact! Apart from chelo kebab, the lambs they served were succulent and delicious! Peter Cat continues to preserve the essence of park street and still delights foodies with it's plethora of standardised tasty food. Meal for two:Rs2000 (includes starters, main course and arrested drink)

Peter Cat was the 1st ever restaurant from where do I started my journey as out food except the street food in the way back 18 years ahead.
It's been same interior, no table reservation , long waiting, as usal in park street conventional food places.
The Furite punch was too bad in teast.
Salad was good.. chello kabab is nice...
We to order biraynai for our parents... was terrible just boiled pices of chickens potatoes and some rices with stuff of oil... 
In kolkata all biraynai centres and chains are almost do have some similar preparation but last night briyani was just too bad... will surely never recommend anyone to have briyani in Peter cat again...

Had a chance to visit this eatery after a long time... had lot many memories from my college days and was waiting for long to enjoy the much famed 'Chelo Kebab' ...

Visited early January. The ambience was same as before - dim lit tables, servers in turbans rushing around, pretty high on the decibel level - well I kinda like it... give you a very vibrant atmosphere as soon as you enter..

Ordered the typical fare - Chelo kebab and sweetened lime soda.¬†

Can't say it matched my sky high expectations which I had walked in with, but still yummy. The chicken kebab were made to perfection, mutton ones were okay okay, a little rough. The buttered rice was a perfect accompaniment.¬†

Overall a nice experience... Would be back next time am back in town.

As usual excellent sizzler. Been visiting there since 1995 but the taste remains same. Cooked to perfection. Had sizzlers in so many places across India but nothing like Peter Cat.¬†
But was disappointed with the behavior of the staff. Was allotted 8 seater in the ground floor. But its as good as 4 seater. The AC was not working properly. Requested them to change the seat and about the AC. The answer was negative and in a very rude fashion. May be they don't care if we had just walked out.

This place has a really nice ambience. I went to this place for dinner with my Dad and we ordered north Indian food. The food taste was just average. I could find much better tasting food at small dhabas in my hometown Chandigarh. But as mentioned in the reviews, this place is famous for its kebabs and sizzlers. So, if I ever get a chance to visit it again, I will definitely try its kebab and sizzler.

If you have lived in kolkata for long enough, peter cat is a name a foodie just can't miss. I went here during my initial days in kolkata when I wasn't knowing much about the city. This place also remains close to my heart as I had proposed my current gf here.
Now coming to the details. This place is a heritage, people would say. While I respect their feeling, I didn't found anything 'heritagy' here. You can get numerous restaurants in mumbai which have been serving since ages, Leopold Cafe of colaba being my favourite one. Also the waiters of peter cat were behaving as if they've not been paid. They make aggorant faces if you ask them anything. Now coming to the food, sorry to say but the food too wasn't any great. Ambience is pretty decent, with some tables on the back giving privacy.
Location- 4.5/5 (Its Park Street dude!!)
Ambience- 3.5/5
Music- none I can remember
Food-3/5
Staffs:3/5
Although this place didn't live up to my expectations. I would like to visit it once again just to cherish the memories and to try chelo kabab.

So much hype about this one! Was really excited when I went there last week with my family. We ordered chelo kebabs, fried rice, grilled bekti, butter dal tadka and chicken reshmi butter masala. Chelo kebab wasn't anything special. Chicken kebabs were good. But I particularly didn't like the mutton kebabs in it. Grilled fish was all cheese. I don't know about others, but I didn't like it at all. The chicken was delicious although. Loved it. The dal was good too. The ambience was certainly nice, no doubt about that. The staff people were nice too .

I have had sizzlers in many places back in Mumbai. I was in Kolkata with a friend for a few days. He resides back in Kolkata so he know the where about there. He recommended me Peter Cat for sizzlers and he said the Chelo kabab is must try. When i ordered my sizzler i was pretty excited and as it turns out the food was great.It had that brilliant flavors and balance of spices blended together and cooked to perfection. The chelo kabab had flavors to tingle the buds to next level. The rice was balanced cook and was amazing. All the components in the dish were perfect. No spice was extra or no extra component was added to the dish. It was balanced perfect and the most amazing food I have ever tried in my life. This restaurant is a must try and highly recommended

Peter cat is one of the most reknowned restaurants in the Park street. It is located opposite to KFC and adjacent to Au Bon. Peter Cat has always made me wait and do away with my dining fast because the rush of people outside the resto keeps growing with time. The staff is polite and it is a well-organised place. I love the lights inside but interiors can be improved. Coming to the food, the first item I would suggest people to go for is their esteemed Chelo kebab which is always beautifully made. Apart from chelo kebab, grilled chicken sizzlers, prawn cocktail, chicken tandoori, sag chicken,peas paratha are delicious. For the dessert I always stick to my personal favourite i.e. brownie with vanilla ice cream and choc sauce. It amazes me everytime I indulge in the dessert. One can also go for Tutty frutti. Peter cat is an expensive restaurant so make sure your pocket pinch is sound enough . Give Peter cat a shot if you are at Kolkata. Chelo kebab will drive you insane. :)

Heavy delight!
A friend suggested this and it's real close to flurrys and on Middleton row .
It's a little conspicuous but ask the young population and they'd guide you right!
The staff is super friendly and communicate very well!
They have a cozy dark place with good crowd.
At lunch hours often there is a waiting as I reckoned from others.
The food :
I ordered a minestrone italliene soup and tomato soup! The earlier was just plain sweet but the later satisfied the hunger.
The makhmali fish was yummy and melted in the mouth.
The malai kofta and the masala kulcha was huge!
The Roti's too were way too huge.
Overall it was delicious and accessible! So it's a great place to visit!
PS: Toilet is on the first floor.
Its colder on the first floor.

Nothing really great about the place, good concept but the food was average. We ordered Chelo kebabs, which was nothing new to the Delhiites palate. The sizzlers (grilled fish, house special and dum ki raan) were a tad bit bland for our taste. The service was surprisingly slow. Wouldn't recommend further.

Eat, eat and keep eating!

Started off with the spring chicken soup..strictly ok..nothing great. Then the adventure began with the prawn cocktail..Brilliant stuff. We then ordered the chicken irani kabab and the fish makhmali..the chicken was the usual reshmi kabab types but the fish was extremely well prepared. very tender and perfectly spiced!

Main course was the chelo kabab and the chicken sizzler. Chelo kabab is definitely one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. Out of this world! The chicken sizzler was a bit disappointing. 4 pieces of grilled chicken. Thats it. No rice or noodles.¬†

Dessert was caramel soufle and meringue with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. We dug into it and finished it in a minute.

Overall, superb place. great ambience. lovely food. quite reasonable. Top up your meal with a meetha pan outside. You would have never felt more contented!

Long waiting time outside the restaurant everytime I visited. The waiters and busboys are very rude. They chat among themselves in high pitched voice, and don't know modesty. One time they even came and told pointing at my girlfriend that she cannot drink as she is underage, without even asking for i.d. first or verifying. People skills, my ass. 
However, the Chelo Kebabs are worth every shenanigans I guess, being the only thing keeping this place alive to date.

Amazing, ethereal and divine food, at a price for mere mortals

Being from out of town, pretty much everyone's recommendation was Peter Cat.
I can't remember the names of anything we had because two dishes just blew me away: The Chelu kabab and fish sizzler. If you are not from Kolkata, you HAVE to try this because there is pretty much no place which will provide a meal as unique as this. It seems simple: shasliq style tikka kabab (chicken or mutton), sheek and buttered rice. But the taste, the ambiance and the overall combination of all the components creates a unique taste you can't quite describe.
The fish sizzler was above par, considering I come a city with no shortage of sizzler caf√©s. The freshness of the ingredients and the semi-antique ambience seem to add to the flavour of everything

No introduction is needed when it comes about the famous place from where we know of chelo kebab....situated opposite to the kfc restaurant...the all time favourite place for sizzlers,are always serving with consistency...I have been there several times... Have had chelo kebab,roast chicken sizzler,grilled fish sizzler,fried prawns,peter cat special dessert,chocolate nut sundae and sula cabarnet shiraz wine....though I didn't take all of them at a time of course...the food served are quite fresh and fast,the perfect blend of all the ingredients...overall it will always be the all time favourite with a great budget I would say...

Peter Cat is one of my favourite restaurant in Park street area.I loved their ambiance.My favourite item is Chelo Kebab.It is just unique dish all over in kolkata.The combination of kebab & butter mixed rice is just outstanding.I also loved their Chicken Biriyani.They used Fry onion in this biriyani.This taste is delicious.In dessert their tutti frutty is good.service is quick.waiters are polite.price is little expensive.

Theres biriyani and rolls in Calcutta and then there is Chello Kebab! And the place we can think of for Chello Kebab is Peter Cat! The spread hasn't changed and the taste hasnt too for more than 10 years now! Every trip to Calcutta is incomplete without chello kebabs at PeterCat....

Finally went Peter Cat on my B'day on 4th Feb,2015 with my Girl friend.

The ambiance was very good.

The wait is worth.We ordered Chelo Kabab,House Special Sizzler and Persian Polao all of the dish was awesome.

The waiter's behavior is okay type.

We enjoyed a lot there and enjoyed the food.

The usual fame dish chelo kebab, pulao nd chicken bharta was fr the main course.. and finally there was my fav part- the vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce nd strawberry wafer.. made my day! :)

Peter Cat is my favourite restaurant in Kolkata. Some people cry out that peter cat is over hyped and over crowded but I live with the peter cat mania. I can stand outside peter cat for an hour to get a seat and enjoy the food. Located at central park street, it is one of the busiest restaurants in the city. Over the years, price has increased considerably but the craze is still there.

Chelo Kebab is the hottest item and with the decreasing amount of rice everyday - the fan following and craze seem to increase. An unique persian dish introduces first in Kolkata and many other competitors have tried copying that. But Peter Cat is still the best.

Sizzlers are very good and at a very reasonable price. Go for the tandoori mixed grill.

Indian food at Peter cat is also good - lasooni naan, keema naan, fish makhmali kebab, seekh kebab, dum-ki-raan (wow, what a mutton dish, soft and succulent), mutton rogan josh, chicken butter masala- all hugely recommended.

Overall 4.5 for my favourite restaurant.

Went to this place yesterday with friends.No doubt the food is delicious & the service prompt.Tried the famous "chelo kebab" it was quite good.Also had  chicken cocktail which was yummy.However was very much disaapointed by the behavior of the staff.The waiters are rude & pass rude comments like "order quickly there are other people waiting" or "kokhun theke boshe ache era(since when are they sitting here)" .My friends were very upset & it spoilt our good moods!! This is so NOT a place to hang out!!! you would feel that you are back to school with strict rules!

Sure, there was a mix up. They served us the NV Chello Kebab. And we assumed it was the vegetarian one. But once that was replaced, it was amazing. Add a nice bottle of red wine and the result is one of Calcutta's finest meals.

The must have!

too much of hype, and utter disappointment. the food was good. but the service was poor. at one point of time, we felt that we were sitting next to a glass wall of the restaurant. the waiters/ stewards completely forgot/ overlooked our orders and us. we were not even asked for a glass of plain water until first 25-30 mins after our arrival in there. we had to ask for it. then we asked for the menu. then we asked for our orders. we asked for the orders again after they almost took another 30 mins to serve. in short we had to ask for every sot of stuff like we do in local roadside dhaba, which cost us half of the price we paid here. thumbs down!!

Everyone in Calcutta has to swear by this restaurant; it is that legendary. I have never ordered anything else other than the amazing Chicken Steak Sizzler as my main course. I never tire of it. Other mentionables are Chelo Kabab and the Cocktail Sausages(delightfully soft and spicy). Drinks are nice and cheap. Expect heavy rush during weekends. 

Dimly lit, it is reminiscent of classic old days with vintage interiors. You cannot miss it.

I had always heard about the hype around Peter Cat and their signature dish, Chelo Kebab, and was waiting for a long time to try it. This week I had a guest from Delhi, who wanted to eat at a place that represented this city in terms of food. This place was the first thing that came to my mind and I couldn't have been more disappointed with my decision. We went on a Friday afternoon and got tables quite easily. We were seated upstairs. We ordered for two plates of their famous Chelo kebab. My guest had a sinus problem and with the AC right on top of her head it was getting impossible for her to sit there. We asked the server if we could have our table changed and he spoke to us in the worst manner possible and said that was not possible since our order had already been placed. I was surprised as this was the first time I was hearing something so absurd in a restaurant. And to have been spoken at rudely, it just added to the displeasure. We still requested again and after five minutes of chucking attitude he finally agreed. Also I had asked him to leave the menu on the table since I just wanted to look through it and see if I needed something else and I was told that I would be given one when I needed it and that they can't leave it on the table. The server literally snatched it from my hand. Keeping in mind my guest, I did not say a word to the waiter. When the food finally arrived, it was stone cold and something really very average. I failed to understand the hype around the dish. The sunny side up on top of the rice could have been made better by a small kid. There was no body who came and asked if we wanted anything else or refilled the water or anything. Overall it was one of my worst experience at a restaurant. And it was super embarrassing as well because I had spoken so highly about the place to my guest before taking her there. Never ever again. Oh and they don't even deserve the rating I've given them. Unfortunately zomato doesn't allow me to go lower.

Peter Cat, every time I hear that name, I think about the Sizzler Smoke. Love the smell of Smoked Chicken and Veggies along with garlic sauce.

My personal favourite, Prawn Cocktail is one of the best appetizer I have ever had.

The first choice for the foodies who wanna have a pocket friendly lunch or dinner..
The chelo kebab is the signaturw dish here... Which alone can satisfy ur apetite with its various items on the same plate...

The various sizzlers are also mouth watering...

The only problem is the queuing system... Which is really fraustrating...
If u r a male n wanna party there with ur male frnds only... Then u better not choose this one in evenings... As they always give family-dinner-parties or a group with ladies n kids the first preference, even uf u might have enlisted your name before them... Which made me really irritated.

Two words - Cello Kebabs. 
Worth. Every. Single. Word. 
They are soft, taste delicious with the rice and the butter on top of it. It is way too heavy for a average Joe to eat by himself but damn I have been here every single time I've visited Kolkata and I can't get enough of it. 

Other than that - place is great, staff is courteous, be well in advance it has queues even on weekdays and you might have to wait as long as 30-35 minutes on a normal Friday night.

We've always been great fans of Peter Cat. In fact, anyone coming to our home from out of Calcutta is always taken for a Peter Cat meal. Imagine, then our terrible feeling of total let-down when we went there for lunch today.

First, we were seated at a table that was leaning to the right, so we found ourselves sitting at an angle. The table had neither a table cloth, nor flowers in the unique copper vase. No water was poured out into the glasses, nor was the table rearranged for us (it was a table that seated four, and usually the waiter rearranges things so that it is comfortable for the persons at the table). The bowl with the green chillies and lime was just kind of chucked on the side. We had ordered beer with our food. The waiter usually shows the bottle and asks if it is cold enough. Today, he just poured the beer into our tankards. Then, he brought the bread roll for my husband, picked it up with his hands and dumped it on the side plate. Three roughly cut cubes of butter unattractively displayed on the butter dish were then slid on to the table. My husband had ordered the Tandoori Mixed Grill (Passionately Recommended), which comes under Peter Cat Sizzler Specialities. It came with a very damp sizzle....Worse, the gravy was all over and the vegetables on the side looked as if it had been bunged there - quite unattractive and totally unappetizing. I had ordered a Roast Chicken (non-sizzler) and after the 'Sizzler's' sizzling had all but fizzled out, my plate came - it looked a mess. I've never, ever, ever seen food displayed so badly in Peter Cat, or served so carelessly. I don't know which shocked me more - that one of my favorite restaurants had disappointed me so badly, or that the food was lousy. 

Sad. Sad. Sad.

peter cat is always best place for lunch out with friends.. and its worth spending money there.. but the most important thing is ''YOU NEED TO HAVE PAITENCE'' to get your turn, as its always crowded ,you need to wait for your turn which can be upto 30-40 minutes, but i would say its worth waiting for the yummest awesum food. I visited peter cat on 25th jan, when for birthday lunch with my friends ....we ate lavishly.. firstly we ordered chicken tikka kebaabs two plates, chicken sleak sizzlers two plates, mutton chelo kabaab, veg chelo kebaab, and fresh lime soda, kebaabs were very tasty well cooked,and sizzler was sizzliling ...awesum.., then the main course was followed by chicken kashmiri biryani, and chicken reshmi butter masala... ..,¬†
chicken reshmi butter masala was superb, the gravy was very tasty, and the pieces of chicken was also quiet good. overall an awesum experience.. would definately love to visit again..

Okay now. Where do I begin? The Shahi attire of the ever so polite waiters or the sheer magnificence of the Chelo Kabab.. This restaurant in Park Street is perhaps one of the best the city has to offer. So if you're still hesitating, please don't. Cause' Peter Cat is worth every dime you spend in there.

Recently visited Kolkata and I was amazed by the rave reviews and the cult status enjoyed by this restaurant. So decided to give it a try.

We were two hungry souls who managed to reach this restaurant at 3 pm and to our surprise it was still crowded. Managed to squeeze in after waiting for some good 20 minutes.

AMBIANCE - The ambiance was quite good with the tables closely packed.¬†

FOOD - We were pretty much hungry by the time we entered so skipped the soup and jumped to the main course . Having read so many rave reviews about the iconic Chello Kababs couldn't stop myself from trying those out. So we tried out the famous The Original Chello Kabab and the Veg Chello Kabab. The Chello Kabab had a generous portion of meat and rice with the butter cubicles. To be honest both the Kababs were good but not great or heavenly as I had expected it to be. We also tried the Vegetable mixed grill sizzlers and it was also just okay and unfortunately we couldn't manage to complete it.¬†

SERVICE - The service was swift but the staff need to be trained on some manners. The server just banged the plates on the table. I do understand that the restaurant is pretty crowded and the service has to be swift but not compromising on some basic etiquettes.

FINAL VERDICT - ¬†Peter Cat is a very good place if you want to have some quick food or catch up with your buddies. The price being very nominal for the quality of food offered it is definitely a place to visit.

If you havent been to Peter Cat on your trip to Park Street, Kolkata, please, please, turn back and head there right now.¬†
Very rightly put under legendary category here, is this ancient food heaven where almost everything you get to order is simply awesome.¬†
On my various earlier visits, I have stuck to the very predictable and droolworthy Chello Kebab and a Screwdriver.¬†
But this time, on 27th Jan, for lunch, I and my ex-colleague went in, and we wanted to try something else. We went for the sizzlers and kebab. We ordered the Irani Kebab and a Chicken Grilled Sizzler and a Chicken Roast Sizzler each. Plus, she took a Pineapple Drink (read pineapple milk shake) and I took a screwdriver.
After a wait of about 10 mins, before we could smell it, or see it, we heard our food arrive.¬†
Now the sizzlers are were very much no frills, no nonsense, simply delicious strips of meat. And yes, they gave us four blocks of butter to use as intended :p
We had ordered a bread roll with it, but none of us even took a bite of it, we were simply too full.
Not missing the kebabs, they were soft, very tasty and simply melted away the minute we bit em.¬†
I ll reiterate, if you have a budget of 500 rs and want to have an awesome lunch, please just get in here and you wont regret it!

This joint has achieved a cult status now as it can be safely be called a part of one of Kolkata's most-visited-places. 

The inventor of the legendary "Chello-Kabab" continues to run. The ambience is cramped and loud, but that's the USP. The food is truly awesome, but the service has slightly degraded over the years. Thankfully the food hasn't. 

Be prepared for queuing up indefinitely if you are planning to visit this place.

It is natural to get swayed away in emotions while recollecting this place especially when you are a Calcuttan. I am really not sure how much this place might be loved by someone who doesn‚Äôt have any attachment with the city. It can be perceived to be normal fine dine place with nothing-out-of-the-world d√©cor or service or ambience serving good food. But then, I am a Calcuttan.

¬†It is very difficult to try out any other option when you have chelo kebab in the menu. What I love about this dish is the fact that the whole platter is so rightly spiced. The kebabs are soft and juicy and mildly flavored, having the right amount of charcoal flavor. The flat egg on the rice with an ample portion of butter and blanched tomato- these are ordinary ingredients, but in this platter, they all look and taste so exotic! In the desserts, I like the stylish way they serve brownie with vanilla and chocolate sauce. But otherwise I find their dessert menu a bit dull. 

They are quite good at their service. I find their ambience very special as it is always cheerful and happy, with diners very busy in their ‚Äòadda‚Äô. This place is a must visit for every Calcuttan.

It is difficult to write something new for a leader like peter cat. Park street gastronomy scene is incomplete without the chelo kababs of peter cat.
Since , most of us would have tested chelo kababs at one point or the other , I would rather like to mention the absolute cracker of a dish , dum di raan , today.
It is the entire back leg of a goat , devoid of bones. Smoked and sauted with onion,chillies and garlic spices. A heavenly side as an accompaniment to rum or whisky. Ideal for 3-4 heads , it has remain a staple for our endless evenings at peter cat.

The Chelo Kebabs, the sizzlers, the starters, the drinks, everything adds to the cuisine that is definitely incredible. I have been going to this place every since I can remember my journey through life. It is a must visit each time that I am in Kolkata.

All excitement was washed away when I tasted the food...It was no more good than what you get in round the corner restaurant at your neighbourhood. ...
It seems that the restaurant is nowhere near the hype created around it....
My advise if you have not yet visited and have heard a lot of good things about the place, don't visit ....otherwise your castle of expectations might fall on its knees...

Enough of homemade delicacies, time to for some restaurants hops where I can find food of best quality. And the restaurant was the well known restaurant Petercat; be it the cozy ambience, dedicated services and excellent food my first choice is surely the Petercat. The restaurant cum bar is marvelous with its menu satisfying your appetite totally. I can‚Äôt simply resist their prawn cocktail as I love prawn the mushy prawns are yummy, I often try it whenever there is a craving to try out something different than the usual chingri macher paturi.¬† With that I often order palak paneer, paneer smitten with palak is one of my fav veg food items. The spicy chicken bharta goes very well with palin pulao, or Persian pulao. The combination is divine. Sometimes for the sake of experimentation I love to eat their mutton badam pasanda which is also a good combo with rice. The golden masala not only makes meat look more appetizing but it truly tastes awesome. To satisfy my taste buds I try their amazing looking tandoori prawns which is heavenly with right combination of salads. Mixed raita is a must to digest the heavy meal and this is also good for the wellbeing of stomach.

My favourite favourite restaurant in Kolkata. Be it for the ambiance, the menu card, the mocktails with super names, the chello kebab or the chicken steak sizzler -- I love all! the best chello kebab you will ever get anywhere. one thing they should definitely lok towrds imporving though is their hospitality during festivals. the waiters sometimes are rude and often even ask the customers to finish early and leave because they have a long queue. this is definitely not done. otehrwise, its Kolkata's heritage restaurant.

Peter Cat !!! What should i write about this place.... Everybody knows the specialty of this restaurant. For me this is a traditional place with good food. They provide mouth watering Chelow Kabab & Sizzlers at a very reasonable price even though this restaurant is situated in Park Street. This is a place for 8 to 80 for almost every occasion. You will always find a queue in front of Peter Cat irrespective of time, but it is surely due to the specialty of this place.

Truly saying there is no negative points about this restaurant and it is known to all.The best item of this restaurant is chelo kabab for me. Sizzler is also good but not better than chelo kabab..

If you are a vegetarian don't even think of going here.. my experience here came after I read good reviews here in zomato.. I ordered their specialty veg chelo kabab n jaljeera.. jaljeera had too much masala and I cudnt drink it.. chelo kebab has paneer tikka, veg kebab, stuffed potato and rice.. all the 4 items when eaten alone are too much fried.. I am from delhi, trust me when I say oily, it's too oily to be eaten.. in fact potato skin had gone so dry due to half cooking in oil that it cudnt be cut by penknife; they cud hav made it crispy, at least that would have helped.. Plus everything s dry so it's a mystery what will u eat extra fried rice with.. I left it half.. N got vegetable club sandwich n finger chips packed with specific instructions that don't put raw tomato in sandwich.. imagine my surprise when I came home to find that sandwich has tomato plus not grilled properly and finger chips are these big logs of potato not even fried properly.. so at the end, I was still hungry after spending 700 INR with lots of non properly cooked oily food in front of me..

Kolkata's renowned PETER CAT has managed to survive both fire and the passage of time. It's warm and dimly lit interior speaks of history. Waiters look resplendent in crisp Rajasthani white and red costumes. I ordered Prawn cocktail and chelo kebab. It is famous for Chelo Kebab: two minced mutton kebab and one chicken kebab served with butter rice and poached egg.

A perfect place with the perfect food.. can't be better.. Their specialities particularly chello kebab and sizzlers stand out.. One having a taste of Peter cat food will surely find it hard to cope up with most of other restaurants in adjoining areas..

I have been to this place several times and I always come out with a big smile and a happy tummy. Classic dishes like chelo kabab and fish muniar will never disappoint you. Be prepared to wait for 15-20 minutes during weekends. But this wait is worth it.

When my siblings asked for a dine out... I got no other place to think of than Peter Cat. The restaurant is quite good with its dim ambiance. The Quality of food is also quite above the mark. Kebab platters and the sizzlers are the most attractive feature of this restaurant. Though we were disappointed by the delay in service time, the overall experience wasn't that bad. Availability of drinks is an extra bonus addition to its exquisiteness. ¬†Recommendation : Chello Kebab

Peter cat! The classic park street kolkata restaurant. 

Peter cat is one of my favorite restaurants from my childhood. 

The best - undoubtedly The legendary Chello kababs. 

Must try - the heavenly sizzlers!

If you are going on a sunday, make sure to prebook your table. 

Long queue of hungry kolkattans await!!! 

Awesome place!

If you live in Kolkata, pride yourself as a food aficionado and haven't been to Peter Cat, then that is something scandalous.¬†Every foodie at some point visits this dimly lit, cozily seated dining place at Park Street. And then they come out a fan.¬†Most importantly Peter Cat's such a safe option. Be it a date, a casual business meeting or hanging out with old friends, you can never go wrong with this place.¬†¬†
The chelo kebab here is legendary. And the house special chicken steak with sausages and liver too is a class apart. Recommended.¬†Among drinks and starters they have a rather good coffee with ice cream. Even in the age of CCD's and hundreds of mushrooming cafes, this tastes different. Among desserts the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce is a treat for your little buddies in the tongue.¬†¬†The waiters are courteous, the service is fast. One of the banes of fame, the place can be crowdy at peak hours and hence getting a seat may take some time. The price is reasonable. A place that justifies its legendary tag. :)

Peter cat is a restaurant with a class of its own. It is my utmost favourite place for sizzlers and kebabs. I have visited this place many times and the feel of this place is always simply amazing. It is spacious, the decor is simple yet classy and the ambience is just lovely. Coming to the food, I have always stuck to their signature dish called the Chelo Kebab. It is the best ensemble dish I have ever tasted. It is impeccable in taste and the kebabs are simply lip smacking. The presentation of this dish is another feature which i absolutely love. Among other food items,I tasted afgani chicken with kabuli naan,which was just delicious. The afgani chicken with its tenderly cooked chicken and the juicy curry is impeccable in taste. However it was during my last visit i tried two of their other specialities,the beckty muniere and the house special sizzler. Needless to say, I was completely blown by their taste too. The beckty muniere together with the sauce and different flavours was outstanding. Its one of the most amazing dish i ever tasted till date!!! The house special sizzler(chicken served with sausages and liver) is tangy and spicy in taste and leaves a long lasting aftertaste. The chicken is juicy and the sausages are moist and tender. In short it is a winner dish. Nothing negative comes to the mind about this restaurant apart from the fact that there is a wait of at least half an hour for getting a seat on weekends. However I have faced this problem just once as most of my other visits were on weekdays. Peter cat is one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata and though I have visited this place many times in past...I will continue to do so in the near future also.

Peter cat has a legacy. It serves the best sizzlers in town. The only thing that might dampen your hunger is the long waiting at peter cat. On an average we have waited for half an hour or more before getting a table at this legendary restaurant. The restaurant has retained its old world charm and has a great ambience. The food is awesome. Off late the prices have been increased but still the food and the experince is worth every penny and every minute spent waiting. Go there for the chelo kababs and the awesome sizzlers.

Forget everything except the food--This is an ideal spot in Park Street to have a relaxing lunch-beautiful Continental, North Indian food with breathtaking.

I can't find another place which is better than this for Chelo Kabab!!! Food was really tasty & absolutely delicious. I am sooooooooo disappointed with this tip system for the waiters, On the other hand manager was very polite, he asked more drinks for us and they are always at your service‚Ä¶ This place gets really high marks for the ambiance, service and of course the delicious traditional food. Highly recommended.

¬†The most outstanding dish was Chelo Kabab including Chicken Tikkka Kabab, Fish Farah, & Peter Cat‚Äôs Special Ice cream, Amazonia(Vodka with Pine Apple juice), Smirnoff  Vodka(HIGH BALLS). We spend many more time together inside the restaurant.

Well, PETER CAT is one of my favourite restaurants. I have been visiting this place since my school days No other words but great ambience, great service and great food. CHELO KEBAB, SIZZLER and SOUFFLE do mesmerize me everytime. Whenever the idea of going out for dinner or lunch strikes me Peter Cat occupies my mind. It is indeed one of the best restaurants in town.

To start with me and my friends wanted to give a treat to our professor from New Delhi. So we went out for lunch. Had to wait a long for a table for 4. Finally after 20minutes we got a table in the top floor corner. We started off with 3 beer and a fresh lime soda. The beer came quick and was adequately chilled. But the turn down was they provided steel mug. Which is personally no no for me. We ordered the famous choke kebab. The quality quantity both were good. Really had a good time until it came to pay the bill.
This big restaurant do not have a wireless credit card punching machine. Had to go down with the waiter to pay. Next came more shocker the waiter stood near the table to look on the tips he is about to get. This behaviour is not expected from a person of this restaurant. So we left not giving any too and the dissatisfaction was clear on this face and body language. Had he not been standing he would have got a tip and a full 5 points for the restaurant. Any ways keeping this aside the place was nice hoping to visit again soon.

4th Oct 2015 Visit. 

It was Sunday afternoon, we two arrived at 2pm. Stood in the queue for 15 minutes. 
We were given seat at the ground floor. Ambiance is always nice in the restaurant. We had 2 ScrewDrivers 2 beer pint, one Iranian chicken kebab, 2 chelo kebab . 
The serving was late back, relaxed quite apt for a Sunday lunch. Had a lovely time 
Definitely a must visit. The improvement I found from my last visit was this time that they now have wireless card punching machine . But the waiters still stands near the table and look out for tips.

It took me a long time, but I finally made my first visit to one of kolkata's must visit during a food pilgrimage. As expected, we had to wait in a line of devotees before we got entry into the place.

We sat in a cosy corner under a brightly lit table. I went ahead and ordered the legendary chello kebab to start of with. I had much expectations due to the hype created around the dish and I will admit it turned quite a surprise for me. It was a nice filling, balanced dish with the subtle basmati rice proving a sidekick to the spicy kebabs. I don't have to tell you to go ahead and try it.

But the other dishes which I ordered were absolutely delightful. Do try the following:

1. Chicken Steak Sizzler: A sizzling surprise with a tender steak and a brilliant sauce

2. Prawn Butter Masala - Yes you heard it right. The tandoori prawn were absolutely brilliant in the tangy gravy.

3.Chicken Afghani - In a light-brown thick cashew gravy, chicken pieces are wonderfully cooked till they are succulent and tender.

4. Shrimp cocktail - A chilled,creamy appetizer of shrimps to get your digestive machinery rolling. Recommended.

5. Beckty Muniere - A brilliant preparation of fish in a creamy butter sauce. I literally closed my eyes in bliss for few seconds to experience all the flavors of the dish. 

The service is also good with the staff helping you to make decisions and customizations if you need any.

This classic restaurant is one of the most loved among all food lovers of Kolkata and you will rarely find someone who has never stepped inside the dimly lit blissful haven for a good meal and drinks. The first thing that makes me elated towards this restaurant is their drinks menu which depicts a different candid personification for every cocktail or mocktail available and its fun to browse through the booklet even if you end up having beer or rum. The chelo kebab is an all time favourite and so are all the chicken steak based sizzlers. Though im not a great fan of the icecream and coke cocktail i would definitely go back there for the 'n'th time to try its mughlai cuisine (which I've heard is good)..all in all a restaurant that can never disappoint you.. ????

Disgusting management, extremely rude and a total chaos when it comes to seating people. the order is supposed to be 'first come first served' but sadly this is not followed as there are others (same number of people) who arrive late but get a table faster and when the person in charge is asked, he says this place is not suitable for women! there is no demarcation zone in any restaurant in the world designating which tables are 'women friendly'. moreover, if u are white skinned then u are put at the head of the queue (as if the westerners would pay more than we indians!) extremely racist and the chello kebab is not the true iranian chello kebab horrible staff!

Amazing ambience 
The staff is good 
I started with virgin Mary which tasted pretty amazing so I expect all the mocktails to be good 
The Indian tandoori starters are really tasty specially tandoori chicken and chicken tikka 
The Indian gravy like kadhai chicken is good too, the gravy tastes really good 
The main attraction is the mutton chello kebab which has a combination of kebabs, rice with butter and half fried omelette on it, its pretty heavy and very tasty
The desserts are good too
Overall 
The food is good 
Ambience is good 
Staff is good 
A little heavy on the pocket but worth it .

I adore Peter Cat. The staff are regal, yet friendly (deferential, even, depending on their mood), and the interiors are charming. Despite the low lighting, table lamps, and 60's thick velvet curtains, this place doesn't have either a pretentious feel, or the gently decaying air of old colonial eating houses.¬†

Then there's the food. Absolutely wonderful food! Nearly everything on the menu is great, but first-timers must really try at least a few of the following:¬†
1. Chicken mayo salad - a rich, creamy, mayonnaise-y salad made of LOTS of diced steamed vegetables covered by a dome of thinly-sliced roast chicken covered in house-made mayonnaise. Eat this with a dinner roll.

2. All forms of fried fish,

3. Dum-ki-raan (slow-cooked leg of lamb), which, if you're a moderate eater, you should only order half of.¬†

4. The fish makhmali, the shah nauz, the sizzler platters, and of course, the chello kaba plate, if only for experience's sake. It's not their best dish, but it's certainly the best known.

Tip decently if you like the service. These gentlemen tend to remember faces, and given how reasonable the prices are, and how good the food, the people who work at this place have certainly earned those extra bucks. ¬†Also, arrive at least an hour before you intend to eat. Even on regular non-holidays and during non-lunch/non-dinner hours, Peter Cat will usually have a queue thirty people deep ahead of you at the door.

Hello, Peter cat! One of the most legendary place to exist in Calcutta. You are a non-Calcuttian, come here for a lunch or dinner experience! Getting a table without waiting for a considerable amount of time is almost impossible! You got at 4 in the evening, you still wait for 15-20 minutes to get a seat.¬†

I have come here with my family everytime and I am moderately happy to eat at this place everytime. I am not enthralled and blown away by the quality of the food here. However, I like the little orange lights, and the romantic atmosphere that it creates which is obviously broken by the constant chatter around the restaurant. Blame me! I like a very silent restaurant. The most famous dish of this place, the Chello kebab is usually what every mortal present in the restaurant orders. So, I kind of do the same. The best thing about the Chello kebab is the butter rice and the Reshmi chicken kebabs. The combination of them both makes life wonderful. However, I absolutely detest the mutton sheekh kebab. Sorry, loyal fans! But I cannot help it. And I also don't get the significance of the huge tomato that is always provided with the rice. Probably it has it's own sweet significance, but I personally do not like it. Apart from the Chello, once ordered Chicken steak. The chicken steak is just a moderate tasting steak. I didn't once drool all over the food here. There are loyal Peter Cat-ians, but I am not one of them. Sorry!

Positives: Ambiance which is quite romantic, The cute cat menu card and the legend that they have created with Chello kebab, the taste, the price.
Negatives: The wait, oh I could kill people after waiting for nearly 30 minutes or more, the over-hype ¬†of the place.

I would come back here, yes. Why not? I like the Chello kebab as well! But I am not the loyalist of this place. Peter Cat elitists, don't kill me!

One of my favourite restaurants in the culinary paradise of India, it is located in a prime location and is an easy spot. Exceptional ambience topped with classic service is what best describes this restaurant. The famous Chelo Kebabs always live up to their legacy. Although their speciality is the Sizzler, although not an Indian dish this is cooked in an elegant way using wine and that cracking noise of the sizzler get your saliva and digestive juices flowing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality gastronomical experience.

Peter Cat is one of the legendary names when it comes to dining out in Kolkata,to be more specific, Park Street.True to it's legend, it mesmerizes you with it's ambience and beautiful interiors.We waited for around 30 mins before we could get a seat.
I tried their famous signature dish, the chelo kebab.It was good and by the time me and my friends finished the platter, we were full.Its quite filling.Yes,the prices are bit on the higher side,but worth the experience.
Do visit this place once and you'll love it for sure.. :)

This place is well known for its delicious sizzlers. I tried the chicken steak and chelo kebabs. I liked them both. The disappointing thing about this place is that it is hard to get an empty table (we had to wait for 30 mins) on weekends. Ambience is okay (could have been a bit better). Visit this place only if you're ready to spend that extra penny as prices are a bit high. I would highly recommend you guys to visit this place for the sizzlers!!

I have visited this place since childhood and its been more than a couple of decades and am still in love. If I critically analyze though, the quality has gone down a wee bit over the years or maybe its just me who has gotten so used to it that it feels a tad less special now. Who knows !!! :)

Had lots of high hopes for this restaurant,  bit when i dropped in on 1st January and really there was barely any continental on the menu and all the food was spicy and really spicy no dish was without spice. 
And the time taken for serving was also a bit on the higher side. 
I would suggest Mocambo over Peter Cat.

Well well...!! This legendary restro needs no intro... Went there today for lunch at around 12:30 pm.. It was crowded and we have to wait for around 40mins to go in
Ambience- perfect. Dim lighted but a bit crowdy.. We cant blame that though.
Food- well there is nothing new i cn say about food.. We ordered grilled fish sizzler and it was yummy. How could we miss the famous chelo kebabs. Not only it was tasty but also a heavy dish. I liked the chicken kebab more.
Pocket pinch- on a bit higher side. Bur given their quality and quantity, the price is justified. It is around 1200 for 2 in average.
Definitely recommended.

On a cold festive december evening I headed out to dine at peter cat knowing the fact that I would need to wait endlessly for a table. My sister and her husband had flown in from the states and they wanted to have their favourite chelo kebabs and sizzlers.

After about an hour's wait outside we were taken to our table. Hungry like bulls we ordered food and booze straightaway. So hungry were we that we polished off the accompaniments that come with the booze instantly.

The soup (we ordered cream of chicken) for the kids arrived in 10 minutes. It was rather bland. The chelo kebab and the mixed grill sizzlers were served in another 15 minutes while we gulped down the booze. The chelo kebab was amazing. I do not have words to describe how awesome it was. The mixed grill sizzler arrived next and it was prepared Indian style. Perhaps in a hurry we had chosen the tandoori one. Never mind. It tasted pretty good with generous portions of chicken, fish, liver, mutton and egg all marinated with indian paste and grilled. The mutton was soft and was nice to dig into! The sizzlers were heavy needless to say. Too full we were that we did not try deserts.

Awesome food at an awesome place. Only if you have the patience to stand in long queues even on a monday evening!

The afternoon of my one day stopover in Kolkata and after an epic but much less than perfect breakfast ( look up my review of Flury's to understand this contradiction ) the park area legend " Flury's " I was determined to discover some great food. I had actually spend the two and a half hour after my breakfast scouting for a place to have lunch. 
Wandering around the streets at around one on a Monday afternoon , in a lane just off Flury's on the park street  , I was confronted by what looked like a mini mob , waiting outside to be admitted to this strangely named establishment "Peter Cat " . 

Assuming , so many people , most locals , would certainly know where to find good food , even I joined that crowd. Being a solo diner can have certain privileges at times , in a very little time I was lead to a table by very professional but bored looking floor manager. By the way , throughout my excellent dining experience , that was one common thread it all the employes there , very efficient, refilling water after every sip   I took from my glass , replacing the table linen and silver as soon as required but utterly bored , this was further illustrated by there converting my table , a small two seater just by the staircase , into an instant service bay , wether a table nearby wanted an extra fork or some black pepper , they instantly provided it to them by taking it off my table and when one of them was left with some spare napkins after setting up a table he just dumped them there and all this without even glancing at me :). I guess they know that the patrons come here just for the foods and such finer details can be overlooked , at least on a table seating just a lone non demanding dinner .

Now the decor , the carpet was well worn , the seats reasonably comfortable though cramped , the lighting low and the ambiance just nicely neutral , no statements there . 

But the statements started with there menus . The cocktail menu first , it is a nice longish booklet with real catchy names and great caricatures , just looking at them puts you in a mood to have a drink :) but I resisted the temptation and went straight for the food menu , shaped like a , you guessed  it right , cat :) , loads of choices here and I was totally at sea , so I decided to order a dish I knew nothing about , The Chello Kabab and that turned out to be the best decision of the day. Buttered rice , cooked  al dente , topped with a sunny side up , a boiled tomato and dollops of butter , with a lamb sheekh Kabab and a chicken tikka with grilled onions off the skewer on the side , a picture of culinary paradise. My only disappointment after eating this dish was that It was so filling that after eating it there was no scope for me to eat anything else and discover some more hidden gems from the menu . Utterly delicious. 

So before the final word , a thought , in course of reviewing all these restaurants It appears as if I am turning into some kind of a food snob spinning long tales but to me it is sharing my experience in totality and the only reason for criticising is to make these already nice places , nicer and the reviews more fun and informative to read. 

Ok , so will I go back and recommend the "Peter Cat ' ? and the answer is a big YES to both the questions. Not to be missed 

Enjoy.

Well known for Sizzlers..... but if you do not know the table manners, the waiters wont even come to you asking for your order... however, you need to be a bit careful while choosing this one as the fire dafety guidelines are out dated... anyways, a so so place to hang out....

The place is crowded, low on light and you always have to keep waiting to get a table... But the waiting is worth every second once you taste their food. Continental and Indian are both beautifully cooked. The sizzlers, chelo kebab and Dum-ki-Raan are a few you must try if you are a tourist (regulars know the menu by heart). So next time you plan to dine at Park Street waiting for a table at the legendary Peter Cat should be there on your list.

Famous for its chelo kebab, truly a legendary destination for all foodies of Kolkata. You have to wait in queue to get inside the restaurant if you had not reserved your seat.¬†
I visited to this outlet quite a few times and tasted their chelo kebab, al-a-nawabi-biriyani, chicken steak sizzler and a few mocktails. All of their items were very good in taste. Dim lighted decor is also very nice.
The food items are slightly over-priced; but mark my word..you will never get such a tasty food in anywhere else in Kolkata!!

We ordered chelo kebab which at first sight looks like you can eat it all easily but when you dig in you will realise the quantity is just eye wash its really tough to eat all unless you have empty stomach. ¬†Ambience is very cosy. Staffs are good. The menu card its a shape of a head of a cat that's very cool it goes with the name.

Undoubtedly a legendary  destination for foodies,which is famous not only in Kolkata but to gourmets all over india .
Even on weekdays one has to wait in queue for getting inside during lunch and dinner hours.
The dimly lit inside aggravates my hunger:)
The famous chelo kebab is no doubt good. But I like their sizzlers too.
The mocktails are nice.
Price is slightly on the higher side,but we don't mind spending money after having quality food with our close ones at such a nice place.

Visited peter cat first time.It was good.Ambiance is nice .one thing ..need to be noted is that..timing ;) try to reach there before 6:30 pm.evening as they have 15 16 people on waiting after 7 7:30;).so be on time.We reached there at 6:30,even then place was so crowed.We got the place on the first floor :p
Coming to food,we ordered chicken sizzlers and Cheli kebabs(peter cat's special).. Both were yummy.Price is quite okay.Must visit .Don't forget to have chello kebab ;)

Second time,visited this place,had chello kebabs again ;).This time,we tried two new things, prawn cocktail and grilled fish sizzlers.First let me tell you,Prawn cocktail is NOT a cocktail ,its a dish.Prawn in mayonnaisse sauce.It was good.Grilled fish was also yummy .Enjoyed the ambiance.:)

The welcome, however at the door during lunchtime left something to be desired - however once we entered the dark dimly lit ambience and were ferried upstairs, it seemed like we were becoming part of an old Agatha Christie plot.

The Chello kebab was mouthwatering and worthy of its 'signature dish' status. I also tried the chilli chicken (which for a guy that is not that into chilli could be akin to dancing with the devil) and it was fabulously delicious.

A fair priced meal for the quality you receive.

Peter Cat, a name synonymous with every Calcuttan. Its a symbol of heritage and a must visit in the list of every foodie. The cue in front of Peter Cat can never go unnoticed  whenever one visits Park Street. After a significant wait you are welcmed into a dimly lit hall filled with the chitter-chatter of people,the crackling sounds of the sizzlers and the mixed aroma of the burnt butter with that of the liqour. The whole ambience just takes you back in time.
About the food, the must try would be the all famous chello kabab and the various sizzlers. Also if you are not a Continental food lover then they have the biriyani and other indian dishes to offer. The food is quite good but a little too pricey.

The Chello Kebab at Peter Cat never gets old. Well, If you are an outsider you know Peter Cat by that one iconic dish. well suggested by local folks,¬†honestly speaking ...its just a plate of 2 sheekh kebab,rice, a dollop of butter and few vegetables... ¬†Yet the taste stood upto expectation bt quantity certainly will disappoints you.Same goes with other fish kebabs , prawn tandoori kebabs that we ordered.With 70's ambiance and beer served in brass mug. Do not expect any thing more than basic on the service front. Please have sufficient time in hand if you are going to Peter Cat. Expect to be on a waiting list if you land up during lunch hours on week ends. ¬†The waiters will annoy you by presenting the bill even before you ask them. , personally they ask for tips.

Legendary and Sizzlers. These are the two terms that come to mind when you think of peter cat. Every self respecting resident in the city would have visited this institution atleast once and while food is definitely good, the place is not and the service apathetic. As long as you're going to eat without bothering about your surroundings, smell, decor and service, you're fine. Else don't bother.

Actually whenever I am here, had to wait at least 30-40 min before getting a table. But it's worth the wait. Service is always good with a old world charm, including the turban clad servers.

The most disappointing restaurant I've ever been to. This was one of the most hyped place in kolkata. I'm from Mumbai and I was here for good food. Reading the reviews and looking at the place from outside and from the kind of people visiting this place, I had high expectations and those expectations were completely shattered. Starting with the amount of waiting time. Ok good restaurants have waiting which in a way says that the place is good the food is good and people are willing to wait an hour to eat.The food was moderately priced but the quality of the food was monstrous. We ordered tandoori chicken and the so called legendary sizzlers. The sizzler had kababs and they were pathetic. I ordered for salad. They served me onions on top of carrots and charged 66 bucks for onions and carrots which were dry. They served the pineapple juice when we were done with our main course. We had to constantly tell the waiter to serve water. Things weren't going good as it is I went to the washroom and saw that there was a freaking queue to pee. There was a person guarding the door And people are literally waiting for the person to open the door and allow them to pee. I was waiting outside the washroom and the kitchen door was right beside me. Waiters constantly going in and out. The place was congested. It was suffocative and we had to tell them to switch on the AC. Food was served in cheap steel plates. Untimely service. Disastrous food. I suggest its not a good place to go. Wait an hour then getting this. Nothing worked. Supremely disappointed

I enjoyed the food, I got one of the "specials" which was served as a sizzler, which I didn't expect. I might have overlooked it on the menu. 
The general decor of Peter cat is great and the dim lighting reminds me of a pub. It's not to say that the rest of the place in any way reminds me of a pub though. 
The prices are fine and the staff is great, they didn't intrude to much but didn't hold back so I felt I had to struggle to get the attention of them when needed. 

Bring a couple of friends here for a midweek dinner, but please put your mobile on silent.

But let me tell you that they have the WORST SERVICE EVER ... Being a person belonging to the Customer Service world i can myself gauge that ... The WAITERS are so ARROGANT and they don't even apologize if its late ... In one word "A Bunch Of ********" ...

1.Ambience-great,low lighting condition,have a bar like feel...great to romance with your better half.
2.Food-great from kebabs to mocktail all are equally good.
3.Service-I generally visit this one once a month..its service was great but now it seems detoriating;(
4.Price-very reasonable...we will have a full course meal with ur partner at around 1200rs.
Chelo kebab and sizzlers are must pick there.

I was in Kolkata for a few days and my colleague took us here for lunch. I wanted to have biryani but he was quite keen on this place.
We, of course, ordered chelo kebab. I did not know what it is and was pleasantly surprised- 2 kebabs- mutton and chicken were served with rice, butter and fried egg. I kept the egg aside and devoured the rest of it. The mutton kebab was ok... the chicken one was ok and this was the first time I was eating rice with butter in it.
We had brownie with ice creams which was good. All in all, a good place and a popular one too. We had to wait 15 mins for a table on a weekday afternoon.

Peter Cat is synonymous with old "KOLKATA" charm.The royal turbans on the guards heads are so regal at the start to begin with at the entrance door.The high ceilings and lovely old world decor adds taste to the food. Unique is their "Chelo Kababs".The only thing that differentiates Peter Cat from the other traditional Park Street dine outs is the "Chelo Kabab". A must dish to order with other accompaniments. A predominantly continental & indian cuisine, with all traditional dishes.  :) :)

yes the chelo kebab really is all that. try it, its surprisingly good.The thing about this place is that it's the bedrock of restauranting in Kolkata. In other words it's consistent, the manager is great, food comes as ordered and on time, and no hassles. it really is great to actually go out and relax. avoid the minestrone soup, actually avoid all the soups! also avoid everything with cheese if you're not a fan of runny white cheese sauce. otherwise good to go!

Peter Cat is more like Peter Crap. How does this like place come up on top of the Zomato Kolkata listings on the strength of that one thing, chelo kebabs? On one occasion, I was served fish and chips at Peter Cat in which the fish was unsalted and soggy and the chips were so stale they could have been the previous day's. The steward was unbelievably rude - telling me, "This is how we make it. You're the only one who doesn't like it." Like a fool, I paid for this garbage, unwilling to upset the farewell dinner for which we had gone there. The next time I went to Peter Cat - at the insistence of a friend - we were both sick immediately after the dinner. She ran to the restaurant loo to throw up; I managed to hold it until I reached home. It's amazing how any shit sells in India, because we're an overpopulated country and there are takers for everything, no matter how sub-standard.

Have been following this joint for decades. Right in the middle of Park Street nothing  has changed in terms of ambience and taste. Their Chelo Kebabs are the best.

The holy grail for foodies on park Street. Winning kbc is a cake walk and easier than getting a table during puja season. Chelo kebab and beer in a silver mug is a blockbuster of a combination.  Prawn cocktail is the best in town.  Sizzlers are awesome too.....more or less it's an institution with dedicated followers!!!!

The evening spend at peter cat was great, except the service which was sloppy on many occasions.... The interior, decor and feel of the place is great... Though a bit on the expensive side, but the dishes are great... And their speciality the chelo kabab platter is great... An good overall experience can be expected from this place... But the tables can be more lavishly decorated instead of the minimalistic approach adopted...

When you ask your Kolkata based freinds for good places to eat,peter catfeatures on almost everyone's list.
And as soon as someone says Peter Cat the words Chello Kebabs follow,you instantly know that this is a legendary grub spot you can't miss.
So me and my friend landed there one week night and were lucky just to be there before the line started.
We had beer in the famous brass mugs which gave us a Game of Thrones like feeling and waited patiently for the Chello Kebabs.
After around 10 mins a king size platter with 2 different kebabs,rice and a fried egg arrived.The sight was a little confusing at first but once i started to dig in the confusions just vanished.
All the components just worked out perfectly to give a awesome tasting experience.
The ambience and the service was just fine to please the patrons.
Will definately recommend peter cat and chello kebabs to anyone who happens to be in Kolkata

Name anyone, who hasn't been to Peter Cat? If not, then please go right after you have read my review. They are famous for their chelo kababs and sizzlers. It reminds me of the sound "zzzzz", like those rattlesnakes.

They serve alcohol. I had my first Bloody Mary here. :p It is 'densely populated', as the crowd is always heavy and you would see a huge queue right in front of Peter Cat. Getting inside without waiting....you need to be really lucky. Since the place is little crowded, one would hear buzzing sound besides the sound of the cutlery. They make some real good delicacies for vegetarians and for fish lovers. Good combination of chicken and mutton liver. :)
Oh! I feel myself hungry now. :(
They have some special kababs everyday and each day is a different one. 
People who wants to visit there for the first time, a suggestion, please be prepared to wait but don't give up.

I love every part of you. From the white table cloth to the hanging red lights. From the broad stairway to the red carpet. I am never bored of the chelo kebab or the cold chicken salad. Mixed grill, house special and chicken steak are my favorites. I love the fish fingers and matar paneer too. Tuti Fruti has always been my favorite dessert. I have visited you over 100 times and I will very soon see you again. ‚ô• You have always been one of my top favorites. Its just the washroom here that I don't like, the only reason why I am rating you one point less. Otherwise full marks from my side :)

My mom has a crave for Sizzlers... So, we went to this restaurant. Having been to most of the sizzlers' restaurant like Yoko's, Kobe's and Yana's in Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore, we were quite disappointed with the recipe used here. Neither do they have different sauces like Garlic, Pepper or Mushroom nor do they have much vegetables with the dish. Mostly the vegetables varies from sauteed spinach, peas, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, carrots, tomatoes, onions assorted with potato fries in all other places where we had sizzlers. Here every damn thing was boiled and tossed in sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. Although the chelo kebab was really good.

In my list this is the one of the best restaurants one could ask for in Kolkata. Not only it has great food especially the chello kebabs and the sizzlers in the menu but also this place has got a great ambience and wonderful service. I'm a very regular visitor of this restaurant. My recommendation is to try out the house special sizzler and the mutton chello kebab(which I think is even better than the chicken)

Nice Dark ambience with lights on top of the tables, Ordered the Rajma Kebab- Okok, I would say. Main course: Chelo kebab, Paneer makhan masala, malai kofta, Lasooni nan, roti. Everything was perfectly cooked, tasted awesome. :)Liked it very much, eagerly waiting for the next visit so that can have platter :P. Must visit once.

Step1: Come here during peak meal time only if you are willing and have the patience to wait in line for your table.
Step2: Be amazed at the elegant ambience of an old calcutta charm. Also notice the uniform of your waiter and their gracious manner and feel special.
Step3: Order your food, most recommended the famous authentic kebab. I've tried their biryani, navratna, fried liver and many more, never to be disappointed.
Step4: Chat away with your company and wait eagerly for your food and enjoy the restaurant ambience.
Step5: Gorge down your food as soon as it comes cause you cant wait to dig in. Reason why I ve no pictures of it despite being here uncountable number of times.
Step4: Be content with the quick service, courteous staff and most importantly the food, and happily be off!
Edit: It was chelo kebabs and pictures are attached below!

The Chelo kebab here makes 'Peter cat' famous.
The food no doubt is delicious.
If you want hard drinks, please make sure that you carry an identity card. If it's a group then each one of u who wants to drink should carry their identity card. I faced a lot of problem because my friends did not carry an identity proof, so we had to drop the plan of boozing.
Overall... It's a good place to dine in with family and friends...

This review was long due as I have been going to this joint since as long as I can remember way back into my childhood and no matter how many fancy joints pop up in Kolkata, this place has really stood the test of time. Chelo Kebabs and Sizzlers, nothing to really say about them as they have been every Kolkatan's all time favorites. But what I really like about this place is its ambience. There seems to be that certain air of colonial era which still exists and makes you nostalgic to think about the old 1960s Kolkata. Among the hustle and bustle of the crowd there still exists a certain serenity and you can still find a cozy corner in this dimly lit joint.¬†

Chelo kebab is the obvious choice, although the quality of the food has dropped significantly from the past. The sizzler is better than Mocambo's and the vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate is a must. The taste hot chocolate, served in a brass container, is unlike any other.

I had heard a lot of good reviews and feedbacks of Peter Cat and its Chelo Kebabs and Sizzlers from my friends. But once I visited the place myself, I must say I was a bit disappointed.
The ambience was excellent. I ordered a Chicken Chelo Kebab .... It was really good dish , as the reviews said. But when I compared it to the price, I did not think the cost was justified. You can get better quality and quantity of foods in some other restaurants if you spend same amount of money.
And the service .... it was really not up to the mark. The service might not matter to some people , specially those who are regulars and used to it. But I felt very much annoyed the way the waiter hurried to get my card for bill payment and kept on standing there....... or the way he kept on waiting before us pointing the bill-book for tips !!! Generally I expect the waiter to leave the bill at our table and collect it by coming back after a couple of minutes and then collect the tips once we leave the table, but may be the Peter Cat waiters were not comfortable with the idea.
I rate Peter Cat 3.5 only for the ambience and food, as the service gets only 1.5 from me..

The service is the point on which they really need to focus.. Some of the stuffs were really not up to the mark.. Otherwise this restrau provides a nice experience.

Fortunately we didnt have to wait to get a table this time. it was about 2pm and i was famished. we quickly seated ourselves and ordered chelo kababs and House special sizzlers with dinner rolls.¬†Waiters are nice and courteous. ¬†the hanging lamps make a unique atmosphere which we wont get anywhere else. tables are too closely placed few people may find it intimidating.¬†the place is filled with smoke coming out of sizzlers.¬†beware if you r too too close to the sizzler plate then you will ruin you dress because of the oil sputtering out of the plate.¬†there's nothing new to say about chelo kebab. i love the chicken kebab the most.¬†the sizzler had two flatten pieces of coated chicken, 2 small chicken liver pieces and two little sausages. loved the sausages. the gravy was tasty and the potatoes and other veggies were nicely done. dinner rolls were served with butter. dinner role + butter + sizzler = full to the brim.¬†had an lovely experience that day. everything was fresh and met all our expectations!

I DID NOT like the quality of the food that was being delivered..the chelo kebab had some fish rolls which were grainy and the dish itself was super oily..the sizzler had a weird tasting chicken breast with a thick coating of flour... lastly...the tutty fruity..which I was looking forward to did not have any fruit except for raw papaya...honestly I might go back if friends insist...or else it wont ever be my first choice again!

I know today that if I need a sizzler the only place in town that I would go to is Peter Cat.
The house special sizzler has touched my hart as much as it has touched my mind. The price is reasonable and service is also good although the ambiance could have been better and the people eating in the lower floor are not as comfortable as they are on the upper floor, it lakes much space.
Over all the food and the service was good and I know that I will be going back there soon.

I loved the Chelo Kebab when I was still eating meat. So, very soon UNESCO might give it heritage status if we all start a change.org petition ( I am kidding , but it seems like an idea worth trying). 

Now, that I am a vegetarian I find ghaas-phoos options are limited in restaurants and PC is not an exception.  So, I find myself ordering Veg Mixed Grill every time , while my partner orders Biryani Nayantara and Veg Begumbahar. 

I remember having Chilli Baby corn and Russian Salad one day , but they weren't as good as the Veg Mixed Grill. 

The ambiance is good for family dinners, also for people who like to have a quiet meal by themselves.

Well, about service I can say that it can range from very good to very bad. 

As you will always find a queue after 7 at PC,so try to book in advance or get a book to read in the portico.

A brand which needs no special mention. Hurry up if you haven't visited.¬†

A place where you get the right value for money. The uncountable visits have always been dominated by Chelo Kebabs and Chicken/Fish Steak Sizzlers. The aroma of the spices, condiments and herbs are something which you would like to preserve in your kitchen. Prawn Cocktail is a wonderful drink to start of with if you want to discover a tangy tinge amalgamated with fresh prawns. My favourite is Planter's Punch though. Despite being an avid lover of Chicken, Fish Makhmali truly touched my heart. To be on the safer side, carry Rs 1000 in your wallet for an individual.

Not a new member to peter cat.. I guess a time was there when it turned out to be my regular home :p lol jokes apart. First time after struggling over a long queue which I guess is one of the speciality of Peter cat we were able to enter ;) I entirely love the set up of lights , soft music and properly uniformed waiters. Won't b adding something new but it provides one of the best sizzlers in town. "House special sizzlers" is one of my favourite's. If one wants to have a legendary platter he should surely go for "Chelo kebab"( a special dish of chicken kebabs served with steamed rice, butter and egg poach)  .. I m under short of words to explain the heavenly taste. A perfect place to hangout with loved ones, friends , family etc . Don't miss out !!!

Heard a lot about this place, so my expectations were high but it turned out to be a damp squib. The menu looks innovative but the food dished out is average to say the least. Ordered for coupe of sizzlers n few starters but specially the sizzlers were Indianised n there was nothing authentic bout it. Specially in a place like Calcutta which I consider as the food capital of India, it's definitely short of expected standards.  Drinks menu looked good though,  but I didn't try any to review them. Can definitely do better!!

What should I write about this place that Calcutta does not know already?!
This is one place that you'd come to again and again no matter what. True, the service is pathetic but the food! Oh the food!
The chelo kebabs, the sizzlers (my favourite is the mixed grill), the innovative drinks (read: the drinks menu), the lighting - everything is a sheer delight.
I have always come here for its chelo platter or the sizzlers. I don't even touch anything else on the menu. Those are the only things I crave for when I come to Peter Cat.
I think I've been here more number of times than any other restaurant and only because of its food. I never get tired of it. And I suppose it is the case with most Calcuttans or otherwise one wouldn't notice a tail of people outside the resto every other day!

Park Street‚Äôs Peter Cat is not only about good food, the overall ambience of the restaurant is cozy and comforting. While enjoying their food you will simply wow their overall servicing. I had heard about the place from many and when went there for the first time really got marveled by their delicacies. Every time I go there I try to taste different items of their menu. They have meticulously chosen each and every item on their platter. The place is known for its top services and off course delicious food. Last time when I was there ordered mutton shammi kabab and tandoori aloo. Both the items were awesome the kabab with all its masala was simply tasty and tandoori aloo was mouth watering. My friends ordered malai kofta and palak paneer and as their facial expression was, it was yummy. Then came chicken fried rice with that we had chicken bharta and chicken curry. Chicken items complemented rice very well. As all of us love fish we ordered fish curry, the gravy of the curry melted well in the mouth. We then came to the salad items and chose fresh salad. Lastly we had tutti fruitti and cr√®me caramel. The full meal was simply satisfactory and fulfilling.

Chelo Kabab and Biryani Ala Nawabi and some mutton preperation that i dont remember . It was my birthday this year and i was at this place after a long time. Had my drinks before from some other place so i just plunged into food as soon as i entered. I was lucky this time as i didn't had to stand in a never ending line as the place was not full. Hovering over the whole menu we decided for the abovementioned preperations as two of them could vary but chelo kabab has always been a plate to order when ever i am there. 
The food came and as always was good and we enjoyed it a lot.
You will love the low light decor there and the staffs are always ready to help you.
A must visit place if you r a true kolkatan. Its a heritage.

However the service is prompt. We ordered Chello Kabab and a House Special Sizzler. The Sizzler tasted pretty good.  The kababs tasted normal.  The sausages with the kabab had nothing special to offer but the butter on the rice with the egg was the unique and best part. Overall a 4.5 for food,  4 for decor,  and a 4 for taste.

Ever since I am studying in Kolkata I had an absolute crave to visit this place. One has to wait a bit to get a bit before getting a table, but it definetly is worth the wait. With the mordern hanging lamps, the 70's style staircase, the beautifully decorated tables, it has an excellent ambience. Best known for chelo kababs, i had ordered Chicken Irani kebabs for the appetizer, and Butter nun and chicken bharta for the main course. Must say, the kebabs are simply mouth watering and certainly one of the best kebabs i have ever tasted. The chicken bharta was also quite good. Overall, a 4.0 rating for Peter Cat.

This place symbolizes the typical Park street restaurant.Beautiful ambiance-dim light atmosphere and lots of space in the restaurant where you can get a table and enjoy your time with your friends or family.Food-Its mainly famous for its Chelo Kebab,I first had it in my college days with my friends and I loved it specially the pieces of chicken Kebab,which were very tender.
Next time I tried the Sizzler which was astonishingly very good and also the Indian food collection in this place are also good and if you want a good dessert to end the meal then you can try the warm Brownie with Vanilla and chocolate sauce.If you want some quiet moment after the office hours or some nice moment with friends over drinks,then it can be the place as this place offers some good collection of alcohol,with that Chelo Kabab by side that will be a soothing time pass. In festive season or on weekends it is very difficult to get a table if you didn't booked in advance.The service was really good.
It is still one of the must go destination in Park street.I will recommend this place to others,go and have a slice of the famous Chelo Kebab and relive some old Park Street.

A classic restaurant with a colonial environment. Food was good and ya the chello kabab was fine in blend and combo. Good to rich your date with a sizzler and some booze.

Like Calcutta.. This place is the synonym for old charm that defines the city.  My first tryst with this place was in college when a couple of friends pooled money for a taste of our first chelo kebab. Back then it costed us a mini fortune of 125 per plate. A decade later,whenever I am in the city this place is a must in my to do list.  Frankly speaking I have never ever seen the complete menu because I skip to 1 plate chelo kebab and 1 thums up. Believe me when I tell you it is indescribable and unforgettable.  Combined with the decor and ambience the time to wait and finally savor this ecstasy and then ruminate the lingering taste till you finally exit the premises is indeed an otherworldly experience.

A place like Peter Cat needs no such reviews. It was my first time there. As recommended by all, chelo kebabs were what I had ordered. The rice was great and the quantity enough. Just a thing, which is they should buck up their service which is a bit sloppy. The desserts are must-have, especially the warm brownie, which is a chocolate lover's heaven, with a hot chocolate sauce!

This ParkStreet heritage needs no introduction.  While some may say the huge queues in front of it in often a publicity stunt but no This resturant does remain packed up all the time. One of my personal favourite is the prawn cocktail. It might be a bit tangy for some pallete, it tastes just as good to me. Low lighting and an old get-up interior decor definitely sets the mood. The sizzlers are worth every penny , chicken tikka sizzler all the worth of a special mention. Try the chicken marrakesh as well. And who hasn't tasted their Chello-Kebabs. Well if you havnt yet, your loss.

Ever since I am studying in Kolkata I've heard so much about Peter Cat.I had an absolute craving to visit this place.And as luck holds I got a chance to be here with my team of college mates.We were celebrating the success of an event.We were given an entire dining space in the ground floor where 26 of us could comfortably sit!!
The ambience is superb.The beautifully decorated tables and those lights are awesome.We went for the famous Chelo Kebabs and Chicken steak Sizzlers.
Personally I preferred the Sizzlers over the Chelo Kebabs.Although the Rice with Chelo Kebab was nice with dollop of butter but the my taste buds couldnt actually relish the chelos!
I would have certainly given a 3.5 but 0.5 extra for the feel and lighting!
The only con it suffers from is one has to wait for a long time outside before getting a table.The situation worsens on Sundays!

Located at the heart of Park street on the first right turn from where the Music World usee to be, is the legendary Peter cat. Entering the restaurant, the 70's style d√©cor, the dim light and the music will catch your attention. The ambiance inside the restaurant is awesome. Coming to food, everybody must have heard about the Chello kebab of peter cat, which is very delicious, though the standards of the chello kebab has downgraded a little bit on the last two times I visited there from the high standards they set. But apart from Chello kebab, steak, sizzlers and other dishes are equally delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the service is pretty quick too. So if you haven't gone there yet then you must go there this weekend, and the ones who have gone there once, is a regular after that.

Another legendary and evergreen restaurant in the heart of parkstreet. Who doesn't knows the legacy and rich history of "Peter Cat". It is owned by Nitin Kothari, who is the owner of "Mocambo" as well. I am visiting this place for years now.  I was in kindergarden when i visited this place for the first time with my father. The decor and the attire of the waiters has a vivid similarity with that of Mocambo. But Peter Cat has its own identitiy and distinction cause of its  deligent hospitality and commitment towards quality offerings. I was introduced to "sizzlers" by my parents at this place and since then i never had a second thought of enjoying my plate of sizzler at some place else. Though they offer both north indian and continental cuisines but it is the north indian delicacies in which they specializes in. From the experience which i have gained after visiting this place for years their dishes which according to me stand out in the crowd are - chicken steak sizzler, grilled fish, chello kababs etc. These are the few dishes which you cannot think of eating any where else than Peter Cat. The uncompromising quality, unbeatable hospitality and the never changing ambience cements the legacy of Peter Cat in everyone's heart.

Location: the Legendary Peter Cat is famous in Park Street, Kolkata. It is located on the street which leads to Loreto Collage and is right behind Flury‚Äôs and erstwhile Music World. On Weekends Peter cat become the most crowded restaurant. so you would have to wait for minimum half an hour for your turn. But i feel its worth waiting. you might have some problem in parking your Car on weekends but weekdays car parking is easily available.

Description: It is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata who still has maintained its charm, Pride and Reputation. It takes you to a different era as you enter Peter cat.¬†

D√©cor/interior/ Ambiance: You might feel that you have entered into the 70‚Äôs era as you step into Peter cat. The dim lights, low music, tall raj-style dressed waiters, red carpet, comfortable sofas and sitting arrangements make the ambiance perfect.   

Food ordered: I had ordered their famous Chelo Kabab (the Original)

Food experience: The Chelo Kabab platter comes with 2 types of Kabab, Rice with Butter, Poached Egg. The taste is awesome and very much different from any other Chelo Kabab from other restaurants. They donot compromise on the quality as well as the quantity of the food. The kabab's melt in the mouth. which is the best part.

Recommendation: Chelo Kabab, Saag Meat (Seasonal).

Pocket pinch: Very cheap and very pocket friendly.

Bon App√©tit

I went to Peter Cat two weeks back with a friend who was visiting Kolkata for the first time. We had reach at about 1pm to have lunch and had to wait for 15 minutes to get a seat (this raised my friend‚Äôs expectations- seeing the popularity of the place). I declared well before-hand that this is the place to be if you want to have amazing dining experience.  

We got a seat bang next to the entrance which was a let-down to both of us as every time the door opened for a guest, we could hear the unpleasant street madness. The waiting staff was very friendly and helped us with the menu. I ordered their specialty, "Chelo Kebab". I must say, it was one of the most beautiful presentations of mouth watering food that I have ever seen. First bite and it was full of flavor. 

My friend ordered the "Dum-Ki-Raan" and some Naan to along with it. These people really know how to slow a cook a mutton leg. It was tender and full of flavor. For drinks, we ordered beer and the best part was that it was served in antique looking metallic mugs. The manager told me that they are custom ordered to artists from Uttar Pradesh. These people really go the extra yard to give you the best experience. 

The ambiance was really nice and the place was well lit and welcoming. The guests were a mix of families, friends, business mates and couples. Highly recommend this place to everyone!

On my last visit to Peter Cat, we ordered the following:

Farah (delicately seasoned fish kababs)
Shikar (tender boneless pieces of mutton)
Afghani chicken
Keema nun
Sweet lime soda

There were three of us and we wanted to sample things that we had not ordered earlier. During our previous visits to this restaurant, I had mostly been limited to chelo and sizzlers (both of which taste really great). Enough and more has been written about the ambiance, so there is no point in reiterating what most people already know. However, this time around I noticed that even though the servers were courteous and well-mannered, they tend to hurry the customers a lot. It does take time to go through the enormous menu, and it does not help if your waiter is breathing down your neck!¬†

Moving on to the food - it was glorious. Every single bite of the fish kabab was juicy and infused with delicate flavours. Highly recommended. The mutton kabab was spicier than I expected it to be, but this too was a great choice for a starter. It was tender, smoky and tasted good. Even though these were dry in nature, I had no problem eating the kababs with my keema nun. The keema nun was soft, with a thick stuffing of mutton keema, and very filling. I was a bit let down by the Afghani, honestly. Perhaps the kababs had really surprised us with their textures and flavours, and we expected something great out of the Afghani as well. It was well cooked, the chicken was tender, but the gravy was nothing special.

This place is one of my fav spot in Kolkata. When ever I go to Kolkata I try to visit Peter cat for chelo kabab.

I love the Peter cat's chelo kabab very much. The egg poach, rice, few piece of cucumber, tomato, chicken stick and mutton made chelo kabab awesome dish. Peter cat is the place where you can get this awesome chelo kabab.

Along with the chelo kabab we ordered Fish cutlet which is nice but not extra-ordinary.

Anyone coming to Kolkata must visit Peter Cat.

Drink Lovers: You can get wide range of alcholic drinks here.

Yesterday me and my wife and our little daughter had gone for a lunch in Peter Cat. We have ordered Prawn Tanduri as starter. I have never tasted such an awesome food before in my life. The prawn was so soft, it was melting in my mouth. Am giving it 9.5 out of 10. Then We ordered the great chelo kebab which is one of my favorite in Peter Cat. And that was 10 on 10. Then comes sizzler chicken steak. The aroma and taste was so good. The chicken was so soft. I am giving it 9 out of 10. And finally comes the Mutton Dum Ki Ran which is my favorite there. Even my daughter loved it a lot. Please try this item once while visiting Peter Cat. Am giving it 15 out of 10. Thank you and keep enjoying foods of Kolkata.

The warm and dimly lit place will definitely remind you of the history. Like many others, this is one of my favorite place in the city to dine in. For the visitors I would suggest its a must visit place, if you are a food and like to experience new stuffs.

If you visit the place don't forget to miss the chelo kabab, two minced chicken mutton kababs and one chicken kabab server with egg and rice and the sizzlers. I am sure you will love them.

Keep in mind that the will be long queues in lunch and dinner time. If you don't get irritated with the waiting, you will definitely give thumbs up.

The Chello Kebab at Peter Cat never gets old. Well, If you are from Kolkata you know Peter Cat by that one iconic dish. But the other steaks and sizzlers they serve there are by no means less inferior. It is a great place with an ambience that is the signature of Kolkata from the good old days. The service is very good and the drinks are moderately priced. In short, a great place to be out with your family and friends for lunch if not dinner.¬†

You just might have to stand in a queue if you do not have a reservation or you are heading during the rush hours.

This place lacks in ambience and crowd management. The food they offer is also mediocre. People use to stand beside your table waiting for their turn. I don't know whether I have expected too much from a budget restaurant, but if you like to have quiet and calm dining experience with some rich ambience, its advisable to avoid this place, at least during weekends.

The not much talked about Biriyani (s) can give you a yummy effect considering the different taste from the other kolkata biriyanis. Ambience is definitely cool though there the place is always crowdy.  Chello kebabs are famous here. The cocktails are good and praiseworthy no doubt.

I visited this place after hearing a lot from my family and friends. We ordered a chicken Iranian kebab,  fish finger and The Chelo Kabab along with cocktails .  Food was really good as heard but the servicing and hospitality is horrible.  Staff in here doesn't have a single percent of gratitude. They also used cheap local words while directing us to our table. You have to call the waiter and wait for minutes to get yourself a glass of water. Overall excellent food and below standard hospitality.

I went to Peter Cat on the recommendation of many friends. I'm pleased to say that it lived up to my expectations. I ordered a house special sizzler and the popular Chelo kebab both of which were really good! What's amazing is that the restaurant didn't compromise on quality despite the affordable prices. I'm very pleased with my first visit, looking forward to many more! Cheers!

A very famous and popular joint.. Due to this perhaps their service is poor without a smile..had the chellu kabab..felt it wasnt upto the mark same with thei chicken reshmi butter massala..the prawn cocktail was goood but this appetiser was served along with the main course. Sans any regret or apologies by waiter..seems the place runs on its name alone

As you enter after the usual waiting period on the streets, just around the corner of Flury's and the erstwhile Music world of Park street, you are taken to a different era. The legendary Peter Cat is also co-owned by the owner of Mocambo, and there are lots of similarity in the interiors- semi dark with raj-style dressed waiters with strong personalities, soft carpet, low lights and well maintained haughtiness. But they store many large water containers between the main long hall and the small room at the back which mars the experience.
This time I met Ms.Aparna Sen, the famous actor/director and she too ordered as I did, the eponymous Chello kabab, which is the most famous dish of this restaurant. It's a Iranian dish and after taking it in many original Iranian restaurants, I may safely say that Peter Cat makes it much better for the Indian palate. The kababs are much better tasting. It's a dish of rice with butter, two sticks of Kabab, a chicken and a mutton, and some grilled veggies. Very satisfying and filling.
I have taken chicken liver, and prawn cocktail previously- both of which were pretty good, as was the ice cream cola. These guys are good in Indian mughlai and of course in continental dishes.
Service is good and fast.
For a gorgeous family feast, as well as tete a tete with special friends, Peter Cat is the place for every body.

I had been to this place a long tym ago wid my frnds. It was an awesome experience. Everyone knows that they are famous for chello kebabs and sizzlers. We ordered different type of sizzlers. They were really good and the chello kebab was wonderful. The ambience was amazing. It was full with sound of sizzlers everywhere. The dim lights were very suitable. We had a great tym there. But the prices were on a little higher side.

Peter cat embodies the legendary Kolkata cuisine with its many mouth watering and nicely prepared dishes.Chelo Kebabs are a must-eat-item.So are the Sizzlers(the sound heralds the name).Tandoori mixed grill took my breath away, although Chicken steak was average.Amount served is more than enough.Further the restaurant offers a soothening ambience within the glitters of Park street.But prepare for an average 15-30 mins wait at the door on most of the days.

These people are the true legends!! I wonder how they maintain the same taste, texture and quality through ages...!!! The 70's decor.. the old staircases.. the dim light.. and the cat-shaped menu-card.. nostalgia defined!!

Peter cat was the obvious choice for my birthday dinner.. Bhetki Muniere being the obvious choice for starters.. Chelo Kabab and Chicken Steak Sizzler being the ones for main course!

Their serving time is amazingly less! Bhetki Muniere was served by 10mins.. along with the fresh lime soda and fruit cup, the mocktail.. Bhetki Muniere was an absolute bliss.. The cheesy affair with the fresh fish fillets make me fall in love with this place, every time! What I adore more about this dish is the sweet-n-spicy potato pieces served, instead of french fries.. I can swear by this dish, really!!!

The mocktail, Fruit Cup was a little strange to my taste.. Apple and papaya pieces put in a blend of soda and mixed fruit juice.. lacked the punch..

Chicken Chelo Kabab is my another favourite.. The buttered rice plays the perfect companion for the grilled veggies and the kababs.. The reshmi kabab was super-soft.. I always find the seekh kabab a little spicy, the reason for I love this dish!

Then comes the Chicken Steak Sizzler.. The spicy, tangy potato strips and the juicy, succulent chicken steak.. mindblowing!!

Peter Cat always makes us too full to try out any of their dessert items.. No exception this time too!! Will try to try their meringue someday, I hope!

Peter Cat ....if you consider the food and ambience  undoubtedly it is one of the best restaurants  in Kolkata. Their chelo kebab is just mind blowing. The quantity is really good. I couldnot finish one full plate. I have heard that their service is slow. Well today they were super fast. They served our food within 10 mins! And there was a little thing which i liked very much, that was their onions. I dont know what they add to those onions but they taste awesome. The Only one thing they need to change is the behaviour of their young waiters. One of them told my friend to move the plate to another place. Surely that was his duty. Teach them some manners and I shall give you full 5.

Everybody I know and their uncle recommended this place. "Oh you are going to Kolkata for work, you must eat at Peter Cat", they said.

Well, to check out what's the hype is all about, I called to make a reservation and was told - "we don't take reservation" (many places don't take reservations on weekend, so it is cool). I get to the place and am told there is a waiting for 45 mins. 'Must be damn good, if so many people are waiting,' I thought to myself. And so I waited among a large crowd.

Finally got a table and ordered food. The place still has decor from the raj era (I mostly guess, because the dim lighting makes it hard to see).

After some time, the famed chelo kababs came out of the kitchen. And they were worth the wait and exercise. Succulent, right balance of spice, and fulfilling portion size. ¬†Loved it, gobbled it. It was mind blowing.

And that is where the blowing of mind stopped. Rest of the food was very average. May be I was expecting too much because of the long list of recommenders, large crowd in the waiting, and the super entr√©e. But there wasn't anything worth writing and raving. The chicken sizzler was honestly garden variety.

The service was good, as you would expect from a place so highly recommended by everyone. Prices are reasonable.

But in the end... Peter Cat turned out to be a one trick pony.

Old world decor, the furnishing along with the recipe has not changed since inception.

The place is known for its Chelo Kebabs. Add the sizzlers to it. They serve the best sizzlers.

Do not expect any thing more than basic on the service front. Please have sufficient time in hand if you are going to Peter Cat. Expect to be on a waiting list if you land up during lunch hours on week ends.¬†

The taste of food is one to die for. The place is one of the most economical in the city for food and liquor.

I cannot say or comment about one of the oldest restaurants of the town. I say I am not eligible enough . But because I am here to review, this is what I can comment on.

Headed for PC at around 1.30 in the afternoon and happy , no waiting in queues. Smooth entry into the restaurant and wham!
A new world opened up in front of me. Identical like Mocambo.
Same old dim lighting, magical feel and yes the smell of delicious food in the air. Very charming and magical. As they say, Old is Gold.

Seated myself in 5 odd minutes and placed the order without even looking at the menu.
Yes, you got that right.

Chelo Kebab.¬†

The much famed iranian dish. The chicken version for me. And the mutton version for my friend. Cannot comment on his, but mine...well, read on.

In about 5 minutes, I saw this plate stacked with chicken kebabs, grilled tomatoes, capsicums and a cucumber. Buttered rice with an egg poach and two mutton seekh on the side. A lovely affair!

And did i tell you, the rice smelled of cinnamon and the taste, it was light and nice. Wallah!
I actually found the cinnamon on my plate.

The kebabs were pretty good, bite sized and the grilled tomatoes were good. I liked the right side of the place. Now, the mutton seekh which sat on the left.
Now, I've never tried mutton seekh before and honestly? I liked it. It was soft and tasted nice.

I really liked the chelo kebabs. And I'll sure be back for more.
One plate and you're stuffed. It is a big meal for a person and I happened to gobble down everything.

Well, blame my greed for good food!

Will be back for more,
Cheers!

Recently went there with my family. It was a Sunday evening. Reached there at around 8 pm and found a long queue in front of us. So we put our name in the waiting list and had to wait for atleast 1.5 hours before getting a table. We went in and ordered a strawberry mocktail,fish makhmali and chelo kebabs. The mocktail was not at all good and was simply a strawberry milkshake. The fish makhmali was good but the chelo kebabs were horrible. The dish itself was not properly heated,such that even the butter refused to melt. My mom found a piece of eggshell in her egg and the mutton had an overdose of coriander and jeera powder. I had visited Peter cat many times before,but this time I was really disappointed with the food. The restro has fallen in standards,only the name remains.

I guess the most famous restaurant in Park Street. Been there in my college life & never feel to go back again. I guess this already describe my experience. Frankly speaking I really did not like their food especially that famous Chelo Kabab. But there sitting arrangement is comfortable & cosy & service is good & helpful & lot to improve in food especially when you are in Park Street.

There is usually a lot of crowd outside Peter Cat especially during lunch and dinner hours. I would not recommend you to go there if you are expecting to get a table because you simply won't. It is also not a good idea to go with kids as they will get restless. Now for the food and staff. Me and my family are vegetarian and we were surprised by the huge variety they had of vegetarian food. I personally enjoyed the food a lot but most of the restaurant is dimly lit, not a good place for selfies. The staff was good, though due to the great crowd the service time was slow. The desert menu didn't have the greatest of variety but it was ok

Peter Cat !! The name says it all. It is one of the old heritages of Park Street and its popular for its legendary CHELO KABABS and mouth watering Sizzlers.¬†
Now coming to the ambiance. Its somewhat like the retro 60's atmosphere with dim lights, minimum decor and old days staircase. It remains packed up even in the weekdays during the busy office hours ........ u'll get to know by the long queue outside the restaurant almost everyday. So getting a table here without waiting is almost an impossibility,¬†
It was on DASHAMI this year when me and two of my friends visited this place. As normal, we had to wait for around 30 minutes before we got a table. BENGALI crowd dominated the place on that eve.¬†We all were hungry as hell, thus without wasting time we ordered their legendary Chelo Kabas and Prawn cocktail as an appetizer along with diet cokes.
The long wait was worth it on the basis of the quality of the food. They served our food within 10 minutes.
Chelo kabab - Peter cat serves the best chelo kabab in town. No doubt in that. It includes 2 mutton stakes,  6 chicken kebab,                               one grilled tomato, bed of rice and on top of that a poached egg 2-3 butter cubes at the side which adds more flavour. ¬†
Prawn cocktail - It was too too sweet for me and i felt too much of tomato in it for which i didn't liked it much. ¬†
Diet coke - Now what to describe about it :P
The quantity of the chelo kabab was enough for one's meal. The best part is that they maintained their quality of food even during the Puja time. The waiters were descent enough to explain each and every dish (if u ask them).¬†All in all a it was great (except the appetizer). Next time i visit here i am surely gonna try their Sizzlers.

food: nothing that you say(or rater type in this case!) is enough to describe the awesomeness of this place. the starters, the sizzlers and of course the chelo kebab! its the paradise for food lover like me. you have to experience this place, it can not be described.
ambience and service: the heritage involved to this place certainly adds to it ambience by a great amount. but the place is a bit small and everytime you have to wait to get a table. service is decent enough.

price: this is the achilles heel of peter cat at least for me! i am only a college student so its a bit tough to spend 700-800 on a meal in a regular basis. the food served worths every paisa you pay for but still its costly for me.

Great ambiance and really a multi cuisine. Drinks are available but very costly. Dont miss sizzlers and chelow kebab. But I dont like the long queue for food though its worth waiting in case of Peter Cat. Prawn items are very good here because they really clean up the prawn before cooking. In most of the places I have seen not-so-cleaned-up prawns, but here you can understand why you have to wait an hour to get your fingers dirty.

What can i say about one of the most famous restaurants in Kolkata. I simply love this place and can go here any number of times. Chelo kabab (platter of rice, butter, mutton seekh, chicken tikka and egg poach) is the dish to crave for. The combination is simply yum. The sizzlers are also quite delicious. 
Be it with friends or family it has always been a perfect place to go and spend time.

As many would have at Peter Cat, I too went for chelo kebab.. however like I would do, I go a little different and chose the mutton version (mutton chelo). 
Well.. It didn't leave much of an impression on me. 

Taste was ok. Sheekh kabab was a little dry to my liking. Plating was good and even though there was a huge rush and everybody ordering chelo only..every plate looked identical. So good job on that.

I would have expected the server to talk more and engage more with the customer. Service was prompt. 
I was in the end more interested to run away from the place and didn't want anything more which I think isn't good for a restaurant. However, this restaurant is very mature operationally and do good at whatever they do. I hope the management becomes more professional and makes this place into a fine dining place. 

This place has a long history and a lot of potential which not being worked upon. As they operate now, this place will always exist but will never become great.

Out of the busy street of Park st., this place is like a oasis. The old nostalgia type decor and the old days type uniform of the waiters makes you feel the heritage of this place. Some people may complain about the dark lighting of the place, but to my taste the dim lighting makes it even more romantic, and of course the tables are very well lit with lamps hanging from over the head. The sits are also very cozy. 
Now coming to food, the mythical Chello kebab, was overall good I must say, with the rice cooked to perfection, served with a piece of butter, topped with an egg, and sided with some vegetables; but the Kebabs itself, was not that mouth watering. In a plate of Chello kebab there are two types of kebabs, one is mutton and the other is chicken, and they both were good but nothing very special. But I must Confess that the overall platter was too good to look at, and it can also fill up ones stomach completely.
Coming to sizzler this place serves one of the best sizzlers in town. We ordered simple chicken steak, and it was delivered to us in a very beautiful wooden tray. The sizzling sound and again the look of the platter was awesome.¬† They know how to serve and beautify, I must tell. 
Though the bill was a bit of a pinch to the pocket, yet I must Say that think of this restaurant for any special event you wanna enjoy in an eatery. Peter Cat won't let you down any bit.

Love this place. Food is just awesome. Legendary Chello Kabab is a must have but apart from that sizzlers are also very good. I had one roasted chicken sizzler and it was awesome. In sweet dish try scuffle or brownie & vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. Its really really good. 

Only one thing I dont like abt this place is small table for two at the left of the entrance. Those could have been better.

One of the iconic diners of #Kolkata. Peter Cat knows how to make its customers happy. It is best know for its chello kababs, but that is not the only item on the menu to droll over, so my recommendation is, be a little ambitious, try something else on the menu other than chello kababs and sizzler :)

my friends and I dropped into peter cat on dasami evening....The place was crowded...Though within 20 minutes we get a table...
I felt the place is too shadowy....
Now coming to the food...We ordered chelo kebabs...american banana split...and warm brownie with vanilla icecream and hot chocolate sauce..
I loved the chelo kebab,...the rice were perfectly cooked...The kebabs were amazing...
I found the brownie in the icecream was too dry for my liking...But the banana split truly made my day...
Overall I will surely visit again and again.... :-)

One thing I hate about this place is the time you have to wait before you finally get your hand on a table. The rest is absolute bliss. Love the taste here. 

If you are planning for a meal here for the first time, go for their award winning Chello Kebab or House Special Sizzler. Though I personally prefer their cold buffet. Do not forget to order your choice sweet taste post main course. They are too good to miss.

Service wise they are courteous. Though for the last couple of times I am missing the warmth in their conversation a bit. Taking all together, its a good place for family or business gathering.

Though my favorite of all times, I wont' recommend you to go and have Chinese or Indian food there.¬†

The points you have to consider is...its an old restaurant with age old decorations and staffs though the staffs are nice and well behaved and efficient. So, if you want very exquisitely adorned food on your plate, you are not going to get that.

My hot favorite which one should try out...be you are vege or non-vege is Tandoori Broccoli. Aweeeeesome. :)

and, there are others like chelo kakab (which you already know) and mixed grilled sizzlers which has chicken, mutton, beef, prawn, fish, egg and vegs. if you don't eat beef...tell them beforehand (mind it that not all the sizzlers are great).

Try grilled bhetki and dum ki raan...

I don't know what happened to the quality of dishes at peter cat here. The quality of the food has degraded so much, had it today, the quality degradation of the food may be due to the durga puja rush or maybe due to price inflation. We had ordered house special sizzler, chelo kabab & chicken mayonnaise. The chelo kabab was okay but the house special sizzler was filled with potato and carrots, the chicken mayonnaise lacked chicken, it was mostly vegetables in mayonnaise. They left me greatly dissatisfied. I used to love this place, even now I do but still seriously these guys might increase the price but atleast provide quality food.

Not too delighted after we had meals at Peter Cat with friends. .The biriyani we ordered was not up to the mark.. okay it was a different biriyani lets say... but it will not please any biriyani lover. The abundance of fried onions made it taste like something different. The whole essence of Biriyani was unavailable. It could have been much much better. Nevermind, there is always chances of improvement. ¬†We ordered Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta with Biriyani, regarding Chicken Bharta, it was good, i will not say superb but was good among all the things we ordered. The gravy was fine mixture of chicken pieces. But the latter one Chicken Butter Masala, it was below par, there were only two pieces one was a total waste, and the gravy was not up to the mark. The little bit sweet feeling was making the gravy unacceptable. I mean when you find an empty Chicken Bharta in few minutes and no one is touching Chicken Masala it proves for itself :) we also ordered Mutton Sheek Kabab. it tasted really good. Thumbs up. After summing up our lunch the cocktail was cheerful but what we ordered with our drinks is a chilly babycorn and that was the worst thing of the day. It was not crunchy at all rather it was soft and bad to taste. We had brilliant experiences in Peter Cat in the past. so, the amount of expectation was on the higher side but we are really disappointed. But never mind there are always chances of improving and may be it was not our day.Anyway enjoy being a Foodie...:) :) :)

One of the most famous n top rated restautants of Kolkata.¬†

Went there some time back. Had heard a lot about this place n read some nice reviews. So finally went there.

i liked the ambiance very much. the soft lighting makes for an ideal place for a romantic meal.

Had the famous chelo kebab n beer. Frankly it did'nt quite live up to my expectations. It itself being a main course sort of a thing did noy satisfy my hunger for the kebabs. The chicken was nice but the mutton pieces did not taste good.¬†

For dessert we had Warm Brownie with hot chocolate sauce. that was really nice.

Would like to revisit for the well known sizzlers there. Expecting a better experience.

Do I need to write much about Peter Cat? It is a place where I visit often whenever I think of Chelo Kebab and Sizzlers. The ambiance is good and the decor is very pretty. The Chelo Kebab is the best in Kolkata. The last time I visited the place, I had Prawn Mocktail for starter and it was super delicious. Even the sizzlers here are very delicious. A must-visit for people who are new to Kolkata or have still not visited the place.

I finally went there once, one of the oldest restaurants of kolkata right there in the middle of the city at Park street. Heard a lot abt this place. To me it looked like an average place. Ambience looks old and dated - may be it is maintained like this yo give a heritage look but i did not quite appreciate it. Food was good though, tandoor non veg items were fabulous and served quickly. We spent couple of hours there and wd rate it avg.

Peter Cat is without a doubt the BEST restaurant in this city.
I absolutely LOVE the north Indian food here. I have been there quite a few times and each time the visit has absolutely been a delight. The beautiful ambience of the restaurant, which, by the way is always full ¬†is a stunner. The staff is pretty good and courteous.
I personally haven't had a chicken reshmi butter masala as good as Peter Cat anywhere else in the city. It's my personal favourite. And the Chicken Sizzler, as known to everyone is a MUST have. It definitely gets boring without it.
The best thing about Peter Cat though is, ¬†that it doesn't create a dent in your pocket, it's absolutely affordable!! :)

The chello kebab,  which is a speciality item here failed to impress me. The ambience of the place was good, though the seating arrangements were a bit cramped for my taste.  The dish that really rocked here was the fish steak sizzler. Mutton and chicken steaks were great too. But none of the items really did blow my mind. The desert were a bit better.  The chocolate souffl√© was superb and light, the hot brownie was exactly right, the texture was great too. The caramel custard, however,  was too sweet. Overall,  it was an a average experience.

Its a sizzling place in park street. Just beside Au bon pain it looks plain from outside but the flock of people waiting,outside will tell you its sizzling hot inside.
If you happen to be in park street then this place should be on your list.
They serve one of the best sizzlers in town and probably any you might have had. Their taste and preparation are unique.
You may have regular food anywhere but if you are here then make sure to have a chef's special sizzler(non veg) and veg grilled steak.
Chelo kabaabs are just awesome here. The best. These both items are speciality and a must try.
Regular food is nice, but i can't comment as i was too engrossed in their specialty tastes. Nice interiors and a nice place for a couple to have a date. Slightly costly but each penny spent here is worth.

Don't miss this place

Peter Cat is one of the city's oldest establishments, with an atmosphere that harkens back to its early days in the 1960s. The dining room is intimate, with white stucco walls, Tiffany-style lamps, and soft lighting; the menu is a mixture of good Continental and Indian dishes, especially the tandoori fare.

I have actually lost count of the number of times i ordered a plate of their legendary CHELLO KEBAB and their HOUSE SPECIAL SIZZLER with liver,chicken sausages, sauteed vegetables.these popular dishes are now way beyond recommending ;)

Recently in a couple of experiences, i sampled some other dishes,of which DUM-KI-RAAN is a stand out dish. tender spiced mutton, the full plate of it has lots n lots to share for 6-7 persons.pair it up with the soft cheese nans..bliss!

CHICKEN MARAKESH is a similar dish as chelo,is as good if not better.i loved it as an alternative main course.

PRAWN COCKTAIL- this was disgusting! the cream sauce was tad too sweet, with a overpowering sour taste of tomato ketchup in it, we had to leave it after having a spoon each. Mocambo does this best!

FRESH LIME SODA lacked the punch,
for desserts the usual fare of CHOCOLATE BROWNIE WITH VANILLA ICECREAM & CHOCOLATE SAUCE, TRUTI FRUTI etc are nice.
The staff to be frank,are ill mannered.they indirectly ask for empting the tables even when the hours of rush are over.

p.s. the last time we occupied the corner table of 1st floor, n the fire alarm actually rang on serving the sizzler on table! funny indeed!! :p

Peter Cat is one of the most popular restaurant in Kolkata. If you visit Kolkata and have not tried their Chelo Kabab then your visit to this city is not worth it.

PETER CAT.
My father shared me a story of my childhood related to this place.
I asked him to show me the cat because I thought this is a place for cats.

My parents celebrated my fifth birthday at this place which I don't remember at all. But I have a connection which takes me there every time I am confused of anything.

My favorite dish is not their Chelo Kabab but Bekti Munier. It is served with potatoes which is delicious in the mouth.
House Special sizzler, Grilled Fish, Grilled Chicken, Chicken Steak, Mutton Hamburger Steak, Dam-ki-run, I love them all.
Avoid trying prawn cocktail which I felt overhyped as per its presentation and name.
Finish with Souffle or Warm Brownie which fulfills the urge of good food.

The ambience is old class which is shouting for a complete renovation.
The food tastes excellent if you choose them with care.
The staffs are good not great.
The location is at the heart of Park Street which is easy to locate for any noobs.

Although the restaurant is specifically famous for it's sizzlers and chello kebabs, I would recommend people not to leave the restaurant without having a taste of Chicken Tandoori. It's one of the best chicken tandoori you are ever gonna experience. Food quality as a whole is great, provided you get a hassle free entry at the restaurant due to excessive rush.

One of the Kolkata eating institutions - you've not been to Kolkata, if you have not had food at Peter Cat ;)

First things first.. Is Chelo Kebab the best thing you will eat ever? Definitely no.. In fact I find it significantly over-rated. Try for yourself. It is anyway worth a try.¬†

I personally prefer other things on the menu, like Shah Nauz and Harem's Joy (hope the spellings are right!). Tandoori Mix grill is also a good bet for a group eating out.¬†I prefer to drink the Dansberg beer here (from a brewery in Sikkim). It is good (not great), but is rarely available anywhere else.

This is one of the old world restaurants from good old days of my childhood. If you are in Kolkata, Peter Cat is a must visit. If you plan to go there in weekends or public holidays, have patience to wait outside for a minimum half an hour but its worth! The restaurant is located on one of the most lively places of the city ie. Park Street.It is just beside Flury's,Music World. It is a very old resturant......food quality and service are quite good..the price is reasonable....the chelo kebabs are very popular here..but i prefer the sizzlers.

as soon as u enter the place,u feel you have been transported back to the 80s!!the veg food needs a serious improvement...
exception - the veg sizzlers and veg chelo kabab (the only things tat keep bringing me back)..They are a treat to ur taste buds..

veg chelo kabab is a must order!! and also their mixed grill sizzler!!
the service is not something to write home about..
 rather its a pain in ur ass!!
¬†a mark deducted just because of the service!!
getting a table here without wait is almost impossible..so be prepared to wait!!
but I had recommend it coz this place gives one the feel of the old Park Street!!

Ahhh the very famous and legendary Peter Cat. The nane is enough I guess. I remember I went to this restaurant with my parents when I was may be 10 or 12. Since then, my tastebuds have always recognized Peter Cat as one of the best restaurant in Park Street area. 
So we thought we should pay a visit with my girlfriend and school besties again this Puja. Coming to Peter Cat and Ordering for Chelo Kabab was so obvious a choice. And as usual, it tasted like heaven...slurp.
I remember a blunder we did and for this we will only blame one of the waiter who took our order and did not guide us for our order even after asking. May be because it was Ashtami and they were too busy with the customers in the crowded restaurant. Now let's share the blunder with all: We had made a mistake of ordering Tandoori Broccoli and we thought we will be served Tandoori Chicken assorted with Broccoli leaves. :P Right after the dish was served, we were like... what the heck is this!! Lol. Two grilled broccoli leaves on a dish! It was so thankful of the other waiter who helped us out in changing the dish. 
The rest we had ordered were fantastic. Still I'd suggest all not to pay a visit to this place during the Puja time. Peter Cat is much better in the other seasons. 0.5 deducted for the silent waiter who doesn't care to open his mouth ever. :P

Located just below Stephen court at Park Street this is the most loved restaurant of Kolkata! This restaurant needs no introduction,so I will directly share one of my experience giving priorities on food quality and quantity , service and ambiance.¬†
So, it was my brother's treat and we decided to go out for a family dinner , and what can be better than Peter Cat for this kind of events!¬†
We ordered, Whisky sour(for me) , Asperagus soup, ¬†2 chello kebab's (original) , 1 sizzling dum ki raan and 1 grilled bhetki with dinner breads.¬†

Food quality and quantity----->
Whisky Sour--- Made of syrup,lemon juice and whisky ¬†served in tumbler, well garnished with a cherry in bottom, I just ¬†loved it.
¬†Asparagus soup---- This was a pretty normal asparagus soup and there was nothing special in it.
Chello kebab-- Certainly Peter cat ¬†makes ¬†the best Chello in town, which includes 2 mutton stakes , ¬†6 chicken kebab,one grilled tomato, poched egg, rice with adequate butter cubes. This one is what Peter Cat is famous for and it is just wonderful!! A whole meal for one.¬†

Dum ki rann(sizzzler)-- This is a wonderful preparation of mutton and we all just loved it.

Grilled bhetki -- This includes 2 bhetki fillets, 5 roasted potatoes and other vegetables ( beans,carrots). The bhetki filled were served with a sauce which ruined its taste!! Well, we din't liked it.Ambiance------->¬†A dimly lit place, with comfortable chairs and sofas with lamp shed on each table, I just love Peter Cat's ambiance! Service---------> ¬†Coming to service, most of the staffs are well groomed while some needs serious English training! Again the service is fast, which we all like at Peter Cat.

Went to Peter Cat with family, and was instantly impressed by the ambiance. Minimum lighting and the circular tables with the central lamps give a very retro kinda feel to the place. Coming to the food, their sizzlers were great (a must-try is the mixed tandoori platter) and the chicken tikka masala was nice as well. But the place really needs to increase the number of vegetarian options in its menu. Also I found that the continental section could be expanded a bit. Service was prompt but the waiters seemed a bit haughty. Overall a decent experience

When we were in school, we always had our birthday parties in Peter cat. It is one of the finest dining places in park street and no matter what you order.. You would invariably love the taste. The quality is outstanding.they should probably change the decor to attract more customers.. But it is just awesome. All dishes tried had no complains at all.

Horrifying staff behavior. The managing at the gate was extremely poor. It caused dissatisfaction and chaos. Over and above that, the executive staff were rude and not at all cordial. For an old top notch restaurant, a lot more was expected. 
Starters were great. Apart from that, the food quality and interiors surely need a relook.

If you are visiting first time, try "Chelo Kabab - The Original". It is awesone.
Few tips:
¬§ Best time to go for lunch is between 3:30-4:30 pm on weekends, else you will have to wait for hours

¬§ Never sit on the table near the entrance, hot air will rush in from outside every time the door opens! It's irritating

¬§ Beverages (non-alcoholic) and desserts are not that good

Overall the food is awesome and worth the wait in long queue.

Mesmerized! Complete beauty peter! Whenever you need to taste traditional continental just hop in. One of the city's pride and all season busy restaurant in kolkata. If you are well aware in park street culture must have visited here over and over.

The most beauty of this old restaurant is not only the food but I must say perfect food all the time..same taste mouth watering beauty and also the service which is excellent. As rush always goes specially in the weekend so they provide pretty fast service and quick to respond all of your queries.

Chelo: I bet the best chelo in the town can't beat this any other. Authentic 11/10

Beckty Muniere: the fish which melts in your mouth, you will dream about it's taste. Amazed 10/10

Sizzlers: Killer. The sauce, the grilling, everything is so perfect,¬† you would fall in love with this. I did ;-)

You don't have to love continental or have to be foodie, once you visit here you would be!! To start the journey, Peter is waiting with his cat to guide you to hunt.

Peter cat. Will fall short of words on describing this place.
Park Street, the incredibly posh and fun-filled stretch of road in Calcutta, overflowing with restaurants, and surprisingly, most of them being top-class. That's where Peter Cat belongs, and nowhere else, and it lives up to its reputation!
Ambience: The atmosphere inside peter cat is dark, shadowy, and has an air of sophistication, mostly due to the age of the establishment as well as the crowd class. Remains crowded almost all the time. But the wait is fruitful when you take a seat and sizzlers come to your table.¬†

Food: The sizzlers and the Chelo Kababs! They alone are enough to satisfy everyone‚Äôs taste! It‚Äôs a guarantee that one will experience at least three sizzlers going to other tables during an entire meal at Peter Cat. The meat sizzlers contain sufficient amount of potato fries and salad to not make it totally meaty. The Chelo Kababs contain chicken and mutton kababs, rice, butter and salad. A perfect choice for someone who can‚Äôt decide which dish to take!

Something else worth mentioning is the drinks of Peter Cat. They must have an excellent bartender because their cocktails are amazing! Be it a Screwdriver, or a Gimlet, or a John Collins, it‚Äôs made perfectly, though people who drink regularly will probably find them too diluted.

Although this restaurant is famous for sizzlers and chelo kebabs, the cold chicken sizzler, fish fingers and fish kebabs r worth trying. My favourite family restaurant till date. Whenever my family arranges for any dinner-The 1st name that comes to mind is PETER CAT!
And not to forget, the staffs r cordial, they will make you feel comfortable when you reach a table.
A 4.5 from my side.

There has been endless reviews but in spite of them I can't stop myself from reviewing this place. It's truly legendary. Chelo kebab and sizzlers are its speciality. I find the appearance of their wine menu quite fascinating, especially the cocktail menu. The ambience is heavenly thus there's always a waiting queue in the evenings. Nonetheless, the food is worth the wait. Chicken steak and the fish steak sizzlers are my favorite apart from the chelo kebab.

Food and location of this outlet overseeded all the other possible flaws that it incurs. Staff behaviour is not cordeal but won't give you a hard time either. Peter Cat can be thought of as a typical park street restaurant with excellent food and decent ambience with low light. 

I went there with few of my friends for celebrating a friend's birthday. First, they didn't take our booking over phone mentioning that its on first come first serve basis. We took a cake along with us. However, restaurant staffs strictly told us not to open the cake or do anything remotely close to a cake cutting ceremony. I won't be going back there for celebrating any occassion since without booking one has to stand there for at least 40 minutes on any weekend and in the end one will not be able to celebrate. 

We ordered chicken irani kabab and fish makhmali as starters. They wrongly served chicken reshmi kabab at our table along with the ones ordered which they apologise but added it to the bill. This, to my belief, is not at all a good etiquette. Fish makhmali was very soft, prepared with the right amount of spices. From the group of 7, there went orders for 5 chelo kababs (as expected), a house special sizzler and a cold chicken salad for main course.

While I need not speak about Chelo Kabab, the sizzler that I ordered was cooked to perfection. Chicken steak with mutton sausages provides an awesome combination and mouth watering taste. Definitely go for this dish if you are not craving for having the most talked about chelo kabab. Chicken salad from cold buffet menu wasn't bad either apart from the fact that there were lots and lots of mayo. Quantity was hefty, more than enough for a single person to finish it. 

Overall, it is always nice to be back at Peter Cat beacuse of the quality of food that it serves. And that is the sole reason why one will find 100 people queuing outside for more than an hour. The reason of not rating the outlet higher is due to the attitude of house staff which is far from friendly.

Peter cat, located right at the heart of Park Street,Kolkata needs absolutely no introduction. Its the most widely spoken about Resturant in the city. You would always come across that one person in kolkata who would not only suggest, but insist that you visit the legendary resturant, Peter Cat. First and foremost, it is EXTREMELY difficult to acquire a place here so you must probably go for prior reservations. While the Chelo kebab still reigns to be the signature dish, a personal favourite would be the Prawn cocktail. Its a cold and tangy dish and is highly recommended from my side. The sizzlers are great and simply delicious. The interiors are dim yet classy and the staff very efficient and courteous. Their service is quick and you don't have to wait long after your order is placed. This is one of the many resturants that truly defines kolkata and if you're here, a trip to Peter Cat is mandate :) Cheers!

Sunday Afternoon... food street of Kolkata... waiting for Chelo kababs! You must be in front of Peter Cat! No prices for guessing. The signature dish of Peter Cat is Chelo Kabab, you can call it to be a heritage dish of this place! Not sure how many times I had it, but still the magic works. The ambiance of the restro is good as well, always filled with people. If you are at Park street missing Chelo kabab at Peter Cat is a sin.

Another of those coasting along on nostalgia places which isn't such a bad thing. Food memories are powerful and if Peter Cat is where you spent your glorious childhood and youth, nothing else would ever suffice. Too bad I was  a Persian food veteran by the time I entered Peter Cat and too bad I got steered towards the one Persian dish they attempt to make there. 



Chelo kebab - which in the Peter Cat version has a koobideh and shish kebab combination - is perhaps the most iconic Persian dish. Inexplicably, Peter Cat adds a fried egg on top of the rice which is definitely not traditional - there's never any fried egg in chelo kebab - only the kebab, rice (chelo), grilled tomatoes (and pepper), loads of melted butter on top of rice and sumac powder to sprinkle on top. Sometimes if you request, you can get a raw egg yolk to mix with your rice - but I'm yet to see an actual Persian person mix in the yolk - hello salmonella! 



So anyway - all this digression just to say that Peter Cat's chelo kebab is nothing like Persian chelo kebab. And if you've never had the real thing you actually might like this - it's not bad, not amazing, but not mediocre either. I've had more chelo kebab meals than I can count and have even made chelo kebab myself several times so this just doesn't cut it. Also, didn't grow up in Cal so the nostalgia factor  just isn't there.

Ok...This one's the pride of Calcutta and the jewel in the throne of the king of Calcutta foodies- Park Street. One thing to die for is the Chelo kabab. Its a complete meal in itself. I could not have anythig else after that. So I dont know a lot about the desserts. Another thing, the quantity is huge, so order one plate first and another one only when you deem necessary. Saves a lot of food that way. The world needs it! The menu is cool with the card shaped as the logo - Peter the cat. The interiors are a reminder of the old Calcutta dining culture. No music, faint jingling of the stainless steel crockery. The seating with heavy chairs and sofas and the dim lighting. The only advice would be to reach before 7 pm on weekdays to avoid being starved to death and never attempt to have food there on weekends! You would be standing (or if you're lucky sitiing on a stool) waiting like a beggar on the streets of Calcutta and by the time you get your plate, the hunger will faze out. -.5 for that :)

The chicken steak sizzler was good, but kebabs are over rated. We get such kebabs even in Oly pub, no offence. The place is always over crowded and I believe they should try limiting the seats as at times you don't even get a place to walk. Sizzler is a good eat there, but again over rated.

The name says everything for this legendary restruant. I have got special memories with PC. It made a special day very very special, my b'day.
Anyone wants to get a real taste of some great food, this is the place you should drop into without a second thought in your mind. PC's vintage Chelo Kabab (non veg), I bet no one makes it better than them in this universe. With the rice n butter and those kababs and grilled vegetables and last but not the least with the herbs and spices it create a perfect aroma and taste. You gotta try it to feel its content & ingredients.
Same goes for the thier sizzlers and the cocktails.
With dim lights and a quiet and nostalgic decoration PC creates a perfect ambiance for all food lovers.
I know this is not enough but that is all I can describe PETER CAT..!!

I recently moved to Kolkata and being a foodie, I did my homework about good food here. Almost everyone who is from Kolkata said that if I do not eat at Peter Cat, then i would miss the best food Kolkata serves. This raised my expectations very high. I Was really excited to eat at Peter Cat but I was highly disappointed.
The very famous Prawn Cocktail tasted more like tomato sauce and mayonnaise. The prawns in the cocktail were just okay. Not juicy at all.
Then I ordered a cocktail which was served to me with a fly in it. It was replaced but it has killed my mood for good food by then. The Chelo kabab quality was very good but didn't taste great. 
I got Very disappointed with the food, we tried to order something regular. We ordered the sizzler and were told that the sizzler in Peter Cat is just a piece of meat, no mashed potato/rice/noodles but we could order a bread roll separately. Frustrated by then we ordered the Bread roll which was just bread. We couldn't finish the steak as the meat wasn't cooked properly and had to order a egg mayonnaise salad just to fill up our stomach. Surprisingly, the salad was quite filling but not satisfying for the taste buds. The fish steak was decent, nothing spectacular.
I was disappointed with the service as well. The servers kept bumping into customers, spilling food everywhere. 
I would never go back to Peter Cat again after this horrible experience.

So after hearing much about the legendary place, yes, its shameful that a Calcuttan like myself has visited for the first time yesterday. Needless to say the visit was much to ones liking. The welcome however was not great but I dont blame them considering that people were still showing up at 2.30 PM for a waiting of 30-40 minutes. So maybe my opinions on the overall experience took a hit since I had waited for 40 min for what was simply a 'hit the spot' sunday lunch.
Having visited with my wife, we called for an Iranian Kebab, the chicken steak sizzler and the Tandoori Sizzler. Not wishing to be harshly critical, but the Iranian Kebab tasted barely Iranian but then I was comparing it to my experience with the real deal I had been eating for a week last year in Tehran. This brought me to take my gaze to the neighboring table to see the legendary Chelow Kebab. Again, drawing comparison to my experience last year and seeing the missing mix of saffron rice and the overdose of masala and veggies in the chicken kebab, I decided this dish may be for some other time.
This was followed by the sizzlers which were very satisfying. the chicken steak sizzler was presented with a healthy topping of brown sauce but some of the stock and red wine flavour was missing. The steak however was beautifully cooked. The portion overall was however a little small. The serving only had one moderate sized steak and the serving of potatoes and veggies could have been better. It was however perfectly cooked and piping hot and tasted great if you choose not to nitpick the fine details.
The Tandoori Sizzler was rather good. The serving size was excellent and coupled with a naan I had a great feast with the misses digging in for a few bites. The mutton sheekh was excellent, the chicken was beautifully cooked and tasted great. However my experience was let down due to a few points though. First, the prawn wasnt properly shelled, the lamb must have been an off cut or something as it was very difficult to find any meat on it, there was only half a boiled egg (expected atleast one) and something that may not appeal to many others is the chicken liver. My wife accidentally popped a bite and immediately spat it out although I dont really mind it. Also the piece of the fish kebab was really small.
The service was as you would expect from any park street eatery but my overall experience was really let down due to the ambiance and the desserts. The place in todays age seems positively shady. The decors nice and could do well with simply better lighting. The desserts on the other hand were horrendous. To be fair I was recommended to have the tutti frutti but I went for an off the menu caramel souffle which was pathetic. Even the fruit beverages were rather poor.
If I was to rate the food alone it would be a solid 4 but the overall experience had mixed feeling throughout so without any breakups I think this is a fair remark but the place is definitely worth more visits.

Ambience is nice but place is quite small so always overwhelming with smell of different dishes and alcohol!!!
We went there on weekdays but still had to wait for about half an hour for a table!!
But the wait was fruitful as the food there is simply awesome!!
We tried some Irani kebab which simply melted in the mouth!! And of course their legendary Chelo kabab !!! Trust me I can even wait for 45 mins to enjoy the dish!! Anyways the chicken kebab in Chelo is better than the mutton kebab!!
One can safely try this restaurant as the food here is always yum!!!

Peter Cat is not just a restaurant, it is an emotion for me! Every time I go to Calcutta, the first pointer on my to-do list is to visit Peter Cat and eat their sizzler and taste their chello kebab. This review is based on one such recent visit.

Ambiance:
Peter Cat cannot be empty post 8. If you don't like queues, reach there at around 7-ish. Dim lamps hanging over each table, faint sounds of cutlery and people talking everywhere. It's like an evening party in that place every time I go. You get your seat and stare into the cat's face that's printed on the sheets that are kept on the table. Yes, I do that.

Food:
I skip through everything in the menu to jump to the part where there are sizzlers and Chelo Kebab. One House Special Sizzler and a Chelo Kebab 'The Original'. The sizzler sizzles its way through to your table. Huge chicken steak topped with potato fries, veggies, sausages and egg, with a base of cabbage leaf. A tiny portion of salad on the other side with pepper. All of this is dipped into a delicious sauce! This is a must, must, must-have. Up next is my lesser favourite dish, Chelo Kebab. The Kebabs are to die for. The rice butter with the egg is a treat for us bongs. However, last time the mutton kebab was a little chewy but everything else made up for it.¬†

Service:
The waiters are quick and nice. They can tell you about the dishes and they sure have good recommendation skills. Super-reasonable food, after all it's Calcutta!

There was a time when dining out meant Peter Cat for me. One of the most famous dinning places in Calcutta and it does live up to its reputation. I am more of a fan of its ambiance than its food actually. My usual order is a House Special Sizzler and I just love the texture and sauce. Fish fry/fingers are good but a little bland. Do not ever try Tandoori Mixed Grill, it disappointed me so badly that I had stopped visiting this place for a long time. And they really need to make the Chello Kebabs a little more softer.Pocket Pinch would be Rs 1500 for meal for two w/o liquor.Weekend visits would mean waiting in the queue for near about half an hour.

All said and done, this place is a Legend and will always be one. So its a MUST VISIT.

Cozy dimly atmosphere, soothing music, amazing service, and most importantly their lip smacking Steak Sizzler, Chelo Kebab, Prawn cocktail are my favourites. Tried many other items and they were good too but mentioned 3 are just outstanding. And i guarantee You wont get this amazing Prawn Cocktail and Chelo Kebab anywhere else. Big big thumbs up. This is one of the reasons once in a yr at least i visit  kol. ;)

The interiors of this restaurant definitely speak of how old it is, with quaint red lamps hanging over vintage wooden tables. However, I definitely do not feel comfortable when restaurants are so dark and mysterious. For one, you don't get to see the varied colours of the food that you have in front of you. Anyway, most of the people in the large group that I went in, decided to order either of Chelo Kebab, their famous Iranian dish, or Chicken Tandoori sizzler. The Chelo Kebab is a very comforting food, with blobs of butter melting into soft rice, while you may at times bite into the little kebabs on one side of the plate, or cut into the fried egg, which was somewhere between an omelette and a sunny-side-up, on the other. This dish surely fills you with a deep sense of satisfaction, though it does not really stand out in terms of taste. The chicken sizzler which I tasted, had too much of an Indian taste in the curry to go with the boiled vegetables that were served. The desserts were a disappointment, as they managed to go wrong with even Chocolate Viennetta. Never before had I tasted chocolate ice-cream which was so hard to cut into, even after I had waited for long, or so tasteless. Surely I had expected a far better experience, considering the hype that surrounds this restaurant.

Chelo Kebab & the Sizzlers are my main source of attraction.¬†
Besides the starters are also delicious.
There are so many reasons to love Peter Cat .....
The only thing I dislike is a long queue if u r travelling a large group.Groups having more than 6 people,will have to wait for atleast an hour if u r going on a holiday/occassions.

So I dare to review one of Kolkata's legend, finally on my (I lost count)th visit to the place. Dropped by on a Saturday evening with a bunch of friends just before rush hour. We started of with a few cocktails(Planters Punch, Peter Cat Cooler and Amazonia), fish makhmali kebab(moist and melt in your mouth pieces of fish, 5 pieces seemed too less), becky muniere(beckty fillets grilled and served in cheesy white sauce with veggies, the edges of the fillets a bit chewy but the middle as tender could be, the sauce is just perfect) and grilled chicken sizzler(a classic sizzler of 2 chicken pieces with veggies, feel like going on and on). Once we were done with the amazing starters(or so we treated them as) we just could not wait for the main course, so it was chicken chelo kebab(the usual), chicken marakesh(tried this dish for the first time, almost like the chelo except the reshmi is a bit different tasting-good different, and instead of the poached egg they serve a minced meat filled chicken over the buttered rice) and a mixed grill sizzler(again a classic of chicken, mutton, prawn, liver etc in a tasty gravy sizzler served with veggies, though the one piece per item leaves you wanting for more). So we gobble everything up as if hungry for days, but we are just not willing to leave(though the steward tried his best to make us leave, bringing the bill to the table at one point). So we went on to order the baked chicken(diced chicken in cheese with onions, capsicum and tomatoes baked to a juciy, awesome, heavenly perfection) and small pegs of smirnoff and just kept on relieving the experience.

But finally it was time to leave, though we wanted to keep on tasting those amazing dishes but our stomachs would not permit. 

Just an amazing place which never disappoints, deducting the .5 because of the pushy arrogant nature of the waiters and stewards(though it was peak hours it is granted but we expect a bit better).

They say the place is too good. well it kind of is.I have an issue understanding waiters in Kolkata. I mean every good old restaurant have a legacy of keeping a bit stubborn waiters. Here it was not particularly the issue but they weren't too pleasing as well.¬†

I went alone, so ordered a Veg steak sizzler and their famous Chelo Kebabs.¬†The steak was good. really nicely cooked and well served. The chewy texture was amazing as it is not usually expected from a veg dish.Chelo kebabs were as per my expectations, a bit hyped. The platter had paneer tikka which was better than Chelo. maybe because it was veg, but still the platter was worth everything.

overall score sheetAmbi: 5/5Food: 5/5 paneer tikka saved it.Service: 4/5 that can definitely be improvedVFM: 5/5 Its bit expensive. Its not a place you will go again and again, but definitely worth a shot.Overall 4.5/5

Peter Cat is a restaurant that probably needs no introduction of reviews. The sheer number of patrons who vouch for Peter Cat is enough to say that this is one of those restaurants that have achieved cult status. 
I remember going to Peter Car since when I was 5 years old. This hissing and crackling sound of sizzlers would leave me awe-struck. At that point of time, the whole thing of so much sound and fumes coming out of a food was all that I can fondly remenber. Now, I'm matured enough to appreciate taste. The chicken steak sizzler is still my favorite. My only complaint is that over the years, the size of the steak has reduced quite a bit. The chello kebab is another house favorite. 
I remember taking a friend of mine from Holland to Peter Cat a few months back. He w went crazy about the Fish Makhmali kebab and the chicken reshmi butter masala. 
My parents simply adore the prawn cocktail and the fish munniere. Infact, my father has been a regular to Peter Cat since the part for decades. I guess very few restaurants has such a tradition to keep up to and I feel happy that Peter Cat still manages to impress me as it did when I first visited the place some 23 of years back.

We had the Legendary Chelo Kebab, Tandoor Mixed Grill Sizzler, Pineapple Blossom & fresh Lime Soda. Chelo Kebab was full of Buttery Aroma. Chicken Kebabs were so soft and juicy. But my favorite was Tandoor Mixed Grill Sizzler, this platter consists of Chicken Grilled Kebabs, Mutton Seekh Kebab, Egg slices, Grilled Prawn. This sizzler tastes awesome and this is specially for those people who love Tandoor dishes. Pineapple Blossom was refreshing and smooth. Ambience is nothing such to hype about, rather its Gloomy with dim lamp shades.

The ambience is amazing. Decor, seating and the dim lights set the perfect mood. Food wasn't that great, maybe I ordered the wrong stuff,or expected too much. Service was quick, but the place is always crowded, so do come in advance ,as you'll have to wait for some time. Waiters and other staff are pretty friendly and warm.

On my second visit, I ordered Chelo kaba chicken, and prawn starter. The prawns were very good, succulent, nicely done. The buttery rice and the kababs make an awesome combo, do try that once.

Peter Cat perhaps would be the one iconic restaurant in the heart of Park Street that can very well represent the dotty foodie nature of Kolkatans. For starters, one has to wait for at least 20 -30 minutes to get a table. Sadly, they don‚Äôt take reservations over the phone, so it does not get any easier. However, it is always worth the wait as the food and ambience is amazing. The dim-lilted interiors along with the lip smacking food make up for the waiting time. The must try on the list is of course, the chelo kebab, the mixed sizzler, chicken Marrakesh and the grilled fish. A pint of beer (served in their legendary heavy weighted silver plated beer mug) or the cocktails complements the food well. 

I had been living outside Kolkata for quite a few years and every time I came back to Kolkata for a vacation, Peter Cat was right there on my ‚Äòplaces to visit‚Äô list. A late lunch (to avoid the usual lunch time queues) with the closest of my friends along with some beer always lifted my spirits!

Two weeks earlier I had visited this place. The ambiance dimly lit place and to me this place is much of hype the major reason being three, one accessibility, right in the middle of park street and second a bit cheaper drinks menu and finally the chelo kebab.¬†

If you are visiting this place on the weekend and looking for a family lunch/dinner, its not the right place. Too crowded. Even while seating on the oppesite side I don't why why that lamp is placed in a position which will block the face of the other person you are talking to.¬†

We had cream of sweet corn for the kid which was good. Sheekh kabab and chicken reshmi on the starters which were sort of OK. On the main course Chelo kebab, which is as usual great and Grilled chicken sizzler which I believe was not up to mark.¬†

In terms of the service its a lousy service.

A must visit if you are in Kolkata. Located at one of the costliest areas of the city, this restaurant has a lot to offer you in terms of food as well as ambience. Ask any resident and they will definitely suggest you to try the famous "Chello Kabab". I having been there suggest the same. It is lip smacking and hard to resist.

The place needs no introduction. Its been there in the limelight zone of Park Street since decades. However the place is a paradise for non vegetarians. My experience as a vegetarian has never been satisfactory.However my friends have beem to the place many times and are fond of its few dishes includig its very famous Chelow Kabab. So you can give this place a try, ambiance and staff courtesy are good. However the dinner might be time consuming as even regular days require half an hour of waiting!

We had to wait one hour outside the restaurant as well as its was marginally tough to get a parking for a sedan.
We were given a 8 seat table to accommodate 9 people. Food was good but not worth one our waiting. There are many restaurants where we get this quality. Cost is quite low so PtCt gets points in this. Ambience was crowded but crowd was good. AC was good. Avoid corner tables, the AC duct doesn't serve corners. The service team is over burdened which is natural.¬†
Overall Peter Cat is a craze.

One of Kolkata's most ravishing restaurants that has always been there as long as I can remember. The food is of exceptional quality. The moment you think of Peter cat its either that delicious Chello Kebab you are probably betting your taste buds on or else its surely the sizzler's sizzling sound that is occupying your mind and heart. I always go here and it is one of the best restaurant Kolkata has to offer. :)

PETER CAT, the crazy foodie spirit of the city is captured and kept safe in the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. The two items on the menu that one must try are the sizzlers and the chelo kebabs. A pint of beer does an amazing task to complement the two. The place is always crowded be it day or night, weekday or weekend so if you are new to the city and this is there in your bucket list do plan in advance and be ready to wait in the queue for some time.

Last year during puja's our cousins decided to have lunch in this famous restaurant in park street....!!
As it was a rush hour and also it was a festival season we had to wait for a long time... Actually we waited for really long time... We became very tired...:/ At about 4.0p.m or something we finally were alloted our seats.... 
The decor was nice ....dimly lit and beautiful interiors.... Without wasting any more time we ordered the famous mutton and chicken chelo kababs and chicken tandooris.... I will say mutton chelo kababs is better than chicken... mutton chelo kebabs¬† were juicy and moist and tenderizing... I really liked it whereas chicken chelo kebabs i found little dry...
Chiken tandoori was also tasty... 
At last we ordered Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and it was yumm....!!:) :) I really liked it...
I definetly want to come again and try the sizzlers as i have heard that they are good...:)

It is class apart and maintains its own league. My friend first took me here,and after that i always keep going back. The food is simply mouthwatering .The smell of the sizzlers in the next table will make you crave for your own dish even more ;)

One of those extremely popular places at Park Street where you have to wait an hour to grab a seat. Sad thing is, they don't allow reservations. The decor is good of course. The food is consistently good i must say. My favorite is the House Special Sizzler. Though many prefer the Chelo Kabab. To be truthful i haven't tried out many of their dishes and prefer to stick to the few that i have liked for a long time.¬†A good place for a treat with your friends or relatives that won't burn a hole in your pocket.

The food quality is not the same as it was 15 yrs ago. The food is very expensive too. There is no arrangement for the customers to wait if the restaurant is fully packed. The customers have to wait on the road. The interior is very suffocated if the restaurant becomes crowded. Their staff is equally rude and uncouth like at Mocambo's. Obviously their administration is also the same.

Yeah. It's Peter Cat. A lot has been said already. Numerous visits have been made. I have always made it a point to visit at odd times so that I dint have to wait!! 4pm for lunch or 7pm for dinner!! Cross that line and you may as well be prepared to wait for an hour!! I am not someone who is prepared to wait that long for food!! 
I love the ambience. Old school and comfy. The semi dark kind of offers you a rare privacy. The staff can be temparamental. Sometimes they are very accomodating but othertimes they can ignore you coldly.
My two staples are Mutton Chelo Kebab and Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler. The second one might raise some puritanical eyebrows but who cares!! Its spicy and huge!!
The kebabs are downright delicious. Every single one of them. My favourite is the Mutton shikari. The Chicken Marakesh is another favorite. 
You can be choosy, picky,fastidious. But one thing is sure if you are a kolkatan you can not ignore Peter Cat.

Food - Good, specially the Chello Kebab, its the full course meal although. If you are a big fond of cream soups, then otherwise avoid.¬†
Drinks - I have not tasted except fresh lime soda which is okay.
Service - It was again not to be mentioned type as i found almost all saturday and sundays are heavily rushed, if not reserved from earlier, one might wait on the road for nearly 1 hour to get a seat in and as soon as you seat, the waiter wants an order ready and once the food is served, they want you to vacant the seat.¬†

Note : The waiter will be waiting for the tips till the very end of your stay over there and unless you pay the tips, he wont go away, I experienced this.

My eternal favourite are the Chello kebabs and Chicken Marakesh.. I dont like the sizzlers here much.. Mocambo serves better ones but i would like to mention The tandoori mixed grill sizzler .. I just love the sauce.. Amazing taste.. The kebabs are really good spclly the Mutton Shikaar kebab and Chicken irani kebab..goes very well with the Cocktails.. To end the meal, have their Tutty fruity icecream.. an eternal fav :)

Every restaurant has its highs and lows. Peter Cat is symbolic of the Old Calcutta charm but in recent times, it has failed to live up to its name. A connoiseur of good food would be able to spot the change in quality of the food over the years. It is imperative on part of these restaurants to constantly monitor the quality of their servings. Considering the fact, that these are not any other fast food joint or run-of-the-mill restaurant, they must pay greater heed. Peter Cat is still a great crowd puller for its Chello Kebabs, but I was thoroughly dissapointed with what was served. The kebabs were dry, the rice hardly had butter and it seemed as if the food was served with haste.
People look forward to eating here because these are heritage places reminiscent of delectable Calcutta food. They need to buck up.
P.S : All those who have not been here, its a must visit. Avoid weekends.

Food was good. Try the Grilled Fish and the House Special sizzlers. The Chicken Steak was nice, the mutton stake was more like a mutton hamburger stake. Staff were friendly. 

However I was quite appalled at the cloth table napkins. One would think that a restuarant of this caliber would take better care. They were discoloured with black streaks... sad. Management please step up, don't let these small things put off your customers.

I do not remember the number of times this place since my birth. This restaurant will take you to the era of the seventies when Park Street was frequented by the Bourgeoisie. It has become a heritage restaurant which is a must visit place if you are on a visit to the city of joy. The most popular dish is Chelo Kabab (both veg & non veg). It is a persian dish which is served with Persian rice with butter, mutton sheekh kababs, chicken rashmi kababs, an omlette. The rice along with the butter melts in your mouth to give you an ambrosial feel. even when i am writing this review my mouth is watering thinking of the aroma and taste of the chelo kabab. The other favourite dishes of mine are Veg au grating and chicken steaks. 
Several waiters and stewards have been there forever... ready to serve you your favourite items from the menu of the restaurant.

Food : Good  but not great, the chelo kebab is tasty, but very insufficient in quantity.. As are all the dishes on the menu. 4/5

Price : Not cheap, but the food isnt worth its price 3/5


Ambience : Pretty much par for the course..  3/5


Service : pathetic..a place where waiters demand and harass you for tips. Enough said.  0/5

Some places are there in your city, which you are programmed to love, right from your childhood.Peter Cat for me is one such place.Most of my happy eating out memories as a kid goes back to this place.¬†And today, as a grown up, this place is the one where I go to relive my childhood.The taste of Peter Cat has never changed.¬†The ambiance remains constant too.Albeit, today there are many new eateries in town, but this oldie still remains one of my favourties.As for experimenting with the dishes here, I've never felt the urge to have anything else other than the iconic Chelo Kebab or the House Special Sizzler.Why would I want to eat ANYTHING else here when these two dishes are clearly paradise on a plate?¬†To sum up, I would rate Peter Cat a perfect 10 for the amazing food, ambiance and service.

Only negative is when you go during a Friday or Saturday night and you need to wait for sometime before you can get inside but the food actually solves any problems you had faced waiting outside.
Try chelo kabab... The prized menu of Peter Cat... also it has very good Sizzlers...I just love them...awesome good... you can even try the Chef's special menu which is also good. I think you will get the best Sizzlers here in the city.. Also can try the deserts which are also pretty good...
The ambience is really good... Service wise it is also very good... The waiters are usually very helpful and attentive.. They will give you a proper idea of the time one need to wait to get their food and then you can dive in.. If you need anything further just look around someone should be waiting to take your new orders.. Simply fallen in love for this... ????

One thing of park street,  which any foodies will not miss in a lifetimes.  For the starter every one goes there for chelo kebabs.  Which is itself like a historical food.

If u happen to be in Kolkata for even a business trip, none will leave without dining once at this place. Such is the aura n the legacy. Located at park Street you will have to wait in a queue to get a place here for dinner.  I love the lighting and the decor and the warmth of the staffs here.
All time favourites are
Chelo kebab - pure bliss in form of different kebabs n rice n butter n egg.. Full meal by itself 
Prawn cocktail - a cold dish served in a glass.  Heavenly to the last spoon
Mixed sizzler - if u happen to sit near the serving area,  ull see a sizzler come out every 2 mins.  I like the mixed grill sizzler the mos which has everything 
Fish muniere - when I want to try different, I have this.  Yummy fish cooked perfectly 
Caramel custard - one of the best in town

Wat do u do when it is 4:30pm , u r near park street and most of the restaurants r closed for lunch service and u r super hungry !!?!?! Well is joules straight go to peter cat. Not only is this place open for service all day long but it is also the only time of the day when u will instantly find a table.
The moment u sit down order for chelo kebab.This is their most popular dish and is served within 5 to 10mins. And it is delicious !!!

Nothing can be said about their signature dish--kebabs. But the sizzlers of Peter Cat are mostly overlooked. They are mouth watering and delicious. Chicken steak sizzler is great.

I thought of giving it 5 but the possibility of achieving perfection restricts me from doing , so I settle with 4.5 
Sometimes being a critique you start thinking of negatives , but if someone says that about Peter Cat I assure that person is nitpicking . 
Coming to the basis of reviewing  I rate based on food , ambiance and service . Value for money is just a mere function of the above with a positive relationship.
Getting started with the food I must say that being a Vegetarian you more often than not have few dishes to order . So keeping the limitation in mind I would rate it as one of the best North Indian food serving restaurant. That's pretty subjective I suppose but you gotta taste it to believe me. 
Since I order a fixed menu,out there my usual choices are Chelo Kebab , Sizzlers, Tomato Soup. If its not sufficient go for  the basic Indian order . The taste of the former dishes are distinct and you surely exercise your taste buds and trust me this is a workout we would all love. 
Without getting too much rhetorical and coming to the ambiance its my favorite. The dim lights and the dark surroundings makes it a good combination. I simply don't like Italian marbles with too much lighting hitting your eyes. So full marks for its decor.
Service is good and it hardly matters when you go for dinners . 

So is it value for Money, I think so it is and plz don't listen to those who say for vegetarians its not ideal.

Peter cat is a class restaurant serving excellent food. Of course the only thing which comes to mind is the Chelo Kebab but apart from it there are really some attractive and delicious a la carte food items. Ambience is great and grilled and Indian food are too good to taste. What is better is that they have special areas for smoking and alcohol.

We found Peter Cat food is not as great as it appears to be on Zomato. We ordered Dum Ki Run and Fish Makhmali Kebab for starter followed by Chello Kebab and Tandori mixed grill sizzler for two people. The portion size was generous. However, all the foods were very salty except Makhmali kebab which was also the best among all. Contrary to the legend of Chello Kebab, I found it a simple assortment of butter rice, Sheek Kebab and Chicken kebab. The Sheek kebab was very ordinary. Though the chicken kebab was better than the Sheek. The sizzler although was visually very appealing but taste wise was not something to die for. However, the ambience was good and so was the service.

Located in Park Street - Peter Cat  is one of the oldest & prestigious restaurants of Kolkata.

Almost every foodie in kol knows this place so i am not writing anything abt its 70's like decor & atmosphere which is obviously great. 

The menu is extensive the golden cat shaped menu card still stays same as it was yrs ago.

The vegetarian food didn't had too many option in sizzlers. In fact to b precise only 2 option are available. V ordered both vegetarian steak sizzler looked amazing but tasted okay. Nothing great. But other was good .

Serving time is quick and drinks were served almost immediately after order r u. The temperature was just perfect. Waiters were friendly . 

Overall not a bad experience.

Peter cat is one word for excellence. I cant recall how many times I have visited dis place.the Cocktails make my day. Mu fav being screw driver. The others r bloody mary n amazonia.. as I love vodka. N u must team dis up with fish makhmali. Whats authentic n tastes great is the chelo kebab. Among the sizzlers its tandoori mixed grill is what I recommend to u. Or u can simply go in for the house special where the livers r so well cooked. Among desserts its the creme caramel that I love. Or u can go in for the meringue with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate. Its so good. M planning a visit soon.

The hype is more than what it deserves. Yes, food is good. But there are way better ones too. Chelo kabab is "legendary" but it is not whay it once was. The quality has deteriorated over time. And waiting outside for two hours for seating seems way too much for what this place has to serve.

Food: Enough options to choose from. Had ordered Mixed Grilled Veg and Non Veg Sizzlers. I have had better sizzlers at cheaper price before. It was rather sweet and bit boring. Quantity was more than sufficient. However, rates are now much higher than before. The menu in zomato is an old one. I rate it 3.0/5

Ambience: Ambience is not bad. Dim lights, simple music, simple decor and giant traditional staircase. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Very good service. Got prompt responses from over-burdened waiters, because I went there in peak time. I rate it 4.0/5.

Overall I would say, do visit but do not order sizzlers.

I don't know why people are so crazy about the Chelo Kebab in Peter cat. Neither did I like the taste nor  the service...it has a huge sitting place and is very crowded.However the sizzler tasted good..the waiters and ambiance will give a similar feel like Mocambo,but in terms of menu  and taste..MOcambo is better than peter cat.
Its not reasonable as well,i found it costly in terms of  food and quantity.
If you really want to taste kebabs ,visit BbQ/Flames ans Grill nation instead and have a tummy full of delicious kebabs.
we hope we get to taste something really good next time.. ;) :)

Another old premium restaurant located on Park Street, the food they serve is absolutely lip smacking. You always have to wait in a long queue to enter this place, but its worth the wait. The sizzlers and the famous chello kebab is to die for. The ambience here is old world, with dim lights and service is as quick as it can get with a full house. 
Inspite of all the new restaurants opening up in town, Peter Cat hasn't lost its charm.

I agree it was good, but not "GREAT" as many locals and travel brochures told me.
Beware of the queue and mismanagement on weekends, even if you manage to get in somehow, they will keep you waiting even for a beer, forget about food!

This is one restaurant you have to visit once in your lifetime. Now most people will think here is one more Chelo Kabab fanatic. No no no. I seriously think Chelo Kabab is very much overrated. But you definitely you have to visit it for the Dam ki Rann. It is an absolute delicacy that lives you in a tizzy. It is one of those dishes that sends you into that place where you feel you have to eat more but your tummy says there is no more place :D :D. 

Pros: Great food, decent ambiance, decent service
Cons: The wait time to get a seat at the table

But to my good luck i and my frnd gt a seat immediately as we entered(coz it was jus two of us ).The ambience is good..with dim lit surroundings. Service time was also good.. we had heard a lot about Chelo kababs ..so we ordered one veg and one non veg..and boy it waa tasty !!! So wer the broccoli tandoori we had fr starters... cost was also ok...with jus 1100 jus fr the two.. i must say...this is place to visit. I am definitely going again to try their awesome Sizzlers about which i hv heard a lot .... a big thumbs up frm me.

Had to wait for the customary half an hour before getting a place. I joined my friend later so I could skip the waiting part and get to the eating part directly. The ambience is nothing to write home about.

While the kebabs they ordered were good, though in parts the thing that left a bad taste in the mouth was the constant query of if we were done by the server. If he could get us the check and kick us out too. I don't think I am going back there. If I want to dine somewhere I would like a little more respect.

One of the oldest and the most famous restaurants in the city. So it does not require a testimony prove its hospitality and the quality. Food is too good in here. The famous is the chelo kebab amongst the foodies of Kolkata. The good thing is that you will not be forced to finish off your meal if there is a crowd waiting for a meal for hours outside.

The Chelo Kebab of Peter Cat is well-known, but most of the people don't know about the exquisite Sizzler they serve. Peter Cat is one of the restaurants which provides value for money. The Chelo is such a wholesome food! It's always advisable to end your meal with a yummy chocolate soufle. The ambience always reminds us of our very own Park Street. The only problem is you'll have to wait to get a table, almost whenever you come. On the other hand, it proves that even in the age of buffet meal, Peter Cat is one of the most preferred restaurants in the city.

Peter cat is synonymous with long queues. It is situated right in the bustling Park street and very easy to locate. I am new in this city.However, have always heard about and its signature dish'Chelo Kebab'platter since a long long time. This is on my wishlist as soon as I shifted to this city and more than eager to experience the magic. It was a saturday and it made it more busier than ever. We,four of us, got in after a wait of almost 2 hours. The ambiece felt iconic. Right from the dim lighting interior to the dress code of the staff transported me to the colonial times. I was astounded to see the number of people sitting inside and hogging into their plates. As expected,we ordered the ever famous chelo kebab. But, I was ghastly taken aback!! The disj to me tasted next to other ordinary dishes. The mutton seekh kebab was too dry and flavours didnt do much to me. Overall, it seemed overhyped and overrated to me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I guess it used to be that oh!so mouthwatering and delicious before.But, for  a first time taster, it drowned completely.

I simply LOVE their Sizzlers!! Be it Tandoori Mixed Grill or Grilled Chicken or Roast Chicken, I am fond of all of them, House Special being my personal favorite. However, I do not like their signature dish Chelo Kabab much. The kababs are a tad too dry for my liking, I like my kababs to be juicy and tender. Their soups and fresh lime soda failed to impress me.

chelo kabab and chicken stake sizzler, chiken tikka kabab are some of the fav dishs of mine.the chelo kakab is the national dish of Iran,  it  consists of steamed rice with butter, egg porch, 2 types of kababs. 
The chicken dtake sizzlers is another fav dish of mine , the chicekn stakes are really tender and tasty. 
Only the problem is that  in the weekend, this plae become very crowded and have yo wait so long in a queue.

My friend and I visited Peter Cat on 1st June 2014. While billing, my friend's debit card was swiped twice by the person at the counter and he ended up paying double the sum. When it was brought to the notice of the management, they casually replied that these types of error are common and that the money would get refunded within 72 hours. After a week, when the money was not credited back to the account, we went to meet the manager. A person named Hansel told us that we have to wait for 15 days to get the money back since we had used a debit card and that they would talk to the bank to hasten the process. My friend again contacted the restaurant on 3rd July 2014 when he was told that he was misguided about waiting for 15 days, but since it has been more than a month, a letter has to be sent to the bank and then only, the money can get credited. He is still waiting to hear from the bank and the restaurant.
       It makes me wonder how such a reputed restaurant can be so callous towards their customer. They should know that their responsibility does not merely end with the food. A casual dinner ended up as a harassing and stressful experience that we had not anticipated. I don't think I will ever visit the place again.

Went there a long time ago , had friedrice and chicken .the place has the best environment i have witnessed . the staff are nice and friendly. the cleanliness is upto the mark. The other customers are mostly officials and businessmen as there are a lot of offices nearby . its a good to be with colleagues and family , not the best place to be with friends and having a care free behavior.

the food served was hot and steaming and great.. no problem with that . 
The expense was a bit on the high side actually , but no complains as overall I enjoyed being there

Well the best part of going to Peter Car is to wait for a table. I have doing it for 20 years now and will continue to do so.  Completely  lost count on how many times must have visited this place. 

Chelo Kabab has always been a great favorite.  Chicken Tikka, Grilled Fish, are indeed divine. One would want to live for some more years only to eat the good food at PETER CAT.  They have a great dim light ambiance. The place still carries the Anglo-Bong- Bhodrolok tradition. The team is so polite and takes care of you well.

I wish i could rate the 6 out of 5.

Hope to be there again soon.

PLEASE BE AWARE of the Queue and absolute mismanagement on Weekends and this is especially for 'COMPLETE GENTS GROUP' (Manger's word). 
This was my first visit here with friends in recent times . I have come here before with family, long time back but never in the recent few years. I prefer Mocambo and Bar-B-Que over any other joint in park street anyday. 
Coming to peter cat: The Manager as well as the Management feels the money that 'only male group' gives isn‚Äôt money.The kind of treatment that I got from peter cat was by far the MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I reached PETER CAT with my guy friends expecting a wonderful Saturday but little did we know that this would turn out to be such a sour ordeal. The wait was a total of 90 MINUTE PLUS (despite turning up at 19:20 Hrs.) and of course no waiting area. So we were standing there waiting for our turn in the streets, sweating profusely because almost any PARK Street joint refuses to take down the number of a customer and give a call or sms when the seats are available (Why Do that? Let these poor humble customers suffer and yes it‚Äôs a SIN cause you are at PETER CAT in all GENTS groups let them suffer more. It kinda gives them pleasure and definitely heightens their ever-growing false pride and ego). Initially the manager said 20-25 minutes wait, which I thought decent enough in any park street joint but eventually the waiting period kept on increasing and then finally came our turn after some 90 ODD MINUTES. 
‚Ä¢	AMBIENCE: As Expected it was good. People eating and chatting in a joyful manner (read noisy), and yes definitely they conquered there way in the holy PETER CAT. We were made to sit at the last possible corner of the ground floor. Thank God the AC was working (nothing else matters after the wait).
‚Ä¢	SERVICE for food: Again a lot of waiting which is natural considering the restaurant jam packed (it‚Äôs a common scene in any park street joint so cant really complain).
‚Ä¢	FOOD: Ordered Beckti Meuni√®re: The quality of fish was good but the taste overall was very mediocre. 
                              Baked Chicken: Taste very plain, I‚Äôve had better baked chicken at other places including my home. The dish wasn‚Äôt that creamy. It felt pretty normal, nothing special considering the hype of PETER CAT.
                               Some Veg Dishes like cauliflower roasted and one other item. I didn‚Äôt taste them so cant really comment and 
                              Non-Veg Chelo Kebab: It‚Äôs the most hyped dish here. It basically consists of Rice, Butter, Minced Mutton kebab made on Skewers, Chicken Kebab (Boneless cooked again in skewers as a piece with green pepper and onion in between slices) and Egg sunny side up placed carefully over rice. This was the only thing that cheered us up a little I guess because of the beautiful presentation. The Platter looked marvelous. It was a perfect plate with Meat and Rice to devour. The taste however was again good but not the best of the kebabs. Anyone who‚Äôs a fan of lucknow Kebabs will agree to what I said. All in all it was a visual delight mainly.
                                     Veg Chelo kebab: I didn‚Äôt eat so have no clue, but my friends who all actually ate said the paneer was soft and good. One of them was not at all satisfied though. Not my words.
‚Ä¢	Pocket Pinch: Average around Rs. 800 per person including drinks.
To SUM UP the whole experience of PETER CAT turned sour mainly because of the extremely poor management. One may say that I could have left the spot for some other restaurant but the manager kept us waiting in the lieu of offering us a seat very soon and by the time we realized it was already 20:00 hrs. which automatically means there would be rush hour in other joints of park street, so we were all trapped by the cunning manager.
I request the Peter Cat management to kindly change their ridiculous philosophy of treating men different from mixed group or ladies only group(be it large group with mixed sexes or ladies only, all were given preference without even thinking twice about the group of 6 waiting right next to the door). This is a proper restaurant and but I‚Äôm afraid to say that they follow policy of a Discotheque with a ban on stags. It is my earnest request to all the restaurants in park street to change there attitude towards men only group. I must say here that in other joints at least the manager has the courtesy to say the approximate waiting time and then it is upto us to decide. PETER CAT has simply failed us miserably. Nobody expects to pay and wait 90 minutes for a table. I repeat its the worst experience and you know these 6 people will spread the word in a GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION. 
I request PETER CAT to respect people‚Äôs time and MONEY otherwise gradually people will loose respect for you.
PS: There were many people who were equally frustrated.  Also MY LAST VISIT @PETERCAT. 
ADIOS!!!!

One of the classy places in kolkata for dining in. Book a table beforehand. little bit on the expensive side but worth the money. Must try their chicken asparagus soup , sizzlers and ofcourse the legendary chelo kebab (must for first timers). Service is good . Ambience is pleasing. Varieties of cocktails but have to pay a little extra than other local pubs.

Finally after much wait we were able to visit the much famous "PETER CAT" located in the busy Park Street. The cool ambiance was an immediate relief from the humidity outside and we were quickly escorted by a pathan dressed attendant to a table nearby. Without much delay we ordered for a fresh lime soda, chelo kebab and a "house special sizzler" , two of its talked about specialties.  The Fresh lime arrived first , quite fresh and tangy and was gulped down quickly. The Chelo kebabs lived up to their expectations and are infact a meat  lovers delight. The kebabs were well prepared with the right amount of spices and were presented well with a portion of rice and half fried egg laid neatly over the platter. The kebabs were quite juicy and well cooked. The sizzler was served hot attracting onlookers from nearby tables adjusting their sights to the sizzling noise as it made its way to our table. The sizzler was decent and was well cooked. The chicken sausages added a spicy tinge to the otherwise buttery chicken in the sizzler. The portions of both the dishes were adequate to fill up a hungry human.  Overall a pleasant experience with quality food and hospitable staff. A place not very heavy on the pocket but offering a good family ambiance. We look forward to visiting the place soon again.

Nice place to have food. You have to wait a long to get a seat. Famous for its Chelo Kabab. Ambiance is also quiet good. Location- heart of the park Street.

Cost- 900/- for 2 persons approx. (without liquor)

Peter Cat is famous for it's cheilo kebabs and hell yeah, those kebabs are totally out of the world. served with buttered rice and egg, I had never had this combo before, and I really liked it. A must have in Kolkata. Tandoori potatoes would be a delicious add-on. I would've rated it 4.5 but I am taking away a point for long waiting queue and mismanagement and poor arrangements for the customers who are waiting for a table.

Nice food. Had All time great chelo kebab ... though I am a biryani fan. Reshmi kebab was awsome. But the restaurant in charge was kind of snobbish. The waiter was greedy and did not leave the table untill I gave him a tip.

Too good...its worth spending here...the ambience is good, service is good.
The speciality of peter cat is chelo kabab and that is palatable. Apart from chelo kababs other foods are also too good and delicious . this is a must visit restaurant. The starters and cocktails are also good and not priced heavily.

In our school days we knew this to be the costliest restaurant. Never dared to set foot before getting a job. However when i visited for the first time i was quite surprised to see the experience was highly value for money specially when compared to the new age restaurants popping up in malls around the city. Because of the food and the location convenient from both sides of the city, this has been the favourite restaurant for a friends gathering outside office. Elegant ambience with the uniformed waiters reminding of the bygone era, plethora of nicely made cocktails and the ever appealing Chello Kebab never lets this go out of fashion. Even took an Australian client for a lunch and he was  mightily impressed.

Peter cat has been a perfect choice  for my whole family for all these years . Everytime i remember there is a family dinner peter cat was by default everyones choice. The sizzlers are really the best thing available there along with the chellos. I must admit the chello available here is the best that i have tasted till now throughout kolkata

I had to go to Peter Cat almost 5 times in the last three months to be sure that the review that I give them is based upon consistent experiences of their food and service. The first experience was too good to be true so I just had to be sure.

The place has a HUUUUUGGGGEEEEE queue at almost every time unless you turn up really early in the evening. There have been a couple of times where I have had to wait almost an hour. Every single time, the wait has always been worth it. I will not talk about their service, which is not BAD, but isn't anything to write home about either. They know they will always sell no matter how good or bad the service they provide, is. Do not go here if you are expecting service. You may not have to wait more than ten minutes for your drinks. OR you may just have to wait more than half an hour to give your order after you're seated. Their food though, is an entirely different story.

Their Indian Mughlai food is good. I was able to taste some of their vegetarian staples like Dal, Paneer and Rotis, etc. but they have been consistently good. All their chicken and vegetarian sizzlers were wonderful with just the right quantity and flavours...they've been wholesome and hearty meals I have enjoyed everytime I tried them. However their Chelo Kebabs are absolutely fantastic. Most of the time I have had their Chicken Chelo Kebab staple which is the reason why this restaurant is well known. The portions are enough for one person as long as you don't make the mistake of ordering entrees. The kebabs are always perfectly cooked with the right balance of flavours. The combination of the kebabs, rice and salad in single mouthful is absolute genius on the palate. I say Chicken Chelo Kebab STAPLE because that is what sells the most here...unfortunately.

What motivated me to write this is this - their Mutton Chelo Kebab is simply the best 'combo meal' I have had till date. The mutton kebab is absolutely melt-in-mouth with (and I cannot stress this enough) the PERFECT amount of spices and marination in the meat. On previous occasions I had only ever ordered the Chicken Chelo Kebab, and because the standards it had set were so high that I was wary of trying anything else...but I was so glad that I did.

I am now converted, and if you haven't had their Mutton Chelo yet, I'm sure when you do, you will be too.

One of the best restaurent in park street area to taste the vintage calcutta. the inside ambience, stuff's wardrobe will give a feeling of the heritage city. Regarding food, i have tried chelo kabab, chicken marakesh, fish sizzler, chicken sizzler, roast chicken, grilled fish. every food items are very tasty. still i would suggest to must have sizzler, marakesh and chelo kabab over here, it's like they are the pioneer of these dishes in kolkata. in drinks, they have a very descent menu. i never heard "sir, we don't have this drink" from them. 
considering the cons, their price is on a higher side, but they never compromise with the taste and quality. also the biggest problem is, if u are planning to go on weekends, u have to wait around one hour in the waiting queue. but still my recommendation is "must go", else u are really going to miss something...

one of the most popular places across the city, and is worth the effort too. have never been there and got a place right away, there is always waiting. Ambiance  is like a upscale, but not modern, service with the waiters and tables and service all feels very 80's but in a good way. the atmoshere is comfortable and well maintained. the wonderful thing is that the service very very prompt and the restaurant is well maintained now comes the food, the main reason to visit, the kitchen shells out some out of the world combo, its not just the food but the plating and the combo that makes the visit awesome. the food here never goes wrong. i have been multiple times could not help myself to try a lot of stuff as the "chelo kebab" an ala carte dish and complete by itself always tempts me away. a simple plate of butter rice with two different kebabs and some assortments always sets me up. sounds weird but i am a big fan of the vinegar dipped shallots that is always placed on the table, overall a 10 star experience everytime.

One of the pillars of the food mecca of the city , I cannot even remember the first time I visited the place. All I can remember is , nagging my cousins with the question Why is the restaurant named after a cat and being too afraid to touch the sizzler imaging it would be dead hot ! (Stupid me :( ) Family celebrations , Nabami lunch , cousins gathering .... Peter Cat it was and it is .In spite of new eating places coming up in the city that is lost in its own time , I  seem to have a bias towards this place.

The white walls , the maroon carpet , the old stair case , the dark interior , the contrasting dim lights , sizzle sounds and a low hush-hush........ this is how I would describe Peter Cat to a first-time-in-Calcutta-n. Me and my 3 other friends... S,P and another S visited PC today in the afternoon for lunch.After a 3 min wait , we were given a table upstairs.We ordered our usual - Chelo Kebabs and Steak sizzler.They took quite some time to serve us our food but since its PC , never-mind !! The Chelo Kababs were fantastic as usual .... but what disappointed me ...was their chicken steak sizzler.The chicken wasn't soft enough and the sizzler totally lacked taste. Not the kind I expected to have.The last time I had the dish,the chicken had a soft juicy taste to it which was completely absent today.

For desert , we ordered the brownie with vanilla ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce.They serve the sauce in a small copper kettle like thing , which is great to look at. The dish was perfect with the wafer in it and the brownie was pretty soft .So...kudos to it !!!!

Peter Cat is a place beyond comparisons and beyond reviews.So .... wateva it is ...its a must visit place for every Calcuttan !!

Peter cat the name us so familiar ever since your childhood but never expected to be a restaurant on a hustling busting street with long cues groups of people waiting to dig inside and call it a meal in the heart of the city Park Street. The restaurant stays full from the time they open till they close. Its an old place who has been catering to a million by now and now connected emotionally to a million. They serve seriously good food and make you enjoy your gala time. I had ordered the special dish which has an equal legacy as to the place
 " Chelo Kebabs" My apprehension as a punjabi could not make me understand the presentation of the dish and neither the  combination,but once it went to the mouth it touched down straight to my heart and that to very hard.Steamed rice with Seekh kebab and Malai tikka with dollops of table butter and sunny side egg as a garnish the combo is a divine and meal is a hit. Peter cat is also famous for their Chinese delicacy and fruit beer. But to all the first timers if kolkata then Peter cat and if Peter cat then
 " Chelo Kebabs " .

Keep hunting on the ground for a delectable palate.

Cheers

If you like that distinctive sizzle coming from your plate , the smoky aroma, the crisp flavors then no other place serves a better sizzler in Kolkata. The place is quite crowded even on weekdays so do reach a little early. Try their variety of kebabs including the all famous chelo kebab which is jst delicious. Dumm ki rann is also a must but try this with people backing u up cause its quite a big portion. But don't leave without trying their sizzlers. The taste is just heavenly.

I just simply love this place. The food, ambiance and the decor is very nice. One must eat the Chelo Kabab and the House Special Sizzler. For cocktail the Whiskey Sour goes very well with this combination. 

Pro: Excellent location. Good Ambiance. Very nice food.
Cons: The staff needs to learn to be more friendly though. Also the wait time is very high.

good decorations but they are pathetic with any food beside the famous chello kebab. We have had taken fried rice for a change instead of chello kebab and we were served a portion which is even small for 1 person. the taste was miserable. In short the only thing which  is possibly edible there is the chello kebab and some of their starters

Only thing i can say about this place is its all about food especially chello kebab and sizzlers . 
I have visited this place many times that too alone only for its chello kebab coz its really the best and enough for one person n it will only cost u around 400 bucks for one person for that one perfect complete lunch or dinner . 
I have tried grilled chicken sizzler n the chicken was really nice tender soft plus the bread rolls are really nice and yum . The staffs are quick and responsive . 

The only issue with this place is getting a table it takes minimum of 20-30 mins to get a table plus they don't even take phone reservations . Waiting is something which is really gonna turn u off if you are really hungry . 

So i give it a 4 .

This is controversial. To criticize a Kolkata legend and institution isn't my objective and im sad that i must.

Peter cat had its day. But it needs to catch up! The food is good. But when a cockroach runs across your table. And a second one is killed by the waiter in front of you, who shamelessly acts like its no big deal. Its a DEALBREAKER. 

Clearly they are only running on past glories but such disregard for quality on the table. I don't know what the kitchen must be upto!

Not worth the hype anymore.

Well. It is counted among one of the best in Kolkata and rightly so. I have been there quite a few times and my favourites are Chello Kebab ofcourse and Chicken Butter Masala or something. I just cant remember the exact name in the last and the Kima Nun. Its fantastic. Well. Price is neither THAT high nor THAT low. Okaish for most. Ambience is top notch and service too. Quite happy with it and that is why I am quite fond of this place.

Being a Delhite and a lover of Mughlai cuisine .. I have had many types of kababs.! This surprise package aka Peter Cat offered something.. Which made me realize that.. "Haamika peter cat ke kabab khooob bhaaaalo bhaashi" and the "chello kabab" are any day.. Farrr way better than.. Any kabab.. I have ever had! 10/10 in taste..flavor and presentation! Amazing! 
We also ordered betcki meura( something like that) ! It was gorgeously cooked! Juicy and succulent fish! Very rich in flavors ! And pretty nice presentation! 
The ambiance of the restaurant is decent enough! The dim red lightning and enough seating capacity are icing on the cake.! 
I was though little bit pricked upon by the service! The staff needs to be more friendly! A (-1) for that! So work upon that! As apart from food.. It is the most vital aspect of a successful running restaurant!

The legendary Peter Cat at Park Street. Its no use being a foodie and living in kolkata,if one has not visited the Peter cat. 
Peter Cat has been serving kolkata's foodies for more than 70 years. 
So i bumped into one weekdays afternoon for lunch with my friend. 
The red lights and the old staircase just adds the feel of old times. 
But for me it seemed like a average restaurant. Very average decor only the hanging lights were impressed me.
The place feels a bit low maintained , and i hope that they would upgrade their decor and also retained there 70s feel but with a modern twist. 
Coming to the foods we were two people,so we ordered chicken steak sizzler and there famous " Chelo kabab ".
The chelo kabab was average, it didn't tasted any good, apart from nicely decorated presentation. The rice was simple butter rice comes with kababs and pouche on the top with a portion of salad ( But the butter rice was great ) 
Next the Chicken steak sizzler which was served quickly. The strange thing is that they don't serve bread with the sizzler which was bit surprising to me.. The sizzler tasted good but nothing great. 
The service was quick,but the waiters wasn't t friendly.The price was quite decent, for two people with alcohol it cost about 1500.
Overall to me this restaurant is over hyped place to eat in Park Street surely have better place than this.

I have been to this restaurant almost 20 times.Three words to sum up this entire restaurant would be brilliant,exquisite and  authentic.Brilliant service,exquisite decoration and ambience and the food is simply delicious.
As a matter of fact I have grown up with this place,and remember almost every moment I have spent here-be it a date,with my family or friends.
The reception at this restaurant till the time you leave (though you will never feel like) is simply outstanding. Speak of its brilliance,talk about its food, Peter Cat tops the list any day.
Initially the Prawn Cocktail used to be my favorite when I was in the 5th grade or so,but my choices changed as I began to explore their delicacies.
The Chelo Kebab was the first one that fell in my hands,and I can proudly say that nobody on this planet an make the Chelo Kebab in a super manner like this restaurant.
If this is your first time at Peter Cat never miss the two dishes I just mentioned.Otherwise opt for the Chicken Sizzler if you wish to.The quantity of food is quite good at this restaurant.The bar requires a little makeover thou, but otherwise its a 5/5 for me.

Peter Cat maybe a legend.. and the food maybe good (which is why it got the 2.0 I gave it), but what about hygiene.. we were having dinner towards closing time, and we saw a huge white rat. Disgusting, that the owners wont even take care of such basic hygiene issues. When brought to management attention, some say there was a pest control exercise that morning and rats might be coming out for that reason, and one other smart alec goes that there are rats in all restaurants in Kolkata! I am sorry if I am offending anyone who swears by this place, but do think twice about going here again.

Peter Cat is always the first place to visit, mentally, when I go to park street. But the entrance of it is absolutely ridiculous! There is always a lot of crowd, whether there is any occasion or not.  People queued at the entrance shout saying ‚Äúhow long do I have to wait?‚Äù There is no need for it, as there are numerous other restaurants now in Park Street. The food quality has deteriorated, but the crowd keeps increasing day by day. The wait of 1 ‚Äì 2 hrs is not worth it. Drains out the excitement and energy of spending a nice time with your closed ones.
Nevertheless, the famous Chelo Kebab is something I definitely need to have when I go there. Sizzlers are not great as before, but decent enough at the price they offer.  I love their Mixed Tandoori Sizzler.

Cost for 2 in my case: 700 approx (without alcohol), 1200 approx (with alcohol).

One of the top 3 restaurants in the Park Street area, in terms of recognition....The place has become somewhat of an legend for the youth of Kolkata...good to take a girl, u wanna impress...warm and cosy atmosphere with just the right amount of chic...the cocktail list deserves a 2nd look with its quirky descriptions of classic mixes...the chello kebab is something that is always cooking in the kitchen... The food menu is short one, im impressed by a restaurant which is so famous and has been keeping it short and simple in terms of menu for such a long time. It means they mean business... The 1st dish- The Bhetky Meuniere, wasn't impressive at all.... The dried out, just over fish fillets were served with cheeze that's just enough to coat the fish...on one side...the butter lemon and parsley combination of the Meuniere was strangely missing....the only hint of freshness was the small slice of lemon on the top for decoration....the sides were equally uninteresting.... The potato was under, and size that looked a bit gross....beens and carrot made up the rest of the the dish.... Next came the Tandoori Prawns.... I have to say it that's a new version of the age old classic. A spice staffed prawn with just a bit more shell than I like, and with a taste that reminds u more of chicken reshmi butter masala than a tandoori smoky earthy seafood. The quantity on the plate was good. Next came the signature classic chellobkebab...the standard quantity of rice with a couple of mutton seekh kebabs, Chicken sasliks, some butter cubes and a poached egg to top it all...the dish was as usual perfect.

If you are looking for good service. A strict no-no, the service is terribly bad. Bad service is very disappointing for me. 
Food, other than kababs are just okay. 
Peter Cat has lost its sheen and quality. I never thought I'll be rating it 1/5.

Been here a dozen times and this is one of those places which hardly needs a review. An excellent place to go for a meal whether you are with your family or friends. The low lighted ambience and quick and polite  service is highly commendable and the food served is probably among the best found in the city. The menu presents a variety of  continental and north Indian choices my personal favorites being the Chelo Kebab platter and the Chicken Steak Sizzler. They also serve several innovative desserts which add to your satisfaction after an excellent meal. Overall it is cost effective and one of the places you just have to visit if u r in d city. The only bad thing is you can never get a place here without waiting but believe me when I say the wait will be definitely worth it. 
Conclusion: its simply awesome <3
So go and give it a try foodoholics!

Peter Cat is famous for Chelo Kebab. Now Chelo kebab is the national dish of Iran. Here it consists of steamed rice(with a blob of butter),egg poach, kebabs and salad. Along with that we ordered Tandoori Mix Grill(sizzler), Masala Kulcha, Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Shahi Korma and Biryani Ala Nawabi(chiken biryani).

Each and every food were equally delicious, mouthwatering and extremely yummy!
The biryani's chicken was boneless(served two big pieces and an egg). Their service was amazing. We were served very nicely and we totally enjoyed the meal.

P.S. Please try their biryani because it is totally out of the world!

Living in Park Street for a while i have been astonished by the crowd outside Peter Cat. Theres been a queue for almost the entire week that i have been here and i had to try it out. I went to Peter Cat after having a couple of drinks at a nearby bar and its ambiance did impress me. I ordered the Famous chelo kebab. Peter Cat has already created a big hype in my mind and maybe i expected too much when i entered. I also tried the irani Kebab. There was a huge crowd till about 10.30 pm on a weekday. You have to visit Peter Cat if in Park Street. Go through the entire menu and end up ordering the chelo kebab. Its great food and great place.

This place needs no recommendations. It is popular, has not fallen in its food, quality or ambience since I started going there 20 years back. The Chello Kabab, its USP. With the fine assortment of veggies and meat, the chello kabab is probably the best in its category. But yes, one of the drawbacks, not due to restaurant's fault obviously, is the sheer appeal of it and the crowds that flock to it every weekend. You may have to wait several hours. And going there during the pujas without prior reservations is suicide. But once you get in, well it is sheer brilliance.

Wanted to check this place out for their chelo kabab. Had chelo kabab and a sizzler here. Food tasted just okay and nothing special. Even the attitude of the waiters are not up to the mark. The cold drink that they gave seemed to be kept in open air for quite a lot of time. So experience was not good.

The ambience gives you a feel that you have gone back in time....
Regarding Food I guess it doesn't require a testimony.

Note: if you go there , do not by any chance miss out on chelo kabab

One of the oldest & prestigious restaurants of kolkata. Located in Park Street. The location, the crowd, good food & wonderful waiters with their vintage uniform, their hospitality, always a favorite in my opinion.
The Chello Kebab, sizzlers are wonderful here. They have a unique taste & the quantity is also very good. One other dish is worth mentioning, that is Fish Munia. Two betki filet soaked in butter & creamy gravy. Just visit this restaurant & see for yourself how good the food & ambiance can be. Just to warn you, the restaurant pulls a lot of crowd on weekends. So there can be a queue. Cheers !!!!

Peter cat a name synonym with etiquette! situated in the heart of park street this place still bears the aura of the 70's dining ambiance...the owners being cricket lovers named this place  after a cat who lived in the Lords cricket ground in London! I recently took-out my friends for lunch on my birthday and we had an awesome experience! The food..they are delicious and mouth-watering! Sizzlers + chello kabab with a brewed drink.......are all time win-win! The servicing is also good. The interiors are something which makes the entire place interesting...those red hanging lamps add to the otherwise modest intramural. It is an expensive eatery but what i can assure is that you get the value back...i have been to other expensive one's but the quantity i got here was definitely better!! So i will strongly recommend all the foodies out there to try for this one(if they didn't yet)! #HappyEating

Today, 5th June, 2014, I visited Peter Cat on the occasion of one of my friend's birthday. I have dined here 'n' th times since my teenage. It is legendary restaurant that has been my all time favourite.

Its all positive about this restaurant. The location...the ambience...the food...all are A+. I had the all time favourite "Chelo Kebab" which was like everytime I have had it...awesome. 

Peter Cat being a well known place to Kolkatans...there is nothing much to write...just all praises for it.

almost every foodie in kolkata knows this place...so I am not going to write anything about its decor and atmosphere which is obviously great as has been for the last decade or so....
the food however has degraded a bit...but its still good enough.
the sizzlers are heaven and the chelo kakbab has always been the all-time fav.

The food taste is  just awesome,
The best dish  I liked the most was "chelo kabab" which was just mouth watering and I never had such superb quality of rice anywhere in India.
And when I saw the bill, I found it decent enough for such good quality food.
Best part is they also serve beer !!!!

A trip to Kolkata isn't in any way complete without a visit to Peter Cat. This legendary eatery on Part Street just opposite Times Furnishings has been a stalwart in its own right when it comes to food. 

The menu is extensive, the golden CAT shaped menu card still stays the same as it was years ago and the sizzlers still make their way out of the kitchen with that crackling noise we Kolkattans are all so familiar with.

The review and the experience is just one of the numerous trips I have made to this favorite eatery. It was Jan 2014 and for us bengalis who stay in Delhi for a living, it was not cold at all as per Delhi winter standards. We reached Peter Cat around 8:30 at night and could not manage a seat outright...there were at least 5 families waiting before us. After about half an hour and repeated requests to the manager....we got lucky. 

I always prefer sitting upstairs ..where the seats overlook the seating on the ground floor. It was a cozily lit corner table and we ordered Prawn Cocktail, Chelo kebab, chicken sizzler and chocolate mousse. Peter Cat has never ever let me down...loved everything we ordered and returned home a happy and contented soul.

Peter Cat- its nt just another restaurant bt a brand in itself!! Famous fr their sizzlers and chelo kebabs, Peter Cat is very conveniently located though parking is a big issue! Rest assured u wl have a waiting time of half an hr no matter whethr its weekday or weekend! The ambience is superb with the sound of sizzlers amidst chitchat of diners, servers quite traditionally dressed and ok i wud say (nt d mst polite or professional) , food is of exceptional quality! One of the best places to eat in Park Street undoubtedly!
Bt thats where the story ends. Kolkata is now nuch beyond park street! There are excellent restaurants in almost every corner of the city! Peter Cat must evolve itself if it wishes to continue competing against the trending ones!! Hoping that its future wl b as glorious as the past!

This is the second time that I have visited this old Kolkata restaurant. To be honest, first time with their highly rated chelo kebab I was a little disappointed. Every time I visit this place I get those old Kolkata flavours.... dim light, cozy sitting, simple decor, thick velvet carpet underneath and old wooden staircase.... 
Their reception and warm behaviour have always touched me  and this time their food also left a long lasting flavour on my palette. We were just passing by this place and just couldn't resist myself from visiting this one and only place once again. As we did not have any hunger, we just ordered two soft drinks and beckty muniere. Serving time was fast and the temperature of the food was just perfect. It is a complete meal. Truly the food was awesome, out of this world and lip smacking. Certainly they won our hearts this time through their foods. In that classic 70's ambience I fully enjoyed my food slowly but surely, a sweet tune of piano what was missing, would have been the icing on the cake.
A must visit place in Kolkata. 
They maintained their food quality and originality and this is the USP of this place. 
A little complaint - the table was at times clumsy, table space was short and too many things on it. Table should be manager in a much better way.

P.S. - Their sizzlers and kebabs are must try, better than chelo kebab.

In Kolkata, Park Street is synonymous with great food. One of the restaurants there, Peter Cat is quite good. If you are into a dim kind of ambience you should like the place. Just as you enter you get a retro feel.
But if you don't, you should go there for the food. The food is really good. The speciality I guess has to be the Chello kebab, because just as i said Peter cat, my friend told me that I have got to try the Chello Kebab. It lived up to my expectations. The succulent mutton seekh on a bed of rice with butter topped with a sunny side up. The vegetarian food wasn't great. There weren't too many options for vegetarians in the sizzler and kebab section.  We also ordered a Vegetarian Steak Sizzler which was okay. The vegetarian Chello was nothing great and the paneer in it was bland. But still, I personally like the place and the food. 
P.S. If you go, do try the Mutton Chello Kebab. :P

Peter Cat.. Well whenever I hear this name juz one thing passes by my mind and its 'chelo kabab'. Being a vegetarian i have munched the vegetable chelo kabab but have heard from my non-vegetarian friends that the non-veg is more yummier. Whenever you visit this place chelo kabab should be must on your table, i have been there thrice and only chelo kabab could satisfy me. I have tried the biryani nentara and the proper north indian food but that was just average. the ambiance isnt that good, quite dark inside but the lamps on the table however makes it look good. The location is perfect not hard to find it out and it is pocket friendly,not quite expensive. A good place to catch up with your friends.

I still remember when I visited Peter Cat. It was the last day of year 2012. We waited for almost 1.5 to 2hrs and then got chance to enter. We ordered chicken soup, chelo kebab combo and antiquity blue. The chelo kebab contains some rice with 2 butter cubes, 6pieces of chicken kebabs, 2pieces of long mutton kebabs, 1 slice of cucumber, 1 half boiled egg. This combo is enough for one person.

It was just yesterday, when I went in for a chicken steak. And I was disappointed in ways more than one. This review may well seem like I was there to only find faults.
It was a busy time for business, and I thought I walked in to the cool place I had always known Peter Cat to be. The decor was so delightful, the dim lights around the walls and the red lampshades over the tables. I was looking for a decent chair, and was shown all corners as I was alone, that too in a very unpleasant tone. Understandable, that it was business time and you being the management would try to accommodate as many eaters as you can. But there has to be someone to see its done with grace. Caring for guests is important.
And then finding a seat , placing the order and admiring the place I noticed a pile of files or something next to the billing counter. Such an eyesore. And then the ugly crates next to the bartender killed the premium feeling. Further, I saw a waiter picking snacks from the little wooden snack bowls to fill his hand, at the bar. Outrageous.
And I wondered, as it seemed it was only yesterday, a few years back when I first visited this place and fell in love with it.
Ok, the food. The plate was beautifully decorated. It was colourful with steamed beans and carrots, the dark sauce on the steaks added contrast, and the smell was pickly. Perfect. The knife didn't have an easy time through the chicken fillet, it could have been a lot tenderer. In the mouth it just tasted like deep fried chicken dipped in arrowroot, and garnished with the amazing sauce. It was an Ok meal.
The conduct of the staff needs to be evaluated. And it is to be noted that the past glory is not be basked in but to be preserved.

Old world charm, dimly lit, no fancy decors,  a familiarity that calls me back countless times, this joint has been serving calcuttans for the longest time. While they serve up quite an array which includes Indian, continental, Mediterranean I stick to my prawn cocktail, mutton chelo ( I used to think nothing beats the original chicken chelo kebab but for red meat lovers amazing option) sizzlers. Do not expect authentic chelo or prawn cocktails. These are absolutely peter cat signature flavors and beats the authentic on any good day...

Peter Cat. The most unusual thing about this is its name. I was surprised when I heard it for the first time. I am still wondering why should anyone keep this name. Starting with the ambience, (this is a general observation by me) almost all of these "premium restaurants" have one thing in common, if the interiors are not impressive, make the restaurant dark and hang colourful lamps over each table.This strategy really works. I have read many reviews saying that the restaurants had awesome interiors but when I go to check them out, what I see is the dark restaurants with contrasting lamps. Moreover, I had been to Mocambo restaurant on the opposite road of Peter Cat which has the same interiors (By interiors, I mean the lamp hanging above my head). I have attached the pictures of the HANGING AMBIENCE. Coming to the food, there was nothing extraordinary. It was regular restaurant food. We were a group of 10 people and tried almost all cuisines available. The service was good. Now comes the value, it is an expensive restaurant, but I have seen restaurants much more expensive than this. But still, the rates are much higher than it should be.

HANGING Ambience: 2.5/5
Service: 4/5
Value for money: 2/5
Taste: 3/5

There was a time when Park street used to be the food Mecca of the city. While it still is, there are other streets in Kolkata which have sprung up as new food destinations. Take Sarat Bose road for example. Still there are people like me to whom park street would never loose its relevance. To me to still is THE best food destination of the city. Full of good old memories, my food experience starts on a high note the moment I enter this street. And why has this street found such an important corner in my heart, is because of the 3 stalwarts in this area, namely Peter Cat, Bar b Que, Mocambo. You can call me partial, but the moment I eat something from these places, my ratings travel east bound. 
When I was a kid, I was a big fan of chinese food and when my father took me to this place for the first time, i was very disappointed to see no chinese cuisines in the menu card. That was my first and last moment of disappointment in this temple of taste. No special mentions, stuff yourself up each day with different items and your taste buds would live forever.

If you are thinking of just hopping into this place without standing in que then that's an impossibility but the wait is definitely worth it. The well known signature dish is chello kebab but to be truthful I was let down by it. Tried prawn cocktail and grilled beckty and they were heavenly. In the mains chicken mayonnaise with bread is awesome. Generally you will have to wait a bit longer for chicken mayonnaise but trust me its worthwhile. If you are in the mood for north indian dish, then mutton nawabi is the thing to look for with a biriyani. Overall its a very good place to dine in.

Have been there several times. At first i was fascinated by the true Kolkata feel it had, the old Kolkata charm. 
The restaurant is dimly lit but offers a cosy dining. Waiters r ok.
Peter cat is known by its famous chello kebab, which to me is way over hyped. Its an assorted kebab platter with bed of buttery rice n poached egg. The egg is often over cooked n it doesn't ooze out when cut, like its supposed to.
Bt the meat is tender n juicy. A good dish Bt nothing to die for.
I wud rather order a chicken sizzler n cold salad. Good restaurant for the "oh so Kolkata" charm it has Bt a bit overhyped to me.
Price is on the steeper side.
On festive days be there as early as possible to avoid hours in the queue.

D ambience n grandeur matches the spot's legacy of surviving through ages. Never miss the steak sizzler there....those are one of the best sizzlers i have had till date. And most importantly the staff is really helpful n friendly. It can be a date with history, if u manage to grab a good seat here. So reserve the seats prior to ur arrival. Enjoy!!

One of the best restaurants in Kolkata according to me in terms of price and quality. A heritage restaurant you may say, it welcomes you with old british architectures and thick carpets and wooden furnishings. Peter cat serves excellent sizzlers, Chelo Kebab, Chicken marakesh, Prawn cocktail to name a few.However i dont find their Mughlai dishes that good as their continentals. It tends to be crowded in the weekends inspite it being a pretty big restaurant, so reservations are recommended if you are planning to visit with family. The prices are quite reasonable also. A must try if you are in Park Street area.

I have tried many things from the menu and got settle again with chelo kebab as its a meal on its own for a light lunch and if you have skip dinner due to heavy party night on saturday then its a Boon. Please remember to block seat and visit and staff is old so be nice to them or else they get angry ;)

Take the Calcuttan out of me, and I will probably not see any greatness in Peter Cat. Chelo Kebab which is their signature dish was first introduced by them to the ubiquitous rice-eating bengali. It is a plate of buttered rice, with an egg (sunny side up), and some generously thrown in mix meat kebabs. The global Calcuttan like me who has been there done that will take the license to say "well, what is so great about that?"...So yes, the sizzlers, the very indianized, cheesy, gooey continental fare, the Chinese, the Indian is not 'great', albeit the first of its kind that this city has known.
Then what makes it so special? So it is the old-world park street charm that comes alive in this Calcutta Restaurant - the colonial flavor in the decor, the stiff collared ushers and waiters, the dim lighting...Everything about this place is oh so Calcutta.
So if you are a first-timer in Kolkata, do visit Peter Cat, for its an experience like none other.

A stature to Kolkata's delicacies. The Chelo Kabab platter serves as a benchmark through out India. And not to mention its sizzler or steak is a true challenge to your taste buds. The mouthwatering sound and the aroma of butter served over a special "sizzle" table top paper. The Chelo kabab platter derives its name from - "Chal-o-Kebab"' which means rice and kebab . And no Kolkata foodie would dare to jump over a dish if its Chelo Kebab . Adding to the attractive menu is its innovative and bud-popping cocktails , especially the " Zam Zam" or the "Peter Cat Cooler" . The daring combination of Whisky and Rum is a true challenge for boozers . All together its a worth dining experience doing justice to your pocket.

There can be very few restaurants that one knows before their consciousness arose. Perhaps Peter Cat is such an one for me ^_ ^ I was brought there way back in 90's and even today in 2014 people still going gaga over it. 

Having an avid desire for North Indian foods I do like the dishes quite a bit. You can try Fish Farah for a change as a starter, the fish they served is soft, tender and delicately mixed with spices. Biriyani is spiced up really well and by that I mean its too heavy for one person to have a go at the whole plate, rather it will be good if you share this just to taste and do not expect this to taste alike other biriyani's of the town, it is different. What I really liked is the different type of Nuns they offer. You can try Kabuli or keema nun with the wide range of side dishes they serve. Sizzlers are quite famous here as well, they taste decent and looked even better when served. And last but not least the Chelo Kabab is the most ordered dish they offer which is quite decent but something I feel a bit over-rated. I have had better chelo kabab at almost same price in some other place.

Ambiance is decent if you are new here, is awesome if you have certain past memories. The prices are very much reasonable but wish to be served with bit more smiling faces. It is cosy and nice if you are really early in the evening or be ready to sweat it out in the long queue in front of it :)

You have to wait way too long for a table. There a limited number of dishes. They lack variety. The food is average! Service needs to be improved. Serving time exceeded more than 45 mins! A plus point is the ambiance!

Famous with the kolkata folks for the chello kebabs and sizzlers.. Chello kebabs were quite good even the veg variant. Perfect place to spend sunday afternoon if you are looking for good food with a few drinks..

I have been to peter cat a number of times as it was a 2 minutes walk from my previous office. I like this place a lot. Its ideal if u r willing to chill out and booze. apart from the drinks I always wanted to try something else on the menu but every single time I ended up having either Chello Kebab or a Sizzler. But I was satisfied every single time.....So Cheers to the CAT.

The moment this name comes to my mind I can only think of one thing "CLASS APART". Be it the ambiance, the food, the service or the price no one can beat it. One of the oldest places in kolkata Peter Cat is famous for its sizzlers and not to forget "Chelo Kababs" . The kababs are soft, juicy and pretty much for a single person and it will not cost much on your pocket! Sizzlers are equally good! Surrounded by a line of good restaurants Peter Cat has always lived up to its reputation and i can guarantee it will continue to do so!!!

well i dont think theres nothing much to write about this place because this place is a real winner when it comes to lazy weekday/weekend dinner...whatever you order in this place as per me it will be good and a bit different from other joints...still now when i  or in that case anyone remebers peter cat chelo bells definitely rings in our mind and taste buds as well...other than that there are so many other dishes that you can crave for like chicken makmali, chicken irani kabab,afgani chicken,chicken marakesh,dum ki raan(depends on the meat though),persian pulav...even the cocktails you can try, it wont be that great but not bad as well...service is bit a concern but thats understandable...expenses - its definitely a budget retaurant...gone so many times even i dont remember but definitely waiting to visit again ASAP....

peter cat needs no intro at all...One of a kind restaurant for having continental & north indian food with sophisticated ambience.
Location:-
In the adjacent lane of flury's, opp to park Street KFC.
Ambiance/Service:-
I went there on 25th December with parents for lunch, as we wanted to avoid d rush n long queue at nit.But dat didn't help at all.
We had to wait for half an hour.But after that, we placed our order n the service was really good n fast.The waiter n manager both were very cooperative. Indoor was dimly lit and decor was good.Romantic Ambience. :)
Food:-
For starter, we ordered Fish makhmali kebab as suggested by the waiter himself, n believe me dat was really delicious with a melt in a mouth feel.we washed it down with jaljeera n lemon soda.
Now, for main course, we ordered 1 chelo kebab (chicken), 1 Grilled fish sizzler, 1 mutton biryani, 2 pc.s nun and 1 chicken curry, alongwith green salad.
chelo kebab is there signature dish and a personal fav of mine.A very filling dish...awesome. ..grilled fish sizzler is also very tasty...served on the bed of lettuce, with sauteed veggies, it was a combo of taste n health.Mutton biryani was ok, a bit oily with succulent pieces of mutton n potato. 
For dessert, tutti fruity ice cream we had, a decent dessert that looks enchanting....
Overall rating :- 4.5/5
Surely visit fr some more delicacies n chelo kebabs too..:)
A worth try for foodies.

Everyone says PT is good known for its cello kabab,,,This dish is serve with 2pic of mutton cello kabakb 1 sik resmi kabab 1 egg pouch n butter rice...Look nice, test nice...
But I would prefer here sizzlers...They serve the best sizzler in kolkata.Pick any sizzler n you would not upset...
Other dishes are also very good...U can try Fish Malai Kabab for stater...
Drinks are also good.
But U have to go there with 30-45 min extra time after 6p.m. coz every good test comes with some time sacrifice....

Famous for its Chelo kebab, Peter Cat has been one of the most visited joint in Park Street. I recently went for a lunch date there with my besties and did not really have a very great time. The food was wonderful. We ordered a great deal- fish fingers with french fries and the Raan for appetizers. It was so tasty that we could have gone for two three repetitions. But the problem was that they served the main course with the starters and by the time we started with the tandoori rotis and the chicken, it had become absolutely cold. The service was bad and we had to keep helping them to make space on the table as they were going on piling food items. No sense of timing really. Disappointing.

Worst experience ever in any restaurant I have visited till date !! To begin with we were four friends I reached 2 mins ahead n asked for a table for 4 the person on the gate n then the manager asks me have all the guests arrived I replied saying they would come in a couple of mins say around 5 n the pathetic reply that I can expect from any restaurant is that they will give me a table only wen all the guest arrive till then I keep waiting outside to seek a table !!! Wat nonsense is this utter shit !! 

Then comes the turn to order food , heard a lot about their signature dish chillo kebab so wanted to try that out and ordered for a veg one ultimate waste of money it was they didn even serve the mint chutneys along with !!! 
  
Never ever shall I do the mistake of getting myself insulted by such people who don't knw how to treat their guests bt want footfall !! Hell plz friends never go there !! 
And u don't deserve a rating not even .5

Have heard about this place from each and every guy in Kolkata, so went there on weekday afternoon with pretty high hope.
The place was full, but luckily we got place for 2x people in 2nd floor. 

The decor was nice with deemed light and nice light music. Ordered the famous CHELO KABAB to start with. Now come-one...whats so special about this dish ? I got confused. It didn;t tasted any good, apart from nicely decorated presentation. The rice was simple butter rice to go with. Have eaten better kababs in bangalore in any small eatery!!!

Next was Chicken steak, which was served quickly. They dont server rice/ bread with steak whcih was little surprising. This was tasted ok, but nothing great. 

The service was quick, but the waiter was not very friendly. Overall, to me, this resto is a OVER HYPED place to eat food. Park Street surely have better place than this.

Yumm Chello Kabab and mouth watering sizzlers along with the brilliant shrimp cocktail, Peter Cat in park street is the place to be. The food is not very expensive yet too good to taste. The only flaw, which may be the pride of the place, is the immense waiting queue. But I believe it is worth the wait. 
Though bookings can be done in the morning, but a strict time is maintained.
Love this place.

I have been to this place twice- once during durga puja and the 2nd time for celebrating a special day :) And both the times I had an awesome experience. The ambiance is so good. The staffs are nice. The food is simply delicious. The first time I opted for grilled chicken sizzler and sweet corn soup. The 2nd time I decided to have chelo-kebab which is their forte. I was so very impressed by the quality they offer that i genuinely feel that a trip to Park Street remains incomplete without paying a visit to this place. :) :)

One of the oldest places to dine in park street and yet a favourite. You dont mind standing in a queue and waiting for few minutes to occupy a table. Hot favourites: chelo kebab, fish and chicken sizzlers, kebabs, mutton rogan josh with garlic naan and one can try some very good desserts like soufle and caramel custard. The only thing that makes people come back is the consistency in the quality of food and the service. The waiting time is very low so that makes peter cat a great place to dine if you are at park street. Also its not v pocket pinching unlike most restaurants these days.

Park Street and Peter Cat seem to be synonymous and for good reasons too. The wait may be a bit long, but definitely worthy. We were quite a big group of 7 people but everyone had not yet arrived. We discussed this with the usher and he led us to a table for 4 and promised to shift us to a bigger table once available. We ordered kabab platter of the day and various drinks to go with it. When the rest of our friends arrived, we were shifted to a bigger table as promised. We decided to order Chello kabab and special sizzler, which we shared so that each of us got half a plate of each! These two dishes need no praise as they are indeed winners by their own rights - I personally loved the sizzler. The bill was moderate - overall value for money and more!

My experiment with truth er food in Kolkata started with Peter Cat, an iconic restaurant. Chelo kabab is the signature dish and the owners can rename the place as the Chelo's . My another havemust at PC is the prawn cocktail. Peter Cat captures the through essesnce of kolkata, sticking to the old beliefs yet beat the modern. The wait for tables is worth the kabab and the sizzler.

With all the hype about peter cat I believe the Indian food is a little bit disappointing while on the other hand continental food I good. Tandoori prawns were simply excellent on the other hand steak sizzler was decent enough. If you go to this place have Tandoori prawns for sure and a sizzler ( grilled chicken or chicken steak). While the Indian food was utterly disappointing. The Nan's were cold and chicken wasn't up to the mark.

Was there to celebrate a certain achievement. Situated right next to the music world, the place from outside gives you a vintage feel. Since it was a Friday, had to wait for half an hour to get a seat. Inside, the ambience was great. Didn't waste much time and ordered for Chelo Kababs. The mix of rice roasted kababs, Kathi rolls, butter and a poached egg was magical. Add to it the flavorsome of a well roasted salad. The rice helped in breaking the jinx every time. 
Next order was a chicken sizzler. Smoking hot stuff, served with a poached egg again, this was a treat and again lived up to its expectations. The sauce was subtle and great, and I just devoured on it. Trust me it is quite tough to gorge on this after the Chelo. But then, it was a day to devour on godliness. 

Verdict: definitely go an eat what I did. Definitely visit the place for the name of it, for the food they serve. Me? Yeah, I'll be around.

This is one of the happening joints in Calcutta, always there a long queue, and the only sad part is they don't accept reservation! They can improve some more on the service as it is very cold at times which dampens the experience! Prices are considerable and not that expensive at all. Great food and drinks, cool ambiance and prompt service. Love it every time I go. Must try the kebabs and sizzlers they make it fab. Oh yes there Chello Kebab, just search on this page about it most of em will mention it, MUST try!!

I didn't quite like the Sevice as it was slow and the waiters were disinterested .. The food was average nothing spectacular .. Maybe it was just prevalent for that day .. I was not much delighted with the experience wAs expecting a bit too much ... Let's c whether I get a better experience next time ..

Undoubtedly any noob's Shubharambh to the Heaven we call Park Street!
Chelo, Sizzler although the all time favourites, there's a preparation that's very under-hyped-Marakaash!
This Chelo-alike dish has both Chicken and mutton kebabs and in almost 1.5 times the quantity in Chelo. Once experimental, now it is my regular.
In the Sizzler department, Peter Cat is my absolute favourite by miles ahead of any other. They don;'t add rice, pasta, noodles to their sizzler and make it to heavy on the stomach. The combination of boiled veggies with some yummy sauce on the well cooked meat makes it a dish, which you can eat regularly without ever getting bored.

I have been a regular at Peter Cat since i was a kid.There's something about park street, its amalgamation of the old and new,how it blends both together to form something like a worldly experience.
Any foodie in Calcutta would easily recommend you this place,and why wouldnt they? This place has been serving lip smacking sizzlers and kebabs since so many years.
My most recent visit(29.03.2014)  however was a little disappointing, not on the food front but the service front,let me clarify. 
The waiters seemed disinterented :/
Our order was the veg chelo kebab which was so so so good,like usual :) Next up we ordered the vegetable mixed grill, a sizzler so divine, with impeccable flavours.My taste buds are so familiar with these flavours * gushes* We also ordered fresh lime soda sweet and they served us sweet and salty! We asked them to replace,"yes ma'am plz wait" and thats what we did, waited and waited :/
Also hygiene was something of a concern that day!The plates and water glasses were not properly cleaned, resulting in small tiny whitish things floating in our glass of water,inspite of being poured from a bottle of packaged water.Also, since we were hosting a friend from mumbai there,it was quite embarrassing :| So my rating of 3.5 is only because of the food i ate, and because its Peter Cat im rating!

I have been going to this place since childhood and i absolutely love their chelo kebabs....their sizzlers are also good but nothin is as good as their chelo kebab.....After having given up meat my option of having chelo kebabs has been cancelled out...so last time i went i tried the grilled fish sizzler...the fish was really good ...though they could have given a bit more sauce to have with the veggies and it could have also been served with bread rolls or garlic bread as the 2 pieces of fish fillet along with a few veggies is not so fulfilling for me :P

Famous for their Chelo Kabab.... steamed rice with kabab topped with dollop of butter and one poached egg... devine.. I also like their grilled chicken aka sizzlers... but Fish Makhmali Kabab is probably the best dish they ever served... its mouth watering... dont forget to taste their vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce... its just fantastic

Well... Well ..... One place which never disappoints you and make you desire to comeback shortly, is Peter Cat. I dont need to speak bout the Chello kebabs & Sizzlers out here as half of Calcutta knows how good they are at it. But IF you have missed on the chicken marakesh and fish munia they serve... next time out there dont miss them.
A childhood favourite which still stands out to be one of the best restaurant Kolkata offers.

Recently had gone to peter cat to have my favourite dish. The most disappointing thing that I saw was the waiter's and the doorman's uniform. Peter cat is earning so much money, couldn't you do them a favour and buy them new clothes. Fresh ones. The waiter's coat had a hole is his arm pit. Like seriously. Is that how hospitality looks like to you. I am hoping next time I come I see that implemented.

Schizzlers and Chelo Kabab(for which this place is so famous)--we tried both--to be honest--the mutton shiekh I did not like that much-- so much Ihave heard of Chelo Kabab here but I was not that much satisfied--apart from that all the other items were delicious--hats off to their Schizzlers--dont remember if anywhere else I had them better than here-ambiance was excellent  and staffs were very polite. This place needs to be visited multiple times.

Peter Cat! The name stands as one of the heritage eating places of Kolkata. Getting a table here without having to wait, is almost an impossibility, and if the number of people in the group is large, God Save You :D
But this place is definitely worth the wait! 

The chelo kabab is the signature dish of Peter Cat. What looks like just a little rice would absolutely fill your stomach once you are done with the entire plate! The mutton kabab, the chicken the egg, the butter, even the capsicums are just perfectly made. 5 on 5!

I personally find the quantity of chicken sizzler, which is another signature dish of Peter Cat, a little too less. That might be because I am an avid fan of chicken. Never tasted the dessert s here yet but the Paneer tikka kabab of this place is heavenly, and underrated. You also get a lot of choices in drinks!

I have been told that Prawn cocktail is another specialty of Peter Cat and I must try that next time.

Over all, a wonderful place. A must visit if you are or are not a native of Kolkata. We were made to sit on the inside section of Peter Cat once and I did not like that part. So, even if takes a little waiting, try and sit on the outside section and if you are lucky or in a bigger group, you can sit on the first floor which is prettier! One warning, since this place is so well known and famous, the service can be a little rude. The food somehow makes up for it.

Oh! What a fabulous experience it was. Unmatched taste. Beautiful ambiance. I loved how those lamps hung above the table. The legendary platter- chelo kebab was just awesome. I loved how the caramelized onions took the kebabs to another level. The reshmi butter chicken was great too! I am deducting 0.5 ,because I feel that the service could have been better..

Even though the CHELO KABABS is the most popular dish here, I always find the House Special Sizzler more fascinating. It is one of the best place to have sizzler. If you are an Indian food fan, try the tandori's and the afgani chickens. The ambiance is not the best in the world, but with a decent cheap price this is a popular restaurant to try.

Went to this place on last Friday. Grilled bhetki was not up to the mark. Being a very cheap restaurant Vesselka made it very tasty and worth comparable. Coming to there signature dish Chello kebab, everything was good about it but the mutton kebab. It was way too spicy. Then had grilled chicken sizzler which was okay. No difference b/w the garnishing of grilled bhetki and grilled chicken. I would suggest all the sizzler lover to visit Mocambo for their variety of sizzlers.
And yes the waiters or the floor manager always staring at you and whatever you do,which was quite disturbing. They were not letting you have your privacy.

Peter Cat is part of Kolkata‚Äôs heritage. Its‚Äô Chello kebab has gained an iconic status which is unforeseen for any other item of any other restaurant. The concoction of buttered rice, poached egg and chicken kebabs and mutton seekh kebab is really unique and filling. You will have to wait for at least 5 minutes before getting in on weekends or during lunch time. Over the years the place has deteriorated a bit. They need to renovate this place ASAP. The vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce is another indulgence. I really felt bad when I visited last month and found this place shabby. My north Indian friend was visiting kolkata for the first time so she could not understand what the hoopla all about is.

I live in Delhi but over the past 4 years on my visit to Kolkatta I have never missed this place. This place needs no recommendation to be honest but feels great to see the buzz around one of the places I personally like to eat at. Though what I can suggest people is a prior appointment or Table reservation at my every visit I have been kept waiting for almost 30-40min since they are most of the days on my visit are completely packed. And I am never too sure of my visits so I never thought of any reservation until now while writing this review. 

I remember we first went their for the Love of Sizzlers they serve. And from then onwards there was no looking back. I had Chicken Marakesh at my first visit and it was heavenly. You talk about their Prawn Cocktail, the Chelo Kebaab, Baked chicken Hands down ! The chicken they serve is moist and loaded with spices just the way I like. They have ample choices of drinks when to go with your food. 

And now that I am writing and reminding myself I am so dying to visit this place again. :)

One of my colleagues enticing me each and everyday and asking me to try Chelo Kebab was the reason I visited this place.

My review on Chelo Kebab: 
The kebab and rice are really delicious and is the reason one will revisit this place. Really loved it. But the mutton kathi kabab was nothing compared to the chicken one.

My review on Peter Cat:
Nice restro at a good location, even better ambience

It was my maiden visit after hearing so much about this place. Got along with a colleague of mine for a lunch. We had no idea that we would have to wait for so long to get a table. My friend was in mood for something Indian. We were very hungry and coupled with his choice for lunch, it completely got out of my mind to have their signature dish: The Chelo Kebab. Anyway this is what we ordered: Fresh Lime soda, Roast chicken for starters, Chicken Liver Masala, Chicken Shahi Korma, nan and tandoori roti. The food arrived pretty fast starting with the roast chicken, which was descent enough. The Indian dishes were in fact below average. The Shahi korma was a very simple dish with chicken in a soft gravy along with big potatoes and an egg. It also tasted bland and needed a bit more seasoning. I have never had liver masala before and hence I didn't know how it was supposed to taste. I had a bite of it and didn't touch it for the rest of my meal. I have never experienced tasting chicken liver so bad as this was. This place is certainly not apt for having anything Indian and certainly nothing innovative is going on here. But I do hope to come back soon, just for the Chelo Kebabs....

It was the utmost worst experience for a person when yiu order your food and sit back gor more than forty minutes for the same to arrive......while on taking the order you are promised only twenty minutes for the same. Drinking coffee was a feeling of disgust when your cup and saucer is served in front of you and you find the edge of the saucer broken......Have been visiting Peter Cat since for a good span but now with the passage of time the restaurant have degraded itself drastically......Very bad experience on food , behaviour of the staff...Try to avoid if possible from visiting this place .

Peter cat is dying ... I visited the place several times and tried out almost all there cuisines. I liked the "baked chicken" ...it was really delicious... Once I ordered for Sizzlers and I swear to god , I will not dare in my life to try it again. There sandwiches are too pathetic and I am very sure that the cook never had sandwiches before in his life. I was truly dissapointed.

I don't know why people praise about this place so much. Yes the food is tasty along with ambiance and hospitality but the price is just too much. They say that Chello Kebabs are their best dish. But I think the dish could be far far better. If you have to spent that much money on a romantic date with your Lady then I think Park Street has better places for you than Peter Cat; take for example Mocambo. Go and dig into some real good food and authentic continental. But Peter Cat is just an overrated place in my opinion.

I love this place coz of its my most favourite chelo kebab which is its best innovation..I have tasted im many other restaurants but noone can beat petercat's one..their chicken steak , grilled fish, house special chicken sizzler are extremely filling and the quantity is appropriate for a single person..
It is quite cost effective..and when it comes to my fav petercat cost doesnot matter..their special desserts are too good and their tuti fruity ice creams add to the sweetness..
I would die for their chelo kebab which is awesomeee and the best in the world...:)

Among the most popular restaurants in kolkata with two signature dishes-The Original Chelo Kebab and The House Special sizzler! Located at the prime park street area,this place is always crowded,even during weekdays.
Ambience 8/10
Similar to mocambo,you get the orange hanging lamps and the comfortable couches. There is a separate section on the first floor as well. The menu card is cat shaped!
Food Presentation 9/10
The prawn cocktail is served in a special chalice which keeps the temperature down. The sizzler is served on a separate serving mat and the steak alongside stir fried vegetables. The chelo Kebab looks pretty impressive with all the chicken kebabs forming a semicircle around the butter rice!
Food Quality 8/10
The cocktail  is really tangy with generous mayo and soft prawns. The chicken steak sizzler is soft and tastes good! The chelo is pretty good but not as exceptional as is the hype about it. It's just regular kebab chunks and mutton sheeks with rice and cubes of butter and a poach. The shah nauz was a bit chewy and had too much liver to my liking. But overall it was nice.
Food quantity 9/10
The chelo kebab is sufficient for one person. It is a wholesome meal. Even one serving of sizzler should suffice one person.
Cost effectiveness 7/10
Well this place has seen a hike in prices over these few years and nowadays chelo kebabs of similar quality are available at reasonable rates at some other restaurants also. But you'll surely have a memorable experience once you visit Peter cat.
Overall 41/50

Chello Kababs, that's about all you need to know before you go, simply the best place to have dinner in Kolkatta, Peter Cat is famous and they justify their fame. The place feels classic, the staff and service is always good, the best part is that its exactly the same as it was years ago, (An uncle told me this). Prawns at this place are another delight, which just taste exceptional.

I seriously don't understand why people are so much crazy about this restaurant.....I visited Calcutta for the first time and after seeing so many people outside this restaurant I decided to give it a try. So firstly you need to get your name written and wait for your turn. Accepted....but if you are without a family then your wait is even longer...ok so family takes priority over you...now if you are group of bachelors then you need to wait till someone from the bachelor section comes out...and moreover the no of People coming out from that section should be the same aa yours...so if two people came out and you are four then any two bachelors below you would be on priority. Now talking about the food I won't write muxh ...it was good but not worth the wait. And above all after being irritated so much you actually won't bother how the food is....

I feel silly writing a review about Peter Cat...after all...it's reputation precedes it. But it is one of my favourite restaurants and I've lost count of how many times I have been there or have ordered food from this amazing restaurant. When I yearn for spicy food (or sometimes even Continental) I head for Peter Cat.

I passionately recommend the following:

Indian Section:

Non-Veg Chelo Kebab - it's a given, but there is no parallel.
Dum Ki Raan
Mutton Shikar Kebab
Tandoori Prawns
Prawn Butter Masala
Chicken Shah Nauz
Non-Veg Tandoori Platter/Sizzler
Tandoori Broccoli

Continental Section:

Prawn Cocktail
Fish Fingers with Tartar Sauce
Beckty Muniere
Chicken Steak
Grilled Fish

This is a price-conscious restaurant and they deliberately keep their prices low. I wish they would increase their prices and improve the quality of a few items - especially the fish. If you are a regular there the people recognize you and usher you into the first available seat. Otherwise there is a big line, even on weekdays. I also wish they would serve a better selection of Beer and Scotch. The ambiance hasn't changed in decades. It is crowded. But the food more than makes up for all that, and perhaps it adds to the charm of the place. 

This place doesn't need a recommendation, nevertheless, I do recommend it most sincerely to all our fellow foodies.

It‚Äôs no use being a foodie and living in Calcutta, if one has not visited and then talked about peter cat at least once!
Peter cat has the incredible power to hang onto the 70s vibe in an unabashed manner. The red lights and old world staircase just adds to the feel. The wait to get into this place on a weekend is maddening, so come in plenty early and with people who you can bear to chit chat with for some time before you‚Äôre granted entry. So definitely not a place for formal setups or lunch with colleagues.

I only go to this place for the chello kebabs, I have never ever had anything else on the menu. Does that not say everything about the chelloKs? I have tried both the veg and non-veg versions of it, and though a hardcore meatatarian, I would still prefer the veg platter over the non veg. The rice which comes along with the kebabs is flavored with salty butter or salt and butter (I am not that evolved to understand the difference), but the rice is great.

The place feels a little low maintenance, and I wish just sometimes the dated d√©cor would be updated to retain the 70s feel but to bring in a modern twist to it.

This place is has the old charm and cheap drinks going for it, more than anything else. It's time they reinvent a few things, but again having an appeal already they don't need to do anything. 
The other day, we had a very bad experience, we were out to celebrate a friend's birthday, but neither would they offer us a birthday cake nor would they let us cut one from a different place. This is a ridiculous rule and they ought to make exceptions for birthdays etc

Food is average not upto the standard..Infact cochroaches were found on the table.
The hype of the brand "Peter Cat" is dying..and to save this they should improve the quality of food and offcourse the cleanliness.

It is one of the better restaurants from the sea of restaurants that speckle the very busy Park Street. Minimal decor and dimmed light gives one the comfort of gorging on to one's food uninterrupted. Well if this is your first time then you might just want to reach early at this place because it gets crowded really fast....should be there by 1 for lunch and before 8 for dinner unless of course you fancy waiting outside or to turn around and march into KFC.
The chelo kebab was exquisite a few years back and then it became great and now its good. It is served with buttered rice and a poached egg accompanied by chicken tikkas.... a wholesome dish in itself that does not require any starters to be ordered.
i am more of a fan to the chicken sizzler served with a delicious sauce and some veggies. Now this is the dish that was and still is delicious. 
The rara mutton is well cooked and well spiced which makes it salivatingly good if you are not in the mood for the above dishes.
And then there is the prawn cocktail which i think is just about average here...if u are craving one go to Mocambo...its their forte.
desserts are well...um...ok.
But trust me once you have had food here u wud want to come back and your pocket and some of your taste buds would agree.

Been there recently for sister's wedding treat, a party of 10 people including the first timers of the splendid experience  ! One of the best experiences of food and company . The assistance is courteous and really helpfull to choose the right stuff according to your taste . The chelo kabab is very famous and i have tried dat earlier as well . This time the experience enhancer was the mixed tandoori sizzler.The kaleja fry is superb for meet lovers . I dont knw hw do they manage to create the same taste every tm.

Very famous in Kolkata peter cat is situated on the busy park street . The day unfortunately was valentines and they took no bookings or reservations , we landed up to see at least 50 people standing outside .... we didn't wait and came back the next day for lunch.

Seated promptly and ordered for Chelo kebab in lamb - the lamb was soft and juicy with the butter rice and with that 3 pieces of chicken which looked like malai tikka. loved the chelo kebab ... have eaten this at quite a few restaurants and yes it was on the top with the others. 

CHicken reshmi - kebabs juicy and soft my daughter enjoyed them with butter naan's . I ate a couple of pieces and they were definitely good . 

Chicken biryani - the way biryani is made here is different and has potatoes in them . the biryani was good had all the flavours right and chicken was cooked well ..... 

Didn't have space for desserts. 

I rate this place 4.0 and wish them all the best

I visited to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was too good.

We tried some mock tails, Beer in drinks. It was very nice.

I think I don't have to mention anything about Kebabs from Peter Cat as it is always good. We tried Chello Kebab there and Peter Cat is the only restaurant where I had Chello Kebab till now. I ask for it everywhere but I don't get it.

Everyone should visit there to try Chello Kebab and Sizzlers. It is really really heavenly.

Good Work Peter Cat. :-)

Peter Cat needs no eulogy to any food lover. For decades this legendary restaurant has been a favorite food destination. Frequented this place often in the childhood with family. The Chelo Kebab at Peter Cat is the stuff that legends are made of, albeit diminishing in quality since when I can recall from my younger days. However, it is not something to hold against them. The ambiance is still pleasant, the food still coveted and the waiters, still friendly. The Tandoori Mixed Grill and the Chicken Steak are equally good. Going over and over again is still not enough to satiate the glutton that accompanies when one thinks of Peter Cat. 

Although Chelo is certainly everyone's favorite ad is inadvertently seen to be amongst almost every order, most of the other dishes served here are equally appetizing. After countless visits, when you somewhat tire of the Chelo, make sure to try the other options. You won't be disappointing.

Heard, About  legendary Chelo kebab of Peter  Cat. 
But, never had  a chance to visit Peter Cat till today. The interior is welcoming and quite relaxing.
Good ambiance with friendly staff, I must say.
But , If you are not lucky enough...May be you have to wait outside to get seated.
When it comes to food,
The specialty of Peter -Cat  food is in the perfect blend of sweet and spicy flavors.
The staple food of people in Bengal is rice and fish, but I also had best kebabs in Kolkata.
I tried below preparations:-
1.Cream Of  Spring Chicken Soup-(Good)
2. Mutton Chelo kebab (Chelocious --My Favourite)
3. Chelo kebab(The Original)-(Awesome)
I luv the description of this mouth-watering preparation. Peter cat describes it as:-
‚ÄúThe protected regional product of west Bengal. Our Special Kebabs prepared in rare spices, blended  with Persian herbs and served on a bed of rice with butter and an egg.‚Äù
4. Souffl√© of the day-(Good)
Now,
I am in love with Bengali cuisine.
Peter Cat is a great place to dine-in with family and friends. Highly recommended. Would Luv to try here next time.

Amazing back in the day, Peter Cat is now just a average restaurant. Known for their Sizzlers and Chelo Kebabs, Peter Cat tries very hard to maintain their standards but is very unsuccessful. As the days go by their standard of food goes down. Not a must visit place, but an option if no other options are there.

Peter Cat is certainly one of the MOST well known destination of all foodies! Be it ambience or staff response, it scores a perfect 8 out of 10.
I have been there many times, and tried many things. But recently I tried GRILLED CHICKEN !! I must say, it was A_W_E_S_O_M_E !! I liked it very much. It was succulent, piquant and scrumptious.
Then I tried the desert, to name, WARM BROWNIE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM & HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE. It was simply mouth watering, luscious and appetizing. 
 Lastly a great place to dine in with your family and friends.
Looking forward for more visits.

On a chilly winter day, we arrived at Peter cat to savor the most-talked Chello-kebab. Ambiance is at par. But book your tables otherwise you have to wait long time on wekkend and on weekdays too. Promptly served with the menu we have ordered Prawn Cocktail, Mixed grill sizzlers, Chkn Chello kebabs. After few minutes appetizers and our cocktail came. They both tastes gr8, specially prawn. It is heaven.

  After tasting those two we concentrated on Chello Kebabs. How can I describe it. Yes, it is worth-praising, all types of kebabs on the plate with moist buttery rice and poached egg. You can taste heaven if you want. Some say the taste has been deteriorated along time, then I must say it is also worth having now.

  We are full, so we don't have ordered desserts here. Better luck next time.

Food has been excellent and outstanding in this Restaurant and Chello Kabab has been a pride of Kolkata, all thanks to Peter Cat for maintaining it for such a long time. The only concern is regarding the "STAFF". Being a Hotelier and working in this industry (ITC SONAR for 10 years and other 5 star properties) for such a long time I have understood that its the people/services that makes the difference, not the food. The Stewards and the Managers of this restaurant are lousy and having negative attitude towards their guests. when I said that the mutton seekh served in Chello Kabab seems to be tough and dry the Steward replied "yehi hai, aise hi banta hai" . For your kind information I am a Chef by Profession working as a senior Chef for 12 years in a 5 star hotel for many years so I knew that lamb is being overcooked. When I reported it to the Manager/Captain he was even ineffective and didn't even bother to offer me a fresh helping in-spite of me giving my introduction. Moreover while I was moving out the particular Steward was standing to get a TIP from me and also gave me a starred look when I didn't give that. Sad to say your staffs are a total waste, inhospitable, terrible and rotten for such a wonderful place.

Peter Cat is surely a LEGEND place for lunch or dinner in Park St. We were very interested in having the Chelo Kabba so we ordered it... ummm, the taste of it is lip smacking. I had it for the first time and I was in love! There is butter on the rice, makes the rice so delicious. And the Kababs! I love the chicken kabab a lot with the capsicum.

Peter Cat is certainly one of the pillars on the Kolkata food scene and a personal favorite. I am always so eager to dig into my meal that I invariably forget to take pictures of the food and most of you who read my reviews will know that I simply love to take photographs of my favorite dishes. Hopefully next time I will remember to do so. Red sofas and chairs , dim lighting , the enchanting whiff of sizzler smoke all add to the retro allure of Peter Cat. The long lines of diners waiting for a table every day and the 1500 plus votes it has got on Zomato not to mention that it features on over 800 favorite lists including mine is a testament to the reputation and food heritage of this legendary restaurant. 

The Chelo Kebab is its most famous dish available in Chicken/Mutton and Vegetarian Options is a hot seller and its rare if every table does not have atleast one Chelo Kebab sitting on it ! 

My other recomendations are listed below -
Starters - Prawn Cocktail, Fried Chicken Liver , Mutton Shammi Kebab and Fish Makhmali are all delicious.
Kebabs - Chicken Reshmi Kebab , Mutton Shikar Kebab  , Mutton Bara Kebab and Tandoori Prawn make my mouth water.
Indian Main Course - Paneer Butter Masala , Kabuli Channa , Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Mutton Nawabi are my hot picks paired with Rotis or the Biryani.
Sizzlers - House Special , Chicken Steak or Tandoori Mixed Grill will leave your taste buds smoking.
Dessert- Cream Caramel or Tutti Frutti for a happy ending.

They still serve a childhood favorite Cheese Pineapple and Cherry Sticks which I love and reminds me of my visits with my grandparents 30 years back !!!! I usually always prepare a parcel for the house as its humanly impossible to satiate all my cravings in one go :-P !!!! 
If you like to drink order up a beer which they serve in the old style metal tankards with a delicious chanachur (you only get this if you order an alcoholic beverage) or if your a cocktail person check out the hilariously illustrated cocktail menu and order yourself a Rum Collins , Peter Cat's Cooler or the Bloody Mary and wait to dine. 
This place sure makes your tummy feel like the Cat's Whiskers !!!

----- 07 Aug, 2012 -----

Dark, crowded and filled with delicious smells of all the sizzlers wafting around, this is one of my favourite places to dine on Park Street. Funnily enough though, I am not a Chelo Kebab fan. I love the Indian food, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Mutton Shikar Kebab, Chicken Bharta, Channa Masala and Paneer Butter Masala are excellent as is the Kali Dal and Mutton Nawabi. They make excellent Chicken Liver as a starter and good Shaami Kebabs as well and for desserts the Caramel Custard is an excellent option. 
Their sizzlers are fairly decent and portions are good but either go early or be prepared for a very long wait outside.

A big NO to all the veggies out here!!
After having wanting to try out this place for months yesterday I finally got a chance to get a seat here (have returned a couple of times earlier due to abysmally high waiting time).Just when we thought the toughest part was over and ordered some starters (Paneer tikka and Veg Burger) we were proven wrong.The toughest part was not to get in but get the food served on our table before our hunger died.After having waited for more than 35 minutes we finally got our order served on the table.Given that we all were really hungry and even an average quality food would have appetizing for us we were dismayed at the quality of food served-pathetic would be an understatement.The paneer tikka was under cooked and wasn't even remotely close to its original taste and the burger had a worse than road side aloo patty stuffed in between.French fries served along with the burger was stale and worsened our mood.We unanimously decided that we had enough bad food for the day and walked out and had way better food at a dhaba.

The Chelo Kabab house of Kolkata. The highlight of their menu is their Chelo Kabab. Every element on this place is just commendable. you would finish your portion and be forced to think if there is more place to accomodate another one of it. Its an old building and an old place, but has always made me food happy.

Almost a cult restaurant in Kolkata! If you go to Park Street for dinner, you have to be either in Peter Cat or in Barbeque (both from the same owners). Visited this place number of times, and never left disapponted. Chelo Kabab is their favourite dish. But if you want to experiment beyond Chelo Kabab, go for the Fish Finger, Grilled/Fried Fish. The tartar sauce they serve is very delicious. I usually stay away from there other mughlai dishes, you could find a better variety of them in other city restaurants.
Things which could be improved - The sitting area. The twin seater just in front of the main door should be removed. Its just in the middle of the street, and very uncomfortable during summers, when the main door is opened frequently. Also they could improve on the cutlery and the hand towel. I have found the towel torn and dirty a few times.
The best thing is it's still very affordable price wise.

The service is amazing and I don't know about others but gives me a feeling of old Calcutta....Though the place is a bit dark but once the smell of chelo kebabs reaches one's nose he can forget everything else.

visited this place had heard a lot about it from friends n relatives unfortunately i was with my gf who is a strict vegie so i had to order veg food. so i went for the mixed grilled veg sizzler and chilly babycorn as a starter. nw as soon as i took the first bite of the babycorn starter i was realy dissapointed, it was pathetic, even a road side eatery can make that dish lightyears ahead costed around 170 or 180  totaly wasted it went to the bin. next came the sizzler, nw dis was sumthng interesting whatever sizzler i have had in the past had rice noodles mixed vegies etc this one had assorted things lyk paneer tikka tanduri stufed alu stufd tomato and kind of veg chello kabbs etc with a little bit of indian gravy.Costed aprox 290 nd i liked it. Next tym when i cum il definately try the orignal chicken chello kaab as it seemed the most famous dish there.
Nw coming on the service, it was nice and warm
bt i was not very much amazed with the decor, dusty walls old cheapo tables atleast they should revamp the look of the resti
and the prices are slightly on the higher side

Peter Cat is a big loop of my life. Its one of those restaurants I say I don't like that much but then I keep going back to it! Treats, brunches, get togethers, Peter cat seems to be like the go-to place for every damn thing!

Anyway, coming back. Of all things, I love their Fruit cup! Its insanely weird but I enjoy it immensely! I also keep ordering the tandoori sizzler. I am really not a big fan of the Chelo kabab fraternity. It reminds me of the plate of  "maakhon-bhaat" mom would forcibly feed me before school. So its not the chelo kabab you see, its my childhood problem! Jokes apart, their slow cooked Leg of lamb is also great with roti.

P.s. I don't know what, but there's something about their lights that gives us great pictures every time!

I'm a great fan of Peter Cat restaurant at the heart of Kolkata for a long time.....since I tasted the delicious chelo kebab for the first time. Its a very heavy food, full of calories & cholesterol, but absolutely mouthwatering. And also the sizzlers and Prawn cocktail are just awesome. Combine them with the variety of cocktails available at your disposal at a very reasonable price, you get a fine dining experience with your loved ones....... But keep this in mind, Kolkatans love this place. So be early on special days or you have to wait in a very very long queue outside. 
The environment inside is very cozy, albeit a little dark. The tables are lighted by a fancy bulb hanging at the center of the table. And the waiters greet you in traditional moghlai dresses. But in time what I feel that the waiters behavior have deteriorated. And the mismanagement of the queue standing outside the gate should be avoided....

went to this place with my wife for some fyn dining for the first time in kolkata after i returned back,,, heard a lot from every frend of mine about this place. i have developed quite a fondness for continental stuff in recent times and had hard luck in hyderabad to find out the right place.. so after having some starter i  ordered  a mixed grill for myself   and chicken sizzler for my wife..
we were given a 2 seater table which was half slanting and i was almost in a semi hanging position,,,,,,,,,after some persistent requests we were allotted a separate table. at the end i can only say its pocket friendly, but over hyped.
ambiance- suffocating / noisy
food- 3/5 , the sizzler was not that great that i would love to visit again
the sauce with the mixed grill was just awesomely bad.
any way once a while just for  namesake if you visit parkstreet you can try this restaurant out once.

What to comment on one of the legends of Park Street. I went their with my girlfriend one fine afternoon. The ambience of the restaurant is excellent. Staff is well trained abd very helpful.
Most wonderful thing was the menu, so cutely displayed within a cat face.
The variety of cocktails and the variance in their speciality, Sizzlers, will make you spellbound. Choose from any of the many available, and you won't be disappointed. Service is also very good.
Only con I found was the size of the table for two. Its too small to fit two glasses, two plates and the dishes you ordered, that you have to compromise a bit.
Otherwise, I am really impressed. Peter Cat, I will be visiting you very soon again.

Whenever you visit this area, it is so natural that you step in to Peter Cat to have your stomach refueled. With good pedigree in continental dishes, this restaurant will not disappoint you in any way. We went there on a weekday afternoon but the whole restaurant was still brimming with people and we had difficulty finding seats for only 2 of us. But it was more that made up for when we were served the all time favourite Chelo Kabab. And we also tried the Tandoori mixed grill from the sizzler category. Both these items were wonderful for the palate. The service was also good and did not disappoint us. So in all, I would like to rank it in the very good category.

Whenever you visit this area, it is so natural that you step in to Peter Cat to have your stomach refueled. With good pedigree in continental dishes, this restaurant will not disappoint you in any way. We went there on a weekday afternoon but the whole restaurant was still brimming with people and we had difficulty finding seats for only 2 of us. But it was more that made up for when we were served the all time favourite Chelo Kabab. And we also tried the Tandoori mixed grill from the sizzler category. Both these items were wonderful for the palate. The service was also good and did not disappoint us. So in all, I would like to rank it in the very good category.

I have visited here for the first time and hence understand why people get mad in the name of peter cat!!! though I have to wait more than half an hour in the queue, but soon i realized, its quite justified in a Saturday afternoon.

ambiance was nice & comfy. I went there with my close colleges and ordered drinks at first.
we took petercat's special chicken kebab as appetizer. served hot!!! delicious and spicy enough. then we ordered the legendary chelo kebab. Chelo kabab- an indescribable dish, when you are having it just went too mouthful to utter a voice until the dish is finished!!! 
though the rate is in higher side, one must try this once. At least it will worth the money.

A place which really lives upto its name and legacy...the food is very much flavorsome. The ambience is very well set by the lights. The service is quite appreciable. The only thing which is a not really a concern but disturbed me was their restricted foot space and walking space...ie a lil congested. The food n service - a big thumbs up!

Now this is the place born and brought up in kolkata's legacy....It's just as much a place to visit as any other heritage site...and is definitely my favourite...

although this place will always have a queue....but i don't think anyone ever complained!!....Inside....the whole get-up has an old era-charm...always bustling and joyful....

To me, Peter Cat is synonymous with the Chelo-Kebab....that beautiful plateful of soft rice..with a lava of molten butter flowing...beautifully adorned with flavourful and succulent kebabs...and garnished with roasted veggies...ultimately crowned with a sunny fried egg....it is truly a royal dish...although other places nearby serve it...but this place is THE original...

Among the rest...the indianised Sizzlers are really worth trying....one could also opt for the Mughlai options...
They offer a really good range of cocktails and other drinks to wash everything down with...

There are very few places that can match up to the exuberance of Peter Cat....and this is one place that will always have a place in every Calcuttan's heart!!

Some things never change. A mother's love, Calcutta 's warmth, peter cat's food. Epic! The sizzlers are to die for and I could kill for the prawn cocktail and bloody Mary. Mom tells me that my first proper grown up meal was at this restaurant at the age of 2. Peter cat is an essential part of life :-)

Excellent. In terms of Food Quality, Price and Customer Care. The most popular in Park Street and surely in Kolkata. Sizzlers are great. And of course Chelo Kabab. I had their Chelo 20 years back and had it even a few days back. It's the same - Awesome. The Indian food quality is also very good. The experience will be even greater if they can think out-of-the-box and take some care of the huge number of hungry people waiting outside their entrance.

I think everyone knows of Peter Cat since its been such a heritage restaurant in Kolkata. One can make out what an amazing place it must be by looking at the long queues outside its gates during lunch and dinner. the wait is worth it when it comes to the tummy satisfying food. I love the dum ki raan , chelo kebabs and the fish steak sizzlers there. they're out of the world! You MUST try the chelo and the sizzlers, its a MUST if you go there.

This one lists among the first few restuarants I dined in Kolkata , having heard the legacy of Peter Cat I was a little worried  if we could manage to get a place,thankfully we dint have to wait too long and managed to get a place on the ground floor although I'd wanted to seat at the top.

The ambience was quite compared to the busy road it was located in, lighting was just right. Settling down a bit browsed through the menu and the liquor menu card did catch my attention with their comicy pictures.

Me being a vegetarian ordered Vegetable chelo Kebab and poca cosa(sunset), I must say I have never had a whole meal as tasty and satisfying as this was, paneer barbeques rightly cooked and flavored, the nicely flavored rice with butter, the sheik kebabs were a delight, it was perfect.The Cocktail Poca cosa dint sink in that well, the ingrediants din seem to sink in well, but i guess there a lot more to try from the liquor menu.

The service was a little laid back, which need to improve

On a whole my taste buds were rewarded and will surely visit this place for the Chelo kebabs.

We had tried for dinner at PETER CAT after getting reviews and experience was just opposite...

Sizzlers.....their speciality...Steak sizzlers...not good in taste...just the taste is like manchurian but not so good at all.

Also they served with cucumber which was bitter in taste and over price...Rs. 300/-+ vat....

Another one famous chelo kabab....the kabab is not so much tasty ...it is much more better available in Arsalan, Afza and just like this retora.. only the environment was good..

We did not like the taste of their preparation....Sorry....

Why going to this restaurant?

1.  Outstanding ambience
2.  Outstanding cooking 
    2.1    Outstanding vareity (quality of food prepared by  the chef)
3.  Outstanding location (where it is situated. after having packed with its scrumptous food, if one craves for sweet tooth go to flury's and many more)
4.  Outstanding service
5.  Outstanding affordability

A true legend and a restaurant to introduce the concept of Raan in Kolkata.

Also the First tp introduce Chicken Bharta in Kolkata.

The First restaurant to introduce Chicken Steak.

And the first resaturant to introduce SIZZLERS

Also the first restaurant to to introduce Persian Pulao.....

A true masterpeice signatory Chello Kebab, and the first restaurant to introduce this dish in Kolkata and the concept of serving kebab with pilaf.

Hot Chocolate is really scrumptous.....

If above reasons does not explain why one should go to this five star restaurant,  then there are no other reasons in this world

This place use to be my favorite Sizzler joint before the newer establishment came to the scene with innovative recipe's and better dishes, But if you want to try the old world sizzler this is the place for you. 
Same goes with there signature dish Chello Kabab. It was unique and awesome a few years back, now one can get better dishes elsewhere.

I still end up going to the place , waiting for 45 minutes for my reservation to come up and trying the same old dishes as a walk down memory lane has its own charm.

Have heard about Peter cat from my friends and beyond a lot. So naturally the expectations have been bloating a lot. 

We went there on a busy year end lunch. There was a big crowd, but still we were able to walk in immediately as we were ok with having a table for 2 even with a kid. We were clear to order only the signature dishes and hence did not fiddle much. A soup followed by Chelo kebabs and chicken sizzlers. The waiter suggested to go with additional bread roles and we obliged. 

The food arrived in style. I saw impressed with the sizzler with tender cooked chicken and veg. But could not stop comparing them with the wholesome ones we used to find in noodle bar, Hyderabad. Quantity was less than expected. The grilled kebabs were good but I was not impressed with the fried ones. 

Surprisingly the overall price was also ok. I would certainly want to try some other non signature dishes if I get another chance.

Now, this comes late, but can never be missed. Peter Cat, a legacy in itself. A strongly recommended  restaurant for any visitor, tourist or for that matter anyone who  steps in Kolkata.

To start with, Prawn Cocktail, a dish which was a definitive innovation in itself; and my personal excitement to be there. It just doesn't leave your palate for a long time. fried chicken liver, which is a another major attraction as a starter. And at any visit, I don't remember to miss them.

And then, something which this place has bred on...Sizzlers... Grilled Fish Sizzlers and Chicken Steak Sizzlers, my all time preference... They are wholesome, tasty and too good to be missed.... The food here has always maintained its standards...

A special mention... Zam Zam, in the beginning I tried it for the crazy name it had.. and then it turns out to be my favourite...

The service here at times, has disappointed the the customers. And there has been an issue of space and reservations on special days. But we can give all this a miss to eat the delicious food.

So, if you are in Kolkata, you better not miss Peter Cat.

Good ambience, great food, good heritage but a very very long queue. These are the characteristics that describe Peter Cat. I have always enjoyed eating here but the queue makes you woner if the food is worth the wait. Well, I assure you that it is. People will always suggest that you go to Peter Cat and enjoy the Chello Kebab. Yes it is a favourite there but what I really like in Peter Cat is the Mexican Grilled Chicken Sizzler with its jiucy soft chicken pieces filled with a spicy mexican aroma. I also enjoy the chicken stake sizzler which is sure to give you a lovely feeling inside. 

I recommend that you visit Peter Cat, which is one of Park Street's most famous restaurant!

My all time favorite sizzlers' place at Kolkata. Very nice ambience and located right at the food hub of Kolkata - Park street.
The chello-kebabs are also a must try, but I must say the chello is not the authentic one that one would expect in a Persian cuisine..
A little expensive though but worth the money.

Peter Cat is one of the older restaurants of Park Street and needs no introduction.

Pluses: Chello Kebabs (I prefer the chicken version over the mutton version though). Try Shikaar - that was brilliant piece of mutton kebabs
Minuses: Cramped and congested, long queues whenever you land up, musty smell, lights are too dim. It sure needs an overhaul/renovation.

Its been time since i have lost count on how many times i have actually visited this place. At any instant the restaurant u relate with park street is peter cat. whether with friends or family its always THE ultimate place you can visit without a second thought.

There was a time when i used to enter the place and straight over ordered chelo kebab without even going through the menu card and am sure many do the same but i would like to put forward my suggestion of trying out there sizzlers too. The grilled fish sizzler is aweesome and the grilled chicken sizzler stands after the fish one but chelo kebab will always be on top of the list (Can't help i am very weak when it comes to chelo kebab :P) The cream of chicken asparagus soup is just mouth-watery creamy. That is my favorite in the soups range. Chicken biryani is just below average so better not ordered.

To cut short Kolkata's finest restaurant Peter Cat and its delicious offering chelo kebab can drive any foodie crazy.

What i would like the management to take care of is, recently i had visited the place and  it was very heart breaking to see the waiters hanging around the table at the time of bill payment for tips. It doesn't suit the class of the restaurant besides they should be aware that service charge amount is added to the bill so there's no point being so demanding for tips.

Had waited  long  to  taste  the food  here...  The  sizzlers  and  chelow  kebabs  from  Peter   Cat  are  well  known  across  Kolkata...  So  finally   went  to  the  place  with   my   friends.  As  we  had  went  on  a  Saturday  ,    we  had  to  wait  a  little  to  get   seats  . However  before  long  we  were   seated  comfortable  in  a  four seating table...   we  ordered  chelow   kebabs  ,  fresh juice  and  biriyani....The  biriyani  was  tasty  though  nothing  exceptional and    the   quantity  was  good.   The  chelow  kebab  was  quite  nice  too...  The  Chicken  kebabs   in  the  plate  was  heavenly...  overall  a nice  experience...  would  like  to  taste  the  sizzler  sometime  soon!

OVER-RATED, OVER-RATED & OVER-RATED!!!! that is the only word that describes peter cat!!! i had very high expectations from this restaurant but it disappointed me on all fronts!!! 
firstly, ambience, is nice if you like to keep quiet and eat, i found it really morose in terms of ambience if you are a person who likes to enjoy a meal through a nice conversation or maybe a good laugh this is not the place for you, people give looks which can be reflected as being offended when you laugh or clink your spoon maybe accidentally.....
service is low, and not so hospitable as you would expect it to be.
Food is horrible, I'm sorry to use the word, but that's the truth, there is absolutely no flavour in the food, it tastes bland, the naan got stiff very soon and then one had to struggle with it!!!! the only thing that I liked was the virgin mary that they served. Over all I might sound harsh but Peter Cat does not live up to its name!!!!

Heard much hype about this restaurant and went in with great expectations. Food arrived after 50 minutes. Starters were below average and extremely spicy. The main course was really poor. Butter nans were unusually thick (1 inch or more :( and in places undercooked). Really put off considering the initial waiting period and the pricing.

Peter Cat was a common name on the list of all foodies that I have had the privilege of interacting with. And so, I along with my friends decided to pay a visit. It was a weekday afternoon and we, a group of 9, had to wait for quite a few minutes to get a table. But the wait was totally worth it.
The ambiance is captivating. The seating is extremely pleasant and the lighting just perfect.
The service is good. We were greeted warmly by the staff. As majority of us were vegetarians, there was a confusion regarding the order, but the staff helped us out on this one.
From what I had at Peter Cat, Chello Kabab is definitely its best bet. No wonder Peter Cat has become synonymous for Chello Kabab. The non-veg mixed grill sizzler too was nice, although I personally would have liked it a bit more spicy. The chicken biriyani which they serve is decent. 
Mutton roganjosh was good too, though definitely not the best I have had.

Overall the Peter Cat experience has great. I am looking forward to pay a second visit soon. :)

Park Street, Peter Cat , Chelo kebab. 

hard to separate from each other. separating any one of the above components would be a sin similar to removing any component of the chelo. right from the melting butter cube on steaming rice to the perfectly cooked meat kebabs its a experience that must be savored by all calcuttans.

though chelo steals the show, not mentioning the sizzlers would be doing grave injustice. sizzlers are a real delight with delicious grilled meat. for starter, would recommend prawn cocktail.

all the main course dishes are adequate for one person and total paisa wasool. plus the place has a fine dining experience. perfect for an awesome meal with family.

P.S. - keep 15-20 minute in hand for standing in queue if visiting on weekends

The legacy of Peter Cat continues and it occupies a major place in Kolkata's rich heritage. Peter Cat, located at Park Street is one of the legends of this beautiful city. This place is always crowded on weekends and special occasions, so it is better to visit on a weekday, otherwise plan to wait outside for more than an hour. Now, coming to the most important part, food quality of Peter Cat is excellent, specially the kebabs. We ordered Afghani Chicken, it was very tasty. Like everyone does, we also ordered the famous Chelo Kebab and it was really impressive. Not just the kebab, but the rice with butter and egg also smelled good. Appetising indeed ! 

Chelo Kebab overshadows all other items on the menu, but each item on the menu stands out tall. The ambience is great and the service is good (but the waiters always demand for more tips). I have heard many people say that the standards of Peter Cat has gone down, but still it has a lot to offer.  

All these makes Peter Cat a must-go. If you are in the city for the first time and you want to try out some restaurants, then Peter Cat should be one of them. 

Food quality and taste: 4.5/5
Food presentation: 4.5/5

Food is great here. It is mostly famous for Chello kababs and sizzlers. The place gives you a feel of Arab, the waiters are dressed in arabic style's. The place is quite big. Bar is also available.An interesting thing is that though there are many waiters here but then also service is not that great.Its always busy if you are late you might just have to wait outside. Though the price is on the higher side but it makes up as the food they offer is great. Its one of the oldest restaurant's in Park Street. Peter Cat gives Park Street another view point altogether. Must Visit.

Every time I come back to Kolkata I always make it a point to come at least once for some Dansburg beer along with Chelo Kebab or a Sizzler.
Went there for dinner.As usual there was a huge crowd waiting to get in,almost resembling a mob. Luckily it was only two of us and we managed to score a seat in 10 minutes.
Anyways on this visit found out they no longer serve Dansburg which was a huge disappointment. Started with the fish Makhmali, Mutton bara and chicken tikka . Still nice,not the best I've had but almost feels like comfort food. Standout was the fish makhmali.

Had the Tandoori Mixed grill sizzler as the main course. Good as usual but found that they put a wee bit too much of gravy on it,not a deal killer though.

Glad to see that Peter Cat still maintains its tradition,not much has changed (which is a good thing). Just wish they would add Dansburg back on the menu.

I would normally rate it 3.5, the extra half star is because of nostalgia and memories attached to it

Food: 7.5/10
Service: 6/10
Ambience and Decor: 7/10

I visited Peter Cat twice and both the times I had to wait for an hour or so to get a table for two! This is probably one of the turn-offs of this restaurant but when the food arrives on your table and when you take the first bite from it, you forget everything! Chelo Kebab, which is the speciality of this place, is indeed an awesome platter! The kebabs on it are always very tender and juicy. I love the sizzlers as well. For me, more than Chelo Kebab, the sizzlers of Peter Cat gets more points in terms of taste as well as the presentation. I love to take cocktails with my meals and the Screw Driver is the best one for me here! The starters are great as well. Fish and chips is another delicacy which you might get elsewhere but it won't taste as good as Peter Cat's! Apart from the fact that the place is generally too crowded and the waiters are a bit arrogant, Peter Cat is a must visit for one and all in Kolkata and also for the ones who visit Kolkata occasionally! For me, this place is 4 out of 5 !

yet another food preference in park street.... had been to this place over the years.... located beside music world.. if you are not lucky enough may be you have to wait outside to get seated even not during the prime hours.... "chello kebabs" tops the must try list.... its sumptuous and mouth watering..... billing will be good enough if you want to fill up your stomach.... otherwise for a treat to the tastebuds its just fine and fits the bill.... ;)

I visited this place yesterday and I never had such bad experience in my whole life.The place was too ordinary.Even I heard one customer saying that they shuld change the display of the bottles in the bar section.

Service: Orderd wine and moctail at first and the man asked for our Ids to make sure we are not teengers.My friend manage to provide one but I don't carry my Id all the time specially on sundays.Then the man told my friend that he can't share his drink with me and there were cameras and they are watching us.(Seriously???) And we waited for more or less 30mins to get the food.

Food: Orderd Fish and chips, Chelo kabab,Biriyani.Why people love chelo??For me it was too spicy and nothing to remember,the rice served with chelo tastes better.Fish and chips was good so the biriyani.

Music: While we were waiting for food only thing heard was a goat and a baby crying.(can you imagine??)

THANKS FOR SPOILING MY SUNDAY......

A favourite in the city, and only 1 word for the place - chelo. Perfectly mastered to attract crowds with good food quality and a reasonable price for one of the oldest restaurants in the city. They do have separate sections for family and the primary reason is as you walk in, it gives you a feel of a medieval mafia bar setting. But it's a definite go go! I love the place for its food!

The  Chelo Kebabs took me to Peter Cat and while coming out of the front-door of this restaurant clinging to its age-old history of wooing Kolkatan foodies with their drool-worthy platters, the chelo was one of the lingering thoughts that were uppermost on my mind. I am not planning to talk much about the signature dish of this better known part of Park Street and will be rather happy to share a few more love affairs that I had on a Saturday night at this eatery. 

Let me offer enough adulation to the very elegant looking Amazonia (Vodka+pineapple juice). That was the perfect beginning of  the evening after a tedious wait of an hour, outside the restaurant. The red wine that followed with an impeccably elegant looking Fish Makhmali Kebabs ( that literally melts in your mouth) made my evening. The Chicken Hyderabadi Kebab would have received better grades from me only if it would have not been on the same table with the Fish Makhmali Kebabs. Honestly speaking, a salute to the Maitre d, who suggested this dish that can single-handedly woo a group of foodies back from many other lip smacking suitors. 

The Roasted chicken sizzler made its presence felt ( not only with its sizzling sound and the power to set the fire alarm ringing) in its own right. Even the toasted potatoes on the platter and the special poached egg ( I never had such a wonderful poach before) on the Chelo platter played the cupids in my love affair with Peter Cat on last Saturday night ( 07.12.13). If the Amazonia started it all off with the right mood. Chelo made it come a full circle to make me fall in love with this place.

The best part of any dish was probably ( rather obviously) the tenderness of all protein assortments in the dishes we ordered ( fish, chicken, mutton). I will go back to this place and this time, will get less irritated to wait for an hour to receive my first drink of the night.

Been there a month ago on my friends birthday... This comes under the list of oldest restaurants in kolkata..
Average on pocket but good enough for sizzlers along with a pint of beer.
There menu comes with a huge variety of cocktails and tastes good..
Will give one more attempt to it for well known chelos kabaab..

The Chelo Kebab was the only reason why visiting Peter Cat was necessary. I'm definitely not the first one (and hell, I obviously won't be the last) who's gonna get clean-bowled with the Magnum Opus of this restaurant. I did hear how good the dish is, but it's also true that I often wondered, "Is this praise really worth it? It's a dish with rice, butter, poached egg and 2 types of kebabs, after all."

Sunday nights are pretty hassle-prone if you are going for a Park Street dinner. But I never imagined it was gonna be something so mind-boggling with Peter Cat! I guess I was extremely lucky to get a seat with just 45 minutes of waiting outside. Ordered one Chelo Kebab & one Griller Chicken Sizzler along with a Screwdriver and a Budweiser. The Sizzler was fantastic; 2 huge pieces of chicken breasts cooked to perfection. However, it got completely overshadowed when I sank my teeth into the real deal - the Chelo. The thing which caught me off-guard was not the kebabs but the rice. It has this strange aroma that gets complimented so well with the butter dollop. Even if the kebabs (which were equally stupendous) were not there, I could have gobbled on just the rice itself. Take a bow, Peter Cat! It was amazing!

Mind you, the range of cocktails available here is pretty huge and they are cheaper than most high-end restaurants. If you are into having a glass with the main course, Peter Cat is definitely a place to opt for.

Overall, the experience was pretty good. Just be a little early to reach this restaurant, as its popularity might make you wait a long time. Absence of seating arrangements for the people waiting outside, and a little lack of knowledge coming from the attendant (who couldn't explain the difference between Grilled Chicken and Roast Chicken) were a let-down. But the food was awesome... and it more or less, covered the loopholes well.

A place which was a extreme favorite of mine has slowly disintegrated with time. I took my father on his birthday and my experience was dissapointing to say the least. As soon we entered we were pushed to the non family section with an excuse that there were no female members. When I politely mentioned that a father and son constitutes a family it did not make any difference. I didnt want to make matters worse and went to the section mentioned. The food was worse - chicken irani kabab looked like reshmi kabab with a different name, chelo kabab no longer is the best in kolkata and fish fingers were really average. The height of the evening was a small bowl of oil soaked french fries at 100 rupees. In between the waiters managed to switch our drink orders but I found it before it was too late ;)

 Request from an earnest lover of Peter Cat -improve your standards to match your legacy. Want to come again for a better experience. Also to waiters - please stop hanging over the customers head for tips. Looks very awkward at such a classy place.

The menu is a classic in Peter Cat and has managed to hold onto the same taste as it was 20 years now! If you dig around though, you'll discover its the namesake of a famous cat who lived in Lords cricket ground in London from 1952 to 1964 (and Kolkata is a city addicted to cricket). What has changed and for the better is the service with waiters ever attentive. Fish Muniar & Chelo Kebab were mouthwatering.. the caramel custard was good too...! the food is an appealing mix of Indian and continental, and the environment quirky and unique. I ordered the chicken sizzler (chicken breast, vegetables, egg, and sauce), chelo kebab and both were cooked to perfection. but very few know that this is a persian restaurant with the vintage dressed waiter serving you. one should taste Biriyani nayantara, chicken lababdar kulcha and its kababs. they have a very good selection of drinks and sweet dishes. three cheers......... Peter cat rocks

A true legend on Park Street. Peter Cat indeed goes synonymous with heritage of Kolkata. Chello Kebab and Sizzlers are an all-time hit here. If you order beer here, you will be in for a surprise- they serve in brass-copper mugs! That too quiet adds to your feel-good experience. Try to visit the restaurant on a weekday, else be prepared for an hour long wait! Many options in the menu as well.

when a nice place starts diluting service standards-the sound bites get mighty high.We ordered chelo kebabs,chicken marakesh and beer-and were mighty dissapointed.

The seekh kabab in the chelo was cold,along with the reshmi kabab.To add to the sorrow-it was stringy also.

The marakesh chicken was overcooked-and looked straight out for a microwave.

The beer was good

Service was insolent.

The owners should be listening.......

its my all time favourite. I have been visiting this place from childhood. I have shared all phases of my life here. On birthady it was a mandate for my Dad to get me to Peter Cat just to sizzle with the special sizzler at Peter Cat. On parting my ways with school, this place use to give me immense pleasure to reunite with all my friends once again. Post your Degree its was my first Job and First salary to treat my friends and loved ones at Peter Cat. I dated my Husband at Peter Cat. So one can understand how much i like the resturant. Though its always crowded and you have to wat a little long hrs to get the place. But this things really doesnt bother when its PETER CAT. I love it and will keep loving it.

Peter Cat was in the wish list since I have planned to visit Kolkata. This is located in a perfect place in Kolkata, where Xaviers is a neighbour. The place has got  a great ambience and the food equally balance the awesomeness. The menu is really good in terms of continental dishes. This is a must visit place if you are anywhere in the city of Kolkata. 

Highly recommended.

The first time though I had to wait for about 1 hour, but the food was worth the wait. Liked the ambiance. The service was good. Though Chello Kebab is the signature dish, every time I go there, I end up opting for sizzler which is amazing.

Would recommend this to anyone who is a foodie like me :)

Be prepared to wait for a table on Fridays and weekends and sometimes even on weekdays. This place is old school and really crammed up for space but it is good. The service is not that great but some of the old waiters are really nice and warm. One thing that is certain here is good food. Always. The fried chicken livers is an item that is polished off really soon. Their claims to fame is of course the chelo kebab and the sizzlers and rightfully so. I am a small eater and hence always struggle to finish these things alone. I need at least one more person to share the same with me. Also impressive are the chicken butter masala and reshmi butter masala. The naans and parathas are decent and served in old wicker baskets covered with a cloth napkin. There is really very little to not like about this legendary place. The only complain that one might hear from time to time about places like Mocambo and Peter Cat is that their staff is a bit high handed and arrogant. That is probably because of the reputation they have developed with regards to the food they serve. Each and every time that I go here I come back satisfied and with the feeling of having bitten off more than I can chew.

Dining is an experience and food is the epicentre of it. However this is not the only criteria. While Peter Cats Chelo Kabas are what the stuffs of legend are all about, they are the only thing that pulls me inside this otherwise very dilapidated and borderline depressing place. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired of and the broken sofas can definitely do with a makeover, however the ultimate turnoff is the horrid service and the downright rude staff. And what is most putting off is the marked difference in the staffs attitude towards any foreigners and us mere mortals who reside in Kolkata! I hope they do something about it soon else the food may not prove to be enough.

Peter Cat, the one restaurant I have visited over different phases of life, from being a kid, teenager, adolescent adult to an adult, only to have the memories become sweeter and pleasant every time. I don't remember returning from Peter Cat ever without a smile on my face, tongue and tummy. 

Ambience - The smell, I love the smell of Peter Cat, it is almost like associating with one's bloodline. It is amazing how the smell has remained absolutely the way it used to be even over ten years back. They have extended the smoking zone for a long time now, and something that hasn't bothered me and thus I haven't ever taken a note of. Yes, the smoking zone seating is cramped and all that, and am sure a bit of rearrangement could do it a miracle. Otherwise, both the ground and first floor provide an extremely pleasant seating. Funny thing, I have sat as a couple, a group of three/four, in big groups, and thus occupied almost all the tables laid out in Peter Cat, and thus have particular fond memories associated with each seat. :)

Service - If you ask me about the long wait in line every time of the year, 24*7, 365 days, it is awful. But again even the wait has become stereotypical Peter Cat where everyone keeps an hour in hand or so to have their chat/coffee/ice cream sessions while waiting for their turn. I do atleast and gladly so. The staff is extremely polite, always smiling and welcoming. Even the doorman. I can almost remember him aging through the years, standing steady to slouchy now. But he has always been there with a smile to welcome one to the hungry haven of Peter Cat.

Cocktails - I had the first cocktails of my life ever at Peter Cat and thus came to know about Gin, Vodka, Whisky, Rum, etc. My favourite was and still remains their rum collins. The smell of the syrup and lemon itself here gives me a high. Peter Cat always served pocket friendly cocktails and the trend continues even now. The chanachur served by them holds no competition. Have it with the onion in vinegar and the tongue is on a roll! 

Food - My favourites at Peter Cat comprise a list, chelo kebab, beckty muniere, fish and chips, grilled fish, mixed grill, chicken steak and liver curry. I have never gone out of these items to check the rest of the menu. It is almost a matter of sanctity - Peter Cat sizzler! The waiter will first place the orange or pink paper on the table and within minutes the sizzling dish will be infront of you, making you burn your tongue for a good whole two days. :) I have had sizzlers in Peter Cat when there weren't flourishing restaurants in and around town, and never have I felt that the dish has been compromised. It is almost like maintaining and promoting the loyalty of a brand.

Peter Cat, I will visit you with my grand children, great grand children. Hold your head high, you DESERVE it!

Chelo Kebabs are the specialty here. That's the one one dish which brings me back to this restaurant again and again. I felt the waiters are a bit old fashioned and   expect to be tipped well irrespective of the the service. I didn't like the sizzlers (although I have tasted them only once).  Apart from the chelo , Birayani ala nawabi is also pretty nice. Afghani chicken is also good.

Good food, brilliant ambiance, decent service
There would be very few people who have stayed in Kolkata for a substantial time period and not have known of Peter Cat. A kind of royalty, this place is teeming with guests during weekends; so much so that there are hour long waiting queues just to get in. We were on a visit on Sunday night for dinner, and as luck would have had it a 40 min wait. But that didn't deter us and we waited.
Once in, the ambiance definitely impresses you. A total fine dining look and lots of small tables. We ordered chelo kebab (which is a specialty there), biriyani and a chicken side dish. The biriyani was decent but the kebabs were amazing. While they could have improved on the service (which was a bit lack lustre) but I would give the benefit since the traffic of guests was just too much. A place for visiting frequently of course.

This place really is a legend! The history of Kolkata, the tradition and the very heritage has Petercat entwined along with it !

Such is the aura of this place , that this can feature as a well entrenched tourist spot in the map of the city!

There is very little to choose from the menu if you're a first timer here for what you just need to order is Chello Kebab!

This is the speciality here and an absolute delight!

I have been going to Petercat since the 90s and would like to do some till I am 90 !

Zomato is the site i use the most, when ever i come back home because a huge part of my trips home is food. I do not like going to places i have been before because there are so many new places i need to go to every time i come back home.
Peter Cat is one of the few places i just have to exempt from my rule.

It is a heritage restaurant which is still without doubt the best the city has to offer. Be it the huge wait you mostly need to face to get into the restaurant to the dark and cool feel of it interiors and most of all the, oh so delicious Tandoori Chicken I dream about so often when I am in Bangalore, its all part of Peter Cat's unique and delicious experience.

Your experience starts from the doorman who is like the Secretary of The President. He gets to choose who goes in based on the no of people waiting at the tables available. Then, after entering the lamps over the circular tables always make me feel like a gangster having his daily grub. The smartly dressed and etiquette waiters add to the appeal of this magnificent restaurant .

Although everything on the menu is good the stand out dishes are - 

Tandoori Chicken - I have had tandoori chicken all over India but nothing beats Peter Cat. It is the juiciest tastiest chicken i have ever had with the the best marinate which is tangy and spicy and just percolates to the center of the   chicken. Just writing about it makes me drool.

Chelo Kabab - This is the kebab meal you should go for. The egg is perfect, the roasted tomato to die for and the Kebabs when all buttered up the closest you can get to perfection. Eat the kebabs with the egg for best taste. I always reserve the tomato for last because it always leaves a pleasant after taste.

This is the best restaurant in Kolkata and what makes it even better is that you get alcohol there. 

Overall - The place to go to enjoy beautiful Chicken and Kebabs along with a few cocktails and beers

#1 Restaurant in Kolkata for sure.

I think one can tell for the innumerable number if reviews and the legendary Chelo Kebab that this place is an exceptionally eating place. I was informed of this restaurant my my grandparents and how they have seen this restaurant since their childhood, loving every time they go. Hearing all the praise, I was naturally quite excited to go. 
Unfortunately, once we had arrived, we had to wait around 40 minutes to get a seat, I assume this isn't usually a problem . But just don't go during rush time or you will have to wait in the heat. 
The ambiance of the place hit me at once- and I loved it. The cozy, private atmosphere that is presented through the low dim lights sets up the scene for an enchanting Arabian night. 
However, the night again hit a bump on the road. I had ordered a prawn cocktail and found myself cringing every time I took a bit. It was much too sweet and didn't not have as much tomato as previous prawn cocktails that I have had. Also, one thing I love about shrimp cocktails is the fresh crunch of fennel, coriander, and cucumbers which was void in this dish. 
In very reasonable time., the famous Chelo Kebab was placed at our tables. I was very impressed with the colorful and elegant presentation of the dish and enchanted by the smell. Both kebabs  were were marinated and tender. It went well with the rich butter rice and the fresh cucumber and tomato. The eggs was also nice and I love how it is layer on the bed of rice. However one thing I would like to mention is not to go to Peters Cat thinking that you will had the most extraordinary dish in your life. Thou the meal was good- and I mean really good- it definitely didn't meet my super high expectation. Now this is no fault of the restaurant, but please be mindful not to go with supper high expectations, because they will not be met.

very true to its tradition which dates back to the college days of our parents,this place is famous for the chelo kabab and sizzlers. the awesome aroma and the sizzling sound of the wonderfully tasty sizzlers and the dimly lit decor with the traditional khansama like attire of the waiters add to the taste of the food. even the menu cards are interesting with the cat face on them and the quirky cartoons on the liquor menu. a wonderful place to have a lavish meal as well as a hangout. ideal for a reunion of best friends.

One of the famous restaurants in Park Street. Famous for its chelo kebabs and sizzlers. Getting a table of weekends and holidays is the major challenge. If you can overcome the same then its a trip down the retro years.
In starters we had Fried Beckty, Fish finger and Fish Makhmali Kabab with chilled beer served in metal mugs.¬†
Main course is incomplete without Chelo Kabab and Chicken Sizzler. Ended with chocolate brownie in vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.
Service is slow due the amount of footfall in the restaurant. Such heritage eatery can be maintained in much better way to revive the legacy. The starters can be served in some better plates or bowls instead of dented steel bowls.¬†Price may be heavier for your pockets.

This place is historical ! One of the oldest in Kolkata and is a must visit to know its people,heritage and food ! Try their innovative and out of the world Chelo Kebab ! Its so damn good that you would think of any other options,each and everytime you visit this place. But the one thing I hate about it is, the que that alwaz remains out of this place is utterly disgusting ! Be it a anyday or any time of the meal, u have to wait for getting seats ! :(

This place is a legend. The restaurant is located in Park Street and is one of the most famous restaurants in the city. Over the years, every Calcuttan with an inclination towards good food has atleast visited this place once if not more. I went there with my friend (Dipak), I think this is my 50th visit to this place or may be more. The atmosphere inside is just awesome with soft dim lights, the cat shaped menu card and smells of kebabs & sizzlers all around to make your tongue tickling. We straight order their signature dish 'Chelo Kebab'. The 'Chelo Kebab' of Peter Cat is still consistently good after all these years and a favourite for most regulars in this joint. If you are a regular customer, you know what I‚Äôm talking about, but if you are a newcomer do try the Chelo Kebab (An absolute Delight). Peter cat is also known for its sizzlers. The mutton hamburger steak and the tandoori mixed grill are highly recommended. Most of their sizzlers are served with grilled vegetables or potato mash. My experience at this place has always been great. Maybe just slightly on the expensive side, but the quality of the time spent makes up for it. Highly recommended if you want to soak a bit of Park Street and a bit of Kolkata as well as enjoy good food.

One of those resturaunts which is too over hyped to get 5-4.5 ratings as far as food is concerned...however love their ambience and ofcouse the price of the food is quite resonable.
As far as food is concered loved their Dum-Ki-Ran as starter Chcken Bharta and nan as 
main course. Though peter cat is famous for its sizzerls and CHELO KAbebs. Yes chicken steak sizzler and mixed grill is one of the fav's.A must try though.

No amount of praises will do justice to their chelo kebabs. I dont live in Kolkata, but whenever I do go I make it a point to drop by for the chelo kebab fix. Whole of Delhi hasn't been able to come up with anything remotely close to it, which just adds to its USP. A special mention to their kabuli naan and reshami kebabs too. Just delicious.

A Sunday lunch can never be better than Peter Cat. Why restrict to lunch, any meal of the day in Peter Cat is worth every penny  you spend on it. Yes , it is that good a resto. As a result, i have been there a number of times when ever possible (financially :P). But now that i have shifted my base to Hyderabad, frequency has gone down drastically. Nevertheless,  when ever i get an opportunity to come to Calcutta, i try to be here. This time, it was during the Durga Puja.
During Festivities, this place as most of us would know, is heavily crowded and so first thing one should expect is queue. Although waiting outside in the queue was quite a long time, but the wait for food (Peter cat ones) is something one should enjoy. That basically builds up the hunger and the makes the food even more satisfying.(i.e , if your a foodie! ). Anyway after a wait for half n hour, when you get to enter inside, the ambiance will definitely make up for all that you had to go through while waiting outside. The Lighting and the Decor is just perfect for any date. 

Coming to Food, i think one should go at least once to this resto to try out the chello kabab and hot sizzling sizzlers !! Like others, i can vouch for it any day at any point of time. So definitely try out the chello kabab and the chicken steak sizzler. I would not suggest mixed sizzler which would have chicken , mutton and prawns in the palette.Reason being it tastes a bit different with gravy all around, unlike the authentic steak sauce. I have also tried fish fingers here , and it goes perfectly with any beverages. 

Food is not too expensive , i would rather say it has a good value for money. Beverages , keeping in mind the resto, is also reasonably priced. 

Another plus point which this resto would offer you is it's superb and courteous service. Food may take a bit of time in being served to your table, but then again i don't mind waiting for quality stuff in that amazing ambiance. 

So to conclude, i would rate it in three sections according to their priority (top to bottom) and then overall :

Food :  5/5
Ambiance : 5/5 
Service : 4/5
Value for Money : 4/5 

Overall : 4.5/5

We were here earlyish on a Saturday evening, expecting it to be busy. We could get in after a wait of around 30 min and the six of us were forced into a table for 4. The crockery and cutlery remained for four, though there were some uninvited cockroaches on our table. The food was good but the service smacked of complacence and an attitude of "we dont care". The bill was provided early, even before we had asked for it.

i had heard about the famous peter cat and their trademark chello kebab about which alll my friends always gushed and raved! when i finally visited though, i found the menu to be good enough though with a tad expensive tag. we ordered pineapple coolers and sizzlers all of which tasted good but nothing great and cost quite a lot! back then i was a student and remember cringing a lot :P we didn't have their chello kebab though but had something else which were strictly nothing to go ga-ga about! cut to present- few weeks back i revisited the place with the sole purpose of chello kebab! it was served with butter rice which was amazing, veggies which were not so amazing, a poached egg which i dislike anyway and the mutton and chicken kebabs were ok-fine..nothing more -_- there really is nothing to be soo hyped about! there was a surprising winner instead- our starter prawn cocktail :D it was served stylishly in a wooden cocktail glass over ice, a lot of prawn with smooth, cool tangy dressing which we just loved!! i do want to go back to try out some other things but as for chello kebabs..nope! not going!
p.s- the atmosphere is not very nice..dim,smoky,raucous..no privacy and zero conversation stimuli -_- bleh

Visited peter cat yesterday.. This was my first time out there nd WOW.. What an experience..!! The ambience is excellent and the food mouth watering..
We were a group of 15.. Initially we had to wait for about 10 mins but were seated comfortably in two large family tables.. We ordered the Chelo Kababs.. Nd peter cat didnt disappoint us.. The food was served within 15 mins.. Nd it was just fantastic.. The taste was heavenly and the presentation wonderful.. If you take my suggestion, then do pls give this dish a try.. Although many may question the quantity of food served on the plate.. But it will surely satisfy your apetite.. Like we call it.. 'Its total paisa vasool' ..!! In the end its the quality that matters, not the quantity..!!

Well, first things first. Lunch at Peter Cat was actually not my choice. A friend of mine had suggested that we meet up for lunch at this place. Back then, I had absolutely no idea about the restaurant. I had zero expectations from the place. But I was awe-struck and overwhelmed at the food quality, ambience and overall look and feel of the place. Right away, we ordered the "Peter Cat Special" - Chelo Kebab. Since we were having a somewhat late lunch, we decided that a plate of Chelo Kebab would be filling enough. We also did not take up the waiter's suggestion of ordering for alcohol on the side, as we had planned for fun and drinks for later. The Chelo Kebab was indeed worth all the praise,accolades and recommendations. And it is definitely one of the must-haves on my list of great food, whenever I visit Park Street. Overall I would rate the restaurant as : 
Taste : 4.5
Quality :4.0
Ambience : 4.0
Value for money : 4.0

The most economical restaurant in Park Street and the food quality is very very good as well. Never ever miss their signature dishes - Sizzlers (House Special Sizzler is my favourite) and oh yeah - Chello Kebab. Statutory warning - not a good variety for non vegetarians and if someone tries typical Indian dishes like Paneer Makhani etc. I am not sure if that will be liked much

Location: Just beside Park Street Music World and opposite to Park St. KFC. I have been to this place many years ago (and did not visit recently mainly due to the long waiting time at the restaurant in recent times) and was always awaiting my turn for a more recent visit. The opportunity knocked the door yesterday evening when one of my cousin took few of us out for a 
treat at Petercat... We were a group of 10 and had to wait for 40 mins approx. but barring that .. WoW !!.. the feeling and the ambiance and food... just tasted the way it was before.. PERFECT !!

Serves: North Indian / Continental

Pros:
1. Food and ambiance tasted superb.
2. Service is awesome and quite prompt even during rush periods when the capacity is full.
3. Sizzlers are lip-smacking..just awesome !!...

Cons:
1. The price tag though has not increased much, the quantity has reduced in a plate. So you might be in for a surprise, if you plan to share a plate.
2. On rush days, it can take quite a toll on your patience. Quite a bit of waiting time, but probably worth it, if you have the luxury ! Also, they need to work on some mechanism to improve the waiting time (probably prior reservations..it may be 2 days in advance (say))... a -0.5 for this.
3. Chelo Kebaba lacks the earlier and original taste. Its more of a so-so now.  .. I would have given 4.5, but giving 3.5 (-1 for this as of now) until I see them improving on the quality / variety and quantity within the chelo-kebab which used to be one of their signature dishes !!

Cost for 2: Rs. 1000 (incl. tax )

Must Try:
-------------
Cocktails / Mocktails: Cinco Pie (Vodka and Orange juice) / El Boraccho (Lemon juice with Whisky)
Starters: Prawn cocktail (just love it.. had 2 of it... me and my wife) / Fish Makhmali... one the very few restaurant serving this quality of a fish starter... excellent !!
Main Course: Dum-Ki-Raan .. this is mind-blowing stuff.. the mutton will just melt in your mouth..have it with butter naan or butter tandoori roti (don't take paratha... its not that good) and the qty (full plate) will suffice 4 people for dinner / Chicken Reshmi Butter masala (gravy item)..you can have as Kebab also / Chelo Kebeb (this has deteriorated in taste.. the Kebabs r too dry and lacks the juicy flavor, especially the mutton seekh kebabs)
Sizzlers : House Special / Roast chicken .. this is a must have.. the sizzling sound, the aroma of the wine and brown sauce and the fried cabbage base... ufff!!... you will just enj'y it :)
Desserts: Tuttu Frutti / Peter Cat's Special

peter cat is one of the most heritage food places in kolkata just beside the Music World. Food was awesome. I really liked their food. Chelo kebab was mouth watering. chicken reshmi masala was also good. Ambiance was nice. I must say that the place is very much crowded. It was Saturday  Evening... we had to wait 20 mins more or less to get our seat but since my childhood i am fond of this place.

This resturant is sometimes I feel is overhyped....Definitely a nice and cozy place with perfect ambience...Chelo kabab did dissapoint me...But the sizzlers are really good If you think from a bengali point of view....Sizzlers are, I believe little bit manipulated with a touch of north indian style..Biriyani is also good beyond the expectations...Cons are their overhyped chelo kabab is not upto the expectations, their family sections and bachelors sections are separated in such a manner that families are given a seat near the bar and bachelors are given seats away from it. We went to this place in a particular Sunday for my birthday treat and they seeing us all bachelors thought that we would order wine so they didnt allow us to enter the family section..We told we were not interested in wine still they kept telling that they have a particular decorum to follow. So we had to wait 90 minutes to get our seat.

This one is a tough one to judge as this is a public favorite. Very difficult to get in during holidays and Fridays. Be prepared to wait for 45 mins to 2 hours on some days. The usual suspects like the chelo Kabab are not as good as projected. Go for the sizzlers, but do not expect too much. Just across the road there are better options. Its a good strategy to put your name in the Waitlist for 2-3 restaurants at a time, and place your family member stratigically to get a table as soon as possible. visiting this place is more of a 'tell tale',the food is just passable.

There was a Cat. His name was Peter... That's the rhythmic syllable I used to remember Peter Cat with since my adolescence. But surprisingly, paid my first visit yesterday only. I had a huge expectation out of ambiance,  chello kebabs, chicken marakesh, sizzlers & so on.... But ALAS...!!!! Food is HIGHLY OVERRATED, priced TOO HIGH, service was WORST, cover spacing was cramped, AC was too chilled to enjoy (?) our foods warm... & so on!! Surprisingly, I found 1 waiter was appointed in front of the restrooms just to open doors of the restrooms (including powder rooms too...!!) Anyways, let's come back to F & B. I ordered chicken steak sizzlers, assortment of kebabs, chello kebabs, chicken marakesh, tooty frooty for dessert & whisky as beverage. 1st my scotch was served in a high ball glass..!!! When asked to provide old fashioned glass, the waiter replied, all whisky glasses were occupied...!!! Chicken steak sizzlers were filled with potatoes only, chello kebabs were dry, hard & difficult to swallow. Marakesh would also follow chello's. Dessert was well.... so so... RECOMMENDATION:  NO, NEVER

Peter cat....it is supposed to be a landmark restaurant for kolkata.the staff behaves horribly. The guy standing outside the Gate is extremely rude. I saw him shout at another customer! places are automatically created for some people while those waiting for a longer period are left fuming. They actually suggested that if u have a problem with their policy....u can get lost. If this doesn't ruin your appetite, when you actually get in, the poor quality of food definitely will. Some things are great...I accept....but some things are extremely tasteless. Very poor choice for vegetarians. The entire ambience has been kept dark. hides the tattered carpet and table cloths. all in all....a horrible experience. ...the are much better options out there...!

The legend lives with the best known preparation of sizzles starters. they call i the paradise for non veggies but we veggies even do have a great time in around the ambience of good food aroma. I like the place, i cherish its food and the in and around. Always crowded and well stuffed with a mixture of people, young's, family, working and everyone else. A lil heavy on wallet, but much heavier in satisfaction.

Peter Cat would definitely make it to the seven wonders of Kolkata, only question being to which spot !!!!!!!!!

I remember while writing a review for bar-b-q, i was amazed at the 900 votes it had with an average rating of 4.0, but right now i have got no words for the 1173 votes for peter cat with an average rating of 4.0. This review that am writing is more of an expression of gratitude and appreciation for the amazing food and memories it has provided consistently since my childhood.

If I were to recollect one of my first restaurant visits, PC would definitely be one of the first to strike my mind. Yes i would agree i was more fond of the veg burgers with a lot of fries and those huge revolving tables on the first floor when i was a child. Though the chelo kebabs and the sizzlers took over my madness for the burgers as I grew up but never lost the love for those tables that sends me to my childhood. 

I read a few reviews before writing mine and i found three things in common viz. the amazing chelo kebabs, ok sort of ambience and rude staff. Chelo kebabs are definitely crazy. No offenses meant, but i wouldn't want them to expand or renovate coz they have been like this for years and i would love them like this for a lot many years to come. I dont find the staff rude but that may be coz i already know what am going to order even before getting my seat so i dont interact much with them.

Coming to the basics, its a not so small but compactly seated restaurant located beside the recently closed down music world of park street. The place is divided into two floors with a pretty dim sort of lighting. I would advise one to take a seat by 12 noon or 7.30 in evening else there would be some waiting to do for a seat. The staff service is decently paced but waiting time is a bit long for sizzlers. Priced at insanely reasonable levels, i could order a veg sizzler and a chelo kebab with a cold drink and bill would just be 600.  

Other than grabbing the routine chelo kebabs, mix grill sizzlers or an occasional veg steak, i love their cherry cheese pineapple sticks which has gone out of most of the menus in kolkata. After having the aforesaid, whatever little space is left in my not so lil tummy, black dal and paneer makhani with a crisp tandoori roti ensures a fully contented way back home. Cutlets with a gratin,  kebabs are also great if someone wants a variety. There are quite a few varieties of desserts which are pretty decent.

If someone visits the place for the first time, one should expect some crazy food at very reasonable prices. Chelo kebabs and sizzlers are the must tries. But yes, a grand and a royal experience may not be the appropriate way to foresee the visit. 

For me, peter cat cravings have become a part of life and see them increasing overtime instead of dying out !!

Planned for having the lunch in peter cat on 11th.
We ordered a bud and whiskey along with sizzlers i.e. mixed tandoori. As usual sizzler was superb. No complains.For the main course we ordered the chelo kebab mutton. But the waiter told that it would be better if we go for the original chelo kebab. I was disappointed with the chelo kebab. Rice quality was not at all good. Taste was not same as the one I had days back when I was in Kolkata a year ago. Dont know if chef kr cook is changed or not but the Taste and flavour that chelo kebab earlier had was missing this time.
Also I had to wait 10-15 min for billing. The waiter literally bought 3 machine for card payment. None were working!! The fourth one worked.
--------------------------------------------------------
Hearrd bout this restuarant earlierwent for dinner. had to wait for about 15-20 min. great place. ambience is vry good. we ordered chelo kabab. lykd it. food was good. lovd almost evrything...food, place, ambience, environment...nd CHELO KABAB....
If u go there dont forget to book the table first otherwise u may hav to wait...this is my personal favorite...:)

The place is famous for serving the best Chelo Kebab in the city and that is exactly what me and my friend ordered when we visited it. We went on a weekday in the peak lunch hours and yet could easily find a place to sit but the place is full during weekends. The dish contained rice, butter, chicken reshmi kebabs, mutton seekh kebabs and salad. The chicken kebabs were very juicy and tasted great but I was a little disappointed with the mutton ones which were very chewy and tasted burnt. Will visit again to try other dishes available on the menu.

Peter Cat.. A famous name in kolkata restaurant circle.. dissapointed me... its just showmanship without the true flvour of food that we went for.. one of the worst biriyanis in kolkata.. additionally, the chello kaba for which it is famous.. is just a myth.. its a homemade omlette without salt and some boiled basmati rice, with a stick of kabab placed on one side of the dish.. which is almost unnoticable conpared to the expectaion and hype.

The sound of hissing sizzlers being passed around and the sight of the black cat-whiskers on gold means it's a day at Peter Cat and it's time to start licking your paws in anticipation of upcoming pleasures of the palate! The chelo kebab is definitely the showstopper and since it's so filling, I have hardly ever tried anything else. But the cocktail sausages are quite good as appetizers and go well with any of the drinks out of their alcohol menu which is again extremely cute with the cheeky names and the 'price-ranging' of the drinks and the surprisingly low prices!

First things first ‚Äì Peter Cat is my favorite restaurant in Kolkata, by far. I first ended up here by accident, and since then every time I visit Kolkata I try visiting Peter Cat. It‚Äôs just a wonderful place.

Food here is positively brilliant. There are no other words for it. Admittedly, I have not been through the whole menu here, but that‚Äôs because I love a couple of their items so much, I end up ordering one of those.
1.	Chelo Kabab: I am not sure what the history of this dish is and who invented it, but these guys have perfected it. On the face of it, the recipe is too simple ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically buttered rice with kebab and sunny side eggs. But it‚Äôs this simplicity that makes it so amazing. It is surely among the best dishes I have tasted in any restaurant and the dish I actually miss a lot.
2.	The house special sizzler: Yes, it‚Äôs just a sizzler at the end of the day, but again, these guys know how to do it. I love the variety of meats that they serve, and even their vegetables are nicely done.
The ambiance is proper old school ‚Äì a healthy mix of colonial and royal. There is an attired durbaan at the gate, and attired waiters inside. Keep in mind that it can get crowded even on weekdays and you may have to queue. So be on time. And if you are ever on the Park Street in Kolkata, this is a place you must, must try.

The experience was great , as a bangalorean ,I found this place to be very reasonable for the food , quantity and ambieance they provide.
The sizzlers and chelo kababs are a must try , the manager seemed to be really nice and the hospitality provided was commendable !! 
Would definately like to see better interiors...
This place is always packed  and would recommend you to reserve a table and a parking spot before going there.

Peter Cat needs no introduction indeed. Like most of us, I've been going there for years. The place has a lovely old world charm like many restaurants on Park Street and I think, even the menu hasn't changed much in the last 30-40 years. The staff are very courteous and the waiters are patient. The place is packed in the evenings and sometimes you may have to wait in a long queue to get a table. 

One thing I have always wondered about Peter Cat is how the food is always so consistent. They take tremendous effort to maintain that standard, which is amazing.  This restaurant is great for a slow meal, chatting and talking and looking at browsing through the amusing liquor menu with friends over a few beers which quite interestingly are served in old colonial tankards (*old world charm*). You have a range of Starters / Appetisers to choose from, my wife and I just love the prawn cocktail, which is prawns dipped in a creamy sweet and sour sauce served chilled in a goblet with ice underneath it. For the main course you can choose from a Indian / Continental spread, but for me it's always the Chello Kebab, which is a meal in itself. It's buttered rice with two seekhs of Mutton Kebabs and two seekhs of Chicken Kebabs with a fried egg and tomatoes. Love it ! No wonder it still remains packed even after so many years.

Peter Cat..the name itself evokes an enigma that is pretty much beyond sane description..Located at a stone's throw from my office, I often felt the urge to explore what was there within, behind the manned doors and the embellished PETER CAT inscription.Huge crowds throng the place throughout the year and that only accentuated my urge to give PETER CAT a serious 'go'. A few months back, I could no longer hold myself back and went there for the quintessential PETER CAT experience with my cousin sisters. The first thing that caught my attention was the ambience...Dimmed- lights do make for a surreal, pristine dining experience, but in PETER CAT's case, the place is too dimly lit for it's own good.I wouldn't be surprised if two people actually  bumping into each other is a regular occurrence here, given the lack of proper illumination and less-than-adequate space. Speaking about the food, I had pre- planned that I would order Chelo Kabab without second thoughts.We ordered two Chelo kababs and one chicken smoked sizzler..The food arrived within minutes..it told me something.They always keep chelo kababs ready whch could be served instantly and that's understandable..The average Kolkatan goes to PETER CAT to have Chelo kabab..Chelo kabab is as absolute neccessity here while everything else stands at a distant second position. The food was good, the chicken kabab pieces were ripe and succulent, though the mutton kababs didn't taste all that great. The buttered rice with the 'sunny-side-up' fried egg went well with the smoked salad and kababs,and you don't exactly mind the 280 bucks you shell out for this dish.My cousin said the sizzler tasted great (sizzlers are always fabulous, aren't they?) and I was pretty satisfied with my first ever PETER CAT experience. However, there's one glaring thing about this place that I distinctly disliked- the stewards. You can discern from their demanour that they don't want you to occupy your seat for long, as there's a long queue waiting outside (which translates to meatier business prospects). As soon as you finish your meal, they instantly ask you whether you need anything more.If your answer happens to be a resounding NO, they would promptly present the bill and stand there with their eyes firmly planted on the bill book. You pay the bill and they still don't leave, their eyes still gazing at you and insinuating-"your time's up, the next set of people are waiting outside..OUT YOU GO"..I found that boorish and to a certain extent, rude. The stewards are meant to be jovial, congenial and accomodating. A smile is the least that they can effortlessly afford, but sadly, the stone- faced stewards here don't exactly tempt you to come to PETER CAT again.I would go with a humble 3.5 for PETER CAT for precisely this reason..
For me, BAR-B-Q, which is a few meters away from PETER CAT, still stands the tallest amongst all restaurants in PARK STREET..

generally go there for the very famous chelo kebab which is the pick of the items if i would say...
but also their sizzlers are one of the best in kolkata...
add to it some quick service and brilliant ambiance...
its better to avoid the drinks which are priced on the steeper sides...take a pint of beer or two instead...

overall a must-go...

Its the one of the most old restaurant cum bar in park street area. Me and my friend went there actually to try the Chello Kebab after watching the review from zomato. But I afraid to say Chello Kebab is not the best dish of peter cat anymore. Other dishes are good, place is quite beautiful and big, nice and cool ambiance. Good place for couples, family. Service is also prompt, good managers and waiters.
Somewhat you can spend a pleasant evening with your loved ones.

The famous Peter Cat restaurent in Park Street, beside the now closed Music World, and famous for the Iranian Chelo Kebab.
I have visited this restaurent only once, that too to try their famous Chelo Kebab.
Simply delicious, the restaurent has kept its name upto the reputation it has built in so many years.
On any given day, expect it to be full-house. So the service is slow as expected.
The menu is good, but their signature Kebab is a must try.
With a simple decor, I rate the restaurent 4 out of 5, only for the food.

You go through the door and you are back a few decades in time. The place still retains the old world charm. The space is a bit cramped and the lighting isn't the brightest, but thats kind of part of the charm.

The menu hasn't expanded much over the years. But if you are a non-vegetarian then you have enough options. The chelo kebab is a must. The sizzlers are pretty good too.

There are long queues during peak hours on weekends and holidays and on these days, service takes time too. But at the end of it all the wait is worth it.

Peter Cat.. Though it needs no introduction since it is present from decades and is now part of the city's heritage but just for sake, it is located in Park Street near Music World and opposite KFC. But surprisingly enough, I made my first visit yesternight. I had heard a lot about it earlier and really wanted to try it but for some reason or the other, I wasn't able to. I went in with a lot of expectations, but frankly, I wasn't that impressed at all. It has this old world charm and all but the seating is very cramped and the stewards din't seem courteous at all. Then the time taken for service seemed forever. Coming to the food, It has a very limited menu for Vegetarians and needs improvement on that too. The portions were good especially the breads but the taste was ordinary. The kebabs were good to taste and so were the vegetables. The mocktails menu is very disappointing though it has a large variety of cocktails and liquors. Expect to shell out about 600 per head.

Not to be missed :
‚óè Chelo Kebab
‚óè Sizzlers

Visited here with my office colleagues last week. For many days, I had harbored in my mind the wish to have the legendary "Chello Kebabs" here............... and it was truly a delightful staff. The House Special Chicken Sizzlers and the Mixed Tandoori Grills were also equally great. The sauteed veggies along with these starters added to the grandeur of the dish ............. the only disadvantage is the non-acceptance of Maestro Cards here ..................... otherwise a wonderful gastronomic experience ...............would love to come back here time and again...............

Amongst all the restaurants from the Kothari Family, Peter Cat is an experience in itself! A foodie‚Äôs delight, though the whole city has undergone metamorphosis, Peter Cat stands out as an icon of bygone era. Original to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù the d√©cor along with their extensive menu hasn‚Äôt been changed since time immemorial! If you want relive the nostalgia of the swinging 60‚Äôs of Park Street, rush to Peter Cat‚Ä¶ The restaurant though it has continued with it original d√©cor still looks clean and their service is prompt. Numerous visits has made it possible to know the servers by name. The Chelo Kebab remains their signature dish even today followed by the sizzlers! Both the veg and non veg Chelo Kebabs are outstanding.. They have hiked the price but who wouldn‚Äôt in today‚Äôs day ans time to serve quality food..  If you are planning to hit Park Street on a lazy Sinday afternoon, Peter Cat is the place to be with a bottle of chiiled beer and Steaks. I still freak out on their prawn cocktail. The Indian menu is also extensive and one order Roti/Nan, Chicken Bharta, and Dal Fry. Their Mutton preparation is also good. After a hearty meal, one should not forget to round it off with tutty fruity!!!! 
Though I can go on and on about Peter Cat, there are certain things if worked upon can be done better.. The waiting outside sucks!!! It‚Äôs a popular eating place‚Ä¶ so insist on reservations like they do in west‚Ä¶ I am sure die hard fans of Peter Cat will not abondon it‚Ä¶ The waiters at times can be rude.. was there for dinner with my family and my little girl who just went about the table a couple of times.. I was told to control her as she was disturbing people at other table.. mind it she was NOT PLAYING AROUND!!!!. Last but not the least‚Ä¶ if you are planning to celebrate special occasions do not carry a cake or cut it elsewhere as they do not allow people to cut the cake and celebrate‚Ä¶ Most restaurants allow you to bring your cake and have it too‚Ä¶

Visited Peter Cat today on the day before my b'day! Ordered the original chello kebab. Nothing new needs to be said about the famous chello kebab, its mouth watering as always. If you are on a diet you shouldn't be having the chello kebab in the first place! there is dollops of butter to drown you! but you won't be complaining because its sinfully good. The old Calcutta charm greets you as soon as you enter through the gates. The lighting, the ambience, the friendly waiters gives you a glimpse of an era gone by, of the old Calcutta we have read in novels and seen in cinemas. Peter cat is part of Calcutta's heritage and hope they continue the legacy.

If you are new to Kolkata, have made some new friends, planning for a perfect dine-out with them and hoping to savor the most popular taste of the city, you will be left with the only choice - the Chelo Kebab in the Peter Cat!

Perhaps there is no foodie left in Kolkata who has not visited this place or tasted this particular item. A quintessential platter from their own kitchen, Chelo Kebab, serves as the main crowd-puller, and it does live up to its reputation greatly! But there are also other attractions of this restaurants. Their Fried Chicken Liver and Prawn Cocktail are the unsung heroes of the appetizers. The Fish Makhmali and the Chicken Shahi Korma taste surprisingly wonderful; most restaurants usually cook these items in a very cliche flavor. 

Apart from the North Indian cuisine, Peter Cat also houses a wide range of sizzlers, which are quite capable to provoke your taste-buds! Though I would suggest not to go for their seafood options which eventually do not include a number of varieties.

The desert section is a fantastic experience here. Most are regular items, but are evidently served with a special care in the making. The cocktail section is satisfactory but seriously needs to consider adding new varieties to the list.

P.S. The ambiance is oh!-so-fantastic, complemented with a unique course menu and a graphic cocktail menu. But be prepared for a waiting period of more than an hour if you have chosen to enter the premise at weekend/holiday!

This restaurant needs no introduction or reviews as is proven by the large cues waiting outside the restaurant almost every other day of the week. This restaurant has still managed to maintain its aura and charm along with impeccable dining experience. Its Chicken Steak sizzler, Mutton Hamburger Steak Sizzler, Non Veg Chelo Kebab are some of the delicacies we all go for. The pocket pinch is reasonable i.e. roughly Rs. 500 per head and the service is decent.

Peter Cat is one of the legendary outlets of Park Street. This place is in the list of every foodie!  It is located just beside the spot where Music World used to stand and be prepared to be greeted by a long queue outside if you try to go during the rush hours without prior reservation.

The d√©cor and ambiance is very cozy inside. Peter Cat has astoundingly still managed to maintain its ‚ÄòBritish Era‚Äô feel through all these years. The waiters and staff are very well mannered and helpful. Now for the food, it serves the legendary Chelo Kebab ‚Äì the trademark dish containing rice with butter, kebabs and a friend egg. The sizzlers are amazing as well. The price is also very reasonable.

In all my visits I don‚Äôt seem to have any complaints. Peter Cat has managed to maintain its consistency in all departments very well even after so many years.

My grandfather and I used to go to Peter Cat on rainy weekdays after school. We'd find our table and spend time over Chelo Kebabs and thums up! The one thing about Calcuttans is we love our Thumsup, so much so that even while we were at college in the UK, we'd make sure we visited Euston in London to find our fix from the local Gujarati vendor! 

Peter Cat has been a favorite through my childhood. I still make it a point to visit Peter Cat on my trips to Calcutta. 

If you're ever in Calcutta, make sure you go here!

A must to try place when you in kolkatta.. my taste buds will never forget the bengali food experience which I had in my small visit of four days to kolkatta.

Being a veggie, I was not having high hopes from kolkatta.. but tried vegetable chelo kabab as waiter suggested it is their signature dish and I have to say, he was right. Very Nicely cooked food and served hot dish was amazing.

Park street is famous for various things but will say peter cat adds one more star to that.

Spoiler Alert : Waiting period can go more than 1 hour so better book in advance or the moment you come to park street first book here and then roam around and come back at your designated time.

Going to peter cat is as good as getting a paid insult, Heavy waiting qeues for a table, Finally after getting one, you will suffer with the service. The prawn cocktail was pathetic, the service guy denied taking order for the special kebab of the day as its going to take 20 mins for them to prepare. still moving on we decided to handle it patiently and go for main course and again came to us was the same dissapointment, anyways took a garlic naan & mutton nawabi which they could crunch in before they close for the day. Finally the guy adviced its already closing and will not be able to help with desserts, horrifying experience, will never ever be go neither suggest anyone to go. pathetic situation of customer service.

The name has a flavour of heritage attached with it. A castle dungeon like style to give you a magical ambiance. The Chello Kababs are the best. I specially liked their deserts(and the variety). Went there thrice and would like to come back again. I had a bloody marry which was really exquisite.

Cheers to peter cat we love you!!! 
The rush and que speaks for the kitchen staffs. Only if the gateman is a bit more polite in handling the que, would be nice.

Any day, any time - if its Peter Cat, I am ready for it. My fav restaurant in Kolkata. One of the best ambiance, best food, best service, and best taste. I have been there with my husband, friends and family it suits the bill perfectly.  

Menu wise, To start with(Food), the 1. Prawn Cocktail. 2. Any time its Chelo Kebab, 3. Sizzlers - House Special, Chicken Steak & Tandoori Mixed Grill. And one of the best Screw Driver I had here. In Peter Cat, I never go for variety of dishes cause I already have few selected dishes and I always go for them. And the service is quite good and they are very helpful in case of choosing the right menu(if you are there for the 1st time).

Always, "A big Thumbs Up for Peter Cat"

We decided to have lunch at Peter Cat, last Sunday and therefore started a little early knowing that it would be difficult to get a seat if we went late.However , as we were the first to check in , we decided to seat below.
Having ordered for Mixed Grill Kebab, we had to wait for more than 30 minutes when at last the sizzling dish was brought to our table.
I for one was very disappointed by the look of the¬† same.We found it to be very ordinary and could term it as very poor to taste.We¬† asked the steward for Afghani Chicken & Kabuli Nan.Here again we were absolutely dejected with the Afghani Chicken.....there were four chunks of chicken in a gravy and the pieces were absolutely hard & dry from inside.Save the Kabuli Naan everything else was bad.

If any place screams of the Park Street grandeur, it has to be Peter Cat. I mean sure, the Chello Kebab is not the same as it was say, 5-6 years ago. The portions are smaller, tastes a bit less brilliant, but the place still retains something which people can't really explain. You feel familiar the instant you walk in, you feel like you are in Park Street. It is still one of the more reasonable places to eat in the area. It remains a personal favourite, if only for the feel. You might be a tad disappointed if you expect the food to blow your mind though.

Peter Cat is one of my favourite in the Park St area. An oldie and has remained the same as far as I can remember. The decor, the food, the waiting outside for a table has all remained the same. The Chelo Kabab and the Sizzler are still delicious and are a hit all the way for the Kolkatan's like me. It's easy on our pocket too from the time we were out of college. I still find excuses to go back time and time again.

Imagine, a cold night in Kolkata and you are passing through Park Street. Ultimate hunger bothers you, you stop your car and decide to have something hot, maybe Sizzlers. If this is the same situation with you can just think of one restaurant "Peter Cat". It is the first and the last word for Sizzlers in Kolkata. The restaurant is located in the food capital of Kolkata, Park Street.  Despite the restaurant is very big and has lots of tables, but you will find yourself waiting outside the restaurant for tables to be free even on weekdays. On weekends or festive occasions, a good wait of 40mins-1hr is expected. Earlier while waiting, you could roam around Music World next to the restaurant but it is now closed, so waiting would be boring. However your waiting finally pays as entering the restaurant you will find a nice essence sizzlers and kebabs in the air.

Talking about the food, I am on the same boat with most of the foodies in here. My favorites House Special Sizzler and Chello Kebab. The sizzlers available here could be quite expensive but as I said earlier, the price pays as no one in Kolkata can match the taste of such sizzlers.

Coming to the restaurant, service time is super fast and you will be served within 15-20minutes of your order. If you have ordered sizzler, keep in mind to drag your chair a bit far of the table while serving, though the waiters are extra careful but there is always a chance of hot sizzles on your face. Aesthetics wise the restaurant does good job, you have dim lighting inside the restaurant which makes up mood if you are on a date.

To sum up, I give Peter Cat a 5 star. My only wish would be if they could expand their existing branch or come up with a new branch. I believe that expanding the existing branch by a floor would be difficult as the building where Peter Cat is located was once a part of deadly fire and is still unstable from top. So coming with a new branch in some posh area will be a great idea.

One of my first experiences of eating out was in Peter Cat. Over time a lot of new options have come up since but still one cannot forget Peter Cat.

Peter Cat holds back the certain colonial era "Calcutta" culture with waiters with red turbans and people managing with suited attire.  Food is still amazing - offers a wide range of indian and kolkata style continental dishes.

My favorite is of course "Chello Kebab" and "House special sizzler". Chello Kebabs are one of kind combination - rice with butter , a fried egg and melt in your mouth kebabs.  I think perfect for every pocket - each of this is a meal in itself. Have tried a few other items like Irani and Reshmi Kebabs. 

The place is worth - although I do think the place needs visually reinvent itself in a way to make it more appealing across new generation of eateries :)

The chelo and marakesh still tastes heaven, though, they probably just make them prepared and warm them as you order now a days. Sizzlers are as good as in their sibling across the road, so do the desserts and please try the kebabs, specially tandoori chicken and Irani kebab. Juicy succulent pieces of divine magic, so perfectly marinated and grilled to perfection. Mouth watering indeed.

Peter Cat is heritage. For any person born and brought up in Kolkata, You can't be a true Calcuttan unless you have had Peter cat's Chelo kebabs. 

But there's other delicacies too, like baked fish with tartar sauce and very very surprisingly, their chicken burger. It's one of the most expensive as well as yummiest chicken burgers I have ever had. It's big and they give a lot of fries and salad with it. Yum!

Also, the sizzzlers are good, if you don't want to be too experimentive. Peter Cat is a choice for when you want to enjoy some heritage. It's small, quaint, crowded, noisy with sizzles, with the feeling of being in another time and place.

Well, had heard so much about Peter Cat that I was really looking forward to visiting this place. But nonetheless I tried to keep my expectations in check !  Had to wait for some time to get a table....which is normal here i guess. When finally seated, we ordered the Mixed Tandoori Grill (which they recommend), Chicken Marakesh and ofcourse, the famous Chelo Kebab ! When the food arrived it looked awesome first of all.....and the taste was even more so ! The Chelo Kebab definitely needs no introduction....and was the best of the three. The Chicken Marakesh was kind of similar to the Chelo Kebab....served with capsicum instead of egg. But though the tandoori platter was good, it wasn't extraordinary...and left more to be desired. My sister said that considering the hype, she had higher expectations. I guess people are often disappointed with Peter Cat because they expect more. So keeping that aside, this place is definitely worth a visit.....4 stars from me, :)

Very bad service to say least, we even found hair on a plate, can you imagine. They are just surviving on the words of mouth, food is not also so great to overlook other deficiencies. People inside should at least try to be a little friendlier and decent, they behave as if we are grateful visiting their heritage resto.  A big thumb down.

After this year February , thought that once in the year meetup (due to waiting time) was done with Peter Cat. But last Friday while passing by the Closed Music World, thought let's give a try ; of course, seeing a smaller queue! We were 6 as four of the gang never been there so order chelo Kabab and half of the group was not a grat follower of continental food hence order Dum Ka Run with NaN. Once again the Chelo Kabab was great as expected even at 4:30 PM and after the huge Id crowd; here I must say the quality maintained by their cook is laudatory.Dum ka ran was also very good.
The thing is that Peter cat might work with the ambiance a little and second their speed of making the bill and swapping the credit card should be improved! But I think if we can count the best 3 Kebab in Kolkata, then the Chelo Kebab of Peter Cat will surely within them and hence we'll ignore all their lack of infrastructure whatever they might have and will go their and enjoy their food.

uff talking about Peter Cat only one dish item stands out from their menu and that is the cello kebabs.. indeed these kebabs are the pride of Peter cat and they have maintain the standards really well. Even the other items like sizzlers and the steaks is also not bad at all, continental food is terrific at Peter Cat. Definitely recommended. But i think that the place needs to be spruced up a but to create a good ambience for the customers to eat. Also the restaurant is very noisy at times, so the management needs to do something to keep the decibes down of the foodies coming to eat.

only for the food,nothing else.this place is affordable.their standard fare needs no further introductions,its classic.
from service to ambience,to the waiting queue,to the attitude of people working there,from the darwan to the fellow who cleans the plate-he will dump the whole bunch of plates on your table if you are chatting post your food,and are showing no signs to exit the restaurant..and yet all of them want to be tipped.
thing is you need them for their food,they have enough foodies even without you

The very famous Peter Cat and its iconic Chelo Kabab!
The place does not need much of a review.
Quantity and quality both are good.Ambiance is cosy and personal Price is definitely high due to its location and brand name.But its worth paying for the yummy food you get out there.Other than Chelo kababs, Sizzlers are also awesome.
On the other hand, waiting in a queue while there are elephants running inside your stomach is pretty irritating if you are not lucky enough to instantly find a seat.And another downside of this place is its too much noisy inside.Otherwise service is excellent.
In overall, its definitely a must must must for exciting your taste buds ;-)

This place is all nostalgia for me. I have lost count of the number of times I have visited this place with my friends and family. I still vividly remember that first time when I visited Peter Cat with my father. The Chelo Kebabs tasted the exact same way this week, as it did 15 years back on my first visit to this famed dining destination of Kolkata. The loyalty of the people coming here has not changed much even with the advent of so many new restaurants in its vicinity and throughout Kolkata.
The staff is very well behaved and friendly. Serving time is decent enough and the portions are fine too. All the Continental dishes are good to taste, though I would advise against trying out the typical Indian dishes. Special recommendations are Chelo Kebab, Irani Kebab, Chicken Sizzlers and the Chicken Stroganoff. It is a favorite hangout of a lot of people residing and visiting Kolkata. So be ready to stand in the long queue for entry.

Peter Cat... "Naam To Suna Hi Hoga!!!"
This place is probably THE most popular restaurant in Park Street. People swear by the Sizzlers these guys serve. The cuisines they make are pretty awesome, to say the least. The dishes I will like to highlight are:
Mutton Shammi Kabab, Fish Makhmali, Chicken Irani Kabab, Farah, Shikar, Dum- Ki- Raan, Chelo Kabab (original), Chicken Marakesh, Nawabi, House Special sizzler, Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler and Fried Beckty with Tartare Sauce.

In short, food here equals to Bliss (check out the capital B).
Service is in the range of okay to good.

On the downside, one generally has to wait for quite some time outside before being able to get in. This is due to the huge rush this place meets with on a daily basis. I prefer avoiding this place during the Durga Puja since I am not sheerly fond of standing in queue. The other slight negative this place has is that it feels a bit crammed up with the tables set up so close to each other. 
But hey, anything for good food. ;-P

If you have enough time to spare, and stand in Que with large number of people thronging outside.. then this is the correct place. During my college days, I remember, with friends, it was fine with us to stand  in the que and pass time talking sweet nothings..but now when you come with your family, with little ones asking when they will let you in...it becomes difficult..

We ordered two portions of chicken asparagus soup (Rs.122.00 per portion) for four of us and one plate each of tandoori prawn (Rs.370.00), roast chicken sizzler (Rs.220.00), chicken Marrakesh (Rs.270.00) and Chelo kebab (Rs.270.00), the greatest signature dish of the restaurant! For dessert, we chose chocolate souffle (Rs.120.00). While the soup was good in quantity and with right aroma, tandoori prawn had only six mid-sized species. The roast chicken sizzler was passable but the over hyped Chelo kebab was downright greasy; we rather liked the other variant, kebabs in chicken Marrakesh better. Chocolate souffle came in a large quantity to cater to famous Kolkata sweet tooth! 

Considering plus and minus.... its 3 from my side.

One of the best restaurant in town. It is a must vist place and one of my top favourite.I have visited this place 6-8 times and I was never dissapointed. This place is very famous not only because of food but the ambience, decor, service and the hanging dim lights which are also amazing. The famous Chelo kabab and sizzlers are the most common dishes which people try but kababs, fish fingers and desserts are also too good. People from different cities visit this place whenever they are in town it is so famous. But the only negative thing is you have to stand in long queues and wait for your turn to come. The servicing of food is also lil slow comparitively but apart from it no other flaws. the staff is very polite dressed in white pathan suits righly designed with the interiors of the restaurant. Do also try the mocktails and cocktails as well. Prices are on the higher side but you will never regret for spending on such great quality and super tasty food.

By looking at the number of reviews and favorites, it is obviously a very famous restaurant in Kolkata, situated in Park street.

So since its popular, so it is also crowded, whether weekdays or weekends, lunch or dinner. I dont like the waiting part but then again, i dont have any option.

My all time favorite in Peter Cat is the Dum-ki-Raan. it is the entire leg of the mutton. The meat is so soft, juicy and tendor. It is full of flavor and the best I have ever eaten.
The prawn cocktail is worth a try, and the bake chicken too (if you like cheesy cheesy stuff)
And ofcouse the ever famous Chelo kebabs and House special sizzler.

Peter Cat invokes such pleasant memories of Kolkata that i am biased to the place and occasionally forgive the blips in food quality. Like some other places, it has to be savored as a complete experience - Christmas time after a walk at Park Street - thats when it will stay with you.
Since i dont live in Kolkata, i always go the place for their iconic chelo kebabs. And am never disappointed - succulent kebabs on butter loaded warm rice ! 
I find the rajma galauti kebabs also pleasantly amusing. People i go with never show much enthusiasm to order it but i think its worth the bites. Nayantara biryani is fine - definitely royally loaded - can get heavy.

I wish they took their desserts seriously. The ice cream fare is just not the thing !
and yes i like the quirky drink menu too :-)

Peter Cat gives you an all Royal dining feel. "Except for the occasional visit by the Cockroach." The food here mind you is not exceptional nor is the selection. The USP of Peter Cat is that it serves as an brilliant hanging out place. Perfect for a get-together or perhaps a family dinner. It is very conveniently priced and thus can be claimed affordable. Starters here are lip-smacking but lack quantity " of course ".  The famous Chello kabab does prove to be a worthy delight. A selection of a range of liquors and an eclectic choice of cocktails is the cherry on the cake. That is particularly why I would call this one of my favourite dine-out destination.Service is good, Can't seem to complain.
Hence, if you are interested in a Royal British Indian Dining experience with authentic food, Peter cat is your place.
But again, They really need to take care of their pest issues or perhaps that is also a measure to make it a more historic experience of colonial India.

Chelo kebab - their signature dish has let me down when I took one client out for business lunch. Kebabs were not that bad but something was missing... But I was surprised to find cold rice topped with butter.. I heard Peter Cat and Mocambo has same management and since my terrible experience at Mocambo recently, I am not surprised anymore.... Bye Peter Cat - enough of your Chelo Kebab.. I better have rolls from the corner snack bars than your food.

This place honestly doesn't even need a review. The food is great, and the ambiance is good, and the staff are well mannered and know their job. Prices might seem to be on the higher end of the spectrum, but I feel that its completely justified. I usually write lengthy reviews, but this time i feel that you, reader,  should just go ahead and discover this place yourself (if you already haven't). I am sure you wont be disappointed. The staff at zomato would probably feel that im not doing my work properly. But, this place makes me humbly bow down to good food.

Be it the dry chilli chicken, chello kabab or a mixed sizzler or even the tartar sauce to keep up with the fish fry Peter Cat holds a lot if significance to many people who love Park Street. I really love the dim lit place with the smell of cigarettes and booze and also the occasional sizzle of the sizzlers...Very homely and very nostalgic!!

Food is good but the attitude of the guy taking order is worst. He is not fit for hospitality industry, could try his luck in something else where one does not need to communicate politely. He is very rude and all he wanted us to consume the kebabs as soon as possible and pay the bill. The reason could be there is a long queue waiting outside. I went there with my friend but would not recommend this place to anyone specially to a small group of 2-3 people.

Peter Cat is probably the most popular restaurant in town.Whenever you visit the place you will find people waiting outside.It will be hard to find someone who has not visited this place.
I have been to this place numerous times.I feel while there is surely substance behind the popularity of the place,the quality has slightly gone down of late.And the prices have gone the other way.But still it remains a restaurant worth a visit.
The house special sizzler,dum ki raan,mixed grill sizzler,chelo kebabs are few of my personal favourites.The ambience is nice and the service is good.

The Chelo Kebab is almost legendary - but that causes some people to expect too much and not enjoy it so much.

That said, it a definitely a very good, reasonably priced, filling dish.

I also recommend the Broccoli.

Cons of Peter Cat - they are due to its popularity - difficult to find parking, almost 1 hour waiting at times. Sometimes the interiors feel a bit stuffy.

All in all, a must visit for everyone who visits Kolkata.

It is one of my favourites, but mostly out of nostalgia and memories than the actual food that is served now.

The iconic Chelo kebab, to put it simply, is a dish of rice, kebabs and eggs. In the past couple of years, I have had it quite a few times. But I fail to find the taste that excited me when I was a kid. Now on a whole, it is not a bad dish, but if I were to be pedantic about it, it certainly no longer deserves the hype and praise it gets. The chicken kebabs are no more tasty than the regular Chicken Reshmi Kebab you find at mid-range Biriyani places in Kolkata. The mutton kebabs have always had that same exotic blend of spices that you kind of grow tired of at the end of the meal. In fact, more than once, I had not been able to finish off the second stick of mutton kebab because after a while, the spices become too overpowering for my taste. The rice, on almost all occasions, has been not warm enough to melt the cubes of butter stuck in it and the AC fast cooled the rice further to make a very unappetizing, grainy component of the dish. The egg on top miraculously disappoints me every time! The egg yolk is supposed to be golden and oozy and the whites are supposed to be clear white, but I always get a fried egg where either the egg whites have goldened and curled up and yolk is inevitably nearly hard-boiled. I don't even know how they manage that because even in all my failed experiments to cook an egg, I have never been able to hard-boil an egg by frying! 

The sizzler, another much-hyped dish, is perhaps less of a disappointment because I don't particularly care for it. The potatoes are slathered in a sauce that has a slightly sweet taste, which I like better than mashed potatoes that often come lumpy or under-seasoned. I personally would like the carrots to be sauteed than boiled, or if they insist on serving it boiled, I think it should be boiled with a pinch of salt because it tastes really bland. I didn't like the Chicken steak and the Mutton Hamburger steak had a taste strangely similar to the mutton kebab in the Chelo dish.

The Indian dishes fail to impress. Frankly, if I crave some Indian food, I'd rather go to places which charge half the price for the dishes and give the same quality of food.

However, unlike a lot of other reviewers, their service didn't seem off for me. The waiters weren't overtly friendly, but polite enough and made suggestions that, so far, hasn't failed me.

Call me a stubbourn Kolkatan if you like, but despite all the small disappointments, I'd go back to Peter Cat, wait half an hour just to sit down with friends and family and have another Chelo Kebab.

It was a wish nurtured for toooooo long- to have chelo kabab in Peter Cat. Since I am not basically from Kolkata, so never tasted Kolkata food much. Now when I go to Kolkata have to visit my in-laws and other relatives places, and after eating there it is really difficult to make some place in stomach for some restaurant food.
We went to Kolkata during Holi, and this time we targeted two things--one, we should go to either Peter Cat or Mocambo and two- we should go to Tengra for Chinese food.

So one fine day I went to Peter Cat for the famous chelo kabab. We went around at 8PM, and even that time also there was decent waiting. We had to wait for almost 202-5 minutes. The sad part is- there is no waiting lounge. So one had to loiter around on the street.
Ordered just one chelo kabab as had the plan of completing the next part of meal in Mocambo (more restaurants per meal  ). It came, we tasted and got disappointed. I mean, comeone, we had heard so many things about Chelo Kabab--everytime a friend visits Kolkata he/she goes to Peter Cat for chelo kabab and post that in FB. I guess Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial would come later than Chelo Kabab in terms of numbers of photos posted in Facebook. The huge anticipation is just blown away. It is just plain ricotto rice with a cube of butter on top, murgh malai kabab and mutton sheikh kabab in a single plate. 

My wife suggested that may be the unique arrangement was very new the time the dish was introduced and thus people went gung-ho over this. Might be. But then, on the same logic, a McDonalds meal would also be a greaaaaaaat meal, would not it?

Like to categorically mention that the taste of the dish was not all bad. It was very good. But with so much hoopla over it, thought it to be some nice innovative thing which, sadly to many people's disliking, is not.

Its Peter Cat! for any Kolkatan, that information is good enough. For the rest, Peter Cat is more of a landmark restaurant that completes Kolkata, the only sad part about this restaurant is its long ques, especially during the weekends.

Chelo Kebab is their signature dish and it is highly recommended!!

tick this one off your to-do lists. really, peter cat suffers from a tendency to use a surfeit of oil and spice. balance and judgement is lacking in the food. and whatevr anyone says, stay clear of the the chello kebab.
i always eat at a restaurant at least thrice before i write a review, and peter cat has always let me down. considering i'm an optimist, i will eat there again, and i hope i'm proven wrong. 
ultimately, restaurants like peter cat rely of "afwa", similar to what makes movies like yeh jawaani hai dewaani work. if nach gaana and soppy cliched story lines are your thing, you'll love peter cat. if you want great food, well balanced flavours, and polite hospitality, you'll miss by a wide margin.

Situated in the famous food street of Kolkata, Peter Cat is a must dine in place for all. People visiting this place must try the hot sizzlers and the mouth watering Chelo Kabab for sure. The food quality is good and the quantity is sufficient. Be prepared to wait in a long queue if you're planning to have dinner here on Sundays.

I have been to this restaurant at least 20 times since I have actually started to eat out with my friends. 

This place is a must visit in Calcutta for its sizzling sizzlers and the authentic chelo kebab platter.

My personal favourites are the House Special Sizzler and the Tandoori Mixed grill sizzler. The taste is equally good at every visit. The place is always packed at peak lunch and dinner hours even on weekdays. So expect a waiting time of 15-20 minutes if you are visiting during proper meal hours. 

A meal for two would set you back by Rs 800 - Rs 1000 but it is totally worth it :)

Peter cat: one of the names which you associate with the city of joy! One thing you should keep in mind is the long line that form on weekends and holidays. So if planning to go on aforesaid days it's advisable to reserve your tables. Now coming on to the ambiance, it is dimly lit with nice decor, which is perfect for a dine-out with that special someone. Now, the food. Need I say anything about the famous chelo-kebabs! The rice with the dollop of butter cubes is just heavenly. So is the chicken kebabs that was served with it. But was disappointed with the mutton kebabs as it was not as smooth as I would have liked. But overall the food was good, 4/5. As for the other things in our order, the bhetki was awesome. All-in-all a good experience. Definitely gong back.

Peter Cat is one of those places which should be included in the list of must-visits in the city, if there exists such a list. I've had good as well as bitter experiences here, coming to that later. 
The food is splendid, Chelo Kebab is a must, the Peter Cat special sizzler is great and the prawn cocktails I had were better than most other places. What might irritate you is the place is very noisy and crowded than most would prefer and waiting times are quite ridiculous. Once, we were waiting for close to 1 and half hours before deciding to eat elsewhere. If, you're going in a big group it would be a good idea to make reservations.

One of the most reputed and old restaurants at Park Street in Kolkata. I really like the vintage ambiance. I have visited this place so many times since my higher secondary days at St. Xavier's College that I have lost counts. Its signature dish "Chello Kabab" is my all time favourite. You can also go for "Sizzlers" and the prices is also not sky-high. I will always recommend this restaurant to my outside Kolkata friends for a must have vintage Kolkata food experience!

One of the most famous restaurant of park street. One has to be in a long queue before getting chance for a meal. Ambience is good. Price is high, most of the dishes costs around 250/-to- 300/-. Service is good. Mainly they use copper wares while serving, representing the Traditional Indian way of showing Hospitality.
Coming to the food, We have tried:-
Dum Ki raan : It's a spicy gravy dish, can be shared by two. The taste is good but the mutton they provide is not soft.

Tandoori mixed grilled : It's a spicy sizzler served with cooked vegetables,big tender piece of chicken, mutton sausage and egg. Taste is good and quantity is sufficient for one person.

The famous chello kebab at around 295/- : the combination of fine rice with butter, egg poach and chicken kebab gives it an awesome taste. Along with this they also provide a two strips of mutton kebab ( not very good) and salad. The quantity is less for a male bengali foodie

Given the hype that surrounds the name, I had high expectations and was completely let down. I braved a 2 hour long queue on a hot & humid Sunday afternoon to taste the venerated 'Mutton Chelo Kebab'. What I got was a cold platter that had cold rice with a bulk of cold butter, surrounded by cold kebabs. On my second visit, I was served a highly unseasoned 'Subz Biriyani' with similarly unseasoned paneer. On my third visit, the sizzler was okay, but I certainly have tested better sizzlers at smaller places.
It must be my bad luck that I faced such food where most people go thronging back all the times. But after three tries I have given up on this place and will never visit again.

Before anyone freaks out regarding such low ratings, let me just say that it is absolutely on the basis of the veg food they serve.

The ambiance is a 5 on 5, and the menu cards too.

We had ordered the tomato soup- which was good though a but too sweet for our palate.
 
The veg au gratin was nice, though a bit bland.

The main course was a disappointment though.
We had ordered veg nentara - it wasn't edible. 
The aalu matar was absolutely mediocre. 

There is a lot of scope of improvement atleast for the veg menu.

This place in park street is just numero uno experience. Everytime I eat here, I just cant get enough of its contents. Each and everything is so good to enjoy here that its a foodie's delight to enter this place everytime over and over. The Bloody Mary and the Screwdriver to start are scintillating. 

The Grilled Beckti is indulgence, and the heritage of the Chello Kebab is just Persian exuberance. Your mouth gets filled with the softness of buttered rice and egg yolk, while a bite of Kakori Kebab (a part of the dish) is a fusion of old Delhi and Iran. The salad serves their role too. The Don Giovani of Mozart is just as extravagant as the Chello Kebab. And if you can, have the Roasted Chicken Sizzler with Garlic Bread. 

The menu card starts with a poem written by a foodie, enchanted by the sweet music of peter cat cuisine, which is an awesome read. Had I been that lyrical, an ode would surely have flowed down my nib. Nonetheless, my ode to it is this review, which is a standing ovation to this culinary heritage of Kolkata.

I would recommend not to try ice creams as dessert. A five minute ride would get you to nearby Baskin Robbins counter with its whole lot of ice cream flavors. The ambience was pleasant but a bit crowded (but u cant help that). All in all it was a nice experience and will definitely visit again

I had been only once to this famed, renowned place! Well honestly the 1st thing you try here is the Chello Kabab. Well honestly it's not that awesome as one imagine it to be. Certainly good, but it won't fill your belly for a lunch or dinner. Sizzlers are good but again they are not cost-effective. As a college student, you can't afford to dine in this place occasionally, once in a while is good.

ambiance is awesome with old charm...mainly at the upstairs u will be amazed to see dimly lighted tables with comfortable couches...old fashioned waiters with their pathan dresses..and a continuous hissing sound of sizzlers served to the tables...it really takes you to the another world..
service is good..though the waiters seemed quiet non-professional or hi fi english speaking ones...but they are good and fast..
i think i am lucky enough that every time i went this place i didnt have to wait in a cue but always during coming out i realised that there are many persons felt relieved seeing us coming out of the gate..:p
 during our 5-6 visits we took many of their items including their sizzler and chelo kebab...all are excellent...but somehow i feel they are lacking in some points..like..the rice in chelo kebab should be hot so that the butter cubes melt...and i got better tuti-fruity in other restaurant..sizzlers are undoubtedly awesome...
its moderately expensive but worth of it..its not only a dining out...its an experience...

This place is a legend. The restaurant is located in Park Street and is one of the most famous restaurants in the city. Over the years, every calcuttan with an inclination towards good food has atleast visited this place once if not more. The place reeks of old world charm and the interiors deserve a special mention. The burgundy leather seats, the soft dim lights and the  cat shaped menu card. Its the small details of Peter Cat which attract you. 

The food deserves special mention as well. The famous Chalo Kebab, possibly as famous as the restaurant itself is the dish to try. Apart from that the sizzlers are also worth trying. The food is definitely good and service is pretty decent.

However a few problems do exist. Firstly, the long waiting time even on sunday afternoons is a big spoiler. Car parking is another big issue. The rush of the restaurant results in a pretty overworked staff who tends to rush as well leading to a detoriation in service at times. 

Recommended if you want to soak a bit of Park Street and a bit of Kolkata as well as enjoy good food!!!!

Peter cat ---one of my favourite in park street area.I think its needless to say something about their chello kebab.Its a real treat for your taste buds.I also like their biriyani,someone will say arsalan or alibaba is better,but sometimes I prefer peter cat over arsalan.Its different,not that traditional kind of biriyani.Other items are also good.There is only one problem,most of the times you have to wait in queue.

This is one of the famous brand restaurants of kolkata but to tell the truth the quality of eating there has recently deteriorated.Being such a brand they should have learned to control huge number of customers.But unfortunately u have to wait there in a long queue until ur turn comes outside.. The atmosphere inside is still typical peter cat type with dim lights and smells of sizzlers all around to make ur tongue tickling..
Last month i visited peter cat with my girl friend and ordered the reputed chelo kebab, which has been their pride.. But to my disguise the quality has worsened.
 The 3 butter cubes which are served with hot rice should melt due to the hot steam of rice. But the rice wasn't hot enough to make them melt.U might have to chew them to melt. Secondly the taste of mutton kebab was not that good.The spices were not deeply fried so we got the intense smell of them.Chicken kebabs were awesome though..
Lastly the service during my visit was very poor. A waiter came up and demanded to know what out order was. The order was taken in a most surly manner.They behave as if they are the heads of the restaurant and doesn't even bother about customers.The basics are not followed but when u ask for cocktails or brewed drinks they would not give u unless u provide a valid ID proving your age although u look like over  the age of 21...
Hence i would like to give them only 3 out of 5 regarding my last visit to peter cat. .

The little details i loved about this restaurant are the cat shaped menu card,a separate table mat for serving the sizzler,the unique way of keeping the prawn cocktail chilled by placing the bowl in an ice  container! Like all the foodies,we ordered a sizzler,an original chelo kebab and both the dishes are truly their signature! We also ordered prawn cocktail,Shah nauz and chef's recommended Beckty Meunier..all the dishes are splendid! loved their presentation as well! Cosy ambience! Every Calcuttan must try this restaurant once!

The food here is divine.The best part is the fact that the taste hasn't changed a bit from the time I was taken here i.e. my childhood until now.
The food is awesome especially the sizzlers and chelo kabab,so is the prawn cocktail,the mutton and chicken dishes and not to forget the so so soft naans and breads.And when it comes to dessert nothing can top the creme caramel.Everytime I'm here the first bite I take to the last piece I travel in my own food hallucination :P But when you eat here all you can say is ummmmmmm and ummmmmm and ummmmmm.......Its a  DIVINE feeling that I cant explain in words completely.

Peter Cat has become too famous for its own good. Many years ago, one would go there to enjoy good food and excellent service. These days, waiting outside in queue has become the norm. The queues form so early that entry into the restaurant becomes a major challenge.

Once inside, the decor might soothe one's eyes, but use of transparent glass and the lack of blinds in front of the tables just next to the door make eating there a very embarrassing experience. It is unsettling to watch people watch you eat, being uncomfortably aware that there is a silent wave of envy directed at you for being inside the restaurant while the people outside are not.

The service during my most recent visit was very poor. A waiter came up and demanded to know what out order was. The order was taken in a most surly manner. The dishes (four chelo kebabs and one sizzler) took a fair amount of time to arrive.

Though the Chelo Kebab is well-known in Calcutta because of Peter Cat, the sizzlers are better overall. The Chicken Marrakesh, ordered once as an experiment a couple of years ago) is bad.

This is a restaurant that should only be frequented if
i. one likes waiting in queues for what is now average food,
ii. one is escorting hapless non-Calcuttans who need to see/"do" all the places Calcutta possesses, or
iii. if there is any desire to be "seen" at Peter Cat.

This restaurant is one of those rare species which have retained its prestige through generations. If you are foodie ( not just alcoholic ) and ready to have some continentals, it is a must visit place for all ages.
First I will tell the negative parts. The main issue with this place is you have to wait a longgg time to before you can grab a table ( mainly because of the popularity but still sometime it is very annoying ). The second thing is the behavior of its staff. They are not friendly,they are not hostile but they are just indifferent to you.The suggestions from the person who is taking your order are also not the best ones.
But all this things disappears when the food is served. Environment is cozy ( but sometimes noisy depending on the crowd ), the place is dimly lit to set the mood for beverages. The mood is actually set when the starters are served ( u know, alcohol will remain alcohol. Neither one can worsen or heighten the taste of beer or whiskey i guess ).
Start with prawn cocktail and Cello kabab ; then order a few more kababs (Fish,chicken,Mutton everything is good; also can go for continental non-veg salads with mayo and boiled vegs). After that it is sizzler time. I dont think any economic restaurant at park st area serves these good types of sizzlers. Close this whole session with TootiFrooti.
Excellent food ( with alcohol ) @ very economic price @ very convenient location - Peter Cat is one of the favorite legends of mine in this city.

This is one of the famous  trio of restaurants on Park Street that has been consistently serving delectable cuisine for a very long time in our City of Joy.The other two being the obvious Mocambo and Bar-B-Q.A quick check of the ratings of these joints on this site would reinforce my point.¬†
07-Apr-2016

Visited the joint on a dull weekday afternoon with an old friend for late lunch.Surprisingly there was still a winding queue outside.Luckily we were ushered in within a couple of minutes.Ordered the following: Chicken cocktail sausage,Black Label strong beer,butter naan,masala kulcha,nalli gosht,chicken reshmi butter masala.Service was prompt.The chicken cocktail sausage comprised of top-notch quality chicken sausages sauteed in a sauce(most probably Barbecue sauce)who knows!!It was yum to say the least.The beer was served chilled in their traditional brass mugs.

In the main course the nalli gosht was unique.It comprised of two large leg pieces of tender mutton in a mildly spicy yellowish gravy.Just perfect to go with the soft and fluffy naan and the masala kulcha.The chicken reshmi butter masala comprised of 8 cubes of boneless chicken in a thick gravy.It was awesome as well. No scope of grudges on this golden oldies of Kolkata.As has always been the case i was never disappointed earlier and neither on my current visit.Cheers!!

Well coming on to the subject of my discussion-Food, If you want to try off-beat items try out the Fish Farah Kebab (Rs 265).The pieces of fish are juicy and succulent and the fish used was of top quality. The Chicken Tikka (Rs 205) was decent enough, though nothing special.For  lovers of red meat try dishes like Mutton Shikar (Rs 240) - a kebab item, Mutton Nawabi (Rs 230)-a spicy semi-gravy dish made up of really soft boneless pieces of mutton that melt in your mouth.Heavenly indeed! Peter Cat is known for its sizzlers in Kolkata and not without reason.The Dum ki Raan (Rs 315) and the Chicken Steak Sizzler (Rs 260) was excellent. People who prefer to have bread with their sizzler can order the same but it is charged separately. The Chelo Kebab (Rs 255)- a signature dish of Peter Cat is still consistently good after all these years and a favourite for most regulars in this joint.

P.S.The reason for mentioning the prices against each item is to reinforce the point that good food can still be served at pretty reasonable prices even in today's age of high inflation. 
Cheers!!!

A person who has been to Park Street MUST have entered Peter Cat at least once. Pleasant interiors, extremely cooperative staff and superb food -  what else does a foodie want?

The well-known Chelo Kabab - the "beautiful" platter of kebabs with rice, is good and definitely worth trying out. 
But the best dish has to be the Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler. The waiter himself recommended it to me, and thumbs up! It is amazing. The succulent pieces of mutton, chicken, liver, shrimp and fish together are heaven for the tastebuds. Prices are very reasonable - approximately Rs.600 for two (without alcohol).

One drawback is the huge crowd that gathers outside, making you wait for a few minutes before you can get an empty table. Once you indulge in your food, a smile on your face is guaranteed.

Love the food. Especially the non veg sizzler mainly as I get a lot of variety. Its well priced & good enough for dinner/lunch either of the meals. However the ambience can be improved. The seating areas hardly allow privacy & service is pretty descent. Its ideal for weekend family dine! Ps: Its cheap!

We were a party of around 20 from three generation in our family waiting for entrance for nearly an hour. When we were finally allowed in, it was in batches of 6 to 8. So we were in but could'nt order till all came. Then it took nearly 30 mins for the starters to arrive and immediately then the waiters asked us to order main course. 
the food was worth the wait. we had prawn cocktail, fish makhmali, mutton sheek kebab, chicken irani kebab and fresh lime soda. in main course we had chicken sizzler, Fish Masala with Pulao, and CELLO KABAB. JUST AWESOME. We finished off with TootiFrooti.
I would never ever go in a big group and with restless people to PeterCat.

The food was so below ordinary, and the worst is the attitude these guys who run the place have. In this age of prompt an courteous service I don't know why ppl go to such a horrible place. Freaking Waste.

Loved this restaurant since my childhood days. Even now whenever we are planning to eat out or go to Park Street, selection starts by wondering if we will get sitting space quickly in Peter Cat. Located at the corner of Music World. Waiting area is ample and partly covered. Restaurant exists in 3 parts - ground floor upon entering , accommodating both Families and Couples; Back side of ground floor mostly for stags or drinking groups; and 1st floor for families and bigger groups (generally). Food is great and they have an unique taste maintained for years . Service is courteous and even though they are the rockstars of Park Street,  they don't give you an attitude.  

Favourites include Chelo Kabab, Prawn Cocktail, Sizzlers and many more. 
Price range of food is most affordable and economic. You can have couple dinner within INR 600. Easy car parking space nearby. 

Cons : Not many,  but personally I like toilets less cramped. They have just one that too not big.

The food is really good for time immemorial. Chelo-Kebab, Dum-ki-Raan are must haves. Add to it their special sizzlers. But the service has deteriorated over a period of time or was it always like this (only historians can answer). I'm visiting Peter-Cat for the last 11 years, & this is from my personal experience. The ambiance is old world, charming. Not swanky or suave. Good old Park Street kind. Thumps up for the food. Cheers!

Have mostly visited with friends and family. 

The kebabs will melt in your mouth. The chelo kebab is heavy and awesome.
Sizzlers are mind blowing, specially the mixed grilled sizzler.

 For desserts try the almond mousse and mixed fruit sundae.
service is good, the waiters are attentive. 

The cocktails are mind blowing, i particularly loved the Screwdriver.

Though Quality has deteriorated over the last few years. But good place to hang out.

LOCATION : If you Reach Music World You're there ! 

No matter how many times you eat here , you'll never ever get sick of it. Such is the pleasure of eating here.Ordered the Chelo Kabab platter but this time with Biriyani-Ala-Nawabi with a Strawberry Milkshake.The platter never disappoints.The rice,butter,egg with the kebabs is such a wholesome meal in itself. But the highlight of my evening was the Biriyani absolutely.I believe this is the only Biriyani that can rival Arsalan's Biriyani.The aroma and taste was a such a welcome difference. The quantity was overwhelming.The milkshake was good but not the best that i've had in this price range.  

AMBIANCE : This place is like the epitome of elegance and Taste. The lights with the red hues blend so well. The staff are all quite old but they are very well mannered and well dressed.My ideal place is the second table on the left hand side of the first floor.

FINAL CONCLUSION : From the moment you start eating you'll know why this place is so famous ! If you are a regular customer, you know what i'm talking about,but if you are a newcomer do try the Chelo   Kabab (An absolute Delight). This is their signature dish and for good reason. Once you eat here you're bound to get addicted. The menu is just so happening with plenty of items to choose from.The place may not be cheap but you'll never find a place better than this one to drop about 1000/- on food .Cost for 2 : 900/-. Satisfaction Guranteed.

Being one of the oldest restaurants in the city of joy, I feel it has one of the most loyal customer base. As a result you will never find the place empty. Excellent interiors and soulful lighting makes the place very attractive. But finally, what matters is the food and I must say its good. Theres a delicacy called Chelo Kabab and I feel this place is the most famous endorser of this dish. its a must have and an absolute delicacy in its true sense. The place is also famous for its sizzlers and they are a delight as well. The main point is if you have any of these two dishes for main course theres hardly any more space left to eat. I ll say that the starters are good as well. In all a great place for a foodie.

Not much to add about this place that's not already been said by others. The place is always teeming with people, offers a very warm table ambience, provides arguably the city's best kebab platters (especially the chello kebab) and and all-in-all, an undeniably great dining experience. Maybe just slightly on the expensive side,  but the quality of the time spent makes up for it.

i have been visiting this particular restaurant since time immemorial,i guess..Peter Cat is a place where you can always expect good service and excellent food. It is very popular, which can be vouched for by the queues which are there on all days of the week!Start with starters, followed by "Chello Kebab" and sum up with hot chocolate ice-cream. A must have sizzler & chello kebab (national dish of Iran).Yes that is what it is - Chello Kebab...Chello Kebab...Chello Kebab.I don't think i need to vouch for this famous restaurant from the city of joy..writing the review is somewhat paying a tribute to the CK...:)

Peter cat....aah, definitely among my favourites in the city. Go there, have a meal with your friends and family and you'll have to go back and visit again and again and again.....

Whatever i've tried here turned out good, but try the chelo kebab and sizzlers for sure, with your favourite drink. That will make your day. There are lot more, ask the waiters they will guide you. Apart from the food, ambience is good and so is service. If you are a tourist, this is a must visit. (So is Mocambo, just across the street)

Keep in mind that price is on the higher side and go early in the evening, else you'll have to wait in the queue.

The only place in the City,where you could never doubt either the impeccable service or the quality of the food that one would be served. 
I count Peter Cat to be the Ultimate gastronomic destination if you are on a budget but at the same time want a 4-star lunch/dinner. 
The Chelo Kebab : Needs no introduction. The Universal Favourite. The Universal Reccomendation.
I have one quirky suggestion though. If you have kids with you and they are fussy eaters,you could try out their French Fries. I call them Potato Wedges as opposed to Fries because not only they are juiciest that you will find any where in Calcutta but the most deliciously tender inside and the just rightly crisped outside. 
One of the desserts I generally like to end my meals with is the Hot Brownie with Vanilla Icecream and Hot Chocolate Sauce. That's an orgasm right there for your tastebuds. 
Apart from my favourites here,there is always their famous Sizzlers,of which the Tandoori House Special ranks #1 on my list.
From the Indian section,Mutton Rogan Josh paired with Butter Naan rocks too. 
Indulge Away!

We ordered for Fish Makhmali in starters which was so lip smacking I still can't forget its taste., Chello Kebab which doesnt need any review I guess but souffle i a must try for dessert one of the best souffle I found out in this town, though service was a bit sloppy

First trip to Calcutta and no time to explore the city (courtesy a friends wedding)... so we only managed to try out this highly recommended age-old joint.. it was completely packed on a Monday afternoon with about 5-10 minutes waiting time as well..

This place has a very "night-time" feeling attached to it.. extremely dim lighting with ceiling lamps hanging down all the way to the tables and slightly cramped up seating space..

The cuisine served here is Continental and Indian .. but most people seemed to be going for the Continental.. 

We tried the House special chicken steak, Roast chicken sizzler, and vegetable chelo kabab (the speciality of this restaurant).
The food was of above average taste, however, there were a few disappointments:
1. The roast chicken and the chicken steak tasted pretty much the same
2. The great part about the chelo kabab was the veg kabab, the paneer and potato were not up to the mark (but then again, I feel this dish is popular for its chicken version )

Considering the amount I have heard about Calcutta food all my life, I would not say this experience matched my expectations..

The most interesting thing though, is their drinks menu, with innovative names and even more creative and humorous pictures to go along with the names, it was definitely intriguing.. If i ever land up in Calcutta again.. I would definitely give this place (and especially the drinks) a try at nighttime!!

The phenomenon of peter cat can well be compared to that of Victoria memorial or a Tata Centre. Have been going there since 1988. The earliest memories of dinning out begins with peter cat.My last visit in April 2013 which was after a time period of a year and a half. To my utter surprise I noticed the deterioration in service as well as the food quality.The cream of chicken soup served was cold,the seekh kababs served with their famous Chello Kababs tasted more of gram flour than chicken and also the chicken rashmi butter masala had a strong flavour of uncooked spices.I have had these items on innumerable occasion that the original taste is always at the back of your mind. The mgt should from time to time poke their nose in the service and food quality.

peter cat gas been a favourite of all calcuttans for a long time. One of the most popular joints on park street. Its most famous for its sumptuous chello kebab, which is buttered rise served with kebab. Its simple yet delicious. The feel of the place is very warm and cozy. Though on a busy day is bizzing with people and sometimes gets hard to hear yourself. You dont mind it due to the food.My favourite thing on the menu is its chicken steak sizzler. Their sizzlers make them legendary, like their mats say. You will not get this kind of sizzler anywhere else ans that s guarantee. Its just chicken with potatoes,a omelett and boiled vegetables on a sizzling plate on cabbage. No additional noodles or rice which is served with sizzlers in any other place. You have to just have to go to peter cat whenever in calcutta!

Visiting Kolkata for the first time, I had to visit Peter Cat for sure. This was the most talked about restaurants in town besides Mocambo, which apparently is by the same owner as this one. 

The reviews I read before walking in had already decided my order. So Chelo Kebabs and the Grilled chicken sizzler it was. Before I come to that, the waiting at the entrance was a bit of a let down. I would not have waited for 30 minutes on the street, if this wasnt one of the must-eat places in Kokata and if I wasn't a tourist. Plus, they have a pretty unorganized way of handling waiting customers. There is a suited guy standing at the entrance who just writes names (and number or people you need the table for) on a piece of paper, in a manner/order that only he can possibly understand. He then calls out names randomly, not necessarily on a first come first serve basis. We saw 2-3 groups who arrived after us, almost the same number of people as us, walk in before us while we continued to wait. And no, they had not made a prior reservation. The restaurant doesn't accept that, apparently.  

Moving on, the interiors are pretty average. Although i loved the dark and dimly lit setting, the restaurant does kind of give the impression of a very old restaurant. But that doesn't bother you. Its nice and well air conditioned (a pre-requisite, in humid Kolkata). 

What made me really happy was the variety of beer that they had on the menu, and all of it was available, including a beer brewed in Sikkim called Dansberg. While the restaurant had already earned half the brownie points from me with this, the rest of them were earned when the beer arrived. They serve their beer in metallic mugs (brass or something, i think) which have the name of the restaurant (Peter Cat) engraved on them. For me this was the effing deal maker. Loved it! I had already made up my mind by then that I was not gonna care how the food tasted. 

Coming to the food, honestly, the chello kebabs and the sizzler were nothing great. I mean, no offense, but it was nothing more than two mutton seekhs, a little rice, 1 egg and some chicken tikkas by the side! And those didn't taste too good either. Probably Kolkata lacks better Indian food options, for kebabs etc., which is what makes the people love it, but then again, maybe I was expecting too much out of them. 

All in all, besides the waiting period, the place is great. The service is quick, servers know their stuff and the variety is nice! Also, this one is a bit of a general Kolkata thing, but the restaurant is very well priced! Being used to Delhi/NCR prices, the menu comes off as a bit of a pleasant surprise. 

Although, if you are out and have time just for one lunch, I would recommend Mocambo over Peter Cat, just across the street for better tasting food and nice cocktails.

Peter cat has been one of Kolkata's most popular restaurants since the 1960's. This place has red interiors with comfortable seating creating a dimly lit ambiance. The servers are dressed in traditional crisp white sherwanis with red turbans. The restaurant gets its name from a certain famous cat who lived in the Lords cricket ground sometime around 1960's. Yes, I am in love with everything about the restaurant. The food is great value for money. The cocktails here are cheaper than main course.The unique menu card is in the shape of a cat's head. 

Suggestion: They are so famous in Kolkata and infact all over India, that if they made a mascot of the peter cat, and sold merchandise, it would sell like their chelo kebab! 

You must have guessed that the chelo kebabs tops the list on their menu. Two minced mutton kebabs and one chicken sheek, served with buttered rice topped with an egg is a delight for the people of Kolkata. Prawn cocktail is my personal favourite. The sauce is tangy, perfectly creamy, with hint of tabasco and medium sized fresh steamed prawns, garnished with lime and herbs. They have a special starter menu which is served with drinks! The chicken tikka kebab and fish makhmali kebab would be my favourite. Soft, succulent well marinated pieces of meat and fish, the aroma of charcoal and tandoor make it a very appetising starter. Peter cat is known for its sizzlers. The mutton hamburger steak and the tandoori mixed grill are highly recommended. Most of their sizzlers are served with grilled vegetables or potato mash. You could get your steak, well done or medium grilled. The have options in sauces, best among them would be pepper, mushroom and bbq sauce. For a sweet ending to your meal, you could go for the banana split or a chocolate shake, or a warm brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The latter has been on their menu since its inception and completes the whole Peter Cat experience. 

My experience at this place has always been great. The cons, that one may add is slow service often due to the heavy crowd. Also, they don't take reservations on occasions which is when you see a line almost upto Bistro by the park.That wasn't a bad experience either coz that is how I ended up eating at Bistro one time. Anyway, that experience is for a separate review.

Overall rating : 4.5
Pocket pinch for two: Rs 1200 (without alcohol)

Chello Kebabs are fantastic. Though prices have increased and quantity decreased over the years but the taste remains the same. Only for having my chello kebabs that I visit this place.
Decor is nice, with an air of exquisiteness to it. Sizzlers are a huge hit too, but according to me, the chello-kebabs are way better.

Food: 4.5/5

I seriously donno whether to write a review here, #210. Nevertheless, currently being in Chennai and missing Kolkata a bit too much now, shall dedicate one to Peter Cat !The first thing about the place, its name. I am a very feline human and hence absolutely in love with anything saying 'cat'. The second thing is Park Street. And the third one being that hour-long wait to get in. You enroll yourself, wait, blah-blah with whoever is accompanying you or with others waiting outside, take a walk around the area or explore the Music World store right beside. And then finally, its your chance and with an immense sense of joyous victory over the others, you get in :)Talking of the food its sincerely worth the wait. I have always had the Chelo Kabab platter there and that is what Peter Cat is (probably) most known for. Be it those cubes of melting butter on the rice grains or the kebabs or the poach or that slice of tomato on the side, everything seems perfect ! FYI, the food comes relatively quick for the waiting time outside and you might find the service a 'little' lagging but i guess thats okay given the rush.

Visited Peter Cat y'day evening on a spontaneous plan with colleagues .. and got lucky enough to be seated really, really fast.. must say that the food is getting better with years!! Year 2015 has been the year of chelo kebabs :P

Peter Cat brings back fond memories of by-gone days. Those times when Park Street was the only place where you could imagine taking your family to eat out. The "Chelo Kebab" and the cream of tomato has been and will be an all-time favorite of mine. Try out their Fish Fingers, Chicken Pakoda, Fish Makhmali and the mean steaks. Their "Aphrodisiacs for the Harem" are unparalleled so as their Rogan Josh.

Hi, am from Surrey, England.. Recently been to this place, the quality of the food was good but i do have a complain about their service...the manager on duty was rude and they made us wait for 15 mins to even get a menu and when we asked for a change of seat they rudely replied that it was not possible, I have been there before and the service was good and so was the food ...  actually planned a family get together there, but this time the service was so disappointing but the food was good

The best place for sizzlers and chelo kababs and sizzlers in town. 
Have mostly visited with friends and family. The cocktails are mind blowing, i particularly loved Bachelors desire, and also the Screwdriver.
The kababs will melt in your mouth. The chelo kabab is heavy and awesome.
Sizzlers are mind blowing, specially the mixed grilled sizzler. Grilled fish was tasty and melted inside the mouth. For desserts try the almond mousse and mixed fruit sundae.
service is good, the waiters are attentive. 
Quality has deteriorated over the last few years though. But good place to hang out.

P.S. - Parking is a pain. Peak hours are particularly crowded. Pre-booking recommended.

Highly over rated. Peter Cat is one confused restaurant. What does it serve? Indian? Continental? Chinese? Middle eastern? 
I was very hungry and yes I had very little time too, I tried Makhmali Fish and Chicken Sizzler.....I found Makhmali Fish very tender and very tasty to eat.
Compared to all other resturant in that place it may not be the best but still when hungry you can try it out.
With few friends around the corner and during the party time u can check in and have some fun time with all ur buddies.

Went there with my didi and cousin brother. The ambience is quite good. But I found out that beer was not available in regular 650ml bottles but instead they served pint. It costs more. More disappointed i was to see the beer glasses. Never before I had seen steel glasses for beer. The food was ok. We ordered Chelo kebab. But to my disappointment I found that it was not quite the hype it created all around. I mean it was nothing extraordinary about it. To me it plainly seemed to be a good name given to a assorted type of kababs. The rest of the food was quite good. The service was fast. I was not entirely satisfied with this restaurant.

Surely among the best restaurants in the city. After visiting many a times I still cant find what bad to tell about this place......The food is awesome,ambiance is classy with a touch of European designing....The Best dishes are  definitely the Sizzing Hot C.Sizzlers combination of chicken breast, vegetables and egg, flavored with sauce. I found their service efficient and prompt. But, what attracted my attention was the cute cat's head on the menu card....Another great dish is the Chelo kebab-.a sumptuous dish of buttered rice served hot with tomatoes, poached egg, mutton dumplings and mutton kebabs. Visit the place for excellent fooodie experience.
         After visiting once you will surely give it another try,well most people do :p  :-) :-).

I had a high thought about it. Hence I guided one my v. spl guest for lunch. We were total 8. At the door they made us stand for 20min. Then announced the vacancy for 8. No issue. unfortunetly 2 of my friends were late for few minute as they were looking for a parking. We 6 were not allowed as just all 8 are not togather. My guest even stepped in 7 he was asked to wait again untill all heads are present. I was no where.

Food - This place hosts the best chelo kebab. I have tried all the sizzlers, they are best in the city. I like the uniqueness they serve beer in a bronze beer mugs with a mixture.

Some twenty years back my parents took me to this restaurant, we had Chelo Kebab....and thus, history was written!..It shaped my perception about good food for once and all! Don't blame me for being so dramatic. Their food is to blame!.. Be it their sizzling sizzlers, the mouth-watering starters, the purely awesome Prawn cocktail, the other-worldly Chelo Kebab or even the humble sounding mutter paneer.. these guys seriously understand food!..The only thing I hate is..waiting on the other side of the door while people inside are having their share of the Peter Cat Magic!..I have recommended this place to everyone I have met, thought I would share the same here! :) :)

How on Earth do you review something so special??? How do you review that name which makes you hungry even after a meal? How do you refrain yourself from falling in love with this place?
The negatives first. The decor has not changed, but then does it need to if it is that much good?
The waiting, but then it is expected if you go to the most renowned restaurant in town.
The time taken to serve, but what can you do if there are so many people waiting for food. The prices, OK I agree it is high but then that's park street and probably the most selling restaurant on it. How do you match demand with supply without a high price.
The place is just awesome. The food is so good.
Try out the cold chicken and salad, the fried chicken liver and the Irani Kebab and try it along with the gentle murderer or some other cocktail.
Try out Fish Makhmali.
If you must go outside and away from the most ordered then have some Kabuli Nan along with Harem's Joy or Shah Nauz. I have as such never had biryani out here so cannot suggest on that.
Next moving on to the Continental Section from Chef's Seafood Specialties try out the Becktys, any of them .
Finally from what sells best out there the Sizzlers or the Chelo Kebabs. The Sizzlers are just awesome and House special is a must try. You can also try Chicken Steak or Grilled Chicken and you can also for a change try the Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler it is of course a Tandoori style sizzler but again very good.
To wind up have either a Tutti Frutti or the Peter Cat special though I love their mango souffle.
Go there and enjoy some good dining in terms of food and old charm decor but then the waiters may not be that much courteous so that is something sad and only the only reason that they do not get more marks on my review. Every other thing can be accepted considering the crowd but you need the mindful attention of the waiters.

Ahhh.....!!! Peter Cat!!!! Ahhhhhhhh..... Undoubtedly one of the best reasons to feel proud to be a Kolkatan. I cannot really give a complete review of this restaurant as my orders here had always been Chello Kebab and Chilled Beer. 
Two of three things to be cautious in Peter Cat and let me tell you those:
1. Avoid weekends and lunch time in weekdays. Hardly you get a sit and you might have to wait for more than an hour outside. 
2. For parking... it is nightmare. As such parking in Park Street is tough but for parking it in front of Peter Cat is almost impossible. So better you park your car at Russel Street and go there walking. 
3. If you are looking for the best of services, please avoid Peter Cat. You will not feel obliged for having them serve you but definitely not the best place to get the best service. 
4. Even if you reserve the place, you will find it difficult to get a place. On weekends they do not accept reservations. 

By the way, I remember had some other Kebab here but could not recollect that well as there was nothing special about it. But the Chello Kebab is just awesome. Have it and I am sure you will also feel the same....

Peter Cat, a renowned restaurant in Kolkata is a foodie's haven. You can dig into mouthwatering Continental and North Indian cuisines without emptying your pockets. Rush to this place if you are ravenously hungry, and when your taste buds crave for juicy meat, seasoned with herbs and spices! What makes Peter Cat famous among people is their succulent Chelo Kebabs, a sumptuous dish of buttered rice served hot with tomatoes, poached egg, mutton dumplings and mutton kebabs. Delicious and nutritious, this dish is enough to satiate your hunger anytime. I heard a lot about Peter Cat's chelo kebabs from my relatives and friends. This is one reason why I decided to have my lunch there one fine afternoon.
On entering the restaurant, I was greeted with friendly and courteous waiters, dressed immaculately in their uniforms. There was no need to check their menu card because I was sitting at Peter Cat to taste their lip smacking Chelo Kebabs. After about 30 minutes of placing my order, the dish arrived, piping hot emitting a delicious aroma. The tantalizing smell of the spicy kebabs seasoned with the melted butter was just too appetizing. I didn't wait a single minute and started gorging on the delicious chelo kebabs the moment they were laid on the table. 
Their Chelo kebabs are reasonably priced and it's a filling dish. Unless you are a gourmand, I'm sure you can't eat anything else after you've finished a plateful of chelo kebabs. You can also complete your chelo kebabs with their tasty pineapple blossom or a pint of beer. The choice is yours! Apart from chelo kebabs, Peter Cat is also famous for their delectable sizzlers. You can try their chicken sizzler, a perfect combination of chicken breast, vegetables and egg, flavored with sauce. I found their service efficient and prompt. But, what attracted my attention was the cute cat's head on the menu card and the funny quotes on their cocktail menu.
I'm sure I'll come back here again, but this time with family and friends if I can get a table free that is!

Located in the heart of city,Peter Cat is one of the most crowded restuarants in town!Honestly i have no idea what makes sooo many Calcuttans drag themselves here!!been there a few times the food here seems just average to me, i mean nothing so extraordinary though the desserts are good! Neither is the ambience that good nor is the service or staff! ya..one thing i will agree that they do serve good sizzlers! but being a vegetarian i don't really find the food that delicious!super oily and feels like they add all spices they find in their kitchen! plus i don't think their food is all that good in quality too...a few plus points of this place are that it has a lot of capacity (itz spacious) plus the pricing is very nominal!! but still i can give nothing more than 2.5 to this place and would'nt really recommend this place!!

On the up side , the food is great , the ambience is good but the service is ok-ok. If you are into kebabs, you must try the "chelo kebab" . Its a standout dish among others in the menu. Another delicious dish is the House special sizzler.

On the down side ,if you are a foodie by choice and don't pre-plan your restraunt visits , you might have to wait atleast 45 mins - 1 hr for table confirmation.  for a planned visit , its better to book a table beforehand.

There has been some bitter experiences in Peter Cat..the very fact that they have a bad waiters who have no proper training to treat customers.

Having said that, i must admit that the food here is good.. if you are a fan of sizzlers..you can comfortably step inside and order one..the second best which i am sure we all would love to have is Chello Kabab...try this one if you wanna come here for lunch or dinner..its really good...
Prices are quite average which is good..

Once upon a time, there used to be a famous restaurant glorifying Park Street called Peter Cat. Alas, after decades of brilliant service - the once famous Peter Cat is now just another mediocre food joint amongst the many in the city.

The service, which used to be brilliant, is now sloppy.
The food, which used to be exquisite, is now run of the mill.
The ambience, which used to be unique, is now a cackle of plates and cutlery and loud voices.

Where has our Peter Cat gone?

Ordering a Chello Kabab has become a nightmare. Though the food is passably good, it is nowhere near the standard that Peter Cat used to order. At a time when Saturday night family dinner meant only Peter Cat, now - the restaurants adjacent to it are doing better. 

Prawn Cocktail. Biriyani. The second time around. Precious little had changed. 
I wish i wrote this review 2 years back. It would have been glowing with a 4.5 rating.

But FINAL VERDICT - If Peter Cat doesn't pick up the pace and doesn't revert back to what it originally was, then customers will slowly start filtering away. You can give this place a try. The old school feel definitely remains. And if you're lucky, you'll get good food on time. Here's wishing adieu to the old Peter Cat and a hopeful feeling that it resurfaces soon.

The antagonizing wait for a table on a weekday built up my appetite and expectations. And I was thoroughly let down. Service was rushed and the black coat captains were not particularly courteous. In fact the guy manning the entrance with the waiting list was downright rude and arrogant. I inquired as to why the aloo chat and pineapple and cheese canopies were tagged as non vegetarian and got a cheeky response that milk products like cheese and paneer are non vegan and therefore non veg???? Anyways ordered the famous chello kebabs and was left wondering what the fuss was about. Maybe the meal has a novelty value for first timers but I don't see anything particularly noteworthy about the dish. The meal was not really something to rave about. The butter masala prawns were just about ok. A complete letdown.

Rarely do I write a bad review about a place unless the food/service is atrocious. However, this time I am sort of forced to do so based on two separate occasions where I went there with people. The first time this happened was about a month back, when I had gone there with a group of four people, and one of them found a hair on his hamburger steak. We told the manager, who came in after ten minutes and gave a half-hearted apology, and took it away. The second time the plate was put in front of him, the meat was charred so bad that it was bitter. When we complained about this, the manager told us that this was the way the Hamburger was done, discounting the fact that we were not strangers to Peter Cat, and we have eaten there many times previously. 

The last time I went inside Peter Cat, I stood outside for 40 minutes before a table was empty. Given the fact that it was a Saturday night, I could understand the rush, and I waited patiently. I went in with my friend and we ordered our usual - Chelo Kabab and a diet coke. We generally eat this whenever we go, and its the standard for us. The food came after 20 minutes, with the drink, and during this time, we were not even given a glass of water. When the chelo kabab came, it was cold. The rice was stone cold, and the butter sat unappetizingly cold over it, cut in chunks. The egg was very cold and I nearly gagged. My partner complained of the same. I decided to abandon them, and eat only the kababs which were semi-edible. 

When the bill came, we realized that we have been charged not only for the chelo kabab but also for tandoori prawns and three diet cokes (we had ordered only one). We argued with the manager, and after 10 minutes, a revised bill was brought in for us. 

So Peter Cat is not a good place for me right now. They should be more attentive.

The Good Ol' Chello!
Ambience: With small focus lightings on each table the place, on entering may seem a little dark but believe you me, it is more personal that way. And for those who grew up with Peter Cat, this is a place of nostalgia (and good food, of course!)
Service: The service is good as there are plenty of staff to handle even the nastiest weekend rush (I, personally, did not face any issue with their service till date).
Food: For this foodie and many others, Peter Cat stands for one thing and one thing only...the Chello Kebab. Six pieces of juiciest chicken reshmi kebabs and two pieces of delicately spiced mutton shikh kebabs served on a bed of mildly buttered rice and topped with a sunny-side up egg and butter, is a true delight! Though on their coasters they claim fame for their sizzlers, but this foodie is sorry to report that he may be biased towards the Chello...
Recommendations: The Chello Kebab, of course. But you can go ahead and try the sizzlers and steaks on offer. And a special mention in the desserts section, Brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce! The reason? They actually care to make their own hot chocolate sauce with Cadbury's Cocoa powder (instead of the common practice of using Hershey's Chocolate syrup) which makes the sauce thicker, more chocolatey and thus, infinitely better! And they serve the hot chocolate sauce separately in a bowl to be poured over the brownie by myself makes me go weak at the knees...yummmm!

Peter Cat is one of the most popular restaurants in the city, and the long queue at the entrance proves it. Chello Kebab is a must try, and is surely the best dish among the ones I tried here. Its a complete meal, though the rice may not be sufficient for some people. Another popular dish is Chicken Steak (sizzler) which I found to be nothing special. You can also try Baked Chicken with dinner rolls (if you have already tried chello kebab, and not liked it). 

You won't find the waiters polite, but the service is quick. Ambiance is good, a little dark yet cozy. 

Peter cat makes the best Chello Kebabs, but I found nothing else here worthy of its popularity.

I don't think it needs a review bcoz it's almost a brand, but still for the sake of writing something, I will simply request the readers to have 'house special sizzler' at least once. It's expensive, but it's worth every penny. 

Pros : Nice ambiance, decent delivery time, sizzlers and some kababs

Cons: Long queues, car parking problem, a bit expensive

Located in Stephen Court Park Street just opposite to KFC, this is a restaurant which never is short of a queue by foodies. Lovely ambience with dim lights and superb service, this place is absolutely a foodie's delight . The speciality which makes this restaurant unique for a long time is its variety of 'Chelo Kababs' . 

Try it out, but be aware to face a long. queue. Peter Cat rocks!

This place makes me feel nostalgic every time I come here. The famous & traditional Chelo kebab is considered to be the signature dish of this place. The piping hot Sizzlers are awesome too. I personally enjoy the ambience, the history, the food, the feel, the warmth and the shabbiness too. Tiffany light shades, dark woodwork, carpets, crockery, cutlery, the metal beer mugs, waiters in old-style uniforms give this place a quietly pleasant and uniquely relaxing feel. Will be back very soon.

One of the best restaurents in the city. best known for its CHELLO KEBABS. The ambience is nice, serving  time is excellent. Chello Kebab is a must try for new comers. i had also tried the chicken sizzlers and other continental dishes which are very tasty and well prepared. Other kebab dishes are good (but not best.. the best here is the chello kebabs ). Lunch time at weekends are very congested and one may have wait for long specially for the larger groups (>4).

I finally got my hands on the famous Chelo Kebab, and boy is it to die for! I have been hearing of this place way too much to wait to dine there.

I must say, from it's name and fame, the ambience is quite different. It's got a cozy, somewhat Mughlai feeling to it, which actually with the lights bright on, ain't too big a deal. Admit it! But nevertheless, it's comforting and pleasant. This point, however, might be not true for many but I personally found the interiors a little too dim for a restaurant. In fact, the light from above covers only the center part of the table. Once you're seated around a table, it's a little difficult to make out faces and in a way straining to look at your plate, the part where the light doesn't fall. Definitely not a place to take photos of you and your friends enjoying your scrumptious meals. It might not be a very bad idea if the tables, individually as it is now, were a little more intensely and widely lit.

Service on the other hand, is delightful. Prompt and very friendly people keep you cheerful while serving you good food.

Last but most importantly, the food. Chelo Kebab definitely lived, lives and will always live up to it's reputation, hopefully. Saying anything about it will be dishonoring because, the two kinds of kebabs and the butter rice together, it's heaven on a plate. Having said that, there is however another similar combo at Chawla's which I would highly recommend to Kebab lovers. Chilly Babycorn was chilly and charming, tasty just right. I tried the Chicken Steak Sizzler too which was, well alright. The chicken part was delicious, period! But veggies on the side were overcooked, soggy and not too appetizing. I am one of those who strictly hate leaving food on the plate, but unfortunately I had to leave some of those veggies behind. I anyways just got to say this, I have had better Chicken Steaks at Scoop.

It was all in all, a lovely first time experience at Peter Cat's until toward the end where I had the most spine chilling restaurant experience in my whole life! Took me completely by surprise and shook me down to the core! We had just finished our food and drinks and I headed to the ladies room to clean up. If you notice, there is a whole right under the tap in every wash basin which stops it from flooding. So, I was washing my hands when I noticed the area inside that whole was waterlogged and SOMETHING MOVED. I stopped the tap to check and found a couple of worms swimming about!

The restaurant is deeply loved by the people and has always lived upto it's reputation for decades and will do the same for many more decades to come. I'm sure this was a one time thing, just a little attention and inspection here and there is all that is needed. I sincerely request the management to look it up. Once I have come out of that eerie feeling I'm sure to visit this place many a more times.

Location: Very easy to find. Near music World.
Food and Service:  I had gone there to see for myself why so many people are praising chicken sizzlers and chello kabab. The kabab was way beyond my expectations. it was very tasty and cooked perfectly. Since then I have been an ardent lover of burnt food and no other place has met my expectations yet. The disappointment was chicken sizzlers. it had too many eggs in it and too many potatoes instead of the chicken. The waiter was an old man who was polite and rushed to us whenever we needed. A complete package restaurant.

Conclusion: I would recommend all to visit this place. its not too pricy and one of the oldest brand in kolkata. And one of the very best. try the chello kabab atleast once in your life. It must be special as Rahul Gandhi has eaten here. And me too :p

Even though I grew up going to this restaurant I can't just help but order the Chello Kebabs, yes they are that good. It is comfort food in a comforting decor. Let me be clear about the comforting decor, it is comforting for those who have long been associated with the place but many might find it a tad old-fashioned due to dimly lighted decor but I hope they never change it. The basmati rice is cooked perfectly and with each long grain of rice separate and the aroma inviting. The blob of butter which melts to half its amount by the time the dish reaches one's table is a handsome amount. The kebabs are nicely done and the fried egg completes a hearty meal.

Review #2 - This time had Chicken Steak Sizzler and it was served smoking hot and its delicious, may not be the best in town, but was good enough. Also had the known Chelo Kebab Original and I love the Chicken Kebabs very much served along with it. Also I was very happy with their service this time. The best part of the food is that its not too spicy and you will enjoy every bit of the flavour. Next time will try some other available dishes...

Went dere to have the signature dish - CHELO KEBAB...
I may not appreciate their service & ambiance but I must admit dat CHELO KEBAB was great. A must try for everyone.

If a name is ubiquitous with the ideas of dining out at Park Street and has been so for the last few decades, there is a reason for it. Peter Cat has been, and will be, for years to come, a landmark in the history of fine dining in Calcutta.

Peter Cat needs no introduction, in fact it is a reference point: you will often find people referring to other restaurants - KFC just opposite Peter Cat, or the Music World just beside it.

The moment you step inside (if you do not have a reservation during the heavy lunch hours or dinner times, chances are you will have to wait for 15 to 20 minutes - but it's totally worth it), you will be transported into another era. The royally dressed self-styled men as Pathans will welcome you into the elegant house. There are two sections - you may choose the upper floor, in terms of quality of service both are equal, but the ambience is a matter of personal choice.

Seated into the plush chairs or sofas, you now hold in your hands a gateway to a marvelous world of delicacies. At this point I would like to include, on a personal note: it is best to come here in a large group, so that you can delve into a lot of their items without having to waste any and sharing some of each.

Start off with the Prawn Cocktail - the best in Kolkata, without doubt, and Dum Ki Raan for starters - lamb leg pieces cooked to perfection on slow heat, soft succulent pieces. Try out the Minnestrone - an Italian delicacy or the Cream of hicken with Asparagus.

For the main course, first go for the Chicken Marrakesh - as a sort of trailer for the brilliance to come. The sizzlers are fantastic too, be it the Chef's Choice or the House Special or the Tandoori Mixed Grill.

The crowning glory of this place is undoubtedly the Chelow (spelled Chello here) Kebab. This brilliant Persian dish is the national dish of Iran, and Peter Cat's recipe for it is, according to their menu card, a protected regional product of West Bengal. It comes with saffroned basmati rice with a dollop of sinful butter, three kebabs and a grilled tomato served with eggs.This is the best selling dish of this restaurant, and one of the best items Calcutta cuisine has to offer. It tastes best with Doogh, a Persian drink, but this is not served at Peter Cat. You might as well go with any other beverage of your choice as long as it does not interfere with the flavour of the dish. It has a delicate, evenly balanced texture, and Peter Cat takes every step possible to ensure that it stays on top of all copycats who have tried to duplicate their recipe; and you can be rest assured that they do it exceedingly well.

Wrap up your meal with a Peter Cat Special Ice Cream.

Stick to the best of what they have to offer, and they will serve you will. However, this is not a place to experiment with dishes like overpriced naans or biriyanis that do not live up to expectations.

Peter Cat is as synonymous with the Chello Kebab as Shah Jahan with the Taj Mahal. And what the Taj Mahal is for a visual treat, Peter Cat's Chello is no less for your gastronomic experience.

Go ahead and try it!

I was at Peter Cat last week on Friday evening and luckily did not have to wait for long before called out.
The Indian food variety was really good and I would go back for it more than once for sure.
However, the sizzlers, which probably was the peak order of the evening while we were there(almost every table ordering one) was dissapointing. I have definitely had better sizzlers at places far less renowned restaurants. The chicken in the sizzler tasted like some chinese food and the chicken was definitely dry.
Service was prompt and good.

I had only one evening in Calcutta. Post asking all friends and family, I chose to go eat a meal at Peter Cat. After patiently waiting for 20 mins ( I was told that patience would be required as there is ALWAYS waiting) I got myself a seat. Pleased as punch, I ordered the veg chelo Kebab. 
When it came, it looked appetizing and smelt good. One piece of tikka into mouth made me realise that the food was not even warm. I asked the waiter to please get me hot food. 10 mins later, the tikka was heated and the rest stone cold!
Armed with a resolute promise of NOT ruining my evening, I called the head waiter who whisked away my plate and got me new stuff. 
The aloo tikka was dry ( too much heating??), the chemo kebabs just did not cut the grade, the paneer I had honestly lost interest in!
After the rave reviews and much ado - it was NOT a pleasant experience. Can't help but wonder what the hype is about.

I don't remember but they also serve a Kebab plate called Shikaar, I'm not sure about the pronunciation/spelling but it was amazing.

Peter Cat has no Peter and definitely no cat. It has a Mughal British feel to it. Dim lighting and cosy table/chairs. Not a very family place. It's a place where you relax with friends or take someone out on a date. Enjoy a pint of beer or two. 
I have been to Peter Cat only once. Getting a table is terribly difficult. But I love the unique name and its unique food and try my luck every time I am in that area for dinner.
Needless to say Chaelo Kebab (platter with sauteed rice/veg.s/kebab) is synonymous with Peter Cat. While you are trying the Chaelo Kebab (which everyone does) do try the vegetable gratin as well! It's delicious and creamy with a layer of cheese. 
No I don't know what Chaelo means. No I don't know why it's called Peter Cat either. I just like the place.
The service is crisp and efficient. The staffs are well dressed complete with turbans and vest coats. If you want to try the food (to review or taste) then visit during the day when it is easier to get a table.
I give this place a 5. Some like it and some don't. I like it and I suggest you to try it (:

Although this place is known for its Chello Kabab, I found the Chicken Mayonnaise and sizzlers to be equally awesome. While the food is always great, I wish they could be better with their service - at times the pride of being one of the oldest and best restaurants of the city is reflected in their behavior!

My recent visit to this famed restaurant on Park Street was an unpleasantly unforgettable one. The sizzler and the chelo kabab both tasted bad. The soup was a nightmare. It was like having boiled water. The salt dispenser was not working and we got salt served on a quarter plate. Could not torture myself any further. Dont know if they had a bad day but I am not visiting anytime soon.

If you are in Peter Cat, you have to have their famous Chelo Kabab. The taste is awesome. The rest of the food is good too. The only problem is waiting. If you are their at peak time, you have to get your name registered and wait for the table. Typical waiting time can vary from 20 mins to 40 mins. Of course, once you get a table, the service is good and so is food.

My order at this place has remained the same for ever now

1) minestrone italienne 
2) prawn cocktail.
3) chelo Kabab/ chicken stake

every one of which is my favorite and i wouldnt replace it for anything. All the above are done perfectly here and the service at this resturant is awesome i.e. really quick.

The only down side is that just like me this place has too many lovers and hence every time you pay a visit here, waiting is a must.

But i suppose by now i am mentally prepared to wait when i am going to peter cat.

Awesome place with no complains other than d waiting ofcourse.

It would have been sheer injustice had I not started my reviewing spree in Zomato with Peter Cat. There are tons of nostalgic moments associated with this restaurant that will remain etched in my memory forevermore.

This is one place where I have been a regular from childhood, the reason being that it's my parents favorite restaurant even after dining out at numerous other fine dining restaurants. The food still manages to amaze me every time I go in there. The vinegar soaked onions and achhar up front, the tasty chanachur/dalmoot to go with the drinks, mutton raan, chelo kebabs, aromatic sizzler, hah ! I can go on raving about this place for a life time.

I particularly love the decor with the dim lights and even have two favorite tables (one is a table for two and another a four-seater if I go with my full family) on the 1st floor, which the waiters are kind enough to provide me with in majority of my visits :)

The staffs are courteous and try to help you out in every ways possible. Price is reasonable when compared to similar counterparts. Only downside is the long waiting time in the cramped up space on special days & occasions. Apart from that, it will always be among the first three restaurants on my all time list.

Must Haves - Prawn cocktail, Jal Jeera , Cream Of Sweet Corn Chicken Soup, Dum Ki Raan, Mutton Badam Passanda, Chelo Kebab, Sizzler, Peter Cat Special Ice Cream.

I've been visiting this place for years especially for its attraction of the Chelo Kababs. I cannot recollect any time when it has failed to impress me. It's located in Park Street opposite KFC.

The sweet corn soup is healthy and tasty. Chicken Reshmi Kabab Masala is good too. The Staff there are well-mannered and the ambience actually quite is ordinary with lamps situated at the middle of each table. The lighting is quite dark.

I would suggest you to visit the place and try out some of their speciality dishes.

I can simply describe this restaurant with one word "Excellent". We had visited this place on last Thursday. This was a very much planned visit since we had read many reviews about this restaurant and their famous Chelo Kabab. We where a team of four and landed there around 1.30 pm on a working day. We were able to get a place instantly even-though the place was completely packed. Our order include some prawn and chicken started, Sizzler and a Chelo Kabab. With my experience with other places i was expecting the serving time of ~20 mins, but they had surprised us by serving the order with in 3 mins. I  think they have everything ready and they just server as soon as the order get placed. Starters were of little disappointment for me as they were cold as ice. I decided to forgive them considering the time they took to serve. Their signature chelo kabab was really good also the sizzler. They had another surprise waiting for us that is their pricing.. being from bangalore I was expecting the bill of arround 5-6K but the bill was arrounf just 2.3K for four.

famous for chelo kabab and it's a must have if one visits peter cat. other foods are good too, e.g. chicken afghani and grilled bhekti. price is a bit on the higher side. but the biggest problem is getting a table during the weekends. often you need to wait for 30-40mins in the peak period of 8-10pm. alcohol price is reasonable considering this is a premium restaurant in park street area. ambiance is nice, ethnic. waiters are all polite and doesn't delay in servicing customers. overall, a must visit if you love chelo kabab.

One of my favorite places in kolkata would be- PETER CAT!

MAIN HIGHLIGHT of this restaurant would be- Its very popular and signature dish- CHELO KEBAB- Serves rice,butter,egg poach, Chicken reshmi kebab, mutton sheek kebab. Other recommended dish would be-SIZZLERS.
WAITING TIME : for this place is too much whenever you go. The waiting time on an average goes from 30mins -1hr. 
SERVICE: is fast...as in the food is served very fast, waiters are decent, cutlery is old.
PRICE- Reasonable.
AMBIANCE: Standard, not so good.

If you want to enjoy a good meal at a reasonable price in park st without caring much about the ambience, this wud be the best place for sure.

Cheers to peter cat!

I'd heard a lot about Peter Cat and their signature Chelo Kebabs, and during my last visit to Cal I decided to visit this place with a friend. It was a weekend and understandably crowded, but I surely hadnt expected the queue to extend till Music World. It took us about an hour to get a table, and we whiled away the waiting time having gelatos from the kiosk on the corner and checking out novels at the street vendor right outside the restaurant.

When we were finally ushered in,  we were a little taken aback by the dim red interiors. We had expect something a little better considering the demand of the place. We were seated at the table right in the end, just outside the kitchen and restrooms and didn't quite like the disturbance caused by passerbys. It wasn't quite the beginning to the evening.

I ordered their Cassic Chelo Kabab that I heard so much about. I was served a plate of hot steamed rice with butter on top and Mutton Seekh Kababs and a sort of Chicken Malai Tikka on the side. It was a nice dish (3/5) with subtle flavors but far from the fireworks I had expected. My friend, a Cal guy, had also ordered the same dish and found it ecstatic, and for the first time I doubted if Calcutta people really knew their food.

All in all, a nice experience. One must visit Peter Cat at least once for the Chelo Kababs, but a second visit - not so much.

Infact, even while writing the review I am feeling hungry at the thought of those delicious platters. Chicken Steak sizzler is my personal favorite. Chelo kebabs are ok. I also like the Prawn Cocktail!!! Haven't tried the Indian cuisine there but have seen lots of people eating it, so will definitely try next time I visit!!!

On an idle afternoon during our recent vacation at Kolkata, we were looking for a good luncheon option around Park Street...on being heavily recommended by my niece, we ambled towards Peter Cat. As we approached its entrance, we came across a sizable crowd all impatient to secure a table. Considering it was end December, the peak party time of Kolkata we had to wait for cool 40 minutes to get a table for four of us. 

It's high time Peter Cat does something about the ambiance...dimly lit interiors reminded me of Europe from WW II years...tradition may not always mean getting bogged down with the time warp! Maitre-d' was prompt though in taking orders, helping us out with the menu and guiding us in choosing right portions. 

We ordered two portions of chicken asparagus soup (Rs.122.00 per portion) for four of us and one plate each of tandoori prawn (Rs.370.00), roast chicken sizzler (Rs.220.00), chicken Marrakesh (Rs.270.00) and Chelo kebab (Rs.270.00), the greatest signature dish of the restaurant! For dessert, my daughter chose chocolate souffle (Rs.120.00). While the soup was good in quantity and with right aroma, tandoori prawn had only six mid-sized species. The roast chicken sizzler was passable but the over hyped Chelo kebab was downright greasy; we rather liked the other variant, kebabs in chicken Marrakesh better. Chocolate souffle came in a large quantity to cater to famous Kolkata sweet tooth!

The bottom line: people in large numbers still throng in Peter Cat as Calcuttans have a huge appetite for the legacy...the moderate price-line in a fancy place like Park Street helps too.

Went there today (30.12.12) with my family. Disappointing experience. Chelo Kabab was the only item that was as good as we expected it to be. The Mixed  Tandoori Sizzler is a freaking disaster. Passionately Recommended was written in parenthesis beside the name in the menu, but I sure won't be doing it anytime soon.

Cost is really worth every penny... Among the other dishes only the Ran is something worth mentioning. The ambiance is good. The food is not very costly considering the location being park street. The service if fairly ok. On the whole a good place for dining. If you have not have the sizzlers, you should definitely try it...It is definitely the best sizzler in the town!!!!

The place is over rated according to me.Food quality has definately dropped over the years.Sizzlers and chelo kebabs are still the special dishes here. Worst biryani i've ever had, Prawn cocktail was full of ketch up. Drinks are just too much over priced. Well decoration does not raise the standard the food and rude behaviours of their staffs. Among my 8-9 visits i cant remember a single above then the average service..

Peter Cat doesnt need a review. And the best thing is, you can never book for a secure reservation if you intend to spend your weekend evenings at this quintessential restaurant of Calcutta. It is always packed, and you need to wait with patience, a rumbling tummy and a meandering patience to ultimately get in. And the, you can have a seat. Either you can make a move up the staircase to the first floor, or settle yourself on the ground floor. As people always throng the place, the buzz, hums and murmurs are constant. You would be attended quick, because the waiters know their job well here. A faint strain of Victorian Rule still lingers here and there, and Peter Cat still manages to contain that past fervour. I like it in here. I like the ambiance, the crowd, the laughs, the giggles, the clinking of china dinner plates, the whiff of kebabs, sizzlers and everything else that defines it. Peter Cat, still, is all about food. And when it is food indeed, I would always and irrevocably be in mad love with the Chello Kebab. It is what it boasts of. And so shall it be. Apart from the patent dish, other cuisines available here are well-served and well cooked. You would have a good time. Do spend a little and crib not for this place is what you need to experience again and again. And as I said, Peter Cat doesnt need a review and a review wont matter for its ever-grande existence.

I have seen the food served at this place go down. I remember a couple of years ago, the mutton hamburger steak was dry and hard and tasted of some awful Indian spice!

We visited again on 07.12.2012. Armed with coupons with a deal on their famed cello kabab from Groupon. We had to enter our name rand number in a register even before we started our meal.

We ordered a prawn cocktail to go with it. Fairly made, with largish prawns too. Wish the thousand islands dressing was a tad crisper.

The cello kabab was nothing to write home about. It was not served very warm. The three cubes of butter never did melt. The mutton kabab was not very tasty. Parts of it looked like it had been nibbled. The chicken kabab was far better looking but suffered from not being warm enough. The rice was fair. I do not recall getting a grilled tomato as displayed in the photograph.

I do not understand why these restaurants tend to sit on their laurels. Nothing very wrong with the service though. It was reasonable.

The Thums Up was excellent as always :)

A visit in April 2014. The Mutton Hamburger steak was just as Indian in taste, though seemed perhaps a little better. The accompaniments seemed better prepared. I tried a Bloody Mary, which was too watered down. The Baked Chicken with well browned cheese on top had good comfort food appeal. Harem's Joy (fabulous sounding, but turned out to be chicken in a makhani style gravy did not impress. The Chello / Marrakesh was just  like before, the mutton seekh portion of it was awful!. When will they make it better?

Have been patronising Peter Cat since the 1970s! Have always been there for lunch and have had to wait for a table most of the time. Tip: if you do not want to wait for a table then make sure you are there around noon.
In the 1970s our favourite used to be Chicken Bharta & Nan. Presently, it is Chelo-Kabab & its variations and Kabuli Nan.

Everybody knows everything possible to know about Peter Cat. Not much to update. Every Bengali knows how intricately woven Peter Cat is in their lives.  Whenever anything good happens "let's go to Peter Cat ". All we have to share is the experiences .. The sense of excitement when the House Special Sizzler sizzles its way to your table while the family two tables next to you stop their conversation abruptly to check where all the commotion is coming from. And you look at the plate in front of you to realize that you are the king, while you have that tender steak and the sausages accompanied with the bread rolls and butter.  (forget diet for one day) . And the moment when the platter of chello kebab is served to you and a wave of tsunami hits the insides of ur mouth.  With the soft and tender kebabs caressing ur taste buds, supported by the buttery rice!!!!!  And you look up at God, thanking Him,  for making life so beautiful.  I'd give 5 stars not for the food (I've already shown how much I love it) but for the Gentlemen who serve us in a very dignified 90s style and all the memories made.

Again great ambience  & delicious north  indian  food . my only issue here is the price which is on the higher side . if you want to have a full course meal here then the bill for two would come around rs 1500  to  be more realistic . try upstairs of petercat  it is more cosy than downstairs . well we had 1 fish makhmali ( rs 250) + 1  tandoori prawn ( rs 355) 3 fresh lime soda  (rs 48  X 3 = 144 ) + 1 tandoori mixed grill sizzler  ( rs 273 ) +  3 butter naan ( rs 64 X 3 =  192)  + 1  prawn butter masala (  rs 260  )  + 1   shah nauz ( Rs 197  ) & the bill came a thundering Rs 1670  + VAT + service tax  =  RS 1985  ... that for me was the souring point . otherwise a great destination if you are affluent enough .  & remember our bill was WITHOUT ALCOHOL , so if you are budgeting with alcohol then expect a FAT bill .

heard that getting a table here is a problem always...both on weekdays and holidays or weekends. Me and my boyfriend both were afraid of facing such, bt fortunate enough we got a table at once without even waiting. Ordered the most famous chelo kabab as usual. Peter cat, the name says all. Don't have to describe the taste, I guess, at all. Tried the prawn cocktail also, but frankly speaking I didn't like it at all. Cost is Rs.175. That was just a total waste of money, though its my personal point of view. Warm decor, nice ambience, waiters dressed as pathans...will come back again soon for the chelo kabab.  :)

Well, there are certain restaurants i am absolutely biased towards & Peter Cat happens to be one of them!
Firstly its located in PARK STREET so, half battle is won there.
Now, what can I say about this place? I simply love it! Right from the decor, the furniture and even the waiters! Oh wait, I don't know them personally but the fact that they have been working for so many years keeping up the good service everyday is commendable. Now the food. Last time I went there I had Chicken Tandoori. Good pieces of chicken all juicy and tasty with Pudina chutney tasted awesome.Then, for the main course I had a sizzler dish of Baked Bhetki and as always I didn't leave anything on my plate for even a tiny ant to survive on. Have tried Prawn Cocktail and Chello Kebab there before, which were lip-smacking.
So if there is anybody out who HAS NOT been to Peter Cat, you all are missing out on something really brilliant.

Great ambience. Super cool (or hot??) menu. A place you can come with your family and end with your old friends.

Chello Kabab is the most famous and believe me, it's awesome. But it is not only saviour of this resturant. Every item they serve is classic. 

My personal favourite apart from chello Kabab is Vegetable begum bahar, Chicken Tandoori

Very crowdy place, specially in weekends and holidays.

okay!! understood, i got it Chelo Kabab ....will try. Was my usual amused retort to my dear Kolkata colleges...Finally went their one Sunday and was full hence finally had to come again! which came a month later anyway

Thankfully we got a table for two with just a 5 mins wait...and thereafter immersed ourselves into the menu.... ordered the Mutton Chelo Kebab, Sausages  and Kasundi Tikki

Frankly for all i heard about the Chelo Kabab ...it was more of a a Malai tikka with a few accouterments....and maybe a combination of all three or 4 ( Seekh kabab ? ) in a spoon full tasted evolved it was still not worth the fanfare

The sausages done simply with think pepper were good and as expected...familiar....the Kasundi Tikka was either thoroughly original or the Kasundi i am used to is more pronounced...latter seeming true

Overall the experience ok but not stellar especially if you took a yellow cab from Rajarhat to Park street at 7:30 in the evening.....

The Mystery of the Chelo Kebab or rather the mysterious fanfare....peace

Getting a table on a holiday is a problem....but the food is lip-smackingly delicious...The Cello Kebab, both the vegetarian and non- vegetarian versions are excellent, if you do not mind the dollop of butter on the tiny mound of rice.So, weight watchers...watch out.The Prawn Cocktail is good, too, and so is the Chicken Sizzler ( according to my son)..but I go to Peter Cat only and only for Cello Kebab.

Over hyped is the only term that comes to my mind when i think about PETER CAT.

Initially when i use to visit the place i was more curious about the kind of food that they serve. But nowadays i am quite surprised with kind of customer service that they provide. Its one of the pathetic service that they provide. I dont know how long they can continue with a legacy menu called "CHELO KABAB" legacy. 

Anyways coming about the food - Chelo kabab is worth mentioning but that does not excite me anymore. To speak about other menu will be useless as its not value for money.

Its mere shadow now compared to old days. I will not recommend shelling out money down here.

Giving it one star because that's the least this site has. I had heard a lot about it, tried yesterday, and, had a very very bad experience.
First: No valet parking.

The guy who was taking order( His name was "SUNNY" probably a new joinee) was very rude and totally unfit for hospitality industry itself.
To start with, he brought me the wrong order. He didn't know the difference between "Virgin Mary" and Virgin Mojito".

A lot of items from menu were not available, and when we asked for a little tweaking, he very rudely said whatever is in the menu is only available.
When I asked if the have a feedback form, the waiter turned blank, as if he had never heard of it.
But the worst part was when we overheard him talking to another guy asking what if these customers complain, to our shock, the other guy replied "Let them complain, nothing would happen".
So my advice "Don't go there".

One of Kolkata's age old and favourite food joints that has stood the test of time and the changes in the culinary connoisseurs' taste & culture. Absolutely awesome steak, sizzlers, kebabs and fabulous house special Chello Kabab. Be prepared for long waiting times on weekends and Fridays. Nice retro decor and warm service too. I generally avoid lunch hours.

YUMMRAJ Demystifies the Legend of Peter Cat & comes up with a rating of 3.75/5

In a nutshell:

A retro restaurant (not by design but coz they never changed with time) with a great ambience, old school staff, good food for the prices that they charge but nowhere as good compared to the 'real thing'- be it European or Persian.

Short Description - In case u r in a hurry:

Peter Cat has been around for decades & that speaks a lot - Restaurants open very often & close down almost as often. The ones who survive the test of time surely have something good / unique to offer.

The decor as I mentioned above is retro in today's context - red sofas facing each other & nice lamp shades above each table. The lighting is dim overall but the lamps on each table illuminate the table good enough to see each other, have a good chat & enjoy some good food. There are two floors & the way to top floor is as grand as it can get.

Waiting staff look Grand as well, with their sherwani suits, flamboyant headgear & pointed shoes. Most of them are however quite Old School - smooth talking, knowledgeable, not overtly attentive but attentive as well, not quite warm, talks with an air of authority interspersed with some rare smiles & I guess quite bored of doing the same job for donkey's years...... & that shows on their face. U will enjoy the evening if u think this to b a part of the package - dining at a retro restaurant & being served by people who r enacting the past
The food is good in general & at the prices that the food is offered, I wud say some are excellent. However, if u compare the non- Indian dishes to the original dishes the way they r, then u might b quite disappointed.

Detailed Description - In case u have the time to njoy reading:

To start, we ordered for 'Betki Muenier' from 'Chef's Special Seafood section'. There was no description of the food & hence we had no choice but to ask the waiting staff for recommendation regarding which of the dishes to choose in this section.

As soon as the food was served, we knew that it will be good. The looks were so confident. As the fish landed on my taste buds, the taste buddies got thrilled & cried out in joy. We cleaned off the full plateI guess in less than two minutes flat................awesome is the word. It turned out to b a batter fried fish served with white creamy sauce in such a way that the crunchiness of the batter was gone & it formed an even interesting texture. 

Along with the fish there were a bunch of dry spicy half potatoes - They tasted excellent as well. 

The letdown in this dish was the boiled veggies - they were overcooked & had lost crunchiness. 

I wud still give this dish a 4.5/5 inspite of the veggies being not up to the mark.

Post this we were served the Legendary Chelo Kabab - I say Legendary & it is actually. I always knew this but it got reinforced after I started my blog. Every single day loads of people reach my blog searching for 'peter cat chelo kabab'. Peter Cat claims in its menu card 'The protected Regional product of West Bengal'. I am surprised why they say so but they do.

Chelo Kabab is an Iranian (Persian) dish in which freshly made kababs are served on a bed of long grained aromatic rice. I was lucky enough to taste the chelo Kabab at different Iranian Restaurants in other countries. I was particularly floored by the Chelo Kabab at Persian Room, Arizona, USA. There the rice was like a good Lucknowi Dum Biryani sans the dripping ghee.

Peter Cat's Chelo Kabab has mid-grained steamed rice in the base but has two dollops of Amul Butter that make the rice sinfully good. However, it is unable to match the original version by a wide gap. I wud give the Peter Cat rice 3/5.

The 'Original Chelo Kabab' of Peter Cat has one set of chicken kababs & two mutton seekh kababs. There is also a mutton Chelo kabab in which all kababs r mutton. The server suggested that we go for the 'original'.

The chicken kababs that came with the Chelo Kabab were good but usual. They were not juicy, not melt in the mouth but very tasty & flavorful. Any good chicken kabab in Kababland Purani Dilli wud b juicier & softer. I wud give a 4/5 to the taste & 3/5 to the texture & hence overall 3.5/5 for the chicken kababs.

The mutton kababs were bad at texture as well - brittle, not soft, not juicy, not chewy either but quite good to taste. Flavors were very enjoyable too. I wud give this 2/5 for texture, 3.5/5 for taste & hence overall 2.75/5 for the mutton kababs.

Overall the Chelo Kabab thus wud be 3/5. However, considering that Chelo Kabab at Peter Cat is less than US$5 as compared to close to US $ 10 - 15 in most of the places I have eaten, I wud say that the Chelo Kabab at Peter Cat is a great dish to have at that price - ultimate value for money.

Sizzlers - The third dish that we had was again 'Legendary' according to Peter Cat's Table Mats.

 As we reached the page in menu card with 'sizzlers', we asked about the most popular sizzlers. We were told 'House special - Chicken Steak with sausages & liver' & we ordered the same.

The Sizzler was again very good for Rs. 250 but if judged in isolation, the sizzler was just good. Kobe Sizzlers serves much better sizzlers in India. The sauce of the sizzler was a bit confused in taste. It was not bad but not good either - just about OK. I wud say 2.5 / 5.

The chicken piece was good in terms of texture & taste. I wud say 4/5.
The sausages were very ordinary - like the kinds u can buy off Supermarket shelves. Soft & smooth in texture but lacking a character of its own (in terms of taste). I wud give this 3/5.

The liver was very enjoyable. I wud say 4.5/5

Overall I wud give the sizzler 3.5/5.

In terms of the overall food experience at Peter Cat, the rounded off score adds up to 3.75/5.

We washed down our meal with fresh lime soda Sweet & salt that failed to make a statement. It was not bad though.

I guess Peter Cat has a bright long future simply for the price-value equation that they have mastered over time. It also has a very die-hard fan following. For culinary freaks & hardcore foodies with an exposure to the 'real thing', Peter Cat might not appeal as much.

Good food is not what you eat with your heart's content. You can not content your heart with good food. No matter how much you eat, you will always want more.
The same goes for Chello Kebab of Peter Cat. Every time I have it, I want to go back again. This dish is worth the journey I have to make from my home to get there.
Good ambiance but they should upgrade their service a bit. Takes a lot of time for someone to come to your table and take the order and then again a long wait for the food to arrive.
Then again, the food is really worth it all. And that is what matters at a restaurant.

Nicely lit, well decorated, this place gives you a good feeling from the very first minute! Food is no doubt good.. Chelo  kebabs are famous, and I agree they're good, but I like grilled mutton steak better! Do NOT forget to try the prawn cocktail, the perfect blend of sweet and spice would make you go gaga over it! The first name that comes to mind while going for a dine out, Peter Cat will always stay in my favorites list!

Visited there during Puja time, but really pleased to see that management is handling the crowd very well. We ordered a mocktail and the famous Chello Kebabs and 'Souffle of day' for dessert.  Chello Kebabs , nothing else to say, simply delicious in moderate price. But that 'Souffle of the day' was an utter surprise!! Its a mint based chocolate flavored ice cream (not too cold) toped with choco chips. Just loved the taste in the end. Decor was good and service also.

The Chelo Kebab is something which is really awesome here and everyone knows that but I would rate the sizzlers also at the top of the list. I specially like the fish steak sizzler.. Really awesome for fish lovers. I would personally not recommend the Mutton hamburger steak though my wife loves it. Finish your meal with the brownie :-)

This is one place in Park Street where you always find a crowd standing outside, waiting to get in and experience perhaps the best continental and Indian food in town!! Chelo Kebab, perhaps the most famous food item in their menu is a delicacy to die for!! Add to that the amazing steaks and the mutton raan!!
Warm decor, great service and delicious food, this place is a must visit place not only in Park Street but all of Kolkata!!
Cheers to Peter Cat!!

The only dish I always try is Chelo Kebaba..the best chelo kebab ever!! Well cooked rice & both the mutton & chicken kebab's are spicy & tender.  This is a signature dish of Peter cat & must try.
Otherwise the menu doesn't guide you to a right kind of cuisine, it really need a big improvement on the menu.
Overall ambiance/cleanliness/service is good. But the waiting to get a table during weekends is close an hour! 
They should start tele booking.

If I rewind my life and watch it on a screen...there would be moments when i am young, there would be moments when I feel low, there would be moments I would just let loose of everything. No moment is constant in a persons lifa. But what is constant is a place called peter Cat. I was introduced to this plca e when i couldnt even read the menu by my Grandmother and trust me today when i dont have her with me this place offers me the warmth which she use to emit. I have spend the most lovely time of childhood with my father here. And now after 26years of living..i enjoy every weekend with my would be in its gallore. 

Nostalgic...is the word i feel whenevr i write about this place

you cannot miss the sizzling sound of the sizzler which smells like christmas in every season. Chello kebab is a speciality ...and what a way they have preserved their speciality. Kudos to the management. Every child should taste their Sunday Casata a delicious dessert with Icecream and cake and a concoction even God's are not aware of. And yes my personal Favourite Tutty Fruity.... Its really tutty as i almosy become dumb when i indulge into the creamy demon.....Mind Boggling.
And the Prawn Cocktail
Served in a brass cup which is layered with ice so you get the right temperature throughout the time you have it...the prawns are just ready to melt in your mouth and the thousand island sauce is chart topper....

Over all PETER CAT is where Calcutta Celebrates!!

I recently went again and discovered this fantastic thing called the Roast Chicken Sizzler. Unlike most sizzlers, the smoke goes down quicker without over burning any of the ingredients. The chicken is very very tender and make sure you have it with their bread roll. Yet another feather in the cap for Peter Cat.

The Cello Kebab was as usual fantastic. They never get it wrong, to the point of perfectly done rice. 
If you have not been there, please do before the world ends.

And, this might seem very expensive. But, honestly its not Most of them are below 150. I wonder how do they keep their prices so low, with such quality food!



----- 31 Aug, 2012 -----

Close your eyes, shout out Chelo Kebab.
30 minutes later, you will wish for an another such act.

I have been hearing the name of peter cat and it's famous chelo kabab for many years but could not manage to go there. But last year i went there with one of my friends. I ordered chelo kabab at first without looking at the menu card. And what i got was the most delicious and tasty combination i ever had. After that we had kulcha,  mutton dopiyaza which were equally good.

Last Monday(on Ashtami) we went to have lunch in here.After waiting for nearly 20minutes we got our seats on upstairs.Our patent dishes are sizzlers and muniere.So we started with Sizzlers.Ordered House Special and Muttun Hamburger.

House Special was quiet good but the muttun hamburger sizzler was not up to that level(seriously).Then THIS man came and ADVISEd us to have some desserts because never he had the idea(may be) that we are not yet finished with the main course.We told him politely to bring the menu card and he sent another man to provide us the desserts again.Terrible.

Then we ordered Bekty Muniere and Chelo Kabab.Muniere was lovely like before but found the size smaller than my previous visits.Muniere is prepared with pure tenderness and care.Sooo smooth in mouth.Must try in there.

Now I come to the Not-oh-so-great Chelo Kabab.Please do not waste your money and appetite in this downgraded thing.Personally I hate to have it.

At last I had Warm Brownie with Vanilla ice-cream and hot dark chocolate which happens to be my personal favourite.Its gorgeous for any warm dark chocolate lover.

If you are with family always try to grab seats upstairs.Backward of the downstairs is quite filthy.

Peter Cat....Here goes my recommendation...for always and for all. Probably the best restaurant in Kolkata for what it offers can be treated as non-comparable. The place is packed for most of the time, so you may have to wait outside for a moment or two.

The restaurant offers its signature Chelo Kabab and Sizzlers. I had the opportunity to taste both. The Sizzler despite the recommendations did not suit me....but I was delighted to eat Chelo Kabab. This Chelo Kabab, the National dish of Iran, is made critically perfect by them....from the Mutton Kabab, the flavored Rice, the Chicken Kabab, placement of Egg and Butter along with Grilled Tomato was just perfect. The Fish Makhmali was also succulent and tender. You should also try their available desserts.

The prices are good enough for the quality they offer, ambiance is nice and humble and waiters are well behaved, learned and do not nag at all, giving you the pleasure of eating. A must-visit altogether. This place is heavenly!!!

The first thing that comes to my mind with 'Peter Cat' is the sizzler. The restaurant advertise that they serve the best sizzlers and yes they really do that. The sizzlers are a classic in this restaurant be it the normal Chicken sizzler, the mixed plate of 'House special' or the fusion 'Tandoori Mixed grill'.. all of them are worth a try. My personal favorite is the 'House special'. But apart from the sizzlers there are hardly a few dish that stands apart. Another highly hyped dish 'Chalo kebab' is a let down...its just a combination of 4-5 kebabs with some butter rice...nothing special. The Biriyani is something that you  shouldn't dare trying (specially if you had it in Arsalan/Zeeshan/Shiraz etc). Among the other dishes only the Ran is something worth mentioning. The ambiance is good. The food is not very costly considering the location being park street. The service if fairly ok. On the whole a good place for dining. If you have not have the sizzlers, you should definitely try it...It is definitely the best sizzler in the town!!!!

I was here for a quick meal with my significant other on a warm afternoon. The crowd inside didn't do much to cool things down. I had to resort to a beer. I ordered something which seemed a mix of cuisines. Since I wasn't there to test the food, i just gobbled it down. If you want to nit pick about the service or the overall ambience of the place you will find a lot of material. I don't think the food was bad, but it was nothing to write home about either. I believe a lot of Kolkatans rave about the food here. I think they need to go out of Kolkata and sample similar cuisines there. I didn't get a satisfied feeling when I left. Not sure I will go back there again

Peter Cat for me is synonymous with chelo kababs. Filling yet tasty and most importantly affordable, this place has never let me down come what may. 

Also the kababs are just too good to even write about because the image is so mouth watering and makes me wanna rush to this restaurant no matter what time of the day  it is!!!!

I have practically grown up eating the sizzlers here but there was an incident which happened not many days back, and I would like to mention it here...of course the line says so.. the place is always teeming with people and more people.. there is a queue every time you even cross that place .. always on the mouth of some foodie... great.. but not such great and wonderful experience from my end.. After a 45 min long wait , finally got a table there.. and ordered for a sizzler [chicken- peter cat signature] and mentioned to the steward that i am allergic and have problems with chicken liver and no mutton ... On complaining to the manager we were told that the liver could not be taken out cuz it was integral part of the platter. Its really hard to believe that liver cant be taken out if a customer asks so.. so it was really dissapointinh and not very well managed. Would not try going there again as i have lost all faith in eating sizzlers.. i am really sorry to comment like this but this was my personal experience. i would rate it as 

ambiance : 3
food quality : 2
service : 2
staff nature : 2

Growing up in Calcutta, I have spent a good many years visiting this place for weekend lunches and weekday dinners. Once upon a time it was truly magnificent, but its becoming a shadow of itself... although the food is still very good, which is what should matter.

Its gotta quirky charm to itself in the way its alarmingly dimly lit and the way they use giant brass goblets to serve beer in an otherwise average Park Street ambience. Be prepared for a 25-30 min wait on weekends.

The Chello Kabab is Legen...wait for it...Dary! Besides that, the Indian main course dishes are authentic and yet not very heavy on the stomach. My personal favourites are the Barkawalla and the Shah Nauz. The naans and kulchas are to-die-for. The steaks and other conti dishes are very well prepared as well. You will be spoilt with choice thanks to the rather extensive menu.

The waiters have become old and hence a tad bit impatient and inefficient, but if you speak to them politely and about something local (Dada, Didi or football), they may show you some of their old world charm, that gave Peter Cat the reputation it has.. 

A good place for a quick meal at a very reasonable price. May Peter Cat live on to serve my grandchildren as well!

One of Kolkata's value for money restaurant. The good old favourite chelo kebab, mixed grill sizzlers and chicken steaks still attract the old foodies of kolkata even though they might have to wait for hours to get a place to dine. I personally feel that they may have maintained the quality of food but the ambiance and lighting is very dull and unappetizing. Their presentation of food has gone down as compared to all the new restaurants in the city and they have made no effort to renovate or improve the conditions of the restaurant.

If you intend to come on a weekend, be ready to wait for atleast an hour an a half to enjoy their specialities.

Dimly lit ambience provides a great environment to dine in. 
Its great value for price

Things you should not miss : House special sizzler, Chelo Kabab , various cocktails, Fresh lime soda.

Hands down, Peter Cat is one of the best places to dine out in Kolkata. Lovely ambiance, Yummy food and Good crowd - everything is just perfect.

The non-veg menu is particularly rich - no dearth of items on the menu. For the veggies, try the mouth-watering mix veg grilled steak with double dinner bread.

For drink, order a Peter Cat cooler. With whisky and rum, it is one of their specials.

One of the finest place where I had North Indian food ever. The darkness there and the smell of sizzlers fills the place with wonder and its the best place for having "Chelo Kabab".  The best thing about that place is the hanging lamps between all the tables,which i like the most. The quantity is agreeable and the price is reasonable. The sizzlers are also delicious. The relaxed ambience is also very nice there. Really a  wonderful place and it is not monotonous.

'Chelo Kebab' goes hand in hand with Peter Cat. This is something which strikes you the moment you are reminded of Peter Cat. But moving a bit away from this I'll tell you what to try when you try to bell the Cat. 
Get yourself a cocktail of your choice. Mind you this place serves the best cocktails and there is a great variety to it. Along with it, try out the 'Chilly Chicken' Dry. You might say this is the most common side dish or most Chinese Restaurants serve better. But allow me to tell you the taste will last in your mouth forever because of the sheer difference from the other Chinese counterparts and the sheer similarity with the dish prepared at home. So simple, yet so delicious. I am literally drooling as I am writing this. Also the mutton and Chicken Liver are just mind blowing. Remember this, the next time you visit the place.

Undoubtedly, one of the most famous places in Kolkata. Since I arrived in Kolkta, people have been constantly dragging me to Peter Cat. The ambience is great, always full but the crowd is quiet. The service is fast and kind, always keeping an eye on you for whatever you need. The menu is quite varied and the drinks menu with its funny names gives a different feeling to this place, which otherwise would look too serious. 
However, the food, is it that awesome? Or is just the place, being with people you enjoy being with, what makes the experience a great one? I think it's the second. I've had better food at less famous and less crowded restaurants (and cheaper). But they are not Peter Cat, I guess.

Highly over rated. Peter Cat is one confused restaurant. What does it serve? Indian? Continental? Chinese? Middle eastern? 
A mix and match of everything with an Indian taste in all.
It is famous for its Chello Kababs. That's it.
No other food on the menu is even worth trying.
Rude waiters, poor service.
Evenings are always crowded, and getting a seat in under 30 mins is a blessing.
Parking is a night mare and they have not yet heard of valet parking.
I am sure there are better restaurants to try out in Kolkata.

When it comes to tandoori food, cant beat the place...amazing food, just cant fault it and the quantity i feel is huge so you need to have an European appetite. Plenty of options, need to go there agn and agn to try them all. Steaks/sizzlers, baked chicken and above all their famous Chelo kebabs which is a all time fav.of many kolkata diners. 

Ambience n serivice is good, but my my you have to wait for ages to get in so best you book a table and be there on time or else wait in the queue and smell the good food!!!!

Also very reasonably priced if you exclude alcohol. So be calculative when you go there. Enjoy!!!

Oh yeah, the continental food lovers like me will simply love it. You cannot expect a purely authentic taste though, but can expect a sumptuous spread. All I can say is that the place is a 'must visit' for continental & kebab lovers. 

Do expect the service to be a little slothful, but you can expect a value for money meal at the end. Overall, I would recommend the people at least to visit this place once to make an opinion for themselves.

Chelo Kabab, Sizzlers - Evertime I go to Peter Cat, I make sure that I have atleast one of these - and sometimes both. 
Even if I am to make a choice of food for luncheon meetings, I get the chelo kabab from Peter Cat. The chelo kabab, as it is neither too spicy nor too timid, have always being appreciated by guests. 
To keep the price constant the resturant was decreasing the quantity for quite some time; but last year better senses prevailed, they increased the price as well as quantity...
But there are too many service people wondering in the resturant - and it is pretty annoying at times...

After reading many reviews for this restaurant, all I have to say is this:

Old-school restaurant, equally old-school serving staff and stewards. 
Good sizzlers, over-priced bar menu! 
Extremely OVER-CROWDED on weekends! Tremendous waiting period if yo go in for a late-dinner. 
During weekends (atleast this is what I've experienced), if you are occupying a table just trying to have a good conversation with people in your company AND NOT ORDERING anything, the stooges or the waiters will keep coming to you and pester you to order food? 
When I queried them if they  were in a hurry to kick me out of their restaurant, THEY SAID:- "SIR, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE..!!" (go figure that one?)

MOST annoyingly-hilarious fact about this restaurant is that the buggers don't allow you to celebrate a birthday/anniversary etc. by way of cutting a cake which you may have brought from outside.
Umm, no! They don't have their own confectionery that you are forced to buy from! No matter how much you plead/argue/FIGHT with serving staff & stooges, they will simply not allow you the happiness of celebrating inside their restaurant!

Trust me you wont mind waiting for 45 minutes to get a place in this joint, because its totally worth it!!!! One of the legendary Kolkata-defining restaurant on Park Street,a meal in here will make your day! I can never have enough of their Mutton Chelo kebab, with the smooth buttery rice, well made sheekh kebabs and the other kebab which just melts in your mouth, its a dish every Kolkatan loves and every non kolkatan should try to have a never before experience! The tandoori mixed grill and the continental mixed grill will definitely give you a run for your money, the simmering platter is just irresistable with an odour which will tantalize your taste buds and make you salivate helplessly!!!!! I have never really been able to get out of these 3 selections in peter cat but the ala carte dishes are equally famed!!! For a starter the fried suasages and the prawn cocktail are my favorites ofcourse!!!! The Chelo Kebab in peter Cat has a magnetic attraction which pulls me to that restaurant once in a fortnight atleast, otherwise the going becomes difficult,its that addictive!!!! :)

The mixed grill sizzler is more of a mixed 'liver' grill sizzler..and more often than not overcooked..If you want a bit of the old Calcutta charm..please do visit but there are a lot of new kids on the block giving the ol chello a run for its money.

1. A mid priced three star restaurant
2. You get what you pay for
3. I have been going to this classic for the last 12 years for some of the same stuff
3. The mysterious chelo kabab - people either hate it or love it. Let me break it down: A simple meal of Basmati rice, cubes of butter, 4 cubes of mutton kabab, 4 cubes of chicken kabab and a poached egg, priced at under Rs 200. Quite straighforward. My issue with this item has been its inconsistent preparation over the many years I have had this. 70% of the time, over a period of 12 years, it is moist and tender, but the other 30% of the time there are inconsistencies. Also, the mutton kababs have changed from a moist style to gravy style, so I have been surprised in that regard. I have a preference for fresh tastes, and in the gravy style I found it to be spicy. Either way it was well cooked, just that I personally do not prefer spicy.
3. I love the french fries and bhekti munier (butter fried bhekti) that must be eaten as soon as it arrives.

First of all, this might sound weird but i didn't like the Chello Kebab. It's my personal opinion, I think it's over hyped and the price is quite high which is not worth the taste. I also tasted the Chicken asparagus soup and the Mutton Dopiyaza. According to me the mutton tasted better. Also i never knew Tandoori Rotis are made of Wheat their and not Flour, not expected but i liked how the taste of it mixed well with the Mutton. Well, to end it all i was pretty disappointed with the food which was not worth the high prices. But then again it's a place well renowned, so better go and check it out yourselves.

The old favorite..the magnificent chelo kebab is known to everyone i guess,anyone who has tasted it will recommend it, the steaks are not bad.In desserts mango cream is worth a mention.i personally do not like the ambiance much, the service is a bit sluggish.Off late though,i feel they are slipping a bit(with respect to taste of the food).

Disappointing Experience

I was highly recommended PeterCat on a short visit to Kolkata- but the food disappointed me. The Kababs were dry and the food fairly ordinary. The famous Chelo Kabab - is NOT a Kabab. It serves rice, kabab and a fried egg - wasnt prepared for this and had ordered it as a starter. The service also left a lot to be desired.

Pathetic service,Bad etiquettes. beer served in a normal glass tumbler, shocked tht they didn't have mug. The mug came after 20 mins, then they didn't change the beer. This restaurant is only running on name. Other two families were shouting for their food. None of the waiters had any idea hpw long will it take. Finally switched to mocambo. Much better Exactly opposite service.

Ever seen a sea of people waiting patiently every single day during mealtime in a line in Middleton Row often extending upto Park Street ? No this is not a voting booth, this is Peter Cat ! Undoubtedly one of
the city's most popular eating spots, Peter Cat provides the ideal mix of classy ambience coupled with mind-blowing food. The world-famous ( I am not exaggerating !) Cello Kebab is this restaurant's very own novelty. The pricing of the menu is reasonable and the service prompt. One thing you definitely need before planning a visit to Peter Cat : unlimited patience to see yourself through the queue. Whether you have it or not, trust me, it is worth the wait.

The place is over rated according to me.Food quality has definately dropped over the years.Sizzlers and chelo kebabs are still the special dishes here.

Where are we going for lunch? Peter Cat!! You always get waiting there..rush..and I found myself hurrying towards Middleton row with a bunch of over enthusiastic colleagues who wanted me to savour a meal there.

Luckily the dash got us a seat at the far corner, and I could see the victory on my companions faces. 

We ordered Chelo kebabs and House Sizzlers. The sizzlers were good but the restaurant seems to be overly enthusiastic about their veggies, too much of potato and carrots that the sausages and chicken had to be digged into. The chicken was juicy and the dish was if not 5 but 4 on the scale.

Chelo kebabs unlike other kebabs is like a kebab platter served with rice. Naah! That don't Impress me much..

The place is quite dark and old, and the seating is cramped.The tables are small. The service is not a winner too. But thats something I have got accustomed to at all places which have big names.

If i look back to the life i have lived....memories of near ones would e there,heart breaks, rejoices.And in them all one thing is common PETER Cat. This restraunt has been a witness of my life literally. My first visit with my dad that was dazzled by the exotic Mediternean flavour of the Chelo Kebab....the soft and homely smell of the melting butter lusturing the Basmati rice...and the marsh mellow soft and juicy chickens....trust me i can go on and on about it. We afternoon retreats from homework with my Grandmother was always assorted with The baked fish Peter Cat Served...and i can take an oath about it's simplicity yet it it had the thrill like a new lover...The cheese crust accompanied with the soft white sauce and fish, the herbs adding glee to every bite taken in the mouth...and that gush of the cheese melting inside....I felt the warmth of my Grandmother still when i have it there.The ambience was always known to me.from my first visit when i was 6 till day before yesterday now when I am 25.The sizzlers always remin ded me of Christmas Carrol....the gush of smoke tentalizing the taste buds...you want to eat it yet it's piping hot!!!Freshness is the key word..and the cordination of the spices and each and every flavour is better than the best Ballerinas in the world.
Peter Cat!!! I just cant think of my life without you!!!

One of the most favorite haunts in the 90's since stayed just down the road in Middleton row (BTW the address is park street, but it is situated in the Middleton row).

A place where lovely kababs, nawabi stuff (chelo kababs), including lovely paneer dishes and of course the steaks were amazingly good. Checked it last year & found it surprisingly still good enough.

Always will have a soft spot for it.....the wife & i spent some good times there.

The only thing that I eat here is Chelo Kababs,, and nothing else. The only slight variation I'v ever had is Chicken Marrkesh,which is very similar.Though a few of my friends have tried the House special Sizzlers and Mutton biryani.Its dimly light and very crowded on weekends.But the price is good, the portions and the food is really really nice. I recommended this place to anyone and everyone.A must visit on Park Street.

On a two day visit to Kolkata, went to this place for lunch after a friend's recommendation. Was expecting some special Bengali style food. It was just a normal fine-dine restaurant. Drinks were available and at normal prices. Food was disappointing. The supposedly famous Chole Kababs were ordered thinking it was some kind of starters only to find that is kind of Combo meal with rice and few pieces of meat. Next came Prawns in a big steel dish. Priced at around 250/ plate we thought it was a good deal. After having 4 pieces from it, found that rest were Potato Wedges :( That was deceiving. Isnt sea food supposed to be cheap in coastal areas? Okay, this an upscale restaurant, but at least they should serve a plate full of food whatever price it may be. Eat at places like Kerala and Goa if you dont understand. Finally we thought there is nothing great to expect from this place. Had few more drinks and ordered biryanis as it was nearing time for us to leave. Biryani was average, again huge potato pieces more than chicken. I dont understand this concept. Is chicken very expensive in this city? And no gravy/raitha with the biryani. When asked, the manage politely said we have to order that separately. This was the most irritating part. Ordered raitha for 100 bucks extra only to find it also has fruits in it. I have had biryanis from several places, from 60 to 600, I can say this was the worst because of their conditions. If you want a drop of curd with a biryani priced at 250 bucks, we have to spent 100 extra. I would keep quiet if this was a 5 star (even 5stars dont have such conditions nowadays), but this a just a normal hotel with good interiors. Overall, a very bad experience at this place. This was my first and probably last visit in the city. I am sure there must be great places in this city, but I missed it and felt I was taken for a ride in Petercat. I love bengali food. My favourite place for Bengali cuisine is Oh Calcutta here in Bangalore.

Well, to explain my obsession with food, I would have to quote American author Fran Lebowitz: "My favorite animal is steak." And talking about steaks the first thing that comes to mind is Peter Cat and its legendary chicken steak sizzler. The whole treat starts from the point you hear the hiss of your meal approaching your way, then u sight it in its own smoky halo & as it comes closer to be plated its aroma starts flirting with u. Finally as u cut through it with the knife, u know the texture is perfect. And then it is love at first bite. Heavenly!!!

been to this place for more than 30 times, everytime for dinner and drink. First time I confused with chelo (thought this as some normal kebabs and ordered them with drinks :P ) - chela - dum ki rung are two must try things. ambienece is a little creepy but the food compensates it all.

Cheers.

An old restaurant of Park St. but still holds the reputation. Food is awsome. Service and ambiance is okay. "Chelo Kabab" and "Chicken steak sizzler" became legends - must try if u visit here. Other items are good too..spcly "Dum ki Run".

Been to different cities in India, very few place can match up to the steaks and Chelo Kababs served here and specially at that price. Don't go by the rating provided here. Believe me food is awesome. I am a total foodie and I am speaking from my heart. The location is premium. Ambiance is good (not excellent but good).
