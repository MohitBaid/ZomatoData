I ordered fish fries and fish fingers from here and wasn't I awed!!
The fish was fresh,soo soft it almost melted in my mouth,and the fillings were thick;thicker than I have seen at any other eatery.And the skin was so thin,it crumbled in my hands.
Aahh....it filled my soul with bliss;this is what I call 'beautiful' food,:)
Keep it up Petuk,we petuks will keep coming in hordes.

Use code SFOODS to get Rs 100 off on your next ZOMATO online order. (Card payment)

Combos here are worth the try
Egg rice+chilli Chicken 2pc+1 fish finger+salad=79
69 for egg chow/noodles instead of rice

Their chilli Chicken size is too small for satisfaction. It wasn't the same. Previously it was big and value for money as well

Prices increased, side dish size decreases

***Update 13th June 2016*** (rating down from 3.5 to 3.0)
Orders:
3x Moghlai Paratha
1x Chk Fried Momos
The potato side given with Moghlai had the essence.of chlorine. Please check when you buy. It can get u sick.
***Update 20th May 2016***
Ordered
1 Chicken Mixed Fried Rice
1 Chilli Chicken (Schezwan Chicken wasn't available)

Rice (6.5/10) : Good in quantity. Well cooked and has a good mixture of spices in it. Tastes good, very good. It was Mixed F.rice but didn't find much egg and prawns were negligible but smelly. So, 6.5 suits.

Chilli Chicken (7.5/10): Big 8 pieces reasonably priced. Tasted really good. Kono kotha hobe na boss! Total pocket pinch Rs 170 (80+90)

***Update 4th May,2016***
Had Steamed MOMOS(takeaway)
It wasn't ready so they steamed it and made me wait for 20mins. They served fried momos faster than these. The momos were average. Not bad, but much dough.
*Update 27th April, 2016*
Order: Chicken Fried Momo(8 for Rs 50)
They fried up the steamed momos.
The momos were crunchy on the top not the bottom. Tasted Decent, not too good nor bad either. The local momo stalls were closed so gave it a try. At Rs 50, its a decent deal.
Their sauce isn't good.

*24nd April 2016*
My locality. No Ambience, Not for hygiene cautions people.
Fairly priced items, speed of service is moderate. Decent staff behavior.
Orders till date:
Egg Chicken Noodles(7/10)
Chicken Moghlai Paratha(7/10)
Momos(6/10)
Chicken Pakora(8/10)

Egg Chicken noodles have just a decent quantity, with fairly low amount of chicken pieces, they don't always put egg in it, but they charge you equally. Taste is nothing to praise, but decent as per the locality.(Rs 60)

Chicken Moghlai Paratha is good. Comes with potatoes. Well fried, tastes good. Average quantity. (Rs 60)

Chicken Momos(8 for Rs 40): Their taste isn't satisfying, the size is a meagre. The soup looks and tastes really dilute. Not worth spending your money.

Chicken Pakoras:Fairly sized at Rs 10 a piece. Served hot and fresh. Tastes good, worth buying and I buy this the most from this shop this is a good deal.

Just a so-so outlet to prefer eating at. Not so good at hygiene.
