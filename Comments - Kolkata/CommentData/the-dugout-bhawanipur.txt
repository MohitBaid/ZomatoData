Dugout is a very good place to hang out with your friends. The only cafe in town where the food and hookah is amazing. Ambience gets a 5 on 5. The staff here is very warm and friendly.

Went there few days back with my friend. Overall experience was good drink that I order was a lime crusher it tasted good but the crushed ice was blocking the pipe and hookah was also good as I'm not so familiar with hookah but still and the babycorn tasted good couldn't take their pic anyway. Well now come to Ambience first we enter to first floor and I didn't liked that much so we went upstairs. 2nd floor was much better compare to the first decoration and music was all good. I liked the place and would visit again.

I had been to the first floor of the cafe. What I did not like is the hookah bar not having a separate space for  non-smokers. Probably the second floor had that option. Now the positive side is it's located at a very convenient location and the food is quite good. The pricing is reasonable and I liked the Kitkat and Oreo shake along with the Italian Sizzler. The ambience is a bit congested and hence too much smoke all around but the lighting along with the sports screening is quite soothing. The music could have been more soothing. Overall a nice cafe with very amicable and prompt service (They charge 10% service charge for that). The cafe is good but could have been better and there are many other better cafes around.

Visited the place on 25th December this year...Let's talk about the ambience first...the place gives the exact feel of a club..with loud music and dim lights...the table arrangements are extremely good that ensures your privacy...this place pays attention on the details....the staff was extremely good and professional....we had pepper chicken for the starters which was extremely yummy and juicy..next we had scheizwan fried rice with prawn add ons which was also good,nothing excellent..next we had chilli chicken which was extremely sweet for me...for desert we had brownie with chocolate and ice cream which i think was too ordinary for 250 bucks!...the bill was almost 1500rs which i think is quite expensive for the food that was served...if you have no budget and wanna visit a classy place with warm hospitality,you must check it out.

The Dugout located just opposite to Big Fat Belly near Forum Mall is mainly a place famous for Shisha but they have a variety of mouth watering dishes to offer as well.The Mongolian Rice and the Chilli Babycorn remains the highlight and among drinks The Oreo Chocolate Shake is heaven.The Chocolate Pan Cake also remains a highlight.Dugout is offering a special offer now which is very much interesting.According to the temperature of outside you get a flat discount just as the temperature reads which is available till 4 pm in the evening.The ambience is crazy with nice decor and comfort.

Our common hangout adda. The staff are probably the best specializing in hookah, and the food is also amazingly tasty. Being a non vegetarian I was a bit skeptical about the all-veg menu but it has to be the best beg food I've eaten. Pintu Bhai's handmade hookah is the star attraction and the music choice on the second floor is absolutely killing it. 5‚≠ê from my side to THE DUGOUT.

But Can I Eat Something At Dugout They Said No. After That I Visited My Big Fat Belly And I Had My Dinner There. This Was My Horrible Experience At The Dugout, Bhawanipur. Terrible Day Of My Life. I Request The Management That This Does Not Happend Again. Thank you.üò†

-------------
FOOD :
-------------
This place serves some of the best Shishas in kolkata. The TEEN PAAN MINT Hookah (as suggested by the waiter) was really awesome, and is a must try !! On the sides ,we had :

Crispy Chilly Baby Corn - 3/5
Mexican Rice (signature dish) - 3/5
VIrgin Mohito - 3.5/5
Italian Velvet - 4/5

Nothing special about the food, you can't complain either.

Thejr servics is of top notch, and with every waiter being cordial as can be. They will even chnge your seats if you are not satisfied with the current one , something that is rare nowadays.

Overall, highly recommended for people on a decent budget looking for a nice Hookah wala day with pub-like ambience in South Kolkata ..!!

A themed restaurant for all football lovers, conveniently located on Sarat Bose Road with a big board outside so you know you've arrived. It's divided in two floors, where one floor has the proper green grass carpet and round tables with music pumping and a screen with a projector with an ongoing football match.
It's not a kid friendly place due to the hookahs and it serves an all vegetarian fare. The menu has a lot of options, from pizzas to pastas to soothe your craving for Italian food.
I would recommend the three corner pizza with a thin crust with four toppings of your choice and it tastes, well, depends on how you add your toppings.
For starters I tried Potato Wedges and Crispy Chilli Baby corn and both were decent. Not the best in the market, but well prepared and well served and definitely worth a try if you're ever there.
The Green Apple Mojito is also worth a try and its very refreshing.
The Oreo Shake and the Kit Kat Shake may come close to a tie, but for the sweet tooths I'd recommend the Oreo Shake.
It is good if you want to hang out or celebrate a birthday, like I did with my friends and opted for a private room, subject to availability. The staff is polite and offer prompt service. A thumbs up for the Dugout! üëç

My Go-to place whenever i am confused where to go for a hookah with some food. ! üòò
Cons -
1.Theme is wonderful (Sports) and a soothing ambience.
2.Located in a very accessible place in Sarat Bose road, not so far from Forum
3.One of the best hookahs they serve in Kolkata.
4. Value for money.
5. Organise sometimes Karaoke nights, which i absolutely love it with my gang.

P. S. - *I didn't find any cons yet.üòã

Visited this place with cousin after doshomi. This place is easy to locate in bhowanipur area. We were lucky enough that we did not have waited in the queue. We get a seat on the 3rd floor. The ambience is pretty awesome. If you looking for hookah and wanna hangout with your friends, from my suggestion this place should have been in your list. We order two hookah, 4 mocktals,2 smoothy, veg cheese ball,and pizza also. 1st of all you have to keep it mind that it is a veg caf√©. Now come to the food the cocktails were good and smoothy were up to the mark. Cheese balls were average and the pizzas were very bad. So in case of ordering any food in your own risk think first. The staff were very polite and helpful too.overall good experience. Good place for hangout.

It is located at a prime place on Sarat Bose Road,very near to Jai Hind Dhaba and just opposite to My Big Fat Belly. This place is divided into two sections and we went to the second floor where the arrangement is kind of a lounge with really upbeat music and amazing lighting. After some time they had turned on the UV lights and everything looked very cool and fascinating. This place also features a play station and large screens for live sports which makes it all the more alluring.
Coming to the food, everything on the menu is vegetarian. We had ordered Chilli Garlic Fried Rice, Paneer pizza and fried ice cream. The rice and the pizza were served quickly and was quite delectable.The quantity was fine for two. We had to cancel the order placed for the fried ice cream as it was taking a lot of time to serve and it was already very late.
Overall it's a pretty chill place to hangout with friends with amazing ambience and awesome sheesha.

First up , it is to be noted that all items on the menu are vegetarian. But let it not sway you away because this is one of the few places who are able to maintain a standard in food along with serving hookah 

I have been here couple of times and the staff here is quite courteous. 

Food: Try the french fries , Onion rings , potato wedges - its really good 

Pizzas : they do a good job with the thin crust pizzas and you would be pleasantly surprised if you do try them. Infact that prepare these clever non-vegetarianesque pizzas with vegetarian pepporoni and sausage ( honestly never understood how they prepare vegetarian pepporoni- but they say it's vegetarian)

My winner - herb rice with potato jacket in curry ..umm it's very good.

Last but not the least Hookah can be customised to one's need and want. If you want something string they will churn it up for you and at the same time if you want something mild they can do that too. I liked the paan with redbull base.

This place is pretty cool with all the lighting, the superb music system and the ambiance. It's located on Sarat Bose Road near Jai Hind Dhaba, and is quite noticeable. We went to the 2nd floor, where it's kind of a lounge. We ordered a Four Topping Pizza and Chilli Garlic Fried Rice. Both the dishes were pretty well cooked. At one point of time, they turned all the lights off and switched on only the UV lights. Everything looked pretty cool out there. All the light-coloured stuff were glowing. It was overall a very good experience there.

A gem of a place The Dugout is in terms of food, and ambience. However the staff attending us, seemed a bit disinterested and reluctant for which I would definitely not give the place 5-stars, and deduct 1 out of it. Being a friend's birthday we were carrying a cake and had asked the staff to keep the same in the refrigerator for the time being. However we noticed that the staff took the cake from us and kept it on a shelf, and it stayed on the shelf until we requested them to bring it back. We had to constantly ask them for small things, such as to serve plates and fork as they did not provide us with the same with the cakes, for extra straws even after we had said them to provide it while ordering, we even had to ask for water and then for glasses when only a bottle was served. I'm really disappointed with the service, we even had to ask them to serve us food as the person had just kept the bowl of babycorn and left. But however the food here, tastes amazing. It is mouth watering. We had ordered a variety of dishes all of which were yummy. Sweet corn soup, crispy chilli babycorn, italian sizzler, schezwan rice, blue mojito, oreo shake, every dish tasted good.

The Dugout is a place for loud people and this one of the reason I couldn't sit there for long.

I went there along with a friend of mine and found that couldn't carry on with conversation because eevrything there was loud - People, TV, Sound System.

However it is to be mentioned that, the service was really very good and so was the service persons.

I ordered for a Masala Chai which was okay and a Cheese Sandwich which was delightful.

An okayish visit.

My rating is primarily on the ambiance. It is so loud that even deaf can hear the music and people with hearing ability will definitely go deaf. Wanted to rush out as fast as possible so tried only the hookah and a mocktail. Both were just ok. What disappointed me further is that after placing the hookah they struggled to provide the nozzle even after asking for it repeatedly. Lastly what was given didn't fit-in so had to wait for another few minutes until they succeeded to bring one.
I don't have the guts to again go there to try their other dishes.

A small, cosy place to hangout with friends or family . The menu consists of mostly snacks and options of sandwiches. Taste wise, I would rate a 3/5. Their veg platter is one of my favourites, and also quite filling portion wise. Overall experience is good.

I am a non vegetarian and this place is pure veg. But I didn't miss chicken much. Cuz the food is awesome. Be it pizza or crispy Baby corn or fried rice or mojito .. staff is attentive and courteous.  It's close to my house and surprisingly I missed it all the time.  One of the best places in lansdown Sarat bose road . Keep it up !  Ambience is nice as well.  Good music is a plus

Firstly, it's located at a prime place. It's looks really good from outside as well.

As you enter you have this really good feeling because the ambience is amazing! The staff are helpful and efficient. The Dugout has got under the skin of its theme and exhibits a perfect match viewing experience and serves a great deal of finger food and other variants as well.
The service is good, though slow. Food is also great, do try their crispy babycorn. Do not try jacketed potato and daab sikanjee, they are awfull. Mexican rice and garlic bread is great. 

come in whenever you want to see a match with buddies and leave the job to fullfil your taste buds to them

Dugout is my favourite hangout spot in Kolkata‚Äã..it has these two sections... either relax downstairs with warm music or chill upstairs with some really upbeat music. they got board games downstairs and xbox upstairs. overall theme is cool and for both sections food is great hookah is great and the staff is the coolest and friendliest you'll ever find.

A terrible place to spend a chilled out evening,staffs are unprofessional and arrogant.
Dont dare go their with any close one as they will harass you with their eyes and cheap comments.
Playing Good songs and serving Good Hookah does not make a Cafe great,look at the professionalism,food quality and ambience too.
I will never go to this place again and request sensible people to stay away from this shitty place
Oh Yes,food was horrible too,even i dont know how i landed up at a huge bill without even ordering hookah but just little food.

This place is quite easily accessible near lake kalibari..
This is the 2nd outlet of dugout.. This place was in my wishlist for a long time but happened to visit it today.. specially well known for hookah.. but we went there to have some adda and food...

Ambience :- As soon as you enter the place you will be amazed.. The dim lights.. soft big semi round cushions... big projector playing loud music.. A percent mood setter...

Food :- we ordered a blue lagoon.. It was as usual very refreshing but I felt it was a bit more lemony.. (4/5)

Dugout special pizza :- Again not so extraordinary.. I have had better pizzas in kolkata... again a (3.5/5)

Veg club sandwich :- The best food among the three... It came with a peanut sauce.. loaded with cheese and veggies... A lipsmacking dish .. (5/5) Recommended

They don't charge any GST or service charge...
So won't burn a hole in your pocket too...

Overall if you want to spend some good tym with you bae or frnds... and enjoy some electrifying atmosphere... This is the place for you...

For hukka and flavours, pintu da. He plays with it well and bring on the new heterogenous mix. Any complaints, they deal with good smile. 
Thats what you look in for any cafe or restro. 
Blissfull experience, over a year, a regular customer. Try if you are unsure.

For the food - a thumbs up. Be it anything, you can give it a try atleast once but the best was mexican rice with jack potatoe. It is one of the best dish being served here. 
Overall the experience was 'fantastic'

I visited this place quite some time back with a large group.
The ambience is quite groovy with dim lights, loud music and a giant tv showing live sports screening.
Coming to the food we ordered-
1. Chocolate shake with ice cream
2. Kit kat shake
3. Exotic cheese balls
4. Crispy fried baby corn
5. Crispy fried mushroom
6. Stuffed pizza
7. Pasta
8. Corn cheese cake
9. Sizzlers.

Although the food is veg, it was really good and the quantity was enough as well.
One drawback is they serve the food a bit late. So this gives u a lot of time to catch up on all the gossip with your friend!

Second home to us since the last 3 years. No matter how many hookah zones and cafes have come and gone in bhawanipur but this one has been one of a kind. A sports themed Cafe : The Dugout is the best place to hangout.
Thumbs up for it's collection of music.
To it's dark decor and ambience
Affordable and finger licking food with great signature dishes
And last but not the least: the fantastic service..by Ashish & the team at dugout.
This is the best among the 3 dugouts.

The Dugout which is at a stone thrown distance from Jai Hind Dhaba and pretty well connected to Chakerberia Road just opposite to My Big Fat Belly.

It has great ambiance for Hookah and even Non-Hookah zone. This place has the best hookah in the Kolkata, I ever had. Nowadays, parents even here visiting with there children as there's private room for these people. And the best part of this sports cafe is there friendly staff. If you visit alone then also they won't make you feel lonely . There's also play station and few more good games to play.
There food menu is pretty good to have, my favorite are Mexican Rice , Fruit Salad , Maggie and Chai(BEST) for sure.
HOOKAH LOVER MUST VISIT THIS SPORTS CAFE.

First of all it has a great ambience complemented by good quality food. Its a must for teenage groups. 
The food here is great and the price is reasonable. Lemon mint crusher is a must for me and I just love it. 
But the staff service is on the slower side. It can be improved. And its not very big a deal specifically coz people go their to hang out. So all in all a good place with nice drinks. 
It's definitely recommended for everyone. Will go their again.

Been here just once . Loved the decor . Amazed by the interiors .

We were there just for about 45 odd minutes so couldn't really have everything what our bellies was craving for .

We ordered a pan rasna sheesha and were blown away . It was the best hookah ever .

The Alfredo Pasta was very good but Pasta in Spinach Sauce was just mind-blowing.

I didn't like their sandwiches - neither the veg club nor the cheese sandwich. 

We also had a mocktail - Kiwi Cinderella which was awesome . 


Overall this place is very nice and I would like to visit soon to taste some other dishes from the vast menu .

To begin with, ambience of place is extremely apt for the name it has. Food is extremely good and the plus point about it is that the quantity does justice to the prices. Two different sections and small private section caters to different moods of people. They have a variety of board games and a play station to spend time with your companions.
Hospitality of the outlet is a very rare find in the city.
In short, a place where ambience, crowd, music and food is good and does not compromise on the quality of any aspects and it is open till 1-2 AM.

It's a cafe build for sports enthusiasts but the actual ambiance is of middle-aged couples who are looking for a place to park themselves for a long evening. Now coming to the food , it's severely overpriced. Although the average price for two people says 800 but the food is not worth the amount. There are places in this very hood of similar budget and better food.

Firstly, it's located at a prime place. It's looks really good from outside as well.
As you enter you have this really good feeling because the ambience is amazing! The staff are helpful and efficient. The service can be made a bit more prompt. The hookah is darn good with a whole lot of variety. The food is really good and the quantity is okay as well. The crowd and the vibe is on point. 
Aesthetically pleasing and tasty food! You'll be visiting this place again, and again.

The restaurant has really good decor and ambience but I found it expensive. The food quantity was very less and it tasted average, nothing special. Staff is courteous but extra amount is charged for water which is a huge disappointment for me. Also some extra kind of tax was also taken apart from the usual VAT and service tax. Go if you you want to enjoy a good match of cricket with some hookah.

The staffs are attentive and very cordial. The food is nothing extraordinary here, but they won't disappoint you either. Try their crispy chilli mushroom, crispy chilli baby corn, four topping pizza, cold coffee and virgin mojito. Overall a good place to go and chill over some coffee and hookah üëçüèº

Worst service ever faced...If You want to serve only the customer you know then start membership .......and don't allow others....We were 4 recommended by our friend....We ordered Teen paan (the only thing which was good ). Others we Ordered were hakka noodles which was not cooked well and that too after 20 min after order. Next we ordered cheese garlic bread which came after 30 more min. Thanks to person in charge who said Sir time to lagega...After this when we asked for the track to be played we were down again.......But we saw other wish were fulfilled.....Worst experience..........

I have been to this place on a Monday afternoon and to my astonishment, it was very lively. It was of two floors. We were there for 1 hour in the first floor after which we shifted to the upper floor. I really liked the ambience of this place.We had ordered
1)White sauce pasta (The dish was very well prepared)
2)Mixed sauce pasta (I loved it after adding some spices)
3) Garlic bread ( This one was just like other caf√©s that you get.)
4) Crispy chilly baby corn ( The baby corn was crispy and well prepared.)
5)Oreo shake ( It was ok ok. The taste could have been better.)
6) Virgin Mojito ( This one is a must try drink. I thoroughly loved the presentation.)
7)Pineapple Fantasy ( This drink was very spicy and there wasn't any taste of pineapple. We asked the staff if it was the one we had ordered and they agreed. But to my disappointment it did not match it's name.)
Our cost came to be around 2100 which was okay.
Over and above a great place to hangout with your friends.

Dugout special hookah was awesome ; and also taken brain rassela ( strong hookah) best in its category. Sizzlers are must try... And veg platter was awesome, specially the chesse balls and garlic bread.... We were total 6 persons so including all this the bill was Rs 1642. So it went quite pocket friendly ( around 250 per person) . Also live match was streaming so it was quite fun place to hangout with your friends.

Never imagined the special ambience the management would create for us at the wee hours of the morning. Special ambience, excellent quality of mocktails and shakes, one kick ass pizza among other delicacies. Not to mention the hookah with a great concoction!

We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and look forward to coming here again.

Some places are to be visited regularly, this is one of them, over the years new places have errupt up, but this hasn't lost its sign. The lounge is still the first choice for sports lovers and special for screening of any game.

The service is good, though slow. Food is also great, do try their crispy babycorn. Do not try jacketed potato and daab sikanjee, they are awfull. Mexican rice and garlic bread is great. 

Drop in whenever you wanna see a match with buddies and leave the job to fullfil your taste buds to them

Try their new unique puchka...the presentation is a visual treat..the authentic puchka comes with two loaded injections flavoured with two types of chutneys.. and the testubes rest in a bowl of iced blue lagoon...the potato mash in the mini pressure cookers add to the cuteness of the entire frame... combine all elements and the taste is good...enjoyed it..they would soon be adding dry ice to enhance the look..
Dugout has always been my comfort place..the ambience is amazing and the staff has always been friendly...keep reinventing @Dugout and will be back soon !!

The ambience of this place is it's greatest plus point with cherry red sofas,dim lighting and live sports screening which quite efficiently compliments the name.Coming to the food,they serve only veg items which are suffuciently good.We went in a group and ordered for chocolate milk shake with icecream,cheese balls,cheese corn cake,chilli paneer,Pasta,stuffed pizza,creamy mushroom.All the items were quite tasty and sufficient in quantity.Only one thing that they serve you very late after you order and this is the reason for not giving that 0.5 star.Else this place is amazing to hang out with friends.They also serve hooka which I didn't try last time but will surely do the next time I visit.

The Dugout has been the premier sports lounge of the city for the past few years and it becomes quite evident when you have to reach early to get your seats.
The Dugout has got under the skin of its theme and exhibits a perfect match viewing experience and serves a great deal of finger food and other variants as well.
We had the following-
1-Crispy Chili Babycorn- It was nice but the quantity was surprisingly poor.
2- Cheese Fondue- The sauce was amazing and worth a try.
3- Watermelon Mojito- The soda and herbs completely expunged the watermelon flavour, nothing like "Watermelon mojito". The same goes with Kiwi Cinderella, which was equally disappointing.
4- The Veg Platter- This is an excellent deal which goes perfectly with a sporting event. French fries,cheese balls,nachos and garlic bread! *Burp*
5- Lastly,we had the Chef Special pizza which is a winner and easily the best item we had!

Prices are competitive but the small quantity negates the same. Service is surprisingly fast even for a crowded Sunday affair.The mockatils were a big thumbs down and they could pour in a little effort to make the presentation neat.

PS- Do avail the offer where they give a dish for Rs 99 only during match hours!

But when I entered‚Äã the 2nd floor, i just was surprised by the ambience, with wall carvings of famous artists and big tv screens (where we watches ipl match), seating sofas as big as you want, and the lighting.
We ordered stuffed pizza which was really great(wish we were here first) and a hookah joint coz well birthday boy..
Cut my cake and the staff was really good, they even switched to a birthday song on the tv when i was cutting the cake üòâüòú

Nice ambience.. good food but i felt the price is quite high as compared to the quantity served.. and also the price is not same as in the zomato menu.. 50 rs is added in the price list (as avaiable in zomato) of each item.. and even after that, they charge tax.. we had a bill rs 808.. which after adding tax went upto 928.. (not to forget, this is the amount after rs 121 being deducted as discount)!

This place opens at 8am in the morning and closes at 10pm. There's nothing low about this place. Must visit for foodies and hookah lovers! Cheers!

Had an awesome experience at Dugout. The place is a perfect place to hangout with friends. The ambience is amazing if you're not looking for a quiet place. Coming to the food, it was great! Imo not all Hookah Bars serve good food so this was a pleasant surprise. The food in general is tasty. Do try the Mongolian Rice and Brownie Shake. Chocolate Pancakes were not the best you would get in town, but definitely worth the money!

This place is everything a youth lounge would want to be. The longlasting hookahs and mouth watering dishes make it d best. The ambience is the coolest in the city and the crowd is awesome. Karaoke night to chaar chaand laga dete h yaar. From friendly staff members to being the first sports themed parlour, this place is all about class. Love to visit this place everytime.

To put it bluntly, I simply dug Dugout. I went on a Saturday morning, and as expected, breakfast time there isn't crowded. There were 2 of us, but I was the only person interested in eating, so all we ordered was a veg platter. The platter comprised of nachos, fries, cheese toast and cheese balls, and they had 2 dips to go with it. Each of the items were good, and be something I'd order individually ( although I'd be skeptical on the quantity in that case). The platter is sufficient to fill 1 person, and it was reasonably priced as well. 
As for the ambiance, the decor was good and the music was to my taste. So all in all, a place to revisit, best during evenings however.

Let's start by saying I don't get the hookah craze which is severely unhealthy and was glad that they were not serving hookah here today. Kolkata is one of the most polluted cities in the world and plunging your lungs with more smoke is not enviable. 
This place has the best vegetarian food I have had in a while. The tomato basil soup and the manchow soup was excellent. As was the crispy baby corn and Mexican rice with jacket potatoes. The interiors are lovely and spacious and very modern. The sound system is state of the earth. Lovely place to party with the gang.

Best place for chilling out. They serve the best shisha. The shisha here really lasts long. Music is really loud. I visit here during IPL & ICL. The screen is too big to watch cricket match sitting infront of a projected screen wid unknown people on the same cafe shouting loud for a boundary with a strong hookah in front. Thumbs up for long lasting memories, delicious pizza, loud music & virat kohli.

I had heard a lot about this Football themed sports cafe with great food and Shisha. Alas, I happened to visit here when there wasnt any match to be screened. Nonetheless, I loved how they had tried to give it a football theme indeed. Red and Green tables with dark ceiling, having footballs & names of famous players carved from light. The also have a huge screen on projector along with few other TV screens so that you have a good look at the screen no matter where you sit.
We ordered Paan flavored Shisha along with Cheese Nachos, Dugout special Pizza, Veg Manchurian and Chinese Bhel. The shisha was good, really good! But what I didn't like was the food. 
Cheese Nachos - simple tortilla crisps with a meagre amount of cheese sprinkled on them. Served with the side of salsa and cheese sauces. This was really disappointing and bland! If not anything else, at least should have given a lot more cheese sauce!
Dugout Special Pizza - found nothing particularly special except for the numerous toppings. Should have been more saucy or cheezy. Also, we asked for oregano and chilli flakes which the attendant went to fetch but never returned. So nothing spectacular with the pizza.
Veg Manchurian (dry) - these tasted good, but the quantity was so less I wondered if they had accidentally given us half a portion. 
Chinese Bhel - this was one dish which lived up to the expectations. Nice and tangy and crisp

Also, another problem was that the food took way too much time to arrive. So it is better you place all your order at once rather than one after the other... otherwise you'll end up waiting really long between orders!

The music and videos being played were good and loud. I can imagine how fun it must be to watch a match here. Hopefully I can, the next time!

There were 6 of us. We literally fell in love with the place as soon as we entered it.
The music, the ambience, the staff.
We ordered a a couple of Hookas and some snacks. The food was good but the ambience and the service stole the show.
Looking forward to visit this place soon.

This place is always buzzing with crowd and good music! The interior is very innovative with football style floor lightings and grassy floors.. This is the best place for the youngsters and college goers. They had also installed a karaoke set on our last visit and were working on some technical issues. . They are also famous for live screening of sports in big projectors! 
Coming to food- they serve finger licking food in good quantity and pricing is fairly fone!
We have tried mexican rice with jacket potato, crispy chillie babycorn and penne in white sauce!  
Mexican rice with jacket potato was really good (a must try)
Pasta was cheesy and hot with fresh veggies in it and was flavourful! 
Overall an energetic place with good food and hookah!

Food is high priced, and not so tasty. Also, the staffs are not well-mannered. Even tries to cheat you. Exhibit - (We went in a group of 10 to watch El Clasico. Cover Charge was 500 per person. When we were engrossed in the match, one waiter informed us that we have ordered for Rs 5000 and asked for the payment. I asked for the bill, which they were trying to avoid. On my persistence, they showed me the bill, which mounted to only 3900. On being asked about it, they said that  we were supposed to pay 5000 only, so they are nowhere wrong) 

2.0 rating is for the awesome ambiance and sports environment.

Lip smacking food served with pipped music!

This vegetarian delight of a cafe is superb for sports fanatics. But those who are looking for a great evening complete with shisha and veg food, this is the place to be.

The veg menu is superb. We didn't tried the shisha though so can't comment.

For the starters, we had gone for the cheese fondue, watermelon mojito, daab shikanji, virgin mojito and mixed sauce pasta. Cheese fondue was way too cheesy, just the way I like it. Main course followed with burnt garlic fried rice (which wasn't in the menu, but they prepared it on my request) with manchurian, margarita pizza, and quesidillas. Rice was above par whereas the pizza lacked taste. Quesidillas were very sweet, didn't like it.

A good evening spent altogether. Will drop in again.

They play really good tracks. :')
You get a slight small of strawberry hookah constantly..that's ;-)
The staff are co-operative. :) 
But I was a bit disappointed with the food. 
The blue lagoon mocktail had excess mint leaves in it and that completely destroyed its taste. The mint should be added in such a quantity that it has an aesthetic appeal...and not so much that it makes blue lagoon- virgin mojito.
The pizza had nice taste..but was very chewy.

Hookha was good but chocking a little bit... black mojito was very good... pineapple fantasy was on the spicer side and it was awesome... the rest two was very sweet didn't like it at all... the ambience was pretty good... the deco of the 2nd floor is very attractive but the 1st floor is not so well made... sitting was very comfortable...

One of the best cafe in the town for delicious food..Probably a place you will enjoy everything completely...they serve you the best Shisha in different exoitic flavours..We ordered mixed sauce pasta and nachoes which tasted amazing don't miss out Pinacollada (Just amazingüòã)...The best part of the place..it has two seprate floors a light environment for those who prefer silence..and a dark environment with loud music..for those who prefer that...There is life screening of sports during matches..Over all a decent place to visit for fun in group..I had been to most of the Cafes in the city...But for dugout m always IN üòâ..!!

this place has been my personal favorite for a cafe situated in the south side, since quite a long time.

the 1st floor of the cafe has nice sporty interiors, Though once again the football shaped False ceiling has completely been copied by One Sports lounge.. This is Y i guess interior designers should be chosen carefully.¬†

but non the less... this place offers very prompt service, the food is actually quite good
the mixed sauce pasta was perfectly prepared, the for toppings pizza was very nice too..

the the Hookha was superb! it lasted long even after a coal change..
so definitely i will keep coming back to this place.

Dugout has been my personal favorite since quite a long time. I had visited it on 13th August, 2016. One of my friend had come from Pune for a weekend and we decided to hit this place late in the night. At night, the ambiance of this place is totally different compared to the usual day times. The best part is the EDM which they play. Be it the service or the hospitality, they are really good at it. All the staffs as well as manager is quite down to earth which does make me keep coming back again. Nevertheless, we were four people and as it was jam packed, we were made to sit in the party section inside (1st Floor). However, after sometime, we somehow managed to get a seat in the main section on the 1nd Floor. We were a little high and EDM was an icing on the cake. I really like the glowing red football curved design on the ceiling which adds to the overall look of the place. They have a large projector screen with a PS4 to satiate our gaming experience.
                                                                ...

Located in Bhowanipur, this caf√© is known for their sporty interiors.

Fun and chilled out ambience, quirky d√©cor and warm service is the USP.

We had ordered hookah along with chili garlic noodles and cheese fondue. 

Hookah was nice and smooth.

I loved the noodles and the cheese fondue was good as well.

Pocket pinch is reasonable!

I went there with a friend of mine, approximately close to 10pm. We first sat at the first floor cause the second floor was full. We ordered for a chocolate shake, fresh lime soda sweet, veg platter and garlic bread pizza. Along with candy hookah. The food really did not seem to impress us, espcially me, cause i am a culinary student so i thought the food lacked behind a bit. Everything else was good. The service was up to the mark. The ambience was nice. Overall i enjoyed it. Will visit soon.

Though this place is a famous hookah parlour in the city, let me tell you, it serves excellent food. Personally I am a huge fan of the Mexican rice they serve here with a potato side dish. Also tried the mixed sauce pasta and the platter, which was equally good.
Overall ambience is decent. I always prefer the room that's separate from the main lounge.
Service is good. :)

Well the review is about my two visit @ the Dugout stay tuned for the con( I didn't expect it). Trust me its a superb lounge. We had strong hukkah's. Teen Pan flavour was awesome but brain freezer tore my brain apart. Lol!! Yes brain freezer is indeed a strong flavour. Its a budget friendly lounge with awesome food. Now this is what I didn't expect. My girlfriend she kissed me and trust me guys a staff member came in saying " its a public place and maintain your self". I didn't know how to react to that as what I feel even kissing in public is not an offence in India. It was just a kiss which even didn't last for two second. I was disappointed on that staff, rest all is fine .

The best thing about The Dugout is itself The Dugout. People over there are like family. Its location is convinient and it has the best ambience till now, for me at least.

I really like their food, not being a person who takes hookah i still visit this place for their food. Their Mexican rice with jacket potato is my favorite. Rest of the menu is like any other cafe, but the quality of food is good

A great place to chill and hangout or may be catch up ur favourite match. This place is full of sports theme and is done quite well, the food is awesome and so is the sheesha. I got my hands on the ps4 which made the whole experience much better. Definitely worth a visit. My favourite : sweet chilly paneer , onion rings .

Located at Sarat Bose Road alongside popular peers like Desi Draaag, Dugout has managed to outrun all its competitors and has turned out to be one of the best hangout places for students and Calcutta's youth. The location is pretty convenient. Upon reaching there, we ordered a Pasta Alfredo (tossed with vegetables and white sauce), Veg Platter, Green Apple Soda and KitKat shake. I couldn't find any flaw in any of the things mentioned above. The pasta and KitKat shake really stood out.
One commendable thing about this place is that you will find it crowded every time you visit it and yet the staff will ensure that you get proper attention. We were seated inside the private lounge on the second floor and there the music was amazing. Would love to visit this place again for its ambience.

You have number of options in Kolkata now for late night hookah and food. And this one is not just 'one of them'. Open till late in the night is a big positive. Although that's not the only factor to be considered. The food is good as well and the service is quick and nice. Seating is very comfortable and the overall ambience with a theme around sports does not disappoint either. The only thing that could disappoint some of my Frens is that this is a pure veg place. Else, definitely worth a visit!

Food was good enough for us to keep visiting this place, the shisha hasn't ever been disappointing. The interiors are good, with a huge projector one the second floor.

A football-themed hookah lounge spread over two floors, The Dugout is a perfect place for a hangout. The top floor is a greater attraction than the one below it, for the giant screen and a ceiling with names of sportsmen carved on it sure to grab some eyeballs. The music was slightly loud in my opinion, giving it more of a club-like feel.  
Although this place has diverse vegetarian offerings, me and my friend chose to stick to their special pizza preparation to go with Choco Fizz. Hookah was neat and strong.
It's a shame my first visit to this place happened a couple of days before. It would have really been a boon if they served alcohol here, given the set up and ambience of the place. Nevertheless, this place is a haven for shisha lovers and if you can find room on the top floor, you're in for a treat.

A very nice hangout place for a group. The location is very easy to find. It is divided into two floors, with a lively ambience on one floor (ideal for chitchat and boardgames etc.) and a very energetic ambience on the other (dim lit, loud music, live screenings).

The hookah and food is more than decent. We had pasta garlic bread and kitkat shake. Thumbs up for both variety and quality.

The staff is very welcoming. It was raining heavily and the security guard came up to our cab to receive us with an umbrella and greeted us.

Overall, a good place to try out with friends for a casual outing.

With its eye catching interiors, amazing hookah and great music, The Dugout has to be one of the most happening lounges in Kolkata. As soon as you enter, you'll catch sight of the gold staircase, which itself gives a very classy impression about the place. The building is two tiered, although I would suggest to go to the upper floor cause it has better ambience and better privacy.
The ground floor has a black and white look. Quite bright with soft music. More or less quiet ambience. The top floor has a large hall with classy red coloured couches, very dimly lit with only the light from the decor on the ceiling. Large screen. Great playlist. Live screening of IPL. A very vibrant and electrifying ambience within a crowd of youngsters. Their theme is sports...particularly football I think.
Coming to the hookah, its one of the best I have tried. Very smooth and long lasting.
Food is good enough, both taste and quantity wise.
Its a bit on the costly side(service tax, service charge, VAT and all that makes it costly). We had ordered for just 1 hookah(Shahi paan grape mint with coal change) and 1 pasta and they charged us around 750 bucks! But yeah, the amazing ambience made up for it.
Now about the staff, they're very friendly, welcoming and with that happy-to-help kind of attitude. Service is good.
Altogether, The Dugout is truly worth a visit.

Visited this place sometime back for my friend's birthday üéÇ.. It was a nice experience and a very good for him because he was new to kolkata. He was totally over joyed by the whole staff singing the birthday song for him. The hokkah was very good and the mexican rice was just so amazing that we ordered 4 plates in between 3 people. The other items like a particular shake ( don't remember the exact name) was also very good. Overall a very nice place to hangout especially if you are a football lover.  The ambience is just so good for the football lover. 

A very good place. Keep the good work going.

Love hookah but most places are too dingy? Look no further. The Dugout has the best hookah scene is town. Two tiered building, with spacious rooms and large screen TVs screens showing live matches. You don't need more reasons to drop by this place.

*food quality: 3.5/5
*food quantity: 4/5
*staff: 2/5
*service: 1/5
*ambience: 5/5

Location: located at Bhawanipur, a few minutes walk from Pirates Deck. 

Food and hookah: the Dugout known for its smooth working hookah definitely lives up to its name. Hookah so smooth you'd slip into what you call you being high. Bad joke? But I swear, the hookah isn't.

Food here is pretty decent too.
Thupka: Clear soup accompanied by noodles, drowned in corn and cabbage making a flavorful broth. Hearty and filling. All in all, tastes pretty good. (3.5/5)

Management: now here's the downer. The staff here frankly speaking, takes their job way too lightly. Shiny caf√© with big TV screen are pull factors, but a staff team as poorly trained as them alone ruins the experience. I normally do not go into details about these things, but allow me to point out how my friends and I were forced to wait for over an hour to receive our bowl of Thupka. First of all, our table was dirty, but none of the waiters cared to come clean it. Happens to the best of us. Let's overlook that, shall we? Next, we order our Thupka. A waiter took down the order and left. We waited and waited just to watch newly arriving customers coming, receiving their orders and leaving. This continued for over an hour. Meanwhile, our dirty table was still untouched and were not taken care of. Let's also keep in mind that there were repeated reminders and requests from our side to get our order a bit faster. Later we came to knew that our order was never written down in the first place. I believe this kind of laid back attitude does not really give the customers a happy experience.

It is one of the most happening and craziest place of Kolkata now a days. U can hardly get a space on weekends in the late hours. The upper floor of the cafe has the best ambience. And the lower floor features a classic lounge ambience. The place is very famous for its match screenings. They provide you the best shisha you could have ever had.  The food is also amazing from its French fries to cheesy garlic bread from white sauce pasta to risotto everything is very delicious. A visit to this cafe is a must for everyone.

You'll find this place to your left if you go towards Minto Park.The interiors have been done up properly keeping in mind the theme of the place.The volume of the music playing in the background is tuned to perfection and it doesn't sound too loud ever. The staff is courteous and quick to respond.
The hookah is  smoky, smooth and long lasting. Food is good and the serving is quite generous so you might want to take the server's advice while ordering. Overall a decent place to go with your buddies to catch a game of football over good food and hookah.

The Dugout - one of those places that tops our list to visit and chill out.
Located in Bhawanipore.

Had been there several times with my group. Hookah is the must-order here and even more compulsory when the group has it's majority. 
The ambience is just perfect that a Hookah Parlour should be. It has the minimum number of lights put on, so apt for the thing.
Plays superb music and even you can watch matches or videos being played on. 
They have gaming sections too. Good for the gamers. 
Staffs are just so good and helpful. (We had been there for a birthday party once and they had played birthday song for us  - just an instance)
Food quality is perfect and good in terms of quantity. Prices are reasonable.
(Oh ! I love the Pasta with White sauce here)
The kitkat shake could be made better with the things crushed more and mixed well.

It's doing great. So bang on ! 
(Keep a note on the kitkat shake next time. Okay :P)

A happening place to be present at, in the Bhawanipur area, the Dugout will right away impress you as soon as you enter. The selfie staircase is gold (hats off to whoever came up with that idea!). This place has two floors, hookah and non hookah. The floor offering hookah has an electrifying ambiance and you cannot help but be all awestruck. Big screen, great music choice, privacy at every table. Last I checked, the crowd surprised me a little (oldies present, not regulars likely to be seen at such joints). Anyhow, I love the Mexican Rice they serve here. Drinks are okay, nothing great. Decent service too. Pocket pinch - Around 2k for 4 people. 
I just got news about this new fortune cookie thing here. Visiting soon!! (Fortune cookies in Kolkata, very rare. Just fyi.)

Okay,so I was here on the 1st of January 2016. The location is pretty accessible from across the city because it is ideally situated on the Bhawanipore street. I have to say, that this place has nice ambience. It feels like home . Primarily a choice for hookah lovers, this place also has a sumptuous menu for foodies. I wasn't excited in the beginning but the spicy cottage cheese sizzler is mouthwatering. Not to forget, the music played there is very recent to this day and time. They have nice sense of  both western and Bollywood music. One thing to complain is the loo, the bathroom is way far from the cozy environment of the building.

One of the most happening cafes located in south kolkata near bhawanipur.The moment you enter it the ambience attracts you because of their selfiestaircase.Everyone visiting The Dugout cant stop themselves from getting clicked in  their staircase because of the electrifying ambience.
Its a hookah parlour with one of the best food served in any of the cafes and hookahparlours around kolkata.A plus point of this place is this is a pure vegetarian cafe.
Coming to the food their Pasta,Garlic bread,
Rosti,Mexican rice,Babycorn all are mind blasting.
Famous for its hookah this is one of our favourite places..

A pretty awesome place to satisfy your need for a Hookah! Has a very comfortable ambience and those RED lights! ‚ù§Ô∏è
The food was cheaper compared to other Hookah parlours in that area. Tastes good. Quantity was satisfying. 
This place is definitely worth every buck. 

The only thorn in the rose was that they charged a bottle of water extra which wasn't even consumed. 
So I'd recommend checking your bill just to be safe! üòâ

This place is close to my office, hence i keep frequenting it often.
There are two floors. If you wish to have a cozy seating with less noise, the first floor would be ideal.. Low couches and window side seats are nice and comfortable. 
The 2nd floor is the floor where you must go if you have a big group of friends, with led lighting, wide screen match view and loud music, this place lofts up spirits.

Hookah is good. Food is also quite good. A happy place. 
Shall i go there again? Of course!

The light arrangements are nice & they gleamed with delight, complementing the energetic atmosphere of the place . The hookahs are good. They allow you to try combination of two or three flavours with a good material as the base substance. We tried 3 flavours. The 3rd one was pan supari flavour with daab base and that one truly blew our mind. This sports themed cafe will definitely bring a energetic vibe to you. The only negative thing about the place is it's music selection, its awful. Sanam puri with his "duaa" didn't really go well with the environment.

Nice place to hangout with friends and let yourself relax amidst the sports themed d√©cor. The Hookah they serve out here is good as they allow you to try combo of two flavours. We tried out Kiwi-Gum and RoyalPanMasala-Mint; although the 1st one was good the 2nd one was ok type. We also had thin-crust Veg Delight pizza which was good considering the fresh toppings and the lasting taste. The drinks were a bit disappointing: while the Lemon Ice Tea was alright their Special Crusher was not so desirable having too much of a flavour of Strawberry Shake. Anyway the music and ambience is nice and it's a good cafe to chill out.

A good place to hang out with friends over few chips ands sandwiches and gossip. The only cons about the place is that its a veg zone so thats the only bad thing from non veg loving people like us. But apar from that its a perfect chillout zone

I got a purple rain mocktail which I loved, and they gave my fianc√© a complimentary mocktail as it was his birthday. Service is very prompt, staff are courteous and helpful. Nice place to hang out, watch a game and have a hookah. If the lighting was a bit more subdued, it would be the ideal place to unwind and sit for hours.

Located in sarat bose road, this sport themed hookah parlour is more style than substance. The interiors give you the vibe of a sport parlour. The music played is good. Sports is being constantly played on the huge tv sets installed. However, the food is not upto the mark. Hookah was not great either. The staff will constantly nag you and they want you gone ASAP, which to be honest, is a big turn off. I have been there twice and didn't have a good time. Better places to go within walking distance within the same budget.

Recently relocated to kolkata and there was a lot hype about this place. Expectations came crashing down on just entering the place. Except hookah, nothing was special or something which makes you go WOW! I still have no clue why people are going bonkers over this place. Kolkata deserves better sports bars.

I came to this place with a bunch of my friends. 
Keeping this review short, there was some major problem in service. We had to wait for half and hour to get a place for hookah. 
Coming to food, we ordered pasta / nachos and blue lagoons. 
Pasta was good so were the nachos. 
Beverages need to be worked upon. 
Overall, I would suggest to upon their service.

First visit to dugout.

Entered with a friend. Got a small table because we were just two of us. Fine!

Ordered hookah - kiwi supari ice base. 

Food and drinks - chilli garlic noodle and coke

Hookah - 

The attendant got the hookah, kept it on our table and started pulling "To charge it" 

While he did this, he was talking to other attendants around and he kept pulling! Like what?

The hookah was good compared to other places, since I always order mild flavours.

The base was leaking I guess because there was spilled water on the table top. When I asked the attendant ‚Äúbhaiya I think this is leaking" and he saw there is spilled water around, his reply was "nahi woh kuch nahi hai" I at least expected him to call somebody to get it cleaned! Can‚Äôt sit around spilled water can we?

Food- 

The chilli garlic noodle wasn‚Äôt that great to discuss here. The noodle wasn‚Äôt exactly thin noodles it was thick spaghetti noodles. 

The ambience - good! Plus one for the choice of songs and video playlist on the projector. 

@ 4.15 we entered. @ 5.30 we asked for change of coal.  @ 6.10 an attendant came to us and asked "do u want anything else? There are people waiting."

And right after this he got us the check. Even though we dint ask for it. It was like ‚Äúok you are done now F**k off!"

Other places they ask ‚Äúare you all done? May I get the check? There are people waiting!‚Äù

Never going back there again.

Had seen it alot of times while passing by and finally decided one day to drop in with a friend for a treat I owed her. The decor was good with soft music in background. But only after having a strawberry smoothie( which was good) my friend demanded to leave that place as according to her the person who attended her was not at all polite and asked her to go and wait outside near the stairs( she had reached earlier and was waiting for me) eventhough the cafe was completely empty with only 2 people occupying other table.

What do you do if all your friends pull hookah and you don't but you people always hang out in hookah places??????
You go to Dugout! So that your friends can enjoy the variety of hookah and you can have the amazing food.
Must tries include the Cheese Garlic bread, Veg club sandwich and Spaghetti.
You can play games and also book a private room for parties! :D

We visited The Dugout on a compulsorily vegetarian week .
This is a restaurant come hookah bar and was quite crowded. They have every kind of tables and couches which I liked .
The service was good. We ordered coke and a lime mojito with babycorn for starters . .the mojito was not good but the babycorn was really good.
We then ordered schezwan noodles and a chilli paneer and both were pretty good.
My only complain is the too loud music and the noise in general and the hookah smoke . .maybe they should make a separate bar or something.
Overall a nice experience and a good place to get vegetarian food!

A cool place to chill out accompanied by loud music and it's interior decoration is based on sports. Brain freezer salsa flavoured hookah is what we ordered. The quality of the hookah is fine and the coal can be changed once without cost. Crispy chilli babycorn was our side dish whose taste was satisfactory. As a whole its absolutely a very cool place to hang out.

If your need of the hour is to relax and call it a day, Dugout is your cup of tea. The place is located on Elgin Road. The ambience is top notch with EDM music pampering your ear buds all the time. The food is very good compared to its peers. Their pizza, soft drinks and macaroni are fantastic. The best part is its value for money. 
Verdict: Will visit in very soon.

This is a nice place to hangout with friends specially in the sports season as you can gorge on or take a shisha as well as have fun watching a live match. One evening we visited this place in a sudden plan to have coffee and ended up having kitkatshake and blue lagoon with chili babycorn. chili babycorn was dry and tasted good with the sauce they used. Kitkat shake and blue lagoon was in their usual form. We decided to come back for hookah sometime.

Dugout is a good place to enjoy seesah with sports. Though the room is not too much, they have really used the space too well. The most comfortable are the bed lounge and the worst are the sofas. They are good at hookah and i do liked their pasta. Had ordered kit kat shake but the shake wasn't up to standards. Overall its better than most of the hookah bars.

This place is in Sarat Bose Road near Nepal sweets and it's quite visible from all corners of the road. It's spread in two floors 1st & 2nd. 

Went there with my family. But this place is not suitable for children's as they serve hookah on both floors. So lot of smoke is there which is not good for children especially on the 2nd floor. 1st floor is still better if you want children to a accompany you. 

Ambience : 

Ambience is nice. It's a small and cozy place on both floors and young and modern look. The crowd is especially youngsters. Big screen is there on 1st floor as I was seated there. So during any live sports event you can watch that also along with hookah and food. Nice music is also playing all the time. 

Food : 

Food is really good and I totally enjoyed it.  We ordered Mexican, Italian and Chinese. All were equally good. They have wide range of variety in food to choose from. Perfect blend of taste. Good job Chef. Portion size was also not bad. It's good enough for 2-3 persons. Prices are also not very high compared to others in this segment. 

Will surely recommend the place to try out for. Only one request that they should make one floor without hookah so that more family people accompanying children's can come often. 

Good place and good team work. Cheers !!!

It has a mind blowing collection of belly wood and hollywood collection..the huge screen in front of u gves u a relaxing nd great view to enjoy.
The staff out there are jus the best.mvery helpful and good to talk to.
They are always up on ur one call and dey even enjoy with the crowd...
We ahd some dslr ppl shooting f full which added on the evening. .
We ordered for BLACK MOHJITO and PURPLE RAIN which are my favourites and dey were jus the way I wanted the taste to be.
Even the WHITE sauce PASTA was very satisfactory and upto the standard but the mexican rice with jacked potatoes where yummy...thw quantity is quite good to serve three people..
We had orderd hukkah PAN flavour it was lite and well falvoured as we wanted and we ordered...
So in total the place is a must visit and waiting fr a next visit...

The service is really good and staffs are friendly. 
If you want to just go,talk and have a good time with your friends,you can sit at the first floor and if you want to chill and enjoy and listen to loud music with dim lights, you can go to the second floor. 
I really like this thing about the place. 
I am a gamer and I always end up going to ps4 corner at the second floor. 
They have that as well for the gamers. :)

Time-7pm,Sunday. Location-Sarat bose road.The interior of the place is very nice and vibrant .It is a two level cafe .the first level has a casual sitting and the second level has a modern seating which include a private soundproof room. The atmosphere is very soothing and the seating are ultra comfortable.
The staff are very friendly and courteous.
One should try kiwi+springwater hookah of this place.In case of food one must definitely try foccacia garlic bread,mexican rice with stuffed jacket potato.
In a nutshell,the place and the hookah are so well done that you can't resist coming back again and again.
Caution: This place get very busy during matches ,choose your time of visit wisely.
Highly recommended.

we followed it up with mexican rice and jacket potato and garlic bread, which were worth having.the service was truly good with the servers being friendly and polite and ever smiling and the karaoke was fantastic.a moment came when the whole of the floor was singing together. Imagine the fun.would surely b coming back here!

A fine place to hangout with friends. Hookah is great , food is great and the service is great and fast. The tables on the second floor are limited so you have to wait in the 1st floor, if it is crowded.
What to order : Mexican rice! Its a must! Veg platter, chilli potato also are a great option
What to avoid : the last two visits i made to dugout i was disappointed with their mix sauce pasta. 
Note : you have to like honey singh songs to enjoy your time here.

The Dugout,one of the popular hookah parlours in Bhawanipore area,went there on 26th Apr,2015 after the IPL match got screwed up thanks to the sudden rainfall.Ir was around 7:30pm and as expected was quite crowded,the second floor was almost full so we settled in the first floor itself,we didnt really try any food so can't comment on that,but the Seesha was good,it was smooth n smoky...and the beverages were refreshing....there is nothing new to say about the interiors since everyone is always aware of the same,service was good.Surely a good place to hangout.

Had heard a lot of hype about this place so decided to visit with a few friends while I was in Kolkata this time. Turned out to be one of the many hookah joints which keep mushrooming in Kolkata by the day. The ambience and decor a little better. Hookah is a little better, nothing great. Food not good at all. Conclusion - Don't go with high hopes it's just another hookah parlor in the heart of the city.

One of the best place in town to have hooka and snacks and watch cricket..
Ambience is superb den comes the quality of food which is really nice except a few like the DABH er sarbot or something I forgot the name, it just was a disaster...
But Chinese bhel crispy fried baby corn and mushroom the pasta then macaroni and the most important is hook these r just like awesome...
Very very good...
In short u want a place and budget is a bit on higher side no place is better than this...

An amazing place when u just want to chill with friends! 
A treat for the sports buffs.
Mexican rice here is a must have! And they have a large variety of lip smacking dishes to accompany shisha ( for the shisha lovers)! 
The ambience, music and courtesy of the staff is something to look out for! 
Im a fan!

One of my favorite places in town to go for hookah and watching the live screening of a match (Football or Cricket). The food and the drinks are really good and have a lot of variety too. For your hookah, please ask 'SUJOY' to make it, he is really good at it. The ambience of the place is the star attraction of this place. It has two floors, the bottom one is a normal hookah parlour, the one above, that's amazing. Totally football themed, with artificial grass on the ground where they allow people to sit during rush hours. It has PS3 or PS4 (I don't remember exactly) for people who wanna enjoy video games with their hookah (It's not free guys !! :P). One place where most of the hookah parlours face problem, Staff, Dugout has really well behaved staff in a good quantity. They usually don't delay any orders.

The reason why this place gets a 4.0 is that its a little expensive for regular hookah smokers. For 2-3 days a week, this place is highly recommended.

If you're an avid football fan you must visit this place. Situated in one of the happening places of Kolkata, the place has a different feel to it. Amazing football decor. Ambience is quite good. Shisha is good but still needs to improve. If you're lucky enough you can get to play FIFA in Ps4 whilst having hookah. Quite spacious. A bit overpriced. 
Service is outstanding. The ultimate sports pub for hangouts. I didn't have any food here so can't comment on that. 

Personally I really loved this place and want to visit again in the near future. Do drop in guys. :-)

It is divided into two halves. One part is good for those Who don't enjoy loud music and another one is best for music-lovers. 

Hookah is good. i agree sometimes in rush hours, the servicing isn't that good but is otherwise amazing. One food that every table orders is Dugout's Mexican Rice with which can be complemented crispy chilly potatoes/baby-corn/Mushroom.

PS4 lovers can even enjoy the place. it is serviced freely which is more exciting.

One of the best hookah cafes in the city I have ever come across. 
The shisha is pretty awesome with amazing music which ranges from edm to progressive. 
The food and shakes are nice too, but the oreo shake is a must here. 
The staff are attentive and sometimes they may try and get a bit over friendly which might get irritating. The PS4 is additional plus point for Fifa lovers. 
Overall it's better than most other cafes in the vicinity. 
Shisha - 4/5

Located in one of the most happening places of Kolkata. If you are a football fan, and a real one, there should be no second thought on visting the place. I went there alone, and ended up with 3 new friends. Drinks not allowed. The feel and ambience is the thing to look out for. A little costly but good to go once in a while.

Dugout surprised me. I thought it to b just another budget place with a snazzy name but thankfully the place changed my mind. The place is very aptly named. The football decor was really good. Food is ok n very generous. Its easy to locate very close to Azad hind n service is on its tow all the time to help. Sheesha is also very good. 
Only grievance ab this place is that it only serves veg n there is also no bar which is a big let down. They should definitely look to it.

As it was a Sunday, me with my family decided to visit dugout as its exploring in regards to reviews and recommendations.¬†
So we reached there at around 10.00 pm.
The parking was easily available just outside the premise.
The name board outside is nicely designed with visibility personified. - THE DUGOUT
The guard outside was too kind and dedicated towards his work.
Wishing all five of us good evening as we entered.

The place is divided into two floors.
The lower one is sober and decent with white walls and not so comfortable sofas.

Some of our friends had already told us to grab a seat on the upper floor.
So we asked them if we could get a table upstairs but due to ongoing match it was full house.
We went up to just check out the upper level it was indeed jam-packed.
So we came down and took a table there.
As we started ordering one gentlemen came up to us and politely asked us to wait for 5 mins as he can shift us to the VIP area upstairs.
We were happy and waited for around 3 mins as he came back to assist us to the VIP area.
The VIP area is the X-factor of this place.
With a seating capacity of 15 pax and personalized music system and television it really gives you a VIP feel.
The ambiance is good - ceilings nicely themed with galaxy design sheets.
walls with nice granite and black tinted glass.
The windows had rope curtains which overall was giving it a very sporty yet elegant look.
Appreciable efforts in interiors.

Then after reading the vast menu which contains Mexican, Italian, Continental and many more cuisines.
We ordered for

Supari gum shisha with ice base - The hubble - Bubble was trust me - very smoky and the both the flavours were in right proportion.
P.S - It did not choke.

Mexican Rice with jacked pototoe - Rice was Brilliant and tasted fantastic but the jacked potatoe can be worked upon.
The courteous moment - In the rice we found a small hard plastic which could have been hazardous if swallowed.
We showed it to the SAZIT - the service guy¬†
He took that piece of plastic and rushed to his management.
Manager came up to us and apologized.
The best part of the incident was that no one panicked.
They dealt with the issue in a very matured and calm manner.
Sazit came up to us and said that we have informed the kitchen staff and we will make sure it does not happen again. Its definitely a mistake made by us and we are sorry for this.
But DUGOUT - MAKE SURE THIS KIND OF INCIDENT STRICTLY DOESN'T HAPPEN. IT SHOWS YOUR KITCHEN IS NOT HYGIENICALLY MAINTAINED.

Veg Delight Thin crust pizza - PERFECT! I loved it.

Exotic Risotto - Risotto was decent could have been better if the taste was not so bland and had more amount of exotic vegetables in it. I had to add Tabasco to gulp in.

Italian Sizzler with pasta base - Presentation "wow" Taste "average"
The sizzler platter contained Pasta base with mcain aloo tikki, stir fried exotic vegetables and 2 slice of chilly cheese non baked bread.
All the over the tops tasted good but the pasta base was not up to the mark.
The taste of the sauces vanished due to herbs being over put.
We asked the management if anything could be done of this pasta and we were so full by that time¬†
So they told us that they will rectify the pasta and pack it for us to takeaway.
Really a smart move - Appreciated.

Black Mojito - Thumbs up! Recommended for people who love mojitos.

Hammain Fizz - Good one! Not even a bit was left in the glass.

Daab Sikanjee (its there secret) - I was really excited when i ordered this drink. As i seriously wanted to know whats the secret behind this daab sikanjee.
Alas! It was not satisfactory!¬†
It was daab pani with pudina powder.
Could have been more innovative.

All in all a very nice place to hang out with your friends and family.
Vast and elaborated menu.
Interiors and ambiance really worked hard upon.
Shisha - Awesome!¬†
Gourmet and mock-tails can be improved to make it PERFECT!
Surely gonna Visit it sooner.
Recommended.
Cheers!¬†

P.S - A very nice place to click SELFIES.

The selection of song in dugout is always better as compared to other cafes.
I will recommend hukkah lovers to visit this cafe. And i promise that you will fall in love ..

In no time The Dugout has become the official den for all sports freaks who just love to support their favorite teams be it soccer or cricket...The amazingly put together football themed outlet gives u the ambiance to enjoy the games and spend some quality time with friends. I had gone there with my friends for Manchester United match and the atmosphere was electric...ryt from the cheers to the boooosss...it had all.

Coming to the food...we ordered Crispy Chili Babycorn and Schezwan Chow...what it lost in quantity gained in taste and quality and we had no complaints whatsoever.
Cheese Sandwich was good...I really liked the Cold Coffee with Ice Cream...it was not over loaded with ice cream so as to give the right flavors of coffee.
The hookah was also superb...the Ice Base only made it better...the smoke was dense and the Brain Freezer was a complete knockout.

The Staff is really friendly and helpful. They helped us out to get us the seats we desired. Great customer service. Though this place maybe a little high on your budget but its definitely worth a visit. Hugely impressed.

Dugout is a very prominently located joint on the main road. Has two floors as far as I understood. Very nicely designed with the theme as said in the name of the place. Looks very much like a sports cafe but dominated by football due to the design of the interiors. Quite impressive!!
Ordered for the Chinese bhel, manchow soup and a sizzler with hookah to start with.. The dos hookah was recommended and so was ordered... Loved the taste of the hookah and the icy cold smoke. Huge quantity of Chinese bhel was a treat to my taste buds.. My wife was also very satisfied with the sizzler and manchow soup.
A real delightful experience at dugout... Keep up the good work guys...

For the second time today I have been impressed by this place. The most common favour I.e. double apple with mint is generally not made correctly in most of the hookah places but this place right about made it perfectly. The Mexican rice was great all though instead of spicy it was a little tangy on the gravy. The daab shikangi was truly chefs special. Didn't feel like it was made with artificial flavour but freshly made. Hats off...

There's nothing to complain about the ambience. Starting from the posters on the walls, to the couches, everything is modelled to give you that dressing-room feel. Plus the music and the TV and the games and the good hookah.  The food is exquisite, although vegetarian. The service is decent enough. With two floors, its too much to take in, in one day. So a return to The Dugout is a must.

Easy to locate. Amazing ambience and I love the music that's played. Strictly veg and trust me you won't regret it. The best part about this place is it has a non smoking zone. As for me, I don't smoke hookah neither do my friends. We sat in the smoking free zone and ordered chilli potato, nachos, haka noodles and pasta.
All of the preparations were lip smacking! 

As for the hookah , been there with another group of friends who are hookah lovers. Definitely worth a try.

Happy eating! :)

Nice n cool place to hang out wid frnz n family. Ambience is awesome. A sporty ambience n a perfect place for ppl whu luv sports. Sheesha is nice. Food is gud. Mexican Rice wid jacket potatoes is d dish wich is a must here. One cn jus not resist his/her tastebuds from having it. Mocktails r also a gud options to try. Kit kat shake is gud. Apart from all dese one cn also arrange a get together here as dey also provide seperate chambers. 

I wud certainly b visiting it all days during d 2015 WORLD CUPS.

2nd visit :-
I visited this place for the second time on 7/02/2014 after an awesome time in the 1st visit.
But this visit dissappointed me very much in terms of service and hospitality.
We were six of us. When we went there ,thier 2nd floor was full and we were promised a table in the 2nd floor after 15 minutes but till the end i.e after 90 minutes also, we didn't get a table there and we had to end our meal in their 1st floor section whose ambience was not upto the mark
. Staff were unable to maintain the crowd and we had to call them at least thrice but the chefs made up their negligence by food..
We ordered a "crispy chilli babycorn", the best i had..the babycorn was so crispy that my friend spilled two while picking it in his fork and at last exhausted, he used the serving spoon to have them!
Next we ordered a nachos; with cheese on top was served with two dips,one salsa and one cheese dip.. The nachos were awesome...
The potato wedges were nice but lacked the crisp...
Red sauce pasta was simply lipsmaking..we even used our fingers to have the last drop of sauce..üòÅ
Hakka noodles were tossed with the correct amount of veggies and sauces.. A delight to have ..
They didn't had pizza and garlic breads that day but that didn't made a problem..
We asked the man on the counter a fifty times to transfer us to the 2nd floor but every time they were ignorant..
Frankly speaking we were there only because of their 2nd floor and food.. and their promise made us stay there but at last we were happy only coz. of food..
A good work by chefs..
But deleting a ‚òÜ because of their negligence and service and "lie."

1st visit :
It has got a glorified spot in cafes of kolkata...
"Dugout", I personally love to go there...I have been there only once but that was a very nice experience...
Its interior is its best part..it creates such a nice ambience that doubles the feel..
Talking about the food...it is delicious...pasta,pizza and all are awesome...
Do try out pizza..its yumm...
Will sure visit again. ...

Had to wait more than half an hour,there was a rush of people out there ,the upper level was nice but more could have been with the interiors,food was  not so nice,we ordered an aribiata mix sauce pasta which was just ok and a kitkat shake which was just average,the sheesha we ordered was a light one but was served one with loads of mint,would prefer cafe green apple or 360 degree any day for the sheesha,overall food was ok but a lot could be done to improve it more.

There are many shisha lounges in Kolkata but what makes Dugout different from others is 'entertainment'. They dont just sell you a smoke blasting machine (hookah)  or a finger licking variety of cuisines, they in reality sell you entertainment... And the rest follows! A beautifully conceptualised interiors with sports related merchandise oozing out of the walls. Its a sportslovers paradise. And to top it all up or as we say, the cherry on the cake, Its freakishly low budgeted. It is in reality MY dugout :p!!

What the hell is this?? Sports bar !!! ¬†I have not seen a stupid ¬†in my life who opens a "Sports bar" with Chai, snakes and pizza-pasta and no Beer!!! ROFL.
Can you image " hukka with football"??!! football fans will commit suicide if eye these combos.
¬†Pure waste of money and energy.Please go to Irish house and quest which could give you some sort ambience of "sports bar"( PS: I am not vouching any bar personally).
Owers please ¬†grow up and ¬†misleading football lovers who want to have some feelings of english pubs during weekend battles in town.

Although food was decent and appearence as sports bar but no at all acceptable as sportsbar.and"veg eating crowd" along with "love birds chit-chats"make it most horrible.

Yaak!!

I felt very dissapointed .

A nice place for a hookah evening with frnz. The first floor decor isn't much to talk about however the hookah was extremely amazing! we ordered a kiwi hookah which had wonderful flavour. The food was up to the mark quality wise as well as quantity. The kit kat shake and virgin mojito were great! special mention for mexican rice and cheese macaroni! lip smacking :D

Located on the main road in sarat bose road,opp of little donkey & 5 min walk from forum.The place is huge as divided in 2 floors with ample seating capacity but the ambience is not so attractive !! 
I sat on the 2nd floor with my friends..where the music was so loud that we felt on the verge of being deaf.On repeated requests to staffs to low down the volume,each one of them seemed to be least bothered.
Food odered was good with ample quantity but the Service was super delayed.We ordered starters & main course...which was brought al togethr.It was as if they jst want to dump all the food.
Personaly didnt liked the place much !!!

Awsum place.... Not just for hookah lovers but even for small parties.. Just celebrated my son's 3rd birthday party with his frenzz..:-) the VIP zone is separate from the hookah zone thus making it kid friendly.. Even the music and AC can be controlled for that zone.. Food is very good with good variety.. Service is xllent and the staff is very courteous and always eager to do something for you.. The management by Mr Vinay is also very good. This place is highly recomended for small get-togethers and parties even with kids...:-)

I had been there yesterday with some friends..i was really looking forward to try hookah for the first time and wanted a good experience. The location was not so hard to find out. When we entered we found out that the ambience was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was good. Hookah remained for a good time and flavours lasted long. Oh i forgot to mention that we were also entertained by a comedy show. Overall a very good first time hookah experience. :-) Thankyou!

It's A Pure Veg Cafe. Very nice. 

Must try their Mexican Rice !! 

Cheers !!

It quite funny how I came across DugOut. So the other day, it was raining quite heavily and we were stuck in a jam and I couldnt control my pee ! Dugout the saviour ! :D So I ran into dugout.. for a moment I'd forgotten that I need to use the loo coz I personally love sheeshas and I came across a great sheesha place in Kolkata (atleast look wise initially).

We cancelled our plans and decided to chill in Dugout !
Sheesha- AMAZING !
Ambience and theme- AMAZING !
Music- SUPERB !
Food & Service- Decent. :)

A titsy bitsy improvement and we're good to go. :)

Located in main road of sarat bose road this place is huge and has been devided into 2 floors...the ambience of the first floor is not that great but the second floors football themed layout steals the show...coming to the service it was very slow and seemed like the staff could'nt cope up with so many people together and they were getting confused...hookah was pathetic it had to be changed a couple of times and still there was no smoke and it was choking as well...food was bad as well we had ordered for pasta,potato rosti,and nachos,wanted to have jalepeno poppers which was not available that day...
You can try this place once if you are lucky you may get good service and food...
P.S sit on the 2nd floor

Ambience: One of its kind in Calcutta. Just wins your heart! Against what the name suggests, you don't have to be one of those crazy football fans to enjoy this decently-funky themed caf√©. 

Food: Decent food. Not the best in town, yet mouth watering! Pizzas and garlic breads are a must have. Crispy chilly baby corns are over spiced though.

Hookah: Smooth shishas served. Depends on the flavors you order, though. 

Service: No compromise. No regrets. Soft spoken people! Always ready to help and serve.

Overall experience: Feels lively! Feels good! 
Cheers.

Location: Sarat Bose Road.

This happening place is located a few minutes away from Jai Hind. You'll be able to locate it on your left while traveling towards Minto park from Jai Hind after the first signal after Jai Hind. Exactly opposite The Little Donkey and diagonally opposite to Spalicious.

About the ambiance, this place has a mesmerizing touch to it thanks to the amazing and comfortably-volumed collection of music that plays here and the interiors have been thoughtfully done keeping the essence of it's name intact as well as the mindset of a caf√©.
It's a two-level Caf√© which can accommodate an approximate of ninety heads at one go.
The first floor having a classic style interior of a caf√© whereas the second level having the modernized look of oval seating and the essence of the name grained in it. Also, has a private soundproof section for parties which can accommodate an approximate of fifteen heads, enjoy without a disturbance from the outside.

Talking about the fooding, having visited a number of times and having tried a number of dishes that are served here, a recommendation list is an easy task now. So here we go:

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn
- Nachos
- Garlic Bread (Usual as well as Foccacia)
- Mexican Rice with Jacket Potatoes
- Bruschettas
- Crunchy Vegetables
- Veg. Delight (Thin crust Pizza)
- Sizzler (Chinese/Malaysian)
- Fried Rice (Burnt Ginger/Schezwan)
- Noodles (Chilli Garlic/Hakka)

[List updated on: October 16, 2014]

- Portions are quite generous, please order with a handy tip from the server. Would help minimize wastage. :)
- Sheeshas were found to be smoky, smooth and long lasting on all my visits.

The service out here has always been prompt. The staff has a fair knowledge about the menu and are affable enough to help you with your orders; on their toes for sure. Impressive.

A moderately priced place.

Has always been a great experience. :)
-Hope to see this place maintain it's quality of food and service, a long way to go. :)

Now this is a hookah parlour which really interested me. Whenever i passed this place, i saw the football icon and wanted to visit it. Atlast did it. Yayie!
The ambience-nice. Unlike most other places which has almost dim lights. This place had the natural feel.
The staff-friendly. Jolly. Always eager to talk. And this actually didnt even feel 'clingy'. Kudos!
The sheesha-ordered a strong one as suggested by the staff. Had to change the first coal too soon. The second one went on for long. Loved the white stand of the hookah.
The food-We ordered:
Veg Delight Pizza-the crust was so thin, awesome! The cheese was in good proportion too. The whole plate is big enough for 2-3 heads.
Chilli Potato-it was HOT! I gulped down three bottles of water for it. Uhh ohh!
Tagiatalli Pasta(mixed sauce)-always my favorite. It was cheesy. The sauce was tasty. I will surely try this again.
Pocket pinch:approximately 1500. Just like how it is at other places.
I am extremely satisfied after my first visit. I hope it will remain the same in my following visits. Recommended. Cheerie!

Sooo this place proves it perfectly that if you are visting to a Hookah Bar you wont get great food...Being a non hookah group,we ordered Chinese Bhel,Penne in mixed sauce,Chilli garlic noodles,American corn pepper salt..and the only thing that dint have oil droopin out of the bowl was Chinese bhel for obvius reasons...American corn pepper salt was a unique dish as the Waiter out there claimed it to be,it was more of a corn chat than the authentic American corn pepper salt..
In short,Bad food...Bad service..wouldnt visit this again even its for free...

The Dugout!.. The place to be ..!!.. after a long time Kolkata has got a much needed very superbly done *themed* lounge .. all the details for the theme has been kept in check..from the grass carpet to the football themed decor.. 
The food and shisha were amazing too and worth going  8 miles to enjoy it.. ( as was my case) .. we ordered special shisha which was lil expensive but it was smooth and lasted long too.. Italian sizzler was nice with a lil bland texture as it should be with Italian cuisine.. mocktail Litche High Base was what we took after much details about the other options..and it was unique and awesome.. not too sweet .. and even cafe mocha .. overall the experience was superb and the USP of thus place is the staff ..! highly friendly and courteous.. A must visit from my side ..giving 4.5 so that there is aspiration to get higher everytime!

The best part about this place is its ambience. The entrance is contemporary glittery n sexy. The theme inside is cool. Hookah was average. Didn't taste the food so this rating is only for hookah n ambience. And one last thing which I would like to add is that the staff is friendly but their service is slow.

The Dugout, located very near to the Samilton Hotel..Had a visit 2 days back with my friend at the 1st floor section...I did not like the entrance as dere was nobody to open d gate.  The interiors are quite good with good lights..I got really impress as i saw the wall postures of some famous sportsperson like Sachin Tendulkar, Rafael Nadal..etc..

Hookah and Food ordered:-
Teen paan Ice base- The hookah was decent enuff to hav  but due to chilling A.C could not blow rings..Did'nt even choke once..Lasted quite long..
2 Red Bull
Nachos- Really like the nachos here as they serve it with the special orange and bean dip..

Pros:-
1) Prime location
2) Food Quality
3) Nice decor.
4) Quite spacious..

Cons:-
1) A bit expensive comapring to other parlors..
2) Staffs should be more attentive..!!

Will come to this place very soon and try out different things at d 2nd floor section...Recommended from my side..Must try..!!

Well . Dugout . When I saw this place for the first time from outside I thought that this place must be amazing like it looks. So no doubt I wanted to try this place . The first problem about this place is parking issue . You need to park about 3-4 walking distance from this place . The second thing the sitting arrangement for 2 persons next to the glass part is so small . You won't be able to move your legs or sit comfortably there . I ordered 3 pan hookah and when I got it believe me it was only mint nothing else . I complained and they took the hookah and when they got it again it was same . There was no point arguing with them as they taught me that this is only 3 paan and I am taking hookah regularly since last 6 years . That means I am new . Cool man . I also ordered bruschetta and one Malaysian sizzler . After 15 min on being asked regarding my food  the person comes and tells me that bruschettas is not available . Then I said get me Mexican wrap instead of it . Again after 10 min the person comes and tell me it's not available . I got pissed and asked then to cancel all my food order . Then suddenly after 2 min a person comes and he say me I can ARRANGE Mexican wrap for you but It would take time . As I was super hungry I asked him to get it . Took about half n hour I got my Mexican wrap and it was shit . They used some maida roti and  filled with whatever they can which at one bite you would feel like throwing away . I don't know whether they knew what's Malaysian sizzler because it was totally different to what it was written in the menu. On being asked about why is this shit going for everything they said ACHA AADMI NAI MILRAHA HAI . Dude why did open the cafe then . I also ordered Choclate shake and I thought it was also the first time I am having a Choclate shake . Anyways a request to dugout keep good chef , a person who knows to make good hookah and to place right bill to the customer because they have me someone else bill .

I visited this place a few days after it had opened, i had to wait for quite a lot of time and when we were finally given a table, we were told that we would have to vacate in 40 minutes. The staff is arrogant ,rude ,ignorant and inexperienced. How can u force a paying customer to leave in a given time even before he is seated. Anyway moving on we were suggested to try the chefs special buger but it turned out to be the most disgusting burger i have ever had. We ordered a few oyher things ,all below the mark. Our experience was so bad that we left in less than 30 mins,never to return back!

Have become a big regular at this place.
The first thing which strikes you is the amazing ambience and theme , kolkata needed a place like this.
The location is among the best possible in the city being situated in sarat bose road which is quickly becoming the night hub of kolkata.
Coming to the shisha in my innumerable experiences i have hardly had any issues. Hookah comes on time evrytime and comes with a gurantee of satisfing you evry time.
The food had a few issues towards the beginning bt with time they have set a high benchmark with the food quality. What makes it stands out is that it provides quite a few filling yet easy on wallet options unlike many cafes like mexican rice with jacket potatoes , cheese rosti rice and range of noodles. The staff are also extremely friendly.

I had been there for quite a few football matches and the place realy comes alive , the whole atmosphere is electrifing.
A must visit for all sports fans.

The Dugout is the quite new entrant at sarat bose road, which is quite slowly becoming the foodies lane in kolkata. Like Lavelle road in bangalore or khan market in New Delhi.  As soon as you enter, a giant football structure at the wall welcomes you. Spread in two floors,  the mezzanine floor is quite happening.  People running this restaurant, surely knows the music sense of the patrons.  Hats off for it. Hookah will come on time unlike many other cafes and it would be dense in smoke.  They don't have all the items mentioned in the menu available, but that can be considered as the initial teething problem that a new restaurant faces. Prices are pocket friendly. server will pay attention to your smallest gestures.  Friendly ambience.  A must visit. Late nights are more happening.

The Dugout - The name says it all!
=========================
Location:¬†
It is located very near to the Samilton hotel. Go a little front of it while travelling from jai hind and there you discover "The Dugout"
=========================
Brief:

For those of who don't know what Dugout means, with respect to cricket and football, dugout is a team's bench area and is located on the ground's boundary, outside of the general field of play. I had been to Dugout twice with my friends and i tried both the 1st floor section and the 2nd floor section (Grass section for groups). When i visited the below section the first time, i was quite impressed with the interiors. In these days, i am happy that people are coming up with less shady hookah parlours and good lightings. They had very nicely decorated the below interiors keeping their theme as sports and putting a lot of wall postures of famous people like Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and more. I really liked the table for two section wherein two people coming for a serious conversation can enjoy their privacy too. Nevertheless, as i went upstairs.. upstairs they had sofas and all and it was mostly to cater to the groups. They even had a PS4 for those of who wanted to play Fifa. The section does not end here. In the inside, they had a separate party room where groups can easily chill around. Quite impressive.¬†
=========================
Beverages, hookah and food ordered:

===First experience at the upper section===

1) Brownie Ice Cream Shake - It was too good. However, i would recommend to keep a large piece of brownie on the top and make the other pieces very small because it makes it difficult to sip it from the straw. Serving with a spoon would be great.¬†

2) Chilly Noodles - They were too good. Not too oily. and not too dry. Perfect.¬†

3) Brain Freezer Hookah - It was made perfectly. Even though the A.c. was chilling which we want, the hookah lasted quite long.¬†

===Second experience at the lower section===

1) Kesar Chai - It was served to me in white ceramic cup. How often do we see chai served in such way?¬†

2) Nachos - It was served to me with mayo, their special orange dip and bean dip. It was great. It was full with cheese on top of it.¬†

3) Kachikerry Orange Hookah - I had never tried this before. But it was worth the money. :) #must try

===Third experience at the upper section (Private Section for Birthdays) ===
As one of my friend had a birthday here, we decided to dine in here at this section. The only issue at this section was that the tables are too small to accommodate a large number of items. Quality of food is excellent!!

1) Virgin Mojito - It was decent enough. However, it can be improved more.
2) Daab Sherbet - It had a lot of pudina flavor which overlapped the daab flavor. Suggestions have been considered by the management.
3) Bruschetta - It was amazing. #must try here.¬†
4) Cheesy Garlic Bread - It was good too. The parsley flavor was complimenting really well.
5) Baby Corn - Crispy enough to satiate your palate. #must try.
6) Mexican Rice with Jacked Potatoes - It was one of the best out here in dugout. #must try.
7) Cheese Spreaded on top of rice - The rice tasted bit bland. However, with cheese, it was good. A little more salt on rice was needed.
8) White sauce pasta - It was good enough. Pasta lovers - must try.¬†
9) Potato wedges - The potato wedges were served with their special orange dip. The wedges were crunchy and tasted good. However, over the top black salt was added on it which took up it's flavour. I would suggest just to add white salt a bit and serve. That would keep it simple and enjoyable.¬†
10) Kiwi Spring water sheesha - As usual good.¬†
=========================
Pros:¬†

1) Prime location.
2) Reasonably priced.¬†
3) Courteous staffs.
4) Excellent decor.
5) Amazing food.¬†
6) Amazing entrance.
7) Service was prompt.¬†
8) Quite spacious. Does not feel suffocated.
9) Pure Veg Cafe.
10) A.c. is a win win. Too chilling.¬†
11) Recently got stereotype slogans which can be used with Selfie's. Good concept to start off with.¬†

Cons:¬†

1) Over priced a bit with respect to the sheesha. Could have been 300-320 at the most.¬†
2) The billing is done in the 2nd floor in front of the tables. However, as i said it was quite noted with the owner and he said it was temporary.¬†
=========================
Suggestions:

1) Maintain the consistency.
2) Make sure you come out with more offers.¬†
3) Get new dishes in the menu.¬†
=========================
Summary:

Food quality 4.3/5
Food quantity 4/5
Food presentation 4/5
Taste 4/5
Value for money 3.7/5
Hygiene 4.5/5
Ambience 4.5/5
Hookah 4/5 ( Did not choke even once)
=========================
Conclusion:¬†

I would love to visit their cafe again in near future. It was a good experience here. Recommended and a must try. :)¬†
=========================
Note: This is an unbiased review based on 'my dining' experience'¬†

Pictures will be updated shortly. :)

Located at a great location and having a nicely done up interiors, this place requires a lot of tune up. They are not equipped to serve the guests cz the service is too slow by cafe standards. 
We ordered pizza which was not available, we ordered ordered garlic bread which was gain not available. I We DID NOT order any smoothie which was served on our table, we ordered one sizzler and we got two of them and we were told we ordered two. Howe er, they agreed to take back one. 
Food was good, hookah not upto the mark. 
Basics needs to be corrected.

Visited The Joint Few Weeks Back. The Place Has Great Ambience With The Football Theme. Coming To Hookah Which Was Not At All Upto The Mark. Hookah Was Changed 2Times. The Food Is Having A Lot Of Issues. When Coming To Service The Place Try's To Cater More Guests Than The Capacity. We Were Asked To Leave The Table In 45mins By The Manager & Waiters So That They Could Accommodate Other Guests. This Kind Of Service Was Not Expected. I Would Never Recommend This Place Nor Will Ever Visit Again.

Probably much awaited sports cafe of Kolkata!! Visited the place twice.. I was excited but service and food quality is a concern.. Remain over crowded all the time.. Biggest problem after half n hour manager n waiters will force you to leave the cafe as they are more concern about thr personal guests!! To avoid such kind of insult no more dugout for me..

The city badly needed such a hangout which is vibrant (at the 2nd floor) as well as soothing (at the 1st floor). A brilliant contrast!! The rich interior definitely gives it a stadium-like atmosphere...and the great food will compel you to take more bites than Suarez.. :p

A very satisfying shelter 'dug'.This is some what kolkata needs,fabulous ambiance.whenever you get a chance to go there for hangout try "the dugout special" worth it.I must say they have got hardworking staff-members.

A new den for hookah lovers opened doors at the start of the FIFA WC 2014. Sport afficianados would be impressed by the ambience. Ohh wait, they got a pretty smart entrance. Even if you're new to the city, this place is easily visible from the road - a prime location. A big plus. To be really honest, I'm pretty impressed by the pricing. The hookah was good. But, the service is on a slower side, sadly. The staffs were generous & smiling, which nearly covered their slow service flaw. No food review coz i didn't tasted one - there's always a next time. Recommended. :)

This place was a major letdown. The ambience was good and they made a mean hookah. Unfortunately, the treatment by the staff was deplorable.

I entered with two of my friends to watch the game. They had an area with a PS4. We inquired about the charges and were told there were none for the time being so we sat down there. We ordered the Hookah and began playing. After half an hour, the guy comes along and says that our "Hookah time" is over and no coal changes would be allowed. None of us had ever heard of this concept before. So we asked him to come back after 10 mins so we could decide what to get next.

Much to our surprise, the guy arrived with our bill without so much as asking us if we were done. It was quite clear that he was driving us out to accommodate more people. The person also implied that he did us a favour by letting us play on the PS for free even though he specifically told us that there is no charge for it. 

This place has great potential but I don't understand the philosophy of pushing away their own customers.

Went there for the 1st time yesterday but was highly let down ! 
1) they have very shady looking glass tables which aren't even stable ! They don't have accommodation for 3-4 ppl ! 

2) the place was very dirty and tables and windows were never cleaned !

3) most of the food items are ready made and just needs to be fried ! We ordered for nachos but it took over 25 mins to come! It was like normal packet stuff and they grated cheese over it and served it ! Next was the potato roesti which took 40 mins to come and it was just the same packet stuff just fried with grated cheese on top ! Our pizza never came for 1 hour so we cancelled it ! 
4) no one even came to take our order for the 1st 15 mins ! They can't be bothered. 
5) music was crappiest for a sports bar ! It was blasting with tomorrowland music and we couldn't even have a conversation ! 
6) bill was the fastest thing that came but they charged us for 3 hookahs when we ordered only one ! Plus they have this rubbish service charge on the bill with the worst service !  
Id never wanna go back to a place like that  !

It is located at Sarat Bose Road and Chakerberia crossing. Parking is an issue, they were not having valet parking. It being main road you need to search parking in near by lanes.
As we see from outside "The Dugout" it seems to create a hype and high expectation of theme hangout. It would not reach to the expectation. 1st floor is very dull. 2nd floor did bring some excitement there is huge screen to watch matches. Grass like carpet gives nice feel but the seats are small and uncomfortable to sit through few hours. More of dugout look and feel could be added. 
There is very small section for live gaming for 2 people. Nice music was being played.
 Spacious inside.
Hookah was amazingly perfect. Food was fine, not exceptional.
Just work on the seating arrangement and get more of dugout feel.
