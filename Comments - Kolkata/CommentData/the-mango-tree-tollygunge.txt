Went there on 24 th evening.  I dont know why people are giving it such poor ratings. I loved this place. . It is BEAUTIFULLY decorated. Nice music. 
We ordered Butter garlic squid which melted in our mouth  with an awesome sweet tangy taste .
Then we had seafood green rice with crab masala.
The crab masala was fingerlicking ly delicious. Will come back to try more dishes.

The only negative point is the unprofessionalism of the stuff and that they make you wait long for food.
Quite pocket friendly

The chinese here was essentially delicious and light on the stomach. The noodles was brilliant, the crispy chilli babycorn couldn't have been better and the prawns had a certain tenderness and a beautiful crunch to it. The ambience was great as well, the feel was a lot similar to a British Bungalow. And the staff was warm.

If you would like to have hookah with a lot of spicy food inside a closed room, you got the place right here.
However if you are expecting an exotic or a touch of authenticity towards the chinese cuisine, this isn't the place. It's hard to get instructions through to the service. Pretty limited menu when it comes to anything non-spicy. The setting is pretty nice. But that you would find everywhere nowadays.

Bought coupons for my birthday treat from nearbuy for my bday treat. The Chinese here is amazing. The place is cosy and the ambience is beautiful. The staff is friendly. It is located just opposite the end of cemetery very close to the CCD. I can't emphasis more about how amazing the food was.

The place has such a cute decor! But lacks music, it was so quiet..

Nothing out of the ordinary in the menu.. But the food quality could have been better.. I like my fried rice (especially if it costs almost Rs 200) to have proper rice, not fat stubby round rice. And the devils sauce chicken was clumpy, like something with too much corn flour.
The crispy chilli baby corn, schezwan noodles and chilli paneer better, yet again, nothing extraordinary.

This one is located much near to my home. Went there recently with my husband. Its two storied and quite spacious. Coming to the food we ordered smoked fish and crispy konjee chicken. The fish was fresh and the spices were perfectly balanced. The chicken was not as crispy but tasted prettygood nevertheless. Overall a nice experience.

Fingerlickin' Good. Mango Tree Was Not Our First Choice For That Day's Haul But I'm So Happy That We Had To Go For The Second Option Which Was "The Mango Tree". We Had Very Strange Variations Of Food That Day. But My Personal Favourite Were The Squid Preparation And Ofcourse The LASAGNA. I Had Lasagna For The Very First Day And Goddd That Was Sooo Good. So We Were Hungry AF, We ordered So Many Items So We Assumed That The Bill Will Be Expensive But Surprisingly That Was Way Cheeper Than We Thought It Would Be. So I Will Suggest All Of You. Go There. Have Lasagna. Stay Happy. Adios Amigos.

This place is quite difficult to locate. Interiors are good as well as the ambience. Now coming to the food which I didn't find anything extraordinary but yes of course price was reasonable. For starters we took various chicken and lamb dishes whose name I could not remember. The starters were quite good. But yes the chicken ham bacon wrap was amazing and was the best among all which actually had cheese in it and it was quite heavy and yum. One should definitely not miss this particular dish.Then we went for squid masala, sea food red rice, chicken fried rice,Kung Pao chicken and chicken in black bean sauce. Well except for squid masala nothing really didn't amaze me. The chicken fried rice also didn't even have enough chicken.
Overall this place is ok for one time visit, but yes if I am visiting again I am going to surely have chicken cheese ham wrap again.

Locating this place was a bit difficult, however their map on the menu card as highlighted in zomato proved to be helpful (lies beside the extreme end of the Tollygunge Cemetery on the Golf Green road connector side) . Went there for lunch today. Really loved the interior decor though the place is a bit crampy (seating capacity is limited to 6 tables). Two books even caught my eye...Jewish Legends and Scandinavian Myth. The staff was very courteous and helped us out with what to order during our usual midway decision crisis. We had ordered the House special squid fry(dry) for starters and Seafood Fried Rice and Devil's Pork for mains. The Squid Fry was quite crunchy, well cooked and perfectly seasoned. The fried garlic and sauces really uplifted the flavour of the dish. A must try. The seafood rice was also good though yes it lacked a bit of seafood. Only a few octopus tentacles and squid were found in the rice. The Devil's Pork was well cooked, well seasoned and i really loved the colour of the gravy. Though yes the pork that the restaurant uses is mainly meat and less or no amount of pork fat at all. Now any signature Pork dish is defined by pork fat so yes the Devil's Pork they served lacked that signature dish feel today. Therefore maybe the restaurant can take this as a suggestion and use more pork fat in their pork dishes. Almost forgot to mention this but the service time was excellent and on point. Do try out this place.

Very disappointing! We ordered roasted chicken for starter and it was completely spoilt...on complaining they served another 'fresh' plate of chicken which was spoilt too..Finally we cancelled all the chicken dishes that we ordered and opted for  noodles and chilli babycorn which luckily was fine..Also it took them forever to serve the food..overall horrible experience.. never going back there..

Ordered take away from this place. Chili Chicken (dry) and Drums of Heaven.

The chili chicken was less chicken and more onion + capsicums. I think there were 8 pieces but they grew progressively smaller in size. The Drums of Heaven were too spicy and should've been called Chili Drums of Heaven.

Definitely not worth the money. Terribly overpriced items.

We opted for home delivery from this outlet and it was a tragic ordeal. Maybe the dine-in experience would have been different but based on the disappointment we went through, I wouldn't bet a penny on that. 

We ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Squid Masala. The anaemic chicken pieces were thickly coated and the slimy gravy tasted way sweeter for my palate. The squid dish was essentially a mush and the texture of the seafood was lost amidst the mess. 

The quantities were adequate. The only positive that I can dig up from this ruin was the delivery time. They delivered before the expected time. Such a letdown it was that my zeal to continue this has been squandered.

Disappointment. Utter disappointment. That's the only thing that's coming to my mind while writing this review. We ordered Squid Masala and Kung Pao Chicken. I don't know what went wrong with the cooking as I ordered (we opted for home delivery) after looking at the rating. But unfortunately it was nowhere near what we (my friend and I) expected. Kung Pao Chicken was far from what it should taste like as it seemed that the cook added sugar more than once.
Just the fact that the food was delivered before the ETA, I persuaded myself in giving a 1.5 rating. That was the only positive regarding the entire process. (Also, I did not feel excited at all to click a photo of the food. So no photos, sorry for that.)

The interiors give an old house feeling-well decked up and charming.
We were already full snd solely wanted to try their food so directly had maincourse and a fresh lime soda.
We had taken Seafood Green Rice,Chilli Garlic Prawn & Dragon Crab.
Food is delicious here and the quantity is sufficient for two.
I loved the crab item.It was spicy but very well cooked.
Service is prompt.

Not many people know about this small continental and sea food joint as it is situated in a place that is little interior. But it's worth a visit if you're looking for good continental and sea food which doesn't cost fancy. 
The menu has a number of continental dishes with a hint of chinese.The bacon wraps,sausages are a must try. One can try their Squid,lamb and pork preparations which comes in a good quantity and are delicious. 
The decor is minimal yet looks impressive. The stuffs are very helpful and offer great service. Though for some preparations you may have to wait for a little longer. 
My experience with the mango tree was pretty impressive and i will definitely recommend this place to everyone.

It's not nearly as popular as it should be.
The place is spacious and classy looking.
And the food is delicious.
We ordered a steak, which included chicken and pork and lamb, all cooked extremely well. And it came with a fried egg! I would definitely return for a second plate of this.
The beverage choices were limited so I had to settle for fresh lime soda. Bo-ring.
The service was good, but it could be faster.
Although the prices are not pocket friendly, this is still my first choice for steak in the city.

It has a fancy menu but absolutely no flavours in the food. It is regular Calcutta style Chinese food. No wine flavour in the chicken in ginger wine sauce, no chilli plum flavour in the crispy chilli plum chicken, no flavour of garlic in the burnt garlic rice which only had crispy burnt garlic garnished on top, which had lost their garlicky flavour. Quite disappointing.

The first thing that I loved here was the spacious interior and how well decorated too-complete with ornate mirrors,pristine carpeted staircase,all white-indoors and beautiful portraits.Coming to the food,we had ordered Chicken Tom Yum Soup and Smoked Chicken.The soup was way too awesome.The right quantity of chicken and the perfect taste.Its adequate for two people though.The Smoked Chicken was good,though nothing extraordinary.But the 8pieces of crunchy and tasty chicken pieces sure killed our appetite for the main course.They have a separate menu for beverages and desserts which are not included on Zomato or on the menu card you get there first and you have to ask for it separately.From that we ordered an Ice Cream Choco Sundae which was too good really,with chocolate icecream and brownie pieces.The staff behaviour was quite cordial too.An added bonus is they allow guests to cut bday cakes brought from outside,so it's also a great option for small birthday celebrations.Altogether a lovely place.Looking forward to visiting here again.

Went there some 1 month ago with my friend. We had a nearbuy coupon. Finding this place is a bit tricky, and is quite far from the main road. As we reached there, the staff members welcomed us and we took our seats. The interior decor is really beautiful, and I would state that is one of the most beautifully decorated restaurants in kolkata. We opted for Manchow soup, which was nice, full of chicken and mushrooms, then we had pan fried chilly chicken which we had as starters, and was disappointed with it. Chickens were chewy and rubbery, hard. Then we had honey and lemon chicken which was also very sweet and did not go well with chicken fried rice. Lastly fresh lime and ice cream were good. Not satisfied at all.

The food was decent. Ham bacon wrapped chicken won my heart. Fish Florentine was nice. Calamari was also tasty. 
We were 7 people altogether and they gave us complementary ice-cream after the meal.
The price is completely reasonable. It's a fine place for a family dinner.

This is a nice hangout place. The ambiance is good with pictures of Frida Kahlo and Van Gogh hanging on the wall. The staffs are friendly too.
The food was decent. Ham bacon wrapped chicken won my heart. Fish Florentine was nice. Calamari was also tasty. 
We were 7 people altogether and they gave us complementary ice-cream after the meal.
The price is completely reasonable. It's a fine place for a family dinner.

Situated in Tollygunge , a bit hard to spot. This little joint has nothing amazing to offer. I find their chinese sides extremely saucy and spicy. And the rice mains are tasteless. Well you definitely expect more at such costs!
Dine in experience was not that bad when it comes down to the deliveries. Had ordered chicken Manchurian and veg fried rice. The quantity was awfully less, like two spoonful of gravy and 6 half bite size pieces of chicken. The rice had frozen veggies in it which weren't even properly thawed before being put to cook. And good god, the amount of sauce they pour into their gravy, the only ingredient they're generous about. Making the sauce industry prosper. :P

It is situated near golf green CCD. The restaurant is not that much large but well decorated and and ambiance is good. The quality and quantity they provide is really good enough. The staff working there are friendly. Overall it's a good restaurant and I will rate 4.0 out of 5.0......

The place is a roof top cafeteria. The entrance of the place is very beautifully decorated with blue lights and bengali rural arts. The interior is decorated with paintings. I tried their crispy lamb, lamb roast and blue lagoon. As I am a great fan of lamb dishes. The roast was well cooked and juicy. The drink was also ok, but not upto the mark. The amazing part was they don't apply any extra charges. Staffs were also polite and they suggested me the dishes.

Visited last night. What a lovely place it was. Food is tasty and one plate noodles/rice(any type) is more than sufficient for 2 people. Well maintained,decorated with full of wall photo frames and hanging big mirrors on the wall, stuffs are very polite and decent, prices are reasonable and the most important thing is "THEY ARE NOT EXTRA CHARGING (SERVICE TAX/VAT/SERVICE CHARGE)" means you have to pay only what you ate .

Went there on Valentine's day. Though giving it's review a bit later. Really liked the place a lot. It is well decorated & the ambience is
also good. One mark deducted because we had to wait a lot although we had a booking before. Coming back to the quality of the food, it was really good. We tried Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken lollypops, Schezwan Rice & Chicken and the food was scrumptious. The staffs were very courteous. Will surely visit it again.

The restaurant was hosting a Japanese Food Weekender by the name 'TRY JAPAN' and we went there today for lunch just to try out their Japanese dishes. Being an ardent lover of Japanese, we ordered only from their special Japanese Menu. 
We ordered Pork Okonomiyaki, Yakitori, Chawan Mushi, Prawn Sushi, Chicken Sushi, Pork Ramen, Seafood Ramen and the Japanese Platter. The food was not only delicious but also authentic. Moreover, in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in the city, their Japanese Menu prices were very cheap but no less in quality. 
I hope that they keep hosting such weekenders so that we can eat authentic Japanese food at pocket friendly prices. :)

P.S. The rating is solely based on their Japanese Menu, which was a special for the weekend. We didn't order anything from their regular menu, so cannot tell anything!

I lucked out today as this day the restaurant was serving Japanese cuisine especially...And my first experience of sushi was marvellous... The limited seating of this place, good music, tasteful seafood variety (eventhough I was never a big fan) amiable waiters and the overall charming decor satiated my taste buds as well as reinstated my faith in the restaurants of this city... Not all of them are out there to burn a hole in your pocket while misguiding and mistreating you. Every bit of the food they serve is worth your penny... So instead of spending on some snooty bistro, give this place a try. 😇

Well , it was a lazy sunday evening and I was out with my friends ,looking for a good meal. Voila , Zomato suggested me *The Mango Tree*. Looked into reviews and ratings and decided to check in. 

Food : 4.5 / 5 - Offering continental , oriental ( chinese , thai cuisine ) . Decent portion size. Tasty. Quality of food will surely make you visit again.

Ambience : 4.5/ 5 - Comfortable and cozy atmosphere. Good for small groups , couples. Located at golf green. There is a rooftop cafeteria.

Service : 4.5 / 5 - Decent and helpful staff. Food is delivered in time.

Money : 4.5 / 5 - Food for 3 costed me Rs 950 , which had noodles , chopsuye , starter and side dish.

It's approximately 15 min walking distance from Tollygaunge metro and quite hard to locate without google maps as it is in the residential area. 

Talking about the interior, decoration is quite impressive. Walls are white painted with popular art works hanging from it. You would also find daily newspaper and some books in the bookshelf in this 2 storyed restaurant. The decoration gives a home like feeling to the visitors. 

I couldn't hold my cravings of trying sea food for any longer, hence I visited this place today. So it was my first time experience of sea food.

We ordered, 
Mixed sea food soup (4/5)
Stir fried crab (4.5/5)
Pan fried octopus (5/5)
Mixed sea food fried rice (3/5)
Squid masala (3.5/5)
Octopus in manchurian sauce (3.5/5)
Sweet lime soda (4/5)
Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce (3.5/5)

Stir fried crab & pan fried octopus were the best in our menu, will recommend to try this two. Courteous stuffs but they need to improve their communication skill a bit. All the foods were served in prompt time except the main course.

Went there few days back. The location is bit difficult to find, its in the lane beside the cafe coffee day. As the name goes so does the place, you will definitely find a big mango tree in the vicinity. The seat arrangements are also good. You can sit in ground floor or if you mind we can go to the first floor. Decorum is quite good so is the ambience. Ambience was bit cosy.

Coming to food, ordered : Chef's Special Bang Bang Chicken, Noodles Gravy and Darsan.
All of them was good. Had gravy chow after a very long time and still found the same taste in it which i liked it. Prices are also reasonable. All and all its a good joint and would recommend this to everyone.

Last evening I went to this place alone. I was hungry and I couldn't tolerate my cravings for Chinese delicacies. Its a small joint and is very difficult to locate. If you're not well acquainted with the area. 

I was welcomed properly by the waiters and they were very polite in their approach. The decor of the place is beautiful. White painted with pictures hanging on the wall,well decorated. 

But the joint is a bit smelly when I entered later on the smell was gone. They have the same things on their menu card like other chinese joints nothing different and I almost guessed it before I entered. 

I choose to play safe I ordered Veg Noodles and Chilli Chicken. The noodles were not properly cooked but the chilli chicken was awesome. From the mocktails I ordered Blue Lagoon as they don't have other alternatives. Alltogether it was an average experience. The bill came around 500/- INR.

Since The Mango Tree is very near to my place, I never had the chance of visiting. But today I went for a family dinner and we chose this place. The entrance is done with lighting and it gives a happy vibe. We were allotted a table in the ground floor. The decor is aesthetically done with lots of paintings. It has a very homely atmosphere and I found the staffs to be courteous. Coming to the food, I felt that the menu card could have been more appealing. We ordered
1. Fresh Lime Soda
2. Crispy chilli babycorn
3. Pan Fried Chilli Fish
4. Mixed Fried Rice
5. Chicken Cantonese Noodles
6. Chicken Manchurian
7. Chicken in chilli oyester sauce
8. Schezwan Fish 
9. Chilli Honey Fish
10. Vanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce
          I found all the items to be quite tasty. The quantity was sufficient and the food was light. I particularly liked the taste of Chilli Honey Fish.
 Decor: 3.5/5
 Food: 4/5 
 Service: 4.5/5

We ordered drums of heaven for the starters and it tasted as good as it is shown in the pic I uploaded. Coming to the main course, we had prawns in schezuan sauce and chicken fried rice. Quantity and quality both were normal, but good. They don't charge any extra tax, so good for the pocket.

Located opposite the tollygunge cemetry. This place is quite decent. Decor and music is pretty good, polite staff and quick service. Had the chilli garlic crab which was tender and tasty. The roasted chilli pork and octopus in Manchurian Sauce was also really good. The mixed noodles and fried rice were fine. Nothing too special about their drinks that we had, the blue lagoon and pineapple blossom. But this place is really worth it.  Overall had a really good lunch and this place is pocket friendly. Definitely coming back for more. 😀

This place is literally a stone's throw away from my place. The most saddening part is it lost its sheen within few years.  They had a great chinese cook, dunno what happened suddenly everything became super oily like those street side fried rice. Continental food is their USP.  But hey, its worth a try atleast once :)

Have ordered home delivery many times - they do an excellent roast mutton and their pork dishes are fabulous. Seafood is also very good and in particular their squid is lovely. Highly recommended

Located opposite the tollygunge cemetry. This place is quite decent. Decor and music is pretty good, polite staff and quick service. Had the chilli garlic crab which was tender and tasty. The roasted chilli pork and octopus in Manchurian Sauce was also really good. The mixed noodles and fried rice were fine. Nothing too special about their drinks that we had, the blue lagoon and pineapple blossom. But this place is really worth it.  Overall had a really good lunch and this place is pocket friendly. Definitely coming back for more. 😀

This place is literally a stone's throw away from my place. The most saddening part is it lost its sheen within few years.  They had a great chinese cook, dunno what happened suddenly everything became super oily like those street side fried rice. Continental food is their USP.  But hey, its worth a try atleast once :)

It was a good experience.. I have never heard the name before going there... A small but cozy restaurant with experimental food... The taste of soup was very good... The pork could have been softer... We had fried rice, Tetrazzini, pork, prawn, chicken... Taste of food was really good.... Suvankar Chakraborty

Went there with a lot of expectation but wasn't satisfied to that extent.
Starters were really good. The hot and sour soup we tried was really good, plus the friend lamb dish was equally tasty. 
Everything went upside down the moment we started with our main course. Green seafood rice tasted nothing like it but like a plain ordinary fried rice. Fish in schezwan sauce was eatable with nothing extra.  Chili prawn was so so. Another rice we took(forgot the name) was just plain and simple in taste so nothing extraordinary to write about the food.
Decor was good, plus the place was clean enough but these thing really don't matter that much when the food you taste is not good enough.

This is a pretty decent little eating joint, providing some serious seafood stuff. Both myself and my wife are seafood lovers and this place gave us just what we wanted. The restaurant is set up in a medieval looking residential house, decorated with beautiful wallpapers and very lively decor.

We ordered for House Special Mixed Seafood Soup, Cantonese Seafood Noodles, Octopus in Manchurian Sauce and a glass each of Pina Colada. Everything was too good and savoury. The pricing too is pretty decent and does not poke a hole in your pocket. 

We are definitely coming here back for more seafood.

This place is a hidden gem in Tollygunge area.
I loved their decor it's very pretty, and also has a happy and soothing ambience. 
The Mango Tree serves good quality food.
I had ordered Chef's special bang bang chicken for starters, mixed fried rice, chicken in devil's sauce and honey lemon chicken. All the dishes were equally tasty and delectable.
To sum up, The Mango Tree is a beautiful, pocket friendly restaurant which serves varities of palatable dishes.
Visit the restaurant and see it for yourself.

So this place is a good place indeed, with a very nice name to suit it too.

Located at a very spottable location, when you are going to Tollygunge from Jadavpur, you'll be able to see it for sure. It's just opposite to the golf green cemetary, eerie yet? But no. Their decor is appealing, especially with their Freida Kahlo painting, as well as some of Van Gogh. Shout out to the art people to have a look. Staffs are courteous enough as they would cater to your need whenever required.

So me and my friend hopped onto this restaurant as we were in Tollygunge and we wanted to try this place. We were greeted by a nice soothing interior and a great lot of nice paintings(as I mentioned earlier). Wanted to check out the st floor however, it was closed that day. 

We started off by ordering crispy konjee chicken. They arrived in a considerably okay amount of time. I won't say very quick, but the serving time was pretty okay. No complains there. For the quantity they served, it was apt. Yet the price could be slightly less as compared to the quantity. They served the right quantity for a starter, not to become too full even before you start eating your food. Finished that to a main course of burnt garlic fried rice and Sweet and sour chicken. Now the fried rice was of a good quantity, however the side dish was pretty less considering that it's supposed to be eaten with the fried rice. The chicken size was veeery less too and it was very sour as compared to sweet. However, we finished the chicken dish too quick as the quantity was not too much. Next came the dessert- Could possibly increase the choices of the dessert slightly more, as it was quite less. But nonetheless we ordered, vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and it was good as usual as you cannot possibly go wrong with it.

The pocket pinch was pretty good too, it was around 680 rupees for all the food that we had and it was not OTT. you don't feel so full after eating that you cannot walk or need a cigarette after that. 

Overall, the experience was nice. Pros and cons are definitely there, but it's worth trying out for. I would go again, for sure, but this time would like to see the quantity to be slightly more in the side dish this time and the chicken pieces to be bigger! You can never have enough of big chicken pieces!

Cheers!

Hopped in with my folks  for dinner yesterday. Nice decor, polite staff n quick service. For starters we had pepper chicken n golden fried prawn. Soft, crispy n cooked perfectly. Next we ordered mixed schezwan rice n chilly garlic noodles n I liked them both. We also had chef's special bang bang chicken on the staff's recommendation . It was good but nothing special about it. Pocket pinch is not that high. Will visit again.

Charmed by the ratings and comments from Zomato...Next restaurant on my wishlist was this one. Location was easy and straight forward...The outer look of the restaurant was nothing fancy..But the inner ambience had a nice cozy homely feeling,decorated with dim lights, comfy wooden chairs and tables and framed paintings on the wall.
 Coming to the food... My taste buds had been longing for both continental and seafood for a while..So for starters I ordered house special squid and octopus fry...Both was succulent..And adequate amount of spices were there. We opted for bacon wrapped lamb, chicken Tetrazzini and spaghetti with mustard and cream sauce.the lamb was excellent...The Tetrazzini was a bit heavier for stomach but thoroughly tasty.. 
The best thing bout this food joint is, all d prices are inclusive of taxes and even then it does not create a hole in your pocket! 
I liked the behavior of d stuffs as well.. They were courteous ..Helpful and smiling.service was quick enuf.
I would gladly recommend this restaurant to my fellow foodies. Would like to return soon! Cheers :D

Had a really hard time to locate the place.Located near bangur hospital,the place is kinda cute.Good decors,good ambiance and a huge mango tree at the gate to welcome you.Ambiance is homely, staffs are courteous and the good part is their menu which is inclusive of tax 😝
We ordered:
Cheff's special bang bang chicken-Extremely delicious,chicken was soft,marinated,spicy...total yum.
Seafood green rice-I feel they could have added a lil more salt..otherwise ok.
Schezwan crab-Star of the evening... Extremely soft..I felt like m having fish instead of crab.Shells were easily removable and the taste was amazing.
Darsan with ice cream-Quantity was too much,darsan was well cooked and ice cream compliments the dish very well.
We had all these for 790 bucks...
So if you want to taste good seafood cuisine by saving a few bucks,this is just the place!!😊
Would definitely visit it again.

Starting from the entrance i loved their ambience. Well decorated though the place is quite small. There were only four tables. Service was good. Tried their smoked chicken, it was mouth watering. But i didn't like the blue lagoon. Dessert was good. It is situated beside the bangoor hospital. Overall good experience. Plus they don't charge tax. So you have to only pay for food. So yeah that's a plus 👍👍

I haven't tasted any good preparation with bacon yet so we also ordered bacon wrapped lamb and it was more delicious than I expected.

A cozy place , separated from the loudness of the daily Kolkata traffic....this place is a real find! Housed in reality under a Mango Tree,as faascinating as it gets,this place offers succulent food in a serene environment. The decors have a Classic white feeling which gives a feeling that it may drain ur pocket out..but idt doesnt!😎.. What it does is that it enriches ur hungry taste buds!.. We ordered on an eventful day...
Smoked Crab- as starter...which was Adventurous ..a hi 5!.
Chicken chilli garlic noodles- Which is a heaven for spicy ppl..it was brilliant but it did bring out tears..😈.
Pork in chili plum sauce- the sauce was a good company for the noodles..i wud suggest better succulent pieces of pork...else its a nice dish out of the box..🤘
To sum up.. am definitely on my way a 2nd time to try the other ones in the menu..I blv this place wont dishearten you.. do pay a visit!! Happy eating healthy living ppl!!!!😄 ...With Nabanita Ghorai 😄

First how to find the place....take a metro ride to tollygunj and then auto-rickshaw (tollygunj to jadavpur).The rickshaw driver shall drop you (5 min in auto rickshaw from tollygunj).
We entered the Resturant by 4 pm.
We were said that the upstairs are closed and we had to sit at  the ground floor.The place was not spacious and the décor was not up to the mark.
We ordered,
Calamari...taste was good but it smelled nasty(santas was far better)
Crispy conzy chicken...it was delicious
Grilled chicken with coriander salsa... Chicken was good but the garlic bread which was served along with was GREAT.
Sea food noodle..amount was good with plenty of squids,prawns.
House special steak...was totally different from what I had at other places.it felt like having sausages,but the taste was good.
Finally we ordered a tutti fruity and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate..really good.
Overall a good place  and pocket friendly. It cost us around 
1600 for 4 people.no service tax and no vat.

They have basically converted a small house into an eatery and so each floor of the three-storied house has 3-5 tables. The ambiance was nice. I felt that the restaurant lacked staff as only one waiter was serving three tables simultaneously which was causing a bit delay in the food serving process but he was well mannered and courteous so that made up for it.

Coming to the food part, we ordered
1. Pan-Fried Octopus
2. Crispy Conji Lamb
3. Roast Pork Rib Chops
4. House Special Steak

It was the first time that I ordered Octopus and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but after the Pan-Fried Octopus arrived, and I tasted it, all the inhibitions went away. The dish was awesome, crispy and coated with a sauce that made it very tempting. The Crispy Conji Lamb was also delicious but to be frank, after having the Octopus, it felt okay compared to it.

For the main course, we went with Roast Pork Rib Chops which had this big piece of Pork which was so soft and well prepared and the taste will definitely stick to your mouth. The other one, House Special Steak was also good and the portions were perfect for two people.

So to conclude, it was a great place and although it looked really small compared to some other restaurants, the availability of every dish and their tastes made up for the other small shortcomings and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Lastly, the menu uploaded here in Zomato is smaller compared to the original menu provided at the restaurant. They have a ton of dishes you can choose from.
P.S. - They have no tax! So whatever price is written on the menu, you will be charged only that :)

This place is located quiet far from the main road, very tricky to spot this outlet. Visited this eatery with lots of expectation, the ambience looked good, but disappointed with their food. Ordered cream of chicken soup which tasted horrible, lumps of cornflour floating on the soup - have to return the whole soup, however they did not charge for this item. The taste of bacon cheeese pancake was much better, but served with too much of dried herbs and that also with chinese sweet sour chilli sause on the side. Only the bacon prawn pasts was yummy. Service is too slow.

Though located at the corner of an alley(making it a bit difficult to locate), its an excellent food joint...
Calm, Cozy, peaceful... With a very warm and hospitable ambience...
We ordered a Calamari and Stir Fried Octopus...The Calamari being a little different from what you will normally expect is balsamic, whilst the latter has a piquant flavour.. .both being extremely delectable ...
We also had Pasta prepared in cream mustard sauce, and Lamb in Devil's sauce...
The pasta had a mellow mustard flavour, with an awesome taste, and the Lamb had a tang sapid taste to it...
Being a mixture of Seafood, Continental and Oriental... Enjoyed to its last bite...
The service is very good...
Overall, an excellent place, with appetizing dishes,,, which will surely leave an aftertaste...
Recommend this place to the people who are always finding for a good place, to have a pleasant meal amidst a snug ambience...

Hidden and out of the place. Those are the cons...now that we've got that out of the way, here's my review:
 Food: Excellent. Do try the continental dishes. I had tried the Octupus Pan fry and Pork to mention a few. They're one of the best I've tried. Squid was good too. The Chinese is as expected. Tasty but normal. If you want to get the best experience out of this...do try the seafood and continental dishes as mentioned above.

Ambience: Well it's small and made in a flat. So don't expect too much. But quite reasonable for families and friends alike. 

Final verdict: Go for the seafood and continental and you definitely won't be disappointed. I can't stress enough how good it is.

First how to find the place....take a metro ride to tollygunj and then auto-rickshaw (tollygunj to jadavpur).The rickshaw driver shall drop you (5 min in auto rickshaw from tollygunj).
We entered the Resturant by 4 pm.
We were said that the upstairs are closed and we had to sit at  the ground floor.The place was not spacious and the décor was not up to the mark.
We ordered,
Calamari...taste was good but it smelled nasty(santas was far better)
Crispy conzy chicken...it was delicious
Grilled chicken with coriander salsa... Chicken was good but the garlic bread which was served along with was GREAT.
Sea food noodle..amount was good with plenty of squids,prawns.
House special steak...was totally different from what I had at other places.it felt like having sausages,but the taste was good.
Finally we ordered a tutti fruity and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate..really good.
Overall a good place  and pocket friendly. It cost us around 
1600 for 4 people.no service tax and no vat.

They have basically converted a small house into an eatery and so each floor of the three-storied house has 3-5 tables. The ambiance was nice. I felt that the restaurant lacked staff as only one waiter was serving three tables simultaneously which was causing a bit delay in the food serving process but he was well mannered and courteous so that made up for it.

Coming to the food part, we ordered
1. Pan-Fried Octopus
2. Crispy Conji Lamb
3. Roast Pork Rib Chops
4. House Special Steak

It was the first time that I ordered Octopus and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but after the Pan-Fried Octopus arrived, and I tasted it, all the inhibitions went away. The dish was awesome, crispy and coated with a sauce that made it very tempting. The Crispy Conji Lamb was also delicious but to be frank, after having the Octopus, it felt okay compared to it.

For the main course, we went with Roast Pork Rib Chops which had this big piece of Pork which was so soft and well prepared and the taste will definitely stick to your mouth. The other one, House Special Steak was also good and the portions were perfect for two people.

So to conclude, it was a great place and although it looked really small compared to some other restaurants, the availability of every dish and their tastes made up for the other small shortcomings and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Lastly, the menu uploaded here in Zomato is smaller compared to the original menu provided at the restaurant. They have a ton of dishes you can choose from.
P.S. - They have no tax! So whatever price is written on the menu, you will be charged only that :)

This place is located quiet far from the main road, very tricky to spot this outlet. Visited this eatery with lots of expectation, the ambience looked good, but disappointed with their food. Ordered cream of chicken soup which tasted horrible, lumps of cornflour floating on the soup - have to return the whole soup, however they did not charge for this item. The taste of bacon cheeese pancake was much better, but served with too much of dried herbs and that also with chinese sweet sour chilli sause on the side. Only the bacon prawn pasts was yummy. Service is too slow.

Though located at the corner of an alley(making it a bit difficult to locate), its an excellent food joint...
Calm, Cozy, peaceful... With a very warm and hospitable ambience...
We ordered a Calamari and Stir Fried Octopus...The Calamari being a little different from what you will normally expect is balsamic, whilst the latter has a piquant flavour.. .both being extremely delectable ...
We also had Pasta prepared in cream mustard sauce, and Lamb in Devil's sauce...
The pasta had a mellow mustard flavour, with an awesome taste, and the Lamb had a tang sapid taste to it...
Being a mixture of Seafood, Continental and Oriental... Enjoyed to its last bite...
The service is very good...
Overall, an excellent place, with appetizing dishes,,, which will surely leave an aftertaste...
Recommend this place to the people who are always finding for a good place, to have a pleasant meal amidst a snug ambience...

So we had visited The Mango Tree 3 weeks back and i was a bit skeptical on the whereabouts of this restaurant at the first stance ..

Location - It is  definitely located a bit off-beat, but actually not at all difficult to locate if you have GPS or basic geography in your brains, so a 4 on 5
Ambience - Simple and charming. It is not that amazing, but there's a peace to it and that's all what you need at a restaurant .. to eat and have a meaningful conversation .. 4 on 5
Food Quality and Presentation - We have actually been here twice. Presentation is decent enough. The quality was too good in the first instance but dropped down a bit in this case. Now, it maybe a one off case but overall, the quality is actually quite good and so, again a 4 on 5.
Value for Money - Absolutely yes. Given the quantity of food that these people serve w.r.t. the price, it is absolutely a value for money deal. 4.5 on 5.
Service - We went once on a normal course and once on a Group-on voucher. In many voucher cases, you do tend to get a lack of service from the staff due to reduced commissions. In our case, we were startled by the polite gesture and service of the staff members. Now, there was not much crowd and i have no clue as to how they would have behaved if there were increased numbers, but for me, it was a 5 on 5.

Overall, a nice off-beat place that would definitely attract repeat clientele irrespective of location.

You have to be really carefull to notice this place because it camouflages pretty much with the neighborhood. The mango tree, is a cosy homely place, small yet serving good seafood dishes. 
We ordered for grilled fish (picture included) and fish Florentine. These were served along with garlic bread.
The Grilled Fish - tender and flavorful bhekti, grilled perfectly, served with sauteed veggies , garlic bread and lemon butter sauce. Now I have had better lemon butter sauces, but I can do with this as well. On a whole, a filling and tasty dish.
Fish Florentine - I have sincereley tasted way better preparations of the same. It had a little overdose of spinach puree , it almost was running through... the amount of cheese was pretty good..and fish had nothing to complain about. Just the consistency! 
The garlic bread was a USP! so we ordered for a plate extra! 

Ambience is homely, you guys please improve the air conditioning system or else it is a bit stuffy when full. 
Otherwise go grab a plate of seafood here.. it'll be worth it!

Just back from Pune for a Pujo break , and dying for some good Chinese food at home, fired up the Zomato app and found this place with good ratings and reviews . I have always trusted Zomato with it's ratings , so went ahead and ordered from The Mango Tree.
The order was short with Mixed fried rice and Fish Manchurian , and I have to admit the food was totally amazing . It just made me super happy to taste some good Chinese after a really really long time and my mood was set for the rest of the stay !

Amazing job you guys :-)

This restaurant is situated in the bye-lanes of Golf Gardens near Cafe Coffee Day. The decor is simple and homely and has an English feel to it. 
We tried both Oriental and Continental and both were equally good. We ordered Drums of heaven, PAN fried chilli fish, noodles(Hakka), lemon chicken and grilled fish. The food was very good and the service was fast. 
This is truly a hidden gem and trust me, if you visit this place, you will not go back disappointed.

But we also ordered some chili chicken they weren't soft the chicken was a bit stretchy.
But overall a nice experience, the staff was nice and friendly. And the price is reasonable.

I keep ordering from here via swiggy, but this was my second visit to the restaurant. Nestled in one corner of bikramgarh, they have utilized the space quite well. The ambiance is very peaceful and soothing to the eyes.
I ordered the bacon wrap with chicken.  It was truly creamy and contending. I also ordered Egg hakka noodles which was moderately nice and lamb in Devil's sauce which was not tender. I've also had chicken tetrazinni, fish florentile and chicken steak from here. I feel, their continental dishes are really good, but the Chinese is just average. Also, the service is very very slow, mostly because they cater to the swiggy delivery.Looking forward to having better chinese next week, i have a coupon booked already.

you will definitely fail to locate this place if you don't know bikramgarh well. it was a puja visit and here i came across
-entire building is utilized as a restaurant and a place for hookah. this place has a non ac ground floor and full ac first floor which is spacious, moderately decorated. 
-weird name isn't it ? :|
-stuffs were humble and cooperative. 
-a heaven of seafood lovers. but beside the quality of chowman or santa's fantasia,  it is slight low in the measurement scale but inconsiderable.
-schezwan chicken came with thick gravy. that was satisfactory. kalamari squid was great and goes well as starter. the quantity of chicken rice surprised us. the first expression i heard from my mate was "seems we have to pack the rice for home" 
-two people in 700. 
- in the neighborhood , there are many eateries but when it comes to good seafood in reasonable price, i'll prefer this one.

Situated on the auto route of Tollygunge-Jadavpur, this restaurant serves quality food at a reasonable price. Four of us ordered two starters (crispy chilli baby corn & pepper chicken), two main dishes (veg schezwan rice & veg chilli garlic noodles), two side dish (hot garlic & honey-lemon chicken) and two fresh lime soda. The bill was around Rs. 1400 and the quantity of the main course was sufficient for four. The crispy chilli baby corn tasted heavenly. The honey lemon chicken and schezwan rice (though spicy) was very light. There was oil dripping from the noodles which was extremely spicy and also the chicken pieces were not very large, rather less that satisfactory size. These two things slightly lowered the rating. Otherwise as a whole, the experience was very good. The staff were polite and helpful and the ambience was peaceful with instrumental oldies playing in the background stereo.

On 25th September went to The Mango Tree while returning to our way home from South City.It was around 9.45pm while we entered there. The place is very clean and the sitting chairs are cozy enough to
spend quite a few hours in dining. We ordered
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Fried Rice & Chicken Manchurian. The soup was good but not comparable, the rice can be compared with most of
the well known Chinese restaurants in the city but I was disappointed with the chicken dish. The chicken pieces were small, while the juicy,tenderness was missing.The Manchurian gravy was tasty though.
Hope again someday I may visit this place to try their crab, prawn and pork items.

After having seafood from ecstasea and santa's fantasea, we thought of going to this restaurant which i have bookmarked for a long time.. so, yesterday evening, i and a friend of mine went there at around 4.. The direction is a little tricky but we managed to reach there... the place from outside looked really beautiful... but as we went inside.. we saw the restaurant to be full as the place is very small.. So we were escorted to the 3rd floor as they said that was the cafe... we were running late, so we agreed.. when we reached there, we found that it was a small place where people were having hookah.. And as seen in hookah parlours, the tables are low in height which is not atall apt for having food... So, we were really annoyed at that time on how they can even think that we can have food in those small table arrangements with so much difficulties... we said that we will wait.. So the boys told us to wait outside.. there were benches outside but there r high chances of u to fall in dengue if u sit there fr long.. the outside was full of mosquitoes and other flies..
Then finally our turn came and we sat inside.. the interior was very nice with beautiful sketches..
Now, coming to the food.. we ordered a seafood green rice and a semi gravy squid masala..
The rice was nothing extraordinary.. though very flavourful but very dry... and the squid masala was also nothing extraordinary... overall.. the food was good but nothing mentionable... but the squid masala and the seafood green rice goes pretty well together so would surely recommend these dishes.

The Mango Tree is a food joint located on golf green close to Bangur Hospital...auto is the best transport for this restaurant to visit...there is also a lot of space for car parking...

The décor of the restaurant is very nice...the Ambience is very much appreciated...comprising with a soft music at the background...this restaurant also have a cafeteria section and also a rooftop section for private party ....

This is a joint where u can enjoy ur food without any disturbances...the place is quite calm....

The waiters were very decent...they know how to satisfy the customers....

Coming back to the food we have ordered smoked fish, chicken fried rice, schezuan chicken, and in desert we have ordered tutti fruity...
All the items were fabulous...the fish items were melting down...and the desert were excellent...

I loved this joint...the price is really cheap and affordable...and they have no tax and service charge as well...

I would love to visit this joint again...and would suggest my friend also to visit this place....

Managed to finally visit The Mango Tree. If you're looking for good continental cuisine which is also easy on the pocket this is the place to be. Roasted chilli pork and Pork ribs are a must try although the quantity of spaghetti was disappointing. It's a small restaurant with earthly decor and limited space which might hamper your privacy.

This food joint has as a connection with ECSTASEA & SANTA'S FANTASEA.I think this food joint belongs to the same owner of those two food joints.This eatery is located on golfgreen,close to BANGUR HOSPITAL.There would be plenty of space for car parking. The JADAVPUR-TOLLYGUNGE AUTOS would be the best option to reach there. The eatery was well decorated,sitting available on both the ground floor & first floor.The attendants were cordial.Serving time was real quick.The smoked Fish was outstanding.Fried calamari was great.I had tried seafood fried rice which was delicious.One bowl of rice can be shared with another person.ambience was just what you need to have dining,calm & noiseless.Another reason for which i could visit this eatery again  was the pricing.Really a pocket friendly restaurant.800 ruppes will be the cost for two people(approx).

This joint was in bucket list for quite some time...finally managed to drop by. The location is bit odd but hardly matters for a gourmet like me .The restro has got three floors. Interior decor and illumination is quite impressive. Dishes tastes very decent . Pricing is fair. Waiters are courteous. All together a nice experience.

A quaint little & cosy place, many a people might give it a miss as it lies at the corner of the street connecting Bangur hospital from Golf Green. The decor is subtle & tastefully done. You have variety of choices in terms of seafood.. And I being quite an experimental person, ordered the seafood green noodles and grilled fish with caper sauce.. 
I had been missing calamari since quite a while, so it was an obvious choice with a new addition of octopus. The quite was enough to be shared with three. The squids tastes delicious but I have my reservations for octopus. Maybe that's the way it tastes.. 😊
The grilled fish was juicy and the tastes were balanced perfectly.. A first time visit to Mango Tree but definitely not the last one..

This joint was in bucket list for quite some time...finally managed to drop by. The location is bit odd but hardly matters for a gourmet like me .The restro has got three floors. Interior decor and illumination is quite impressive. Dishes tastes very decent . Pricing is fair. Waiters are courteous. All together a nice experience.

Interesting name, with equally interesting décor, this place is actually a residential house turned into a restaurant. In the process, they have incorporated a mango tree that was a part of the old house (hence the name, I guess). The menu they will hand you is pretty ordinary. Any place that serves continental will have similar dishes. The thing that is extra-ordinary about this place is the quality and the taste. It may be a bit difficult to locate if you are new in the Golf Green area, but that has never been a hindrance to a food from food. The mixed sea food soup (house special) was the first one to arrive, followed by Crab in Butter Garlic sauce, Herb and Parmesan crusted Fish and Pan Fried Octopus left us all happy. Their food is absolute delectable and the staff very friendly. If you are planning to visit soon, try their sea food, they are marvelous. I am planning to visit again, to explore their other dishes.

A beautifully decorated, nice place well worthy of being part of the hidden gems collection of Zomato. The smoked chicken is unique and delicious. Chilli garlic noodles and seafood noodles are excellent too.  The only thing was that service seemed a bit slow even though we had pre ordered. Although since we were a group of 11, not much to complain about. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. Overall a place to visit again and again.

If you manage to find The Mango Tree don't leave before you try out their splendid continental spread. Priced moderately this joint is a must for foodies looking for something new. Although, the absence of proper steak knives is a bit of a hassle, specially if you order pork ribs, like we did. I hope the management looks into this. Will certainly want to come back when in the neighbourhood.

This is a cute little place in the lanes of golf green beside Bangur hospital. They are specialised in seafood and continental. We ordered both as well as chinese. Quantity is good. But as per taste in seafood I think Santas fantasea does more justice. Their hospitality is very well. Due to heavy rains they were having electricity problems so the lights were going onn and off. Due to this inconvenience they gave free ice -creams to all of us. ♥ And and the best part is they dont charge added tax or service tax. It was overall a nice experience but could have been better.

The restaurant is situated at a very homely and soothing environment. The inner dacoration is based on fusion of Victorian style and old cave painting style. The parallel walls of both side of the main entrance is beautifully decorated with paintings..which potrays the essence of bengal by appearing as 'alpona'....then right from the entrance of the seating area, it's all based on white color n vectorian style of decoration.

The foods were tasty and of good quantity... we ordered--  Fresh Lime Soda,Sweet Corn Chicken Clear Soup,Smoked Chicken, Haka Chicken Noodles, Chef Special Bang Bang Chicken.. 
The staffs are humble & courteous... a decent and good place to visit with family and friends.

The Mango Tree one of the hidden gem in Tollygunge Area.
The small lane beside Bangur Hospital will lead you the this place..
Outside of the place is very simple. A Mango tree is present at the door. Interior decor is done very well gives a 1980s feeling.

Place was clean and service was fast and good.

We ordered Fried Crispy Fish which was marinated Vetki Fish coated in Corn Flakes, served with Mayonnaise. Taste was very good and portions size were perfect.
Bacon Wrapped Prawn is very different served here from any other eateries in Kolkata.
5-6 pcs marinated Prawns wrapped in a huge bacon sheet. Taste was brilliant.

Chef's special Bang Bang Chicken didn't banged my tastebuds because it was so ordinary. Chicken was dry, had fibers. Taste was too salty.

Corn mushroom fried rice prepared well and tasted good.

We ordered Lime soda at first but served at last, thats a bit disappointment.

Tried their home delivery for (1) Bacon wrapped Prawn (2) Prawn fried rice & (3) Pork Chops. The bacon wrapped prawn was decent enough; the fried rice was excessively dry BUT the Pork Chops were a MEGA DISASTER ITEM - full of muddy tasteless sauce, oodles of lard and stiff meat on the pork. Decided that this was the first & the last time I'll ever order from this joint. Incidentally, before this we had one evening visited the place with the intention of having dinner but had walked iut due to the overpowering stench of food in the restaurant sitting area. This proves that we were right in refusing to have food there!

I visited the place with my friends on 7th August,2016.
The restaurant is a converted residential building with seating arrangements both in the ground floor and the first floor.We had Fried calamari, smoked chicken, roasted pork rib chops, mixed green seafood rice,mixed chilly garlic noodles, butter garlic crab and chilly lamb.The price was reasonable and the food was as amazing as it could have been.
The staff were friendly and even helped us choose wisely.There's also a rooftop cafe but sadly it was closed and we couldn't visit that.
But,I loved the place anyway and plan to visit it with my friends again soon.

Situated near the Tollygunge metro station (more precisely, the narrow lane beside Bangur Hospital will take you to The Mango Tree) , this is a hidden gem and an addition to the many small but great eateries of South Kolkata.
The food was too delicious to describe, and, that too at such affordable price.
We had ordered Fried Calamari, which was great. The Smoked Chicken was lovely. The roasted pork ribs chop was very juicy. We also had a delicious Crab in butter garlic sauce, some good panfried noodles and mixed green seafood rice, each of which were great and lip-smacking. The chilly lamb was so well cooked and delicious. The staffs were very nice and helpful and helped us to choose wisely. Altogether, the experience was wonderful. I recommend this place to everyone. And I plan to visit it many more times.

My top picks are house special mixed sea food soup,  hunan crab,  diced chicken in assorted pepper and chicken cheesy roastie. 
All of them are good. 

I am yet to try out other dishes,  including oysters and squid which I will do during my next visits.

I went there on a Seafood offer bought from Nearbuy(formerly known as Groupon). 
The restaurant is located at a very known place accessible from Tollygunge, Bikramgarh, Bijoygarh and Lake Gardens.
The ambience is good. Interiors are well decorated but lacks in space. 
The service was good & quick enough.
But what makes this restaurant an odd one out , is the quality of the food.
This is the first time I've been tasting squids & octopus..
The food is so tasty & mouth watering.
There's one more thing for the foodies, the restaurant is tax free.  :D

This is one of the Hidden Gems of Kolkata. I accidentally discovered it while taking a detour due to heavy traffic on the normal route. So we went there impromptu looking for good food, not too much in the way of expectations. The quality that they served was very much a surprise and add to that the friendly pricing and u have a winner here. We were taken aback at their menu card finding continental as well as oriental and Indian cuisines. Our love for continental saw us order  Bacon wrapped chicken, chilli garlic crab and the House special steak. Completely satisfied with each of the items, the crab was spicy, the bacon wrap was a highlight as the vacancy was so thin and juicy and along with a honey dip it tasted fantastic, the steak also was very good with a variety of meat provided, the Pork sausages went very well with the chicken. It was a excellent dining experience, and I've visited this some 2-3 times and would love to visit again.
P.S. It looks like they have redone their menu, now that I check again on zomato - time for another visit maybe :P .

This place was on my bucket list for a long time. And this time zomato showed me some love (for reviewing various food places on their site )by sending me an open voucher worth Rs.800 for this nice food joint .so we hit this place this Sunday night. The place is located right next to the ally of r .n bangur hospital gate no 2.(if u r coming from rabindra sarobar metro stn). Its a small 2 storied restaurant that basically offers Chinese cuisine. We went for masala squid, house spcl squid (calamari), pan fried octopus and bacon wrap (chicken). We liked d taste of calamari, the Crispiness of masala squid .pan fried octopus was a bit too sweet for our taste buds.bt the show stealer was d bacon wrap. It was absolute delicacy. The faintly smoky flavoured bacon wrapping the small bits of chicken and cheese is melting out from the wrap ....its pure poetry. I wish I could have more. Bt my stomach did not co operate with me .
The server was polite and it was overall a nice and fulfilling experience.

Even the haka noodles that's mostly served in a very mundane manner elsewhere, is definitely an exception here.Well tossed with chicken and veggies the noodles lived upto our expectation.The gingery flavor of the Ginger Wine Chicken is delectable.Looking forward to my next visit here to try the variety of seafood,Mango Tree has to offer.

The mango tree is a nice and cosy place to hang out at Golf Green. In amidst of many finest eateries now a days at Kolkata this place deserves a special mention. The only thing which I didn't personally like is the loud music. One can try hookah as well. Quite a comfortable place to chat with our friends. 😊

A quiet place by the cemetery in the golf green region. Falls on the auto route from Tollygunge Metro. Hard to stop though. Three storied place with ample space and a cosy environment. The staff was attentive and quick with the service. Well decorated space will wall art giving the place an upscale finish.
Coming to the food it was nothing extraordinary but doesn't disappoint either. The sweet and sour chicken was too sweet for my liking and the mixed Fried Rice felt dry and had more egg than chicken. The food came in ample quantities though. Moreover good place for a quick hangout or a date but definitely not the place if you want really tasty food with good aroma.

I have ordered a couple of times from here and went there once. The place is beautifully decorated but service was slow. We had ordered Roasted Chili Pork, Squid Masala, House Special Squid Fry, and Chicken Fried Rice. The House Special Squid Fry was good and the pork was tasty. But all the other dishes were ordinary. And the quantity was nothing great compared to the price. 

If you are looking for a new place to try out, you may wanna go here. But it's nothing extraordinary. There is a lot of room for improvement.

Go there only if you love batter laden Bangali Chinese. And oh, if you order Fried Calamari what you will really get is a Butter Garlic Calamari, the Bacon Wrapped Chicken is really a ham roll with chicken and bacon inside, the Prawn Stir Fry is a crispy corn flour coated mess in sweet garlic sauce. And no, you can't tell them. They of course know better. Pretty place though.

Paid a visit to this place a month ago at evening time rather to say for an early dinner. The decor is really soothing with white walls victorian style nd nice seating arrangements. We opt for the restaurant instead of the cafe which they offer at the 1st floor of the building. Food quality is good. Choice of food: hunan lamb, pan fried octopus-delicious, seafood noodles. Though they has served us seafood rice instead, but on enquiring, they changed it within 10mins. Overall nice experience for an evening date.

came here last night, the location is not that difficult to find it's just close to the golf garden ccd. 
the restaurant looks quite good from the outside, and the ambience inside is also quite homely. coming to the food i liked the pork preparations the most as it's my favorite. do try the masala squid & roasted chili pork here, it's delicious. i liked the rice noodles here the most, and the chili garlic noodles was good too but the rice was not upto the mark in comparison to the noodles.
the only reason i'm not giving it a 5 star is that the service was too slow. other than that everything here deserves a thumbs up.

This was on my list for a long time. It took me a while to figure out it's location and I got there with the help of Google maps.
Got many recommendations and read good reviews about this place but I was surprised to find out that I was the only customer at that time. 
Anyway very well decorated both the floors.
Ordered roast pork rib chops & lamb roast. It took about 20-25 mins to prepare. Lamb roast was so so but pork rib chops is one of bests.
Looking forward to try seafood next time.

Tucked in a corner of the lane near bangur hospital,this restaurant is a place that will surprise you! 

The ambiance is bright and well lit. Paintings adorn the walls and chandeliers hang from the ceiling.

We settled for Oriental cuisine. Food we ordered were chicken sweet corn soup, drums of heaven, chicken fried rice, chef's special bang bang chicken along with coke and fresh lime soda! For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. 

The drums of heaven was delicious. 6 pieces tossed in a moderately spiced gravy definitely leaves you craving for more. 
The soup was thick and tasted perfect.
The fried rice came with an amazing quantity and was pretty decent in taste.
The bang bang chicken wasn't spicy as they said it would be. However it was not bad in taste.
The other things need no elaborate description. 

The service was nice and warm. 

P.s. If you plan to have a four course meal, you might not finish everything. Quantity is pretty huge! :D

A recommendation, obviously!

I have finally found that restaurant-near-my-house where I would like to visit on every occasion henceforth. For a long time I had avoided going to this restaurant because of a poor food review from someone. But I am happy that I had finally ventured into this place last weekend. 

Location- tucked in a small corner in Lake Gardens area just opposite to a Cafe Coffee Day outlet. entrance is small- can be missed out. 

Ambiance- Excellent. A residential house converted into a restaurant. Inside decorations are very warm and homely. A soothing music plays in the background. The staffs are very courteous and give privacy to the customers.

Food- Now the main part which impressed me immensely. We had ordered Sea food Korean soup (with shrimp, squid and octopus) and smoked fish for starter. The quantity was sufficient for two people. The soup was mild in taste with the spicy lemon-grass flavoured grilled fish which complemented the taste. 
For main course we had ordered Grilled Fish with herb and caper sauce(which is a full platter), egg wrapped chicken fried rice and chilly lamb. The grilled fish dish was served with veggies and garlic bread and tasted heavenly. The fish was of excellent quality, super soft with mild lemony flavour. People should really really try out this dish. The other two dishes were equally tasty. The rice was mildly flavoured, and the chilly lamb was much much beyond my expectations. The gravy of the lamb was one of the best I had ever had and tasted good with the garlic bread as well. We ended the wonderful dinner with vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce. 

Pocket pinch- Extremely reasonable compared with the taste and quality of food they serve. All the above dishes together came for just Rs. 1300.

I cannot wait to visit Mango Tree again and taste all their other delicacies.

The decoration and ambience is nice. The staircase is also very sweetly decorated.
Somehow I did not like the taste of food much. The quality of food is good though. Pork was soft juicy with proper flavour and seasoning. Really liked it. The crispy conjee chicken was okay. I did not like the seafood noodles. The squid, octopus, prawn n other meat was fine, well cooked and tasted good but the noodle was not properly boiled. It was hard. The noodle strands did nt hav the flavour that shud be there. Their sides are better than the main dishes somehow! Heard it from friends aswell.

A quite cozy homely place located amidst the hum drum of the city life, Mango tree is a must visit place for all foodie and art lovers. The decor is minimalist and tasteful; music is not too loud, food is better than any 5 star restaurants and service is fabulous as well. 
Try out their seafood section - Octopus and stir fried Kalamari. And for those who likes to play safe and stick to chicken or fish, you can have the steak or the grilled fish/fish and chips. Food quality is good and pocket pinch..not much.
If you are thirsty, go for the simple Fresh Lime soda (salty) which is the best of all the fresh lime sodas that I had ever tasted.
Desert options are not much but you can try the special sundae which contains a tall glass filled up to the brim with slices of brownie, chocolate/vanilla ice cream - topped with a chocolate sauce which is nothing like the chocolate sauce we had tasted earlier.
It is a family restaurant where you can spend a nice quite time with your family or friends.

I went there with my family after reading positive response on zomato. Seriously speaking we felt it overrated.  We took
 Chilly baby corn, pan fried octopus, chicken in white wine , Bang bang chicken and chicken fried rice. Well the quality of the food was good. But what i didn't like was the sauce . i found serious problem with the gravy part. Most of the dishes tasted same moreover i didn't like the food because of the sauce. The chicken in white wine was a serious mess. It was so awful that we couldn't even finish it . Well, in the dessert section, we took darshan. The darshan was good but the quantity  of vanilla scoop was poor -_-.. Well i give it 2/5 for food and for ambience &service  4/5

I visited this place on recommendation. The ambience is really good with a blend of old and new through its decor. Food, well, it's really good..save for a few shortcomings. This is the first place where I tried octopuses, and tbh it was amazing.. but the dishes they prepare with crab..arent that great because of the small size of the crabs..where all you find is a thick, hard shell. Even though it's Chinese...DO not expect a typical Chinese flavour that we get in most places in kolkata. It's different, and it's good that way

Went there for good sea food. But was utterly disappointed. Ordered Butter Garlic crabs (dry) but was served with gravy. Moreover, the crab was very dry and not juicy at all. When asked for manager/chef, the waiter said they had already left for the day and could not attend to my complain. Very bad experience.

This place is bliss and has done wonders for me whenever I wanted to order food on an urgent basis. I hosted a house party recently and had ordered food from here. I happened to order almost everything from the Continental section, starting from Grilled Fish, Grilled Chicken, to Fish Florentine and Tetrazzini.. Also ordered quite a few Chinese delicacies like Garlic Chicken, Chilly Chicken, Prawn in Chilly Coriander and Schweswan sauce, American Chopsuey, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Pan Fried Noodles, Chilly Lamb, Dry Chilly Chicken, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Veg Manchurian being some I could recall.. Everything was great, except for the Lamb which was a tad too chewy.. I frequently order food from this place, and they almost never dissapoint.

A quaint little restaurant in golf green. Classy interiors and tastefully done up. I loved everything about this place, the food, the staff, the ambience and the decor. the food is amazing with handsome portions and if you are as confused as I am about what to order, please ask for recommendations, they do that the best. On the manager's , Soumya's recommendation we ordered for garlic fish which was very good. Our order was a balance of chicken, fish and vegetarian fare and there wasn't any dish that we could complain about inspite of being critical foodies.
Apart from the food what we best liked about the place was the service and the staff,two critical things that makes a place worth a visit time and again. The service prompt and the staff extremely friendly and attentive. Overall the experience was worth every praise, a must visit!!!

Found one of the hidden gems in Kolkata. The restaurant is very difficult to locate because if you follow the google map then it would direct you to the other location. If you ask local people then only you can find it. That day i realized whatever technology comes it can never beat the help of local people. A House is turned into a restaurant. Pleasant and calm atmosphere. Yellow lights with the white shades of walls creates a fine atmosphere. We ordered cream of chicken soup, mixed fried rice, honey glazed chicken and vanila ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. The soup was served with garlic bread was heavenly tasted.. full of cream,butter and chicken. Soo yummm. Slightly disappointed with the honey glazed chicken. Wanted to revisit this place only because of that soup. Overall a good experience we had.

The Mango Tree is one of the finer additions in eateries to the Golf Garden area. The food though not out of this world, does not disappoint either. 

I and a group of my friends visited The Mango Tree around the month of November, 2015. The restaurant is spread over two storeys. The decor is Victorian inspired and friendly to the eye. I loved the entrance and also the choice in furniture. 

We settled into a more or less empty restaurant, with another table booked by a couple. What we were looking forward to, was the lobster, which sadly we were informed, was not available. We heard that the place had a good fare of sea food on offer and intended to try it. The missing lobster did dim our spirits much. As a result of this, we soon settled upon a fare share of dishes we found commonly intriguing.

1.    Noodles:

We ordered a plate each of Mixed Cantonese Noodles, Prawn Hakka Noodles and Chilli Garlic Noodles with Chicken. The Cantonese noodles were my favorite, amongst all the three variants. I like thick noodles, which was what I got. Happy there, though I intended to find a bit more flavor both in the Hakka and the chilli garlic noodles, yet good enough.

2.    Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Hot garlic Chicken & Chilli Fish:

Loved the baby corn. It shined in its crispy, tangy, spicy avatar and was loved by all. I have nothing extraordinary to say about the side dishes. They have the same run of the mill  flavors. 

3.    Chicken Tetrazzini:

A delight. Loved the Tetrazzini, could have completed the whole dish, but was harshly stopped by a friend. If I come back, this will be one of the reasons.  

4.    Grilled Fish with Herb and Caper Sauce:

The dish is decent. The grilled fish is tasty but would have liked it to be a bit more moist and juicy; the hot grill seemed to have done it a bit of an injustice. Yet, the accompanied rice and herb & caper sauce were impressive.

Over all The Mango Tree gets thumbs up from me. Hope we will get some good lobster, when we visit the next time.

I had to change the review completely not just based on the much better dining experience but mostly for the gesture shown by The Mango Tree.I rated them poorly because I had a bad experience of tasting overcooked octopus from this restaurant which I ordered through swiggy.The management asked me to email my residential address to them which I did.Today during the dinner time I was surprised with a complimentary panfried octopus and a chicken dish from The Mango Tree along with a letter wishing Subho Noboborsho.I was really very touched by this gesture.

Food was top notch this time.The octopus was crispy,crunchy yet not overcooked at all..tossed in a spicy tangy sauce.Just loved it.The chicken dish was quite nice too.

It was quite a pleasant surprise.Thanks a lot "The Mango Tree". Very few restaurants show such gestures to look after negative critique like this.Absolutely looking forward to a dining-in experience at this restaurant.And Subho Noboborsho to you people also. :)

Situated in Golf Gardens, this small and cosy place is truly a mesmerising hidden jem. Food quality is outstanding.Whatever I had ordered left me craving for more like Smoked Chicken,Squid Masala,etc.Price is also very reasonable, ambiance is excellent with very well maintained and clean interiors.Staff is also extremely courteous...but the food quality really sets this place apart.At this price this place probably offers the best cuisine I have ever tasted. Overall a must visit place and it should definitely be given a few visits!

The best thing about mango tree can be summed up as: lip-smacking dishes at really affordable prices. The place also has a very convenient location..about 5-7 minutes walk from tollygunje metro station. The place derives the name from the tree in front..which is lit up at night and looks enchanting. The decor is pleasing to the eyes..and the ambience very homely. The dishes..starting from the variety of soups..to the chicken starters, both their continental and seafood delicacies  left us craving for more. Their service is quite good and the bill was really easy on our pockets. We left,stuffed right up to our hearts. I would definitely recommend this place for not one..but many more visits.

Much contrary to the popular trend here, I am not going to rate this restaurant high. Have had a lot of high expectations, seeing the plethora of compliments people have showered in here for the praise of this restaurant. But alas, it was probably not my day!

This place was long in my pending list. Residing in a city, which is made as much popular by the existence of China Town as it is made by simple Bengali food, it would be probably a tough task to find out souls who do not prefer Chinese food. One day, gathering some determination, i made my way to the restaurant.

Coming here is pretty easy, even if you are not accustomed to the bylanes and streets of this city. Come to Jadavpur 8B Bus stand and take an auto which goes to Tollygunge (Remember there is a parallel line for auto going towards Ranikuthi). As soon as you finish completing traversing through the bylanes and hit a main road and a traffic signal, keep an eye for a complex to start being veiled by huge boundary walls. There should be a CCD just before this. Once the complex starts, and the auto takes a left turn by the complex walls, look to your right. The restaurant should be right there.

Once you enter in, you would see a narrow lane of passage (apparently not narrow enough) leading to the main door of the restaurant. The restaurant has been divided into two parts. I was asked to sit on the ground floor. The occupancy was almost nil and hardly one table was occupied by some foreigner group who were gorging upon their Chinese feast.

As soon as you start looking around, you would realise, the house being similar to one belonging to pre-independence era, with a kind of 'Bonedi-bari' looks! The ceiling above would be suggestive of the same. The walls around has been decorated beautifully with small racks where a couple of books are kept. The coloring of the wall matches beautifully with the reflection of the lights and produces a mixture of old looks with modernized ambiance.

The portion outside the main door also excels in decor. However, I found it a bit hard to deduce the concept. While on one hand, it may seem that tribal folks or people belonging to rural areas are enjoying themselves over a celebration by dancing, on the other hand some paintings also suggested of some war or fight going on!

Nevertheless, I quickly gorged upon the menu and decided to order for a Salt & Pepper Fried Seafood for dine-in along with a 500 ml. cold drinks and Mixed Noodles, Pan Fried Fish and Chef's Special Bang Bang Chicken for a take-away (There was an add-on here, which I would mention later).

The item served for dine-in was the first kick on the brick! While the menu clearly suggests it is a fried item, which implies the dish is gonna be freshly fried and then served, the item was rather cold and soggy. Not to mention, it lacked flavor and was without either pepper or salt. Clear indication of a pre-prepared dish reheated in the oven! 

Taking just one spoon made me realize what a farce of a dish I have been served. I quickly complained to the people managing the restaurant. To my surprise, they were not ready to accept that there was a fault with the dish and tried to insist that this is how the particular dish is served.

However, as they say, logic always prevails. They quietly succumbed down, not that it didn't display their lack of professionalism, but would have had made no point by keeping on arguing. I ordered for a replacement dish, Dry Chilli Chicken. This particular dish (which was served for DINE-IN) was the only decent one I got here). The chicken was slightly crispy and tossed well in Chilli Sauce with a splash of vinegar. Although it was a tad bit high on the sour content, I didn't mind much. To me, it was one of the best Dry Chilli Chicken I have had in ages. My content level was so high, that I ordered for an extra Dry Chilli Chicken to be packed for parcel.

It took some time for me to receive my order and I quietly paid my bill and took transportation back home. Coming to the take-away order:

Noodles:- Decent. Sufficient meat with ample veggies tossed in wok with Noodles.
Pan Fried Dish:- Decent as well. Although, the quantity of fish was slightly less. I would had loved it to be a bit flaky. The fish served was more of a stiff nature.
Bang Bang Chicken:- Slightly sweet and sour. Nothing special. This is a dish mostly made popular by another Chinese hotshot and whenever I come across this name, it makes me think of the quality I have had many years back while dining with them.

This particular dish served in TMT was more of a Teriyaki Chicken type. Failed to understand how this dish is a 'Chef's Special'.

Dry Chilli Chicken:- Preparation style almost same as served in dine-in, but this one had way more vinegar content than I had expected. 

Result:- Had to keep answering to nature's call throughout the entire night and the first part of the following day.

Am I impressed with them?  Really not! Unless I give precedence to their decor over food and professionalism!

Will I visit again? Probably yes! Hoping for the fact, that the food prepared would be fresh and not reheated!

One point for decor, and half a point for the decent dry chilli chicken I was served for dine-in!

The restaurant is made inside a house, so you get small rooms which happen to be the dining area here. However since the interiors are not bad, they add up as a good factor to this place. Food was average.

Very good place to try sea food.. Ordered chineese and in sea food we tried Octopus. Both were equally good.The ambience is a kind of little homely. Location of this resturant is a little tricky to find, do follow the map. Overall a good place.

This happens to be my first review but third visit to The Mango Tree. In my latest visit we were a big group of seven people and decided to happily go on an experimental spree with the dishes. In starters we ordered Konjee Crispy Chicken and Pan Fried Fish and we were all delighted with our choice. Our main course included Fish Florentine, Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Pasta of which by my personal choice I loved the Fish Florentine. Unlike the Fish Florentine I have had in one of the most famous continental restaurants in Kolkata, this Fish Florentine had a green top layering and was really yum. However, we had to end our meal with the tried and tested Hakka Mixed Noodles as the serving portion was not enough for our hunger. Sadly the last was not really the best as the prawn in the noodles were not to be trusted. However, we did not let that spoil our much planned dinner plan. 

If you are a hookah lover, this place has more surprise for you as a very tiny area on the top floor houses a flavored hookah joint Above-n-Beyond at a supremely reasonable price. 

The decor is very pretty that transports you to a pretty Portugal home in soothing white and well done walls with framed pictures and an antique big mirror. My suggestion for the place would be to better the Hookah joint in terms of service as surely they cannot do much about the space. Must try if you are going with your friends or even for a quite date. 

We did click a lot of pictures otherwise, but once the food arrived we could not be bothered. 

Must tries according to my three visits: Crispy Konjee Chicken, Pan Fried Fish, Fish Florentine, Bacon Wrapped Chicken

Had been there on a sunny Saturday with my friend for lunch. I must say the sea food lovers must try this place.It is not very easy to locate , it is situated in one of the bylanes of tollygunge. From outside it would look like a house with sitting areas outside. We went inside and we're directed to the 1st floor thigh the ground floor was almost empty .We were the first ones on the 1st floor. The ambience is peaceful with black and white pictures on the wall. The waiters are courteous enough to suggest the best sea food available that time. First we ordered cream of soup chicken, which was served with bread sticks. It was good in taste but nothing special .Then we ordered Crab masala which was spicy and tangy crab legs with dry masala. The crab was soft and the flesh was also soft so it was chewy. Then for main course we ordered mixed seafood rice and octopus masala. The rice was no doubt tasted yummy but the octopus was hard and elastic ,should have been softer. The amount is really too much for 2 persons. And special mention for the wide care of menu.

This is my current favourite place to hang out. I have visited a couple of times here with my boyfriend. The place has got a elegant look with beautiful paintings and mirrors. 
Now, let's come to the food. Though they serve a wide variety of foods, but every time I end up ordering bacon wrap chicken. I'm simply obsessed with this dish. The bacon is tenderly cooked and the chicken filling is so damn delicious. This dish is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED guys. Their house special steak is good but nothing overly inviting. However the chicken one tastes better. They also serve crepes which are quite appetizing. 
There's a hookah parlour at the top floor of the building. Outside seating is also available out there with a special finger food menu. So if you are planning to have a pocket friendly place for hanging out with few friends, this is a must visit !!

This place is located off Golf garden road. If you're traveling in public transport then the auto that takes you to tollygunje from jadavpur will easily drop you there. The decor is very nicely done with a spread of continental and chinese. And I must say that both the quality and the quantity is quite great!

This place is within a range of 300 meters from my house. Well I have tried The Mango Tree for the first time today, and the first thing that came to my mind is why did not I try this before. The Mango Tree is yet another place in Kolkata that serves great sea food. I had seafood noodles (amazing, both quality and quantity wise), fried seafood (a decent potpourri of squid, octopus, sea fish and prawns, spicy and cooked perfectly) and chilli fish (a moderately spicy fish cooked in a delicious gravy). Well, I was satisfied with The Mango Tree, I ordered online, and food was delivered within 20 minutes. Good Job guy!

Situated en route to Tollyguange Metro from Jadavpur, the Mango Tree is truly one of the best restaurants I have been to.
 It's actually a household which has been turned into a restaurant. The ambience is  cosy and elegant and the staff was very affable and courteous . It has an old fashioned anglo indian theme with various portraits hanging from the wall. 
Okay so now coming to the food. For the starters we had cream of chicken soup which had a white creamy texture and tasted fabulous. For the main course we ordered Fish Florentine along with roasted lamb. The fish was so tender and succulent and it's green cheesy gravy was to die for. The roasted lamb was delicious, well served with rice, broccoli and baby carrots. The vanilla ice@ cream with hot chocolate sauce was equally remarkable. The quantity of food was huge. The pocket pinch is average and most importantly you don't need to pay any tax. 

Overall it was indeed a wonderful experience and I would surely visit again.

I am pretty surprised,  how some of us could give rating 4 to this resturant.  It was our largest gastronomic blunder after indthalia.  The food was 
pathetically average, except for the chowmin which was inedible. Otherwise the ambience was nice for a gropie/selfie.

This is a fairly new place very near to Tollygunge Metro and I was pretty apprehensive about visiting The Mango Tree but my friend kind of insisted so we decided to give it a try and thank god we did because this is one of the coziest places I have been to. The decor is beautiful. We decided to start with the Oriental Sweet Corn Chicken Soup and ordered the Crispy Conzy Chicken for starters. The Crizpy Conzy was simply delicious and super crispy.Then we ordered Egg Fried Rice and Chef's Special Chicken (which was kind of ok not that great). We also had sweet lime soda and ice cream. I would again love to visit this place for its seafood and the Crizpy Conzy again :P

If you are looking for a cosy yet beautiful place to take your beloved for a dinner (preferably) or lunch while keeping in mind the budget, this is the place for you. Starting from the name, the place, the décor- everything about this place is beautiful. The owner has done a beautiful re-modelling of the house. White walls with nice, colourful paintings and mirrors, they have managed to give it a very pretty, elegant look.

Now, the real deal. The food we ordered were:

Roasted chilli Pork- small pieces with capsicum, onion & chilli. Most of the pieces were only the fat. It was a bit stiff, hard to cut, cold. Taste wise it was a bit salty but overall it was okay. Average. Not extraordinary.

Main course: Schezwan Chilli Fish & Egg Wrapped Chicken Fried Rice. Quantity wise it was good. But again failed to impress. Fish was smelling a bit odd, but it wasn't bad to taste. The rice was absolutely blunt. No Taste at al. The Schezwan sauce has marked it's taste on my tongue. It wasn't that fiery hot, wasn't blunt. Good with the rice.

Coming to other details: The service was prompt. Waiters were very nice and courteous. Helped us to decide the dishes. 

 A lot of improvement needs to be done to be in the game of food in the crowd of 'new found restaurants' almost everyday that too in Kolkata. 

They have continentals & sea food in their menu too. Will definitely try those out soon :)

Ordered in food from this place twice. Quick home delivery service. On both occasions I had ordered chicken tetrazzini and it was finger licking good! Alongside I had also ordered grilled chicken, mixed fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and chilli chicken. While the Chinese fare wasn't the best as per my preference, the Continental/Italian quite compensated. Having a restaurant which serves Continental/Italian, in this area, is in itself a blessing! 
Sadly, some of the items are slightly overpriced considering the quantity. No other complains at all! :)

I honestly love this place, it's a place I frequent for chilling out at their rooftop cafe with a hookah and food. 

The location is a little confusing for people who aren't too familiar with the place, but trust me it's worth the find. 

The decor is beautiful, they've transformed an apartment into a restaurant so there is a sense of homeliness as well.

Their food quality is excellent, seafood being their main attraction. The octopus dishes and their crispy vegetables in plum sauce are a real delight and would recommend it highly. 

Their hookah is good as well, the staff very friendly. 

All in all, the place is definitely a hidden gem

LOCATION : If one is not familiar with the Tollygunge area, the best way to reach "The Mango Tree" is get on the Tollygunge - 8B auto. The restaurant will be on the left hand side if you board the auto from Tollygunge.

DECOR : The first thing you notice when you enter "The Mango Tree" is the tree itself and the lights decorated around it giving the look of a garden in front of someone's bungalow. Inside, they have used paintings and mirrors to give it a homely feeling.

FOOD : We ordered Chicken Manchow Soup, Vegetarian Rice Noodles, Manchurian Prawn and Pina Colada, which totaled to around Rs 760.

SERVICE : Their service impressed us more than the food as they were very prompt in bringing our orders and clearing the tables for the next course.

EXPERIENCE : Overall, the experience was positive. And will be surely paying more visits here. :)

Zomato is making me lazy! I was trying to visit the mango tree for last few days, ultimately decided to order mangoes instead. Here are the mangoes:
Grilled fish with caper sauce
Garlic fish
Chilly chicken
Mixed fried rice
The packaging is good, can think of something more spillproof as the caper sauce and gravies turned out yo be little bit watery, especially the caper sauce which should have been creamy. Fried tick was best of the lot. Rest standard. Do I plan to order again? Not sure....

The Mango tree was an awesome discovery, stumbled upon it on Nearbuy, brought a Coupon for a 3 course meal for two. Ambience is really silent and calm. It is multistoried and the interior features are sharp.
For starters we had Manchow Chicken Soup and Drums of Heaven which were good. Then we had Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice and Chef's Speciality Chicken Bang Bang which was OK, but the fried rice was really yummm..
We finished off the meal with the standard vanilla scoop with chocolate sauce. Overall a nice place with a great bunch of polite staff members. The loop music was a mild mood spoiler which can be improved :)

As the name indicates, 'THE MANGO TREE' does have a mango tree. But don't worry, they will not serve food on or under the tree..., rather in a building just behind the tree.😃
 jokes apart..
Locating this restaurant is bit tricky. The simplest way is to find Bangur Hospital (if u r coming from Tollygunge) or to take an auto (jadavpur 8B to Tollygunge metro).

First thing that will catch your interest is their beautifully decorated exterior; hanging lanterns and beautiful art works. On entering, we were warmly greeted by the staffs. The interior decor is simple but elegant and peaceful. They have a vast menu comprising of oriental, continental and sea food delicacies. We ordered chicken Tetrazzini, sea food rice and devil's chicken. All the dishes came in huge quantity. Tetrazzini was very well prepared with lots of cheese, chicken and white sauce and was served with chilli garlic bread roll. Rice was aromatic, non-spicy and complemented the flavourful devil's chicken. Service was cordial.
Overall...
this restaurant deserves much praise in all aspects. I wish I could rate them 5.5. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

One of the most elegant décors you can find in a restaurant. That itself is a huge crowd puller! There's this gorgeous photowall thingy with paintings and a beautiful mirror that makes for some perfect clicks! The food is very delectable, served in classy white crockery. We had Manchow soup and Crispy Conzy Chicken, both are splendid! We had chicken fried rice and garlic chicken for main course and it was decent. Their prices are unbelievably cheap. I'd love to come back to try their seafood spread!

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Its always nice to be at dinner with your friend specially when he is a maestro in eating food. Tollygunj has variety of restos but this place looks very exotic with it different attire and location where it is. Been there with pre booked table and was expecting something really well after looking at the resto.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance looks very classy indeed. When you enter the main gate it looks so quite but when you enter inside you get a feeling of 1980s. Interior is really good and looks very sober. Lots of paintings displayed on the walls from ground floor to the stairs till the 1st floor. The decoration really impressed me. Staffs are really cooperative, well behaved. All thanks to Mr. Suman who took care of our meal very well.

FOOD: Menu was set and the orders were right away as follows:
Chicken Sweet corn soup, Chef's Special Bang Bang chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken in Devil's sauce followed by Kime soda and Vanilla ice cream with Chocolate sauce.

Chicken Sweet corn soup was very good. It was perfect when tasted hot. Thick and tasty. The chicken below the soup was a bit dissatisfaction.

Bang Bang Chicken was fine but way to ordinary to me. Didn't find anything special in it. Small 8 pieces of chicken with masala consisting onion, capsicum etc. It really didn't banged at all.

Chicken Fried Rice was good. Taste was nice. Looked beautiful and was a proper fried rice. But lil bit disappointed with the abesnt amount of chicken in the rice. Otherwise it was worth the price. 

Chicken in Devil's Sauce was a nice one. The pieces of chicken were huge one, gravy was thick and it had sour and salty feeling with chilly flavor in it, thou i found some hurdles breaking some pieces from between but dish's taste covered the other flaws. Contained 8 peices.

Fresh Lime soda was ok. Not upto the mark. Didn't done justice with the soda drink.

Whereas Vanilla ice with chocolate sauce was suprisingly well.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality was very very good. It looked they are very particular about their quality and maintains it with effort. Quantity is also satisfactory. Every dish can be easily divided into two. Prices are fine.

CONCLUSION: An effort with good foodalways pays off, if it don't then the other factors covers them up for you. But here we found the food as well as the service fullfilled our expectations to some extent. 

NOTE: the review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

We went for cream of chicken soup for starters. It was one of the best soups I had. Indeed heavenly it was. For the main course we had chicken and ham crepes and the fish florentine as suggested by our waiter. The food took a really long time to come but as they say you gotta wait for the best stuff. Absolutely meticulously cooked and it was a sheer delight having them. The best part is they do not charge you extra for tax. I would highly recommend this restaurant.

It was Christmas day and I wanted to find at a quiet yet well reviewed Eatery.The Mango tree caught my eye, not only because it was rated 3.8,but also due to its proximity to my home.I was also aware that it was located in a secluded corner of our neighbourhood,hence I decided to try it out for it was as good a time as any.The ambience was good since it offered a dimly lit quiet environment.The food quality was above average and played with our taste buds as far as Starters were concerned.The main course however was a little on the bland banal side.Quantity in both cases was superfluous. The only thing that bothered me out of my wits is the time they took to serve between items.It took uncomfortably a long time.They claimed to be understaffed and I noticed a single guy handling 4 tables all by himself. There was one more thing that struck me as Odd.They were inclined to deliver take away packages even at the cost of people actually waiting at the tables to eat then and there.Keeping all that in mind I would rate this place as moderate.

We had been planning to hit this place for quite sometime and finally decided to check it out. It's located a bit in the interiors of the lane just beside bangur hospital but is not at all hard to locate. The entrance showcases the sign board very prettily and has a very obvious mango tree right at the entrance. The walkway is decorated with miniature paintings that add a very cozy feel to the place. The interiors will impress. Adorned with pastel colors, mostly white, the restaurant is very subtle. It's got a very calm ambience to it and a light music is always playing in the background. The seating arrangements are fairly distanced and there is an extended area on the first floor too. The service is very warm, polite and fast. The man who was tending to our needs was very responsive and welcoming. The artworks hung across the rooms are really worth absorbing in. With brilliant brush and mix of colors, it gives a very classy touch to the place. The food is delicious. Very fresh and quickly served. We ordered drums of heaven for starters and had chicken rice noodles and chilli lamb for mains. And for dessert we settled with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. The portions served were really impressive at very reasonable prices. The overall experience with this place was heart warming. It was wonderful to be there and it is a must try for all.

This is one of the finest restaurants I have ever visited. The ambience was marvellous. Food were equally delicious. No two dishes are alike. I had visited it day before yesterday with my family, after the dinner I can easily say that Mango Tree will be at the top of my mind for any occasion not only due to their food and ambience, also for their hospitality. Specially Mr. Soumya Patitundi - the way he attended us, the way he suggested food, me and my family liked it very much.
I'm giving 5 for their hospitality.
4.9 for food and 4.8 for ambience.

The food arouses every taste bud. The presentation and unique taste of every dish is just amazing! No two dishes are alike. It was a gourmet delight visiting The Mango Tree- truly break free in every sense. Every now and then, you find yourself longing for food that is ‘different’, like I did on  last Saturday. After a spectacular dinner with my family, I can easily aver that The Mango Tree will pretty much top the list of places that can surprise you, pleasantly, with their out-of-the-box creations. Awesome sea food collection along with traditional Chinese in a non conventional way. Following are the dishes we tried :-

Starter
Smoked Chicken :- 8.5/10
Crispy Conzy Lamb :- 8.5/10
Prawn bacon wrap:- 10/10

 Main Course

Schezwan rice :- 7.5/10
Grilled fish with Herb and Caper sauce :- 8/10
Stir Fried Crab :- 9/10
Chili plum Lobster :- 9.5/10

Even reminiscing these names waters my mouth...Can't wait to visit again !!!!!!!!!!

How about one in Alipore please :):) ???

We just got out of here and I am reviewing this . This is to be the hottest property of tollygunj and also got its place in the hidden gems section of zomato . But is it really worth it ? Well this question is still unanswered from my side . The reason being we went there on a groupon offer and we did not taste their specialities . What we did taste is their oriental offering which in one word i will say good but the food that we had did not convince us to include this eatery in our hidden gem collection. We had the following items as listed in the groupon coupon : - 

Starters : -
1. Talumin noodle soup ( 3.5 / 5 )
2.Smoked chicken ( 3.5 / 5 )

Main course :-
1. Chicken fried rice ( 3.5 / 5 )
2. Chilli pork ( 3.5 / 5 )

Desert :-
1. Vanilla ice cream with choco sauce .

Coolers : -
1. Lime soda sweet 

The soup was good but not special . A very big dissapointed was the smoked chicken which seemed to be an exact replica of ( lat me kai chicken ) . The pieces were small but juicy and there was nothing smoky about it. The chicken fried rice was very very ordinary. The chilli pork was the saviour of the day as the meat was really well cooked but again the dish lacked salt and hence i did not give full marks . I would come back again to try their continental and seafood after that  I can fully judge their abilities but I will not recommend Chinese from this place . A special word should be given for the ambience because it is really worth eating there if you are looking for a proper ambience .The service was commendable and service time was good.

Saw a friend checking into this place and write a certain good thing, so was interested to check the place out. First of all, finding the place itself was a good task in itself. Entered the place and saw no one at the tables (except a man sitting with his face away from all into his cellphone and occasionally giving orders to the waiters; I presume he was a kind of boss or something), but still gave a benefit of doubt as it was the early hours of dinnertime (around 7:30 pm).

Talking about the service, the waiter was very much amateurish, though certainly not by age. Wanted to try octopus, but oh well, it can just get better (isn't it?) and so to my surprise(!) it was not there. So ordered the masala squid for starting things up and pork chop to follow it up. While giving order for the pork chop (which interestingly is not there among various others in the zomato menu at the time when I'm writing this) I specifically asked the meat to be from near the T-bone region and that I want it medium-rare. The waiter looked like I'm speaking Latin or Greek and just responded "It will be cooked as good as it is always done." I thought of asking "So what is this good you are talking about - is it rare, medium-rare, medium or well done?" but went for my better judgement to not ask it.

Well the food came after quite some time and I asked for the mains to come after the starters, but hey guests/customers are not that important, so obviously the two came at the same time to make one out of them cold even before starting. But still, all is forgiven if the food is somewhat okay. Those squids that were served - I think they have named it wrong. I  mean, it definitely looked like squid but was actually flavorless rubber loops in some masala. Oh btw, in between when I had to call that only one waiter who was there in the seemingly empty place, he actually didn't respond to the very much audible voice in the first time and when he had to, he asked me to wait while he was flipping through some pages, for which he took 2-3 mins. Coming back to the food, after my tryst with the rubber loops, I began with my cold pork chop. It was average, nothing to write home about; but the scarce vegetables that accompanied it was anything but flavorful crunchy pieces. Glad that I didn't order any drink and of course nobody in their sane mind would order any desert (the desert menu made me laugh) after such an amazing experience. The handwritten bill that came was similar to the style that can be found in local grocery shops. Thank God, they didn't ask for any comment or feedback.

I breathed with ease as soon as I came out only to be greeted by the cigarette smoke of the apparent boss just outside the gate.

This restro is situated between the auto route of tollygunge to 8b. Not so far from tollygunge though. I can say this outlet is best in tollygunge area. You can get best seafood, best continental here. All foods are amazing. And the place in very good also. I love this place.

Famished after a long morning meeting that continued a little over lunch time, finding this place in spite of GPS was a challenge in itself. Maybe the hunger pangs had taken away my ability to logic and think but, by the time I discovered this place, I could eat a horse! I had gone over its menu on Zomato while in delhi, over and over again and had created this fantasy play out of my entire order whenever I would go there :) Its only unfortunate that half of the actors to play out my food fantasy, right from Octopus to Crab were absent that day :(
Went with the next best I could find; House special Squid fry for starter and a Lamb Roast for the mains.
Now, how I understand, House special should be really well prepared close to the chef's heart kind of dish. What I got instead were over fried squids that i cud use as rubber bands to shoot the darn green peppers, all around, on other customers enjoying their meal :) Was so hungry that i chewed as many rubber bands as i could. I surely must have looked like a wannabe kid trying to chew 20 gums at the same time.
The Lamb roast however was a blessing in disguise. It was the only dish that saved their day for me. Succulent, melt in the mouth lamb morsels with that rich brown pepper sauce was heavenly in every bite. i didn't wanna waste any drop of it and although I am not a big fan of those Country Club type Dinner rolls that came along, I rubbed my plate completely clean, using them. 
I would like to give this place a benefit of doubt and will visit again to see if this experience overall, goes up or stays the same.

A bit difficult to locate if you are not familiar with the area. Take auto from Jadavpur 8b to Tollygunj metro, and this place will be on your right side once you cross the CCD near cemetery, or take the narrow Lane opposite Jogesh Chandra college (Kalabagan Lane),  beside a temple on your left and a masjid that is under construction on your right, keep walking to the end of the lane and this place will be on your right. 
It's extremely inviting from the moment the u stand in front of it. From the curved tree branch draped with yellow light string dangles the sign. The door is wood paneled and quite heavy. Very quaint in a u assuming kind of way. The interior was not at all what I expected!! Very very plush and extremely tastefully decorated. Furniture are done in white with the wallpaper and window treatment accentuating this white overlay. There are some fantastic old mirrors and colonial looking portraits, with a faux window towards the end wall. I didn't check out the upper floors and there's supposed to be two more. May be the next visit. 
I opted for takeaway despite being tempted to spend more time dining in. Order included chili pork, house special squid and a spaghetti carbonara with bacon. Bill came to about 820/- and they took around 15 mins to prepare and pack the food. The packaging was very nice with the pasta in a oblong square box instead of the regular round boxes. 
Chili pork was very good with nice chunky pieces of pork that was extremely satisfying g on the palate. Quantity was really generous with very less pork fat. The squid was a bit disappointing, although the sauce tasted good the squid itself were tough and had a batter coating on them that had gone soggy. May be the dish is more suited for dine in and not takeaway. Spaghetti carbonara was good with generous sprinkling of fat bacon strips.  The sauce was on the sweeter side and I added quite a bit of Tabasco to spice it up. Texture of the pasta was good and not gluggy. 
The place is very near to my home and I am looking forward to my next visit which I am hoping will be very soon.

A place which gives you a breathing space. A complete 3 storied place catering to different types of customers from youth for hookah on the top floor both AC and terrace offerings and 1st n 2nd floor for family dining. A different flavour it adds in the locality that needed some change in cuisine delicacies. Food was great though improvements in stuff management needed. Wish the management the very best for such an endeavour.

Now for the food....had ordered Tom yum soup which was very good....sea food Cantonese noodles which tasted nice....chili garlic crab which I personally did not like much coz it involved too much work breaking the shell nd eating d meat.....smoked prawn which was also yum.....

A very bad experience. Found spider in Pina colada (picture uploaded), and they served the starter after the main course. Ordered chicken bang bang, but the chicken pieces were hard & not at all fresh, took some effort to cut it. Quality of all the food items not up to the mark according to the high price.
Won't be visiting again.

This place serves awesome seafood..... Though the its bit tuff to locate this place but its worth a visits.... I have checked it at zomato and planned our launch for Nabami.....  the    ambiance was soothing.... White and silver decor looks classy..... We have ordered blue lagoon and fresh lime soda and smoked fish for starters... Every one visiting this place smoked fish is a must.... The mild aftertaste of lemongrass  will leave  ur palate amazed... For main course we ordered seafood fried rice and lamb in devil sauce.... Seafood fried rice  is combination of rice squid,prawn and small pieces of octopus seasoned well and taste awesome.... Lamb in devils sauce was pretty good.... And Vanilla ice cream with   hot chocolate was good... So if you planning a date or to hang out wid friend this place is strongly recommended.....

Not a big restaurant. Located away from the common din of the busy Tollygaunj area yet perfectly blends with the location
Lively decorated place with an amazing ambience and service
For starters we tried the smoked chicken and chicken wrapped in bacon which tasted amazing.
Shifting to main course we had mixed rice and lamb in devil's sauce which I personally recommend to everyone
For dessert the usual choice of Brownie with ice cream only one negativity in this aspect is that the brownies were extremely hard
Overall I must visit for all the food loving people residing in this city of joy

I had brought home the food. Had it reheated.  Taste was pretty good. Infact very good. Had the standard mixed fried rice along with Chili Pork....lovely.

Feeling nice to have found a new and good food joint near our locality.

Another good point .... I would give a lot of stars for it....the food does not or might have very less MSG. I have a little intolerance towards MSG. 

Don't know whether they have home delivery. In case they don't,  would suggest it they could start.

I visited the restaurant today with a lot of expectations after reading the reviews.  But I must say it didn't turn out to be that good. 
I ordered pan fried chilli fish, chicken fried rice and chilli coriander chicken. 
The fish was smelly, I am guessing it was andhra fish that they use so that was a downer. The rice lacked seasoning and the corriander chicken had no corriander flavour whatsoever. Just the colour. Disappointing.

perfect for quiet cosy dinners or takeaways, this place has a very relaxing ambience. I dined at the first floor and the food was beyond expectations. The seafood soup, mixed rice, pan fried octopus, chilli oyster lamb- everything was well prepared and delicious, but what stood out was the roasted chilli pork, it was excellent ! The best i have had so far. I wanted another portion but I was full and now I just want to go back again. The server was so attentive and warm, and the food not being overpriced  was totally worth the money.

We found this place due to its very good rating and proximity to our home. 
Initial impressions were good, staff was courteous and attentive...
With the plethora of Chinese places already existing in kolkata, we weren't expecting something outwards here. Nevertheless, the entree and soup was a bit different on the good side. 
We had mostly veg dishes for the main course, which again was close to perfect. My wife says that the smell of non-veg from dishes others were having we're too tempting ( she is a non-veg and I am a veggie) so we are definitely ordering up next time too. 
A must go if you have some time at hand and a small group for company. 
P.S. The only negative was that the veg starter smelled of seafood probably because it was cooked in the same pan as another dish.

Found it at zomato. lots of expectations we had.. and it fulfilled our expectation .

what a restaurant is was. Yah its little difficult to find out (for non south kolkatan people).  from tollygunge you just need to go golf garden lake KFC. it is situated near that kfc. 

combination of white & silver theme is great. lovely decor. and the food was yummy too.

we ordered  crispy conzy lamb as a starter

, chef's special bang bang chicken (side dish)

, hakka noodles (main dish) . i personally love noodles :D

Crispy conzy lamb was wowsome. 5/5 .

chef's bang bang chicken was decent 4.5/5

and hakka noodles was great 4.5/5

decor 5/5 

ambience 5/5

staffs are polite and helpfull. 

it has a hookah parlour just upstairs.

and the entrance was too good :) 

we just loved this place . .. .. ... .. .. . .. .. .. . . .. .

I had been wanting to visit this place for a long time as it's close to my home. So I went today with my friends and I must say it's one hidden gem! The location is tricky. It's near the golf garden CCD. The ambience is fantastic, staff is courteous and helpful and the food is amazing. We ordered smoked sea prawns, grilled chicken with coriander salsa and Italian pasta with prawn and brandy. The quantity was enough for two and prices are reasonable. Continental lovers should definitely try this place out.

We ordered 3 dishes which was delivered at our home on time. The presentation and food looked really good. But the whole meal was extremely disappointing. We ordered pasta in pink sauce which was loaded with chilli flakes. So much so that it was too spicy to be consumed. Ever heard of spicy Italian food?! The grilled chicken tasted alrite but the meat was overcooked and tough. We also ordered bacon wrapped chicken starter but what we received was chicken wrapped in large slices of ham! I called the restaurant back to give them this feedback but they didn't seem to care much. All in all a really bad experience.

Had a surprise birthday planned for my friend here a few days back. The coordinating and arriving took some time, and the staff were courteous and polite enough to help set up the cake and everything.
Coming to the decor, which is why we chose the place - it's beautifully and subtly decorated in brown and white tones, the walls adorned with classy mirrors and pretty paintings, and a wooden bench right outside gave it an overall nice look.
Food - All the items ordered were brilliant. Crispy Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn was good, but Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Veg Tetrazzini won our hearts. 
They played English songs from the 80s and 90s, which felt good for a change, as it took us through a walk down the memory lane. 
The bill made us happy too! Thanks to the happy hours on food here.
Definitely coming back again.

Take the golf garden road, to the right side of the CCD, this small cozy place is situated. We went there with family and got a warm welcome from the staff.
The draw back of the place is its small space. A residential has been turned into a restaurant.
The quality of food was okay type not too much satisfying, even the honey lemon chicken we ordered was over sweetened. The variety in desert is not provided here but it gives a family atmosphere to the customer.

Its located close to golf green CCD and the location gets easy to reach by taking an auto of route jadavpur 8b to tollygunj as the restaurant is located on its way. Firstly its a beautiful house turned into a restaurant. It has amazing decor and a pleasant ambience. The staffs are very well behaved though they we had to wait a lil long for our food. Lat mei kai and crispy caunzy chicken both tasted splendid as starters. In the main course we had chicken in Devil's sauce, it was good enough..bang bang chicken wasn't that great..Mandarine fish might turn out to be a fav for the fish lovers..chicken hakka noodles and mixed fried rice were good enough in taste and quantity..overall it has been a great experience to be there in a birthday treat with friends..the soft music and the entire first floor which was provided to us made it even better..the additional bonus I must mention was the added 20% off in happy hours..this was an absolute delight on the whole for college students like us as it is pocket friendly and a perfect food joint :)

My college friends gave their birthday treat here. It is located just through the lane beside the Bangur Hospital, Tollygunge! I liked the interior very much, it was clean and white with pictures and wall designs and the food was good too. We had lat me kai and crispy conzy chicken as starters. I personally liked lat me kai! Then in main course we had chicken hakka noodles, chicken rice with Chef's special bang bang chicken, chicken in devil's sauce, hot & garlic chicken and manchurian chicken. Overall it was a nice place for a get together birthday treat :)

On a fine evening, me along with my few friends went on to this place for a dinner. We had group-on vouchers with us.

The ambiance of this place was very good. Very well decorated and paintings were there all over the place. I was pleased by the artistic flavor of this place.

We were very excited to taste the sea food of this place. The dishes we ordered for sea food combo deal:

Beverage- Fresh Lime soda: It was refreshing.

Soup- House special mixed sea food soup: Not so thick but taste wise very good.

Starter- Panfried octopus: For me this dish was the showstopper. The best dish of that evening according to me. The taste of this preparation with perfect combination of herbs was very good.  5/5 for this dish.

Choice of noodles- Sea food green noodles: It was little heavy but was good.

Choice of rice- Cantonese sea food rice: This particular disappointed me a bit. I didn't liked the smell(smell of coconut oil) of this particular dish.

Side dish-Squid masala: Good.

Dessert- Vanilla with hot chocolate sauce: Good.

Overall experience of the evening was very good.

Yesterday I have been there with my family for dinner.  Available cuisines are Oriental, Continental, Chinese but we have tried oriental soup and steamed meat ball, continental main course, and desert. First of all the sweet corn oriental  soup was good. Then the steamed fish ball was awesome which was containing completely steamed fish without any bad fishy smell. In main course we had grill chicken served with rice which was a continental dish. The grilled chicken was just too good. But I didn't like the sauce served with the rice and grilled chicken. Then we had special sundae which is their house special, I think. And that dessert made the dinner beautiful. Seriously the special Sundae was just too good.

This is one hidden gem of a restaurant, in the literal sense of the phrase. Located at Kalabagan More, Golf Garden area, reaching this restaurant is a bit tricky if one isn't a local. If using public transport, one can get down at Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College stop on Prince Anwar Shah Road and take the Kalabagan lane to this restaurant. It is a short walking distance. Or one can take one of the autos that ply between Tollygunge and 8B bus stand and get down at Kalabagan More.

Now, coming to the restaurant. All the troubles that we had to face locating the place seemed totally worth it once we entered the place. The dominant colour is white and the restaurant is spread over two floors. In fact it looked like an entire building has been turned into a restaurant. The decor gave a calm feeling and the Pata paintings that hung on the wall gave the place a nice charm. The tables were a bit small but we did not mind that much. 

We ordered Cream of Mushroom soup, House Special Squid Fry and Smoked Chicken for starters. Which we followed with Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice, Grilled Chicken with Coriander Salsa and Lamb cooked in Oyster Sauce. The food was quite good and I especially liked the lamb preparation. Only did not like the Grilled Chicken with Coriander Salsa much. It tasted like plain coriander chutney and did not go well with chicken. The proportions they serve are generous and totally value for money. This is especially true for dessert 🍨.

Service took a bit of time, but we utilized the time taking selfies unashamedly as we had the entire floor to ourselves ! The staff who waited on us was very polite and helped us with the menu, suggesting when we could not decide.

Cleanliness: On the cleanliness meter this restaurant scores medium. While the place and washroom was big and clean enough, they did not have any paper towels for drying hands. A cloth towel hung near the wash basin but we did not want to use it.

Lovely little gem of a place, tucked away in golf gardens. With a European bistro feel and interesting array of food, this place is worth a visit. 
We tried their house special squid fry which was a bit on the rubbery side, the Chinese fare was good. The desserts came in generous portions which is always a good thing ;)

Most impressed with their staff - very courteous and extremely quick service. And they have a truly exhaustive menu with a wide range of oriental and continental cuisines.

A Cozy little place that I didn't know existed! Nicely appointed, with muted colors and art prints on the walls and smiling wait staff, one of who was very pleased when we appeared to be familiar with most items on their Menu and was cheeky enough to comment that most people don't know their Frittata from their Quiche!!!
Went there on a cloudy afternoon with my sisters and had a nice lunch of Garlic bread, Frittata & Tetrazzinni, 
Food & service were not too bad though I wish they had slightly larger tables! 
Loved their Pamelo Tree outside, laden with fruit!

I went there with my wife on a weekday for lunch and was very pleased with the service and the food. They have both Oriental and Continental along with options for sea food. The prices are decent and the quality of the food is nice. The portions are pretty big too. Keeping in mind the influx of new concept restaurants in town, this one surely scores high. The decor and the ambience s a touch of sophistication. Why you should visit the restaurant is the varity of offerings you get. Even the chef would cuatomize as per your choice. If you love continental you should guve it a try.

It was way above my expectations!! 
The Decor won my heart.....from the entrance to the lighting and the walls....terrific!!
The restaurant was tricky to locate though. One can just take the lane after MR Bangur Hospital, which leads to The Mango Tree on ur left.
We tried the Sea Food Red Rice along with the Chef's Special Bang Bang Chicken, which was amazing. Its definitely a must-try!
I had a rewarding experience overall. Hope this place gets its Bar License asap!! 😇😇

This was a lovely experience.  
Location is a bit tricky, I had to follow the gps while driving. 
Well decorated place. Three stories high. About 5-6 tables on each floor.
We had an entire floor to ourselves which was a bonus.  could choose our own songs.  
Now coming to the food. We tried bacon wrapped chicken. Which was really good. Well seasoned.  The garnishings and the sauce complemented the dish well..
Next we had The House special steak. It had pork, chicken, mutton sliced.  It was good but not great. Mashed potatoes should have been there. The dish was on the saltier side. Some bread or potatoes or onions could have been added to balance the flavor. I hope they add this in future.  The chicken seemed a bit dry though. 
Will certainly visit this place again to check out their seafood menu as we're too full to try any.

So it was just before the first pour of this season, We headed to the mango tree for trying octopus.. but somehow they were running out of it. Right from the entrance gate to pastel white shaded interior, their decor is eye soothing and staff is friendly too. So we ordered for 2 portions of Pork chops, a Chicken steak and Grilled fish with caper sauce with four cold drinks. Service was bit delayed but there was no complain with the food. The pork chops were neat succlucent and well done but the fat portion was on the higher side which i did not prefer. Chicken steak was shredded chicken tossed in bbq sauce.. i had no idea of a steak in such tiny pieces.. and it had no accompaniments like mashed potato or some grilled vegetables. The grilled fish was delicate and tasted nice. Overall its a decent experience at the mango tree.

I really don't get it. Saw the place before. Read reviews on zomato. Pathetic food. Service is great though. Food was horrible. Crab =curry, lamb =curry, chicken = like a random road side curry . what was that?!! It's like they didn't wanna cook anything nice and so threw up everything as CURRY!!! Squid = nothing like "Squid", more of a crispy baby corn FRY . Didn't expect this. No garnish, No presentation. Absolutely nothing. Don't go on reviews about it being very good and exceptional or something.

Went to this place a couple of weeks back and thought it is worth a review. After alot of deliberation my girl gang finally decided on this place. Had gone on a wednesday night. Ordered the house special Crispy Kalamaari for starters and for main course ordered Roast Pork Rib Chops, Fish Florentine and Herb & Parmesan Crust Fish. Crispy kalamaari  was crisped to perfection. First time tried squid and didnt regret it. Roast Pork Rib Chops was decent...could have been better. Fish Florentine and Herb & Parmesan Crust Fish was good. Though there is a lot of mixed reviews about the food. I personally loved it. Not a big pinch to the pocket. Will surely visit again (:

Location: It is located close to the Tollygunge cemetery. Get on an auto from Jadavpur thana, get down at a stop called "Mannar Khabar". Take the narrow lane on the left and walk straight till you reach a pretty wide crossing. The restaurant will be to your right.  

Ambience: The first floor was closed, so we sat downstairs. Not as lovely as it looks in pictures, but cute and bright. The lighting is really photogenic. The ground floor is small, with only 5 or 6 tables. 

Food: We had a Groupon voucher. For non veg oriental meal with lamb and prawn. We took the following dishes:
1. Prawn tomyum soup - thin, sour soup with lots of prawns. It tasted really nice and fragrant. The flavour of kaffir lime was quite strong. My favourite dish of the evening.
2. Stir fried crab - crispy crab claws, cooked in a typical Chinese way: soy sauce, onions, capsicum, chilli.  Tasted good, but preparation was nothing special. 
3. Burnt ginger fried rice - good quality rice but absolutely no ginger flavour, burnt or otherwise. Too much of whole veggies for my liking. I felt like I was having home made fried rice, while munching on carrots like bugs bunny. Not very nice.
4. Lamb in devils sauce - Lamb was cooked okay, and immersed in a tomato gravy. There were 6 slices of lamb but the gravy was just cooked tomato puree. Not nice at all.
5. Mixed Cantonese noodles - Noodles looked like Maggi and was not cooked at all. Very rubbery. It wasn't fried like Cantonese is meant to be, and just immersed in a white gravy. The gravy looked and tasted like white mud. Whole, unfired, par - boiled veggies floating in it. It was completely inedible. I left most of it on the plate.
6. Darsan with vanilla ice cream - a tiny little  portion. Darsan was a bit oily, but after the disastrous main course, it tasted okay.

Service: Waiters are helpful, but not enthusiastic or friendly. It was plain that we were dissatisfied with our meal, yet no one responded. Don't expect service with a smile. They are there to do their jobs, and just that. 

Value for money: Even with a Groupon that cost Rs 500, we felt completely cheated. I wouldn't pay 200 bucks for this standard of food.

Bottom line: DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE! especially if you have a groupon. Who knows, maybe they treat their regular customers better, but we couldn't leave the place fast enough.

It's a really pretty restaurant. From outside it would seem like a household, because a whole house has been turned into a restaurant. The place is quaint with elegant furniture and theme of white and silver is something very soothing and fine. The paintings hung allover the house is really nice and the three mirrors give you some really exciting selfie points. Now comes the most important thing, the food. It's good, really good. We had ordered house special seafood soup, cheesy roastie and pan fried octopus for starters. Each one of them tasted excellent. I have found the soup to be a little stinky because I don't like pak choy, but those who like it, I think they will be fine with it. For main course we had taken mixed chilli garlic noodles and hunan prawn. They were above the expected standard. Darsaan with ice cream and lime sodas we had at the end. They were great but there was a little over usage of honey in the darsaan. Food is overall impressive. But one thing I have to complain about that the service time is really poor. They take a long time to serve the food. Otherwise it's good for a nice romantic dinner. Happy Dining! :)

If Zomato would allow me to rate the place below 1, then I would have. 4 of is for lunch, it took an empty restaurant with only one other table occupied, almost 45 minutes for the food to be delivered. The wait would have worth while if the food was good, any ordinary home cook would have made it better than this. I would not recommend the place nor would I come back a second time.

It tasted filthy and I couldn't have more than 2-3 morsels.The hot garlic chicken was okayish.My overall experience was bad.I am never going back again.

My sister took me to dinner here at my recommendation.And how I regretted it! We ordered chicken sweetcorn soup; roast lamb (which they say is their signature dish) and fish Florentine. The soup was good. The mutton roast was just mangshor jhol …… It did not have the slivers of meat that is cut from a large roast but hand-cut pieces from the butcher. The gravy was almost black with lots of chillies and sugar. There was no hint of mint which is an essential combo with mutton.The accompaniment of veggies were done well…. but the main thing was just not what it was supposed to be. The fish Florentine was only some spinach and cheese. We really had to fish for the fish in the dish. I would request the cook to pls look up sue authentic roast recipes and change this. 
The place was clean and service polite. But because the food is the main thing I am sorely disappointed

This newly opened place near CCD Golfgarden offers you something like a “quasi” fine dining experience … as it is almost there but not quite there !  While their classy white /grey interiors impress you and their elaborate menu soar up your expectations , the very average looking and tasting  food and a group of “not-so –well trained “ staff douse your hopes leaving you with a confused average aftertaste as you leave ! I would say that the prices are not justifies for the quality and there is ample space for improvement .

Intro : This place is located at golf club road, near to the CCD, but, difficult to figure out. An entire building has been converted to a restaurant. Pretty inviting entrance. Good decor, what I liked is prominent use of the color white and silver as a theme, even the dinner tables and chairs reflected this theme. I felt " it's "different" echoing in the decor.
Order :
Fresh lime - Usual stuff
Manchow Soup - pretty nice, 3.5/5
Drums of Heaven - Really liked it, they were crispy and nice 4/5
Chicken Cantonese Noodles - Very good, liked it, the gravy tasted nice, 3.5/5
Fish in Devils Sauce - the quantity of fish used in each piece was good , the gravy though had a bit of excess salt, was annoying, this really pulled down the preparation. 2.5/5
Dessert - Vanilla Ice cream in hot chocolate sauce - Usual
Service : Good service, courteous staff, just that they were in a bit of hurry to take the order, just after handing over the menu 3.5/5
Overall -  Good , but nothing out of the box in terms of food and service 3.5/5

Mango tree  should  definitely  be one of  your  options, when planning your next dinner date without  the  extreme  pocket  pinch. It's perfect when  you are in the mood for continental with an added choice of really good sea food. The ambience exudes a very homely old school feel, with a fireplace and everything! 
For starters, we ordered squid masala and pan-fried octopus and as main course, roast pork ribs. The squid masala harmoniously blended with its ingredients to form a really great tasting dish while the octopus was more on the spicy side. The pork ribs is a must try. It was very tender, with a perfect balance between the fat and the meat; it was accompanied by boiled vegetables and a bread roll. 
Service was really good, would definitely visit again.

Just returned from The Mango Tree without having a morsel of food due to Despicable service, deplorable behaviour of the staff,who lied on our face telling us that they serve fish items only either in starter or main course, whereas nothing as such was mentioned on the Groupon menu. When we tried to clarify with the manager, he blatantly affirmed the same, mainly because it was costly for them to provide fish both as a starter and as a main course. This was unacceptable by us, as we had prior reservations at the restaurant, and during the call, there was no mention of fish being there in only starter. This is a service failure both on the part of Groupon and the merchant. I will take it forward and say that The Mango Tree is a cheat and a fraud and has no hopes of making it big as a restaurant. They even tried to interrupt our call with the Groupon customer care by playing loud music and serving our soup while we were still speaking to the customer care. Very arrogant waiters. Please blacklist this hellhole before it commits more frauds and dupes more people. Thank you.

A much awaited visit to the well known 'The Mango Tree' turned out to be an average experience.
It was around 5:30pm in the evening when we hunted this place down. The place isn't very difficult to locate...the residents there were very kind enough to lead us to this place when we asked around a bit. At around 6pm we reached the place.
The place doesn't look very extraordinary as is depicted in the pictures here...but definitely the art in the walls outside was impressive. The walls around the entrance were totally filled up with tribal drawings...a small bench is kept very close to a tree outside for small time relaxations. We roamed around a bit and finally entered.
The whole restaurant is spread around 3 floors...though i don't know if the 2nd floor is available for dining or not. We didn't get much time to browse through the ground floor as we were readily escorted to the 1st floor...the ground floor seemed a bit compact,congested and dense. The tables and chairs were placed irregularly. But the furniture definitely was very likeable...the yellow and brown coloured chairs matched perfectly with the soothing white colours of the walls.
On the way to the 1st floor while climbing up the stairs we noticed a mirror placed in the front wall. Similar mirror was placed even on the way to the 2nd floor. A statue complimented the total scenario.
The room in the 2nd floor was more tidy and open than the first floor. The sketches hanged on the walls gave a neat look to the peaceful white colour on the walls. As we reached there in the afternoon the restaurant was more or less empty. So we had our choices of seats to pick.
After seating comfortably we decided to proceed with our order. We rummaged through the menu card and then picked our choices...we ordered chicken tom yum soup and smoked fish for starters. Both the items were perfectly made though the fish seemed a little too "smoky" for me. The fish was fried too much therefore it seemed a little crunchy and less fleshy to me.
For main course we opted for 1 burnt chilli garlic chicken fried rice,1 cantonese style chicken noodles and 1 chef's special bang bang chicken. The rice was perfect and really lived upto my expectation..though the noodles wasn't that impressive. The chef's special chicken yielded us 6 pieces diced meat tossed in the perfect sauce and it actually helped me gulp down the noodles which by then became a little difficult for us to finish off due to the below average taste.
The desserts namely darsan with ice cream and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce followed the way. Both were well made with enough darsan and chocolate sauce in both. 2 lime cordials were the perfect endings.
The food was quite enchanting but there are definitely reasons for me to deduct 1.5 from this place...the reason being the staff. The staff here from the very beginning seemed least interested to serve us and the last thing i would expect from here is that they sometimes even got irritated when we tried to learn a bit or so about their special items. They weren't even thorough with the menu and the unsatisfactory and substandard behaviour complemented their low effort in attending customers. An immediate action from the manager would surely bring more goodwill to this place.
Overall i had a really nice time in this seemingly house-turned-restaurant and would love to try some of their continental dishes next time.:-)

Location a bit off the grid, few minutes walk from Bangur hospital,  but food and ambience, simply great! We went there on a Groupon menu of seafood spread and it was totally worth it. The crab starters,  House special soup ,  octopus and shrimp in red sauce, seafood noodles ,  the red and green rice and the ice cream with Darsaan left us all burpy and starry eyed at the same time . I d totally recommend this place!

I have been visiting this place regularly at least once a fortnight with friends or family . The place never disappoints as the food is great and extremely tasty . Each dish I would say has it's own unique flavour and leaves you wanting more .... The starters and the main course both in veg or non veg are tasty .. The lamb , sea food and chicken dishes are finger licking good ... 
The only draw back I think is the stuffy atmosphere as it's too claustrophobic for my liking .

The location is a bit on the insides but still a good search cannot make this one particularly difficult to locate. Well what's a GPS for, huh?
Anyways it's actually the entrepreneur's home that has been refurbished into a two storeyed restaurant. Well the decor is simple yet classy and the place has a feel good factor to its customers with a penchant for restaurants that are well lit and decorated. As you enter the place the front lawn would fill your hearts with a strong desire of having that wooden bench outside your home too! *i wish*  The first floor is a big space with quite a number of tables but we being a noisy and adda-baaj crowd moved up to the cosier second floor.  The staff is courteous and halpful and actually put forward an amazing amount of suggestions. We took the help of the person who served us to order and we were amazed at his taste. The food was too filling and a pack of five couldn't help but stuff themselves with the five continental dishes ordered, even after mutual sharing. In our defense, we had a nice fill of starters. The starters were fish fingers and chicken drumsticks which were pretty good,but didn't match the main course. Hence the .5 deduction.
Well, coming to the main course... All of us had pure continental..
 I ordered a roast pork rib chops dish which was undoubtedly one of the best pork dishes I've tried in Kolkata. 
The other dishes tried were:
 chicken tetrazzini (an absolute dish made in heaven)
Grilled fish with herb and caper sauce and Parmesan crust ( my second favorite one after the pork)
The fish florentine (equally good)
The chicken steak (yummy, my best friend ate this so I got a lot out of this one)
Thus our main course ended and we neede a bit of fizz and ordered fresh lime sodas that was made very much according to our tastes. Usually it's a little bit too sweet or salt and lacks balance.
Then, as if we hadn't stuffed ourselves already, we ordered a plate of Darsan.
And in the end, we were wheezing and huffing and puffing.
The only funny part... Couple'a spelling mistakes in the menu card. It's steak, not 'stake'!! :D
Overall, highly recommended.

P.s. the silver lining?? No tax. Coz it's brand new and the two year period ain't over yet. So the pocket pinch is kinda lesser. Hurry!

A zomato regular, I run as many filtered searches as possible so that I don't miss out on any new place that may have come up! The Mango Tree fell into my list out of an area filter search.
If you know the CCD outlet next to the Tollygunge cemetery, this place shouldn't be difficult to locate. It is right at the turning.
The cuisine comprises Chinese and Continental. My yearning for continental food of my choice made me order a dish from that section. The descriptions hinted at something else but cheese baked! However that is what arrived, food oozing cheese from every pore, just what I don't like :| We had ordered for a prawn and a fish, both of which tasted almost the same. I must mention that the portions are good enough and so is the quality of the seafood. However, I expected some difference with other places and that these guys at least would know that continental doesn't mean only 'cheese'. The reason i expected this was the great reviews i've heard and read about Ecstasea, of which this place happens to be a twin.
If i subtract the 'excessive cheese' aspect then the food doesn't taste too bad. And if you are a person who loves cheese then this place is a good option. We wanted to try out something from the oriental section so we had also ordered for an assorted fried seafood platter. It was usual, like a dry chilli fish/prawn.
A meal for two with one starter would range somewhere around 900-1000 bucks.
If you're carrying your own vehicle, you may have to hunt for a parking space.

The food,especially the main course was not up to the mark. The service was way way too slow. It took almost forever to serve main course. The only highlight is the location and the interior designs...else not to mention.

After reading the rave reviews, we came from across the city to have a meal at The Mango Tree. No part of our experience justified the effort. The service was terrible, they didn't serve us water two mins before the meal came and the meal came an hour later. 

Most of the items on the menu were unavailable and what was unavailable was uninspired and nothing to write home about.

Couldn't even think of anything less than 5 while rating. 
We went with a groupon coupon, and the food they provided in that offer, was way better than we were expecting.

Location and Transport: A few minutes of walk from Bangur Hospital. Take an auto towards Jadavpur from Tollygunge metro, it will take you to the restaurant directly.

Ambiance: There is a retro feeling once you enter the restaurant. They have well-decorated outdoor seating (for waiting I guess) facility as well. This air-conditioned place plays soothing music while dining. Interior is beautifully decorated with different kind of art-pieces.

Service: Courteous staff, and prompt service. They provide good suggestions when asked about the menu. This is a main reason behind this rating.

Food: Coming to the main part, we just loved the food, every bit of it. Though we went with a coupon, we also ordered Chicken Cheese Roastie from the menu which we thought is priced reasonably. 
We had Chicken Coriander Chili Soup, Smoked Chicken, Chicken oriental Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Devil's Own Chicken preparation, Darsaan in dessert with complimentary fresh lime soda. As I already mentioned before, no complaint about anything except the lime soda- it could have been sweetened more.

Highly recommended.
I am definitely going again to check out some other dishes.

Mango tree is a joint that had been located by me long back when I was travelling from jadavpur to tollygunje in am auto. It is situated in the golf green gardens in between bangur hospital and the ccd out there. Mango tree has a tree outside and  beautiful tribal art done on the walls on the passage of the entrance of mango tree, further enhancea the beauty. Beautiful paintings on a white background is what characterises mango tree. We went in to redeem our groupon coupon . We had opted for the sea food combo. So the fresh lime water just came in at the right time. But I believe it could have been a bit more sweet. Then of course came in the soup. We ordered for the house special sea food soup. And it tasted amazing with generous amout of seafood that we went om hogging for quite sometime.  Then we decided on crab as our starters. Chilli garlic crab is what we did order for. It was amazing with he right amout.of garlic and chilli. What I do believe is the crab shell could be removed and the crab meat would only be used. Then came im the main course. Went in for mixed seafood green rice and squid In red curry. The squid was kind of disappointment.  But the green rice was amazing .with never endimg seafood.  Amd.we were filled till the stomach, when at last the dessert atrived. We wanted darsaan. I beliebve it is one of the good darsaans that I have ever tasted. Overall a good experience and quite easy on the pocket. Amust try for all.

Visited this establishment with fellow zoman @Petal. with a lot of excitement but oh well...
Tucked away in a very narrow road, parking will be one hell of a tough job. Rather impossible to be true. As you walk in you can't help but notice the effort they have put in to give you a posh fell with the decor. Good effort, but I could smell paint and fumes which was extremely discomforting specially with the windows closed and an ac that stops working from time to time. The service is efficient and quick. The food however is not at all up to the mark. The noodles they served was no better then the ones u can get at an above then average kiosk. I would have preffered China over plastic utensils that they serve you in. The calamari(squid) had a stench about them due to some ingredient they used I belive and the curry was "alright" same for the octopus. Maybe a few years from now we will visit you again and maybe you will surprise us.

This place is just amazing! Its in one corner of Tollygunge and you have to really search for it! But it is sooooo worth the effort!! It has a well decorated mango tree at the entrance! We had a very good waiter- Mainik, who helped us with suggestions and man were they good!! We started with pan fried octopus which was exquisite! Then came the Roast pork rib chop which was cooked to perfection!! But last but not the least, we ordered the bacon wrapped prawns!! This is nothing like you have ever tasted!! Once you take one bite of this you will literally forget who is with you and just concentrate on eating  that precious dish!! It is the best meal that I have ever had in my life!! Hats off to the chef- James Richard, you have magic in your hands!!

Mango tree located between golf green and tollygunge connector was the place we landed up yesterday evening. We got tables on the ground floor as we were told there is some party going on upstairs. They told us to go for continental as it was their speciality. We ordered Roasted pork rib chops, fish florentine, grilled fish and vanilla icecream. The food turned out to be quite satisfying. Each of them had generous servings, and tasted quite delicious. The price is quite reasonable as our order cost us around 1000bucks. Pork rib chops is their signature dish, so try it out..

P.S. Though the name said Mango Tree- Food  drinks and lounge, we were wondering what the latter two actually meant..!!

So we would always walk past this place, and try to peer inside like a couple of curious children. The people inside would tell us that they would open shortly, and mollified, we would walk on, telling ourselves that we have to come here, we just have to. And then they opened, and there we were, on the very first day itself. Let's just say the insides did not disappoint. 

It is a very beautiful place, it is. They have these beautiful prints on the wall, including my personal favourite, a van Gogh self portrait. Also, they have this rack of awesome books, including one on Jewish legend and another on Scandinavian mythology. That would have been enough for me. And then they add to the magic by serving delicious food.

Their Roast Rib Pork Chop is just out of this world. The pork is beautifully spiced and roasted to perfection, and the accompanying vegetables are succulent and add to the flavour. We also had the chilli pork sausage which were delicious, but very spicy. A bit of a complaint here, we ordered the octopus in teriyaki sauce. The octopus had an off-putting smell, so we sent it back, but they were willing to replace it. So that's good.

A very good place. Will be returning soon.

Food is good but service is astonishingly slow. We had ordered Oriental and ideally oriental items do not have a long preparation time. Also the menu in Zomato shows Squid & Octopus but in reality we were given a different menu where these did not feature. May be Zomato needs to update the menu.

we had  a very different tasting tangy seafood soup,followed by a crispy chicken starter.the seafood cantonese noodles was perfect,the chcken tetrazzini had the perfect cheese and consisitency.the chicken steak could have been better.a must try -a restaurant with a difference.

Experience the Exotic in Fine Dining...As much fun and unique as the name of this food shack suggests- Its ambiance, food spread and quality of fine Dining experience - truly surpasses  competition- especially in the southern fringes of the city where such a delectable palette of Oriental, Mediterranean and Continental is hard to come by. As you step into the very English- pristine- white and gold decor of the eatery - you are absolutely to be wooed by its "wow" interior ( savoring delicacies amidst Van Gogh's impressionistic art). With chunks of the Globe on your platter in its sprawling spread of starters to the "main" course and the "tale" enders :) (which are equally slurp) - this newby food joint is absolutely a 'fun' yet 'fine' dining destination which makes no holes in your pocket. P.S. - I Loved the range of Sea Food they serve - A must TryThe only fret being the tendency of you turning into an absolute addict of such sumptuous food.The Mango Tree...is the place to be :)

"menu please!! there is no point being on zomato if the menu is not showcased. zomato is not just about good reviews -  it is a food guide and yes i'd like to know the details before going in blindly..."
Okay.. that was my previous review  and comments on seeing shut door before zomato updated  'monday closed' information ...before actually visiting the place. We finally landed there last week and it was surely a joyous evening. A brand new place with nice decor, innovative menu .. me pleased. Our order was the house special salt and pepper fried seafood and cheesy roastie with ham and bacon. The latter delighted us with the flavours and execution. i surely have the impression that other dishes will be equally good and i will be back to try them. Price and quantity at par with other restaurants, however, a little more quantity would be much appreciated in the long run.
few points i deducted for the non-availability of the dessert, especially the fondane. A little more thoughts into the ambiance ( music played etc. ) would be great for the fine dining that is being showcased.
Congratulations to the owners for putting up this venture successfully.
