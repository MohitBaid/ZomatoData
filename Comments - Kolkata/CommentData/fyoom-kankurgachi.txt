The only place with low music and perfect lighting..good food reasonable price drinks and courteous staff .. the decor is very good. Let you smoke anywhere you want to. The board games are a plus point.

Below 1 Rating on the basis of wrong rate chart updated in here, also here rate update low as per pint (350) option in beer instead of bottle (650) ml. Ambiance is good and friendly.

More over our experience is very badðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«

The ambience of this place is amazing and the service is also great. But I think the food can be upgraded several notches up. 
I hope the concerned authorities totake note.
But I would definitely visit the place again!

This place is shit. They show stupid decorum. Which is pretty useless. A waiter out there behaved outrageously and which is utterly disgusting. They claim to have a dress code and they act weirdly posh.  However, they don't even understand what it actually means in practice. Not recommended at all because of their mean and cheap showcase and false egoistic attitude.

A separate section in the Go Green restaurant, this is an all veg cafe which serves alcohol. Nothing great about it, a bit over priced and the worst part is they allow smoking in the entire cafe area and not in a separate smoking section which is a mood spoiler. Service is good, the drinks are served quickly but the cigarettes kill the mood.

Food quality is good. Positive thing is this is a smoking zone. Service is also good. This is a good place for drinking. Everything is good but this is totally vegetable zone.

Fyoom is located in a room behind Go Green. It's quite small in size. The food is decent. There are some games to play including Foosball. 

The only negative about this place is that they allow smoking inside the common area. This made me really uncomfortable since I can't tolerate the smoke.

The staff on the other hand is nice and quite talkative. In short if you are comfortable with smoke, then do pay a visit. 

Order Highlights:

Kurkure Chana Fry

Sizzling Chinese Platter
