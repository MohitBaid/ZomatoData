Zomato why you don't have -ve rating???
This place worst than desi bar.
If you don't oppose they will literary allow people to seat on your lap . They capacity of around 50 and allow around 200 people 
You will get hot beer and cold food here. Staffs are rude and unprofessional .
Ruined my new year eve by visiting this place .

Great ambience and music to keep you in a good mood.
However, the menu is on a pricey side as well as many items are not available.
Their crispy chilly babycorn is very tasty.

The ambience was just okay! 
The crowd wasn't the best! 
Food was a bit over priced and more importantly not worth the money. The chicken they served were overfried. 
The shisha was smooth! 
The waiters weren't professional and didn't pay any heed. 
Just an okayish place to visit in CC2 if you have no other preferences.

Went there after Christmas. Ambience was good but hookah made this place little suffocating.
They have two different sitting arrangements. One is restaurant another one is lounge. We sat on the lounge area. They charged 7000 rupees for 4 people for only sit in the lounge. Food and drinks charged separately. They gave us two separate  bills, one printed bill for food another hand written bill for lounge charges. I don't know what's wrong with them but I never found any lounge who charges only for sitting in the lounge. Even pub has some complementary drinks or food for the entry-fee. At least you should tell the people beforehand. Food was good but didn't make any sense in front the high cover price.

There's a huge scope and I mean a huge scope for improvement. We visited this lounge when on the lookout for a good Sports bar. I know there were some obvious better places to go to but we were in the area and had a match to catch. Thus, Blue Nile. On entry we found that the match was on already. So we grabbed the only available couch. Now things were fine till we were seated. Being a Sports lounge, I think all the couches should have had a vantage point with the TV if you get my point. Our couch sadly did not. Moreover there were people with hookah which made it a little stuffy. Blue Nile could have done with some nifty air circulation thing considering the decent carpet area (just a suggestion). The service was pleasant. But then again, there was no beer other than Tuborg available. I mean I am fine with Tuborg but hey, it's a Sports Lounge isn't it! Should it not be all about beer? Or am I weird? The food was decent (read average). We ordered some chicken starters. And then ended winding up as soon as the match got over. Oh by the by, I think they should have done something about the music too. Random jukebox doesn't help when you're a theme lounge. Maybe I am being a little too harsh but I have been to places in Delhi and Mumbai which are uber cool and find no reason for Kolkata to not be  able to match up in the medium budget lounge field.

I went here as there is hardly any restaurant option in this mall. The fare carries the usual Chinese, North India, and Continental fare, ai thwre's nothing different here. I was expecting something more Egyptian, Middle Eastern, or North African in the menu, as the restaurant name implies, but there's none of that.

The seats are way too low--or the tables too high--making it difficult to properly eat with plates and cutlery.

The seating arrangement is stuck in the corner due to which calling for service becomes very difficult as people cant see you in the dark and nor can hear you in loud music. You have to wait for the waiter for a log time till he shows up. Food quality is decent however service is very slow. Need to do some work.

This lounge was unknown to me till yesterday, finally found it and visited. Loved the rocking ambience. Open hookah place availability is there. You can visit the place for rocking ambience with your love one. Nice ambience will be available for couple also. Foods are good, nice sizzler and platter combination are available. If you love the rocking ambience and high song..Just visit with the special one ...Just share the moments and food. Lovable place in a popular place like city centre 2,Newton. Best of luck to the authority of blue Nile lounge.

Worst quality of people goes there. Went to the pub yesterday and asked them for a smoking room and they directed us to the lounge smoking room where already 12-15 people were there(all underage, some of them were like 12-13) smoking joints and cursing like anything. We could barely see anything. Thanks to the smoking room we couldn't even finish the fag and left the lounge with a severe headache.

I have been here 3-4 times while my stay in Kolkata. Once with my parents and other time with my friends. I celebrated my Birthday once in this place. They would play the birthday song for you ❤ 

Okay. Back to the food. It's a nice place to be. The atmosphere is great with nice people serving the dish. The food here is delicious, a bit pricey but perfect. The drinks here are good too.

I need to search my memories and find the pics. Will upload them soon.
