চাঁদনী চকের একদম রাস্তার ওপরেই । পরিবেশ তেমন ভালো নয় । খাবার এর মান এবং স্বাদ দুটোই মাঝারি । তারা তারি খেয়ে বেরতে চাইলে আদর্শ  । চিকেন রোল খেয়েছিলাম , মোটা মুটি লেগেছে ।

A street side fast food centre located at Chandni Chowk, Kolkata.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chicken chow , which was well cooked with nice fillings and was tasty.

Pocket pinch is low.

This roadside food joint is located at Chandni Chowk , Kolkata.

Zero ambience but quick service.



Tried Egg Chicken Roll, which was tasty with good stuffings and was well prepared.

Pocket pinch is low.

Liked their Egg Chicken Roll very much. Food is cheap and quality is fine. Their paratha was also very good. They also make Chowmine here. I have tasted it, although very cheap the quality of Chow wasn't good atall.

Newly opened joint. Went for Double Chicken Roll and Chicken Moghlai Paratha. Loved the food items made and prepared well. I hope they keep up with the same tempo.
Best for takeaway.
