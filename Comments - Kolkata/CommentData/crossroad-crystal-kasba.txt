Loved the food here, we ordered continental mostly. The lamb pieces were tender and juicy, quantity was good, can be shared, staffs and manager were extremely courteous. However, we didnt like the paan ice cream at the end. Rest is fine. Would visit again.

This rating is basically dependent on my food order. We ordered crunchy fried chicken which was actually tasty but were made by keeping chicken skin intact.I don't like chicken with skin and thus I cdnt enjoy the dish.
We also ordered chicken kebab which was yummy.so soft that u dnt need to put pressure on ur spoon while cutting.merrily melting in mouth.this was served with yoghurt dip which tasted so awsome that we had to ask for some more
The man who was serving us was gentle n friendly.the place is little bit on pricier side

Not a good place for good food.
Ordered Doi Katla which cost me 140/- but when I received it, I found one small piece with little gravy.
Also ordered Dhakai Chicken which was of 180/- and has three small pieces with little gravy.
There are lot more restaurants nearby to get good food, would recommend people to order from other restaurants but not from here.
Worst in quality, quantity and delivery.

Last Sunday i had mutton biryani and chicken tikka butter masala from them and ordered if from zomato. Mutton biryani was perfect with perfect mix of spices and it was not dry at all. But mutton piece was bit hard.
And about chicken tikka butter masala it was different from mughlai or punjabi restaurants with slightly sour in taste. Only complain is that they have not used tandoori chicken(tikka) instead used normal. Anyway experience from them is great.

This restaurant opened up a few years ago, its premises carved out from a portion of the adjacent Tuli’s Hair Beauty Salon. The decor is average: its table-mats rather common...seen similar ones in another restaurant as well; moreover, the upholstery of some of its sofas already show cracks and marks of wear-n-tear. The food, though, redeems these drawbacks....be it the meinfoon (rice noodles is not included in the menu-card, but is available) or Chicken steak, both the Chinese as well as Continental fare are of a commendable quality. The only occasion when I’ve faced a problem was with their lamb preparation....it was too stiff and could barely be eaten. The other incident happened in peak summer; only one of the two AC machines was working....the wall-fan couldn’t really compensate for the non-functional AC machine. I would ask the restaurant authorities to pull up their housekeeping and maintenance.

Its on the first floor and perhaps a more flashy signage would help locate it for new comers. Thanks to Zomato for locating this

Why RESTAURANTS why?? Why a restaurant, so delectable to non vegetarians, is not even good enough for us vegetarians. What sin have we done? Are we condemned to eat at VEG ONLY places and not enjoy the company of friends who are non vegetarians?

That's what I feel after eating in this place. I might have a biased opinion. If you are great at making non veg north indian food, I see no reason why you cannot make good vegetarian north Indian food.

And that is my basis for rating this place average.
Their tomoato soup was exceedingly good. Much much better than their north Indian curries. Why are their curries bad? Not because the taste of their curries is bad, because THERE IS NO GRAVY.
Both in paneer tikka lababdar, and in paalak paneer you could only find paneer and no gravy. Literally no gravy. If you don't order a daal, you will eat a dry Indian bread with a dry Main course.
If they improve this, they have a lot of potential.
As far as non veg food goes, it's good. No complaints there from my friends.

In recent times, this obscure place has become a favorite of mine for home-deliveries.

This review wouldn't be a complete one since I have never visited the place save for the numerous take-aways.

My favorite orders have been - tandoori chicken which is extremely well marinaded, soft, juicy and suitable. Unlike other places, the two pieces in a half a plate is equivalent to a complete meal.

The other dish worth mentioning is the mushroom matar masala which is lick-smackingly delicious what with its rich thick gravy and adequate amount of mushrooms.

A must for food-lovers!

The plating of the kebab was pretty  amazing too.the best part is honey chicken had chunks of pineapple in it making it all the more delicious.With ch.lasagne they even served two pieces of garlic bread.the paan icecream they served was from pabrai's  and it was no doubt the best.had a lovely experience!
P.s they dont charge service tax..only vat(i.e14.5 pc) on the gross amount.

This small place tucked away near the Gitanjali Stadium at Rajdanga Road is definitely a hidden gem. The ambience was pleasantly sensational and everything seemed spick and span. A neat and uncluttered arrangement with an efficient layout was indeed commendable. The cutlery on the tables well organised, the staff well behaved and the food, amazing.
Ordered a plate of Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala, Butter Naan, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken. The kebabs looked very inviting and were soft, juicy and appetizing. They served it with the traditional pudina chutney and also a white yoghurt sauce which was delicious. The chicken tandoori butter masala was perfectly cooked. The chicken was fresh and unlike many other places it wasn't oily at all. The quantity was appreciable too . The noodles was perfect and the chilli chicken was flavoursome. Loved the food.
Had a great experience and would love to go back and try a few more dishes! Definitely recommended for Chicken lovers.

Located in the main road just opposite to Siemens Building. Nice ambiance inside the Restaurant but the entry is not that much convincing. Food is really awesome but the most positive fact is their service. People always ready to serve with smile & courtesy. We had a group of around 15 Person went there & all were utterly satisfied with the Quality & quantity of the food.  Tasted their Chilly Fish Dry & Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken as starter & in the main course had Mixed Hakka Noodles & Rice with Sweet & Sour Fish and chilly Chicken. The prices of all the items are very much pocket friendly. 

The only point is that they need to improve their entrance a bit & an proper wash room is required. 
Do visit this place with friends and family..

Is this a new gem in town? 
Not yet. 
Crossroad Crystal is no doubt amazing place but then it has to improve in a few aspects.
We had ordered (after reading few reviews on zomato) a gravy chilli chicken ( semi gravy/thick gravy) and a chicken fried rice.

The order was delivered within time which was a plus. The packaging was nice and tight. But as they had charged Rs 12 just for packaging I expected them to at least add better condiments(maybe, a satchet of chilli infused vinegar) rather than just 2 sauce out of which one was a tomato one. (*seriously dude*).

Now, the food part, received mixed reviews. 
We adored the fried rice. Definitely better than those currently available in the nearby region. 2 plates are enough for about 3 people. The rice is cooked to perfection with loads of protein pieces. Loved the quantity and quality. Definitely a try. 😍

The chilli chicken on the other hand wasn't up to the mark. Even though the pieces were soft , the coating had gotten soggy in the watery gravy(even after reminding them to provide it in semi gravy). The taste too had diluted due to the aforementioned problem and was infact 'WATERY'. A mood killer. (Where they lost 1.5 marks)
Overall a satisfactory lunch with few ups and few lows.
Do visit this place.
Happy dining.

Since everything here is so reasonably priced (a mutton biriyani for 185 bucks, for example), when I ordered a vegetarian Tandoori platter for 285 + tax, I was hoping for industrial quantities of food. Instead, the butter rice to accompany the dish was barely enough to feed half a person. 

That's kind of sad, because everything in the platter was really good, including the butter rice /pulao dish.  The two slices of Tandoori Panner were big chunks of soft cottage cheese with a mild Tandoori masala on it. The Tandoori Potatoes, again two pieces, were more bold flavoured and left me wanting for more. But the star was the sweetish mushroom stuffed with paneer filling dish - very rarely have I seen such well-made stuffed vegetables (and with such little oil). The platter came with a yoghurt raita (the pudina chutney was missing) and would have made up for a very hearty meal, had the rice been enough.

A little more attention into such details and this place could turn out to be a hidden gem. Kasba has long needed a place like this - mid range, covering indian and continental, family types for the middle class crowd outside Acropolis Mall, and with food as good as this, this should work well. The service is very prompt and I am keen to go back or order in more from their very diverse menu.

This is one of those underrated restaurants that are really great but sadly, no one talks about them. Located just near the Siemens Building, this restaurant is an ideal place for a family dinner.  The first impression might be a bit underwhelming but don't let that fool you. This one is a gem in Kasba area. 

I ordered Chicken Butter Masala (conventional!), butter naan, and a continental lamb preparation that was the chef's recommendation (can't find the dish in the menu). The chicken was succulent and the aroma was out of this world. The naan, very tender and literally overflowing with butter. The lamb dish was good too, however, its quantity was rather inadequate. 

The inner ambience is generally flashy (lots of bright lights). Nonetheless, the place is calm and cosy. The thing that impressed me most was the service. Very attentive staff and quick service. Commendable. 
Don't miss out on the opportunity and try this one. You won't regret it.

Yesterday we went to crossroad crystal for dinner. The joint is situated at kasba near opposite side of siemens . Very easy to locate. This joint is very small but clean, well decorated. Foods are good and sufficient. We ordered Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Chilli garlic & schezwan chicken. Staffs are very friendly and yes, prices are pocket friendly too. Nothing remarkable, but overall a nice restro. Will visit again.

Located at the heart of Kasba a standard multi cuisine restaurant. Its situated near the Siemens office and popular to the localities and office people. You can find this on the left hand byline while entering kasba from Ruby.

Ambiance & Decor:
A small staircase on which leads to the entrance of the place. A small sized restaurant with a decent sitting capacity inside. Totally a family restaurant.

Food:
Good quantity and fresh made.
1. Chicken fried rice:
Very fresh and good amount of meat available in it. Liked it.
2. Mixed chilli garlic noodles:
Though I liked the taste of the noodles but it was a bit oily. I would recommend to keep that in mind from next time.

3. Chicken in oyster sauce:
Perfectly made was going perfect with the fried rice specially

4. Virgin Mojito: The drink was very refreshing although the presentation needs to be improved and also the glass as well.
Kudos !! Well done!! Keep up the good 

Service: I didn't expect such service from them. Rajeev gave us a warm hospitality and prompt service.Very impressed..

Recommend ..
Well done!! Kudos guys!! Keep up the good work.

Went with a couple of friends to this small eatery tucked away in a bylane of kasba. It was a nice experience.I was delighted to see that all the food were freshly prepared.
Location: At siemens more, kasba. Very easy to locate.
Ambiance: well its a small joint so there isn't much of an ambiance. Some walls are adorned with beautiful wallpaper but some parts has a ground glass finish - this was a let down since some tuni-bulbs from the other side were visible.
Staff: The staff were courteous. Our server Rajiv was very involved and quick with suggestions. He definitely knew the dishes well.
Food and Drinks :
1. Mojito Dream : while this was a delicious concoction of mint leaves, lemon and sugar syrup, i found that the quantity was very less.
2. Mixed fried rice : best dish of the evening. The quantity was great. It was interspersed with healthy portion of diced chicken, egg and prawn. It tasted fresh and quite stupendous.
3. Oyster chicken : this dish had 8 pieces of chicken with generous portion of onions and mushroom.
4. Mixed Chilly Garlic Noodles : This was kind of a let down. Though it was huge in quantity and there were generous portion of diced chicken,egg and prawn, the taste wasn't too great.

I had a lovely experience. Moreover they do not give pork in any of the dishes, so people with religious qualms, it's safe for you.

Got food delivered. Delivery was prompt and on time. Prices are ok. Their continental menu is exciting. Chinese options are good too. Ordered masala kulcha, packs quite a punch. Loved it. Moroccan spiced fish was ok. Wasn't as exciting as I was expecting it to be. Might check out the restaurant again later. Looks like a nice bet.

Looking through Zomato for Chinese restaurants in the vicinity, stumbled upon this place. Never had seen this place before, despite passing by a million times. So with a mix of uncertainty, walked in for lunch today. Well... now with a satisfied tummy, I can say this place definitely surprised me with its food and behaviour. The menu had a whole wide variety to choose from, including lamb. With some suggestions form the staff, we started with Chicken sweet corn soup and Reshmi kabab. Then continued with Teriyaki chicken, Hunan chicken and Chicken Hakka noodles. The food was well-presented; all of the ones we had were very tasty and the staff was courteous. I also found the pricing quite competitive. Request all not to underestimate this place by the location or size. I would love to go back to Crossroad Crystal and would also suggest it to others looking for good tasty Chinese food.

Walked a long way till we reached this place today. Pretty much liked Cantonese Mixed Noodles and the crispy chili baby corn. Didn't try the Indian fare that my friends ordered. But they did mention they loved their orders too. :)

P.S. Excuse the sloppy composition in photos. All of us were very hungry and exhausted when we reached.

This restaurant is just a stones throw away from my place and yet i conveniently bypassed it thinking it would not stand up to my expectations. I really don't know what prompted me to think this way but i sure do know that my intuitions were very very wrong. The food here is delicious. 

I went for their chinese as i wasnt too sure about the quality so i ordered for their chilly prawn as a starter and chicken chilly and noodles as mains. I couldn't fault any of their dishes as every item i had was beautifully done. I am yet to try their conti but i feel self assured that they will not let me down. 

Price wise i find the place little steep. Cannot say much about the ambiance as i ordered in and their delivery was prompt. Overall good food just around the corner which is a bonus for me.

This place is not as grand and luxurious as many other big restaurants. It is a small place with very reasonable price n good ambience. But the service is very good compared to a lot of others, and so is the food. Even the continental dishes are very well prepared... Something that I didn't expect. I had seen the reviews n the ratings in zomato already..and d price was also exactly as per my budget, not exorbitant. So i thought of giving it a try instead of visiting the same restaurants over n over again. And I have to say it was worth it. Food was sumptuous, sufficient, delicious. Everybody enjoyed the food. They did not have a lot of variety for desserts. But the quality n behavior of the staff made up for it. But it would be even better if they can incorporate darsaan with vanilla ice cream in d desserts, if not anything else

This place was accidentally discovered a day before Diwali. We wanted to visit a place in the vicinity not explored earlier. Resorted to Zomato and bingo we reached in ten minutes. I was in a dilemma as to which cuisine to order. Gave everything a miss ,mixed and matched my way. Soups we ordered Chicken Manchow and Cream of Chicken.  Manchow was better than the continental one. Cream of Chicken lacked flavour and was watery for a cream soup. Next fried chicken with barbeque sauce. It was good for the kids. The lasooni chicken tikka was strikingly good. Generously spiced tender chicken cubes chargrilled to perfection. So immediately I wanted another kebab as starter. The Captain was very cooperative and suggested Chicken Kasturi which was again awesome with subtle Kasturi methi aroma.So far so good.  Mains we ordered a Singapore fried rice and Chicken Teriyaki. The fried rice was full bodied with robust flavour. It had more than adequate amount of prawn and Chicken...slightly spicy. Teriyaki was a gastronomic treat.  Tender cubes of chicken grilled in butter and wok tossed in teriyaki sauce. Garnished with roasted sesame seeds. It's a joyful ride for the tastebuds from the Smokey chicken,  tangy sauce and nutty aroma of the sesame. Staff was very courteous and proactive. The Captain asked me to try their Bengali and continental menu next time. Surely would try but I have their north Indian menu in my next visit wishlist.  Recommended ...its a good next door neighbour for me. Enjoyable and affordable.

Just checked in today to taste some continental dishes. To be on the safer side we ordered same old Chicken cream soup, and lasagne. A small cozy food joint well maintained with just right ambiance could not make the visit memorable until the food got served. The courteous staff attended us with tasty dishes. Both were surprisingly great. But the background music..could have played some peppy numbers in the eve rather than those depressing ragas.

Was surprised to find a place that serves/delivers continental food at a reasonable price in kasba.
The food is good and doesn't leave a hole in the pocket. Cannot comment on the ambience as I have never been here but my home delivery experience has always been good. The staff who have interacted over the phone have been courteous and eager to help/put forward their suggestions. Need to mention the lamb lasagna as it's really good! :)

Visited this place on ashtami evening for my birthday treat after a narrow escape from getting bankrupt at royal jade. When we stepped in, nobody else was there yet, but soon as time passed by more people came in for dinner. However my friends and cousin ordered some rice and chicken and lamb items, and ya a kabab for the starter. Sorry i cnt actually remember the exact recipes as i dint have any of these. I ordered a completely different recipe for myself, incredible chicken salad, and believe me, it was just wow, even when my tastebuds weren't really working well because of my fever. Next whenever i visit kasba for ne reason, would love to visit this place for some foods.

So I decided to order from this place today. I ordered 2 Masala Kulcha, 1 Egg Mei Foon and 1 Murg Nazrat Ali. About the process of taking the order and delivery, it was good. Though I had better Kulcha before, I must say this one wasn't bad either. The Mei Foon was tasty, good and it also had very less oil. So plus 5 for that. The Murg Nazrat Ali was awesome. Overall an awesome dinner. 100% recommended for all. Will be ordering from this place again very soon.

This restaurant is situated to the opposite of Siemens building of Kasba at 1st Floor. Ambiance Is good, we went there at 4:30 of the evening, all staffs were lying and sitting, and there was no other customer on that time. We ordered Chicken Hong Kong Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. I never expected that they can serve such delicious Chinese dishes after Royal Jade at Kasba. Food were all cooked well. They served 8 pcs of Medium sized chicken which were too soft, but try to remember one thing that rice quantity is more than enough for one people and less than two people. BTW here I'll try again with some new dishes.

This is a great little place.
They make a great range of very delectable continental food. Nothing outstanding, but then again a consistent goodness that is there is all their dishes.

The Moroccan spiced lamb soup was simply beautiful. Their pastas are single serving portions but very al dente and nicely prepared. The lasagna is definitely worth trying.
The biriyani is decent, but nothing exceptional. The Kebabs were a tad bit on the dry side. Very fluffy, naans though.

___________________

Updated: this used to be a great little place, but 2 weeks ago, I went and ordered the spiced lamb soup and barbecue chicken. The soup was basically meat broth that smelled of ghee and garam masala. The chicken was some Chinese preparation without even the smallest hint of BBQ sauce.

I will make this rather short and quick,for I haven't visited the place,simply resorted to order a home delivery.

Kastaleta ghanam-I was rather curious about this one.It's supposedly an Arabi version of spiced lamb chops,which resemble our very own adrak ki panje,but can be served with gravy.The restaurant didn't disappoint.However I was expecting more generous portions after a glimpse at google images.

Veg Au Gratin-That literally means  vegetable baked in cheese.They didn't do anything over the top,no dressing or innovative add-ons,but the food was very 
delectable,and left me pleased as a punch.A must try for foodies.

Baked fish florentine-I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you guys that fish florentine isn't supposed to look like this(probably).The restaurant baked the fish in 
cheese,and served it on a spinach base.However,be rest assured,the combo placates the buds and makes this recommended as well.

Mutton biryani-It's strange to order a lone north indian/tandoor item along with continentals,but I wanted to see how well versatile they are.And surprisingly the 
innocuous and unsuspecting biryani was the best of the lot,along with au gratin.The rice was mildly spiced,duly oily and the aroma and taste distinctly independent of 

the park circus influence.It came with a piece of raita,an egg,thee small minces of mutton,and no potato.A must try for foodies.

All good experiences go bad when you have on terrible experience. A ruthless staff with horrible behaviour. Ordered a fish salad which was filled with smelly fish, on asking them to change the entire salad which was lying enact, the staff misbehaved and did not do it. Have ordered food many times before from here, being a regular customer they would not think before disappointing you.

It's a small cosy place just bang opposite to our office & hence we started visiting it frequently. But the visits were more due to the taste rather than our compulsions. This place serves Continental dishes which are just superb. My best take is Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce on a bed of Couscous & Toddy Chicken. The only drawback is their huge delay in Serving. And Yes, the prices are very much pocket friendly.

After reading some lovely reviews, decided to drop by this place today with a friend. Located opposite to Siemens on the first floor of the cakes shop, this place is easy to find. Food was pretty awesome, wasnt disappointed at all.  We ordered pan shared honey chicken, chicken hongkong fried rice, chicken manchurian rice and chicken in pepper & black bean gravy. The pan shared honey chicken was delicious of all. Other items were good as well. Quantity was also sufficient. Ambience is okayish. The waiters were very friendly and helped us to decide on the food.
However the price in zomato is misleading. It would cost 700 bucks approx for a sufficient meal. But the quality pretty much makes up for it. Planning to visit again :-)

In an effort to find decent eatery at Kasba came across this joint through Zomato. Located Ruby connector main road opposite Siemens above Cakes store. Small restaurant seating capacity of 30 odd people with basic ambiance. We opted for take away though.
In starters he ordered Chicken Lollipop and Pan Seared Honey Chicken. Chicken Lollipop was spicy and juicy while honey chicken was too sweet to my liking but pieces are succulent.
In main course we had Lacha Naan and Chicken Butter Masala. Lacha Naan is unique concept with layered naan. Not thick as traditional naan but soft and flaky. Chicken Butter Masala is again too sweet and lack taste of spices.
Staff are courteous but the restaurant has ways to cover to bring consistency across all dishes.

This one was a delightful find! It's extremely easy to locate - it's right above the Cakes outlet in Kasba, diagonally opposite to Siemens. My friend and I went in for an early dinner. It was a Monday evening,  so we weren't that surprised to find the place completely empty. The decor is clean and comfortable, with soothing lighting. The staff was quite attentive as well. 

Coming to food, my friend ordered a pan fried chicken with mushroom sauce for herself. I wanted to try the Balinese hot toddy chicken. But it wasn't available so I settled for paprika chicken, as suggested by the staff. 

The panfried chicken was really well done! The chicken was soft, with a slight cheesy filling inside. The mashed potato and sauted vegetables were delicious. 

The paprika chicken comes with quite a big serving of rice - well big for me, as I'm a light eater. My friend and I shared this one. It was great as well - the rice wasn't too oily and the shredded chicken with the moderate gravy was done perfectly. Loved the taste!

I can't believe I never noticed this place, after living in this area for a decade and half! The prices are reasonable, the interiors are pleasant, the staff is responsive and the food is heavenly! I'll keep going back to try the rest of the menu! Highly recommended!

Visted this restaurant one late rainy afternoon. As all the possible options in that area were closed and a friend suggested it we decided to go for it. It's not a flashy restaurant. Located on the second floor of a hotel,the ambience is decent. The menu seemed to be overpriced and we were a dubious about what to order. We decided to have two varied types of indian combo meal. The meals comprised of very simple food. Rice,dal,aloo bhaja,chicken curry,fish and one veg item I cannot recall. The food and took us by surprised. Not only was the quantity really good,the taste of each and every item was reallllly good. We later also order prawn noodles,which was also amazing. The experience was really nice. I plan to try out their continental food next time. So if you are in kasba,this is the place you absolutely NEED to visit.

Calcutta has a lot of places wiyh Continental servings but this place is a standard by its own. The chefs make it a point to get that heavenly taste in every serving. To the extent where they come out and ask u..."how do u like it...if u dont..then I can change it"...this is absolute customer delight...
Fantastic Continental...never got the chance to try anythin else...am sure whatever they serve..will be good...sorry excellent. ..
What a place!!!

After reading some lovely reviews, decided to drop by this place today with a friend. Located opposite to Siemens on the first floor of the cakes shop, this place is easy to find. Food was pretty awesome, wasnt disappointed at all.  We ordered pan shared honey chicken, chicken hongkong fried rice, chicken manchurian rice and chicken in pepper & black bean gravy. The pan shared honey chicken was delicious of all. Other items were good as well. Quantity was also sufficient. Ambience is okayish. The waiters were very friendly and helped us to decide on the food.
However the price in zomato is misleading. It would cost 700 bucks approx for a sufficient meal. But the quality pretty much makes up for it. Planning to visit again :-)

In an effort to find decent eatery at Kasba came across this joint through Zomato. Located Ruby connector main road opposite Siemens above Cakes store. Small restaurant seating capacity of 30 odd people with basic ambiance. We opted for take away though.
In starters he ordered Chicken Lollipop and Pan Seared Honey Chicken. Chicken Lollipop was spicy and juicy while honey chicken was too sweet to my liking but pieces are succulent.
In main course we had Lacha Naan and Chicken Butter Masala. Lacha Naan is unique concept with layered naan. Not thick as traditional naan but soft and flaky. Chicken Butter Masala is again too sweet and lack taste of spices.
Staff are courteous but the restaurant has ways to cover to bring consistency across all dishes.

Checked out this restaurant yesterday, after a long time.. Heard rave reviews about this place and finally we ended up ordering a home delivery of a minimal amount of food..
Went with the traditional chicken Hakka noodles, which was okay, nothing out of the ordinary..
Babycorn and mushroom with chicken was again, average, the quantity was okay, and the white sauce could have been much better..
The last item was undoubtedly the best, pan shredded chicken in honey was absolutely brilliant, had a nice taste to it, which I didn't find anywhere else..
However, beware, the food is extremely expensive, mainly because they take VAT, which is a bit surprising, since 90% of the restaurants in the Kasba connector belt don't take VAT, and specially because we didn't dine in and order home delivery.. Considering the prices, (we had to shell out close to Rs. 750) only for these items, I would say it is only just average..

Need a pocket friendly stop for a fine bite? 

Search no more! 

Aside from their relatively slow service, I have absolutely nothing remotely bad to say about this place!
They have served up beautiful, quality food each and everytime. 

If you need help choosing from their vast menu, I'd suggest choosing any of their continental dishes! You cannot go wrong. Their lebanese chicken with cous cous is a delight. 

Also, whatever may your order be, please try their nolen gur ice cream. It's beautiful and provides the perfect closure to a good meal!

We were a big group of around 12 people and went there without any prior booking. So, service was slightly slow, but was made up with the good food served out there. They boast of a big menu, from continental to Mughlai, Chinese to Indian, we decided to settle down on the Mughlai and Indian menus. We ordered Reshmi Kebab and Kasturi Kebab to start with. The kebabs were fresh and extremely succulent, much to our likings... For main course, we ordered Butter Nun and Garlic Nun along with Chicken Do Piyaaza and Chicken Lababdar. And I would say, all the foods tasted quite good. The quantity was good and the people out there were polite and came up with some good suggestion. 

This place is quite easy to locate, being just opposite to Siemens (Near Kasba). The price is also quite decent. Overall, a good experience and a place worth recommendation....

Aptly located at Kasba, this restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes in Continental, Chinese, Indian and even Bengali. There are lot of items to choose from. The attention given to the customers is also very personalized. The cuisine is also on the good side, However, the place is quite small and I would like to suggest the management to expand.

If your looking for delicious food in a reasonable price then your in the right place, it's a small restaurant above cakes, I had come here with my grandparents and mother, her sister, her son and my brother, there were 7 of us the bill came around 1800 .we had ordered cheese garlic naan which was lovely, you can easily taste the flavour of the cheese and garlic. the tandoori chicken was real good, it was moist and juicy and had the right amount of spices. the cream if chicken soup was lovely and u can taste the lively flavour of the chicken stock. for curries, we had ordered chicken methi malai & mutton do pyaza, the chicken methi malai was by far the best methi curry I ever ate, the mutton do pyaza was tasty and little spicy. the cheese masala dosa was crispy and the potato inside was nicely seasoned, they give u 3 different chutneys with it which was delicious. the chicken lasagna was really mouth watering, it had chicken nicely seasoned with several different herbs and spices, it had 3 sheets of lasagna and a nice generous layer of cheese on top. overall the food was real good and the service was explicit, the food took a lot of time to arrive because they make everything from scratch and the restaurant also does not charge any service charge.

If you are looking for a worth for money restaurant that maintains better quality as well, in Ruby, Kasba area then definitely you should go to this place.
Foods like different types of Kebabs, Chinese  are well.
If you are a Biriyani hunter then may be you will not be so happy but you should definitely try their continental food specially Hot Toddy Chicken. Its lovely, specially cooked chicken served with smashed potato and boiled vegetables. Its really great. ...  :)

One of the best Chinese restaurants in Kasba. Looking at the restaurant, it is quite ordinary and small restaurant located on the first floor of a building. However, the food is very premium and everything is quite professional.

Talking about the food, the restaurant is a multi-cuisine restaurant however is famous for its Chinese preparations. I recently tried out Pan Shredded Chicken with Honey and Chicken in Pepper and Black Bean Gravy, both were awesome. Hakka Noodles and Fried Rice are also nice.

Quantity is however a bit low, only for Gravy and Starters. Noodles and Fried Rice quantity seems perfect to me. Prices are a bit high, but that's alright as the food is really delicious. Service is really great and home delivery is quick.

So, a small little restaurant and if you live nearby, you should try ordering from here.

Crossroad Crystal is just a 2 minute walk from my house and I totaly love this place.
Ambience is good but it's a pretty small place which can fit around 30 people.

Now coming to the food.
We ordered :-
1) Crispy Chilly Babycorn : Wherever I go, I make it a point to have this. And it wss heavenly. Perfect. Yummilicious.

2) Drums of heaven : The first bite and omfg. :O ♡

3) Fried Fish : Smooth and fat fillet of fish coated with a unique coating which makes it even better. Served with potatoes. Awesome.

4) Chicken sweet corn soup : Nice.

5)Laccha Naan : A very innovative idea. An indian bread representing both laccha and naan.

6) Chicken butter masala : My all time favourite. I can bet that no other place on earth serves better Chicken butter masala.

7) Fried Rice : Authentic one with a lot of chicken, prawn ang egg.

8) Hunan Chicken : It had a raw taste of red wine because of which I dint like it much. But one of my friends loved it.

9) Panfried chicken with mashed potatoes : A chicken breast stuffed with cheese and then pan fried. It is served with mashed potatoes and sauted vegetables. The mashed potatoes were again the best I have ever had.

10) Chicken Lasagne : Delicious but nothing outstanding.

The bill came around 3000 bucks.
Totally worth it.
RECOMMENDED. :D

Nice place. Good food, good service, nice ambience. You can expect to have a nice, quiet meal here, with your close ones. As suggested by other reviewers, serving could come a bit faster, specially if you are by yourself or so hungry that you can chew the waiter off. But otherwise you should do fine. Now for this restaurant I'd say chinese> continental> indian. But please dont think indian would be bad and not worth your money. Try to avoid naans though...overall nice experience

Superb! That's what the food was... We landed there on a Friday evening after debating on which place to go for awhile and we were amazed! The ambiance & food get double thumbs up. The only drawback is that there is a long wait time between the placing of the order and when you finally get it.
We were a group of 5 people. We ordered the Prawn cocktail as a starter. They said that their portion included 4 prawns, however as we were 5 we requested them to give us an extra prawn and they readily accommodated. The taste & presentation just perfect. The prawns were juicy and had not turned rubbery.
For the main course we ordered the Balinese Chicken and it’s the absolute must – have item on the menu! Succulent roasted chicken breast with skin on served with lovely tossed greens & baked potatoes. The portion size might be a little small for a heavy eater.
The next was the Russian staple, Chicken Stroganoff! One of the best I have had in Kolkata, and they didn't go wrong! 
I had ordered the Lebanese Chicken with Cous Cous. The chicken gravy was very well seasoned and the cous cous was light, fluffy & bursting with flavours! Just as it should be, 10 on 10 again.
We also ordered the Grilled Prawn with Turmeric Risotto. The prawns again were very big in size & cooked to perfection. The risotto felt that it had been slightly over cooked but thankfully it didn't smell of turmeric.
The last dish was the Moroccan fish! I would recommend only those who are highly adventurous to try this dish. The flavors are quite strong so not everybody may take a liking to it.
Final verdict, definitely worth the wait but the next time I would like to pre – order and go, a suggestion they had given themselves when we had called for reservations!

Well, the price given here is definitely misleading....you will atleat have to shed out 600 bucks for a standard meal for two. Tge thing I like the most about this place is their small and cosy ambiance. This place may get claustrophobic if there is a crowd, but such is not the case mostly. One dish I loved was the fish fry. Iyt was really unique. It looked nice, had a crispy layer and its succulent insides really make it one of the best I have had. 

There is not much hype around this place, but it may be the best place for an evening eat-out

As much as you will feel a sense of foreboding as you walk up the narrow staircase to this small restaurant,  tucked into one corner of an unimpressive building which is bathed in a facade of a tacky blue light, shake it off. This place is likely to blow you away with its food. 
The menu in itself is vast! We finally settled for a continental meal. 
Starting with the prawn cocktail, with immaculately cooked prawns and a pertect balance of sweetness and acidity in the sauce, we were off to a promising start!
--We ordered a Balinese "hot tody" chicken, which was a braised chicken breast, bathed in a light, almost islandlike, sauce. The sauce complimented the chicken beautifully. My only complaint with this dish would be the mashed potatoes. They were lumpy and inconsistent. 
-- We also ordered the Lebanese Chicken with couscous bread. Again, very well spiced chicken curry and the couscous accompanied it perfectly.  
-- The roasted prawns with a lemony risotto with a lemon butter sauce had perfectly cooked prawns with a light tangy sauce which was beautiful. However, the risotto neeeds work.  It was overly glutinous and left a fatty aftertaste. 
-- The final dish ordered was Lamb cooked Lebanese style served with a spiced rice. This was easily mt favorite.  Beautifully cooked lamb with just the right balance of spices.  
-- Finally, we ordered the Nolen Gur icecream, which is hands down the best Nolen Gur infused icecream I have ever tasted. Its light and not overly sweet and yet it manages to provide an explosion of Nolen gur with every spoon. 
Not only does this place have good food, the staff is well trained and it is very very light on your pocket!
I'd recommend this place to everyone! 
I'll be going back soon to try the Chinese!
