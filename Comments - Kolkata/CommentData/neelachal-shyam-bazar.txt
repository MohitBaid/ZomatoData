Situated beside Bagbazar Multipurpose School in a lane named Basubatu Lane,it is a small place serving decent food at a good price. I had chicken kathi which costs Rs. 30. It had 6 chunks of chicken with capsicum and onion pieces between them and the whole thing was coated with a batter. They fried it and served it hot with salad and sauce. The taste was very good,crispy on the outside and succulent chicken pieces on the inside. I will visit this place again.

At very past of 90s dis outlet was considered as a best option for chinese oriental food ..located at bagbazar street ...was very famous for its macher kachori.

Bt time has gone...it also loses its authenticacity ...now the elegance was jst history ...macher kachori was available bt not found dat charm...noodles are so oliy and less vegetables ..bad Experience

Once a very renowned eatery in the Shyambazar area. Now however, with all the new restaurants and fast food joints coming up, they find it difficult to keep pace. The place is difficult to spot, no sitting arrangements either. Since I have been a regular since long back, I can say that the tastes have deteriorated. But if one is looking for an economical fast food experience including 'vajavuji' and the Indian versions of Chinese, this can be an option

This is a hidden gem in baghbazr. Situated in a lane, towards bagbazr multi purpose school, this one is a kind if bangali der para r dokan which serves really tasty food, and is gd for casual frnds hangout after tuitions. Been thr many times, it might not have proper sitting arrangements, like most of the north kolkata local joints, but it won't disappoint you with its food.

Another classic, age old street food stall in N.kolkata!!!!

* Location : At a by lane of famous Bagbazar street,just beside Bagbazar Multipurpose School.

* Ambience : Its a street food stall and you can never expect any kind of better ambience than eating on an open road experience. 👌👌 Small benches are there for customers and if you cant eat the plate taking in hand (as me), they provide you extra table. So, I can eat there very comfortably. The benches are famous for adda joint may it be aged persons or school,college students.

* Food : After visiting for more than 15 years in this street food stall, I can easily say that some years before the quality of the foods were way better though varieties were less. Now they are increasing varieties of chicken, fish items; but my food appetizer can't be satisfied with it. 👎👎👎Yet I can say you about the best items they are still famous for....
1. FISH FRY ( very crispy, munchy, good quality of fish they give, a thin coating, a big one....but very cheap according to the amount of fish they give)(rating 10 on 10). 👍👍👍
2. CHICKEN CHOWMEIN OR MIXED CHOWMEIN ( quantity is very good as you compare the price, not too much oily, good amount of chicken and prawn they provide,you cant get this much chicken or prawn in any street food stall. I like best the sauces they give with the chow. Its not at all cheap street stall chilly or tomato sauces. They provide good,branded sauce.) (rating 9 on 10). 👌👌👌
3. KATHI CHICKEN ( it is their special innovation. Just as sheekh kebab,you ll find a tiny kathi inside which pieces of 6 chickens are garnished and cooked finely with pieces of tomato, capsicum and onion; less oily also. It is must recommended,heavenly taste) (rating 10 on 10) 👏👏👏

* Must recommended : 1. FISH FRY (VERY TASTY) 👌👌👌
2. KATHI CHICKEN ( VERY INNOVATIVE AND HEAVENLY TASTE) 👌👌👌@priyabrata ganguly

Been there few times but the experience was okay 👌 as the food 🍴 was too spicy with very few options. Actually it's more like a roadside stall.
