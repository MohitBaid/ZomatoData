This resturant always fail to deliver in time, infact they will take additional 40 minutes to deliver. Absolutely rubbish. What happens next is worse. The food is cold like ice. Never going to order again. Is this Zomato's fault or the Resturant's ?

My first reaction was "wow... what is this ... 40%off!!"
Then I learned my lesson . 
The food quality was like normal footpath quality . 
Not even restaurant quality . 
I ordered chicken noodles, crispy chicken , chicken pokora.  
The worst quantity !!!

1. Chicken pokora : they are cold and very small pieces . I think you should not spend that amount and get small pieces.

2. Crispy chicken : full with vegetables . 
I did not order vegetables . I ordered crispy chicken . 
The quantity of chicken is les.
Like 7 is vegetable and 3 is chicken .( in 10)
People spend money for crispyness and chicken .

3. Noodles . :you will laugh if u see quantity.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. A small bowl . And u spend nearly 150 . 
The taste was good . But I don't think I will spend again 150 for it . 


Lesson learned never buy in offers . U will get worst foods üòÇ

I had ordered a veg Hakka noodles and veg Manchurian.
Like most of the others I also went by the discount the restraunt is offering i e 40% on online orders
The food was pathetic. The oil used was smelling bad. I have never had such horrible noodles in my entire life.
It seemed as if they just boiled the noodles and delivered it without any sauce or any herbs. 
Even the Manchurian balls were smelling. 
I threw the entire food.
Nobody wants a discount of even 100% when the food sucks.
Donot order from this place ever.

I ordered their food online and got it delivered at my place..i got the food at a very lucrative discount on zomato...
Food was good with quantity and quality both,only dissapointment was cripy chicken that wasn't crispy instead very soft and tendered like chilli baby corn.. It may be so due to travelling factor or so..I dont know whether it will make any difference like going there and having but i would prefer ordering food online here..üòä
Ordered for the following:
1) Mixed Fried Rice. 150 INR
2) Crispy Chicken. 150 INR
3) Chicken Pakoras. 90 INR
Which in totality amounts to 390 INR so i got a discount of 40% and got the deal@ 254 INR.üòâ

It's ok about the quantity provided with the price.. Atleast the taste of the items should be improved. Not a better option to order from this. Try out other restaurants.

Ordered online -------------- Veg Fried Rice with Hot Garlic sauce (as Schezwan sauce was not available)

The PROS :- Low cost at rs 55/- and rs 5/- extra for the added sauce. Good quanity and good amount of veggies added in it. Fresh. Got the delivery much more earlier than 50 mins. As I had ordered for the Schezwan sauce, one of the lady staff called for informing its non-availability. Communication was polite. Packaging was good & they also provided Tissue papers, spoons & Pass- Pass ( Mouth Freshner).

The CONS :- Didn't tasted that much good. They provided the Garlic sauce in another sachets. Didn't like the Garlic sauce's taste too. If in future I ordered again for any added sauce, wish they could mixed it while cooking rather than providing it in sachets.

This is a take away restaurant, Exactly behind amania   chinarpark. I was really surprised to see the price it's really cheap. But when I ordered food I was really disappointed. I ordered paneer pakoda which was just fried in oil without any coating, then fish curry quantity was very less. Overall food was also not tasty...don't go by the price...it's just a trap nothing else

We ordered from this place yesterday and as regards the delivery , it has been a speedy one .

Talking about the food, we ordered 'paneer pakora' , 'aloo bhaja' and 'mixed veg'. Although none of the dishes except paneer pakora were too extraordinarily delicious but getting such fresh items at an affordable rate was beyond our expectation.

Overall, this place deserves to be rated positively . ‚ò∫

Just did my first order in this restaurant .i had ordered 2 ruhi posto and 1 plain rice .The guy that arrived gave me 2 containers .I thought maybe both the ruhi are in one container .I paid the guy he left and i went upstairs opened boxes to find 1 ruhi posto and 1 plain rice .I kept trying to call back the person that delivered the food and no one is picking up the call .The quality of the food is good for its price but pretty dissapointed how they can make such a mistake .Even the bill is written 2x ruhi posto and 1x plain rice but they delivered 1x ruhi posto and 1x plain rice .Called up zomato they were nice enuff to giv me credit for the other plate .

I hope you guys read this review and do something with the service because i called you guys 5 mins later after you delivered food to inform that i am missing 1 item
