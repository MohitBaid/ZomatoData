A homely confectionery, cause that is what they truly are. They do not have a store or a shop and they operate from home. But it does not take away anything from their professionalism, not in the least bit. Having gone through the lovely reviews here, I ordered for their signature Chocolate Ganache cake along with a few panda cup cakes.
The Ganache cake was simply stunning to say the least.... One of the best chocolate cakes that I have had in a long time. My family found it delightful too. A  one pound cake was devoured in no time and the only regret was that probably I should have ordered a 2 pounds one. The cupcakes were standard.
The hospitality, that I faced on my visit to pick up the order was something which was really touching. Another issue I want to raise is that of the prices.... cause I can say with firm conviction that nowhere in town will you get such high quality cakes at such reasonable prices.... which is definitely another feather in their cap.
The first of many orders to follow from my side for sure.... Keep up the good work.

To be honest, I consider myself lucky to have had the privilege of savouring the delicacies prepared by 4B, Bakery Street. I'm absolutely a fan of their bakery products. My personal favourites‚Äã are their chocolates (Fantabulous! Please please try!) and their pies (Simply yum) and their cupcakes ( Innovation at it's best) and their cakes ( heavenly for dessert lovers like me) and the list goes on....

The person behind this gem of a place is an Aunty, ably helped by her family, who tirelessly strive to deliver you quality food served with extra love and care.

I urge you to please place an order of few of their delicacies like i did few years ago. Trust me, you will love it. It's that amazing. It's my guarantee that you will become an‚Äã ardent lover of this place once you taste the items. Till then, happy eating :)

Orange we glad we had your cheesecake? Or should I say, tu cheese(cake) bari hai mast mast? Well, that's exactly how I felt!

City of joy, make way for the homeliest bakery in town! A couple of my friends and I had the privilege of getting our, err, tongues into their orange cheesecake. The perfect texture, the right balance of sweet and tang, the crust that exactly complemented the cake, it was an explosion of happy flavours. We had it really cold and the smoothness of the cake (along with the topping of fresh oranges) couldn't have been more complete. I would also like to add that they are one of the very few places to serve dessert cheesecakes (frozen, not the regular baked).
The reason I call them the homeliest bakery is because of the experience I had while picking the cake up from 4B. Perched on the first floor of a 'bonedi' South Calcutta house, their setup looks exactly like home. For it is their home. A loud shoutout to the people behind the establishment. Spearheaded by the warmest Aunty, and backed by two of the friendliest sidekicks, she ensures that every thing at 4B Bakery Street is baked with love. Oh, did I mention? Aunty threw in a few of her special mint chocolates, ekdum mufft mufft mufft! Can I say, 4B Bakery Street earned some 'brownie points' (:P) for the generosity? 
Anyway, what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? ORDER NOW NOW NOW!

One of the best bakeries I have tried. I had the Chocolate Ganache cake and also tried the Walnut Brownie. The taste of the food here is amazing.

When you first call them to preorder the cake, you are immediately greeted by a motherly voice, and there is a homely feeling as you realise that your order is their chief priority. As a family establishment they are extremely friendly and pay attention to what you need.

The Ganache cake itself was beautiful and extremely tasty, as you can feel every alternate layer melting in your mouth. The generous amount of filling adds to the experience. The brownies were opposite as the Walnut Brownie was like one consistent layer full of immensely heavy chocolate. The perfect dessert after a light meal it fills the stomach and satisfies. 

Will definitely be ordering again to try out their other cakes.

Had the privilege to have their cupcakes... We ordered them for a special purpose n this these were customised.. The way I wanted them it was made exactly like that.  The presentation was excellent and eye catching.. About the taste of the cupcakes those were simply yummy and chocolaty... They were very reasonably prized... Overall I am very satisfied...

One of the very few places in Kolkata that offers completely homemade confectioneries delivered to you, so that you can feast your sweet tooth right at the comfort of your home. 
Coming to the products that it offers, i ordered a walnut brownie and chocolate ganache. Both these completely drooled me over. Brownie being one of the best i had eaten in a long time (and i visit a lot of places and have a lot of brownies). 
Next on my to-eat list is the cheesecake which i have high expectations from due to the good taste that the other two products left me with. 
Keep it up guys :)

One of the best places around if you want to indulge in some of the most delicious cakes at pocket friendly prices. The Strawberry Geateau is heavenly! The Cookies and Cream was equally brilliant! Thank you for making my birthday so special with a drool-worthy Orange Gateau. <3

The produce here has to be one of the best in Kolkata.
The home baked delicious cakes and pastries is just worth going for. 
Have tried the strawberry and the orange gateau..It comes topped with fresh fruits and cream which is out of the world. Also the black forest which is perfect for the chocolate lovers!
Thumbs up to the quality too.
