This is a great place for a small snack before going in for a movie at the adjoining Jaya cinema hall. However, when I visited last, we decided to ditch the usual rolls for two plates of noddles and some sweet and sour fish. The quantities were appropriate, but the fish was a bit stale for my liking, and the seating could've been better.

Good place for rolls, momos, pakora, fish fry and any kind of fast food with a reasonable price and good quality. Only thing is it's always crowded and takes time to serve the orders. Located just opposite to Jaya Cinema Hall, this place is a hot favorite of many localites.

Had ordered two different soups.. one was chicken soup and the other was hot n sour chicken soup. They took 45 mins approx to serve two items.. chicken soup was good, but hot and sour soup was very very spicy. When we spoke to the manager, his answer was that hot and sour soup is like this only. Food joints are known for serving good food, but must say they have a very bad way of treating their customers. Poor hospitality, poor quality of food.

What to say about King's Grill. I have seen this restaurant being started before me. It used to be a small Roll center, run by a group of friends. Over the years, this place have proved its worth to be called as one of the finest take-away center in the city. If you are planning to watch a movie at Jaya Cinema, then please make some time to visit this place. Though the price is little bit on the higher side, you will never regret the experience.

One of the earliest Street food corner located just opposite jaya cinema in lake town. The sitting arrangement consists of benches placed outside the shop. They serve good rolls and momos. One might also try the noodles. The service though is a bit slow as it is always packed up. The price is pocket friendly. Its better for takeaway

Kolkata, the city of joy, is famous for the abundance and variety of cuisines that can be found. But it is not just the big and shiny restaurants with their fancy bells and whistles that make Kolkata a heaven for foodies. The little eateries have a great role too. Tucked away at every nook and cranny are these little gems which are famous for one thing and one thing alone, the food. Such a small wonder is King's Grill. 

Located at the heart of Lake Town, right across the street from Jaya Cinema Hall, King's Grill offers good food at a very reasonable price. The main features from the menu are - Mixed Chowmein, Fish Finger and Garlic Fish. But the most famous one is the Chicken Roll, the spiced pieces of chicken wrapped in paratha are a wholesome treat for the tastebuds.

A word of caution though, King's Grill is just your average round the corner eatery, there is only a single bench to sit by the walkway. So it is advisable to opt for take-away. Overall, if you are in Lake Town and feeling particularly hungry, King's Grill must be on your watchlist.

This rating is not based on the ambiance. I can just ignore the sound of buzzing horns with one bite of chicken roll from king's grill. In all these years the rolls from this place is still my favourite. The rates are very nominal. Located opposite to Jaya Cinema in lake Town it is almost always crowded. Value for your money.

If I am asked to describe this place in one word, I would simply say "Mind blowing". I have come across this place several times during my regular commute and finally today I dropped in here. The place is very small with no seating arrangement. They serve both north indian as well as chinese preparations. I took one egg chicken roll which cost only 48 rupees. The first bite brought an excellent feel of royal mughlai flavour. The reason being they don't use normal fried chicken pieces instead they use proper marinated kebabs as the fillers of the roll.
Pros :
1. Superv taste
2. Pocket friendly
3. Location(just diagonally opposite to Jaya cinema hall)

Cons:
1. Only cash payment
2. No seating arrangement

Located in the heart of Lake Town, this famous eatery is located opposite to Jaya Cinema Hall. Specialising in Snacks, Chinese and Indian dishes, the place is so much crowded that even if you order an egg roll, you have to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes. And trust me, its worth the wait. The only con of this place is that they don't have proper sitting arrangement except for a wooden bench that lies infront of the fast food center. But yes, next time, if you are in Lake Town, be sure to try out this eatery.

'Bepok' is the word I will use to describe the egg roll I tasted at this outlet last evening. I was hungry and was craving for some Street food when a friend suggested this place. Located opposite to Jaya cinema this food joint is  busy serving the customers throughout the day. The menu hung outside has a lot of options starting from rolls, soups, starters to noodles and rice items as well. It's a decent and clean outlet with a lot of hustle bustle and good food. We ordered for 2 egg rolls and a plate of fish fingers. The roll was outstanding in taste and the crispness of the paratha is something that I missed a lot. Perfectly made egg roll with a lot of great chillies and minimal sauce made the item excellent. The fish fingers were equally good. Total of 6 pieces served with cucumber and onion and potato wedges makes this item commendable. The kasundi or mustard sauce enhances the taste of the fish fingers even more. It's a street side outlet with zero ambiance. The wooden benches provided on the Footpath are the only luxury items to sit and chat while savouring the delicious dishes prepared. A pocket friendly food joint with an excellent service and quality of food.

 Tried their Fried Chilli Chicken and Egg Chicken Noodles. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy. Quality and quantity of the items were also good. 

I recommend this place to everyone to try once if you are in the locality. Will definitely visit again to try their rolls....

This place is quite known for its rolls and momos. It's at a very busy intersection near jaya cinema hall which makes it a very busy joint throughout the day. The provide soup with the momos , and personally I find the soup tastier than the momo. The momo ain't very juicy if you ask me but definitely better than many in and around dum dum. The rolls have good stuffing and are light on oil. But I guess the price could have been a tad lower.

This place is located right opposite Jaya Cinema Hall in Lake Town. It's always crowded after 5 in the evening. So, it's not at all hard to locate.

Well, I just have this much to say. That, they make one of the best rolls in Kolkata and I have Rolls at many good places. So, yeah.
Also try their momo. The only thing that stops me from giving a 4 is that they lack a dining place. So just go, order and takeaway.

Cheap and worth every penny.

Although the quality of rolls have gone down over the years, its difficult to find an alternative to this roll joint in this area. Do try the double egg double chicken roll. It also serves chinese takeaway dishes. We tried chicken chilly, prawn manchurian, mushroom chilly with fried rice. The quantity is good enough and the quality is standard. Since so seating is available,often you need to wait especially in peak hours of the evening. Overall, 3.5/5.

King's Grill dates way back to the time when I was a kid and did not have an understanding rich enough to differentiate between good rolls and bad rolls. Those days rolls were rolls. Later when I grew up and developed the understanding, I realised King's Grill could not be turned down just like that.
There are days when I still take that walk to have a bite of their Egg Chicken Roll. It tastes and smells pleasant, but what delights me most is the memory that circles around me about this place while I wait for the roll to be served.
P.S. The wait time at King's Grill should be looked after. It is growing year on year, gets slightly annoying at times.

If you are in the region and want to take away food, then this is the place to go!!

In the hundreds of times I have gone here I have never been disappointed with their food.....its nothing fancy....but I really do feel that their rolls are up there with the best!!! top notch!!! the other items like chilly chicken and other rices are good too with more than adequate quantity! the no seating is kind of a bummer but its street food and parcel takeouts and they are pretty damn good at that! if you want an inexpensive meal to take to your home or if you wanna enjoy some of the best rolls in the city (except for the fancy jabbr afghanis and gr8 rolls) close your eyes and place your orders without a second thought. its one of the safest options out there!

The rolls. I love it how they half-fry the onions before spreading. I eat from Kings Grill and Mahalaya at least twice a week, as do many other people living in Lake Town.

I wen t for an outing in a weekend evening. I was there in laketown searching for some street food. Suddenly I stopped in front of king's grill which is located in lake town just opposite to popular jaya cinema. I heard about their rolls but on that day I prefer fish fry. It took 10 mins to come to me and when I had my first bite a sound comes like ummmm...it was too crispy. I asked them for some chilli sauce to taste it more. And I paid just rupees 40 for that. Great!!! Will visit again.

The only way you can judge a roll shop is by how many people are waiting for rolls . Even on week days this place is bustling with crowd. 

Since I'm a vegan, I only have Paneer Roll here and I love the roll served by them...always...I have had rolls at so many places, but this is my personal favorite.
And the best part is the pricing . Its absolutely pocket friendly.  

The service is fast, people at the counter are very friendly, and the rolls are delicious .

It was a very favourite joint since my school days..located near to jaya cinema so it was always a place visited after movies..this joint is famous for its street food and snacks which i loved a lot..

i have tried its double chicken egg rolls,fish fry,fish kabiraji,chicken kabiraji,fish finger ,chicken lollipop..and their chowmein is very very tasty..they have huge sale and its always crowded with food lovers..they even serve north indian and chinese ..it serves some finger licking food which will leave a memorable taste u can never forget..

service is good but sometimes due to huge crowd u have to wait...but the tasty food served by them compensates for it..price is very reasonable ..just love it .!

This place is always crowded in the evening since it is located at stones throw distance from Jaya Cinema hall in laketown. The food joint serves rolls, parathas, momos, fish fry, chicken pakodas etc. Their rolls are very tasty and highly recommended. Parathas and side dishes are also good and so are their chowmeins. At reasonable price, they serve pretty tasty food which is the primary reason why people flock to this place.

Be prepared to stand as there is hardly any decent sitting arrangement. The food joint is right on the pavement. Also, you might have to wait as  sometimes, their waiting time can be really long if the crowd is large and they have large number of orders.

They serve quality chinese items cooked in Kolkata style. The favorite picks are-
Chilly Fish - Dry
Chilly Chicken - Dry
Mixed Fried Rice
Apart from these,  
Fish fry
Fish finger are few of the hot picks 

Pros

1. Tasty preparations, though not authentic Chinese.
2. Adequate quantity

Cons

1. No dine in facility
2. No home delivery
3. Very long service time that may range 
 even upto 45mins.

Food here is terribly good! 
Their quantity and quality both are superb. Only one drawback is that one has to wait much here. Both North Indian as well as Chinese is yummy! It is just near to my place and I pop in every now and then... :)

I have fond memories of sharing rolls with my classmates from school and college from this place - of watching movies and eating rolls afterwards, and this place makes a very good chicken roll and egg chicken roll. The paratha is amazing, its crisp and tasty, and has a great filling-to-paratha balance. I have also tasted their fried items  a couple of times, and they make a nice fish fry. However, I have to say, they are very crowded, especially after a show gets over - and then you might have to wait a long time. But otherwise, a good roll joint for me.

Near Jaya Cinema, this fast food joint is so popular that when we feel like bringing something home from here, we have to calculate the time it will take. You will have to give the order and stand their after 5-6 (even 10) people most of the time. But it's worth it. I've had their chicken roll, egg roll, chicken chow, mixed fried rice, fish fry, chicken pakoras, veg momo, and chicken momo. None of these were disappointing. In fact, they were extra-delicious. I'm especially a fan of their chicken roll and chicken momo. The service is nice and the people at the cash counter knows how to behave with their customers.

This is the best fast food joint near Jaya cinema.

First of all a very big Thumbs Up for the location at the place. This is mainly a Chinese and roll take away joint bang opposite Jaya Cinema. The only way you can judge a roll shop is by ho many people are waiting for rolls . Even on week days this place is bustling  with crowd. 

Before the advent of the Multiples, Us lesser mortals of Salt lake had only Jaya to watch movies. Since Jaya was a 20 minute walk from my house i have seen many movies here . I have actually seen this shop open right in from of me. The rolls are brilliant and as is the Hakka chow and the chili chicken . They also make fairly decent fish fry . And the best part is the pricing . Its absolutely pocket friendly. 

The service is fast and the rolls are delicious .

Be it a movie at Jaya cinema hall.. or looking for shoe/bag at Khadims.. or just passing by Laketown.. I always try to visit Kings Grill.. Not because it is close to my home.. but because it has been consistently serving good food.. that too at a reasonable price!

Earlier it used to be a Roll joint... & the largest part of the visitors still crowd for their roll only! I am personally very fond of their rolls.. Be it chicken or chicken egg or just an egg roll.. you dont need to worry about the quality! The paratha they make is extremely crunchy and they do not put sauce in their chicken roll which that makes it more tasty!

I have also tried their momos.. both steamed and fried.. they are good.. specially the sauce.. But yes, it used to be better few years back!

Other items from main course which they serve are good.. both in terms of taste and quantity.. They make nice chicken fried rice..  less greasy.. full of chicken pieces.. Also the Chilli Chicken.. tasty.. From the Indian part, I have tasted only Chicken Kasha.. which is good.. but a bit too oily to my taste..

The biggest negative here is, serving time.. I had once waited for 45minutes to get two chicken rolls... not that the workers are slow.. but manpower needs to be increased, immediately.. 
Also, they dont give home delivery.. They could have made a good business out of it as Kings Grill is a quite popular name amongst Laketown residents...

Kings grill is a small road side roll counter that started serving chinese and indian preparations also. Its located opposite jaya cinema in lake town and is a very worth place for takeaway chinese food since they dont deliver. I do not get many oppurtunities to visit lake town but whenever i do, i try to make room for a kings grill. 

I find the rolls pretty average, nothing spectacular. The chinese dishes are good but what makes them great is the generous serving and reasonable prices !! Fried rice deserves a spcl mention and is not by any means of roadside quality. Noodles are decent, vegetables are good. Starters are not so much upto the mark and i tend to skip them. I haven't tried their indian menu yet and thats not on the near agenda either.

I would not bank on their rolls, starters but a plate of garlic fried rice and any of their vegetable in hot garlic sauce costing around 140 works for me big time anytime !!!

kings grill is a king with street side chinese food
the qty is good and the tasty. But being a street side food corner is lacks proper sitting arrangements .....moreover its always very very crowd .....and lacks a clean kitchen area...
overall a perfect junk food corner .........!!!!
