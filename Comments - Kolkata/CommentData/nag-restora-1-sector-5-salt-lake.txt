Taste was good but bit expensive when compared to quantity. Ordered veg south combo. Packing was good but delivery was bad. They took more time to delivery than expected.

The food reached me well before time. The food was okay and enough quantity for one person. The chicken was well cooked. The packing was done with tapes. Overall good food. I ordered for a Chinese Chicken Combo.

Ordered south indian combo through swiggy.... Everything from packaging to food quality to taste was awesome. The platter had one mini dosa, 1 mini uttapam , 1 idly , 1 vara, chattney and sambar.. The food was so fresh and hot.. The uttapam was the best... The plate costs you just 120.. Only thing I did not like was the vara which was fried in a oil used for non veg fries.. It smells so bad... Rest the food arrived in just 30 mins to new town. .. Overall a thumbs up....
