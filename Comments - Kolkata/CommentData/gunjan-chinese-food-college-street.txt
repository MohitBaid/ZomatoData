If you are looking for good Chinese food in a less budget you can choose Gunjan. A little food joint which can accommodate around 10 people. We ordered for chicken fried rice along with chicken manchurian and schezwan pork.I found the fried rice quite salty but enough amount for two people.Then the chicken manchurian was great. 6 meatballs were there but the gravy was less in amount. Pork schezwan was very bland to me, I was looking for some spicy kick.But it was absent. But meat was very succulent. Overall it's a good choice for college students.

If you want to have delicious Chinese without burning a hole in your pocket, this is the place to go. Situated in Surya Sen street about 5 minutes from Presidency University, it used to be a regular hangout joint on my undergrad days. Do try the Dry Chilli Pork and the American Chopsuey. I really like the quantity of the portions and how fresh the meat is every time.

Gunjan Chinese Food has always been a very wise choice for them who love their food in a peaceful ambience. A worthy and cost effective chinese restaurant to satisfy your hunger. But the place is a bit small as not everyone will find this as a cosy one. But it is always a paradise for the lover of Chinese and Tibetan cuisines. They serve quality food and if you ever visit the place, try their pork cuisines and the special chowmein they offer. The chow contains egg, chicken, prawn and pork. I love visiting this place.

A small chinese eatery located in college street, Gunjan is one of the best pocket friendly restaurant serving
 delicious chinese food at minimal cost. Their half plate portions are even good enough for a heavy-eater person. 
Decor is shabby yet clean with a maximum sitting capacity of 7-9 people. 

Went here with a friend and ordered one half plate Mixed noodles and one half plate chicken rice along with the 
side dish Hong kong chicken. Quantity of the noodles and rice was huge even after taking half plate portions. Hong kong chicken went well with the noodles and rice. 
Definitely recommended.

Well this place is a correct definition of big things come in small packages.
Stationed at surya sen street(college street), this miniature joint serves amazing set of chinese dishes which undoubtedly can set you lip smacking. The dishes from this kitchen can seriously take your taste buds to an amazing ride.
Well this can partially be called as a meat lovers den rather pork lovers den.
Came down to this joint a couple of times.
I tried:
Mixed Fried rice : One of the best i had with proper portions.
Roasted Chilli Pork : This is an absolute live here. The pork is so very tender, it just melts in your mouth.
Sweet Chilli Wings : An amazing the best dishes here, this dish can really set you drooling. Tossed in an amazing sweet schezuan sause gives you a perfect chilli tangy feeling.
Manchow soup: Thick broth perfectly aromatic filled with bundles of chicken and egg. Tastes amazing.
For me the Roasted Chilli Pork and the Sweet Chilli Wings are the star performers here.
The place would merely look as an unrated one but its when you have a dishe from this joint the amaze hits you.
So if you have a bunch looking for some great chinese food in extremely cheap prices you should be headed to this place right away.
I would recommend a visit to this place by 6 pm maximum otherwise some dishes start to exhaust.
This place keeps being filled all day long since it can fit around 10 people at a time.
I would definitely recommend this place for all.
This place definetly gets a ' Must visit' from me.

Gunjan is a small Chinese roadside eatery near College Street. The place looks quite shabby and there's no AC as well, but the food is of top notch. .

The Mixed Hakka Noodles came in good quantity with generous portions of egg, chicken, prawn and pork. It tasted good. 

The Roast Chilly Pork had  juicy pork meat tossed with chillies, onions and bell peppers. The meat was tender, and the quantity ( half plate ) was definitely impressive. 

The Hot Garlic Pork had large chunks of pork in a mild spicy gravy. The gravy tasted out of the world. The quantity of this dish was equally good, considering it to be a half plate. .

The entire bill came to just INR 290 😀

This place a hidden gem and a must visit for all pork lovers in the city !

Gunjan is an old little eatery serving simple chinese delicacies at affordable prices. Located near Kalika this is a 10 seater outlet. You would mostly observe people waiting outside the eatery for their tables, so it is advisable to pack your food.

Anyways i had the following:-

1. Chicken friedrice - I availed a full plate of it. The quantity was just right to suffice a heavy eater. The friedrice had a very rustic yet a very heart warming taste. The rice had generous amounts of egg,chicken shreds & chopped vegetables. Really liked it.

2. Chilli pork dry - I availed a half plate of it to compliment it with my staple. The quantity was decent for half plate with good amount of chillies,capsicums & onions. The pork had no fat but pure meat chunks. The taste was on point as it should be. However the only thing i disliked about the dish was that some pieces of pork had cartilage in it which was certainly discomforting for me to consume.

The pocket pinch is on the lower side with no GST being levied. The service is well so-so since water wont be served unless you demand for it & also they incorrectly gave me a normal chicken friedrice instead of my original order of schezwan rice. So there exists a miscommunication between the counter & kitchen staff which could be improved.

You will curse the reviewer after seeing the restaurant and probably drive back to your manual restaurant for another course. But trust me, after going into there you will be a fan of the light taste of chinese. Ok.. I am not saying it is the best of kolkata, but it can be said that it is good enough because of its pocket-pinch too. 
It is a very small food joint. This place even will be difficult to notice and it is a few minutes walk from Putiram.
We tried egg rice noodles and hong kong chicken. The chicken was soft, not so much filled with spices but very much useful tasted with selected spices. The rice noodles was according to me a bit over-fried but it was tasty enough. And the another thing is that their half plate is almost equal to full plate in other restaurants.
Overall you can easily try out some dishes here once to enjoy the lightness of chinese.

Your savior with hearty chinese food when you're really on a tight budget. 
The place is really small and crammy with hardly a sitting for more than 7-8 people, but that doesn't stop people from lining up for the food outside the joint. 
This place is all about the food and the delightful portions at surprisingly less prices. The pork dishes are something that gets this place it's fame and if you're craving for some good chilly pork, may be travel all the way to college and walk into the tiny alley where this place is located after getting lost a hundred times in the bylanes and it'd still be all worgh it!

Went here today for a quick snack. This joint is very small but clean. Me and my friends ordered half plate chicken friedrice. The amount was sufficient for a medium eater and the rice had a good amount of chicken and egg pieces. The service was quick and the staff were polite. The only downside is the less number of chairs. Other than that, satisfied.

Gunjan is not the place which will attract you at the first go. It is an extremely small food joint located at one side(read corner) of the Surya Sen Street. This place will be difficult to notice and is a few metres walk from Putiram. The place can hold a maximum of 10 people at one time. With a chinese latern and almost worn out tables and chair. this place offers more than one thinks. It provides one of the best quality of chinese food in the College street area. It is the perfect eating joint for a college goer with limited pocket money and great food quality. We had ordered Pork Manchurian, Roast chilli pork, Vegetable Fried rice, Chopsuey and Chicken Fried Rice. The pork was cooked to perfection and we liked it the best. Surely coming back for more.

Seating arrangement is for 10 people max.
Very fast moving joint. Service is too jet-speedy.
Not a hygienic place definitely.

1.Chicken fried rice is authentic (you won't need a side dish with this) with good quantity of both chicken and egg.
2.Dry chilli chicken and dry chilli pork are also a must try.
3.Mixed gravy chowmein and Manchow soup was completely tasteless. Couldn't even gulp a quarter of what was served.
Half plates are enough to fill your tummy!

We had Chicken Maifoon, Chili Pork, and Chicken Hot Garlic.

I saw this place on zomato and thought to give a try at this place as the price is very pocket friendly for students like us. I ordered half chilli chicken garlick chow and half chilli roasted pork. The best thing about this restaurant is they only took 5-10 minutes to serve their food. The ambiance was average. The food arrived and it looked good. But what left me in confusion is that the chicken chow didn't have any chicken in it,absolutely no chicken . The chow was also nothing special but the quantity was sufficient for a person. The pork item compensated for the chow as it was very delicious. Overall a nice place and I would have given this place a 3.5 rating if only I had chicken in my chicken chowmin.

Extremely economical. Their half plate is almost equivalent to full plates of other shops. Asked for mixed gravy chow they gave chicken gravy. But that's okay as it was good. Had Hong Kong chicken which was also good but a bit spicy. Very small shop and that is the only big demerit. They have 3 small tables so any 4th party coming has to wait outside. Overall an extremely pocket friendly shop. Plus they serve within minutes.

It's a very small and old restaurant in the beginning of a lane off Surya Sen Street. Ten people of average health will struggle to fit into the small chairs and sofa. Not for family dining or a date. Best suited for college students with limited budget and for takeaway.

There is barely decor with four Chinese lamps hanging from the ceiling. It is an open type of a place like a tea shop, with no window or door at the road side. It appeared to be owned by a middle-aged Chinese gentleman called Michael who sat outside.

I am interested in budget Chinese eateries which serve good food. I read the reviews here and wanted to try it out.

I came in the evening and wanted to try its pork as I had read recommendations of its pork dishes. But unfortunately, the pork meat left in the kitchen had too much of fat to serve and the kitchen stuff honestly mentioned it. I found the manager a bit rude. I wanted to change my order of half Roast Chilli Pork (dry) to something else and a fish dish would take time. The manager changed it to dry Chilli Chicken without asking me probably as that would be prepared fast. I had ordered half Egg Noodles along with the pork.

The service didn't take long. The noodles was ordinary; frankly speaking, it was street quality. I did not feel a Chinese flavour. It was served on a steel plate of appropriate size. The dry Chilli Chicken was good. It had six small pieces of chicken with no corn flour coating. The chicken was not chewy. Only some capsicum was missing.

The portion size is a plus point of this eatery. A half portion is filling if the appetite is not big. So the order should be accordingly given. It translates to value for money.

I would like to come back for the pork and the Cantonese staple.

You can easily get in here by using GPS. This is a small foodjoint with a facility of serving 8-10people maximum at rush hours. If you are a bit nickpicky about ambiance then i would suggest you To go for take away. But as people say sometime big things come in small packages, this place serves lipsmaking pork dishes at affordable price. They have simple decorations, not so comfy seating arrangements but i can bet their taste will make you forget all those insignificant imperfections.

When it comes about College Street, ‘Boi Para’ you will get thousands of different choices of books according to your taste and when it comes about food, the place is not so far behind than other places. You will get different types of food in every lane here, whither it is any quick bite item or any Chinese or South Indian item. Among all of them, Gunjan Chinese Food is such an over rated restaurant, where you can go with lots of expectation and get disappoint.

Been there few months ago with my foodie friend

This restaurant is located on the mouth of the next alley to paramount. This is a really old place. Sitting is very limited as it's a tiny restaurant. But the interior being small and average is very welcoming. If you like old North kolkata moods,you'll love it. Food was nice,and the good thing for small portion eaters like me is that they provide half plates,that's a win win for me. But when served we saw that half plate was equal to a full plate quantity,woah!😛. Anyways,its very pocket friendly. Loved the experience!!❤

A very small eatery.. Not comfortable.. But the food was great.. I had half mixed fried rice which was more than enough for me.. Quality and taste both were good..It had lots of chicken and prawn pieces, not at all oily but well cooked..the chiilli roast pork that i ordered for sides was also good.. It had enough small slices of pork and fat for half a plate.. Again the quantity was more than enough for me..The bill was only 140 bucks.. Very cheap and good food with good quality and quantity.. Definitely going back again.

Quality = 3.5 / 5
Quantity = 3.5 / 5
Decoration = 2.5 / 5

I rate this restaurant 3 / 5.. Because the dining room is for hardly 10 people to dine .. And the most disgusting one is there is no separation between the kitchen and the dining room, so the smoke ad smell of food pollutes the air within the whole place and creates problems for visitors.. 

Though the place is not well decorated, they serve delicious dishes.. Not so much oily or spicy.. Price is pocket friendly.. If u look for a budget lunch or dinner in chiense dishes, u can try this one.. This restaurant is just a 5min walk from Presidency University .. 

Now come to the point ~ food.. We ordered 1plate full chicken hakka chowmin, 1plate chicken fried rice, half plate chili chicken (B/L), half plate szechuan pork.. Chowmin and fried rice was good as well as in quantity and quality.. Chili chicken was normal.. And pork tasted good at first.. But the gravy was not tasty.. But it costs 355/- only..

A brilliant place in North Calcutta lanes to taste Chinese food. The quantity here is quite satisfying and the food is reasonably priced, a pocket friendly joint for students. I personally love the pork they serve here, leaving a distinctive taste in the mouth. The place in itself lacks fancy decor and people crunch in to fit but all these fade away once your order arrives here :)

It was a Saturday Evening I had no plans was getting bored and was feeling hungry at the same time. Then Zomato came to rescue it showed me that this restaurant was trending. I never had heard about it so I looked up for the location and suprisingly it was just 1.5kms aways from my place. I read d reviews it was decent and then I checked the menu after seeing the menu my love for Chinese and my hunger led me towards this restaurant. 
It's is quite a small restaurant hardy it has a seating capacity of 10 people. But luckily I got a place I without making any further delays ordered half plate chicken Manchurian and half special Cantonese noodles (the difference between the special and the mixed one is only the former one also contains pork along with chicken,egg and prawn). I wanted to have the prawn Manchurian but they told me they don't have any prawn side dish available.
The food was good better than what u find at any roadside joint definitely n the portions were quite large seriously I couldn't finish half plate. 
If u ever visit this place pls don't go alone the quantity they is quite large in portion.
P.S. I was in a hurry my bill amount was 150rs I by mistake gave the cashier 170 rs n was about to leave the place he called me from behind and returned me the extra 20 bucks. This was really the highlight of my visit. Would definitely visit again. :)

Don't judge the place by its look (small restaurant run by Chinese people). If you run out of money after buying books in college Street , and want good meal with minimum 💰 , this is the place. Hardly 10-12 people can seat here. Here half plate meal means enough for one person . Me and my friends had roasted chili pork (must try) , schezwan chicken fried rice , chicken rice noodles , chili mushroom (must try ) , Hong Kong chicken and chicken chili garlic noodles (all half plate) . We were so full that we couldn't even drink water 😆 good taste . If you're in college Street , must go then.

Gunjan is located at Surya Sen street which is the hub for the students of the nearby colleges and university. Don't judgr the place by it's shabby appearence. I have nothing to talk about the ambience or decor over here. Even the seating arrangement is very poor. But the food will surely melt your heart. Having so much of good chinese at this rate is quite unbelievable. Specially the fried rice they serve is great.

Don't judge a book by it's cover. The eatary may be small. Hardly 10 people can accommodate together. But the it is the best Chinese cuisine in college Street area. I've tried every dish there. It is actually very pocket-friendly. Once we used to there to celebrate birthdays when we were in college. Chicken chow mein and chicken Manchurian is there speciality. Service is good. So as the ambience.

'Gunjan' is a very small shop serving chinese dishes. It's pocket friendly eatery for all food lovers.
Many a times I have had my lunch, dinner from Gunjan( I took home). Its was my father who took me there for the first time. I've never been disappointed or dissatisfied with their food or anything.

Being a chinese lover I am overwhelming impressed by their serves. If you love pork definitely visit the place. The quality and quantity of food is very good. I love this place and their pork recipies. The pork recipies are lip smacking. I even liked their chilli fish. They provide us with the option of half plate and full plate which I appreciate.

My favourites are CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES, ROASTED CHILLI PORK(they serve both dry and with gravy).
I love this eatery, it's prices are very reasonable. The outlet is small but if are looking forward to having a perfect meal(chinese cuisine) this is it!
Highly recommend! Enjoy!

The food is affordable and delicious. If you're looking for tasty Chinese food this is the place to be. It is a hole in the wall restaurant, with enough room to seat a maximum of 10 people, however the food is definitely worth it. Their roast chilli pork, their special rice noodles, and their special chicken wings are my favorites. It is the perfect spot for collegiates with a budget.

A good place to discover.
I'm a bit uncannily obsessed with Gunjan. I like it very much....its pork to be specific.
A small Chinese restaurant, 10 seats total, on a road off-shooting from Surya Sen street, it's a place you can easily miss if you don't know. Very low cost restaurant...Yeah, "very" low cost.
Small place, not decorated (except some paper lights), service is fast, staffs are quite good.
About food , I like the Schezwan fried rice & dry roasted chilli pork very much,, and usually I order these two dishes whenever I go. Also soups are available at extremely low cost... Veg & chicken hot-n-sour soups are my favourites. Also they make good chicken wings & average chowmin.
I really DON'T think ordering chicken items ( except chicken wings) or rice noodle is a good idea.
Dry roasted chilli pork is the food that makes this place special...
I was quite worried about its hygiene initially...But I have been there many times, not once I fell ill.
If you want good food at a very low cost, this is a good place then​. I think they should enlarge their restaurant. With

This is one of the most underrated restaurants in the city. By the looks of it, it will hardly pass off as a decent place to eat. But you'd be making a mistake if you judge this place by its shabby appearance and tiny dining space.
Located in College Street, this place offers the best chinese and thai food at a surprisingly affordable price. Being a local, I have dined at this place and taken parcels innumerable times over the years. Their fried rice (egg, chicken and mixed), chilli chicken (12 pieces in full plate for about Rs. 130), hakka and gravy noodles are my top recommendations. The sheer quantity they serve for such cheap prices more than justifies the bill. To make it even better, they do not charge any taxes. The only down-side is that this place wraps up by 9-9:15 pm.
Overall, this place is an absolute saviour when it comes to overeating and paying peanuts in return. 2 people will struggle to finish the food within a budget of Rs. 250

Gunjan Chinese Food is the hub of low price Chinese items in College Street. This is a very small restaurant with seating capacity of 6-8 person at max. But when it comes to food their quality is good enough to make you like this place. This place is much popular among students and people looking pocket friendly food.
I have tasted almost everything here. Their Chowmine Rice every item is good. Gunjan Special Chowmine worths mentioning as it's really good. Try their Chicken wings, this is one of their highest selling item. Other then this Schewan Chicken, Schewan Vegetables, Garlic Chicken are few of their best I have tried.
And yes they have half plate options for each dish and a half plate is going to fill your appetite well.

This is a really tiny joint located near Surya sen Street! Being a student of Calcutta University now, I'm well acquainted to the lanes and by-lanes of College.

So one hungry afternoon I checked zomato and discovered this gem of a place - Gunjan!
The interior is nothing to speak of. Just 3 tables and a few chairs.
Frankly nobody cares after the food is served to you.

Having heard good things about their roast pork, we decided to give it a shot and my oh my! It was amazing to say the least. We chose mixed hakka chow as our saviour and yes, it was so! With generous portions of chicken, shrimps and pork, this was delicious!

The quantity is great! One full plate can be shared between 2! Now coming to the best deal, the price. It cost us (my friend and me) only 295 bucks for this hearty meal.

Definitely visiting Gunjan again.

I never dine in a place where pork is served alongside but this was an exception as because at the time of visit I was not aware of the fact that they served pork too. As queer it may sound, I did not even glanced at the menu and ordered for a Chicken Chow instantly.

It is located in just  the intersection of Surya Sen Street and Kanai Dhar Lane. It is a small eatery with seating arrangement for five to six people.

The chow was delivered quite fast and I even liked having it. But, after being aware of the fact, here on Zomato; I would not visit there again.

Located in a by lane, quite a few minutes walk away from college Square, the food is fresh, cheap and fast moving. It is a good place but a tiny joint - an eat and go kind of place. The owner used to be a Chinese. Perhaps he still is. That's the secret of the taste bud tickling Chinese dishes.

But then,the food they provide in such cheap rates without even compromising with the quality and quantity in today's financial hike is worth the praise. A half plate course is hard to finish all alone. It's undoubtedly one of my first choices when I am broke but desperately want to eat out. 
Just that,if they could provide more meat in place of those liver in pork preparations.

I have had the gunjan special rice noodles which was really value for money. it had shrimps, chicken, egg and pork.  Their famous roasted chili pork is a must try! It is roasted absolutely to perfection and yet it is so juicy! The sweet and spicy chicken wings is also something that is recommended. Gunjan has become my favourite haunt after i discovered it a month back and i would like to recommend it to all the foodies out there.

Gunjan is a tiny and cheap priced Chinese restaurant, with max seating arrangements of 10-12 people. Defying the odds of a small place, the food tastes like wow. An everyday go to place for college students. The service is too good and they have a big heart. If somehow extra fats get added to the food and the customer complains, they immediately change it without any delay. The night view is so romantic with dim lit Chinese lanterns hanging from above. Great place to have pork dishes especially roasted chilly pork. Other dishes are also good. Would love if it expands.

Studying in College Street has had its fair share of perks, and Gunjan happens to top the list for me! I discovered this place on a rather desultory day, with a classmate with whom I shared a love for pork. She took me to this tiny little restaurant through the cramped lanes of Surya Sen Street and, lo and behold! - I found love! The food is very generously served for the price that one pays for it and you will not leave dissatisfied. My all-time favourite is the chili pork with pork schezwan fried rice. You may have to wait for a bit under the ruthless Calcutta sun and sweat it out while a table gets cleared inside, but it will be worth the wait and every paisa of your money. Maybe it's the food loving soul inside me saying these things or maybe it's the student-budgeted mind - it won't matter once you've visited. 

Long live, Gunjan!

This is the best and most affordable place in College Street for Chinese dishes. Gunjan an extremely small Chinese restaurant in Surya Sen Street.
I often visit this place to have Chowmine which they make amazingly tasty. The Chicken dishes are also very good. Recently they have started giving offer on Chicken Wings Sweet and Sour at Rs.130 a full plate, and believe me, if it would have cost Rs.200 its still worthy to purchase, as they make it so well.
I am going to this place from last four years and they have not compromised with the quality yet. And prices are cheap too. Costs around Rs.500 for 4 people just!!!
If you are in College Street looking for Chinese dishes, Gunjan is there for you.

I explored this place for the first time after having bhang with my friend. Although i barely gulped down the food that afternoon i really liked the taste and came back next day in the evening for the chilly pork. The chilly fried pork and the pork noodles are my favourite combo in this resturant. The old guy in the counter along with the small but nicely built cabin style resturant with a small hint of china really struck me. And this is one of my favourite places for having pork. The chilly chicken is also decent but it lacked favour and the spice punch.

Although I have been visiting college street on a regular basis for the last 4 years , i came to know about this place only a couple o months back (thanx to Zomato). I went here twice and both the times i had chilli garlic noodles, which was pretty decent. Among the side dishes i had roast chilli pork dry and chilli chicken which was also quite good. The place is very small only 3tables and has sitting arrangements for only 10 people. Practically no ambience at all. But the plus point is that it is pocket friendly and hence ideal for students. Will definitely visit again to try some other dishes.

Tucked away in a tiny lane just off Surya Sen Street, Gunjan Chinese Food is a Chinese eatery that has quite a unique and intersting decor compared to other places of this type. A dimly lit, albeit cramped seating area (seats just aorund 10 people) decorated with paper lights that hang above the tables, the place is quite inviting if you are alone and longing for some Chinese. But the food is not impressive. I ordered a Chicken Chowmein and Chilli Chicken .While the chowmein was strictly okay, the Chilli Chicken that more batter than chicken and worse, the batter was quite eggy which threw the whole dish. Service is quick and the dishes are quite reasonably priced. Might be a good place to visit for Chinese on a very-low budget.

I came across this joint so many times but never gave it a try. After learning from zomato that it makes some nice pork dishes, I visited it.
Located at Surya sen Street, near to kalika. Small food joint with sitting capacity of 6 to 8 people. Neither the decoration, nor the ambience is impressive. But they really makes some delicious pork dishes, particularly ROASTED CHILLI PORK. Price is very cheap considering quality and quantity. Rice items are not up to the mark. I prefer this place only to take away the pork dishes.
Owner should look into the cleanliness of the kitchen. It's congested and unhygienic.

The low budget restaurant for authentic Chinese food... Situated at Surya Sen street this is a place with old Kolkata flavor... Pandal hopping at college street and then eating at Gunjan is not a bad idea. You should visit here once for their pork dishes... I have tried special rice noodles(pork, egg, chicken, prawn), chicken chop sue, chicken chowmin which are good in taste..

Come here for the pork dishes. The pork are well carved and made into some lipsmacking items. I usually do not try any other item here, may be except the rice. This place is often frequented by the college go-ers as the price of the items is quite cheap..

Ok so I have been studying I  Presidency University for 4 years now and it is only recently that I discovered this place.
I mean can you believe it?Had I known this place before it would have saved me so much money and made my tummy so much happy because it is the cheapest and one of the most delicious Chinese eateries I know. 
The seating arrangement is super small ,cam accommodate only 10 people ,15 of you really manage to squeeze in. But the food. My God their food is delicious! 
Try their schezwan rice and thank me later!:)

My rating solely depends on the quality and quantity of their food...its a tiny little restaurant...near college square opposite kalika...till now i have tried their hong kong chicken and chow and fried rice...i am yet to try their pork dishes..which seems to be their speciality...the chicken and noodles as well as rice was good to taste...it had just the right amount of spices in it...the prices are also quite pocket friendly...its moreover a perfect place for students.. Or people with a tight budget :)

A very nice place to have Chinese when you're short on cash. Do try the pork dishes over there. They're cheap, and tasty! The place is just too small and that is exactly why we opted for takeaway. 

In a nutshell, the food is quite good for the price they charge and I'd definitely visit this place again to try the other pork dishes.

If you are a college goer, want to have chinese food (better than the road side stalls) every now and then, a porkaholic and a big-eater this is the place for you.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE their pork. I never spend money on chicken, fish or prawn dishes here.
The dishes under the garlic chow category are simply awesome (although you may feel there is a little excess oil in it)
The noodle soup is very light and a bowl is enough for lunch even for the super hungry souls.
The quantity provided even in half-plates are huge.
Service is prompt.
Only 10 people can sit inside the place and often you have to wait outside for sometime before you get a place.

My pick from the place- mixed/pork garlic chow and dry chilli pork

College Street is a place for bookaholics but with lots of food counters its a lovers point for foodies too. Gunjan Chinese Food is a over hyped Chinese food counter where you may go by following its higher rating but you probably be disappointed too.

Location : This place is very easy to locate at Suriya Sen Street just to the corner of the lane. Its near to the very famous chop shop Kalika & the nearest metro station is Central.

Decorations : With maximum of 10 sitings available the restaurant is very small & available crowds at the time of evening may make you wait a bit to get a sit over there. Its a non AC cabin but the sittings are comfortable than you expect. The Chinese elegant lightings make the ambience really good. Overall looks clean & hygienic.

Staffs : Being in a small place the staffs response fast & they also serve you fast. Not only that the guys can even explain you their foods & recommend you too.

Foods : When my hungry friend Akash left half of his chowmeing unfinished then I became sure about their quality of the foods.

Egg Hakka Chow : The chowmein was very thick & very less vegetables were used with it. Very lite spices were there but well mixed. The eggs were not mixed well. Overall it tasted not that good as I expected from here.

Egg Gravy Chow : In case of Gravy Chowmein the same quality of chowmein were used. The gravy was not very thick & tasted very off. Even here also very less vegetables were used. Appropriate spices were not present so it tasted very bad to me. You may need to add lots of sauce & paper to gulp this.

Egg Sichuan Fried Rice : The rice looked pretty light with small diced vegetables in it & the light color of it. The rice used were of local very low grade quality therefore as expected neither it tasted good nor it smells. There wasn't any taste of the rice, the single taste that was visible of chilli powder & it was making the dish too hot.

Chilli Chicken : The half plate offers 6 pieces of chicken. The boneless chicken pieces were very small & not at all well cooked. The taste of spices were not coming from the chicken. There was only green chillies & very small amount of onions & it completely missed the capsicums. The gravy was completely tasteless actually better to say it tasted like water was mixed with soya sauce only. Gravy was very thin & not preferable with other dishes. The over rich garlic smell coming from the dish disappointed me a lot.

Pricing : The menu card prices seems very affordable & especially when they don't even make you pay to the govt it can be a good choice for some kind of people. Unfortunately considering the quality of the food I will not be counted as those kind of persons. It was absolute not a value for money deal for me at all.

Conclusion : In my opinion the pathetic odd food quality of this place can be compromised for any others restaurants located at the same locality. Where I didn't found anything special over here still the crowd especially at the time of evening proves the popularity of this restaurant.

This is a much overhyped restaurant. After my five years in College Street, I had visited this place today for the first time. The food was the thing that was much praised in the reviews. But I was rather disappointed. Firstly, we ordered for three full plates of Mixed Chilli Garlic Chow for five people as the person at the cash counter said that this would be enough. When served, we noticed that the quantity was not sufficient, so we ordered for two extra plates, one for each. The noodles were not flavoured perfectly with the chilli garlic sauce. This is what it lacked. Besides, we also ordered a plate of Mixed Schezwan Rice and two plates of Roast Pork Chilli. The rice was good, quantity was sufficient and the pork was tasty too. But I think the portions they serve do not have any uniformity and they are not sufficient as they claim to be. There was a very sweet old person, probably from the hills, who served us, filled up the glasses when empty and took care of our belongings as they had to be kept outside the restaurant since it is a very small eating joint with seating arrangements for ten congested in a rather small place. Gunjan is a place where you can go to try Chinese food when on a budget and really not with very high expectations and hunger in your tummy. Happy Dining! :)

Starting off, This is probably the tiniest food joint in Kolkata.

We ordered a mixed chilli garlic chowmein and a hot garlic pork. The quantity of the chowmein was quite generous, but the pork quantity was average at best.

Taste wise, its good, but I felt it was overhyped a lot. Its a good enough place to eat sometimes, but not really what people have hyped it to be.

I should not say much about Gunjan as I have visited it only once and ordered only pork chowmin(hakka). My friend Arko Roy suggested me to give a visit in this tiny(probably tiniest in Kolkata) food joint in college Street area.AMBIANCE is a Chinese imposition. Food is above avarage but Not that 'Great'. Pork pieces were minced and the fats were sliced in the hakka noodles. While chiewing the fat slices were melting in the mouth,giving a perfect flavour of pork. Wish to visit another time for soups.

We two friends visited 14th September 2015 at around 2 pm. It has 10 seats only. Place is small, congested. We ordered 1 full shichuan rice mixed, half shichuan fish and half ginger chicken. We had to wait about 30 mins. But as we expected good food there, we were jst sitting there and enjoying the cosmopolitan essence of central kolkata happily. We started feeling bad whn they served orders of the customers who came later. Bt still didnt mind becuase we thought they might be regular customers. Bt then (after 20 mins of waiting) the owner(cum cook) told us tht fish nt available. We called again the waiter and told him to cancel fish and ginger chicken as well but provide full plate shichuan chicken. At last they served us with the rice first. We noticed tht the quantity was more or less same as the half plate (which they already served earlier to the latter customers). Then they served ginger chicken also tht was only half plate. We understood tht the waiter didnt tell to make full plate shichuan later. So i asked the waiter bt he was fumbling. At tht moment suddenly the owner cum cook yelled at us and misbehaved asking why we didnt tell  clearly at first.he didnt listen us bt asked wht extra item was required thn.we told tht those were all. This whole incident was very unfortunate in front of other customers.

 Now coming to hygiene : not good, like street stalls, utensils were not properly cleaned.

Quality of food : rice was shit. Chicken was okay considering the price.

Will never visit again.

I was introduced to this trove of Chinese food by a crazy bunch of over enthusiastic juniors in my university, during that phase when the best part of a day would be spent rehearsing for dance shows and competitions. This is a clean and tiny place with a few tables, chairs, sofas and a small kitchen at the back. Famished to the core, we seated ourselves and ordered for Veg Noodles and Chicken Manchurian. The food arrived and vanished in no time at all. While the Manchurian gravy was nothing great, the noodles were wholeheartedly yummy. 

On a more recent and sober visit with him, we tried the Roast Chili Pork and Chicken Noodles and oh they were delicious! We wanted the dry pork but were served with the gravy instead. The gravy I’ve found is not so commendable at this place but the rest are quite infallibly unswerving in its quality. The quantity also deserves a special mention, as half a plate of the chili pork was quite enough for two moderately hungry mortals. The pork was perfectly cooked and the noodles, though a bit oily, were nice and filling. 

Prices are absurdly low, service is always fast and the hospitality genuinely warm. No wonder people love this place, and so do we!

One of the most pocket friendly, value for money Chinese eating houses in Central Kolkata. Tailor made for school and college students here in College Street.
This place is not at all that big, which people would expect from an average restaurant. At most only 10 people can sit here at one go, in that case as well you will find this place as very congested. But if you're here only for tasty Chinese food with a very limited budget, this is the best place you can find. Quantity of food is enough for satisfying an average eater. Though the service is OK, but still it could be better; Deducted 0.5 point because of this only.

I just cannot stop myself from giving the review today itself. May be it is that I have become too generous while giving ratings to restaurants.  Or may be I believe this joint just serves amazing food. I was roaming in and around central area for long when I started looking for a cheap joint where I could just hog in some quality food. And there was gunjan chinese food in the college street area. Nonetheless without wasting much of time called them. They directed me proper directions. Now this located near college square. If you walk in from calcutta University taking surya sen street , this small joint is located on the third left. You are lucky if you can bag in a seat . This is a very small joint where people literally hurl in during the lunch hours. 
Pros : 1. the magic of micheal da's hands can make any bland good taste amazing (that's what people eating there were discussing). 
2. it is dirt cheap and more over half portions of all the dishes are available.  So small eaters can relish. 
3. The homely ambience of north kolkata relieves
4. The extrvagant food.

Cons: 1. There are no decorations except for one or two lanterns hanging.
2. Too small a place just five table which can hardly accomodate 10 people. Moreover it is not air conditioned. 

The next big thing about gunjan is . Amazing pork meat is available here and that is quite unexpected considering the ambience. So moral of the story : do not judge a book by its cover.

Since I wanted to start off soup went in for a chicken mushroom soup. The moment I tasted it, I was lost. The rich broth and stuffed with chicken mushroom and veggies.
Since I am much of a gravy noodles fan. It had to be cantonese mixed chowmein half and what else than roast chilli pork? It was served in no less than five minutes. The noodles was a bit low in salt so I would suggest you must go in for the fried rice. But the roast chilli pork was heavenly, ecstatic and I think it is comparable to the tibetian delite standards. The half portion was also immense and I was so filled till my neck.
And all these at just Rs. 175!!

Definitely this joint goes to one of my favourite chino food centre list along with tung naam, tibetian delite anf pou hing. I am sure I am dropping into gunjan too soon. 

P.S.: the rating 4 is solely on the quality of food they serve.

It is a very small joint located in a small goli so it maybe difficult to spot it the first time.. The service is quick and quality is unmatched..  Definitely worth a shot

Wonderful food..specially.Schzwan pork..it is the best on the menu..the chef has got magic in his hands.the food is of good quality and it is extremely pocket friendly...we could never complete half a plate rice or noodles..gunjan has ensured that we survive our university days...so basically hv tried everything...the quantity is still the same. Quality never falters..and ofcourse the spicy chicken wings (special item ) is the clear winner.

A very small eatery located at surya sen street in college street. If you expect a high class ambience this place is not for you. This small eatery has 3 tables and can accommodate maximum 11 people at a time.
Coming to food. Well they serve huge quantity at a very low price. We ordered mixed manchow soup which was good, though salt was little less. It had good amount of chicken, prawns and coriander.
Chicken fried rice- tasted ok.. Had lots of chicken. 
Garlic chicken (full)- it had 12 pcs of chicken. They were crispy and did not had a lot of cornflour. Though the gravy was a bit watery.
Service- food came in 10 mins.
Behaviour of the staffs were good. Pocket pinch was nominal as we had to pay Rs. 250 for our order.
Will surely visit when im near college street.

Unassuming in its appearance, Gunjan harbours one of the finest Chinese in the area. The queer little shack with a small attached kitchen brings to you tongue tickling flavours with fresh food and welcoming aroma, and leaves you with an urge to revisit for more. Price is reasonable and quantity in the plate is adequate. In spite of a low seating capacity, Gunjan always has customers coming in.

You wouldn't believe what this small eatery has in store. The first time I went there, was a bit sceptical. But I had my doubts negated after I tasted the food. After Chinease closed, Gunjan was the next stop for our chinese cravings. And they serve pork! 
As I said earlier, don't expect much in the ambience and decor department. Its a rather small and if I may say so, a little shabby. But the food makes up for it.

The restaurant is really tiny and the space is extremely cramped. The space hardly allows half a dozen people to sit and eat in reasonable comfort. The seats and tables are extremely small where even middle school kids will have a hard time fitting themselves. The entrance is nondescript and the restaurant lies in an equally nondescript bylane, so its very easy to miss it altogether.
Coming to the food, the prices are very low, the portions huge and it scores quite high on taste and deliciousness. In short, great value for money. So if you are extremely hungry, low on money and craving large amount of reasonably tasty Chinese food, this is the place to be. However, I would advise getting your food packed and eat it somewhere else because of the space constraints and the resulting overcrowding. Also I found the service to be slow and erratic.

A very tiny place for great Chinese food. If you're like me,and don't care about the decor if the food is superior, then this place is a MUST visit. Try the roast chilli pork and you'd be blown away at the quality it offers... also try the prawn dishes and noodles. Very pocket friendly and decent portions served.
Must try.

I like to wonder. I love this city. Kolkata always throws something in my way to surprise me and once again, I wonder. If one want to get wondered once again in this cosmopolitan wonderland should visit gunjan. For many like me it is michael bhai's (That fat chines man on the counter) place.

 How come such a place serves such great and authentic chines food? People with insight of chines community's evolution in kolkata might have the answer in their mind.  But again this place along with their delicious foods have that recipe of making you wonder.

This is a very decent place for your Chinese cravings when you are low on budget. 
This tiny restaurant seats 10 at the most and you may end up sharing tables with complete strangers but then again with the pricing of the menu we can hardly complain.
 Went with a friend and ordered a veg fried rice a garlic pork and a dry chilli pork. The portions were pretty generous and the fried rice was decent enough. The garlic pork was good though a bit too sweet. The chilli pork lacked flavour. The pork was soft and not overburdened with fat.
Cheers to pocket friendly pork! Nothing beats that!

My cousins used to tell me please have one plate of dry chilli chicken and you are bound to fall in love with this place. A very small place, which can hardly accommodate 10 people at a time I guess. Ambiance is not at all good, and my rating goes only for the food. I think home delivery is a better option for this place.
So when I was passing by this restaurant, my mom insisted me to have something because I was too hungry. I quickly ordered a dry chilly chicken and a gravy chowmein. Both were served in no time. And the taste, it was more than good that is being sold in well decorated restros. The chicken was perfectly cooked, not at all dry inside.Garnishing perfectly with fried onions did the wonders! The gravy chowmein was smooth enough not only in taste but also in colour and texture. And yes, it do contains a lot of fresh veggies with a perfectly thick gravy.
I think if you are thinking of some quick bites, it is worth a try!

This is a very small place to visit, only 10 people can sit comfortably. Truly it is a half roadside Chinese food corner with a few dishes. But surprisingly the taste is one of the best of its kind with such a very very low cost. The only thing I hate about the place is the bad temper of its owner and his irregularity. Otherwise it is a perfect place for college students.

This chinese dining place is tucked at one of the lanes beside suryasen st. and stone throw distance away from college st and kmc borough . Its a small place run by a north east person and a tireless and ever happy old man, who is very friendly and efficient. Although the place can accomodate 9 to 10 person at a time but you can always relish on their various chinese dishes including pork noodles,chilly pork and mushroom dishes. The prices are also very affordable and pocket friendly. They also offer sufficient quantity which is enough for 2 people.
 In a nutshell if you are not bothered about the place where you had meal then its a place where should visit if you come over college st.

The seating accommodation is the only fault of this joint otherwise than which it is a restaurant, despite not being very popular, has the capability of competing with the best in its category.  The cuisine is absolutely delectable. I would recommend the hakka mixed chow to every foodie, which indeed is the one dish I like the most. Moreover, all the delicious items there come for quite a cheap,  and I mean it, really cheap price, going by the standard rates charged by other Chinese restaurants. ....

This is my first time visit of it, and was astonished to see it's capacity. It was very small restaurant.
So, in 0 expectation I just ordered "chop sui"
When they serve it. It was smelled very nice, and well cooked! The gravy have perfect thickness. The chops were, very crunchy as well!
But, although not that huge taste... But considerably acceptable!

Gunjan is a little restaurant tucked away in one of the anonymous by-lanes of college street. My friends were really proud of themselves for having chanced upon this place, as it seems to be the only easy on the pocket Chinese restaurant. However, this place did not appeal to me when I went there for the first time as it was not very clean. There was very little place and it can only accommodate 12 people all at once. But when I tasted the chilly pork they make, I forgot all about my cleanliness issues. It was so so good to taste. The quantity that they give in a half plate order is more than enough for a person with an average appetite. the chilly chicken dry is mouth watering too. to sum up, Gunjan is worth one visit.

Gunjan is a short dull place at Surya Sen Street which is generally over crowded at any time of the day. The biggest and the most obvious reasons are due to its location advantage. Its just stone's throw away from the buzzing college street. The second reason is its very reasonable. 
Now comes the most important part that is the food. The food is yummy. But its bit rich. Their noodles is very oily. The portion is very good and thus suffices for a full grown. The side dishes are also good in portion. But I found their side dishes especially the chili chicken and garlic one to be tasteless. The Chinese feel was missing. Their Fried rice is decent. So If you are ardently finding any place near college street to serve your appetite quickly then this is the place at a pocket friendly price.

If you are not bothered about where you have your food as long as it satisfies your taste buds,then gunjan is the place to be. For Presidencians like us who were looking for an alternative cheap chinese food stall when the very favourite Chinis closed down,Gunjan emerged as a saviour. The best part here is that the food is cheap and they have options for Half or full portions..But the half portions of say a chicken dish contains 6 pieces of chicken..so a full portion of a dish is never ordered usually! 
Now coming to the food-this is almost authentic chinese and my personal favourites are the non veg Chilli garlic noodles and Chicken Szechwan fried rice. In face the rice here is so well cooked and flavoured you seldom require a side to accompany it. However if you decide to accompany your mains with sides take your pick from their chilli chicken dry(which could double up as a starter as well),hot garlic chicken or chicken mushroom veg(this one is less spicier,is packed with fresh veggies and mushrooms and albeit very good for your system). The pork dishes are very good as well(I find some people are a bit apprehensive about trying pork from small eateries,but trust me,you wont be disappointed here). You could take your pick from the roast pork chilli as your starter or pork mushroom veg as your mains(which like the chicken is packed with veggies and mushrooms). 
Finally,the best idea is to pack your food and have it in the comforts of your home and enjoy your date with a taste of China,without burning a hole in your pocket.

YUMMY CHINESE FOOD NEAR COLLEGE SQUARE!
3 out of 5

The food eatery called Gunjan Chinese Food can be another dining out option the next time you are in the College Street area. It definitely needs to be included in your long list of Chinese restaurants. The food prepared here is not only tasty but light on the pocket as well. The joint is a no frills kind of place. This is a very ordinary looking restaurant but they do provide comfortable sitting arrangements. The food is served without any delay and reaches you fresh and piping hot. The servers are not only friendly but efficient too. The Chinese food served is very simple and light.

Their soups are wonderfully made - from seasoning to flavours their soups do not falter in any department, though it is their pork noodle soup that is the winner of them all. The noodles are soft and thick with a sufficient amount of pork meat. The pork and the soup can drive away all your blues. But if you are looking for some hotness in your soup, their hot and sour soup and manchow soups are must try.  The soups are fiery without being overtly so.

Their meat dishes are the ones that you should look out for (sorry vegetarians, you should sit this one out!). Their meat pieces are juicy and tender. Even at half a plate, the amount of meat is enough for one person, especially people with really small appetites might find one dish difficult to demolish. Thus, dishes like chilli chicken, sweet and sour prawn, pork mushroom veg, roast chilli pork, and Manchurian fish should not be missed but tried one at a time if you are along or just two. They go very well with their chilli garlic Hakka chow items like pork chilli garlic chow, mixed chilli garlic chow and special chilli garlic chow. Even their fried rice dishes are well made.
