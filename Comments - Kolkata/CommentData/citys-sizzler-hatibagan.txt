Situated on Vivekananda road this is perhaps the only restaurant on the block, the others being near Hedua & Hatibagan area. Once it made really great food, but now the standard has fallen drastically. Paneer pasanda used to be an exquisite dish here, unfortunately today we felt it was below average taste. The paneer was rubbery, like it was cooked straight out from the refrigerator. The Chinese preparations were okay, garlic chicken tasted fine. The ambiance is nice with white marble furnitures and the service is prompt. Prices are reasonable too.

Nice ambience. I went there for having lunch with my friends. Pocket friendly dishes. Quality of foods is also good. The decoration is pleasing. But service could be more better.

One of the few restaurants in this place. It was a summer afternoon and I went with my friends for a quick lunch. We got a table on the first floor. 
We ordered Mixed sizzler, Hakka chicken chowmein, Sweet and sour chicken and Butter naan. 
Quantity they provide is optimum. The chicken preparation was really good and so was the Chowmein, the naan was also soft and tasty. About the sizzler, I felt, it could have been better. 
The restaurant is small and much difficult for large groups to fit in properly. But it's really pocket friendly. Service is prompt. I'd say it can be tried once for its Chinese dishes.

This is the worst kind of restaurant in which I had food ever in my life... Today, due to some time constraints I had to had lunch in this restaurant... I ordered biryani... And to my utter surprise, the biryani came without an ALU... For god's sake, which Kolkata Biryani, is cooked without an ALU... It is the main essence of Kolkata Biryani... When I asked the manager, he said that we cook biryani without ALU...Plus by its taste only I could make out, that it was a stale food... They charged me 180/- bucks for that damn thing... One advice, don't fool the customers on their hard earned money, because it is through your customers you get your salary as well...AND PLEASE GUYS NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE EVER IN YOUR LIFE... THESE GUYS SERVE STALE FOOD WHICH MAY LEAD TO HEALTH ISSUES... ALERT... DON'T EVER WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE CHEATERS...

The most advantageous feature of this place is that it faces no harsh competition because there is no other big restaurants near around. The food quality is fine but the prices are pretty cheap as there is no extra charge for tax

A budget friendly family dine joint with passable quality food. It's just adjacent to Vivekananda Road crossing hence quite easily accessible. The service is quite good but the area is too small. Still this place serves you good Chinese apart from budget friendly Sizzlers. If you are in College st or Hedua area, do pay a visit.

We planned to have a nice family lunch during the Durga Pujas and order in from this restaurant. We actually went through the trouble of selecting the menu the day before and ordering beforehand so that the restaurant could have a little headstart during this busy season. When we offered to collect the parcel ourselves we were assured that it would be delivered on time. However when the time came, we were called up thrice by three different people from the restaurant asking for our address and a final fourth call saying they can not deliver during the pujas. When we went to the restaurant to pick up the parcel we had to witness an incredible drama where the manager scolded his second in chief for accepting a home delivery order, the second in chief scolding the next in line for not having it ready and so ad infinitum. Not quite a set up for a nice peaceful family day. 
All things considered, the food was not bad (although the packing could be better). Being a large party we ordered a variety of dishes and they were all pretty good, more or less. The tandoori chicken was particularly good, though a tad dry. The chicken and mutton kasha was extremely delicious. The fish tikka was soft and tasty. We also liked the chilli paneer and the mixed vegetable. The only flop perhaps was the mutton biryani which had a little too much scented water in it. All in all, it was a good meal, unless you count the inconvenience at the beginning. The prices were very reasonable too.

The restaurant has a unique warmth in the ambiance. I would say the coziest place you would find in central Kolkata with great food !
Sizzlers are specialty of course, but one hidden specialty I would like to mention are their Soups !
I just love them ! Be it the Cream of Tomato or Sweet Corn Chicken Soup.
North Indian dishes are a bit on the sweeter side. You cannot expect north Indian dishes to be much spicy here.
On top of this, it would cost you only 600 bucks for two people on an average.
All in all one of those places where you would like to go out casually with your loved ones or friends.
Cons : They do not have Sizzlers on their Puja Menu, which is a bit disappointing for many people.
PS: This is my first review ever ! Never felt like reviewing any other restaurant before :P

City’s Sizzler is located a couple blocks from Vivekananda Road crossing towards College Street. This is a trivial restaurant which has been here for ages. The place is not much known about but it has been a regular dine in spot for the locals since its inception. I had been here some time back to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

The food is overall an average, as some items being quite good others might fail to appease you. The prices are somewhat high in terms of the food provided. The place is maintained and has some degree of hygienic level. The service tends to be bit slow, even though the restaurant isn’t that big.

Funny place as a strange smell hits u when u enter this place. They have only one veg sizzler option, the paneer sizzler which has paneer and some vegetables on a hot plate. The owner proudly announces that with sizzlers you have to order side dish of noodles or rice. We then opted for a combo available which the waiter proudly announced is very small in quantity and is better to order from the menu. At the end, a simple veg Hakka noodles was order which was decent in quantity and quality but for 156/- (inclusive of all taxes) is very expensive. I don't have the courage to visit this place again and won't recommend it to anyone.

They have deteriorated in the past few years. When we tried them earlier the sizzler used to be good if not great. Now what they serve are a plateful of tasteless veggies in a tasteless sauce with thick batter coated tasteless pieces of fish, chicken and prawns. The chicken was rubbery and tasteless. The fish was the best among the three and we could not get the taste of the prawns thanks to the thick batter.

Chinese is also pretty average. They used to make good Indian mutton dishes. Have not tried them recently, but hope they are atleast still good.

The only saving grace was the fresh lime soda.

Service is very slow. With the restaurant completely empty we had to wait for 20+ minutes for our food and remind them of the soda twice. The staff is well behaved though.

Price is on the higher side among other eateries around the area.

Will come back once more for the Indian mutton dishes. About the rest, avoid.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: The name City Sizzler seemed to me very interesting and classy till i went to this place. Located just near the Vivekanand crossing opposite of UBI Vivekanand branch. The outside of this resto  in the night time looks so silent but its fine in the day. Not so renowned place but still a good known place for many and the locals out there.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Not a very big resto but still enough sitting arrangement to have 60 to 70 people seated at a time. Provided with wooden table and chair entirely with very low light and simple interior. Resto is full AC but when there was lots of people in this place was seemed con justed. Staff are attentive but are very slow in the process of serving. Place is neat and clean.

FOOD: I specially went here for a anniversary party. So didn't had the opportunity to order myself. But only writing for what the experience i had with the food i had here. Beginning with Chicken sweet corn soup, Followed by tandoori chicken in the starter. In the Main course we had Chicken Reshmi butter masala, chilly chicken, garlic Chicken, Mixed Rice as well as Butter Nan.

Chicken Soup was fine but taste was very average. It was thick contained proper egg but chicken was a bit absent as well corns.

Tandoori Chicken was not satisfactory at all. Very ordinary looking, taste was also ordinary as well as when served it was cold.

Chicken butter Masala was somewhere fine with the taste and the gravy but disappointed with Chicken. Pieces were even smaller than a chicken pakora.

Chilly Chicken also seemed ordinary. Taste was just like any other, Nothing different. Gravy was thick.

Garlic chicken was good. When i had the chicken in my mouth it tasted just like Garlic chicken.

Mixed rice was JUST ABNORMAL i can say. The rice used was absolutely pathetic. When served in plate it looked so pale. Ingredients used were proper with egg chicken and prawn. Taste was very average.

Butter Nan was fine in taste shape and size.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food served here are very ordinary. As per my expectations and thoughts this is not what i expected. Quantity is also very poor in the process. Prices taken here are somewhere high according to the food they are providing. 

CONCLUSION: LOTS OF IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED IN FOOD.

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This restaurant is very near to my home but didn't visit there earlier. In this puja we, family visited this place and found this as a better option than cha cha hotel. Food quality is good and behaviour is moderate they should have more friendly. Overall its a good place for dinner.

Ambience - 6/10; Food taste - 8/10; Quantity - 8/10; Staff behavior - 9/10 Both indian and chinese food are good.
Even if you go during the pujas , when there is a huge rush, you would still find the food quality and quantity good. Have been visiting the place since 6years and had never a bad experience.

We went there. We were 15 people and within a moment the owner swept us away with his extremely polite behaviour. Arranged seats and took the order.services were good.Starters were nice and tasty.
The culprit was the main course. Sweet n sour chicken was so sweet that we probably don't need any sweet for the next few days. Schezwans were okay!Rice was so bad.The owner apologized for the sweet and sour chicken. Place was nice and the services were unexpectedly good which is a plus point. 
Verdict : yes,but with random choosing of food.

One of the worst experience over here. We reached here at 5:45 pm and the restaurant was clearly displaying the neon "Open" signage as shown in the photograph. They even guided us where to park my car as a customer of their restaurant. After entering, we found a snacks section in the menu which clearly mentions the time period as 4 to 7 pm. Now when we wanted to order for Chicken Pakora from that section itself, the person comes and says that it will not be available. Next, when enquired about what items will be available, they simply discussed for 2 minutes among themselves and mentioned that it was a mistake that they have mentioned that the restaurant was open, but actually it is closed and will open only after 6:30 pm, no items will be available as of now as they don't have sufficient staffs. Absolutely absurd to experience such a thing when we were welcomed and made to seat in the restaurant.

Earlier the food used to be of good quality but recently their standard deteriorated specially Chinese dishes now are not at all good they are oily but north indian is still good. Also salad variants are good, ambiance is very cozy and gives you a homely feeling. Staffs are very humble and helpful, all in all go if you feel hungry. Its only AC resturant in a wide range area so thats a good advantage of it. So its recommended.

I visited this place with my brothers some week back.. One of my brother who stays nearby this restaurant recommended it..
Ambience: The first thing attracted by attention was the ambience..Spacious, well decorated and classy..
Food: We at first ordered Hot and sour chicken soup which was a bit spicy but tasted well.. Then from the starter we took crispy chicken which was sufficient in quantity for 3 of us.. It was delicious and was not too very crispy making it difficult to chew.. Atlast when we were confused about what to have for the main course, we finally settled for mixed sizzler which had 2 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of fish and 2 pieces of prawn..I really loved it.. The fishes were well cooked and i would say it is one of the best sizzler i had in recent times..
Service: The service was very friendly..The waiter infact guided us well through the food menu and he was the one who actually suggested us the mixed sizzler..
Price: I would love to visit this place again because it offers good food in a sufficient quality as well as reasonable price.. The above mentioned food along with two freshlime sodas and soft drinks costed something around 700-750 rupees..I would definately visit this place soon as i badly want to have the mixed sizzlers again.. :p

Visiting since my childhood days when the name was only Sizzlers. However, trying sizzlers is a strict no no here. One can try the Chinese and the North Indian dishes that they have to offer. My favorites are the Shaahi Paneer and the mutton boti masala. The kebabs offered are also nice. I have tried the Chinese dishes very few times but they are ok.

This one is located just near 2 da vivekananda  crossing....and has a gud reputatn in da locality..
Its a gud place for a casual dining out n has a very cozzy feeling bout it,especially da upper floor... Went here wd 3 friends 2 times so here it is wat it turned 2 be..
During our first visit we chose 4 an indian cuisine n ds s Wat we ordered: masala kulchas ,biriyani, chicken bharta n chicken handi. Masala kulchas were really great n had a thick layer of stuffin...the biriyani was also gud n ws less in oil..I wud rate da biriyani a 3/5...the 2 chicken dishes were da stand out 1 both were really gud n 4 me it ws atleast unexpected in dat price atleast...easily could match a number of big resturaunts wd dat....so 4 da Indian cuisine I would gve ds place a 4/5 simply because I fl its offerin mre dan its price range...ful value 4 money
Second time we chose 4 chinese.....ordered egg fried rice, chicken chow, hong Kong chicken n chicken baby corn. 1st which needs 2 b mentioned here ws da quality of rice.. Easily its on par wd dat f bigger restraunts...n again I nid 2 mentn dat da price compared 2 da quality ws very affordable.... Next comes da chow, it ws gud but couldn't match da rice...still far above its expextatn given da price range...da honking chicken dint have a variety f taste, simply put it ws just spicy n no other taste cud b felt bt chicken pieces were soft n well cooked..ds ws da 1st dish which she'd sme drawback....nw da last 1,chicken baby corn, really tasty, da gravy ws very well cooked n da chicken was soft n cooked thoroughly...da bby corns had a mixture f salty n a very light creamy flavour which makes it soothing if ur having it wd a spicy dish...overall I would rate da Chinese a 3.5/5
Only draw back ds place has is da order time it takes 2 gve ur order bt oda dan dat da staff s gud nt wd so much f expertise or professionalism but still decent.
Summary:
1.food: 
a)Indian:-4/5
b)Chinese:-3.5/5
2.infrastructure:-3/5 (considering da price range)
3.service:-2.7-3/5
4)price:-4/5
5)overall:-3.5/5
It an ideal place 4 a normal day dine out,wd not a high budget but a good quality f food n a cozy ambience..and da USP of ds place s da value 4 money dre r very few restraunts in Kolkata which offer food of ds quality In ds price range

On hearing about the excellent mixed sizzler.. I rush to this food joint to find that the cook is unwell so continental will not be available.  Hearing this. I decide to do nothing but eat my favourite chinese. A chicken sweetcorn soup. A gravy chowmein n a dry chilli fish made my day.. I loved loved it. But I would have been happier . If I cud actually have the properwala sizzler. So will go back again.

This restaurant is the personification of an oasis. 
Amidst a host of jewelery shops, this cute cosy place stands inviting, with white doors. You enter and there is a spiral staircase at a short distance, you go up and sit down at an area resembling pretty much the restaurant at a Rajasthani palace. With white tables and chairs, and white walls and mirrors, the decor is smartly designed, making the best of a small space. 
The menu offers a large variety of choices, from Indian to Chinese and even Continental. We were a party of two, and devout continental lovers, so with a little hesitation we decided to risk it and ordered the mixed sizzler platter. And didn't we get a oh-so-pleasant surprise!
With jumbo prawns, chicken and fish, two pieces of each, all nestled in a soft barbeque sauce coated with roasted beans, potatoes, onions, carrots and mushrooms, the dish was just what we needed. I wouldn't say they match up to Park Street standards, but they did have a good score! Especially in a place like bidhan sarani!
Management was prompt, and the ac also works- so City's Sizzler gets a jolly good thumb's up from me. 
Good attempt people! Keep it up! :)

Not a very good place fr dinner. Service is very poor. We had to wait about an hour fr two plates of noodles. Though price is moderately cheap, cooking is not so good, most of the dishes were unavailable.

The chicken sizzler of this place is nothin but delicious. The chicken pieces were succulent with a crisp outer coating .Among their indian menu mutton  items are a must have. We ordered mutton bhuna which had 5 pieces of meat and was cooked so well  that it melted in the mouth. Oil was also minimum. Chinese item like mixed fried rice was also tasty with generous amount  of shrimps and chicken julliens. 
One drawback of this place is their shortage of manpower as a result of which you might have to wait very long for the food to reach your table. Otherwise its a cozy restaurant with very  polite staff and really good food.Will definately revisit .

I was surprised to see a sizzler serving restaurant at this part of the city. Even more surprised when found the sizzler was actually good. 

Food

They serve Chinese, Indian and Continental. In Chinese the soup we tried was good. The sizzler was good too. But the best dish we had was a Indian mutton dish. Excellent gravy and actually melt in your mouth pieces of mutton.

Ambiance 

Decent place to visit with friends and family. Service was good.

Best Point

Their menu. Was surprised to find items like Chow Chow Rice in the menu. Never found these items on non Chinese operated restaurants. 

Negative

On one 6 seating table they kept two phones and few papers on one side and used it as a 2/3 seating table. Those who will be forced to seat there wont have a very pleasing experience. Also for some dishes the quantity was small (soup for example)

It is a very cozy restaurant, that serves Chinese, Indian, and continental, as the name suggests its the only restaurant that serves sizzlers in the locality and they are good at it, and you get the tastiest mutton keema here, Chinese is lot  better than what you  get around here.
