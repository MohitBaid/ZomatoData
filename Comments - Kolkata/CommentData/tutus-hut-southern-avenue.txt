A small place with an indifferent person to answer you. The food they serve is below average. I tried their chowmein, momo and even their manchurian, and each of them were uniquely bad. Quantity and taste can compete each other in which is worse!! Never going back

I was so enticed by the menu that I rushed in for some nice Burmese khao suey or tibetien momos... sadly the outlet served nothing in vegetarian. Finally when I was about to leave the guy at the outlet said he could make thukpa for us in veg. It was very average very oily, quite thick unlike how it's supposed to be. Taste was ok not too bad.

I had many fond memories of this place.It is close to the coaching class I used to attend in class 11-12.Between 2 classes there used to be a break when I often dropped by this place to gorge on their steamed momos,soups(chicken clear soup and sweet corn soup used to be my regular orders).Loved having those comfort food during the evening time in the outdoor sitting area.
They were really good and was suitable for the small budget during school days. Will surely drop by some day to re-live that nostalgia.

One of the first places to serve Burmese in Kolkata. There was a time when Sunday evening meant momos in tutu after masala thumbsup from southern avenue. Went in a month back and just got the momos on the go and it's still better than the chain store bullshit.

Behind the Vivekananda Park, this tiny food joint has been there ever since I remember. I love their steamed momos, and today when I went there after a long time, I couldn't help but order momos again. The coating is ultra thin and steamed through well, and the chilli sauce is sure to make you sweat. The chicken crispy however, was average.

This place beside Vivekananda Park and opposite Kamala Girls School has been around for a long time now but it has remained just a little better than a roadside shack. Now with so many eating places of various types coming up in the vicinity it needs to up its ante to attract customers. I found the place completely empty one evening with a lone staff member, acting as chef,server and cashier. They have Chinese, Tibetan and Burmese cuisine and should have been doing great business. ( but obviously something is lacking that's why they're unable to draw in more customers).  The steamed veg momos which we had was reasonably good with substantial filling and thin layer as covering. Moreover I was happy to note that it wasn't broken.( unlike a Momo chain which is proliferating all over the city but serves broken momos). The accompanying red sauce too was good,hot enough to add zing to the steamed momos.

I only tried 'Chicken Khau suey' over here. Since I have never tried this dish before, comments assessing the taste of it will not be an apt thing to do. But yeah, if I had to say from the generic foodie point of view, I would say that my taste buds were extremely delighted. Though not a classy place, but an Eve with chicken khao suey, will see a lot of me..

I tried chicken khow suey and it's really very tasty. I am rating 5 for only khow suey as I have not tried anything else so can't comment on other food.  The quantity is less but taste is really good.  It has very very small seating arrangment but one can wait long if the soul purpose is having khow suey only.  As bayleaf got shut down I have no other place to go for khow suey.  If you order one day before they can also prepare mohinga for you which is also very tasty one. The price are all inclusive of tax so no extra charge... the coolers are also cheap in price.  A must visit

A small joint near southern avenue,had visited there to have some veg momos.

Walked in and ordered a plate of steamed veg momo which was priced at Rs.70. Small cosy place with very limited seating (can accomodate 10 pax).

The momos were steamed well and the sauce was neither too spicy nor too bland. Filling inside the momos was way too little,you can feel flour more than the veggies. So in all food quality was average,although i feel 70rs for that momo a bit on the higger side.

There was only one person who was the cook cum cashier cum waiter. Boy they are well under staffed. So,if you are going there,you need good amount of time in hand as your orders might take long.

This joint is nothing but a established road side joint.

Might give it another shot,but not really a favourable option.

Ps - review based on vegetarian food only.

Had takeaways from this small but effervescent place on the road alongside Vivekananda Park. The momo's were delicious and i got to know later that they were hand made by the owner herself, a spirited lady, working her socks off to put authentic Burmese & Tibetan food to the palate of Kolkatans'. Prices will suit many a college goer, like me. A snoop in now and then to have a plate of steamed momo's are a Must!!!

A small joint, which serves great momos and authentic Burmese food. Well priced but a little inconvenient to eat as sitting places are really few. But one can always try.

This place is really adorable located just beside Vivekananda park. It was a regular E spot during my college days. 
The interior is decently decorated nd they have the small tools to sit. 
Their muglai parathas are big stuffed nd really nice.. Infact better than My Club.But I guess they stopped serving muglai parathas nd changed their menu to Chinese nd Tibetan dishes.   Now they serve momos as well nd its decent not bad not good. Just ok to satisfy your evening hunger. I m looking forward to try their other dishes from new menu.
The staffs r well behaved nd make u feel a vip with ur every visit.

The momos are really nice but the salt is generally a bit on the higher side. The rolls are good. However,the rotis are very thin. It's like if you cut the roll to pieces then you can literally serve it as spring roll. The place is a little over priced if you see the standard of the place and the quality of food but all in all you can try it out.

This place is near my mother's office in Sarat Bose road. Go straight with Russa Exchange to your right, skip the first crossroad, and take a right turn in the next. IT is red and white and has remained so for a pretty long time. Do not expect AC or spacious sitting arrangements, but they serve tasty and pocket-friendly food. Their USP are the momos. The Chinese is not half-bad, but I have had better. They specialise in Burmese food, which may not be available at a short notice. You may need to place an order in advance. But I have had khao suey here (which was delicious) and took home a delivery of Chet Tha Hsibiyen (people who had it thought it was uber-tasty). They also sell dried fish here if you are interested. I used them as a substitute for bonito flakes while making miso.

I agree with the other reviews that yes being a road side shop its little pricy but then don't forget gautams which is also a road side and almost equally priced.I'm a vegetarian and is fond of steam momos and rolls here.I have never find such fresh momos in any other road side shop.

I had a thukpa, and I can't say I was altogether disappointed. It cost 90 Rs.  It DID have pieces of chicken in it, but I have to say, I felt slightly hungry afterwards.
The only problem was - it burnt my tongue! It was really hot when they gave it, but I was so hungry that I just took a big mouthful, and..... agh!

Anyway, the taste was slightly like "home food", not really "restaurant food", but still, if you want to go here, I won't dissuade you....

A roadside shop with Michelin prices. U will fail to understand the basis of pricing in this particular place. A little bigger than a roadside tea shop, this place has snacks marked at exorbitant high prices compared to what it serves as a food outlet, in terms of location, ambience, food quality and quantity.

Location: In the lane adjacent to Vivekananda Park; in the lane adjacent to Jugal's, Gariahat.

Can be reached by moving straight ahead into the lane. Tutu's Hut is a small eatery serving Chinese and Tibetan fare with an outside seating of twelve heads and an inside seating of  eight heads. Happened to come across this place while on my usual evening rounds and dropped by for a quick bite. The table calendar style menu quite amused me but, can be redesigned a bit.
Ordered a plate of Steamed Momos (Veg.) which were found to be thinly layered and had a flavorful filling. The accompaniment along was spicy enough to pair along.

The staff was friendly but, the service was slow.
A pocket friendly affair this place is.
The hygiene levels were found to be a bit on the lower side.

An above average experience.

Very disapointed with the quality of food as well as quantity compared to the price they are charging. We had gravy chow which was bad. Momo were not filled at all and lollipops you hardly find any chicken. Over all taste is below average. I guess you get better food nearby at the same or below cost.

I've never eaten an egg of Rs.20/- in a roll and that too in such a small restaurant. People should just follow the rates before listening to the staff member's advice... They simply misguide you for their extra billing...

My single encounter with Tutu's Hut happened one fine day about a month back. I was with a colleague who wanted to eat something and we ordered from this joint since it looked okay. Our order was very simple - double chicken roll, chicken momos and egg chicken roll. The momos were indeed very soft and tasty, and the roll was quite heavy, although I have had better in Iceberg which is nearby. The service is all right, considering the fact that there were a good number of people waiting for their food here. However, it can do better.

Burmese Food is never available although they publicise it as their USP. Everytime you order one, you would be invariably told that 'it has just got finished' OR 'it has not been prepared today but was available yesterday'. Heeee...   :)

Tutu's Hut, though the name sounds weird is located in the lane before the fillers while coming from Lake kalibari towards Golpark It is located very near to the Cuppa coffee shop. Due to unavoidable rain and my urge to eat out, i decided to visit this place. I had ordered 2 veg momos and 1 veg lung fung soup. The momo turned out to be good but they didnot provide me with the soup they serve with momo. Thats where they lacked. Lung Fung soup was good but could have been better.

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:- 

Pros
1) Its a small place and has managed to accommodate quite a large number of people by putting chairs and tables outside too.
2) Has minimal numbers of staffs but they are polite. 
3) Provides a burmese speciality - Khowsuey which i always love to eat but wasn't available today. 
4) Located at a posh location
5) It is clean as compared to other fast food corners. 

Cons
1)  Prices are little on the higher side. 
2) More development and renovation is highly required. 
3) The Menu/a la carte needs to be designed properly and should not be like a simple plain paper. 

Rest, no complaints. :) Had awesome time.
