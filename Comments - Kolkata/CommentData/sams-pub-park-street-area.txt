I visited  this place on saptami with a group of friends.  Location  is good.  Situated  in the middle of park street it is easily accessible.  It has 2 sections. One is dining  area with proper lights  and the other section has dim light. Prices of alcohols are good.  Service  could have been little better though.  Coming to ambiance the restaurant  needs to repaired. It looks a little old.

If there's one place that I have visited again and again and over and over again, then it's Sam's.. and the reason would be a decent ambience, a nice band and probably the best Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Tetrazini and LIIT.
I found my experience​ quite satisfying although they didn't exactly have all the drinks that they showed on the menu. Still, a nice spot and certainly one I would keep visiting!!!

Nice and decent place, cost of beer is slightly high and place is always vacant. Hot foods with cool environment. Must visit with your friends

If you are looking for a cheap pub with a decent ambience, this is the place for you. Coupled with a nice band and good food, I found my experience​ quite satisfying although they didn't exactly have all the drinks that they showed on the menu. Still, a nice spot and certainly one I would like to come back soon!

There isnt much to describe about this place. I happened to drop in earlier today but there was nothing to take back from this place. Food and drinks are overpriced and the attendants do not care to help you out. I ordered chilli cheese toast with specific instructions of making it without onions but unfortunately that never happened. The place is big enough and could do better after renovation or change in the atmosphere.

One Word Verdict: Average
OK this is an average place with decent service
Went for a beer and ordered a draught and salad
The salad didn't taste fresh but the beer was OK
The place had a humid smell inside, which would have made me more uncomfortable if i had been eating here
Will i go there again:ummmmmm no

Horrible experience. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chilly chicken, a side dish of fish too can't remember the name and each and every dish were far from being tasty. Ambience was awful and the ac was not working. Excessively over priced considering to the standard of delivery. The waiters demanded more money as tip although he was given 200 as tip. So all in all one of the worst experience I had in any park Street area restro.

A park street explorer, this place remained undiscovered ever since. founded in 1860 s in  England and 1912 in Calcutta the traditional liqouor joint is located bang opposite bengal club s gate on the little russel street. counter stools and 4 in tables and a live counter for music , apart from the excess red ambience all seems to fall in place. Baked fish had an uniqueness among the other snacks we ordered. USP - tuesday friday and sunday you get to hear retro pops and a very passionate singer who keeps all the tables on toes. must go.

Alcohol? Cheap.
Ambience? Good.
Band? Exemplary.
Service? Good.

This bar is on Russel Street. We had Tequila (or is it Indian Mojave?), Domestic liquor, and Baileys. For all these three things and a bit of finger food, the bill was within a merciful Rs. 1000. What sets it apart from the other bars in Park Street is its service and prices, yes there are places cheaper than this, but not by much. We could find seats easily. 

The ambience was gratifying, as the place was being swept by Imagine by John Lennon, and with drinks in hand, the night was as peaceful and hopeful as the song. Special thanks to the band for setting a great mood.

What could have been better though, was its decor and lighting. Intoxication is set about faster in a drowsy lighting. But who goes to a bar to check the decor anyway. Right?
