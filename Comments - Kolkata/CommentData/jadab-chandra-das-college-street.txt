This place sells outstanding sweets. And the mishti doi (sweetened yogurt/curd) is absolutely awesome. This has to feature in the destination list of any sweet  lover in Kolkata.

After eating a sumptuous lunch I tried there Misti doi which is good. Also tried there rosogolla which is not like K.C. Das but soft, tasty, a bit over sweetened. Chocolate stuffed sondesh was good here and inspite of being full I had to eat one more of this sondesh. It's lovely.

Another small outlet on Keshab Chandra Road, the sweet store is an old one in this region. Sweets quality are fantastic. They mostly sell Sandesh here. I tried one with white outer and Chocolate stuffed inside. It was wonderful.
Tried their Kesar Sandesh, yellow in color it was again hit.
Sandesh range from Rs.6-15 here and you will love each one of them.

Went to this renowned outlet yesterday and had Pedas. The quality seemed to be good, although its ages since I went to them when I was a child. Overall, was satisfied with the quality and taste issue.

I have been a regular customer of this outlet ever since I was a small child as my relatives stay very close to this place. My uncle used to get their Basanta Bahar for me whenever I was visiting. It is a sandesh with a yellow coating on top which is pure milk cream (sor). I always ate up the sandesh part first and saved the coating for the end. I still retain a fascination for that sweet. Their chandrapulis, made only during the Durga Puja season are the best in the city, period. It is great that in spite of all kinds of fusion sweets making the rounds these days, they stick to making traditional Bengali sweets and make them so well.

Tasted the sweet only once, was moderate....
The place is very unhelathy, a public toilet just beside the place where they make sweets....
Don't feel like having sweets here....
But yet, u can always bring it back home and have it..

Nostalgic an outlet...unlike new age multi-branch sweet shops with infinite numbers of hybrid items (sweets!!!) in the name of "innovation" mushrooming in the city...they have maintained their age old simplicity and limiting the offerings within 7-8 items...

My work frequently brings me to Jhamapukur Lane & I make sure to have at least 1 piece of sweet (mainly Sandesh) while leaving the place...

I personally recommend Golap Sandesh & Aam Sandesh with Nut fillings.

Chitrakoot & Pantua are good but their Sandesh is what I prefer & recommend.

Price point-wise I wonder how have they maintained the price without compromising with the quality.

Once upon a time, I used to live in the lane just next to Jadab Chandra Das. This sweet shop has been a part of my childhood. Loved their Mishti doi and Khirer Chhanch. Â I have lots of memories associated with this place....
