It's a review of an old experience. Day was 14th August, 2016.

One thing to convey to all viewers, please please seek suggestions from the staffs while you go for a menu selection, otherwise it may end into a rustic experience.

Since we couldn't perfectly judge the food joint, but seemed to be a good one for us, I have given 5 star here. The ratings may be updated later on based upon the experiences time to time.

This had been in my wish list for a long time & I'm happy to finally tick it off. We ordered a variety of dishes as we wanted to try it all. We had Tenderloin steak, Pork ribs, Pot roasted mutton, Spaghetti with meatballs & a few desserts. The steak was scrumptious & the pork ribs was no less than divine. The cherry on the top was when we ordered two desserts & got one for free. The ambience was decent. Simply loved the place! If you want to try steaks, this is really a good place to visit.

Dropped in here for lunch. The place is a bit cozy. I do noticed the vintage clock. The staff is quite courteous. But the food takes a bit of a time to reach your plate. We ordered some Irish broth. It was just average in taste. It had noodles with a mix of chicken and mutton minces . Next we ordered for some chelo kebabs which tasted decent. The last order was pork ribs (320 grams). The ribs tasted good. But could have been much better. However the pork ribs does pack a lot of fat. So if you're not a fan of pork fat then refrain from ordering this one. Overall a moderate to good rating in terms of quality and taste .

I went to The Steak Factory wid my friends on the 31st...we were really excited as we heard about this awesome place before...we ordered old monk üçï...the fireshow was jaw-dropping üòÄüòÄüòÄ...along wid that we ordered chicken steak..I'm not mentioning the taste and quality of the food again as u all can easily understand by the rating I gave...XD One thing which was slightly disappointing was the service..they took a long time to serve..üòê..but overall it was a mind-blowing experience and a perfect place to go for continental lovers..I will cherish this memory till my last breath I swear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Located somewhere in southern avenue, the steak factory is small cafe with approx 10 to 12 tables

Coming to the food which is the most imp thing, I was not at all impressed..
We ordered- 
Mozzarella cheese stick which was horrible in taste,

Assorted fries ( onion rings, French fries, potato wedges) were also not good

Chicken nugget was okayish

Coolers were ok

There were only 1 or 2 types of desserts available that day and I was not in the mood to try those..

I'm giving 3 points only because of 320 gram steak..
My partner tried that n he was happy that at least he got something good to eat üòÇ

Staff were also good and helpful..

I just want them to improve the quality of there food because food is everything ..

Great place if you like to try some real exotic food.
Following are my food ratings:
Fire and Ice chilli drink-5/5 one of the best mocktails I ever had..Virgin Mojito with green chillies  giving it the spicy flavour.
Flaming Old monk Pizza- 4/5 Pretty good this was..that pizza burning due to addition of Old Monk was a fascinating watch..Lamb balls were in that pizza and small shredded pork/beef meat(couldn't be sure).. quantity was good too..4 becaz the following dishes were better :3
Chicken steak with Bacon&eggs add ons:4.5/5 Brilliant again the steak was with boiled veggies french onions..and the bacon add on was yum...the pork fat melted in my mouth..and even the eggs were prepared very well.. authentic Steak no doubt..could improve on the quantity of chicken though..in the steak
Factory Mixed grilled sizzler: 4/5..a dish which had everything beginning from chicken,lamb,mutton,pork sausages,prawns,french fries,veggies and what not..Tasted pretty good..except the sausages which was surprisingly pretty poor in comparison to others..even the mutton pieces could be improved upon..removing unwanted fat..the chicken,lamb&prawn were pretty tasty and so was the whole dish overall..Minor improvement would get it 5easily.
Ambience 4/5: Pretty good the outlook was..the bathroom walls had amusing posters too :3
Just a little cramped it was.. otherwise prefect.
Service 4/5: Although the waiters were very well mannered and kept giving water&stuff whenever we asked(although not frequently)..dishes took a long time to come specially the pizza and Steak...the sizzler suprisingly arrived quicker.. although the dishes were exotic and could take time..a little speeding up of delivery would be good for them too..cause its quite filled during lunch time.
All the dishes were carefully choosen by scanning the reviews and they lived up to their expectations..hence all 4were good,unique and recommended..their Tengerlin Steak(Buffalo meat) , Crispy Chilli octopus,bacon fried Pork chop are some of the dishes I hope to try on my next visit.Also quantity is decent and this place has good value for money considering the type of Dishes they serve..pretty exotic and not easily available.
Huge thumbs up to this beautiful place..will visit here whenever I save up some bucks with me  again(and yes..price is moderate here..our bill was around Rs1360).

One of the most well known steak house in Kolkata, THE Steak Factory, Lake Place invited us¬†#MunchingMonks¬†for sampling their new winter menu which was specially curated by Chef¬†Rohan Chanda, we were impressed with the european influence in the dishes, each having a distinct flavour. Overall, a satisfying experience to keep things sorted on Monday !! First of the December !!

Long awaited place and Steak Factory doesn't really upset me. I went there with my friends. The place is really east to find. Take the lane just beside the Gallary Gold and the outlet is in your left. We took Pinacolada but honestly I didn't really like it and Mutton Pot Roasted is a must try.

Situated at a quiet locality of South Kolkata this place is a gem.The cosy atmosphere with the right amount of quirks makes the instant connect.Besides being polite and cooperative the waiters have great taste of music also.With the lovely Fire and Ice Chilli Drink we waited for the food and they served really fast.Fried Pork Belly melted in the mouth and Mozzarella stuffed Lamb Meatballs were quite interesting in terms of preparation and taste.Cheese stuffed Tenderloin Steak baked with Garlic and Wine was superb and very filling.So was the Bacon stuffed Pork Chops,amazing taste and quality.Sigh they didn‚Äôt have the Ferrero Rocher cake on that day!But if you are looking for steaks then this fabulous factory is a must go place in every sense.

Easy to locate. Ambience, decorations, service all are really good. We had fish and chips,lamb lasagna,ham steak and virgin mojito. The only dish that left no negative marks in my mouth was lamb lasagna,perfectly cooked lamb layered with pasta and cheese.Ham steak was average,will expect broccoli instead of boiled cauliflower next time. Fish and chips highly disappointed me ,the fish was more like a normal fry.Service really made me happy. So my all over experience helped me to rate this restro over my little bit poor experience about food obviously except the lasagna.

The one name that probably comes first in the list of steak houses of the town. Located amidst residential lanes of southern avenue, it is at a 5-6 mins walking distance from Ravindra sarobar lake.

This place is a ground floor of a old red building that'll remind you of your days at North Kolkata and upon entering, it's a whole changed ambiance, with 80's songs playing on a loop ( idk why they played 'country roads take me home' thrice while we were there, but that only made me love this place more, GREAT PLAYLIST SIR/MA'AM, WHOEVER YOU ARE ), pop posters hanging, soothing lighting and a view of a calm street outside.

The service was prompt, someone from the kitchen came personally and served with a generous smile, servings were well portioned and a treat to the eyes.

Coming to the food, the servings of steaks were served with a generous amount of golden, crispy french fries, a salad of boiled assorted vegetables and onions. Growing up eating steaks with egg-poaches on the top made me miss that one thing terribly, no complaints tho. The complaint however, the chunk of meat had bones, quite a few of them, making it harder to chop with a knife, the chicken one was fine as we Bengalis dropped those knives and reversed to our hands of expertise. Pricings were okay too. A good choice if you're in the area for a afternoon over good music and meat.

Heard the buzz of this place serving delicious chicken steaks, so couldn't give it a miss. Dropped in here with friends on a crowded evening time. 
There's nothing distinct about the decor, but the ambience was relaxed, casual. The staffs were courteous and amicable. We ordered Chicken steak, fresh lime soda and caramel custard. The steak was good indeed, but can't say the same for the dessert. The taste-factor was impressive, but the quantity was too less.

Great ambience, simple cozy setup with good music. Polite service staff. Had been planning to visit this joint for quite some time, it was worth the wait. We ordered the sausage wrapped in bacon N cheese for starters. It was just perfect. Crunchy on outside, molten cheese oozing out along with the spicy mayo dip, it just kept us craving for more. For main course we didn't want to miss out on their signature dishes so we ordered the factory mixed grill, minced mutton steak and factory special chicken cheese steak, keeping our fingers crossed. The dishes were just cooked to perfection. Freshly sauted veggies, French fries and mashed potatoes alongside did compliment the taste buds quite well. If you like things spicy and have a good appetite then the mutton steak is the one for you. The chicken cheese steak was awesome too. The mix grill was the showstopper for me. Chicken, mushrooms, sausages and veggies all cooked to perfection. Do try out this place. Big thumbs up.

This place is located a bit interior to Southen Avenue but a place with fine dining and well decorated walls and low light ceiling bulbs‚úå‚úå
Coming to the food we ordered-
CHICKEN SIZZLER:- The sizzler tasted at its bestüòãüòãwellcooked and it was yumm.
PORK KEBAB:- It was well garnished and served. The kebabs could have been more soft. It was undercooked. So would just them to cook it properly.
The 1 marks deduction is for thatüòê
The next thing which disappointed me was that while we entered and took our seat we had to call them to serve water which should be the first way to welcome guests so 0.5 for thatüò∂
Hope they would serve us better the next time ‚úå‚úå

After a sumptuous meal it's mandatory to have dessert so ordered apple pie with ice cream. I was so full and satisfied üòç.

The food was below average. I ordered french fries, mozarella cheese sticks, factory cheese steak and pork chops. The fries were cold and tasted like animal skin. The cheese sticks were of similar taste.  The steak was a bit chewy and the sauce was unnecessarily tart. The pork chops were better but all of the items were cold so the taste was ruined. The mashed potato lacked cheese. Wastage of money from my side

Actully we went to rabindra sorobor, It is very near to the lake 
Restaurant is very small and cinematic ambience is everywhere
Hollywood movie posters are everywhere , even if in bathroom
We took chicken steak , bird's nest pizza , bbq meat pizza , cream chicken soup
Chiken steak was very good
Cream chicken soup was very very good 
Birds mest pizza was ok ok type
Bbq meat pizza was also good
Cheese stuffing was bad in pizzas 
Overall , it is good if you love these kind of foods

Virgin mojito: soooo goood.
Shirley temple: almost good,didn't like the floaty ginger bits.twice the length of the glass of mojito.

Pork sausage wrapped in bacon and cheese: 4.5/5
Tastes so great, however ,this being my first bacon,I don't have a reference point.But it wasn't as heavy as I expected it to be, with it's fatty layer and then the cheese.It was delicious.
Four pieces,big bite-size,served with a cheesy orange coloured dip which tastes like sharp cheddar.The dip tastes perfect.

Chicken steak: looked real good,served with fries,onions and a poached egg on top.I didn't taste it..
Portion was enough for one person with small-medium appetite.

Tenderloin steak cooked in wine jus and cheese: 4.2/5
The layer of cheese was burnt bitter,at some places,and hard at a place,which I got rid of.
Other than that,it was lovely.I asked for a medium-rare,got a medium.Still,real tasty.Better than the one I had at chili's.Satisfied my steak craving(craving of the week).
Served with fried veggies and onions, mashed potatoes and the dip.The veggies were fresh and tasty too.
Portion enough for one person with medium to big appetite.

Chocolate Monte Carlo: 4/5 it tasted beautiful,lowest layer salty,above layer chocolate and cream.
The cherry tasted hard and funky,very different from ripe fresh cherries I have had, and I didn't like that.

CON: I wanted a tiramisu.They didn't have it.They only had 3-4 of the total dessert menu items available.Half a star deducted for that.Donot put things on the menu,that you cannot serve ,on demand.


Service: 5/5
Quick but timely,perfect.They brought out each item when the previous one was finished.Right on time and warm as food should be served.

Price: reasonable.

Ambience: 4.7/5
A few minutes walk away from the commotion of the streets,small space,lit by ceiling lights, perfect for date evenings.
Will revisit!

Me along with my friends went there last month in a rainy day to enjoy some hot steaks. But instead our hopeful souls got upset as the quality of the food stuffs we ordered was damn average. The pork steak we ordered had more than 3/4th of fat. As we complained, they gave another steak with same teeny tiny amount of meat in that. Also the Florentine Fish we asked for had loads of cheese in it and the proportion of fish content was negligible. Chicken risotto and mixed steak was atleast upto the mark. So, if you wish to have steak, don't come here; try another restaurant for that.

Perfect start for the last month of the year to start with‚Ä¶ December ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì > Winter ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì > Steaks‚Ä¶!!. Went to their Southern Avenue Outlet. Located just near to Menoka Cinema Hall. Ambience was quite nice and cosy. Perfect for some date with steaks in front of you. The restaurant is big enough with three rooms to dine in with nice modern decor.
                    

On the recommended list ‚Äì Bird nest pizza, Cheesy hasselback chicken and Bacon st pork chop.

*Fire and Ice ‚Äì A new twist in the mojito. To combine the formula of blending cold with hottness. Here is it. Mixing green chilly with the cold mojito givig this a perfect name of ‚ÄúFire and Ice‚Äù. It was good but the heat and flavour of green chilly is so much that it‚Äôs little bit hard to consume.

*Chilly Octopus‚Äì tried for the first time. Wont comment on it much. Tasted good.
*Bacon st pork chop‚Äì Before describing this I must say about the quality. Bang on. The best pork chop. Nicely cooked and flavour of the pork is perfect.

*Bird nest pizza ‚Äì The best in the list. The pizza was just awesome. The thick crust of the pizza with the cheesy layers and with loads of cheese pockets. The best in the deal. A boiled yolk of the egg was served as a topping in the middle with loads of chicken. Loved it. Recommended.

*Old monk pizza‚Äì The pizza served with toppings of meatballs. The flambe was done with pouring old monk over it. A new concept in trend of mixing alcohol with food. needs improvement though.

*Fish Aligot‚Äì The boneless fish fillets being served with the layers of spinach and cheese and being served with garlic bread. The layer of cheese need to be improved as it was just tasting a bit like cottage cheese. Otherwise its good overall.

*Cheesy hasselback chicken‚Äì Grilled chicken served with veggies and tangy sauce! The sauce was just awesome.. Really going with that chicken chunk. Recommended.

Steak dinners are becoming quite popular in the city and Steak factory makes for one of well known joints when it comes to steaks.The decor is done in red and white with beautiful lamps hanging overhead.The joint is located in a little lane near Menoka cinema.The staff is extremely courteous when it comes to taking orders and keeping an eye on the table.

The Steak factory has added quite an interesting choice of dishes to their existing menu.The new picks include

üçÅFire and ice--A Mocktail version of the mexican mojito.Perfect balance of sweet with a hint of chilli that gives that kick.
üçÅChilly octopus--Spicy and perfectly tossed in sauces this one serves as a good starter.
üçÅBacon st pork chop--The pork chop glazed with a shine served with veggies ,sauce and french fries.The chops cooked just the way i like it.
üçÅBird nest pizza--This is every cheese lovers dish.The crust stuffed with cheesy that melts in your mouth with each bite
üçÅOld monk pizza--Flamed up with old monk this pizza was okay
üçÅFish Aligot-- The fish is topped with cheese.
 üçÅCheese Hassel back Chicken--Served with veggies ,sauce and mashed potato,the spinach stuffed chicken breasts was quite impressive.Though i feel the mash could have been better lacking in seasoning and texture.

Steak factory has a lot up its sleeves this winter for the upcoming festivities

Love this place.. Have been to the first outlet of Steak Factory, New Alipore umpteen number of times and simply love their offerings, specifically their Grilled Chicken and California Fish. This other outlet is located at Southern Avenue near Menoka Cinema and is way bigger and nicer in terms of ambience. Went there yesterday night for dinner and it was truly a wholesome treat to the tastebuds and we couldn't have been more satisfied. Our orders were:
üòç Fire and ice- A Virgin Mohito with a twist, topped with green chillies creating the perfect balance of fire and ice. It was very refreshing after a long day at work.
üòçChilly octopus- My most favorite out of the lot. The flavor was absolutely bang on and I highly recommend this item for this winter.
üòçBacon st pork chop- Another gem. The pork was just cooked to perfection with all the fat simply melting in the mouth.
üòçBird nest pizza- A pizza with cheese pockets served with wholesome toppings to take your away. Must try.
üòçOld monk pizza- This was the Flambe, where old monk was poured all over to lit up the pizza., Beautiful.
üòçFish Aligot- Served with mashed potatoes, boiled veggies and a lipsmacking sauce, the perfectly made fish fillet was topped with spinach puree.
üòçCheesy hasselback chicken- A must try for all cheese lovers for sure.
It was a Monday done right, killing all the Monday blues for sure. :)

Been there for the first time and I am too much happy with their service and food of course..
I had fish n chips.. tenderloin steak, chicken steak and stragonoff..each and every dish was Soooo good and tasty..I have tried steaks of different places but this is something different..
Their service is too good and the ambiance is also very attractive.
To me this is the best place in Kolkata for having steaks and sizzlers
Looking forward for the next visit
Thank you

This place is undoubtedly one of my favourite go to places
 It has a beautiful vintage ambience. What with posters of old rock bands and iconic popstars,digging into your steaks at this place give you the same chills you get at an old british steakhouse. Steaks and sizzlers are their pride.

Have visited this outlet earlier also and am quite pleased with their culinary. In my recent visit have tried out a new item suggested by the outlet crew.       " Fish Aligot" and it tasted good. It's a baked
Fish item topped with lots of cheese. We have ordered garlic bread which is all time favourite and they prepare it also with lot of care but our dessert was a disaster. We have ordered brownie with ice cream and we were served with a overcooked and half burnt item. It was really a shock. Hope in our next visit this item should take care off. All the best to the team.

The biggest fancy is the name. Next decor. Then food quality . Then service. Overpriced. Portion of food served is not satisfactory. I had to wait 45 minutes for my order. Place ( New Alipur ) is also a little claustrophobic. Not sure if I would revisit. Not with my own wallet ;-)

5 out of 5 from me. 

This is a place for people who know and love their meat, simple. 

Wonderful food. Was so engrossed that I actually didn't pay any attention to the decor (joking, that was aesthetic too). 

The owners are wonderful hosts and everyone walking in gets a personal attention, enthusiasts get a proper counselling and honest suggestions. The staff is courteous and friendly. 

Recommend all carnivores to go there.

An establishment who calls itself "Steak Factory" set my expectations quite high. Unfortunately, I could not help but be disappointed with their chicken steak. The mushroom sauce was way bland and needed to be more piquant. Adding oodles of oregano helped a little bit. The chicken was well cooked, but the caramelised onions was not properly caramelised and didn't add anything to the flavour of the dish. The same goes for the veggies. All in all, a filling but extremely bland dish. Another thing, it's better to have mashed potatoes instead of french fries with a steak. We also ordered Greek Salad, which had croutons that looked as if they were doused in oil. The grilled chicken was the saving grace of a completely dull meal. Again, the grilled chicken is not what it sounds like. It's 3 pieces of drumstick cooked in a peppery sauce. I mean, all the dishes seemed to be half-hearted attempts of a tired kitchen team. Maybe we just went on a bad day, but our experience was less than satisfactory.

Steak being the highlight in the name of this relatively "old & established" outlet in the sophisticated southern part of the city, we decided to give it a try.
Disappointed to learn that beef here is buff! Still we ordered a tenderloin steak, a pork chop and a couple of beers. The steak, being buff, was definitely not up to the expectations, while the pork chop was average despite the good quality of the meat. Taste? Just pass, for both the dishes.
Overall opinion - a single visit is good enough to judge this place.

I have visited this place time n again  but my last visit this Saturday was a big disappointed. We had ordered bacon cheese rolls for starters. Bacon was only fat and not cooked well. The cheese was chewy. Then for main course we had a ham cheese steak and hasselback back. Very disappointed. The meat part was very stiff n smelly. The staff were busy chatting n hardly had any time. To top it all the bill came n had VAT added to it. When I complained they subtracted the amount. But why would they charge Vat? What if we did not check the bill? Very bad experience. Will never go there again.

The ambience is really nice...simple and comfortable. The stuffs are well trained and have a proper knowledge of the food available in the meNu. They guided us nicely. We ordered fish and chips, chicken steak, chicken grilled steak and lazania. Everythinh we ordered was so very tasteful. It satisfied my tastebuds and the feeling was foodgasmic. I loved it all. Presentation was good. Not very costly nd not very cheap too...this place is  defintly a must visit. üòÅ

The review will be constructed based on 3 parameters:

1)Food
2)Ambience
3)Service

1)Food-The food here has really high ratings on Zomato,but I personally felt it was average.
We had the Crispy Fried Calamari,Factory Special Mixed Grill,Tenderloin Steak and Pork Chops.
The batter on the Calamari was really heavy and oily.
The Tenderloin Steak was a little tough even though we ordered medium and not well-done.The spice rub on the Steak was good.Mashed potatoes on the side were average.
The Pork Chop was really dry and tough.The spicing and taste were good,but it was just really dry in the middle.Pork shouldn't be that dry.
The Mixed grill was pretty good.For those who don't eat beef or Pork,the Mixed grill is a great alternative.

The food wasn't bad overall.It was Average.I expected better based on the ratings and reviews.

2)Ambience-Nothing special to talk about here decor wise.The seating is a little cramped.It's slightly inconvenient for families or large groups.The two-seater benches ar too small for two people to sit side by side and eat.

3)Service-Service was good.The staff were prompt and polite.

After going through a lot of reviews my sister and I decided to give it a try. And we weren't disappointed. The ambience was good and cozy. We tried chicken cordon bleu (though I am never fond of chicken I simply loved the dish) and my sister tried pork in hawaiian style (don't remember the name of the dish). The food was damn tasty and the service was good too. Overall a nice experience.

Judging by only food I would've rated it 0.5 lower; but as this city goes into its season transition, this place provides you a heart-warming experience!

Tender chicken filled with mozarella, wholesome roasted mutton in a pot and lastly that caramel custard... And to go with the ambiance, u cant nod away from the simple vibe of this small eatery...

It would've been more sumptuous if the mutton were a tad bit softer and we could get that FerreroRocher Cheese cake...

Nevertheless worth a try!

I've been to the Salt Lake steak factory which showered me with an immense happy feeling however this place was crammed in a traditional Bengali building . The food has to be marvellous bit expected gandharaj chicken which I missed badly , though the delicacies that we ordered were going pretty , had prawn cocktail for the first time as I don't prefer eating prawns outside . But loved the creamy sauce which the plate offered and then we had a chicken steak which is heavy z nutritious , not spicy but yet hunger quenching and also  had the grilled fish steak where the sauce was yummy and the fish was very fresh and tasted very nice . 
I hardly give a rate of 5 to any restaurant but the food of this place again took my heart and my desire to another level . Thank you to the management for keeping the same quality in all the branches and of course would love  to see my gandharaj chicken here üòÇ‚ô•Ô∏èüòçüòã

This place is located at southern avenue,a walking distance from the lake..well the menu shown here is a bit different because the no of items are less in the restaurant's menu may b due to kali puja or something..its actually a house which is modified into a restaurant,so the place is quite small but they play real good music that will surely cheer up ;).. they provide good service too.
We ordered
1.factory mixed grill-it contains bits of mutton,chicken and sausages tossed with onions and capsicum along with veggies and French fries.. taste is fine but mutton was a bit smelly
2.tenderloin steak-unlike in the menu given u have to add up the bacon wrapped thing if u want..quite good taste it is and comes along with veggies and mashed potato
3.brownie with ice cream-would rate it 4.5/5.. give it a try
PS- to all f.r.i.e.n.d.s fan,do visit the washroom üòé

Located on Lake Place Road,near the intersection from where one can go see both the Mudiali Club and Shibmandir Durga Pujo Pandals.

Like many other restaurants that have popped up in the Southern Avenue stretch,this place too is on the ground floor of a residential establishment.
We ordered Chicken Steak and Sizzler and the California Fish Fillet Steak.
All the dishes tasted well,though they took some time to be brought out.
Missed out on the bacon wrapped prawns this time,will have to visit this place again for that.

The seating arrangement is cramped,making it uncomfortable for tall people like me :p
Overall, a very good choice if one's craving for Continental.

I visited this place on puja nabami..on puja few menus are available.. I ordered grilled fish and chelo kebab..the price was high while the quantity served for one person was not sufficient..must say one thing price is unnecessarily high whereas not that much tasty food..the one thing that was good is the ambience.. Disappointed!!

While craving for steak, one day we decided to visit the Steak Factory at Southern avenue. This was the second time I was visiting this resturant chain. We really like the place, it was quite cosy and comfortable. We ordered two Tenderloin steaks along with Virgin Mojito for me and one Orange drink from the menu for my friend. We were very satisfied with the steak, it was nicely done but the vegetables given in the platter was smelling of viniger and had turned sour completely. The behavior of the staff was very good. Mojito was good but my friend was a bit disappointed with his drink and complained it's not quite sweet. Anyways, experience was not extremely good nor bad. Will visit again!!

We had heard a lot about this place and it didn't live up to the hype. The restaurant itself is a smallish affair and is decently, if a tad frugally, decorated. Can't speak too highly of the hygiene as there was a dead fly on my table. The fried calamari tasted terrible and the batter was too thick and the whole dish was oily. Reminded me of my neighbourhood 'telebhaja'. The rest of the food was good. The mutton pot-roast did not disappoint and the pork chops were quite substantial. The food tasted okay but it is nothing to write home about. The staff was a mixed bag. One of the waiters was trying hard but clearly had no experience but the others were all busy watching football. They serve you with very glum faces.

After reading so many review about the Steak Factory in Zomato, Finally we have visited the restaurant yesterday. First of all I would like to request Zomato to upload the current Menu Card of the Steak Factory because lots of Items which are showing here in zomato are not served according to the new menu card of this restaurant (for example Sizzlers, Live Ice Cream, Cheese cakes etc.)Now about the restaurant. The restaurant is located in a very decent place. Decor of the restaurant is simple but very sober and elegant.¬†FOOD: We have ordered one plate of Swiss Salad, one Chicken Steak, one Fish Florentine and a Caramel Custard.¬†
1.Swiss Salad: It is made of chicken salami, onion, capcicum and mayonnaise. The swiss salad was very delicious and you can feel each and every flavour of everything separately. Every must try this at least once.¬†2. Chicken Steak: Everyone knows that the steak factory make best steak in the city. It was just awesome in taste. if you will visit the steak factory you must order it. The served it with soft, juicy grilled meat with a poached egg, french fries and sauteed veggies.¬†3. Fish Florentine: It was also very delicious but they must add little bit more salt i it.4. Caramel Custard: This was very much average in taste according to the price. I don't like to order this particular item further and will also not recommend other to order.¬†Overall experience is excellent and will like to visit this place again and again and like to taste all the items listed in the menu.

Stale food. Smelling pork ribs that would need the knives to be re sharpened thrice before those ribs would be cut. Stale veggies alongside. Carbonara was so shit I could just make pasta on white sauce and it'd be better. And for Christ's sake, who adds capsicum slices to carbonara? 
Service was appreciable, much like the ambience but the only reason I came back here after a year was definitely not the squat I received on the table. 
Very poor Steak Factory. It'd take a million dollar offer or something really out of the box for at least this one customer to head back here.

I tried spaghetti carbonara and barbeque pork ribs which turned out to be big disasters.The pork was not well cooked and there wasn't any taste of barbeque sauce and had a weird odour.The carbonara was just spaghetti in plain white sauce and it had a bland taste.Carbonara had lots of capsicum and was very bad in taste.I would strongly recommend not to try out these dishes.

Allright so this story begins on a nabami afternoon where we 3 hungry fellow end up looking for some proper steaks and got ourselves a fair deal here. We were not interested in olypub anymore and so decided to try this one. 

Ambience: 6/10
This is an old building‚Äôs ground floor turned into a steak shop. Not too good and not too bad. Minimal decoration with some movie poster and soft lights. The sitting was comfy and the place is a bit cozy. Good for couples to have that small lunch session. 

Service: 5/10
we had to wait to get a rable and wait even longer to get the food served. After 45 minutes the food arrived and i was pissed about it but the food completely changed my mood. 

Food: 8/10
The tenderloin stake was well done and it tasted good. The burger was adequate for one person. It was tasty but not out of the world. But the surf and turf stake and barbqued pork ribbs blowed ur heads. It was soo well cooked and the special barbq sauce tasted too good. Definately worth a try.

Overall it was a nice experience. The choice of music was good. The price is a bit on the heavier side and only a few menus justifies it. But the place is worth giving a try.
So this is it guys. If you like my review please like this as that motivates us to write more detailed review in future. Thank you.

It's a small venture having a compact set up. The ambiance is good with a minimalistic decor. The quality of food they serve is good keeping the quantity a lot lesser. Out of all the dishes that we had ordered for, Fish Florentine was really good and the garlic breads were decent and juicy.

I give a thumbs up to the food but thumbs down to the service as I found them a little laid back!

A very small restaurant serving some decent foods.The place is a tiny one. Tables are too small to move your hands properly. But food is good here. We were a group of 6. Our order was : Chilli pork , Bacon wrapped prawn , Cajun spiced fish , Minced Meatball in starter. For main course : Surf & Turf, Fish & Chips , Mixed grill. And to wash down the foods fresh lime soda. All the starters were delicious except minced meatballs as I was getting strong taste of tamarind ( not sure whether 'twas really tamarind or something else ) and some other spice which didn't go well with my taste buds. Bacon wrapped prawn and chilli pork is highly recommended. Cajun spiced fish was also very tasty. In the main Surf & Turf ( buffalo steak served with mashed potato , mushroom sauce , boiled veggies ) was way better than mixed grill and fish & chips. Mixed grill , Fish & Chips both were very average. The mashed potato served with buffalo steak ( surf & turf) was bland , steak was soft not too chewy but I have had tasted better buffalo steak so can't say it was an amazing one but it was good. Enjoyed the starters more than the main course. Price is also moderate. Overall a decent place.

Its a small place on the road, a really small place but I won't actually complain about it. It has a soothing light, nice decor and the food is amazing too. We went in for a quick lunch. We ordered a chicken steak and 2 blue lagoons (yes, my all time favourite - tastiest drink from the Heaven).
The steak was well cooked and juicy and the veggies good will with it. We shared, yet we were almost kind of full (I wouldn't have mind another one though). 
Lovely place. Look forward to visit again.

I heard about this place from many of my friends but never got a chance to be there before. On saptami night we finally got the chance to try some of their mouth watering dishes. Though their menu was limited because of the puja, we ordered chicken ala-kiev , mixed grill, virgin mojito and blue lagoon. The chicken ala-kiev was buttery and delicious. Mixed grill contained chicken, mutton, chicken sausages and grilled vegetables, French fries and was equally tasty. The beverages were not as cold as they should be. But they added extra ice after asking which is fine. All the members and staffs were friendly. I will definitely go there next time to try some of their other dishes. --

Last day of festive lunch destinationüòÇ. Bookmarked this place for a long time. this is an ultimate place for steak. It was Just opposite to mudiali durgapuja actuallyüòÖ. And we didn't notice it even!üòÇ at dasami, we tracked the map and searched for it and found it's location, lolüòã but the place is not so big. It has two sections. Still it's quite short. Specially the two seater tables are too short to place the items üòû. Even when I tried to sit on the chair, I couldn't pull it back because of the other tableüòÖ. Whatever I called a stuff and he managed that issue. But we didn't found any similarities between the Zomato menu and the menu they gave us. Don't know if it was festive special menu or not. 
Ordered one bacon wrapped prawn for starter. For mains we ordered tenderloin steak and ham steak. The bad part was mock tails weren't available üòí. The manager herself came and took the orders. She informed about the unavailability of mocktails. However we were impressed by her behaviour so much.üòç

We waited for 15-20 mins enjoying the decor ‚ù§ . Posters of "Taxi driver" , Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn were there, which we loved lots. They have Pink Floyd in their track collection tooüòç and the other blues they played like hoobstank's the reason , and all blown my mind üòá.
Now come to foods. 
Bacon wrapped prawn - served with a honey dip. That dip was a blockbuster that day ü§§. Bacon wrapped prawn was cooked slowly. Nkt fried. It tasted delicious specially because of the dip. But if it was fried or grilled, could be more delicious.

Ham steak - served with French fries üçü, veggies, and onions. Boiled well. So I could cut it politely. üòÇ it had fats on its both side. 

Tenderloin steak - served with mashed potato, veggies, and onions. A soup was served with it. Tenderloin tasted good. But the same thing I'd like to repeat, It could have been better if it wad fried or grilled. Same thing in case the ham. The both steaks tasted a bit more delicious with that honey dip üçØüòÇ. And one thing, they're less spicy. A bit more spice could be added to it.

Allover we were impressed. A very good place to have steak. Looking forward to have some grills and fries here.

I was not sure about this place at the beginning. But after I ended up visiting this place with my friends I regret my decision not visiting this place earlier. First, the ambience is great with such beautiful music always playing on background. The pricing on the food is reasonable considering the quality of food. And of course the steaks are really good. If I have to mention one flaw that would the serving. The waiters take too much time to serve your plate. But apart from that it's really some place you'd like to visit often.

Went there on saptami. The place was pretty crowded still the staff managed to get us a table within half an hour. The service was quite prompt. The decor was nice and cozy. The usual menu was replaced with a puja special which didn't have many of their specialities.  We had ordered factory mixed grill, chicken steak , tenderloin steak,fish in mixed sauce, chelo kebab and spaghetti carbonara. The taste was pretty decent but we were a little disappointed because we hoped to try the lamb lasagna. The only issue was the quantity and the prices are a little on the higher side. But the quality of the food makes up for it.

As the name suggests, this place is simply amazing for having yummy steaks. They've recently opened a branch at Jadavpur, but we decided to visit this Southern Avenue outlet.

The decoration is pretty much different than most other restaurants. It's quite understandable that they've turned a resident into a restaurant. Hence, this place looks more different and you feel more comfortable and at home having meals here. We ordered Chicken Steak, Grilled Fish Sizzler, Tenderloin Steak and another dish that I cannot remember! The Grilled Fish Sizzler was soooo delicious that we ordered another one in the end! Then we ordered Virgin Mojito for all four of us. 

We were so happy with the dishes we savoured there. Though their service wasn't quick, the yummy dishes held us back from complaining! A must visit place for all steak lovers.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 1000 for two (approx.)

Not too restaurant like feel on offer; seems like carved out of an old school Kolkata place. Oh boy they serve awesome American food. A wonderland for the non veg loving people. The mixed grill had the perfect balance of flavors. The bacon wrapped prawns I thought was a bit too sweet and the bacon could have been a bit more fried to crispy. The best was their steaks. Every element on the chicken steak dish had its role to play and they complimented each other so very perfectly. The poached egg on top was like this is how every steak dish should be served. 
Not the perfect 5 due to the long wait time. Maybe because we visited during Durga pujo. Definitely would like to visit the place after the festivities and rate it 5.

They serve some delicious continental cuisines and the aura of the place gives u a feel of the 80-90s with movie posters of Hollywood actors from the era. The chicken steak is the best one can ever have. For desserts do try the fresh ice-cream rolls. I never had such yummilicious ice-cream rolls with such freshness.

The best place for meat lovers! We visited the place on Asthami and ordered Factory mixed grill, bacon wrapped prawn, chilly spicy pork in starters and Chicken Steak, Factory special cheese ham steak as mains. Considering it was DurgaPuja time it took quiet a while to serve the dishes, however the dishes were awesome. We simply loved the steaks and the factory mixed grill. Would love to visit the place after the Puja rush is over and try the non puja menus on offer.
PS: The hosts were beatuiful. ;)

My friend dragged me into the place on a bustling Saptami afternoon. Frankly, I was pretty impressed by the ambience the moment I stepped inside. If the place didn't already resemble a cosy corner, the staff definitely made us feel more at home. We had ordered Bacon wrapped Prawns for appetizers and lord! - the word amazing is just an understatement. Then came the showstopper - something I would recommend everybody who's into pork - Pork Chops - tender, juicy and I'm not kidding when I say that they actually melted in my mouth.

Located on southern avenue, this place is a good option if you are having steak cravings. We tried two of their dishes - 1) Fish florentine. The smell and the taste was just awesome and the quantity was also sufficient for two. 2) Chicken steak. Was disappointed with this one. The steak was tough and chewy and considering the fact that the name itself has 'steak' in it the food was not at all up to the mark.
Ambiance was too good with soothing music and pictures of hollywood movies and singers. Service was okay.

Even during the overloaded peak hours of pujo, steak factory served sumptuous food. No hiccups. My personal favourites were the fish florentine and the spaghetti carbonara. Only con i could find was that the portions were a bit on the smaller side. Otherwise the hospitality is warm, and the ambience has a rustic old world charm.

Lattice replaced with cabbage in Cesar Salad.
Steak when ordered to be deep roasted came with normal one.
Broccoli replaced with cauliflower.
No sauce or pepper in the table. 
People service customers are very decent and patient, however they tend to forget orders. 
Ambience is good with mostly young crowds. 
I think this might be very puja specific mayhem and it might not be the case for rest of the days in the year. 
.
They if improved little here and there can vastly increase their image. 
My feedback may be biased as I was used too with different taste which once can find in US or Aus. 
The owners might have modified the taste to give importance to local taste.

Visited Steak factory with friends on Saptami afternoon i.e. today itself. The place is too small and even on requesting several times they were unable to provide us an extra chair for a kid along with us. When we explicitly said that it would really be a problem for 5 people to accommodate in a 4 seater, they finally shifted us to a different 4 seater table with an extra seat.

We ordered 2 blue lagoons and 2 lime sodas in drinks. Coming to the food, we had Factory Grilled Fish, Chelo kabab and Stuffed tandoori leg. When the drinks came, we were surprised to see that the lime sodas were of normal room temperature and although the blue lagoons were comparatively cool but missing ice in it. We were left dumbfounded on asking for ice as they said they are out of stock for ice! As a patron, I would expect the server informing me about this right at the time of placing my order and not when the order has arrived on my table. Most importantly, he was least apologetic about this.

From the food side, the Factory Grilled Fish tasted good. The fish was accompanied by saut√©ed veggies and French fries. The Chelo kabab however, had no butter in the rice and same was the case with the rice in Stuffed tandoori leg. We had to ask for butter as the rice was dry and difficult to be gulped down on its own.

We had to ask for cutlery, tissue paper, salt and pepper individually as none of these were present even though the food was served. When asked for the cutlery, one of servers just handed over to me a bundle of spoon, fork and knives without bothering to place those on a side plate. I have heard about restaurants being under-managed during the puja rush time but never expected these basics to be forgotten by a restaurant that has 4.0 average rating on Zomato. I would still give this place a benefit of doubt and would like to try this place once more, NOT during puja but on a regular time and decide whether it's a YAY or a NAY.
 A 2.5 until next time!

The Location : It's situated at a quite and composed place, approximately 4min walk from Rabindra Sarobar Lake's main entrance

The decoration : This is the place where I feel it was really decent! The place is basically and redone classic bengali home! Complete Vintage look thrash your senses once you enter, walls full of retro pictures and portraits, old jazz music running on background. Pretty sidelinely rare as compared to most of restaurants in Kolkata.

Ambience : It's not bad but some element tweaks might make it better.

Food : Ordered---
Ham steak -> It was good! But a bit too hard and chewiness was bit less.
Mixed grill plate -> This plate has different meats in it. Muttons were quite well cooked, sausages were not so well in terms of taste, chicken pieces were worst in this plate.
Virgin Mojito -> Pretty nice and refreshing!

Concluded verdict : This place is good enough to atleast try once and has its own strengths but the food was not as delicious as it looked and the issue here is the price! It's really excessively expensive! All over good place but the price eh..!

The location of this place is good , far from noise and crowd . They converted a residential house to a restaurant , so it‚Äôs a good use of space , as Kolkata have lack of it now a days. Now to the ambience - Hmm, at first it‚Äôs gives you good vibe with some good old movie posters #TaxiDriver and some artist hanging in the wall , Lighting and Decoration is okish. What really turns you down is the music , they play some cover version of Summer of 69 #SorryBryan in a loop and No Jazz or Blues or Rock. #PoorTasteOfMusic . So this place sounds bad . I found no napkin in my table so I asked for it . We ordered Virjin Mojito , Ham Steak and Mixed Grill (Its their Speciality ) , Presentation of the Food is as bad as their taste of music . After finishing my meal I realise that this place food is over priced . I found no special signature in their food , it‚Äôs just cooked with some chilli sauce and served with #AluBhaja (Yes , The French fries taste like homemade AluBhaja) and Veges . I should not recommend it to anyone unless they change their taste music , cutlery set and food . A beautiful lady came to me after I finished my meal and she asked ‚Äú The Food is fine na ? ‚Äú , and I replied ‚Äú Yes , it‚Äôs really good ‚Äú , P.S. I didn‚Äôt want to break her heart so .......

Was lucky to get a place to sit instantly during Pujas.. the staff was efficient and quick.. order was taken quickly and served.. no doubt the food was good and very tasty ! I had a chicken steak and it very delicious. My only complain would remain about their presentation. Food was scattered on the plate. Could have been more organised.

This is my absolute go-to place for any kind of occasion. The food is really good. This place offers a classic American diner sort of feel. You can order almost anything and be satisfied with it.

If you are a steak lover this is the ultimate destination for you..we ordered the chicken steak, spaghetti with meatballs: chicken was tender , juicy and well-cooked. it was really delicious and I  loved it...the spaghetti was creamy and the meatballs were very soft.it was ok.
Now about the dessert :  the caramel custard which was excellent..
Service was very slow.. they really need to upgrade the service.. otherwise it was a good experience... Definitely worth a try..

I had my birthday lunch here today, and it was honestly great! The interiors are very warm and welcoming with some amazing posters and the staff were really friendly and affectionate.
We ordered a Sweet Lime Soda and Virgin Pinacolada for drinks, and for mains, we had a Tenderloin Steak and Bacon Wrapped Prawns. The food was amazing, and very reasonably priced!!
I'll definitely come here for a quick lunch or so in the future!!

Setting up an old house to what it is now - must be easy job . The so called bacon wrapped steak was little blunt ,specially the sauce was very blunt. Bacon wraps r felt like sun-dried with grams of salt . 
By the way they ran out of chicken and fish .
The restroom iran out of water as well :(

The drinks are good but considering the name the chicken steak was a let down. Unlike red meat, a rare or a medium rare chicken is just raw or under cooked chicken. Prawn stuffed squid was rubbery with extreme lack of flavour and prawns.
All in all a very disappointing experience!!!

Visited this place today with a lot of expectations in my mind. Went to the southern avenue outlet, but was thoroughly disappointed! The place is small and cozy, has a nice old Calcutta feel, but the ambience was way too dull. Coming to the food we ordered crispy calamari and tenderloin steak. None of it tasted good, the steak was still okayish. Just okayish. Compared to the price the quantity wasn't good enough. The service was horrible. Just horrible! They themselves don't know the menu, you have to ask them to serve you water, they didn't even serve us plates to eat till we asked for it. Weird! Just had this much and left. Was disgusted. Not going back again. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :( Sad with the experience

I visited this outlet after being to its erstwhile branch at Salt Lake, with expectations set accordingly. Apparently, they were set too high.
The choice of music is good. The decor is nice. However, when 4 people sit at the 4-seater table, it might get a little crowded.
The staff is helpful no doubt, but not really that alert and agile.
Coming to the food: The bacon wrapped prawn was simply a small piece of prawn (not even the whole eatable part of it) wrapped in rolls of bacon FAT. While this may appeal to some, we couldnt help but feel a little cheated. The chicken steak might have been a bit more tender.
Other than this, we found the food to be merely okay üôÑ.

The place was small, however the ambience and decor was nice. The waiters were friendly. But the main dish -  chicken steak and tenderloin steak wasn't great. The chicken steak was tough and the tenderloin steak was chewy and somewhat bland. Overpriced for the quality they serve. The only good thing was the dessert, the chocolate brownie with hot chocolate and ice cream was awesome and even the caramel custard. But I feel the place should check upon it's quality, potentially can be a good place with a few amendments.

Great place to dine-out with your friends! 
We tried the Ham Steak, Grilled Fish Sizzler(Basa), Cheesy Potato and Bacon Casserole.. satisfied with both the quality and quantity. Food was tasty up to the mark.. and for dessert, we had Caramel Custard..was so-so. 

Would have rated 5 but some dishes we wanted to order, were not available. 
If you are planning to go there, Ham Steak is something you should definitely look out for. :)

My visit to Steak factory was kind of on a whim. I had never read any reviews about the place or planned ahead or anything. The place is a little smaller than what I expected but not bad at all. It is rather cozy. Ambience is alright. And well, the main thing, the food. The food is amazing. It's quite economic and the quality is superb. We had chicken steak, chicken tikka pizza, factory mixed sizzler, virgin pinnacolada and blue lagoon. Everything was amazing. I am definitely going back.

Visited the joint with friends and noticed that the menu card was torn and was held together by an exam board..As they say ..The morning shows the day..Ordered the mixed grill which was served shortly ..Contained the most inexpensive meat(chicken) in abundance and small pieces of slightly stale mutton and thankfully only 2 peices of soggy prawns..Covered in a red ragu..The entire meal tasted as poor as it looked..The fresh lime soda was the brightest spot of the outing..The staff is courteous..But that does little for ones taste buds.

We were in the mood to try out some continental food...so decided to check out this restaurant in lane near Southern Avenue this Independence Day evening for dinner...

AMBIENCE (3.5/5) :-
Ground floor of an old house has been converted into a Retro look restaurant with 90s music playing in the background...with lot of Hollywood film posters & funny quotes about Steaks stuck on the walls.
But the Washroom calls for improvement.

FOOD :-
1) Bacon Wrapped Prawn (4/5) :- The bacon coating on prawns with grated cheese was good. Prawns were of good size...

2) Chicken Ala-Kiev (3/5) :- The molten butter flowed out properly on cutting with a knive... But for the price of Rs.390/- we had expected it to be of a bigger size... Or may be two of the size which was provided... Its completely over priced.

3) Factory Mixed Grill (4/5) :- This Sizzler was the best among the dishes we had ordered. Good in taste with good quantity of meat, prawns, veggies & fries.... A value for money dish. U can have this alongwith Garlic Bread.

4) Garlic Bread (2/5) :- It was served cold... It became quite tough by the time we had it...

SERVICE (3/5) :-
Cordial staffs but they didn't seem to have proper coordination among themselves.
Although we had requested them to serve us the dishes one at a time so that we could have enough time to share and njoy the meal but they served all the dishes together... Which made it difficult for us to share as the food turned cold.

Overall a good joint to satiate ur continental appetite...but definitely needs improvement to star among the best in the lot...

Trust me the taste of the food here is just not worth the pocket pinch.We had the chicken sizzler , fish and chips and monte carlo. 
The chicken sizzler was just full of veggies with a lean long piece of chicken and a wierd tasting sauce and french fries. It really did not taste good and is not worth the pocket pinch.
Fish and chips tasted fine.
And the cake used in monte carlo also tasted wierd and is really just not worth. Will definitely never visit thia place again.

If you are looking for a restaurant that provides great food along with a peaceful ambience, then this restaurant would be your one if the first choices for sure. It is little bit hard to locate but the quality of the food items justifies that effort. We had Chicken Steak and Chicken Sizzler and both are just finger-licking awesome. We even had Prawn wrapped with bacon and that too wasn't that bad. RECOMMENDED.

The ambience is pretty darn good. Even the washrooms have a theme, in this case the popular American sitcom, Friends. That's really cool. 

Coming to the food, we had bacon wrapped prawns for starters which had six servings. It is quite a generous amount of food for a starter, otherwise it was delicious. Though I certainly believe my bacon should have been more crispy.

The virgin mojito s were nothing above usual but nice.

I genuinely wanted to have a tenderloin steak but decided against it after having the bacon. I opted for a minced mutton and a chicken steak instead. They were pretty good but I still think the mutton could do with a bit more sauce as it was dry. The chicken on the other hand oozed juices but that is what they naturally do. The fries were according to my liking and the broth was good. 

I would have liked to taste the live ice cream but it was unfortunately unavailable so I had the caramel custard instead which was really nice. Not too sweet and Kept sliding of my spoon which is just perfect!!

Pocket pinch - Rs. 1700. Pretty decent considering the quality of food on table. A must visit surely!! Great job to the whole team!

Located in southern avenue... a cool place for dinner, good taste of food and proper pricing of food
The main reason I went there is to try their tenderloin steak that I could not getA .5 less rating because they were out of mutton on that day and they could not serve tenderloin steak..which is not expected on a Saturday night

The thing that needs special mention is the dessert Chocolate Monte Carlo...a must try... even though you have to wait for 30 minutes for them to prepare
                    

P.S: I am reviewing bit late and hence, missing food names

I had heard a lot about The Steak Factory. So my friends and I dropped by. The location is odd. It's confusing and without GPS it is hard to locate. 
The place was empty when we arrived. 
The ambiance is ok, the service is slow here. The staff needs to be attentive. 
What we ordered, Tenderloin Burger, Barbeque Pork Ribs, Squid Calamari, Shirley Temple ( the drink) and Fresh lime soda. 
The Squid Calamari was a DISASTER, I have had squid Calamari at several places and by far this was the worst. The batter was bad, like over fried Pakoras. The squid was hard and rubbery and I doubt if it was fresh. 
The Barbeque Pork Ribs was decent, it was well seasoned. The vegetables and fries tasted just fine. 
The STAR of the show was without a doubt the Tenderloin Burger. Excellent. The patty was well done, the meat was good. Loved it. You shouldn't miss this if you go to The Steak Factory. 
They should improve the quantity it's very less, some of the above mentioned mains and starter. You can visit this place only and only for the Burger! Otherwise it is a disappointment.

The decor and music selection also contributing towards a great dining experience. We walked out the restaurant feeling content.

The Steak Factory is the ultimate destination for any steak lover. This outlet is located 2 mins off southern avenue (use map if you are not a regular to this area as it can be a bit difficult to locate it). The ambience is serene. No music or extravaganza yet beautiful. Staff courteous an service time is pretty good. Now coming to the food part. Forget about your diet and straightaway order the "bacon wrapped prawns" if you are not allergic to any specific item. The bacon coating on prawns with grated cheese on top would take you on a fairytale ride. Comig to the main course they have steaks and sizzlers of everything you can think of and having tried most of them in my numerous visits, I can assure you, there will not be any disappointment. Add to that the lamb lasagna , a good portion of minced lamb floating in a sea of melted cheese.The brownie ice cream with hot chocolate sauce would be a perfect way to end your meal. Pricing unimaginably reasonable. Overall a must visit place if you are a steak/sizzler lover.

As an ardent meat lover The Steak Factory was on my checklist for a long time. Finally I visited this outlet on a Sunday Evening. Though the location was a bit difficult for a north resident, the vintage look actually reminds us of North Kolkata's signature old architecture. Coming to food we took Cajun Fish Fry and Mozzarella stuffed chicken fingers as starters. Fish fry was melting in our mouth and hot and spicy sauce made it 'a dish to remember'. Chicken fingers were crispy and had adequate cheese within it. Then we took classic Mac n cheese adding chicken into it and tenderloin steak. Though Mac n cheese was creamy and perfect, tenderloin steak was a bit hard. The bill didn't hurt our pocket and thumbs up for giving mineral water on MRP.

The steak factory is a small little diner styled restaurant tucked into a small lane. Easy to miss but the food however is not. The place with one of the best beef steaks in kolkata and that makes amazing burgers. But, the real show stealer has to be the grilled fish sizzler. The creamy taste leaves an after taste that is simple irresistible and impossible to forget. The pork ribs in barbeque sauce is also a delight. Definitely worth the bucks.

Tucked into a little lane off Southern Avenue, Steak Factory is the ideal place for carnivores on a budget. I visited this place with a few friends to try out some of their specialities. The place is small and with the 90s music in the background and posters of James Dean and John Denver among others gave this place a very retro feel. Although, I felt the place to be a tad too small considering the number of tables which made it feel more crowded than it actually was.

Anyways, coming to the food. Ironically, none of us ordered steak and stuck to non-beef mains. We ordered a factory mixed grill, baked chicken ala napolitana, lamb lasagna and pulled pork burger. The mixed grill was okayish, with its generous mix of chicken, veggies and fries. The napolitana was lovely, with perfectly cooked chicken, a moreish sauce and a soft pillowy egg underneath. The lasagna however was a huge disappointment, the heavy-handed use of white sauce with hardly any trace of tomato ruined the dish completely. The dish of the day however was the pulled pork burger. Bits of pork, onions and bell pepper, bursting with flavour between two pieces of bread with fried on the side. It was one of the better burgers I have had in the city.

We were looking forward to dessert, in particular the live icecream and raspberry cheesecake. However we were informed that the only desserts available were the apple pie and the brownie. We were a little disappointed and decided to order those two. The apple pie was way too dominant in its cinnamon flavour and the pastry was not crisp all the way around. The chocolate brownie was delicious and gooey, more like a fondant than an actual brownie. However the consistency of the ice cream, which accompanied both desserts was appalling. It had melted completely leaving behind a sweet foam on the plate which looked and tasted more like whipped cream than ice cream. The hot brownie in particular was desperately crying out for some ice cream to contrast the temperature, and the desserts failed precisely due to that one glaring detail.

Service was very slow and it took forever for the mains to reach our table. However, having said that, this place has excellent value for money. They have several offers which makes it a very pocket-friendly place to go to. Overall, I was more or less satisfied with the experience, but I really wish they worked on some of the dishes just a bit more.

For health-consious people having sizzlers or steaks can be considered a good option on the cheat days or when the stomach is craving for some spice but the calories too need to be counted ! So after doing a little bit of research i visited steak factory,lake place since sizzlers r a hot-favourite and have heard a lot about this place.Tried the mixed grill sizzler and chicken steak both of which tasted good,was presentable enough and also fair enough quantity to satisfy one person.Fresh lime soda at the end was also quite apetizing.The blend of soda and lime was nice.Good service.Has quite a varied menu card.Overall good choice of continental cuisine.

The food was nice and quite filling. We ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Parmigiana, Vegetable Risotto and 3 cheese pizza as complimentary dish. Happy hour meal. For drinks we had simple virgin mojito. With the cosy ambience, the food was good.

I had food from here several times and each and every time it rocked. The cottage cheese beef steak is awesome. It is very soft,juicy and delicious. The tenderloin is also very juicy and good. The ham burger was wonderful and perfect. The chelow kabab is also pretty good. I also had many other steaks and they were all good. So if you go for steak ,it's steak factory.

Food is good. Rasonable price. But serving time is too much late. Fast it up. People have to have a lot of time just to have the starter. While ordering tell your daily offers and daily specials.

Had a meet up with a friend in this smallish joint tucked away in a quaint little lane just by Sarovar. 

We ordered the Tenderloin steak, medium done and a Mac and Cheese. The Steak a bit too rare for me, with considerable effort required to separate each small bite. That being said, the gravy and the veggies provided with it make it a good experience. The Mac and Cheese was absolutely heavenly, creamy and melting. 

Well behaved staff and good food make this one a must visit. If only they could add a few more tables..

Just 5-7 mins away from Rabindra Sarovar Lake,this place serves yummy Steaks and lasagna.I have visited this place more than once and 'am a fan of Chicken Lasagna, Chicken Steak,Ham Steak.
Pork Ribs and Tenderloin steak are equally good.None of the dishes or the contents have ever disappointed me.They are very healthy.
Had the service been a bit quick,I will be more than happy :)

Stupendous delicacy with an intriguing ambience gets this zone a more preferable one. Again, the unique variety of food styles served with contemporary bits and eloquent continental flavors turns on the best way to endure more customers.

The place is nicely situated in an alley in a quiet cosy neighborhood with the signboard saying DINER sticking out, giving it the American steakhouse/diner feeling.
Stepping into the place I notice only 3-4 tables , all occupied, quickly disheartening me. BUT then the manager introduces us into the inner dining hall.
The bamboo lanterns dangling from above, I look around in wonder at the red walls adorned with framed posters of movies and songs from the 70's. It seemed like  movie paradise for a film buff and audiophiles - Johnny Cash looking at you , accompanied by Django slinging a gun at you.
The restaurant space is not small but not overwhelmingly large too. The room is outfitted with tables all adorned with nice table mats. But the place is not at all stuffy and formal.
Ambience and decor is a total 5 on 5.
We ordered the following:
* Pork Chop
* Ham Steak
* Factory Mixed Grill
* Chicken Steak

* Pork Chop:
Huge, tender, flavorful, this pork chop is a huge cut of meat, carved nicely.  Succulent and sweet as it was , I really didn't even need a knife. The meat melts in the mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes with some steamed vegetables on the side, all excellent and nicely arranged on the plate.It is undoubtedly the best pork chop I ever had. 

*Ham Steak:
We asked for medium rare and it was more like medium. The ham steak was nice and large bearing some nice grill marks, and embedded some of that barbecue and other sauces into it that just made it taste even better. The steak was cooked perfectly to order - tasty & tender.

* Factory Mixed Grill
The Factory Mixed Grill is the second thing after the steak, that that really made a lasting impression on me. I had never before experienced so many different types of cooked meat on one plate and it felt so tempting.
The mixed grill came with sausages, shredded grilled chicken -all smoky and fine. Served with small portion of French Fries,the mixed grill contains grilled vegetables as well, which work well on the grill and enhance the flavors of what might otherwise just be a big pile of shredded meat.
I suppose they could have added baby corn to the grill as well, since it's supposed to be one of the main constituents of an all American mixed grill.

*Chicken Steak
I will keep it short over here. I believe that steaks always are made on red meat. I did taste it but it is nowhere near a ham or buff steak. Anyone who has tasted either of the red meat steaks would know what I'm talking about. A full score for their preparation though.

In all , The Steak Factory is a throwback to a different era. Nice service and classic steakhouse fare.

This place is a must visit when my dear ones are in town. The food is exactly you desire for after looking at the menu. I am a repeat customer of this outlet and have been more than satisfied after every visit.
My all time favorite dish is spaghetti and meat balls.
The service is good, just the time factor has to be taken care of.
Happy and stuffed tummy is what i feel all the time :)

One of the best steaks in town. One reason I have love hate relationship with this place is that they don't serve beer. However if you see there is a reason to that. Without alcohol you actually get the taste of the meat which is normally occuled by alcohol at other places.  I really enjoyed every bite and every dip of the sause. I come here again and again and it's a pleasure.

What caught my eyes as soon as I entered this small 'cute' cafe located in a bylane near Mudiali are the quirky posters they had all over the place. Hollywood film posters-- Woody Allen's Manhattan, Woody Allen himself, ol' westerns; and then there's funny quotes about steak or food in general. The music was also going with the mood. Perfect setting for a chat over good food. And oh lord, the food was good indeed!
We ordered for Chicken Cordon Bleu, Tenderloin Steak, Bacon wrapped Steak and got a Pork pulled Burger for free which added to our delight. Each of the dishes were cooked to perfection, had got big portions to fill up at once. Most of the times what disappoints us are if the usual dishes like lasagne or Cordon Bleu or fish n chips for that matter aren't done as they are traditionally. But they hadn't‚Äã done a thing wrong. Other than these we had desserts -- Brownie with Ice Cream, Caramel Custard, Monte Carlo-- yes, the usual. They didn't have Rhaspberry Cheese Cake which we badly wanted. Poor us! :( Maybe next time.
Honestly, the desserts weren't able to leave behind any mark on an otherwise awesome experience. Will definitely come back to try the other steaks and dishes. Only, you guys need to work on your sweet tooth menu. Rest are just perfect. Keep on raisin' the 'steaks' ;)

It's a very small and cozy place.. beautiful location and an amazing ambience. Great music playlist. 
Their bacon wrapped prawns is to die for. 
And so is the pizza bolognese. Such a beautiful mouth fulfilling topping is very hard to come by. 
The bacon wrapped steak was cooked to perfection and the plate was a beauty to the eyes. 
Very affordable ranges. 
A perfect friends and chat destination, right in the heart of Southern Avenue.

This place is a small room converted into a well decorated 70's restaurant. Very small accommodation but they made that up with the well decorated 70's theme painting in wall and with blues playing in background. This place shoud be in the wishlist of steak lovers. 

Well beahved staffs, prompt and fast serving of food. Steaks are well cooked and found them very tasty. Also they were running a happy hour offer where you get the 4th main-course free on ordering 3 main-course. So overall it was a fun experience.

I'd heard quite a lot about this place. All my friends had been here at least once. So I thought I'd give it a go. I expected it to be a bigger place, though.
We ordered -
1. Blue Lagoon- A standard tangy drink for a hot day.
2. Chicken steak- It came with gravy and fries and veggies, and topped with an egg. I thinked the steak could have been prepared better. But it was fine.
3. Chicken stroganoff - Rice tasted fine, a tad overcooked perhaps. The chicken tasted good.
4. Apple pie with ice cream- Tasted good, but the pie crust was a bit thick. 

Service was fine, but the food took quite some time to arrive.

With respect to the portions served it is quite expensive.
We tried the Chicken grilled steak..the steak was juicy and well prepared. The veggies served as sides was fresh too.
The Mutton Pot roast: the mutton pieces were not soft enough. It tasted like stew so otherwise it was okay.
The cafe has a lot of options for steak at least a one time visit is recommended if you like meat n chicken.
The Wi-Fi worked well enough.
Service was fine.
Ambience; good enough.

I am a bit late for this review. We were 3 friends there last Sunday (i.e. 11.06.2017) for dinner.

1. Ambiance: Small but cozy. Musics were a bit loud for that small place. Tables were enough lit.

2. Food: We ordered Chicken Wings as starter, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Factory Special Ham Steak, Factory Special Chicken Steak and Virgin Mojito. I'd say all of those items were really yummy. Specially the Ham Steak was great. I personally prefer steak fry potatoes with steak but it was also OK with french fries. This is also my personal view, that, when you are taking orders for any drinks, I think it would be nice if you ask if someone needs ice in that or not. I never take ice in my soft drinks. So I had to ask them again to take out ice cubes from my drink. Otherwise everything else was nice.

3. Staffs: Staffs were courteous. I was there for the first time, so I asked them for their suggestions, they suggested all of those foods for us. Service was quite prompt. 

4. Price: Frankly speaking, a little bit overpriced for the quantity. I say again, a little. 

So finally my overall experience about The Steak Factory is : Very Good. I recommend this restaurant to others. I'll definitely go again with my family.

I loved the decoration of the place. Mainly the washroom, it was so motivating. 
The place offers a good variety of stakes; pork, lamb and chicken. And I said before, lots of posters and songs from 70's blues will lift your mood up.
I tried Chicken ala-kiev and chicken roasted pizza. 
Ala Kiev was too good to share but as the quantity is also as per, I had to. Chicken roasted pizza was cheesey, and it had a wood-burn smell. Though I love the smell, some people may find otherwise.
Overall,this place is one of the good restaurants for meat lovers in south Kolkata.

Disclaimer:-¬†

I ate a delicious lunch at The Steak Factory Lake Place, when I was in Kolkata in May, for a short holiday. This writeup has been pending a long time, and even though it was penned down at the time itself, it has been modified over time.

The Steak Factory Lake Place:-

I am not the one to care for decor. Usually, the last thing that interests me about any place is the way it looks honestly. But, as soon as I entered this homely restaurant, aesthetically painted in earthy shades, I felt hungrier, thanks to the instant familiarity.
The decor made me feel at home, increasing my appetite immediately.¬†

I did not order starters, and instead went straight for the pork chops.
2 massive chops, on a plate, covered with the most delectable looking gravy, which seemed to be seeping in and out and around the slabs of meat and fat, arrived on a plate, with fries, vegetables and onion rings.

The chops themselves, are a sight to behold, covered in lush, dropping sauce. I don‚Äôt know what goes into the sauce but it‚Äôll cure whatever food pangs you have ever had.¬†
Cutting into the meat reveals a well cooked slab, no doubt one of the best cuts. The proportion of meat:fat is just perfect (for those who love pork, you know how vital this is). The fat is crisp and delightful on the outside. Go beneath the surface to discover the most melt-in-the-mouth layer you‚Äôll ever taste.¬†

The meat, is prepared with care, it is evident. Striated and pink, it makes for a delicious combination with the gravy. Biting into it gives evidence of its tenderness, and the juices and flavours dance in your mouth, while you chew.

The cutlery was quickly discarded, and I went full feral on the plate after about ten minutes.
The quantity is belly-filling, the taste, exquisite.

The vegetables get an honourable mention.The fries were great, but the onion rings were really delicious.

Washed all this down with a Coke.

All this while being surrounded by some of the nicest decor I've seen, in a long time. No ¬†chandeliers and fluff, there are some nice frames containing some tasteful and very interesting artwork.

Well, there‚Äôs one interesting one ‚ÄúKeep Calm and Eat Steak‚Äù.¬†
Well, for sure, because after eating a meal like that I was so full, and calm, content and well, couldn't really move, for a bit.

What an afternoon.Will always remember.

Food is no chicanery, nor any flippant stuff, it is ¬†serious business and any kind of euphemistic white lie can not be wished away. STEAK means T-bone, Sirloin and big heavy chunk and is typically a BEEF stuff. I find in the menu crab, prawn and chicken, even pork is no steak. This is highly deplorable to use alibis and subterfuges trying to substitute the real thing with fakes.

I had been to the Steak Factory outlet in New Alipore a couple of times when I stayed there. I have always been a fan of their food, specially the pasta. This time I tried out the Southern Avenue outlet. The place was cosy with a beautiful ambiance. We ordered lemon iced tea, mohito, minced mutton steak and a mixed sizzler. The food lived upto the expectations. The mutton was juicy. Sizzler had nice flavours to it. The mohito tasted more like lemonade was we didn't mind. The apple pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the perfect end to a beautiful evening.

Went with a friend for dinner to steak factory as I was craving for some good meat.. and was hugely disappointed ... I ordered a cheese beef steak medium done.. it was the worse steak I have ever had....it was hard.. no texture..no juice..! Nothing at all..absolutely pathetic... the service was quite good though...I guess Kolkata doesn't know how a steak should really taste..saying so coz I have heard good things about this place before I finally found out how really it is!

This has been a go to place for my Oriental hunger pangs for the past couple of years. Visited it last week with my gf and her friends. We ordered spicy meat balls, chicken sausage (prawn crackers were not available) as starters. Pina Colada, virgin mojito and lemonade for drinks. For main dish we had mixed grill, grilled chicken and chicken steak. The meat balls were delectable. In drinks virgin mojito only made the cut. I loved the gravy of grilled chicken. Majority of desserts of steak factory are bland so we opted for different place. The ambience needs a re-jig(it's very cramped also they don't let you sit in the next spacious room generally) , also the wash room needs renovation. With

Had been thinking to visit this place for such a long time. Their steaks are quite hyped and talked about. And rightly so I must say. We ordered mutton steak, factory special mixed sizzler, and cheese garlic bread. And Oh My God! All the items were so awesome. The mutton steak was so soft and juicy and tasteful. The cheese garlic bread, never thought I would love bread so much. The decor was very cool and the waiters were friendly and helpful. Definitely would love to visit again.

The restaurant is small and cozy and gives a very homely ambience.
The food is amazing.
As we all know the steak factory is famous for their steaks but what I loved the most was their dessert.
Chocolate Monte Carlo.
The staff however needs to improve on their communication skills.

Comfortable ambience..humble hospitality even with the last order of the day... Rock cafe interiors...good old music to cheer you up...
Calamari was fried crispy though a little chewy....dip was good companion....
Chicken cocktail sausages were slighty underweight for this bout... Though they somehow made it because they are nicely prepped in oil.
About Rib eyeTenderloin steak....nice cut...seasoned well...cooked to perfection for a medium rare..nor chewy... The potato mash its always a good companion with the bbq sauce.
Cheese tenderloin steak was almost the same....with just a cheese slice baked on top..so not much to say about it... Could have done better
The sizzler was the the full house...with a lot to munch....looked good..tasted good too with good seasoning...meat...eggs...veggies...perfect sizzle..
And the mojito was a soothing companion...not a brilliant overpowering flavour bought to life just like most of the trending restaurants in kolkata...so full marks to mojito..

Overall.. Good experience...because we visited the placed at 10.00pm which was the last order of the restaurant... People serving we're helpful and knew probing...serving time was perfect..let's say within 25 minutes for a steak...starters we're served earlier...
So yeah... Nice play to play party with your friends even if you plan for a late dinner

Went here a a month or so back. The ambience isn't much to boast of and the staff was really friendly.
We ordered bacon wrapped prawn and crispy fried calamari as starters, both of which were absolutely mind blowing. Especially the bacon wrapped prawn, which I'd suggest anyone coming here to try. The juicy bacon and the scrumptious prawn make a deadly combination.
For the main course, we ordered Mac and cheese, Ham Steak, Pork Chops, and Barbecue Pork Ribs. I had the pork ribs, which were weirdly not pork ribs at all, rather a solid chunk of meat, not that I don't appreciate that, but don't get the advertising wrong. The barbecue sauce was a little overpowering and extremely sweet but that's acceptable. The ham steak was absolutely brilliant and was the best among what we had ordered. The pork chops had really low fat content and that's always an added bonus. Didn't try the Mac and cheese.
Well, I had heard great things about this joint, but it didn't live up to the standard for me. Don't get me wrong, it's in no way bad, rather quite good actually, with a vast selection of dishes.
I'd like to visit again to improve my opinion about the place.

This is a very popular joint and not much is left for me to add. I tried this place today and my experience was really great. We ordered- chicken steak, ham steak, cheese garlic bread and cocktail sausage.
The chicken steak was by far the best I had in a long time. The garlic bread is a major disappointment in most places but here it is so good that you will keep going back for more. If you want a heavier steak, go for the ham steak. Also, the ambience is cosy and you will feel comfortable through the meal. So do visit if you haven't already and do go back if you  have. I know I will. Thumbs up! :)

Located in Southern‚Äã Avenue this restro looks more like a house by its First Look... The ambience is good though, with a soft music playing around...Coming to the food , its quite good. We tried  Grilled Fish Steak, Chilly Pork & Fish Florentine. All of the items were quite commendable.But steak being the speciality of this place , I dint find it to be a top notch item. The price is a tad high and a bit overpriced for a few items. But I would still recommend to visit this place.

We were searching for a place to eat nearby Rabindra Sarovar when zomato located this place. We thought to give a try and it was one of the best places. The restaurant is set up at the ground floor of a house and tastefully decorated. We ordered mixed grilled steak and one veg dish for our vegetarian friend. Both the  dishes were cooked to perfection.  I loved tge steak which had a combination of chicken, mutton, pork and mushroom. Baby corn, asparagus and different veggies were also added to it. Though we  had to wait for bit long (may be because our stomach was churning so much that we felt like that üòã) but the dish was lip smacking. 

I liked the clean ambience,  dimly lit but not dark with soft music at the background.

I had been to this place to check their steaks. Apart from steaks they have good variety of offerings to satisfy various gestronomic desires. I ordered tenderloin steak with boiled veggies and mashed potato. The steak has good taste ,medium softness but very juicy. The quantity of veggies could be little more. A small yet neat and tidy place for Indian style stake lovers. The stuffes were well behaved but could be little more engaging with customer service than attending personal phone calls. Over all more than just good. Not excellent yet.

Tasted chicken sizzler and caramel custard.The sizzler could have been much better.It actually a disappointment after having sizzlers at Peter cat.The caramel custard was lovely and thus ended up having 2.The pocket pinch is on the higher side.

The food was tasting good.. both of what I ordered.
1. Chicken Parmigiana
2. Lamb Ragout
Definitely both the above were steak dishes.
Chicken was delicious.. but lamb was undercooked..
Although every other aspect of both the dishes were great. 
1 notable point.I took a takeaway.
The delivery staff was really spontaneous but the cashier was dreaded as he is been forced to be behind the counter. Go home fella if ain't wanting to do the job..

What we ordered:
Starter:
Chilly pork:It was well cooked and delicious. 
Main course:
Chicken Cordon Bleu:The best savory dish of the evening. It had both ham and chicken and French fries. It had some veggies too though they were not at all tasty. 
Ham Steak :Probably the weakest dish. It also had the aforementioned French fries and veggies. The steak was good but we had some difficulty cutting into it and not at all great. 
Desert:
Chocolate Monte Carlo :It's a dish which had a chocolate base and chocolate syrup. It was delicious and was quite filing too. 
Overall the experience was good. The ambience and the time of serving the food were very good though it's quite a small place. Would want to go back there sometime and try other steaks which I hope will be better than this.

Had always heard of the place but never been there until today.. To begin with, the food is sumptuous! Great taste..well presented(this is a major factor for me as a foodie hence m mentioning it) üëç
The ambience is lovely..perfect decor..perfect music.
The service is a bit slow but it hardly matters when the music, food and ambience is so good üòú you can just chill and buy a few more minutes to yourself amidst awesomeness üòÄ
Highly recommended for people of all age.. Great place to chill..great food to taste! üôå

Went to this place yesterday afternoon. It had an offer going on which said by ordering 3 main course dishes we get 1 main course free. We wanted to avail the offer. For starters, we ordered spicy chilli pork was tasted really good. Amazing! For main course we had chicken steak, ham steak, chicken reshmi cheese kebab and Factory mixed grill which is the speciality here. The dishes that stood out were ham steak and chicken cheese kebab. Overall a nice place.

This is the best place for steak through out Kolkata.
Location is good. I did not focus on ambience when I had this awesome delicious Beef Steak. Well the price is not too much for this type of cuisine. And also the quality of food is very good here.
Our group ordered tenderloin steaks, chicken steaks, american fish steak and apple pie with ice cream. Enjoyed the food.

The mark of a good steak house is determined by the quality of its steaks. Sadly, this place creates a high premise with its menu, and falls deeply into the depths of bad cuisine. When we went today there were two offers on display: 
1. Buy 3 main course dishes and get 1 free.
2. Buy 2 desserts and get 1 free.

We two meat lovers went to this place, and wanted to avail the first offer on the main course. So we started with steaks. We had plans to order a Meat Ball dish and a Lasagna after that. We ordered a bacon wrapped beef steak and a bacon wrapped ham steak. 
The beef steak had 2 slices of bacon (so much for being "wrapped") and two peices of ugly looking steak. The ham steak had tender meat topped with a sauce and two slices of bacon (again, so much for being "wrapped"). 
The ham steak was so-so. It was soft and tasty but had a smell that I don't associate with good ham.  

The beef steak however was a nightmare. It was done medium well as it had a slight pinkish Color in the middle. But man it was so tough. I've never had such tough beef. The steak knife was doing no harm to it and I had to use a pulling action with the fork to take it apart bit by bit. Like I said, there were 2 pieces of steak, and the second piece was Well Done and had a terrible smell coming out of it, almost as if it had started rotting. I don't know under what conditions the animal died, but this piece of meat smelled like poop. I almost puked it out. The accompaniments were good, including the mushroom sauce. 

The bad experience with the steaks broke our hearts and we didn't even want to avail the offer now. 

Verdict:  Not the best place to have your steak. Will I go again? Probably not.

The place is located in a cosy neighbourhood of southern avenue . Opposite marble place hotel. The beef steak tasted excellent way better than oly pubs. They have awesome set of mojitos which taste petty good. The only negtv point is the AC is not enough for full house. The prices are very reasonable. A bigger floor area was much desired.

The very first thing that comes to my mind when I start reviewing this place is that my faith in Zomato ratings (which till date had been unquestioning) made me feel stupid for the first time.Have never felt this bad for spending on food.We ordered spicy mutton meatballs for the starters which was the only good thing by the sheer grace of God it seems.the blue lagoon that I ordered was green in colour.the tenderloin steak was undercooked and tough and I had to struggle throughout,the mashed potato lacked any salt in it.We were glad to know that we visited the restaurant during the happy hours,owing to which they offered us a complimentary pizza which was awfully sweet.My friends ordered chicken Tetrazzini and Fish Florentine,both of which were quite bland and inappropriately cooked it seemed as we've tasted such things in other places as well.the caramel custard was again good,if not extraordinary.Moreover,the waiters had to be continuously reminded of serving water.On the whole,I felt the place is overhyped and extremely overpriced,which would be justified if the food was worth it,which clearly it wasn't.

We tried this place with a lot of expectations as it has a 4 rating on Zomato, but we were sorely disappointed. I have nothing against the staff or the ambiance, but the food was not at all worth it. We ordered Spicy meat balls as the starter and that was good. After that, we ordered a tenderloin steak, a chicken tetrazzini, fish florentine and BBQ meat pizza. The steak was undercooked and tough, my friend almost fought with it. The pizza had a weird sweet taste and the toppings were falling off. The fish florentine was bland and the chicken tetrazzini had big pieces of onion, so I didn't get any other taste. The custard pudding that we ordered as desert was okay-ish. ¬†The fresh lime soda was okay, but the blue lagoon was green (imagine that)!! We could not eat half the food, we did not even want to pack it up. The real shocker was the bill, which came to over Rs. 2000 for 3 people, despite the happy hours, where they gave 2 items to us for free. I wouldn't mind it if the food was remotely good, but it wasn't. Of course, you can't visit a restaurant just for its meatballs!

This is a good place to try out a different variety of food we normally don't get in mainstream restaurants. A wide array of choices from a seemingly delicious menu. I went here with my brother and at first the space looked a bit small but is quite comfy. We first had ordered BBQ Pork Ribs and chicken steak. The chicken steak was well cooked and quite satisfactory but the Pork Ribs disappointed me. The taste was good but the pork was not at all tender. I had a hard time trearing it off the bones. A few more hours on the barbecue would have done wonders to this dish. Next up was Chicken Mozzarella sticks and Baked Ham in Cheese. The baked ham was good with a well cooked and flavoured ham along with a flavourous cheese. But again, the sticks let me down. The coating of the fries were too thick due to which the mozzarella within stayed in its solid form and didn't get melted like it should have. We were chewing on hard, solid mozerella with no flavour whatsoever. All in all a bitter sweet experience. One can try out this place for sure and if you're lucky enough you'll get all your orders in a well cooked manner. But, I quite highly recommended it for the "hatke" choice of delicacies.

Was in a mood to have some tenderloin steak, and I was in a hurry so this place was the nearest which serves tenderloin steak. I took parcel. While waiting for my parcel, I did a quick reiki of the place, it has nice feel ample sitting space, the staffs are very nice and well mannered. The packing was good they gave everything in separate containers, the steak was really juicy and I loved it, will surely visit again for the aka carte experience.

So this place was on my bucket list for a long time and I had decided to take my friends here for my birthday treat. ¬†About 10 mins walk from the Rabindra Sarovar Metro station ¬†we located this place with the help of Google Maps. Although it has a slightly offbeat location, it is one of the finest steak houses in Kolkata and lives upto its name " STEAK FACTORY". The menu card was framed and innovative with a variety of choosing options. For the starters we had ordered " Crispy Fried Calamari" and " Bacon wrapped prawns" and they were simply amazing. The Bacon wrapped prawns were served with honey sauce which ¬†added an unique flavour to the platter. For the main course we had ordered, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Lamb Lasagna, Factory Mixed Grill and Chicken Neopolitan and I am glad to inform that we were extremely happy with the food.¬†
Chicken Cordon Bleu: Served with vegetables and Swiss cheese it is more or less filling.
Factory Mixed Grill: ¬†Grilled chicken and Roast Lamb served with mushroom,capsicum, onions ¬†and sauteed vegetables, it is no doubt a Steak Factory Special.
Chicken Neopolitan: ¬†Although we are at first apprehensive of this dish first, it turned out to be good.
Lamb Lasagna: Best of the lot, cooked perfectly like the authentic lasagna preparations and it will surely ¬†pamper your taste buds and keep you yearning for more.
This can be a nice hangout place ¬†with an average pocket pinch.

We ordered Golden fried babycorn- not chilly sauce tossed..only fried and crispy.
Also ordered chicken sizzler Mixed sea food sizzler and chicken steak. Chicken sizzler is a must try and so also the steaks. Sizzler preparation is very tasty.
D steaks are well spiced and adequate for a major meal. This ended wid brownie wid hot chocolate sauce..what say..yummy..

A portion of pork ribs was slightly undercooked but the rest was excellent and the mixed sausages were awesome.

My rating might come as a shock to many as this is a 4 starred place. But I might be addressing the issues faced by the few, the ones who are not shocked.

Me and my friends went to Steak factory after hearing huge promises of good food. The rating in Zomato was luring too. We ordered Chicken Stroganoff, Smoked Chicken & Mushroom Risotto and Tenderloin Steak; 2 Blue Lagoons and a glass of Virgin Mojito. The mocktails were very average, nowhere near what anyone would expect from a 4 starred famous place. The pasta in Chicken Stroganoff was not well cooked and when we called a waiter and asked him to do something about it, to take it to the cook and try to manage the food somehow, he said that there was nothing he could do. The Risotto felt like vegetable and rice. We searched hard to find countable pieces of chicken and mushroom. The Steak would not be cut even by the knife. After a lot of effort I managed to cut out a large chunk and thinking that my teeth would do the rest I put it in my mouth. I had clearly underestimated it. Soon I was choking on the piece and had to swallow it somehow. As if bad food wasn't enough. The washroom had a flush that would not work and there was no water in the taps. We could not have had a worse experience in a 4 starred famous place like Steak factory. Never going back to the place again. Deeply disappointed. Zomato should add an option for zero star, just so people can rate places like this.

I have visited this place twice and the place has a pretty decent ambience,few of the staff are courteous and cooperative,with recent changes in the menu it seems to have become a little too overpriced, nevertheless the food is nice..but quantity is not that great, however I visited this place with a friend and ordered for salads, steaks both fish and chicken,the bacon wrapped prawns which is an iconic item on the menu,also the mocktails and desserts are overpriced and quantity is very less,the A.C was not functioning properly,making the place sultry and suffocating, also many items were unavailable for unknown reasons on the menu,and the newly prepared menu's arrangement is simply pathetic.The first visit to this@ place was nice,but the second visit wasn't a really memorable experience though.With wide popularity this place also needs to live upto it's expectations and standards..

One of the most over hyped places I have ever visited. We ordered pork sizzler and tenderloin steak. Both the items taeted equally horrible. The pork was so overcooked that it was difficult to chew. Felt like I was eating rubber. The tenderloin was devoid of any flavour. Had no salt and seasoning. It was raw at parts. The mashed potato had no butter. Only good things were the vegetables and mushroom gravy served with the tenderloin. Meat quality is of very low grade. Place is shabby and very hot. It was a total wastage of money.Aniket Mallick

Located in one of quieter streets of Southern Avenue is this small but not-so-small cafe with great food to offer. It is difficult to locate otherwise, but like it was for me, GoogleMaps may come to your rescue. It seems like a place which still hasn't attracted significant crowd as I found it almost vacant at a peak dinner hour on a weekend. The place plays soft instrumental music in the background which may be preferred by people looking for a quieter evening.

The food here doesn't disappoint at all. We ordered "Chicken finger mozzarella sticks" for appetizers, and "Chicken Cordon Bleu" and "Factory Special Cheese Steak" for main course. Though, the appetizer was okayish, but the main course compensated for the same. 

Chicken Cordon Bleu is suggested for people who love cheese and mayo kinda stuff in their food. Nonetheless from a neutral point of view, it tastes great after all. However it is not recommended for people with a huge appetite (didn't look like enough for me, but was enough for my girlfriend who doesn't has a moderate appetite). On the other hand, the Factory Special Cheese Steak is great, both in taste as well as quantity. It includes poached eggs on the steak with veggies and fries on the side. It was perfectly cooked and presented well.

The service here is decent, though the staff didn't seem very well trained, but were humble. Will visit again.

This factory manufactures food, tasty food. Serves faster than many. Had a dish of pork only. Meat was juicy. Usage of lean pork is interesting. But lean pork lacs the flavour of pork as the fat holds it more. People are cordial and helpful. Interior is minimal but cozy. Big windows add a flavour of 18th century Europe. Over all good experience and will be back there soon to taste more dishes and definitely next review will be longer.

Coming to the food...Its a heaven for meat lovers.Come here for the meat cravings.
We ordered crispy chilly chicken which was very tasty and served in good quantity.
Cajun fish fry was a bit on the sweeter side but the fish just melts in the mouth.
We had chicken steak which was a treat to the taste buds.
Lastly for the desserts it was browny with vanilla ice cream... A pure ecstasy.
Would definitely visit again to try out the missed ones

The Steak Factory is a lovely cutesy diner that sells pretty decent continental fare without burning a hole in your pocket. The decor is kind of retro and minimalistic. The understated ambience and the dim lighting makes for a very comfortable dining experience.
I was there on Holi evening pretty late in the night and was glad to find a comfy place and no queue thankfully. We were two quite hungry guys and ordered for a plate of wings, a pork steak and a chicken cordon bleu. The wings are one of the best I have had in south Kolkata. The barbecue sauce was spot on and the wings were subtly spicy. However, the wings had less meat and more bones and that was a kind of spoiler. 
The steak was what my friend had. I tried bits and portions from the same and I must say it's the best pork steak I have had ever. The meat was tender to the point that it was falling off the bone. The fat was spot on and accompanying sauce delectable. 
Chicken Cordon Bleu was fabulous. Fried chunks of chicken stuffed with ham and blue cheese and served with a cheesy white gravy with a side of fries and veggies. The chicken was tender, the stuffing superbly tasty and I can go back again for the sauce. The price is decent, three items and we ended up paying a little over INR 1000. I will surely be going back soon.

Went for lunch on 19th. A pleasant dining experience. Had the Chef Salad for starters, followed by Ham Steak and Pork Grill Sizzler. Ambience is quite nice and though the place is small and cozy, not cramped for space. Restaurant staff very friendly and courteous. Prices well within budget. Overall, a place I would be visiting often.

Called them at 9:30 PM on a Saturday to ask if we would get seats there if go right now and they invited us gladly. They have converted a house into a restaurant and I must say that the arrangement is pretty great.

For Starters, we ordered,
1. Bacon Wrapped Prawn

To be honest, the bacon didn't really look like how I expected it to be, you can blame American movies and TV shows for that. ¬†It tasted pretty great although I felt the bacon was a little bit undercooked.

For the¬†main course, we ordered
1. Tenderloin Steak
2. ¬†Factory Mixed Grilled Sizzler
3. Chello Kabab

All the three dishes were pretty great and I have no complains on that. One negative thing I felt was that the seats were not very spacious for two people sitting side by side. My elbow was constantly touching the wall as there wasn't much space. Overall, a great place with tons of food to choose from.

Steak factory, Southern Avenue can be a bit difficult to locate, closer to Mudiali than Southern Avenue. We went there for a Sunday lunch and found not many people around. Staffs are courteous but they do take a lot of time to serve. We started off with bacon wrapped prawns, which was brilliant. Assorted meat platter is also good. We were absolutely disappointed with their chelo kebab ;disastrous to say the least. Overall a good experience and their decor deserves a special mention.
With a few competitors coming up in the nearby areas, steak factory needs to pull up their socks to maintain their foothold in days to come.

A Saturday night disappointment. This place is a complete waste of a huge potential. Placed in an old lake temple road house the interiors could have been brilliant. But it is a mere wall full of posters. Well food and service go hand by hand. We ordered meat balls stuffed with mozzarella! What can go wrong in this right? Well...A strong vinegar based gravy which was just a level up than stale and a stone inside a meat ball spoiled the meal.  Next came the factory mixed grill which has a mix of meat and prawns. I had tried this at the salt lake outlet and knew the mix. The dish obviously lacked more than one ingredient and the guy waiting at our table said they always had all ingredients in the sizzler version but not in the grill plate. Very strange! Desserts are supposed to complement your meal. Here it tasted as if from a mistir dokan in kolkata. Conclusion...Not up to the mark.

Left turn after Gallery Gold‚Ä¶you find Streak Factory, Friday evening at 8 pm we were the only customers, though I could see a steady stream of online orders coming in‚Ä¶ the framed menu is innovative but inconvenient, it takes up one/fourth of the small dining table, I had to be careful not to spill the water ‚Ä¶the menu is updated‚Ä¶unfortunately, the update is done only by striking out some of the dishes‚Ä¶signs of struggle?? We wanted grilled jumbo prawns ‚Ä¶not there, next time the menu will get updated again I guess‚Ä¶

We settled for the following dishes, played safe.. did not want to experiment on my first visit‚Ä¶

Cream of chicken soup: white silky broth with soft chicken juliennes ‚Äì good taste‚Ä¶. Served with a thin slice of toasted garlic bread

Cream of mushroom soup: It is the same concoction, but obviously with different flavor. Pieces of mushroom possibly marinated in lemon juice which provides a tangy taste..

Chicken a la kiev: Classic chicken a la kiev is famous for the flood of molten butter oozing out of the crumb fried pounded chicken. Steak factory have used herbed butter, but in miserly proportions.. I missed the flood of golden hot butter‚Ä¶. 

Lamb lasagna: Best of the lot, perfect seasoning, a wee bit spicy which actually is providing the zing, loads of cheese, the pasta is perfectly cooked and the minced lamb filling is soft, moist and juicy‚Ä¶however, Steak factory should have cleaned the margins of the plate before serving‚Ä¶reeks of carelessness

Californian fish fillet steak: The fillet of basa was supposed to be cooked in white wine as per the menu, but I received a crisp batter fried fillet topped with some kind of tangy tomato based sauce along with a bowl of rice and so called seasonal veggies‚Ä¶ when I enquired about the content, I was told that carrot and french beans along with baby corn. Why not broccoli? Well, they were generous enough to put a piece of broccoli on the plate‚Ä¶

Chicken parmigiana: Crumb fried chicken topped with possibly parmesan cheese, baked (which actually made the peripheries of the chicken steak a bit hard) and served with seasonal veggies (?), mashed potato and caramelized onion

Brownie with hot chocolate sauce and icecream: usual stuff‚Ä¶. Portions are small

Chocolate icecream ‚Ä¶okayish‚Ä¶

Verdict: Location is in a peaceful area, much to my liking ‚Ä¶, but there are signs of struggle in maintaining quality service‚Ä¶ however, the servings are value for money‚Ä¶everything is relative‚Ä¶.

A signboard inside the restaurant says "Eat Dessert First"....With which I agree because the brownie was the best part of the meal for me. Out of the dishes ordered the cream of mushroom soup did not impress me at all but the cream of chicken soup was really nice. The lamb lasagna was also really tasty. The chicken parmagian was a bit burnt at the edges but nevertheless tasted quite good.
All over the experience was satisfactory and I would not mind going there once more.

Firstly apologies for the late review. Had been there in December with a friend. I had basically become numb with cold. Was shivering like crazy. Saw this place and went in to explore. And my oh my!!!! Wasn't I surprised with pleasure written all over!!! It's a cozy little outlet in the heart of Southern Avenue. Ordered their Cream of Chicken soup which was the thing for me at that time. Also ordered a Chicken Steak which came out really impressive. Loved their washroom idea too :p.. Nice place for continental food

Heard a lot abt it so thot of visiting this place.Ofcourse it s a small place,a ground floor flat turned into a cafe... ambience s gud...ordered fr chicken steak ...taste n presentation ws gud...We also ordered fr Chefs salad which was an amalgamation of chicken ham n lamb wd vegetables...Of course asked them to omit the lamb...The only thing I disliked was dt d egg n ham or roasted chicken pieces were frozen...It needed to b defrosted a little more...Wen v told this to d waiter he agreed to help us bt was stopped by d owner saying very rudely "That's how it's meant to b".. Extremely sorry bt v hv hd salads frm elswhere whr d chicken is also not heated bt it's neither frozen like this...Jus a suggestion I wud suggest d person at d cashier to kindly adopt a more friendly approach...After all its all abt Customer Satisfaction...

Well, one of my Delhi friends came to Kolkata, she was anxious to try beef, so I took her to this American diner to primarily try ham steak.
The place was on my wishlist for a long time. Heard great reviews from friends who visited the place. BUT
on my first visit I found the place to be quite small, even they had one section closed. So we were left with one table option near the gate.
The light was quite dim,American music playing, the red colour walls giving a old look to the already old building that houses the restaurant on the ground floor. Nothing exceptionally wonderful about the decor.
Coming to the food , we ordered cream of chicken soup, served with a piece of garlic bread. The soup was awesome. Very nice to taste with a pleasant creamy texture to it. Next we ordered French onion soup, came with a piece of garlic bread. The soup was watery no depth in taste, total waste of money. Next for the main course we orders one plate chalo kabab, the mutton sheak kabab was dry but tasted good, the chicken kabab was quite blunt. The post pathetic part was the rice, it was overcooked,and was wet, the poached egg was fried completely burnt, it tasted bitter, on request however they changed the egg, but by them it spoiled our eating experience. We also orders ham steak, it was accompanied by boiled veggies and French fries. The best past of the dish was French fries. The stake was not smoking hot, the sauce was sour, the meat had a rubbery texture. Completely wasted our money. We also ordered their factory mixed grills, it was different meat in a sauce similar to the sauce they served with steak. The dish had chicken, beef, sausage, mushroom etc. It was quite mediocre to taste. We ordered one virgin mojito which was quite refreshing and nice
The bill was around Rs. 1500. For 3 person.
In all it was not what I expected from the place. My friend from for whom we went also didn't like the place. It took them quite a long time to serve the food.

If you are a steak lover then you definitely need to visit this place!!!Steak factory was on my bucket list since ages but never got a chance to visit this place.But with my bestie coming to town i made up my mind to visit this place.We arrived on a Saturday afternoon.Even being a weekend the restaurant was filled 1/4th.The first thing i noticed what was that it was an old house converted into an eatery.It is small yet not congested. We got a window seat luckily.I was impressed by the ambiance,decor and the red walls with yellow lamps hanging above the tables.I really liked their menu card which was framed.For starters we had bacon wrapped prawn and crispy fried calamari.The bacon wrapped prawn lived up to my expectations.Served with a sweet honey sauce it just melted in my mouth and had the right blend of spices and left my taste buds tingling for more.The crispy fried calamri was served with a mayonnaise sauce and was delicious.For main course we ordered ham steak,chicken steak and tenderloin steak in medium. The ham steak was the best of the lot.My friend who had it said it was juicy,soft and melted in the mouth.The chicken steak had correct blend of spices and served with an egg with sunny side up on the top of it.Both were served with mixed vegetables,onions and fries.Coming to the tenderloin steak it was soft and delicious and literally blew us away.Served with a mushroom sauce along with veggies and mashed potatoes it was mind blowing. For drinks we had Shirley temple which was good and cappuccino which i felt was more like chocolate ice cream.I am deducting 0.5 for their service which i felt was a little slow.Also there was unavailability of a mock-tail for which my friend had to order something else nearly when half of our meal was done since they had not informed us before.Nevertheless every foodie should visit this place.We did not have any place left in our stomachs for the dessert, so will be visiting this place again to try out their rest dishes and the desserts. But one thing is sure this visit satiated my craving for steaks.Will be dropping by soon again. :) :)

We went on a foodwalk and we found this.
Easy way to this place is by Metro near Rabindra Sarobar metro station.
The place is cozy yet it has an old english bistro look.
Now about the food we ordered
1. BACON WRAPPED PRAWN - the prawn was very fresh and the bacon was very juicy with the burnt flavor of the sauce. It was just yummy.
2. TENDERLOIN STEAK - The place is called The steak factory so we expected good steak. Well, it didn't stand upto our expectations. As we ordered for medium steak they gave us well done steak. Any ways the steak was tasty.
3. THE SEAFOOD SIZZLER - In seafood sizzler there were a squid and prawn dish with creamy gravy and risotto and veggies. Well the seafood was really good. The creamy gravy went perfectly well with the seafood. But the risotto was the worst thing we had. It was like normal butter and rice. The rice was mushy and we couldn't taste cream or cheese. The consistency was not like risotto. Otherwise the taste of the seafood was good.
4. CARAMEL CUSTARD - The custard was good.
The king of all the dishes was the seafood sizzler (without the risotto), and the steak (though it wasn't medium, the meat was tender)
The portion of all the dishes were quiet big and the service was quick.
Money wise its reasonable.
I will definitely go there again.

If you're a slave to steaks, trust The Steak Factory blindly. They'll serve you the best in town. Soft, succulent, juicy and sumptuous, they leave you craving for going back again. The red decor exhibits sophistry and vibes of you sitting in a European food joint! Easy to locate, off the buzzing streets of Southern Avenue, it offers you an exhaustive list of all kinds of meat delectables. The service is great and very prompt. Ordered the regular tenderloin and chicken steaks, mixed factory grill, stuffed mushroom caps and beverages, all at a judicious rate! Can't wait to visit again. Keep rocking!

I came here for delicious steak and was quite excited to find the wide range of steaks cuisine in Zomato. But when I reached there, I was disappointed to find out that menu published in Zomato are outdated and their options of steaks cuisine are very limited. I had to choose sirloin steak which was so so. My wife tried mixed sizzlers which she did not like much. So I guess tastes need to be improved. But talking about its ambient and interior, it is quite trendy and beautiful.

He had Chicken Steak. For starters, I would really recommend the Cajun Fish Fry. Oh and the last thing, this place is really reasonable. Very value for money!

If love at first sight exists, this gotta be it. The Steak Factory, tucked serenely off the bustling Southern Avenue, amidst the deafening silence of Lake Temple Road, is a misnomer of the word: awesome. The language does not provide me with much scope, but the fare is celestial. Ordered a chicken steak. And will forever be a slave to it. At the correct portions, the perfect taste and within the confines of Hollywoodish ambiance, only Michaelangelo could have bettered it. Or perhaps. 
Do give this place a shout if you are nearby. It deserves every bit of an applause.

It has a small seating area with good Deco and music  going really well with the theme of the restaurant!The ambience is indeed enjoyable !
We tried the following items-
‚ù§Chicken steak(4/5)- it was just amazing! Tender and juicy! Signature dish for sure... recommended!
‚ù§Factory mixed grill(3/5)- it had a lot of veggies and chunks of meat ! A healthy dish!üòõ
‚ù§Chocolate Brownie(5/5)-Out of the world! The brownie was served hot with dry fruits on top and molten chocolate inside! One of the best brownies that I have tried in my life!A MUST try!
Overall,I really liked this place! And I am definitely going to visit it again :)

Went for lunch ..I found this place as too much overrated. Each dish is sufficient for one serving only.
Ordered one starter named something kalimiri which is made of squid.Quantity was sufficient for two only .Not much exotic in taste.
Then ordered California fish fillet steak along with factiry mixed grill.fish was the only dish which I liked.factory mixed grill is too much salty and had a strange kind of sauce,not satisfying at all.
Lastly just to freshen up mouth ordered grilled chicken,which also failed to impress tastebud.
Anyway not a pleasant experience I can say !

Heard a great deal about this place so decided to visit it. But was very disappointed. The ham steak was nice but the tenderloin steak wasnt prepared "medium rare" like the way we asked it to be. It was very difficult to leave an impression of the knife in it. The chicken steak tasted very bland with no hint of taste whatsoever. And coming to the bill, we paid 1410 approach. For the 4 steaks that was priced 290 each before tax so getting 350Rs. Paid for a small steak wasnt what I was expecting. Quality and quantitywise, both were disappointing. There are much better steakhouses in Kolkata than the so called "Steak Factory"

The area is a bit difficult to locate. We ordered factory mixed grill and pork pulled burger. The staffs were not that well trained and updated about what is served within the main course. Factory mixed grill had grilled chicken roasted lamb and etc. I asked him to give these,he first said factory mixed grill did not contain grilled chicken but small pieces of chicken only and mutton served with capsicum onions and whatever else veggies were written there. But mutton was not written at all. I asked it's written grilled chicken and lamb. He then told me he was going to confirm with the chef and atlast said all those would be only included that was written. However,the food tasted delicious. Both the items. Although I feel the quantity could have been a little more. Overall view,there is no complaint regarding the taste of the food and quality,but the staffs need to be trained properly. Everywhere the tables are cleaned and then the bill is given,but they handed it just like that without even taking away the plates.

This restro is located in a lane by rabindra sarovar. It is located inside a house. The ambience is quite cozy. We ordered spaghetti with meat balls and factory mixed grill. The quantity was more than i expected. The spaghetti was good specially its base was really yummy. But some of the meat balls were a bit hard and chewy while some were soft. Next came factory mixed grill which had diced sausages, mutton kebab, grilled chicken pieces with lots of veggies and french fries. The quantity was good for a person. This tasted good too. But i personally liked the spaghetti more. Would like to go again to try the steaks :)

A cool hangout joint for friends and even family...the ambience is apt for their speciality though a little crammed.... its better to reserve if u r more than 4... coming down to food its simply appetizing and delectable. Portions may look small but are actually quite filling...bbq pork ribs are a must for all pork lovers...however the tenderloin steak was fibrous and chewy and was not at all up to my expectations....on the contrary the lamb lasagna was succulent with sumptuous amount of cheese on it...the chicken parmigiana was good too...however with a very limited choice for desserts they failed to give justice to the caramel custard as the caramel was clearly burnt and had an extremely strong flavour...though the brownie with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce made up for it... i would definitely recommend this place for all meat lovers out there.

The place is really small but comfortable. The lighting was a bit too dim but I didn't mind much. The staff were very professional and helpful. We had there Grilled Chicken and Chicken Parmigiana. Both of the dishes were well presented with ample sides consisting of mashed potatoes, french fries, saut√©ed onions and blanched vegetables. The most amazing factor was that the sides were well cooked too. We washed everything down with Blue Lagoon mocktail. The portions were good and ample for two.

Steaks are a treat to the taste buds for as long as one has known about it. So without further ado, my friend and I decided to hit this joint we found interesting
after an elaborate search.The Steak Factory was not quite the infrastructural gleam we had expected. It was more of a well groomed shack. We visited during the Puja season, so we thought it would be packed but surprisingly we had found our place in the small room. Although people who had come after us had to wait. So, Lucky us, I guess! The ambience was much to our liking with the lights and the frames with citations on the walls.

Much to our dismay, some of the dishes and desserts we had in mind to order were unavailable for the Puja duration, which was a total punch in the face. Eventually, we made up our mind to order the chilli pork for the start. It had the perfect proportion of spice and crunch. An overlook to things which were going wrong. For the main course we had ordered us the chicken steak along with the factory mixed grill.The chicken steak came with sauteed veggies, french fries and a sunny side up. It was delicate with the appropriate flavour and a prominent texture. The Factory grill was perfectly done with grilled chicken, roasted lamb garnished with chicken sauseges, sauteed vegetables and mushrooms. The grilled chicken and roasted lamb were all that we could savour. It didn't appeal much to the taste. The mushrooms and sausages did a tad bit damage to the dish.

Everything else aside, the food was mediocre, the hygenic factor did'nt hit the mark either on account of its washroom and the managerial skills were poor as someone who had done a telephonic reservation was made to wait out. Owing to the small spacing, not much of a satisfying experience.

The place was so in my wishlist since long.As I live in the northern side of Kolkata it couldn't happen until one evening I became determined.
The place is small and cozy.
It is very nicely decorated with different kind of posters and the music was great.
We had ham steak and it was awesome.
A must visit for foodies out there.

I ordered a Tenderloin Steak cooked medium rare and a pulled pork burger, Kolkata surprises me with the number of good burger joints it has. All of them are near perfection. The steak was cooked just as much as I wanted and the sauce was amazing, the burger was extremely satisfying. Will definitely visit this place again!

Location: walk into the lane that comes after Sarovar metro gate no 1, a few steps and then take the first left. There you have it on your left, "The Steak Factory".

Ambiance: we went there for lunch and we're the only diners then. The outside bears a beautifully crafted wooden title tag bearer. It is the ground floor of a house converted into the eatery. Two of the rooms are allowed for seating. On the inside, it's a quaint place with a decent seating capacity.

Staff: very courteous, well behaved and professional.

Food: Oh boy! They definitely make the best steaks in town.

STARTERS:
‚Ä¢ Bacon wrapped prawn : soft marinated prawns wrapped in crisp fried bacon. Delicious.
‚Ä¢ Chicken wings : honey glazed chicken wings. I have had a better version of this.
‚Ä¢ Prawn popcorn : the star out of the three. Must have.
MAIN COURSE:
‚Ä¢ Chicken Cheese Steak : A succulent portion of chicken coated with cheese and Cajun seasoning , grilled to perfection. Served along with boiled vegetables, fried onions and French fries.
‚Ä¢ Ham Steak : A decent sized, rightly cooked and spicy marinated ham Steak. One of the best in town.
Served along with boiled vegetables, fried onions and French fries.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Steak : This was a bit disappointing. The Mutton was undercooked and the taste was bland.
‚Ä¢ Mixed Grilled Sizzler : A beautiful concoction of prawn, sausage, ham, pork, chicken and mutton. Grilled to blanch out the perfect flavours. Served along with boiled vegetables, fried onions and French fries.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Stroganoff : Nothing extraordinary but not disappointing either. The general Stroganoff. A tasteful chicken gravy with herbed butter rice.
DESSERT:
‚Ä¢ Caramel Custard : Soft , creamy Custard with the right hint of Caramel and layered with syrup.
DRINKS:
‚Ä¢ Virgin Mojito : the favourite drink to end with. The mint and lemon made a perfect balance.

Would I go here again ? Definitely. Sometime real soon.

This place was in my wishlist from a very long time. Finally dropped in for a new year lunch here.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Ambiance was cool. Playing good music in low volume.
Staffs were really courteous and friendly. Service was not that slow for us but the other customer was complaining that they had to wait for 45 minutes for their dessert.

FOOD: Food was real real good.
We ordered one Jungle Juice and it was a green drink made from the mixture of apple, pineapple and mango juice. Loved it!
I loved my Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Risotto. It was served in a ring of the rice - half, tomato based and the other half, either parsley or cilantro based. It was just awesome!
The owner of the place had personally served the Tenderloin Steak that my friend had ordered and also provided him with the steak knife. He was really couteous.
I just had a small bite from it and it was really good.. tender beef and well marinated - full of flavours!
It was served with a sauce which, I suppose, was made with mushroom, tamarind juice, butter and garlic. It tasted very different!

Overall, I'm very happy with the experience. Kudos to the team! We're surely coming back again! :)

The menu is extensive and I liked too many items in it. I don't know if all are available always though. The usual steaks are rather usual. Nothing great. But better than ordinary. The service is good and so is the presentation of each dish. Go there if you want to try out a nice new place,but if you get an urge to have steaks, this is not from where you will come out happy. Of course you need to keep in mind that steaks are generally expensive, so when you pay less than 400 bucks, you don't get much.
I recommend:
#Factory Mixed Grill

The steak factory is a bit difficult to locate but if you follow the map it'll ease out. Now coming to the place, the ambience is amazing. They have seating arrangements for two people as well as for a big group. But on reaching there I found out that a number of items on the menu were not available that day. I wanted to have pork chops and pork ribs steak , but none of them were available. So we tried out chicken steak, lamb ragout, chicken wings and virgin mojito. The mojito was upto the mark and had the perfect freshness in it. The chicken wings were amazing and by far one of the best I've tried. They had a smoky taste which I loved. The chicken steak was moist too , considering the fact that a number of steakhouses fail to keep the chicken breast moist. The sunny side up egg helped to maintain the moistness. The lamb ragout was the dish of the day. The lamb was cooked to perfection and had the perfect amount of resistance in the meat. The gnocchi that was presented along with the ragout was not that good. Overall, the experience was amazing. They have friendly staff who are really cooperative. Would surely love to visit this place again. :)

This branch of The Steak Factory is situated near Menoka Cinema Hall. Me and my friends went their to have lunch on Christmas. The service was immensely slow.... Maybe because of the occasion. We were seated after a 15 minute waiting period. The decoration was quite good. Loved the string of fairy lights around the room with photographs of old Hollywood movies and Rock Artists clipped onto them. The food arrived after about 50 mins of waiting. But then again we brushed it off and just dug in quickly. We ordered Ham steak, Chicken steak, Factory Mixed Grill platter, Seafood Sizzler, Lamb lasagne and Fish Florentine. The Fish Florentine was amazing. Extremely soft fish coated with a creamy and cheesy sauce. Highly recommended!! The lasagne was another star dish. The portion served was quite large. The seafood sizzler was filled with prawns, calamari and topped with white sauce and served with rice and veggies. My friends loved it!The steaks were tasty too. I felt the factory mixed grill platter fell a little short of my expectations. The meat could have had more flavour in it. The virgin mojito was decent. Thumbs up to this place üëçüëç

We ordered the barbeque pork ribs, the meat was just falling off the ribs, bacon wrapped prawn,which was the superstar, I loved the idea, spicy chilli pork, the gravy was just too tasty, factory mixed grill, this was ok ok. Virgin pinacolada and virgin mojito were good as well. Would love to visit again.

Visited this rather quaint place hidden in a lane on Southern Avenue and I am wondering why I did not visit earlier. Nice soothing ambiance with soft 90s rock playing in the background. The place is small but nice and cozy just as it should be. Coming to food, we ordered Spicy Chilli pork with garlic bread - perfectly crispy and the marination was just right. Perhaps one of the best Chilli pork I ever had! Then came the stuffed tandoori leg pieces served on a bed of sticky rice - generous portions of minced meat stuffed inside chicken legs and with the sticky rice it felt heavenly. Next up was the Pork Ribs - the BBQ sauce was liosmacking and the meat succulent enough though I would have preferred more leaner meat than fat. But the taste was superb to say the least. And finally had the Monte Carlo - sponge cake with generous amounts of chocolate sauce. Yummmy! Definitely recommended!

This was my second visit to this cozy yet charming place. So I thought it's time for a review. I would say that the quality has deteriorated a bit from what it previously upheld.

My favourite dish over here is Factory Mixed Grill (pic attached) which appeared to have lost its charm quite a bit. I had Spicy Chilli Pork which was satisfying, nothing exceptional. I had Cheese Meat Balls which were okayish, more fillers than meat itself. I had Brownie with hot chocolate sauce and Vanilla Ice-cream. The cream was delicious and thick (a nice sensation in your pallet). Nonetheless, the experience was good. For a budget dining, especially for meat lovers, I would definitely recommend this place.

On a rather random corner, it sits almost as if it wishes to hide itself! The d√©cor can still catch your eye in spite of its incredibly tiny size. 
The food is good if not delicious. It's neither expensive not inexpensive. But, I still feel the quality of the meat served in the steak preparations could get better.

Highly disappointed on my second visit to this place. The bacon was undercooked and the fish was of inferior quality as compared to the previous time. The staff service was pathetic. The food arrived almost 45 minutes after ordering and the staff are visibly undertrained. Had to ask for water and cutlery every time we needed them. Not the best idea for a festive meal. Try to avoid this place on festival days.

The place is cozy, has a personal feel to it and the service staff is friendly. However, I wasn't totally satisfied. I went with my family and ordered pork sizzler, lamb lasagne, smoked chicken and mushroom risotto and barbecued pork ribs. The sizzler was average but the lamb lasagne was very good. The barbecued pork ribs were so hard that they nearly broke the knife and would have been equally difficult if eaten with hands. The risotto tasted funny as it was made with gobindo bhog rice instead of arborio. As a result the risotto become watery and tasteless. We even ordered a mixed grill platter and it was bland. The caramel custard was decent. Given a choice I would opt for some other place in future...

Tucked away in a cosy avenue off the main street , Steak Factory lives up to its name of producing an assembly line of mouth watering steak preparations. For starters , we picked the unique Bacon-Wrapped Prawns which was surreal. We followed it up with Factory MIxed Grill and Chicken Steak. Both dishes ticked all the boxes and were sumptuous . I especially loved the way the meat was prepared - very succulent. Not too many seats - so try and make your way in early! Great place !

This is one food junction that's always on my priority list.  I am not much of a foodie so i never experiment much and always stick to basics...  Steak factory is one place that has always kept me hooked on n keeps me going back for my favorite platter of chicken steak with mashed potatoes.. It's surely one the best steaks that i have tasted around the city.  Another one on the top of my charts would be fish and chips.  The platter looks picture perfect and its served exactly the way its ought to be..  The ambience and the service are top notch and customer priority is always given utmost by every staff member making your meal even more pleasant and comforting. All in all it's one place which i would confidently recommend for a Sumptuous satisfying meal.

Located in the heart of Southern Avenue, this restaurant will satisfy all your meat cravings. The first thing you will notice once you enter this joint, is the chic decor. Wooden tables, huge windows and Polaroid sized movie and band posters add to the modish ambiance. The staff is friendly and know what they are serving (which is a rarity) so don't hesitate to take suggestions from them while you order.¬†
Anything you pick from the menu will surprise you for the better. The Chelo Kebabs are a treat, if you are a little apprehensive about trying the Chelo Kebabs outside Peter Cat, this place will not disappoint you. Other things that one must try are the Spaghetti with Meat Balls, Pork Steak, Fish Florentine (my absolute favorite), Chicken Sizzler and the Crispy Fried Calamari. From the dessert section, the caramel custards are to die for and melts in your mouth which will in turn make your heart melt (that's exactly what desserts should do in the first place). All in all, a great place to binge on if you are craving the European cuisine and steaks. Coming to the pocket pinch, the place is very economical considering the food that they are serving and is definitely worth its price. The ambiance, the food, the staff and the money will not disappoint you. Its been a while since I have been there myself, writing this review makes me hungry and is acting as reminder that I must visit this place soon!

Coming to the food, we ordered the crispy fried calamari for starters and then spaghetti carbonara, baked chicken ala Neapolitan and a tenderloin steak for the mains. The calamari was really good. Chicken Neapolitan was also well prepared. The steak could have been better. Overall, we were quite impressed with the food and their service. I will highly recommend this place to our friends.

They have two outlets one in Southern Avenue and another in New Alipore.Visited this place in Southern Avenue.It is very nicely decorated as well as interiors have been done up well.

Me and My frnd visited there.We both ordered for a Chicken Cheese Steak and Blue Lagoon.when they served the dish on the table it's looked damn tempting and the taste were just superb.

The staff is very friendly and the service were very good.This place is a must visit for anyone who enjoys food.

Great food!!! Loved the steak!! Their bacon wrapped prawns are to die for. Even the staff was very hospitable!! Most restaurants have a tendency to decrease in terms of quality over time. The last time i was here was last year and the food was perfect even then. A 3.9 rating on zomato really surprised me. Was little skeptical taking my friend there, but steak factory did not disappoint!

Coming to food we ordered chicken steak, garlic bread and golden mozito. The steak seemed a little salty to me where the other two was perfect. Would love to go there again to try some new continental dishes.

Steak factory serves arguably the best steaks in the whole of Eastern India. First it was New Alipore, then Southern Avenue and now soon to be at Salt Lake. Their staffs are really courteous and well behaved. The bacon wrapped prawn is to die for. They are definitely way above their competition. Highly recommended.

The decor and setup is equally comforting. For people like me who are porkoholics Steak Factory is the diner for you.

THE STICK FACTORY!

This food factory has some serious manufacturing defects. Contrary to an image of opulence and abundance that any 'Factory' outlet promises, this place is small, shabby, pseudo-intellectual, forlorn and unprofessional. Right from taking orders for consignment to delivery of products, they lack commitment, quality and finesse. In simple words, the order placed was erroneously taken which is why Chicken Tetrazinni was served in place of Chicken Stroganoff and to our utter surprise, when the fault was detected, they tried to poorly cover it up by insisting that Tetrazzini is in fact Stroganoff. After blatant refusal to accept the dish, they quickly served a clumsy platter naming it as 'their' recipe of Stroganoff that lacked cheese, white/red sauce or extra dose of olive oil. The table had no accompaniments like oregano, herbs, sauces, or even the basic salt and pepper. Chicken Parmigiana was dry, horribly dry and so was Chellow Kabab. The food was cold or perhaps stale. The service was inattentive and odd or perhaps bad.The plating seemed hurriedly executed with the elements running around on the dish, without any binding of sauce or cheese. The place suffers from taking their customers for granted. They are unprepared and hence the experience was unorganised, disappointing and hence I doubt the place lacks consistency.

I have been to this place in several occasions and this review has been pending for long. Firstly the ambiance needs a mention since it is very cozy and well lit. There is a small room that can be taken up in case there is is group booking of 15 to 18 people. Coming to the food... the quality of the food served here has remained unchanged. I have tried all their steaks but would personally recommend the ham steak, tenderloin Steak and chicken steak with their mushroom sauce. The onion rings, Cajun spiced fish, chilli pork and spicy chilli chicken are my favourite starters. I have had their smoked chicken risotto as well which was made perfectly. Looking forward to many more visits.

Yesterday I visited this place for the first time. Its a small place, decent ambience and nice decor. Coming to the food, we ordered bacon wrapped prawns for starters which was absolutely brilliant. You won't get these at most restaurants so I would recommend everyone to try this dish once. In the main course we had Factory Mixed Grilled and Pork Chops. Both, the quality and quantity of the food , were amazing. Service was satisfactory . Will surely¬† visit this place again.

The Steak Factory, the name of it signifies that it specialises in steaks and chops. Though, the place in Southern Avenue where it is located is in a little offbeat area, it is not nearby any main roads where transportation is available. You need to walk anywhere you get down, as it is in middle of Kalighat and Rabindra Sarovar metro. 
Now, about the food 
In one word, It's delicious. We have ordered one Chicken Steak and one Chelo Kabab platter. Both of them were very delicious. We actually gained more appetite when the food arrived at our table :P the d√©cor of the food filled plate was quite nice. As we were more hungry, we ordered again for another platter of Chelo Kebab and then we fed our hungry stomach's to their fullest. 
But definitely I would recommend to add up a little more amount of food in the platters. So that people's appetite should get fulfilled by one platter only. 
But one should definitely try this cozy place once, n I m pretty sure that it will take you again to Steak Factory for their amazing tastes of their food.

good location, very good ambiance..¬†
it's the ground floor of an old building, they've decorated and furnished with modern look & feel..
and also utilized the space very well, with 3 different seating section..

foods are also good, a bit costly, but that's ¬†OK..¬†
as continental is one of my favorite cuisine, so I liked the foods, tastes are good.. nothing special..
the Brownie with Cream in the Desert was no up to the mark..

but what disappointed us was the Service..
the Staffs were less professionals, their behavior was good enough, but they were not able to handle pressure.. as we went during Puja, naturally crowd was more than normal days.. they forgot to serve Water at first, got after asking for 3 to 4 times, same with the tissue papers..

as a conclusion I can say.. you can give a visit in normal time.. it's a good place for hangout..

This place is located very near to the Menoka Cinema Hall. This place has been in my bucketlist for a very long time and I finally managed to visit this place with my friends. We went there on a Saturday afternoon. You would really be impressed with the interior and warm ambiance of this place and also their playlist. We thought of getting the Chicken Quesadilla but sadly it was not available on that day. So we had to settle for the Mutton Cheese Balls. Damn! The mutton cheese balls were so damn soft and juicy that we ordered another one. Next we ordered two Factory Mixed Grills, one Pot roasted mutton and one Chicken Tetrazzini. The factory mixed grill was simply the best dish of the day. It was full of grilled chicken,sausages and veggies. The chicken pieces were tender and juicy. The Chicken Tetrazzini was also good but I had better in my past experience. On the other hand Pot Roasted Mutton was a huge disappointment. The rice was under-cooked and the mutton was dry and unflavored. They seem to have a promising menu and you would thoroughly enjoy it. Also they need to buck up their service because service is a tad bit slow. Overall this place is a must-go for all the steak and meat lovers out there.

Little opinionated that I was about chelo kebabs outside peter cat, this place did wonders. Situated close to menoka cinema hall in southern avenue, this place has its own charm. Though not a very big place it is actually not that congested.

Now coming to food, all that we had ordered for were tasty. We had ordered for chelo kebabs, chicken parmesano, mixed factory grill and beef tenderloins. All these dishes were very tasty and filling. Worthy of the prices charged.
A small complaint. They are not quite compliant with the liquid preparations. The iced tea and mojito were bad.

Recommended for the main awesome food served( chuck the drink menuüòâ ) :)

Certainly not the best steak place. 
We went on a Saturday afternoon, and found is empty with staff being quite reluctant about taking order. The place is small and not having any impressive decor. 
About food, we had crispy baby corn, 
It's corn fritters with an aioli.
Aioli, was the only good thing In that dish. 
Had the chicken steak, it was a chicken breast, with a sunny side up, crunchy vegetables, French fries and caramelized onions. 
The quantity  of food is small. The vegetables were Good, but the fries didn't have any crunch to it. It was soggy. The steak on the other hand, was too flat. But the sauce was really good . Sweet and tangy. A sticky sauce you expect wjth a good a barbeque. 
Might come back for some thing else.

I know this place for a looong long time. While in school, before the exams, we used to huddle at those stairs for the last minute tips and tricks. I saw that place getting renovated, opening up of the restaurant, but never really felt like going there until recently.
But.
My visit to the steak factory was actually totally disappointing. We order a Tenderloin Steak and a Mixed Grill Platter, but both the dishes were really bland.
The Mixed Grill Platter is actually a colossal waste of 300INR. it's just pieces of chicken, lamb and sausages with grilled capsicum and onion tossed in some weird bland sauce with a side of veggies and French fries.
The Tenderloin Steak was better, but the mash was lumpy and again tasted totally bland. The steak came with another side of a sauce, but it was very acidic for our palate.

Didn't in my wildest imagination think that I'd be penning a review for this particular restaurant in spite of living close to it. The simple reason being that a vegetarian like me would definitely not go to a place that heroes steak( meat). But when some friends( who are definitely meat enthusiasts) planned to go there they pulled me along also. I went there wondering what I'd have there? But I was surprised that I could have a complete meal...starting with onion rings, grilled veg steak, nice coolers , Shirley Temple,a ginger based mocktail and Monte Carlo for dessert. Of course the veg steak was like a lollipop to appease a child....it was a veggie patty served with fries and sauteed veggies.( It wasn't too bad , Surprisingly) The mocktails were good and the desserts also good. My hard core meat loving friends ordered tenderloin steak and chicken steak and both commented that the taste was awesome.
The interiors are done up innovatively resembling an American diner. The service too was good. In fact in spite of being a vegetarian my food experience here was quite good.

Steak Factory as the name suggests,is probably the best place for carnivores and meat lovers,in Kolkata.
Located in proximity to the lake,this place is a little tough to locate for people who are not familiar with the lanes of the city.

But when it comes to the sitting arrangement,this place is really quite spacious.Being a first timer you will definitely get the look and feel of a place which resembles the houses of South Kolkata.
The interiors are really beautiful and eye catching.Posters,photographs,quotes and frames alight the interiors beautifully and that is an art which everyone appreciates.
Even the washroom is decorated with posters and wall hangings which add a comical sense to the beauty of this place.

Coming to food we settled for a ham,fish and chicken steak.One friend of ours had ordered for another chicken preparation.The steaks served in this place are juicy and tender and probably the best I've ever had in Kolkata.
Alongside this we had ordered for Chicken BBQ wings which tasted marvellous,some garlic bread,blue lagoon mocktail and some Coca Cola.
My prime intention was to try out the Tenderloin Steak and the Pork Ribs but as my tummy was full I had to keep it aside for next time.

The menu in this place is vast and superb.The food prices are very reasonable and the waiters are very friendly too.
The only problem we faced was a delay in service,which was slow compared to other days,because we had visited this place during the Durga Puja time.

What I see is this place is going to give a tough competition to other steak serving restaurants in the city.And on top of it this place may stand out to be really good because of its management and food.

Beef steak is all I have when i go there.... they do serve excellent ham steak too...but recently I had been there to find that the restaurant was open but once I entered I was told by the staff that they were on strike bcoz they were not paid their puja bonus. I had my foreign client with me. And this did not definitely put forward a good impression about business in India.... I would request the management to either keep the shop totally closed or run it properly in such situations. And about the staff ....only thing I can say is that the reputation of the restaurant is in ur hands ... if u ruin it once, customers won't come back.... n then.. forget about bonus probably the job will also not be secured.

A tiny place with awesome ambience and amazing food.

During this durga puja, me with my beau ended up here after a long day of pandal hopping. We weher asked to wait for 30 -40 minutes due to heavy rush. We waited as we had to try this place, given we both are steak lovers.

After our wait we were seated at a place for 2..the place is small n cramped but the food will not let you focus anywhere else. For starters we ordered bacon wrapped prawns and fish and chips to go along with a virgin mojito and blue lagoon.¬†

The bacon wrapped prawns are a must try.They were served with barbeque sauce....they were juice, crispy, crunchy and everything that could give your tastebuds a blast of flavours.
Score - 4.5/5

The fish and chips were good too...but after the former opener it went a lil low. The fish was soft and succulent.
Score - 3.5/5

For the main course I chose pork ribs were done nicely but to my disspointment the meat was lesser than the chunky belly fat.After a point I had to leave it as it made me too full too soon.
Score - 3/5

My beau chose a ham tenderloin which was amazing. It has a nice light texture with juicy bites.It wasnt as heavy as the beef steak yet had a light flavour of the same.
Score - 4/5

OVERALL RATING - 4/5

The only problem we faced was a delay in service,which was slow compared to other days,because we had visited this place during the Durga Puja time.

What I see is this place is going to give a tough competition to other steak serving restaurants in the city.And on top of it this place may stand out to be really good because of its management and food.

Beef steak is all I have when i go there.... they do serve excellent ham steak too...but recently I had been there to find that the restaurant was open but once I entered I was told by the staff that they were on strike bcoz they were not paid their puja bonus. I had my foreign client with me. And this did not definitely put forward a good impression about business in India.... I would request the management to either keep the shop totally closed or run it properly in such situations. And about the staff ....only thing I can say is that the reputation of the restaurant is in ur hands ... if u ruin it once, customers won't come back.... n then.. forget about bonus probably the job will also not be secured.

Well the ambience is not that good to be honest.
And the steak and kebab offered were of real low quality..
The hospitality was good though but the food quality was not satisfactory at all.
1.5 only for that average speed WiFi.

A tiny place with awesome ambience and amazing food.

During this durga puja, me with my beau ended up here after a long day of pandal hopping. We weher asked to wait for 30 -40 minutes due to heavy rush. We waited as we had to try this place, given we both are steak lovers.

After our wait we were seated at a place for 2..the place is small n cramped but the food will not let you focus anywhere else. For starters we ordered bacon wrapped prawns and fish and chips to go along with a virgin mojito and blue lagoon.¬†

The bacon wrapped prawns are a must try.They were served with barbeque sauce....they were juice, crispy, crunchy and everything that could give your tastebuds a blast of flavours.
Score - 4.5/5

The fish and chips were good too...but after the former opener it went a lil low. The fish was soft and succulent.
Score - 3.5/5

For the main course I chose pork ribs were done nicely but to my disspointment the meat was lesser than the chunky belly fat.After a point I had to leave it as it made me too full too soon.
Score - 3/5

My beau chose a ham tenderloin which was amazing. It has a nice light texture with juicy bites.It wasnt as heavy as the beef steak yet had a light flavour of the same.
Score - 4/5

OVERALL RATING - 4/5

If you are a meat lover then this place is for you. Located in Southern Avenue, Steak factory looks really different from outside as compared to a conventional eating joint. The ambiance inside is one of a kind. With posters of Elvis Presley and Inglourious Basterds, it brings in a different charm altogether. Coming to the food, beef steak and pork steak stand out in taste. Although the meat is not tender enough as you would expect it to be.

During Durga Puja on Astami, visited this place and ordered Smoked chicken and Mushroom Risotto and Chicken Steak for takeaway. Beforehand came to know that during Puja they will not be serving all the plates so couldn't order Fish Florentine. Also they said they will be using Basa fish instead of Bhetki so fish dish became a straight no.

Coming to the food, it did not live up to the expectation. Neither the Risotto nor the steak. A bill of 700 for two plates, and I was not even close to be satisfied. Did not find any chicken pieces in the Risotto. That's another mention. 

So to sum it up, not going back to the steak factory again.

We ordered chicken Steak and a mixed platter meat with two drinks.The service takes a bit tym though maybe dats because they have such good food üç≤ üòò
The ambience is good.It's an old house transformed into a restaurant,I like the way they present their menu and obviously the amazing pictures that they have on their walls.Minus points for the drinks we ordered that is a Virgin mojito and blue lagoon,they were sweet.Thumbs up for the amazing food üíó

As I am a lover if continental food , I think this place is perfect for me. The steaks are adorable , although the price is on the higher side but your taste buds and stomach will tell "please give the price"  , I tried pork steak which I find mouthwatering and a sausage and chicken salad called chef's salad made me awestruck .my friend ate a fish steak and gave a positive recommendation . In a nutshell I enjoyed the time

The only restaurant that saved us on a rainy Nabami night is this impressive place that serves up Steaks and other continental items. 
This is an absolute pleasure for the hidden meat-lover in you. The service too was friendly and the ambience is lovely.
We ordered -
Onion rings : Crunchy, light and simple batter fried Onions that are lovely as a snack.
Beef Steak : Hands down one of the softest beefs I've had. It's wonderful how easily you can cut the meat!
Cheese Chicken Steak : This was my dish! Well imagine juicy, supple Chicken breast moulded in cheese and with a mashed potatoes side - that's exactly what this was. Pure sin!
Chicken Steak : As good as it's beef brother, this is sinful as well!
Chelo Kabab : Thisis a simple version of the Chelo but with delicious kababs and wholesome quantity.
Stuffed Chicken Tandoori : By the time this dish came, I was too full due to previous gluttony but tried a bit- and it was gorgeous. 
By the time we ended our mass gluttony, we were too full to order dessert! 
Highly recommended if you want good meat at really reasonable prices. The added bonus is the retro decor and the feel good music that you can hear here!
P.s. Look around for vintage posters and photographs! 
Psst : There's one suave picture of Gregory Peck.

The perfect place for your neat cravings. I went there with a friend of mine on Dashami and the first thing that appealed to me was the music that was playing in the background that sort of sets the tone of the place... the ambience was warm and cozy....the owner was really friendly , greeted everyone and was extremely courteous. The staff was friendly too. We ordered bacon wrapped prawns, crispy fried calamari, fish and chips and pork chops... the starters were awesome and was comfort food at its best. The bacon wrapped prawns had a sort of smoky flavour that came from the tasty barbeque sauce and calamari was fried in a soft light batter to perfection. Fish was fresh and seasoned properly and the pork chop was juicy and the sauce was delicious. I loved the place and would return again with my friends for more happy memories.

Located at southern avenue very close to menoka cinema, this place is inspired from those American diners. Dimly lit a small place serving steaks. Sounds great right? So me and my friends visited it a few days back. The place could honestly be made a little bigger to accommodate a larger crowd.  The space between the tables is also a little too inadequate I feel. I mean I would not want to listen to other people's conversation. Really. üòõ
Coming to the food we had ordered pork ribs ( served with veggies and French fries), steak, chicken wings, brownie with vanilla ice cream. Food was good more or less. Quantity was fine to suffice one person. 
The attendants however need to up their game. They can't make guests wait for a tissue for 20 mins flat. 
Price wise I think it is quite reasonable.

The behaviour of the staff is excellent along with people associated with it.
To begin with Salad was excellent..Grilled Fish was good,Chicken Steak was excellent... Grilled Chicken was okay..but dish to watch out for is fish and chips it was just mind blowing. To end this lovely evening with caramel custard was nice.
I would recommend every meat lover to visit this place once.

For many days I was planning to have steak..which of course i have never tried...So as my sister and my best friend suggested I decided to go to this place along with them...

Location : Not very easy to locate...¬†

Decor : Nice.. Cafe type....

Food : We ordered Chicken Macaroni Salad, Mutton Steak , Ham Steak, ¬†Mac & Cheese, Bacon Wrapped Prawn and Grilled Chicken..¬†

Firstly the Bacon wrapped prawn tasted very poor.. i did not like it...¬†

Mac & Cheese and chicken Macaroni salad tasted good and may be was the only thing i liked among all...

Mutton Steak did not taste so well.. it was actually a lump of smashed mutton fried well...

Ham Steak it tasted better than mutton steak... still it failed to impress me...

Grilled chicken was grilled so hard that it was very very difficult to cut.. and in the inside it was flavourless and tasteless...

Lastly i would like to add... i am not criticising the food.. actually i had little or no idea about steak... so i cant judge if it was rightly cooked or not..it was my first experience... and i would like to say if steaks actually tastes like this.. this is first and final time am trying this....

Price : Not that cheap.. quite costly....it was a strong pinch on my pocket....

Service : Good... the staffs are well mannered....

Moreover disappointed. 
Visited this restaurant a few weeks back, for lunch. it was fairly empty. After walking in we saw a small room filled with chairs and table. Now we sat near the window and soon shifted cause we saw bees hovering around the table. We did tell them and they just shifted us to the next table. So not a good first impression.  Now the menu offered a variety of things . Its speciality are surely the steaks.  I would not recommend the fish and chips. Even though the dips were nice. Service was quite fast. Needs improvement and a better ambiance.  But thumbs up for the steak dishes.

Went there for lunch on saptami '16 for lunch with family. They dont have a big place, just two rooms with four and two seater tables. We were a family of 6 so they joined a two seater table along with a four seater. Food is exceptionally good to taste compared with the pricetag they have. I have attached the bill to give a clear view of that. Pork chops are horrible to taste with too much salt but pork ribs are marvellous. Bacon wrapped prawns are also good bit he bacon meeds to be well cooked. Fish and chips are not meant for vetki lovers. They offer basa fish instead of bekti. Chicken steak was excellent along with mixed grill. Nuggets were nothing extra ordinary but well fried. The moctails were soothing too. Overall a very nice place to visit for a continental meal. They did not serve all of their food in the menu because of the durga puja festival. What i didnt like is there loo which was untidy nd shabby. Another thing, since they have a small place to serve they should not allow other guests to enter inside unless table is empty. We our selves waited outside for a empty seat.The guests keep on coming and start waiting inside standing beside our table, as a matter of fact it was very awkward to have our food in front of them standing nd waiting for us to leave. This is y I gave them 4 otherwise they deserve 5 on 5. Better check it in the near future.

If you want to give a change to your taste buds(deviating from Chinese and tandoor) you can visit this joint located in southern avenue few steps away from Menoka cinema hall. Today being saptami of Durga puja I expected a long line but to my surprise we didn't have to wait at all . We tried their chelo kabab, grilled chicken, brownie and caramel custard. Chelo kabab was okay( the rice quantity was less), grilled chicken was awesome(specially because of the white gravy they poured over it), custard was not good enough as per the price, but the chocolate brownie was delicious. The Grilled chicken was served along with vegetables(only beans and carrots and one boiled cauliflower)& French fries. So I think they need to improve in few aspects. Could not try their steak. Hope to visit the new alipore outlet soon

Okay, this place is now officially the newest addition to my favorites list. A small and cozy food joint serving one of the best meat dishes in the city. Seating capacity is low and limited. I had to wait for about fifteen minutes just to get in but it was definitely worth it. Interior of the place is neat and impressive. Soft music which  was playing was surely a mood lifter. Now, coming to the food ~~~ I ordered a Tenderloin Steak and some french fries with some Virgin Mojito to wash it down. Food was prompt. On first look, I thought that the meat was not as thick as I know a tenderloin cut steak to be. But what the heck, it tasted AWESOME. Perfectly grilled with some herbs and spices, the meat was tender and tasty. The mushroom sauce that came alongside the dish was too good. Expected the grilled veggies, that accompanied the meat, to have a little spice, but it tasted flat. A little garnishing and some tabasco sauce cured it. Overall an excellent and wholesome dish. The Virgin Mojito was very refreshing and went well with the meat. The ingredients were proportionately mixed and the flavor came out nicely. Chilled and served, this drink surely receives a thumbs up from me. I ended up with some caramel custard from the dessert section. It was simply excellent.

Pocket pinch is affordable. I would've rated the place 5, but retain the 0.5 only for the low seating capacity.

This place is surely a must visit  for all meat lovers.

Can't hardly wait to walk in again...!! :-) :-)

It was just me and my partner and a nice Mahaloya evening. We just wanted some light dinner for ourselves. We ordered a couple of dishes..."Fish n chips" and a plain chicken steak. The fish served was basha amd tastes good. Personally i feel the outer coating was a bit too deep fried. As for the steak. The chicken was really tender. Felt extremely good in the mouth. The chicken slice could have been a bit more bigger though. The french fries were a bit cold(they came as a part of both the dishes). The ambience was pretty cosy with the perfect lighting...not too dim, not too bright. The waiters knew what was expected out of them. Would definitely visit again. Oh yes!!! as for the moolah, doesnt really pinch your pocket. Good going Team Steak Factory.

And I am surprised to be very honest. After Peter Cat, better Chello Kebab in my city definitely served by this joint. I tried their Mutton Steak also. Not out of the world, but good enough. A little bit sour.. Otherwise it is perfect. And definitely check out the washroom.. It is damn interesting.. :D

I have a generic statement to make. Take it with a pinch of salt.
"If you have ever loved the juicy bites of steak and if you have cherished the scrumptious nibbles of tender meat rolling inside your mouth, and if you have not visited this place, then I am compelled to say that your love for steak is unfounded and probably pretentious."
(Please do not get offended. It's just a rhetoric).

When I entered this famed steakhouse in Southern Avenue, I was instantly greeted by a wave of splendid music, amazing decorations, and a rather homely feel. The first impression was flawless. As for the food itself, I'd say that "delectable" and "pleasing to the palate" would just be an understatement.¬†

¬†I had ordered a Tenderloin steak with cheese (Medium prepared), a Garlic bread, and a Virgin Mojito. The steak was surprisingly soft and the meat was juicy and bursting with flavours. Loved every bite of it. A special mention to the pepper mushroom sauce they serve with it. Simply Mah-justic. I don't know why I ordered a Garlic bread but well, it was good, I guess. The Mojito was quite refreshing, but not something that you wouldn't find in other places.¬†

The service was great. Everyone was attentive and ready to help. For a steakhouse of this quality, I think the pricing is justified. Recommended to every steak lover out there. In fact, take a double recommendation (if that is possible :p).

Wow!! Simply wow. It's definitely a paradise for steak lovers. We ordered chicken steak, chicken ala-kiev. Both were equally good. It is hard to sit on for a long time with the plate.  The moment it arrives you feel like gorging on it. We also ordered fried squids. That was a bit disappointing. Rest was good. At the end, the caramel custard was the cherry on top of a beautiful gastronomic evening. The place is small but the food will make you weak. Am going again very soon.

The Steak Factory is an oasis for those hungry couples who have the odd hobby of exploring new places around Ravindra Sarovar.
A friend of mine suggested me this place.Indeed it is a bit difficult to find out, but a decent place to crash in.The posters and decorations along with the background score, even the cutlery sets were perfect.
Food was decent and will definitely make you long for the next visit. We tried cocktail sausages for starter which was nothing but fried sausages with a Mayo dip. For main course we ordered Factory Mixed grill, Ham Steak and Pork sizzler.
Factory mixed grill was average in taste.But both Ham Steak and Pork sizzler successfully tickled my taste buds. The Staff offered us a fourth main course, on the house, for which they suggested Chicken Parmigiana, a heavenly combination of mozzarella and Chicken.
In short, our visit was worth every penny, and I am looking forward to the next visit.
Must go for meat lovers.

Little bit difficult to locate if you're not familiar with the locality.  Ambience is nice. Was a little disappointed on my first visit because they said only chicken and steak available. Tenderloin - Sirloin nothing is available. I finally ordered for a chicken steak and ala kiev which pretty average nothing extra ordinary to mention. However, my experiences took a 180 degree turnaround 2nd visit onwards. Everything starting from Tenderloin-Sirloin-Pork to Chicken were available. I must say one of the best steak experience i have had in kolkata. My love grew more after i tasted the Monika Geller's favourite dish "Lamb Lasagna" and i must say it's just yummy and awesome. It's highly recommended when you visit here. Thereafter i visited several times and some of the few favourite dishes are Lasagna-All Meat Steak-Pork Steak-Chicken Ala Kiev etc. My only one suggestion would be please see if you can start serving Chicken Lasagna as it's hard to have red meat always.

Another must try is the cheesed stuffed tenderloin steak & Factory Grilled Steak

This restaurant is little bit tough to be found, if you are new to the place. Basically, the ground floor of a house has been transformed to continental restaurant with relevant interior and wall hanging. Food tastes decent but still there is room of betterment, I believe. Restro staffs are little bit sloppy, though courteous. Recommended for casual continental food craving.

A perfect little american style steak house located in the heart of Southern Avenue. Kolkata did not have a lot of restaurants specializing at steaks before the Steak Factory came to the rescue. And boy, am I glad.¬†

This particular outlet is better than its counterpart in New Alipur in terms of floor space , decor and obviously the location. It's subtly decorated with posters and photographs with warm lights illuminating the place.I visited it on a Saturday evening when there was almost no rush.¬†

I tried a couple of chicken steaks and the iced tea. The served steaks were softer than I expected and thus more enjoyable. The odour of the steaks will surely give you the feel of authenticity. The iced tea, however, was not at par with the steaks. It was kind of bland for my taste. The price of the food is reasonable to a little on the expensive side.¬†

I would recommend this place for it's one of a kind american diner feel, the steaks and the decor. Do try it if you happen to be strolling the lanes/ bylanes of southern avenue.

The food was excellent, so was the service. We ordered the tenderloin, ham steak, Factory mixed grill special, pork sizzler and I can vouch for each of these! The ham steak was the best though. It's a delight for true carnivorous foodie!

I must say that this a good place for meat lovers. We ordered bacon wrapped prawns, traditional factory cheese steak, fish and chips, lemon iced tea and virgin mojito. All the dishes were made beautifully and was very flavourful. The steak was well done though however I felt it little chewy than usual. Fish and chips had very thin batter, so it had very little oil on it. It was light and tasty. Overall, it's a good place to hangout and try various dishes for meat lovers.

It is difficult for me to rate this place easily. I have been to steak factory more than a couple if times. Every time i have tried new dishes, most of them have turned out to be lip smacking. However the thing which They falter is keeping the standards at par. I remember trying bacon wrapped prawn for the firdt time and was like "i am coming back for this again". But the next time was a dissapointment and even had to ask the staff to change the dish for an uncanny odour comjng out of it. Also the food served is not very hot and steamy which is a turn off. For tryouts, tetrazzini which is the white sauce pasta, chicken tandoori leg stuffed, chicken steak and hamburger steak are recommended.

A small cosy cove... that's what came to my mind on entering the place. Good, warm decor and nice collection of songs playing. Ordered the lamb lasagna and California Fish Fillet Steak. The lamb lasagna was real good with good amount of cheese and nice balance. The California Fish Fillet Steak was also appreciable. Overall a good experience and would love to visit again.

The Place has a Quiet Quaint look. Had a Veg Charcoal Steak. The Patty surprisingly was very supple with the Sauces well absorbed and at the same time not at all soggy. The sauce also was delicately flavored and accompanied by Boiled Vegetables French Fries and Caramalised Onions made a Great Dish, The Dessert was a Monte Carlo Again a Excellent Combination of a Cake with Whipped Cream Chocolate Sauce and Choco Chops. Would have liked a Little More Chocolate Sauce to make it more goey.

Must also have a special mention for Mr Sourav Hazra who did a great job by suggesting the dessert and his pleasant attitude made the lunch more pleasurable,.

Would surely visit again.

Good Luck

Steak factory gives u that American diner feel. Steaks are good and filling. But they do need to go easy on the salt. Being too liberal with the salt ruins most dishes. Mutton steak was not as I expected . But the Irish broth was yum. Chicken steak would have been phenomenal if a little less salted. Pi√±acolada was awesome. Service courteous and fast. All in all a nice experience.

Nice little joint. Not your usual restaurant but more like make shift eateries in flats type.

Service was decent. Ordered mutton and chicken steak which was quite filling and tasty.  But was disappointed with the starters which was spicy chilly pork, the pork didn't taste right and had to leave the dish incomplete. 

One more observation, we had ordered masala thumbs up , which was quite bad, it was clear they used an already used thumbs up as the fizz was missing and the drink was completely flat. Better to go to vivekanada park and try the beverages. All in all an OK experience.

After much hopping from one restaurant to another in Southern Avenue, we finally settled for steak factory. Friends had recommended it and after going thru the reviews, this place was on my "wish to go" list for long. 
It's a fairly small place to the extent of being cramped. With only 1 air conditioner working (which was also faulty), the feeling was quite suffocating. Certain items mentioned in the menu like pizza,quesadillas etc. are no longer available. So that did not leave much choice for us as we are vegetarians. This is all about the minuses for which I deducted 1 point.

Now coming to the plus, for which I am willing to ignore all minuses, is the food. We ordered minestrone soup, which tasted a li'l too sweet, but was yum. We ordered the only veg sizzler available, mixed sauce pasta, cheesy garlic bread, Indiano rice & risotto. Of these, sizzler and risotto were truly appealing to the palate and are a must try.

When asked for the bill, the real surprise came thereafter, as the management offered us 2 complimentary desserts for the glitches that happened. They were quite apologetic without even us complaining, which seemed a good hospitality. 

I would definitely want to visit the place again, & hopefully we wud receive our promised complimentary dessert one again.

I ordered from Swiggy. Tried the Factory Mixed Grilled (Kakori Kabab) and Spaghetti with meatballs. ¬†The spaghetti had a weird smell, dont know why so. The taste was too soury and tangy, not at all liked by me. ¬†It had meat balls kind of thing inside which were in plenty. The smell was disgusting, appeared to be a bit spoilt going by the smell, may be due to the presence of tangy flavors as well as cheese in the same dish. Totally a big thumbs down from me for this dish.

The factory mixed grilled was kind of boiled dish. Nothing has been mentioned in the menu about mushroom, however its present in the dish. Thankfully i was going to offer this to someone who is allergic to mushroom but since i tasted it first and spotted the mushrooms, i was quick enough to take it back to my side. Whats wrong with the restaurant, they should always mention if there are mushrooms and other allergic stuffs in the dishes. Anyways. But this was better than the spaghetti at least.

Along came french fries and sauteed veggies. Both were okay, but i got a peculiar smell after i had finished half, may be because of the packaging, it got some weird smell. Dont know.

Overall, experience was not good, may not try again

The food just doesn't live up to the hype this place portrays over the city and the social networks.

The pork chops is definitely the worst I have had in my life,the risotto has multiple flavous none of which taste good or mix into the recipe.

The drinks served were ok though. The place is small but they have done their best to renovate it.

But I would definitely prefer a Chilli's simply because of the better food quality despite the marginally higher prices.

Our stomachs were running empty at 4pm, with us standing near Southern Avenue. Most of the restaurants were closed then and waiting till 6pm for the reopening was impossible. So we decided to visit here, relying on the 4 out of 5 rating on Zomato. Oh what a nightmare! We ordered Grilled chicken steak, The Steak Factory special non-veg mixed sizzler and the Chicken Risotto. The chicken steak was dry and the skin was overcooked and still. The sizzler tasted average, mutton pieces tasted good but the chicken sausage pieces tasted old and of no taste at all. The risotto was below average with excessive sauce and the same tasteless sausage slices. We couldn't complete the food!

The music is pretty good and the food very healthy and tasty. The quantity is more than good, for the people who like eating to their hearts content will love it more and yes it is not one bit overrated .The price is very decnt just the service is a little slow but there is always room for improvement.

One of those places that gives you the option to gulp down some tasty dishes when you‚Äôre not in a mood to have Chinese or Mughlai. The ambience is very soothing with light music and dim lights.
Located in the Southern Avenue, near Gallery Gold. This was our second visit so we easily landed up there but had to wait for a while to get a table. Without wasting much time we placed the order. Spicy Chili Pork, Stuffed Tandoori Chicken Leg, Factory Grilled Fish and Chocolate Souffle was on our list. They served the Chili Pork first which was the show stealer among all. It was hot, spicy and full of flavors. The Stuffed Tandoori Chicken Leg had two chicken legs which was stuffed with minced chicken served with butter rice. The chicken legs had a tangy chili coating was cooked perfectly and the rice was lip smacking. The Grilled Fish served with some fries and veggies was a happy affair for my fish lover friend. After a nice meal, desert is must. The chocolate Souffle finally came and being a major chocolate lover I totally enjoyed  it. The chocolate cake in between the ice-cream with balanced sweetness quotient just won our heart. Service is good and the staff is always helpful. The bill amount was Rs.1100 for 2 


I just love this place!

Our weekends begin with a dine out and that too in a new eatery which is usually selected by my daughter every time.This time the choice got more limited as I said we must visit an eatery which accepts ABP Solitaire Card, so our unanimous choice was The Steak Factory-Southern Avenue.I had been to the Steak Factory of New Alipore, but here it was a different experience all together.

It is located at a remotest part of Lake Road but I called them beforehand, they were cordial and direction was perfectly given.At the groundflour of a house is the restaurant.It was raining outside and at the entrance sat a street dog who denied to move away, and we were told it sits there always and pose no harm.We kind of mananged and entered.Inside it was a warm delight, awesome music,nicely lit with an aroma of steaks with the perfect chill of the Airconditioner, our little displeasures at the entrance were forgotten.

The first thing that caught our attention was the Menucard, it reminded us of a typical Texas cowboy Menu Rack Card , which could very well hang from the wall.We were pleased with this.As it was late we went for our main courses avoiding starters.

I am a lover of Tenderloin and pork but due to medical restrictions now have to confine myself to Fish items.

Our Order:

1.GRILLED SEAFOOD SIZZLER-The quantity was good,it tasted good, went well with the portion of rissotto,but in seafood,I did not find any Bhekti,only a few Shrimps and loads of Calamari.Absence of Bhekti was a disgust.And in it I think Crab meat should be added as a part of sea food delicacy.I am not pleased with the item.

2.CHICKEN LASAGNA-It was good in quantity, but Lasagna has more cheese,this was dry.

3.MIXED GRILL SIZZLER-This was the item you can count on for.The sauce was brilliant, the sizzle was mouth smacking and the portioning was just perfect.

4. CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE-The imperfections of the Mains died down with the amazing desser-Chocolate Souffle.It was so tasty with chocolate chips and extra chocolate sauce poured over.

5.We quenched our thirst by Orange Flake Mocktail and Virgin Mohito which were really stress busters.

The ABP Solitaire Card fetched a 10% discount and the bill was Rs.1816/- which is a fancy amount without starters and alchohol for a casual dining outlet.I would suggest strictly to stick on steaks for this Eatery which is their expertise rather than venturing into other avenues of food.

Well this place is just serving one the finest steaks ever available in Kolkata. Had actually a lot of expectations and boy have they met all of them. To begin with if u visit this place and not have their factory special cheese steak, don't return. Next up among starters the chicken wings are dope. Virgin Mojito could have tasted better but that doesn't count as a negative. It could've just been better that's it. Finally the caramel custard shoots the moon. Ambience service etc blew my mind. The guy setting the playlist have some real hot Taste in music. You just get high delving into steaks with Poets of the Fall playing in the background without alcohol or weed, for that matter. Definitely worth a next visit. Peace.

A perfect place to hangout and have some steaks. The place it not so big, so you can feel uncomfortable if you go with a lot of your friends. The steaks are very tasty and nicely cooked. This same goes for the sizzlers also. Beside steaks and sizzlers I liked the 'fish n chips' dish also. Though I personally think this place is slightly overpriced judging by the ambience but I would still say this is the best place to have steak at this cost in Kolkata.

This was in my bucket list for quite sometime so I finally decided to pay a visit.The restaurant might not be easily located by some however thanks to google maps and knowing the area I found it easily.From the outside it looks quite small.The decor is refreshing and modern.However the tables were literally tiny.We sat on a table for two and there was hardly any space to keep glasses and the starter plates together.
Coming to the food we ordered chicken steak,factory mixed grill and chocolate monte carlo as dessert.
The steak was nice and soft and the portions were adequate.The base sauce was delicious.The factory mixed grill was good.However the lamb pieces were a little undercooked and hard.I personally did not like the plating of the dish.It was everything thrown together in a plate.Yet the chicken pieces were excellent and flavourful.The highlight was definitely the dessert.The monte carlo was served in a not so small glass and looked beautiful.It was not too sweet and the chocolate chip cookies provided a nice texture and finish to the dish.
The service was good and the waiters polite and courteous.The pocket pinch was a little high.
I would love to taste their other dishes someday!!!

If you want a Fine American Dinning experience this is the place. Easy to locate, just near Menoka Cinema. Ambience is a soothing one with dimly litted lamps that gives one just the right amount of comfort required for a fine dinning. Well, when it comes to service, it was quicker than any other restaurants that I've been in. Food was served hot and fresh and it was great! We ordered tenderloin steak and chicken cheese steak and two drinks called Jungle juice and Shirley temple. The dishes were awesome, tasted really good...they were healthy and wholesome too. Overall I would give a big Thumbs up to this Diner !!

It is a paradise for meat lovers. 
Ambiance is great with subtle music playing in the background. Perfect for lunch.

Coming to food, I must give them multiple thumbs up. We ordered

Cocktail Sausages- Well cooked and served with a buttery dip which is a great way to start any meal.
Fried Calamari- A bit chewy but totally excusable cause the batter and the dip make it so delicious
Mixed Grill- Actually quite bland without any sort of sauce. So much is happening on the plate that my taste buds got confused
Lamb Ragout- Gnocchi pillowy soft and perfect and delicious sauce, however lamb was chewy
Pork Chops- Extremely tender meat falling off the bone and cooked to perfection
Ham Steak- One of my favorites, cooked to perfection again, seriously these people know how to cook pork.
Tenderloin Steak- A little hard to eat. However the entire dish was extremely good especially with the mushroom sauce and the steak was soft and juicy once it reached your mouth
California Fish Fillet- Fish cooked to perfection. Sauce a bit tangier than I expected but definitely delicious
Chicken Cordon Bleu- My dish of the day. Cooked perfectly and the swiss cheese sauce was to die for.

No place left for desserts. 

A very satisfying experience. Will definitely visit again.

This place absolutely  justifies what it is known for..  a small cutely decorated place it was.. i and a friend of mine visited this branch of the steak factory today.. the place was empty when we went there... completely loved the interior and the soft english music was going pretty well with the environment... now, coming to food.. we first ordered the factory mixed grill.. then we went for the ham steak..  both the items were extremely filling... the mixed meat grill was pretty good.
 But the steak was better.. the perfectly cooked chunk of tender pork just won my heart.. the pork, the fries, the perfectly boiled veggies were amazing to the taste buds... so i would definitely recommend these two items.. and really looking forward to have the other items as well...

Being an ardent red meat lover we had heard about this place and it was on our bucket list for quite a few months.Finally ticked it off. We had ordered factory special cheese beef steak,pork chop and barbequed pork ribs. I had pork ribs for the first time and it was heavenly. The beef steak was also equally mouth watering and delicious. The pork chop was ok,didnt like it that much since it mostly consisted of fat more than meat. The lighting is quite soothing and has a vintage pub kind of feel with posters all around. The music is also good. Waiters were not too helpful as you would expect in other posh restaurants but the service was prompt. Overall I would give it a thumbs up and I would like to revisit this place again

Cozy n comfortable.... with that old world charm! Black n white photographs on the walls n a cowboy hat in the rack made it look really good!
Coming to the food.... it's wonderful.... well cooked n flavourful 
Chef salad, beef stake, n the chilli pork were just flawless... the pork sizzler was good but the mutton ragout was a bit too saucy...
Coming to the coolers... the Shirley temple was nice without being too fizzy.... but the jungle juice was really awesome....pretty to look at n just adequately sweet. However... the virgin mojito came in a rather short glass... I don't know why!
Decently priced! Quick service! Worth a couple of visits!!

This was a really long due and with all the exams and training, a perfect joint for relaxation. The place can be a bit tricky and will be best if you reach Menoka Cinema and then ask the residents there. We're kindly helped by the Swiggy guys.
The space is too small and kinda cramped with only a few small tables. Nonetheless, the ambience made up for it. The walls are adorned with legendary Hollywood movie posters and the benches add a cozy touch. Service was pretty prompt and the waiters had clear idea of what's being served.
We were a group of three and ordered 2 plates of cocktail sausages for starters which were delicious, especially the cheesy dip and I highly recommend it. For main course we ordered a Tenderloin Steak, a Factory Mixed Grill and a Chello-Kebab platter. The steak was a bit overcooked, even though it was ordered medium. But the sauce and the mashed potatoes more than made up for it. The Mixed Grill was okayish, nothing extraordinary but the Chellos were awesome. the Sheekh Kebab was succulent and the rice buttery enough. For desert we had a Chocolate Souffle, which just made our day better.
The total amounted to 1.6k which was reasonable given the quality of food. This is one joint you can't miss if you're a 'meat-a-holic' like me. 0.5 extra for the yummy sausages. Definitely going there again.

Been here quite a few times.  My favourite being the Chicken steak, which is a right mix of taste and quantity. Also special mention goes to the Chicken bbq wings, its tangy & sweet..lipsmacking The reddish brown hue makes it mouthwatering.  Some other favourites of mine are the Crisp french fries, Penne pasta in white sauce, the very refreshing Mojito , Grilled chicken. My friend was having the grilled fish and she just loved it. Said that it is one of the best she had..considering she stays in the US.  And what excited us the most was the Caramel custard. There are very few places in Kolkata which make such amazing Caramel custard. And Steak factory is one of them. The service is very good. The decor is different, youthful & cosy with good music playing in the background.

In a furthest corner beyond southern avenue this place barely seen if not searched thoroughly. Inner atmosphere is okayish. Though table arrangements and quality of them as a whole are bad, really bad. Coming to the food, we ordered shrimp cocktail and steak. Was good, not something to be remembered though.

The location is a bit difficult to find. I followed Google map and landed there. Ordered Factory Mixed Grill. It was quite good and the quantity was quite filling for one person. Ambience was good and service was courteous. Worth multiple visit.

New Alipore outlet is better , food quality not good enough rather degraded . Nice ambience though. Seems nothing apart from steaks are remarkable. May be for the below average quality you'll get an easy sit even weekend lunch/dinner.

Read about this place at Zomato....flights of high expectations had a rough landing..well the ambience is cool with dim lights...their unique menu card was good..
Sphagetti bolognese..well this dish initially impressed me but as i munched on..the extravagant tangy flavour spoiled the show..the meat was good indeed but nevertheless rock solid peppers did ruin the smootheness of the dish..
Lamb rangout..the meat was soft..well cooked..the gravy was balanced well with veggies and mushrooms..the mashed potatoes were a turn off for me..
Chocolate monte carlo was one dessert i would love to have again..the cherry topped whipped cream with chocochips and ice cream and bits of cakes in this triple decker dessert was impressive..not too sweet...thats the best part..
But if ur pocket frowns at u..it would be wise to visit this place later..

I have been here recently with my friends. Locating ¬†this destination is little tough for new-comers. Google map is a saviour or you can do it in the old way of asking people also. Food here is worth finding the destination.¬†

We ordered Chicken Steak, Factory Mixed Grill, Chicken Parmigiana, Chocolate Monte Carlo. ¬†The food tasted good. I particularly liked and hence will recommend Chicken Steak as main dish and Chocolate Monte Carlo as dessert. ¬†

Their ambience was nice and cozy. The decor was inviting. The staffs were cordial. The overall experience was great!

Well, the place is in the ground floor of a house . It's very beautifully decorated.
The bbq chicken wings were amazing.
Grilled chicken, the mixed grill included chicken , mutton, sausages in a creamy sauce.
Very tasty.
My friends like the tenderloin steak.
The pork chop was horrible. Chops are supposed to be small, they gave us a huge chunk of pork with a fat, which was not cooked properly.
They should include lamb steak into their menu.

Had gone here with my friends today for lunch. Loved the ambience, lighting and posters. Thus the European decoration was on point. The staff was well behaved. We ordered the tenderloin steak, the ham steak and the chicken steak too. We had to wait for our food for 20-25mins. Mine was the ham one. The meat was perfectly cooked. Juicy and tender, liked the French fries and pickled onions. The tenderloin steak was delicious too. However, for the chicken steak, we felt the meat wasn't properly cooked enough. We couldn't order more as we were already full.

Definitely worth the money. Definitely worth another visit. Here are a few pictures.

My first eatout at this restaurant was quite a pleasant one. The service was pretty quick and the people who waited on our table was really patient with our long list of orders and helped us out with the menu. We ordered the Irish broth, crispy calamari and cajun fish fry for the starters. They did not have the chicken quessidilla. The starters were all good, the calamari was delicious. For the mains, we ordered the lamb lasagna, lamb ragout, factory special cheese steak and the beef tenderloin. The lasagna was lip smackingly good. For dessert we ordered chocolate Monte Carlo. A perfect balance of hot and cold in the dessert. The cons of this place is its ambience and location. Placed in a remote corner and basically in a refurbished old building, it could do with a little more to up the ante. Also, the menu needs to be more elaborate on the steak portion, the New Alipore one seems to be better stocked. But overall a very satisfying experience..would love to visit again.

a tiny place near the menoka cinema hall...nice decor...neatly tucked away from all the hustle of the city crowds.  If you are looking for some quality italian or continental then this is the place to be.  we ordered mixed grill sizzler, spaghetti bolognese,  lamb lasagna and barbequed pork ribs all of which were nice and upto the mark.  although the pork ribs were a bit cold.  For desert a must try is the chocolate monte carlo...we also tried the brownies and custard.  a bit on the pricey edge but worth the money.

So after much reluctance I did visit this place once again. The experience was an improvement by leaps and bounds contrary to the last one. We tried:

1. Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin steak - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[I had a rare steak (the flabbergasted look of the waiter when I ordered a rare steak, was priceless) and one of my friends had the same but medium rare. The steaks were PERFECT. What didn't hit the mark, though, were the bacon wrapped around them, though a good portion, but a tad undercooked, and both the rare and medium rare steaks had similar undercooked bacons]

2. Surf n Turf Tenderloin steak - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[So it's a steak with shrimps, nothing could go wrong in that]

3. Bacon Wrapped Prawns - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Perfect. They'll melt in the mouth. Amazing job with these]

4. Factory Special Pizza - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[A little on the hotter side; will entice your taste buds quite well. The crust was pretty hard though]

A little more smiling team manning the place would make one feel nice; it would be more than just a "come-eat-leave" place, though, that's exactly one is supposed to do, but times have changed a bit in the hospitality sector, so yeah...

A good 4‚≠êÔ∏è for these guys. Happy to be able to change the previous rating. 
--------------------------------------------------
Nice cozy little joint, decent music with exact level of volume. Tried the tenderloin steak (rare to medium), chicken macaroni salad & virgin pinacolas... Would have been a definite 4‚≠ê as a rating for this place, if not for the following:

1. The menu on Zomato has ribeye steak listed while the real time menu doesn't. My primary motive of choosing this place because of a ribeye steak.

2. The servicing staff shouldn't, ideally, stare/talk about/whisper about visible tattoos & piercings of the guests, or at least make sure it's not audible/visible to the guests, even across the room. Also, it would be advisable for the servicing staff to check their facial expressions, smirks, etc. while they are taking orders; a genuine warm smile is welcome though.

Utterly disappointed.

One of the best meals I've had in a while. This cosy joint situated in a quaint by-lane serves the best steak, hands down! The ambience is so very English with soft music playing in the background and all the pretty wall hangings. Coming to the food, all of 'em were perfect taste-wise & the portion size will fill you up in no time. The only problem we faced was the suffocation due to improper ventilation and not-so-proper ACs. Still, the food makes up for every other thing! üòÅüíì

Had been planning to come to steak factory for long..however the dinning experience turned out to be disappointing. We ordered chicken steak and factory mixed grill. The former didn't tasted like steak, the chicken was not juicy or flavourful.. and the latter was bland to the extent that we had to add sauces to make it consumable. The quantity was not sufficient.. we didn't mind much...because we didn't wanted to have any more. Overall, a lot of scope of improvement in the quality (in terms of taste) of dishes served.

I recently went there for lunch with my sister. It's a little difficult to locate but totally worth it. The restaurant is dimly lit but the area around the tables are well lit. There's beautiful music playing and the staff is very helpful. We started with a mac-and-cheese. It could have done with a little more seasoning but it was delicious and creamy and we loved it. For main course we had ordered one pork chop steak and one prosciutto stuffed chicken in creamy mushroom sauce. Both the dishes come with a side of french fries (or mashed potato) and sauteed veges. The steak was an absolute delight. The thyme in the gravy was a little overpowering but the meat was well cooked and the generous portion of lard was to die for. The prosciutto stuffed chicken dish was a little misleading: there was spinach sandwiched between a slab of chicken and a thin strip of pork salami and the chicken was dry, chewy and tough. The mushroom sauce on the other hand was very flavorful and amazing, but in general I would not recommend this dish to anyone. We ended with a Chocolate Monte Carlo. We were full up to our brim but like any good dessert it went straight to the heart and not to the stomach. All-in-all this is a wonderful place to try out if you haven't yet. It's worth the money and will give you a food experience to cherish.

The perfect place to satisfy your meat cravings.
We ordered the 'Chicken Wrapped In Bacon' with a honey sauce, the Sirloin Steak, the Ham Steak, a Chicken Platter and a Veg Sizzler whose name I don't really remember. Everyone in my family enjoyed it and I had the Sirloin, and it is almost perfect. I asked for a medium, and got one. Great place.
One added benefit, you won't have to sit and endure Honey Singh numbers and clunky Bollywood music while eating, instead they play popular 60s-90s music, and it helps. :P

I went there with my kids... They loved the food over there... The restaurant is tucked in a lane and is a very small in the inside, however it seems the owners have an understanding of food and the way it needs to be presented on their menu!! A little surprise for me was when I wanted to order the Lamb steak I was told by the person that is will be minced meat made into a chop sorts... The very fact that he told me that before my order shows he knows what a steak means!! So I took to what the kids ordered...

This is an old house converted into an american style restaurant. The red walls and dim lights, give this place an awesome & perfect ambience for different groups, whether be it with friends, or on a romantic date. The staff here are very polite. They even help you out properly in selecting ur dishes, if u need their help. 
I finally had a chance to visit this place. And just by the first visit, I loved it. The speciality of this place : Steak , is like the best one I have ever had, combined with Cheese Garlic Bread, one will love it.
It is not even a difficult place to find, and the being a small place, the quality of food compensates to it.. The prices are also npt too high, it's pretty economical considering the quality of food you get there. 
I would recommend it as a must go once.

"Small Wonder" if I would define it in brief. A small and cozy restaurant located in the alleys of Southern Avenue. Had to use the google map to locate it accurately even though I know the alleys there pretty well. But once we were inside it was a a small yet comfortable ambiance, with my childhood favorites like Bon Jovi getting played in the background :)
Walls are decorated with classics from Marilyn Monroe to Woody Allen. Now enough of the description let's come to the food part! Had read quite a few reviews on Zomato hence the menu was already decided. Ordered Chicken Steak and Baked Chicken ala Neapolitan. Both were delicious and freshly prepared. Steak accompanying with French fries and fresh vegetables as always. The chicken portion was quite large I must say and enough filling for one person each. But the best was the Baked Chicken item! It was a wonder everyone must try! Large portion of chicken breast baked freshly in a white sauce kind of thing along with eggs. Juicy and succulent meat at its best! Surely worth visiting more than once! I deducted 0.5 point just because I found the chicken in the steak a bit tough and chewy. If it would have the softness of the Baked Chicken it would have been a 5/5 ! But still steaks are not kebabs so it is alright ;-) A must visit for every meat lover..

The decor is very quaint with posters of all my favourite movies adorning the walls. We ordered Crispy Calamari, chicken steak and chicken stroganoff. I loved the calamari with the sour cream. The steak was fine. I have had better chicken stroganoff. It tasted like a chinese chicken dish with rice. Its an overpriced place, I think judging by the quantity and quality of food. Its good enough to check out once though.

Located in the by lanes of Southern Avenue, Lakes. This small old house has been converted into a typical European style restaurant. The decor with photo frames adds to the perfection. Cosy little place with light music in the background. A good meal awaits.

The traditional Chicken Steak over here is perfectly balance to match the tastes of all kinds of people. Good enough quantity for a person.
Chicken Sizzler is another item which i often try at this place. Though i have had better, but there's something to the dish which makes me have it always.
Chicken Parmigiana is our normal fried crumb of chicken loaded with Mozzarella cheese. Personally i found it to be a little dry.
You could even try the Tetrazzini or Spaghetti and Meatball for accompaniments. 
No qualms regarding the service. Very polite and courteous.

The Chicken steak was ordinary one the Fish California was better but could have been much better if Kolkata Bhetki was used...The Cheese Garlic toasts were crisp and served hot just the way i like...The coolers were just the way they should be...
I know it's a bit funny but for me their Washroom was a hit...It's full with posters and cuttings and too very meaningful...Snap attached...

Ambience: The red walls and the frames give the European vibes to this place. The place is adequately lit; the place is small but not congested. The fairy lights and the photographs make the place perfect for a date or a quite dinner.

Service: The waiters are courteous and very prompt and they helped us choose our dishes too!

Food: Fish Steak, Lamb steak and Chicken steak.. They all taste delicious and they all do justice to the name of the place- Indeed it is a Factory of the best steaks in the city!!

The spaghetti with meat balls is a must try too!!

I have had the Chicken Parmigiana too.. Although I did not like it as much as the other dishes!!

Chocolate Monte Carlo is my favorite dessert from their menu.

We started our meal with the Chef Salad. Honestly, that was the best part of the meal. We ordered 3 main course dishes- Chicken Stroganoff, Factory mixed grill and a Chicken Parmigiana. The "brown sauce" used in the first too was not upto the mark, and the Parmigiana was not as cheesy as should have been. From the coolers section we had Blue Lagoon, Virgin Mohito and Orange Flake Mocktail, all of which were decent. The portions were good and we were too full to order any dessert.

Finally one more off the bucket list. Managed to reach this place using maps. Its a cozy little place which has been converted to this American style eatery with catchy red walls, movie posters and other decorations. Lets dive right into the food. Close your eyes and go for the baked chicken ala neapolitan sauce baked with egg. To cut the long story short it is simply heaven. Grilled chicken with mashed potatoes baked with veggies and eggs served in a bowl......I could go on and on about how delicious it was and even then it would fall short of praise. Along with that we also tried the chicken steak and spicy meatball. Meatballs topped with cheese looked appetizing but was too spicy for my palette. Steak was decent enough. I am sure they have much more up their sleeves and I cannot wait to try them all.

Ordered Mutton Steak and Factory Mixed Grilled. The mutton steak was simply awsome.
The grill consisted of veggies and different meat pieces. I love both veg and non veg foods equally, so the grill was delicious for me. It might not be the same case for meat lovers.

Undoubtedly this is the best place in Kolkata to find delectable steaks, while I have tried other steak houses too... This eatery is in the lane opposite the Rabindra Sarovar stadium gate. Its a not-extravagant, moderate sized place, with an old American classic look & feel.. The music added to such an ambience. 
Coming to the food, we tried the tenderloin steak, pot roasted mutton and chocolate monte carlo for dessert. The bill stood at just over 900. The preparations were mindblowing.. Although I wanted to help myself with another steak, and the mutton was very different and satisfying with round potatoes and corn rice, but I felt both the mutton and the beef could have been cooked longer. The steak was a tad bit fibrous. Monte carlo was out of the world... A mixture of hard chunks of dark chocolate, choco ice cream, vanilla and choco chips... Altogether created a mini heaven in my mouth.

One great place filled with an old world charm. No glamour and yet you get attracted to it like gravity. A little hard to reach given the alleys it's in. Nevertheless it is worth all the effort as the menu delights to the degree you expect it to. All the steaks are worth trying, Chicken being the one I liked. Desserts are a surprise awesome here. A little small in space but it treats your buds to perfection. Couldn't resist an extra steak even when me and my friend were full. A good place to hangout if you looking to spend a mid level purse.

After it being for a long time in my wishlist,thankx to a friend who decided to treat me here.
The location was a bit tricky,its located in a lane midway between Rabindra Sarobar and kalighat metro station.If u are coming from Golpark take the southern avenue and land upto Menoka cinema hall after which its just the next lane to the right, opposite the Marble Guest house.
From the outside it has minimal decor as its located in the ground floor of a home.Come inside and u will find brightly coloured walls adourned with movie posters (From Woody Allen to Marilyn Monroe to some of iconic movies)and the slow English songs added to the flavour.For a large group the space is quite cramped up though.
We ordered Ham steak,Chicken Steak,California Fish Fillet steak and as a complimentary got a dish free which we took the Chelow Kabab.
The Ham steak was just good,wouldnt say excellent as I felt the ham was a slight notch undercooked,however the sauce and the fries made up for it.
The chicken steak was just too good with delicious succulent pieces of meat tenderly cooked for the right time with an even better sauce.
But the main surprise was the Fish steak,it was the best fish steak I ever had. Just too perfect.
In the desserts we had monte carlo which was okyish with chocolate icecream on a brownie.
For mocktails we had Shirley temple which was good.
Overall an extremely pleasant gastrocnomic experience.
Hoping to visit soon again to try out the remaining dishes.

The American styled eateries are the new cool of the city. And this is certainly one of them. Located in lake road near Mudiali club might break some sweat to search for it for the first time. An old house painted and decorated to make it look like one good place to be. The interiors are simple and nice and they play some really cool music. Not a gigantic place but good enough for a lazy evening. 
To talk about the food we ordered fish and chips and tenderloin steak and twp coolers. Drinks were prepared well amd soothes you on these summer days. Fish and chips was good and I liked the steak as well cooked properly and came with some mashed potato and a gravy. 

Overall I would say a place worth visiting. They have some happy hours offer as well. :)

Had been at Southern Avenue branch and ordered for a tenderloin steak. The quality of the steak was very good. Juicy and tender. Was off course better than expected. Guys at the joint was courteous and well mannered. Would appreciate a piece of dinner roll with the serving, to mop up the delicious juices.

For so long this restaurant has been in my to-dine list and finally today I got that chance.
Location- its better to use Google maps.
Decorations- dimly lit place with posters of movies ranging from Elvis Presley to James dean; godfather to woody Allen. The most stark pic is that of woody Allen besides the poster of taxi driver.
Food- firstly, my earnest request to zomato team to modify menu card, currently none of the beef steak other than tenderloin and factory special cheese steak are available, so is pork ribs( deluxe cut)
Secondly, the food- quantity and quality:
We ordered tenderloin steak, lamb ragout, factory special cheese steak, pot roasted mutton along with a cheese garlic bread, French fries and virgin mojito and blue lagoon as coolers. Both the steaks were just awesomely yummy!!! Lamb was a bit on the hard side but the combination with red wine was never a let down and we loved it. And finally the pot roasted mutton was too good to say the least. Virgin mojito and blue lagoon were great complementary.
This place has free Wi-Fi and a very well mannered waiters just adds the final stroke of pleasance.

Nothing great about the place. And the most important aspect- the food is not at all great. Don't know about other dishes but their mixed grill platter is not at all good...no flavour no taste. Their spaghetti, i think we ordered for tetrazzini was equally bad. We also ordered a pork steak sizzler which was the only dish we found decent enough. Not sure if i will visit that place again given that we have other places for better steaks in the city now.

I heard about The Steak Factory from a friend of mine. Heard really good things. Had high expectations. 

So I searched for it on Zomato and on one fine day managed to locate the Southern Avenue branch (with the help of Google Maps of course)

The Restaurant is located near the Mudiali Club. The closest metro station would be Rabindra Sarobar. 
Located at a remote alley, right beneath a residential building.

The Place had two sections(or so it seemed) and the second section was closed when we went for some reason. The first room seemed really small with roughly 5 tables. 

The interior was cool with trending memes about Steak, some classic movie posters and assorted Bob Dylan, AC DC, Gun N Roses Playlist playing in the background. CAN NOT HATE THAT.


We ordered Golden Glazed Mushroom as a starter followed by a Ham Steak. Since this was my first visit here I was actually surprised by the quality of food. 

Prices are very affordable compared to the amount they provide. The Steak was succulent and had pineapple top and served with veggies and French Fries. I was expecting something spicier but I am at no position to judge the authenticity of a Steak. 

Do try the Glazed Mushroom , the Tangy Mustard complements it really well. One thing I didn't try but had been recommended was The Chello Kebab. Do try that If you wanna try Kebabs. 

All in all a decent hygienic steak place which needs branches in other parts of Kolkata.

The Steak factory.. An absolute delite for good food! Visited today after the last internals of final semester. The decor is really nice there, though it might look shady from outside,after u have entered the place evrything seems different; nice english track playing nd soothing dim lights. Coming to food, we have ordered factory mixed grill, chicken sizzler, chicken parmigiana nd tetrazzini. Mixed grill was nice with many pieces of chicken, mutton,mushroom etc cooked in nice sauces. Sizzler was served hot, amazing taste, one of the best sizzler i hve tasted till date. Chicken Parmigiana was my personal choice n it came out to be tasteful, stuffed with chicken breast inside n mozarella cheese outside(a nice alternative of chizza ;) . Tetrazzini contains many pieces of chicken n mushroom perfectly cheese baked , lacking flavour though, but if u add the provided oregano in it..it turns out to be awesome. Overall a nice place with good food . cheers steak factory :) ) !! P.S- u will get free Wi-Fi n there was a offer going on- 1 main course free with 3 main courses order. Love the place :)

Nice and cozy joint. I loved the decor. But the sitting arrangement could be better as I feel it's kinda cramped and suffocating. 
          I was pretty excited about the food but it wasn't as good as I had expected. I can't even remember what I ate. Lol. 
          Not a great place for large groups. I don't think I'll visit this place again.

Finally i managed to visit The Steak Factory. I have been planning to visit them since the time they were having only one outlet in Alipore but unfortunately something or the other always played a spoilsport to my plans. To start with, i must say the location is a bit tricky. The best would be to take the lane where the Southern Avenue swimming pool starts towards Rashbehari. It would fall on your right opposite the Marble Guest House. The interior is very impressive. Their setup is dominated by the Old School Chinese setup with dim lightings and long ceiling lamps for every table. The walls are full of posters giving that quirky feel. Service is a bit slow which should be immediately addressed.

Now coming to food, we decided for the Prawn popcorn as the appetizer with Virgin Mojito and Sherly Temple as the drinks. The drinks were average. Nothing bad about it but at the same time nothing extra ordinary worth praising. The Prawn popcorn was very crispy and even the size of the prawns was decent. But sadly few prawns were stinking and it seemed as if they were not fresh. very very disappointing to say the least.

For the main course, the order was a portion of Chicken Steak and Factory Mixed Grill. The Chicken Steak was absolutely brilliant. The brown sauce was cooked to perfection with the perfect pinch of pepper. The Chicken Breast piece was juicy and soft and blended perfectly with the sauce. The Mixed Grill was just okayish and could have been better.  Overall the experience was quite satisfying but honestly i was expecting a bit more.

Wow. This place held a lot of expectations from me and boy, did it rock it or what! The Southern Avenue restaurant had a real cosy feel to it. It was small but welcoming. The theme was a little like the wild west; red, yellow and all shades in between. The music was excellent; classis rock hits at a very subtle volume. Perfect for enjoying a relaxing conversation over some excellent food. I ordered the Tenderloin steak (beef steak) just over medium but below well-done. They did it,  perfect! It was juicy and all the flavours were very complentary. Only thing though, was that instead of mashed potatoes they served fries. They didn't ask about this when taking the order. The saut√©ed vegetables were, I have to say, a little less in portion. My friend had the Chicken Parmesan and that too was great. The sides of it felt a little burnt though. Among the beverages we ordered the blue heaven and they too were rather good. Really well made. This place most definitely is worth visiting if you're into steaks and a more continental style of cuisine. I am definitely looking towards visiting again.

The Steak Factory is known for its typical and tasty Italian Dishes... this outlet is situated at Lake place, Southern in the lane just opposite to Tollygunge Railway station... We have visited there for an Italian lunch... The place is small in size but greatly decorated with pictures, lanterns and other stuffs... The ambience gives an European feeling...
Coming to food, We ordered

Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Risotto
Factory Mix Grilled Sizzler
Chocolate Monte Carlo

Risotto was mainly two types of rice with chicken and mushroom fries...and it was very tasty and spicy...
Mix Sizzler had lots of vegetables and Chicken, Mutton, Ham, Lamb, Prawn pieces in it and was served smoky hot with a fried egg... all over it was luscious and enough for 2...
In dessert, Monte Carlo was lip smacking... It had Ice cream, cakes, Dark and liquid Chocolate in it...
Service was fast...
Overall the foods were tasty and healthy both... The price is little bit high... but if you want to taste real Italian then you should visit here once...
#A Must try for Italian dishes...

Absolutely abysmal service. It totally lets down an otherwise good food joint. Our appetiser (cheese garlic toast) came with the meal after 45 mins of waiting. The pork sizzler arrived with the starters totally cold with no sizzle at all. After waiting for one and a half hours and when all of our meals were done and finished my husband still hadnt received his main course. This is our second bad experience here. Never ever coming back. Invest in either a better chef and kitchen with the capacity to cater to your clientele or invest in smarter staff who know how to take an order.

Visited the outlet yesterday but my experience was not too good. For starters we ordered Prawn Popcorn and Cocktail Sausages. Items were tasty. For the main course we ordered factory mixed grill, special cheese steak and mutton boti kebab. The first 2 items were ok - I have tasted better at Chilli's. But the Mutton Boti kebab was not at all up to the mark - the mutton was very hard and pretty unchewable. For dessert we had Caramel Custard, Chocolate Souffle and Chocolate brownie with hot chocolate sauce and ice cream. The last item was delicious but again the souffle was not good - I have never tasted such hard souffle. Customer service was also not up to the mark - we had to wait about half an hour for the main course after the starters. Again there was a 20 minute gap between the desserts and main course, though we had given the order at the beginning only. When we pointed this out the guy who was serving us said that they had only one microwave which was available due to rush......... I did not get the point that how you are supposed to run a restaurant with one microwave oven. Overall not a very overwhelming experience....... the owners should focus on better customer service

Ambience and interior very nice including the music. Had order for the tenderlion steak , mixed grill and chilly pork.  Steak which had been looking forward for sometime was quite a disappointment , it was too soft to be a steak. Mixed Grill was good. Chilly Pork again was not upto the satisfaction level.

Truly they deserve 4.5
I have deducted .5 because of two issues.
1. I couldn't get my preferred seat as it was previously booked.
2. The cashier made a huge calculation mistake in the final bill.

We ordered for- Tenderloin steak and Factory Special Chicken Lasagne.
Tenderloin steak was too good served with a creamy mushroom soup, mashed potatoes, stir fried vegies and half caramalized onions. The portion was truly enough for two persons.
Chicken lasagne was not as great as the previous one. It looked like a piece of lasagne floating over cheese pond. Truly divine.¬†
Total bill was around 800 for two.

Food was great.
waiters were fine.
Served on time.
ambience was good.

*The debit card acceptor machine was not working.

Steak Factory is surely the one of the best I have come across while pleasing my taste buds. Starting with chicken salad, each and every item was really awesome. The ambience and music plays a great role. It portrays the 80's or 90's place with an authentic touch. Ordered Lamb Lasagne and Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken. Lasagne was minced lamb soaked in red wine baked with mozzarella cheese. The chicken was grilled breast portion stuffed with prosciutto and topped with creamy mushroom sauce. Both just awesome with its taste. In the desert section we ordered Chocolate Monte Carlo. A fine sheet of brownie served with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce topped with a cherry. The price may seem a bit on the higher side, but then tasty continental cuisine once in a while shouldn't pinch much! Try once!

The steak factory in Southern Avenue would be a little difficult to locate at the first instance. A small place, with minimal interiors, a lil cramped up... The service was decent. I called for a fish florentine which was just too good and a chicken stead which was yumm but a little hard. The stuffed mushroom was just edible. And the caramel custard smelled a lil egg-ish.

Directly comming to food.. they are tasty!! They are unique!! They are healthy and nutritious too!! Factory grilled fish.. basa fillet with white sauce... trust me iv never tasted such a tasty fish preparation before... chicken steak comes with black sauce...yummy!! Factory mixed grill.. which contains mushroom veggies chicken mutton sausages...is a classy item and filling too!
If u compare this place with petercat... the later might offer u better quantity but the former teases ur taste buds with its unique preparations...

3) Factory Mixed Grill
Pocket pinch: ‚Çπ1015 (including tax)
Starting with the Tenderloin Steak. The beef was nicely prepared. It was neither too soft nor too hard. Served with french fries, vegetables and fried onions. 
Chicken Parmigiana wasn't good. It didn't have any taste in particular but the mashed potato was well prepared. The side vegetables should be a bit more sauteed.
Factory Mixed Grill was the best part. It was very juicy and was served with french fries and vegetables.

A lovely place in a quiet but not-so-difficult-to-find corner of the road, the Steak Factory offers a pretty set up, good music and tasty food. Country rock sets the mood (though I know little about the genre to comment on that), and it has a vibe of American rusticity. I had my chicken soup served in about 10 min, which I enjoyed while waiting for the steaks to go. Nothing to complain about the steaks either. All in all a good experience at a fair price.

Food is delicious. The place could have been better and the Air Conditioners need to be functional. Anyway, the songs played were some of my favorites and from all the dishes I had, I liked the pork chops the most. I would recommend people to visit the New Alipore branch for more space and working air conditioners.

This place was on my wish list for a long long time. Finally we got the right moment to drop in on a birthday lunch date. A cosy dining outlet with the right kind of music and ambience.
We ordered Factory Mixed Grill and Smoky Chicken and Mushroom Risotto.
To say the least I was about to lick my plate after finishing the mixed grill platter. It was that Y U M ! The perfect kind of delicious cream sauce and succulent chicken cubes with a lot of exotic veggies. Completely droolworthy.
And as for the risotto we got a little misleaded because we did not expect the dish to be so tangy. But the risotto rice base was amazingly prepared. The ones who prefer that tang would definitely like the whole of it.
All in all our experience was really nice and just the way we expected. No grievances at all. Also the staffs are really helpful and amiable.
Definitely this place deserves more and more visits from all the food lovers out here.
Keep the good work up The Steak Factory Team.
And the ones who did not get a chance to visit this place still now, please doooooo it soon and expect to woo your palate most amazingly!

You would be needing the GPS to locate the eatery. The overall location of the eatery on a well paved street is good. The ambience of the place is calm. The patrons less talkative. The waiters well mannered.

Regarding the food...

Lamb ragout: it was served with an assortment of half boiled veggies, mashed potatoes and chunks of boneless lamb meat. The meat was tender and it tasted delicious. It was well cooked. I had to order garlic bread to eat the ragout with.

Garlic bread: four slices of garlic breads were given. They were crispy. Buttered. Fresh.

Tenderloin steak: I ordered a medium steak. It was served with half boiled veggies and mashed potatoes and a mushroom broth. The steak was tad sour in taste and fibery. It didn't taste so well as I had expected. The mushroom broth was delicious. 

I have one complain with them and that's the knives. They ain't sharp. And it was really tedious to have the steak with unsharpened knives.

The last dish I had at Bangalore, before leaving for Kolkata, was at a very famous and authentic steakhouse. Incidentally, the next dish I had on reaching Kolkata was at The Steak Factory.¬†

I would have given a 4.5, but honestly, everything apart from the steak was good. So doesn't justify the name.¬†Firstly, they don't have as much steaks as one would think and also they don't describe their steaks, which is very important for avoiding a bad steak day. A proper steakhouse also shouldn't have general names like Beef Steak, Pork Steak. They need some appeal in their steak menu. So, the 4.0 is only for the other delicacies they served and not for their steak.

First we ordered Tenderloin Steak or "Beef steak" because that's all that was there in their steak menu. And reiterating my observations above, that is DEFINITELY NOT how you prepare a "medium rare" steak. There was very little juiciness and redness to the steak and the sauce should be spread all over, not presented separately. Also, where was the tenderness of the meat?? It felt more close to "well done", the way it was grilled more than required. It seems they need to devote some time as to how to prepare the steaks in the 5 different ways and not just put it up on their wall.¬†

Now came the good dishes:

Lamb Ragout-Extremely good chunks of meat cooked with spices that hit you very nicely with that little tinge of red wine smell and pepper and the steaming hot condition they serve you in. The gnocchi could have been better. And the zucchini never existed. But the taste was good and the portion was really filling. Absolute value for money this dish was.¬†

Pot Roasted Mutton-Again, a piping hot dish that is pretty much enough for a perfect lunch, with the portions of meat and the rice they serve. Not so much of a roast, but it's more of "well cooked" meat, with a smell of herbs coming from the rice. The smell is a bit strong, but adds to the flavour so no bad blood there. Good ordering to my credit.

Now came the time where one could get back a part of his money, if his tummy is not overly full. They had a kind of Happy Hours, so if you order 3 dishes, you get the fourth one for free.¬†

And Lamb Lasagna it was. Must say, one of the best dishes of the day. Soaked and floating in a cheese sauce, this cheesy lasagna wrapped meat fantasy was hard to swallow for the two of us, after all the dishes we had. But slowly, we devoured the whole thing. The meat inside was minced and didn't feel much Italian but it tasted great. So all's well.

One last thing about the food-please boil your side of vegetables better and longer, if you want people to eat them, otherwise they are redundant in the meal, if you just leave them on the side, without even making them look good.

A wholesome and extremely filling and very reasonable lunch at this very small joint under a residential building. I would definitely go back for these dishes and some new ones and here's hoping they improve their steaks. No regrets about service or quality of meat, either.¬†

To a better tomorrow!!

The place epitomizes value for money meat dishes served with flair, in an atmosphere of an authentic diner, in an old traditional building done up funkily, with strains of old western pop and rock classics keeping the steakhouse experience nice and juicy.
The dishes we tried were the fish and chips, factory special cheese steak, chicken tetrazzini, factory mixed grill(least impressive but tasty enough) and last but the best of all, the pork chops with a side of French fries. The chocolate Monte Carlo wasn't too great. Coming here for the meat is advised, that really is the star of the show. A big nod to this joint!

Excellent decor, excellent service. We had Tenderloin Cheese Steak, BBQ Pork Ribs, Chicken Stroganoff and desert. Found the steak to be a bit tough, but the ribs were excellent. Pretty good experience

Visited this place on one fine afternoon. With my brother. We were hear for the STEAKS! As the name suggests. But were quite disappointed. The steaks are not at par with the prices and the quality you expect from a place which is named 'Steak Factory'. Did not have the 'ooh' factor in it. Was a regular steak. Highly disappointed!

Steak Factory, located near Menoka Cinema Hall is this pretty place at one corner decorated with rice bulbs outside. The interiors and decor of this place would really impress you and so would their playlist. Ranging from Bon Jovi to all the cool bands out there. They have their pictures hung on their wall along with some other pretty cool stuff.

Steak Factory, Southern Avenue is definitely very spacious than the New Alipore joint. This one has two halls and well furnished wooden benches. 

Now on to their food. I can definitely say that their food is far better thann the New Alipore Steak Factory. A definite no no while ordering would be their Mac n Cheese. It's bland and I never found cheese in that dish. Another dish you would like to avoid is their Spaghetti with Meatball. Really not worth the money. Or the space they eat up on their menu. Steak Factory Sizzlers are not that good either. Their Stuffed Tandoori Chicken Leg on the other hand, really took me by surprise. It tasted better than what I had in mind. Another dish that really caught my attention was their Smoked Baby Potato from their appetizer section. A must try if you go to Steak Factory. 

The place is dimly lit and has a warm ambience. Service is a tad bit slow. Points on cleanliness.

After having hell of a time trying to locate the place, we finally reached. Waiters are not too aware of the menu and its contents. Food was great. Pork wrapped prawns are to die for. Steak was not too impressive. Its not as gud as the new alipore outlet. Waiter was sweet enuf to get a complimentary mousse for my friends birthday.

This has been in my bookmark for a long time...finally got to try it with my near and dear buddies....this is in with quite a few of eateries which are trying to emulate the steakhouse cum diner experience in the city...contrast to the pricier options like Chilli's and TGIF...the steak factory dishes out its entr√©e at quite a reasonable pinches to the pocket of its target customers comprising of young taste-hunters....the decor is in going with the theme..the service nice....and the food tasty.... Well I would have liked for the ratio of meat to the sidings (steamed vegetables or mashed potato) to be higher...but that's jst me....the bigger sin about these steak houses in the city might be the fact that the sauces mainly comes in two basic forms...either mayonese or a darker BBQ base...and the accompanying choice of boiled vegetables are limited to beans, pea, baby corn and cauliflower (or brocolli) ... It's about time I would like to see some innovations here...all in all a fun non-alcoholic experience...

This joint is located on the left lane to Tandoor House and near Karma fitness center.

Seating arrangement were divided into two rooms where 1st room can have around 16-18 people. Hospitality and service were neither great nor bad. 

Ordered grilled chicken (Full) and after having some of it I felt guilty for coming here because those chicken pcs had lots of fibre and I found  like eating grasses like a cow ,no taste and neither salt also.. Very poor experience, my rating was only for that orange flake mocktail we had..

Cool Interiors = Check¬†
Nice Music = Check
Good Food= Double Check!

What we thought would be a small outlet near Southern Avenue, turns out to be a very nicely decorated with Cool stuffs. They have played with the lights very well and with the posters of movies like 'Gone with The winds' & 'Taxi Driver', they have managed to give it a chick look! I even liked their wash room,as the walls were filled with 'FRIENDS' posters!! <3¬†

So, Friday evening, 3 of us decided to give it a try. We were looking to have some good steaks and of course, we relayed on Zomato's feedback. We reached at around 8:00PM and were impressed by the place immediately. We ordered Chilli Roasted Pork for starters. It was really good. Pieces were big and the coat was a bit cheesy, something new. It was enough for 3 of us.

Main food:
1. Chicken Permigiana- Coated with cheese a portion of chicken, with smashed potato and veggies. It was good. Not that great and it was heavy. Quite tummy fiiling.

2. Chelow Kebab: Well, their chelow kebab was different than Peter Cat. The Mutton sikh-kebab was absolutely tender and juicy. Unlike Peter Cat, their rice portion was pretty good. Even the chicken kebab was also nicely marinated and rich with masala. A very nice preparation.

3. Factory Special Cheese Steak (Chicken): The 2nd Best dish we tasted. It was juicy, cheesy and it tasted heavenly. A+ on this dish.

4. Factory Special Mixed Grill: Sausages, Mushrooms, Roasted Chicken & Kakori Kebab, with French Fries & Veggies. - Tested good, the ¬†kakori Kebab specially tasted awesome. Soft and well cooked.

4. The Dessert- Hot Chocolate Brownie with Vanila Ice-Cream. The BEST So far. It was just OH-So-GOOD!! I actually had goosebumps on the 1st bite! A must have if you are visiting.

All an all a very good place to have a nice dinner if you like continental. Pocket Pinch is also not that much. It's worth the money.

This place had grabbed my eyes when it was first opened at New alipore. Didn't get a chance to go there but visited this branch of theirs. Known for their steaks, we did order things like that but turned out to be a disappointment. 
The place, ambiance and staff were up to the mark but the food wasn't. The steak was really dry and tough and was thus hard to cut through. The burger was well made but surely could've been better. Almost everyone I discussed about this place told me that the New Alipore one is better than this one in terms of food.
But do not take my review in a negative sense. I would give it an average rating.

Quaint decor with old Hollywood frames, bright table linen, and a well chosen background score are the first things that register. Next up is the simply awesome menu, quick service and genuine interest in helping guests choose their food. No hard sell, no covert add ons or 'value adds' as they are referred to. When the food arrives, it's actually a quiet moment of celebration. The presentation is perfect, the food tastes exactly as it should and the portion sizes are just great. Definitely a repeat visit outlet.

Its an old American style restaurant...the ambience was not bad nd it was not huge spaced inside..a little restaurant with hidden gem u can say...there were only pros i could find..
We started our meal with chilli pork..then moved on to grilled chicken steak and fish sizzler...the food tasted awsome...nd the quantity wasn't too bad either...the presentation was also nice as it was simple...the staff being very helpful, we found no trouble in selecting the dishes...
In overall, I can say the restaurant is a must visit for somebody loving steaks and sizzlers...the prices are also not too high...its affordable...
So guys give it a try
*P.S- Free wifi with good speed...üòú

This place is a must visit for steak and sizzler lovers. Set up in an american setup, and they have did it well!! You'll get that american vibe from the posters and the wooden floors... We luckily went there in happy hours, and got a dessert free. I guess the haapy hours is from mon-fri in between 12-3 or something close to that.. The sizzler was really nice and i'll surely visit again.

Have been to this eatery in Feb 2016. Have heard of it. So visited right on my marriage anniversary with my better half. Was too hungry at lunch time. The ambience was something that grabbed my attention. The interior walls are dotted with film music personalities and the music is top class from rock to pop. We ordered for mutton steak and factory mixed grill. And the moment I put a piece of steak into my mouth I knew I am in love with the food. The sauce is such lovely tossed sauce that you can simply enjoy it. We were hungry and just lobbed every bit of the food with pleasure and enthusiasm. Then we ordered a Chicken Tettrazzini. And I just loved its authenticity. I can say hands down that my very first visit to this place is one very good experience. Thank You The Steak Factory. I will visit again. And also suggest my foodie friends to go and have the best steak of the city.

I have been to this delightful restaurant quite a few times, and it has never disappointed me. They do not serve a few items like pork ribs anymore, but the plethora of dishes is still impressive.
The ambience is nice. Old English songs play in background just at the right volume,they do not disturb the conversation. The rooms are a bit small,but there are three of them,so space is not a concern.
The food is nice. I am not a steak specialist, so I will not get into the technicalities,but they sure satisfy me. The medium rare tenderloin is juicy and the ham steak comes with a generous amount of fat and is heavenly. The pork chop is so soft, that I used a spoon to eat it,no fork and knife needed. All the main course dishes are served with vegetables and mashed potato or french fries. The vegetables could be better and the only thing I think needs attention.
In the happy hours on weekdays they serve a free dessert with two main courses and a free main course with three main courses..that is definitely nice.
The service is courteous. I would not say it is prompt but it is definitely worth waiting for.
All in all, its a gem in southern avenue and is to be surely visited after a leisurely walk beside Ravindra Sarovar.

Though I am not too fond of having steaks. But after visiting this place I quite liked the food .and the most interesting thing that appealed me was the place and its decoration. How an old house has turned into an American styled restora...undoubtedly a great thought. While having our food the songs from Coldplay was actually creating a charm on its own. Tenderloin steak that was full cooked yet juicy..it came with mashed potatoes and vegetable salad.Lamb lasagne was creamy and cheesy though the condiments they used were not traditional strictly speaking and lastly was the chelo kebab that was volumptuos and really good to taste.The staff were quite helpful. I enjoyed a lot with my friends irrespective of communist thought üòÇ

Had Fish 'N' Chips.The fish was soft, juicy yet crispy. But what I loved more was those perfectly spiced chips that will have you wanting for more. And the best part? The dip! Its mayo with some certain spices and a lil bit of alcohol I guess that gives it its twisty flavour.
P.S- Service was realy nice.

The first thing one would notice upon entering this place is the posh decor with Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison posters making up your background. The ambience is quite good. The steaks didnt really blow my mind away. But then again they made up for that with their limited choice of deserts. The Brownie with ice cream and choc sauce is to die for. It is orgasmic. If you are a person who likes his/her steak done Medium Rare then this is the place.
P.s. These guys have good taste in music. Throughout the meal all i heard was Led Zep, Jim Morrison, The Eagles and Deep Purple.

I really didn't knew about this gem which is located near to my locality. Its a great place for trying out Continental dishes. The ambience is quite different but I really liked it, small but cozy and also has a speedy WiFi. Went here with five of my friends and we each ordered different starters and main course, service was quick despite the long list of orders. We ordered Fish and Chips, Spicy Mutton Meat Balls and Cajun Fish Fry for stater, out of all these Cajun Fish Fry was the best, the others were also good. For main course Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Risotto, Lamb Ragout, Stuffed Tandoori Chicken Leg and Factory Mixed Grill. Honestly speaking each and every dish and drink that we ordered looked spectacular and tasted awesome, there was nothing to complaint about. Pricing is reasonable and so is the quantity. We left the place with smiles in our face, completely full, satisfied and planing when we could come back next. Great place, highly recommended.

Had dinner at the Steak Factory on a recent visit to my hometown of Calcutta. Over the last few years, a large number of small but high quality restaurants have sprung up in our South Calcutta neighborhood and I jumped at the suggestion to visit one from my parents. Given the beef ban in Bombay, it has become almost a ritual for me to sample a steak whenever I travel to Bangalore or Calcutta nowadays. The restaurant is small, located on the ground floor of a typical South Calcutta house. Yes, the type of houses that are fast being replaced by identical apartment buildings, leading to the writer Amit Chaudhuri's conservation initiative. The decor is cozy and warm with red walls and the dim lighting, combined with New York memorabilia from film posters of Woody Allen and Marilyn Monroe, creating an unique impression. The seating area is small and a little cramped, but you quickly forget that as your eye wanders over the "Americana" diner signs and other artwork. I ordered the Tenderloin Steak (medium well), which was accompanied by vegetables, mashed potatoes and a mushroom sauce that complemented it well. The meat was juicy and of a good quality, so definitely enjoyed it. My parents ordered the Peter Cat classic, the Cello Kebab and a lamb ragout which were both also generously portioned and tasted great on a cold winter evening. For dessert, we went with the waiters suggestion of a Chocolate Monte Carlo - an ice cream dessert, interspersed with layers of chocolate and cake. This was a new dish we tasted and a perfect end to an indulgent meal. Overall, had a good meal at a cute neighborhood restaurant and I look forward to stopping by again.

Pros: good and authentic decor, nice service, good playlist, nice and juicy steaks pleasing every tastebuds, cosy warm and hearty place to have lunch or dinner.

Cons: a tad bit small, finding this place as it is located in a by-lane, for the price listed quantity should be more.

This place is located at the opposite lane of Karma. The place is very limited for dine in, though the ambience is quite good. Loved the food here, the steaks were very yummy. Will come back very soon.

Went there with a friend, her choice since I am a vegetarian.. Firstly, the location- a bit difficult to find. But once you know the place, it is easy to locate the second time. Food was good, even though choices for a vegetarian are very few (with name like streak factory, I didn't have high hopes either). But the decor is wonderful. Realised it receives good deal of patronage from nearby residents too. Overall a good experience. :)

Firstly a little hard to locate, this outlet has a western decor which suits the place and cuisine served. We ordered Tenderloin steak, cheese garlic bread and the regular blue lagoon. Steak was well cooked and was stomach filling. Garlic bread and blue lagoon were like regular joints. It is quite pocket friendly. Had a great time!

I used to love this place for their BBQ Pork Ribs which in my opinion was one of the best in the town. But, boy did the food quality of this place have deteriorated with time. Consistency is one of the hardest thing to maintain in a restaurant business. And with time, The Steak Factory's food quality has become so pathetic that's it's unbelievable that I once wrote a review for this place, praising their ribs.  My friend ordered Spaghetti Carbonara which was suppose to have Bacon in it and instead we got a bland pasta with chicken sausage in it. Upon showing them, they did took the food away & the redid that with Bacon, but my question is why? Why not get it right the first time only. Coming to my order, I ordered a Factory Grilled Fish, where the fish was over cooked to an extent where it almost made me feel like I was having baby food. And why not use a new bowl of butter when you are cooking? Why you gotta use the butter from yesterday when the chef himself knows the its gonna have a mild stale smell to it. And what I don't get is that, why do they have to cook everything which has an over explosion of lemon in it. I don't even wanna talk about the veggies that was served with the fish coz if you can't make the main dish properly, talking about how bad the sides sucked is pointless. Though, their virgin mojito was top notch. Credit where it's due. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they bring up their food standard.

Ordered my favorite Chicken Steak and Risotto along with German Potato Salad and what I wanted to say is just awesome. Really appreciate their quality...

This place can be a bit difficult to locate but with Google maps every place in an urbanized location is easy to find. It is located on the ground floor of an old-ish South Calcutta home, which kind of takes away the ambiance of a steakhouse to a certain extent. The food is pretty good and the staff are nice and helpful. The setting owing to the old style of architecture is a bit strange and the music they play has a really wide spectrum raning from Green Day to Frank Sinatra.

The steaks are nice, though I'd pick Wise Owl Steakhouse between the two. The pulled pork sandwich is pretty impressive here. I also the the pork chops. I am keen to give the ham steak as try as well. The Italian dishes in my opinion are nothing to write home about. 

All in all a nice steak place. And not that expensive either.

This visit started off as a peace offering by my fianc√© and boy was I impressed.  Loved the food, the quaint ambience. I had the bhekti steak and was wonderfully flaky and everything amazing.  The place is a little small and therefore getting a seating may be difficult but definitely worth visiting.

I went here on a republic day evening for a steak....it was holiday and we had this place in mind for some tim e now. I was a pleasant experience.

Food:  We had ordered a factory mixed grill for starters, it was bland, more than a grill should be I thought. We had a tenderloin steak and ham steak for our main course. Food quantity felt adequate and well garnished and can't complain about the taste as well. Finally we had a brownie with ice cream n hit chocolate sauce which tasted really good !!  But the quantity is less so not recommended for sharing.

Service: Its was good , the place is small as their other outlets and no problems getting attention of the staff.

Ambiance: Atmosphere was quite cozy and great music , right of my playlist! Good for a quiet evening away from Kolkata's hustle n bustle.

Verdict: Of course recommend this place to fellow foodies for a date or evening with friends if ur date/friends are meat lovers with no prejudices.

A good joint for continental and Italian delicacies. We ordered cream of chicken soup, grilled chicken and mix factory grill. Mix factory grill was spot on, grilled chicken could have had a bit of more seasoning. But the cream of chicken soup was bland and tasteless. It tasted more of raw flour. But the ambience was impressive, and whatever we ordered was served piping hot.

The hype attracted us. But we were terribly disappointed. The chicken n fish starters were ok. The pork chop was mostly lard. The sauce in almost 3 mains were strikingly similar and boring. The quality of chicken, n pork were less than ordinary. The desserts were also below average.

Pleasant decor. Small accommodation. My pal n i went to check it out as we are meat crazy people and the menu looked pretty neat. Was disappointed as they had neither t-bone nor pork ribs. Had to settle for a tenderloin and pork chops. Coming to the food, I ordered the steak to be medium rare. I got a well done steak instead. The pork chops had hardly any searing. The herb combinations were good in both the sauces. It is a bold effort trying to be a steakhouse in Kolkata but given the amount of international exposure our generation has gathered, they definitely need to pull up their socks as far as quality and methods are concerned. Definitely worth giving a shot as it is pleasant break from the mundane food scene of Kolkata

It was pure nostalgia that made me trek down to this outlet as it is housed in premises where I had spent many childhood vacations and high school days.

Located in a residential area, I could park easily. The interiors are made in the American style casual dining theme, with Spartan furniture. The old residential building has been converted with minimal intervention and rather economically. The menu card was long, offering a variety. But many exotic offerings of sea food were not available.

I went for a Chicken Sizzler; my family went for a Vegetable Sizzler and a Ham Steak, with some ginger bread on the side. The presentation of food was typical. The Chicken sizzler had a topping of vegetables and sauce. The sauce however was under cooked and the tomato and ginger maintained their independent identities. After having worked my way through the topping of vegetables and sauce, when I reached the core of meat, I found it to be stale. I tried a helping of the ham steak; it tasted ok. The vegetable sizzler was cantered around a mixed vegetable chop, which my wife found to be tasty.

The service was good and friendly. At just over Rs. 1300/- for three, it is moderately priced. But anyone who is not burdened with the problem of parking may as well go the Park Street and adjoining areas for much better offerings of same genre at similar prices.

I have tastes many steak from various restaurant, but this time got a recommendation from a friend, so want to taste there flavour with one of my friend.....
Location - Well it is a 5-10min walk from Kalighat metro...located at Southern Avenue...will recommend for to use ur GPS , if r going there for the first time..
Ambience - Very good and decent look restaurant..stuffs are helpful to select ur dish according to your taste...
Menu- We ordered Crispy chilly pork, two Factory special Cheese Steak and Virgin Mojito.
Well as a starter item, I think the chilly pork is there is more than any spicy starter flavour you expect.....really crispy in bite nd they put some real chilly flavour into it, which makes this dish mouth watering.....
Lets come to the main course, Factory special Cheese Steak...there is three variety available for this dish-Beef, Ham and Chicken...we order the Beef variety,,,, What would I say,well I'll jst say, it is one of the best steak I tried..,mouth watering, tender and juicy....potato mash is average in flavour but the onion ring fry and the gravy is jst out of the world.......strongly recommend it...
Virgin Mojito - Umm, as a side drink, it is not bad....fresh and the flavour of mint leaves are enough to cut out your tiredness......
Pricing - Well with those above mention dishes , the bill was nearly around 1.3k, which I think decent enough with the quality of food the restaurant provide.....

Its an old house converted into an American style steak house. The decor is very nice but the tables are very small and are placed too close to each other which gives you a crampy feeling. The ambiance is still good and the staff are courteous.

Talking about the most important thing, the food, is very good. everything we¬† had, had a distinct taste. Starting from the salads, steaks, sizzlers, lamb ragout everything was nice, except the tenderloin steak (buffalo meat, so called beef here). We ordered for the desserts as well, which were again good.

I will surely re-visit this place for the sake of some well made dishes they serve.

After visiting its New Alipore outlet a year back, I have been dying to visit this branch (heard its better) and voila! Its the best I must say! Never have I tasted such a steak which is so damn tasty!! It even outdoes the Olypub's one!¬†

I ordered the famous Factory Special Cheese Steak which was so good, I might even visit there again this week! I even got the smell of the burnt charcoal which is so rare in nowadays' steaks! A friend of mine took Spicy chicken strips which was equally delicious as I couldn't help try that from her too! :D Do try their desserts. Its yum!

Coming to its decor..its wonderful! Ambience is calm and soothing with a touch of western classics!! Reminded me of all those western cowboy movies I watched in my childhood! The service was quick. The waiters were very cordial and asked whether everything was up to the mark, which I found very generous and warm!¬†

Though the food is very costly but its heavenly taste is worth every penny of yours!! No wonder one should indulge in such delicacies quite often! It's sure to tickle your senses!!

So what's stopping you?? Bon Appe'tit !!

My parents and I visited this steakhouse on my mother's birthday for a quiet dinner. It's located on a quiet corner but it's not really all that hard to find. The decor struck me the minute I walked in. Lamps over every table, classic pictures on textured walls and quaint tables are eyecandy. We were handed a menu and it took us a very very long time to decide what we wanted because everything sounded so good. Finally, we asked for the bacon wrapped prawns for a starter, a chellow kabab, a mixed grill and a pork chop with french fries. The bacon wrapped prawns came fairly quickly and I dug in at once but was grossly disappointed. As beautiful as the bacon was, the prawns were hardly cooked at all. They were still kind of gray and had that uncooked smell and did not quite have us a expecting a good meal. However, the main course did not disappoint at all. The chellow kabab was excellent, with generous pieces of meat, fluffy butter rice and a sunny side up egg, while the mixed grill had cocktail sausages, portions of lamb, pieces of mutton, button mushrooms and saut√©ed vegetables bathed in a delicious sauce. The pork chop was the highlight of the night. Good, large portion of healthy meat with a good layer of fat is something we would all like our steaks to have. I was not disappointed. The sauce was absolutely delicious and had an impeccably balanced flavour. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the french fries were absolutely perfect and not at all grainy. Grainy potatoes are nightmarish for me. We finished off with Chocolate Monte Carlo because the chocolate souffl√© was not available, unfortunately. Nevertheless, the Monte Carlo was amazing with oodles of ice cream, delicious sponge cake and chocolate sauce topped with a cherry (without the seed, thankfully) and chocolate chips. The meal would have been a 10/10 if only the prawns were cooked. Service is prompt and staff here is very friendly. I definitely recommend a visit.

I decided to drop in here this christmas with a friend of mine.The ambiance is nice.It's a nice and cozy restaurant.We had ordered bacon wrapped prawns,the tenderloin steak and chicken permegiana.The bacon wrapped prawns were ¬†really good though the dip it came with did not impress me much.I would have to say that the dish was much on the saltier side.The tenderloin steak was nice.The chicken permegiana was a tad bit overcooked.Both the dishes came with a side of mashed potatoes which were under-seasoned and boiled veggies(which came in really really poor quantity).I would have given it a 3 for the food.But I'm giving it a 3.5 taking the ambiance into account.
N.B(i)Their playlist is amazing.
N.B(ii)They should definitely work on their washroom,probably provide an actual door instead of just a curtain.

To be specific a nice place with proper prices of the items served.
Very very nice ambience but the space is very less i.e. it's a place you go with 1 or 2 people not more. Quality of food is also very good rather to say it's just the yard stick of the of the price we pay for it. After this comes the service which was also very very good like we were confused in what to order and the waiter helped us in ordering.
Now to be true we were confused only because we pre determined to have an item which we saw in the menu over the internet. Once we visited the place they said they don't have that item it was not only a single item but many items which were there on the menu in internet was not available. I would ask the management to upload the recent menu which is available in the outlet.

Have been here twice and the first time it took us hours to find this place since it was new. The ambience and decor is sexy! Have tried the patent chicken steak which is quite good. The ham steak was a bit hard and there was a dish which had fish and it was really bad. The chicken ala Kiev wasn't up to the mark as well. If you visit this place just for chicken steak, it'd be perfect, otherwise it has been a turn off when we tried other stuffs.

Location- Located in lake place this is a hidden gem and hard to find unless you are not very much used to southern avenue's lanes. If you are coming from golpark side you need to get into the lane of menoka. From menoka cinema hall take a  right go till the end of the lane and again take a left. After walking for a min you will see the steak factory

Ambiance and decor-  This place is dimly lit with awesome posters in the walls. The best part is their collection of music. Steak with hard rock music.. It was just perfect .

Food ordered- 1) Nachos with cheese and salsa dip 
2) Ham steak 3) Factory mixed grill 4) Chelow kebab

Food quantity and quality- The nachos was served with cheese and salsa dip. Nachos was okay but cheese dio was preety ordinary. The salsa dip was less in quantity but the taste was awesome.
The ham steak was very well prepared in sauces and was served with vegetabkes.. french fries and mashed potatoes.
The chelow kebab was good but not extra ordinary. We have peter cat which is still regaining in this area.
Factory mixed grill was too good which was prepared with kakori,lamb,chicken sausage,mushrooms,chicken and served with french fries and vegetables which is highly recommended from my side.

We thought for dessert but we were too much full to try it out. I will try them later.
All main course is enough for one!!

Staffs- Staffs was couteous and service was mediocre.

This place can steal your heart in every possible way. Located in a peaceful area and the ambiance being simple and neat, this can be good for a friends' hangout or lovely date.
We started our food session with bacon wrapped prawn. cocktail sausage and spicy chili pork. The seasoning and spices were perfect for each one. Just that ¬†would have appreciated a drier version of the pork.
Next we ordered tenderloin steak and chicken steak. The steak tastes good, though the meat is a little tough to manage with the pork. A softer version will be more preferred I guess. The mashed potato deserves a little more butter and seasoning
The chicken steak was great
Chicken Ala-kiev was good too.

A Dessert is free for every two main-course, which is a pretty good deal.
We had chocolate brownies and chocolate monte-carlo and they beautifully created a happy-ending

Will go back again for more

Went with a group of friends. Our first visit @ The Steak Factory. It was a moderate walk from Kalighat Metro station( aided by Google maps).Fortunately we didn't have to wait to be seated.
THE PLACE:- The decor and the ambience was pretty good (being a Brian Adams fan, I loved the songs that the stereos played), the seats were comfortable. The guy taking our order was decent and told us before hand that for the food to arrive, we would have to wait about 40mins.

THE FOOD:

TENDERLOIN STEAK:- My first beef steak. We opted for medium and not rare. The meat was soft and juicy and the reduced sauce was pretty good. The blend of spice was nice which could be felt every time we took a bite.

SMOKED CHICKEN & MUSHROOM RISOTTO:- My first risotto, and, I must say I enjoyed it.... The consistency was nice and the flavours balanced. The rice did have a smokey flavor which was evenly masked by the sauce.

CHELOW KABAB:- This dish let me down personally. The rice as mentioned in the menu was "buttered rice", but it really lacked the "butter" part. The mutton kebab, was nice...spicy... But the chicken bit wasn't to my liking.

MIXED FACTORY GRILL:- I had a bit of chciken with the veggies and the sauce... Quite tasty.

We also ordered, chciken steak, blue lagoon and pinacolada.

This place was on my list for a long time amd I finally managed to visit this place on the last day of 2015. My friend and I ordered onion rings, spicy chilli pork and the factory mixed grill. The dishes were quite good. Personally I liked the spicy chilli pork most. Space seems to be the only issue as we had some trouble in adjusting the plates on the table.

It's all about meat here, obviously! Uncompromising, raw and gruesome chunks of meat served in the most delectable way! The service was top notch- prompt and friendly. Ambiance, well, nothing better than some hard hitting American punk and classic rock n' roll music to go along with your steak, right? We ordered chicken steak, pork chop and mixed grill, all of which were excellent. The only element missing here was beer, which could have easily rocketed this food joint to the top of everyone's priority list.¬†

Would definitely come back here!

overall an adorable place that offers variety in steaks to satisfy meat cravings. With an American touch, this continental resto is decked up in sophisticated style & tranquil ambiance. & good food is accompanied here by soft music, specially those of pinkfloyed¬† & coldplay (my favorites, which is why i liked this place). 
but unfortunately when we happened to be here we found some vital items unavailable. however, what we got was quite awesome - our ham steak, chicken charcoal steak, risotto, spaghetti-meat ball,&¬† yes the desserts - some apple pie & chocolate Monte-carlo.

Went on christmas and found the place full to its capacity. Thankfully the staff got us a 4 seater within a few minutes. The restaurant is a small one but well maintained with really good numbers playing in the background. Coming to food, we ordered beacon wrapped prawns, 2 pork chops , 2 ham steak , tenderloin steak and few coolers. Service was a bit slow but the food was delicious especially ham steak amd pork chop. I am definitely trying these two again. A good place for steak lovers :)

Located in a quiet little lane of Southern Avenue, this cozy nook is an absolute meatlovers delight. The Lamb Ragout we ordered was a generous portion of mutton pieces and mushroom n bell peppers in the most delicious red wine sauce, with mashed potatoes n vegetables on the side. The Chiken Steak was no disappointment either.

Before visiting this diner I had heard a lot about it, so today I visited this place. The ambience and interiors are satisfactory. Service is good....now coming to the main part the reason why I went was for some good food. But what I experienced was completely unexpected. We ordered chicken steak and tetrazzini.
The chicken wasn't tender at all...it was dry and bland. The sauce was nice but the chicken was hard to swallow...the tetrazzini was pain in taste...needed more cheese....and the spaghetti was not cooked well enough....
I would like to visit again but it's a request to the owner/management to look after the food quality.

We went to this place with high expectations...but was disappointed. For starters we ordered bacon wrapped prawns... Though the portions were sufficient..but it was unevenly cooked...inside was totally raw. Moving on to the main course..we ordered ham steak and factory mixed grill. The ham steak was blunt..and dry... the mixed grill at least had seasonings.
The service was very slow... Took almost 30-45 mins .
The only good part was the ambience. Nice cosy seating arrangements and good music. But the food was such a let down

Wanted to visit this place for quite sometime now. To start with the ambience was perfect. The dim lights and some amazing English music sets the perfect mood. We ordered the chicken steak which was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked served with a poach and crispy French fries. Pot roasted mutton is a recommendation I would definitely like to make. It was accompanied with a generous amount of rice and the mutton was cooked in a perfectly consistent sauce. Dessert here is offered complimentary if you order two main courses. This is most definitely the icing on the cake.
Loved the place and looking forward to visiting here again. Utsab Banerjee

I think this place is really underrated,its deserves a rating well above 4 to say the least.
This place has an amazing decor and the music is really good.
We had chicken steak and pot roasted mutton. The quantity of the mutton was really good so was the rice. The sauce was just amazing,though i feel the rice could have been a bit better,but its judging them by their standards. Amazing dish overall i thought,but then came the steak blew me away. Beautifully prepared and with the egg and everything,it was just perfect. The taste is still with me hours after I left. The complimentary desert was really the icing on the cake,we left a little too full to say the least.
Maybee its not 5 good but its way better than 3.9 for sure,but more importantly I have no complaints whatsoever so why not give them a full.
Definitely a place you should try out,it would definitely meet your meat craving.

being a steak fan,  I would say they make it real good. had the factory special beef steak which had a molten cheese topping which adds a different zing to it.. but then again u can scoop out the cheese and have it separately.. the sauce could have been a wee bit better.. had a gr8 swiss salad as a starter.
cozy ambience to meet with ur gang, have an adda session and dine..

Steak factory i have to say does not really stand up to its name and hype. This place was on my list for a while and then one fine day i dropped in to try their steaks. 
We were quickly seated by the staffs and they were very courteous. We ordered for the bacon wrapped prawn as starter and chicken steak and the mutton steak. The waiters were prompt in taking orders but delivery was slow as hell. I thought the wait would be worthwhile but alas, the quality of the food was pretty poor. The steaks tasted bland and stale and even their mashed  potato failed miserably. The bacon wrapped prawn was ok but overtly chewy. I thought i was gonna choke eating it. The chicken steak  was still better in comparison to the mutton. Such a waste of money. I somehow managed to swallow the mains and went for their desserts hoping that would make  my day. So i ordered for monte carlo.  However that was a myth because even their dessert had a stale smell and the crust was hard like it happens when you store food for way too long and the freshness is lost.

The ambiance is good and has a bit international feel when it comes to decor and music but food was lower than average.

We just randomly went to this place just because we saw the board on one of our random "kolkata exploration spree". 
The ambiance: an old house transformed beautifully into an American style eatery, with really good music playing. Posters of old English classic movies hanging on the walls. 
A small place though.
What we ordered:
1. Gnocchi in cream and spinach sauce: It was a very well made dish. The gnocchi was perfectly done, complimented by a cheesy, creamy and spinach based sauce. Overall- 4 out of 5 for this one.
2. Charcoal grilled veg steak: Honestly, it was a bit disappointing. The dish had the following elements
A. A veg Patty topped with a house sauce.
B. Vegetables on the side.
C. Mashed potatoes.
The Patty was the only good thing about the dish. The sauce, a little too tangy. " Imbalance of flavours" was written all over it.
Well, I like stir fried vegetables in a dish like this. This had only boiled vegetables, very few of them infact.(picture attached). That was a turn off. As far as the mashed potatoes were concerned. It wasn't tasty at all. It's pretty hard to screw something as simple as mashed potatoes, and they did that quite successfully.
Il still give it a 3 for the amazing ambiance and the gnocchi in spinach and cream sauce.

Rarely cooked tenderloin steak with mashed potato and vegetables was rare in true sense and yummy to the core. Really rare in kolkata too. A saturday evening at The steak factory was worth it!! 
This place has a good ambience and a decor with nostlagic music. Service stuffs are good but not the best. Factory special mixed grill sizzler was very indian. Chicken parmigiana was good but was bit smoky and over fried. 
Though Monte Carlo was awesome, the cappuccino is most horrible in town.
However should not forget to mention about their international style menu board. <3ed it üòç

their Factory special chicken Cheese Steak  and Ham Steak.
The Service is as friendly as they can be especially when they have so many hungry and possibly Hangry diners to deal with üòù. Only One thing I badly miss whenever I came to this place is nice Chilled Beer to wash it down!! üòú

Visited this outlet for dinner, decor very tastefully done with posters of old movies, very american feel, even the table decor. Its located on the ground floor of an old house hence washroom isnt up to the mark but otherwise seating area is good. It has free wifi and plays music. Starter was stuffed tandoori chicken leg, tasted good but not stuffed, piece also was small in size. Also ordered spiced bubbles(cold drink with extra fizz). Mains were Smoked chicken n mushroom risotto and chicken steak and chicken parmigiana. Risotto was disappointing as it lacked the creaminess with cheese, rice used was not risotto rice and the greens in risotto spoiled the taste. Rest 2 chicken dishes tasted good but not great. Parmigiana was just deep fried crispy chicken fillet, hence no extra flavour of seasoning or batter. We found the dishes served a lil less value for money. Overall it was good experience but maybe we will think of coming back again to try a few more dishes.

In main course we had California fish and a meat steak..both were good. Specially the fish. The order to service time is high, but the waiters are friendly and polite... Overall would like to visit again to try the other highlights on the menu

The steak factory had been on my shortlist for God knows how long.. It took forever for me to finally come here.. I had light dinner with my family and didn't order much as we were already full from before.
Started off with Shirley Temple, Blue Lagoon and Jungle Juice for the three of us.. The blue lagoon tasted average, mostly like flavored sprite, my Shirley Temple was full of ginger, was okayish, personally didn't like it.. The jungle juice was more of a mixed fruit juice than a mocktail.. So needless to say, we didn't enjoy the drinks much.. 
We went straight to the main course, without any starters.. We had fish and chips, which again was pretty average; I had much better fish and chips in other joints.. My Lamb Lasagna was very good, I felt the lamb could have been more tender, but the lasagna was excellent.. While I had no issues with the taste, the meat could definitely have been better.. 
The last main course was Baked Chicken Ala Neapolitan.. It was by far the best dish among the three, the base was of egg, and tasted brilliant with the sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy, and it was the only dish I didn't have any complaint with.. 
We had a Chocolate Monte Carlo, because Chocolate Souffle was not available; the dessert was well made, though it would not stand out among the best desserts I have had in the past few months..

Note: We didn't go for their Pork Ribs or Steaks mainly because we had a small appetite, and wanted to try something different.. The said dishes are certainly not their signature dishes, but I expected better from them.. The pocket pinch also, was not negligible, and overall, I would say there are much better options out there. 
However, even after this, I would still visit again, one more time, to try out their more traditional Steaks, Ribs and Pork Chops.

If you're planning to enjoy an appetizing steak without digging deep into your pockets, this is the place for you. The Steak Factory had been a lofty presence in my wishlist for a long time. Once the opportunity to grab a bite from one of Calcutta's steak specialists arose, i didn't hesitate twice. Located at about 10 mins from Menoka Cinema hall,this place is an eye catcher inspite of not being one of the most embellished of places.
I had gone there to have the Barbeque Pork Ribs. I just had to taste it once after reading so much about it in the reviews here. To my utmost misfortune though,they didn't have the pork ribs. I was disappointed but they wanted me to try out some other pork preparation so i went for the ham steak. My girl had planned to have the Factory special chicken cheese steak from before.
They took about 20 minutes to bring us the food but didn't take us long to finish it off because it was too delicious . The ham steak had about 2 average and 1 big slices of ham nicely seasoned with veggies (Though I'd have loved a bit more) while the cheese chicken steak was all about the cheese dripping (Heaven for the cheese lovers).
We went for the apple pie for the dessert and indeed it was a the sweetest of cherries on top of the cake.
The Steak Factory is a definite must go.

The Steak Factory had been on my wishlist for a long, long time now and I finally managed to visit the place today for an early dinner and it turned out to be everything I had expected it to be. The Steak Factory, located in one of the nice neighbourhoods of Southern Avenue will automatically draw your attention to it if you visit in the evening, courtesy of the bright yellow fairy lights adorning the windows. 
Absolutely living up to it's name, The Steak Factory is every meat lover's delight. We had ordered the Factory Special Chicken Cheese Steak, Ham Steak and soft drinks to wash it down with. We had originally ordered the Barbeque Pork Ribs Steak instead of the Ham Steak but it was not available. The Chicken Cheese Steak was Enchanting with a capital E, but I thought the Ham Steak needed a lil more seasoning. Nonetheless, it was good, but I'd recommend to go for the Chicken Cheese Steak over it any day. 
For dessert, we asked for the Apple Pie with Vanilla Icecream  and was completely blown away by its taste.
Coming to the ambience and decor, I loved it absolutely, even though the place is small. The soft lights, the posters of Hollywood movies and personalities on the walls-from Gone With The Wind to Woody Allen to Taxi Driver to Elvis Presley to John Lennon- they have it all, the framed menu, the wooden flooring, the retro English music everything gives off a vibe akin to that of an early English diner. Only thing that would cheer up the feel to this already pleasant place a lot more is if they had more friendly servers. It's not that they are inefficient or impolite but they all seem really depressed with this smug expression on their faces. 
Even so, I really loved this place and I'm definitely going back to taste the other items on their innovative menu. They also have some pretty good offers going during their happy hours which sadly, is only during weekdays.

I'm writing this review on my 2nd visit at this nice small home turned restaurant with my friend at lake place. One of the nicest ambience i have seen, with great collection of music this place is a must go. We have ordered blue lagoon, virgin mary, lamb lasagna and factory special cheese steak. Except virgin mary we had a good time with our other food n drinks. Service was quicker than last time, surprisingly quantity of food also increased this time which made me quite happy.. And one last thing to mention, free Wifi for everyone. Those who are looking for new taste and different meat, they should try this restaurant atleast once.

On the occasion of Kali puja my friend & I decided to hit this place as a part of our monthly food hangout for our lunch. It was easy to locate this place(just take the lane before menoka's lane if you are going towards southern menoka & you would also see a ubi bank branch). So upon reaching there we were quickly seated since it wasn't very crowded. The interiors & decor made a good impression on me & certainly got me excited. I found the menu card very interesting since it resembled to that of a photo frame. So after going through the menu,we had the long list of following items:-

1. Blue lagoon- Very refreshing drink with the perfect balance of sweet & sour.

2. Iced lemon tea- Typical icy lemon tea which was taken by my friend. It went well with food.

3. Factory mixed grill- A plate of meat pieces consisting of chicken,sausages,lamb in a salty gravy with capsicums,onions,sauteed veggies & french fries. The dish was filling & the gravy gave a unique taste which went well with the meat pieces. One can try if they are confused with their long menu.

4. California fish- This dish was a let down in terms of it's taste. The fish was properly cooked but the sauce & pepper just didn't go well together & also the outer crusty skin of the fish gave it a bit odd texture. Herb sticky rice tasted great with the sauce. Overall a thumbs down!!

5. Nachos with cheese- Typical nachos served with warm cheese & salsa. Nachos were properly made & had the perfect crunch to them.

6. Shrimp cocktail- I'm allergic to prawns & shrimps but still decided to try it out because the name sounded very interesting. The presentation of the dish looked appetising but that's that. The creamy cheese overpowered the whole dish & I somehow managed to gulp one spoonful of it.

7. Caramel custard- Another let down which made disappointed us. The caramel sauce was very runny & it was too sweet for our liking.

8. Chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream- This dish was the saving grace of meal. At first i wanted to try their souffle but then i was informed that it wasnt available. Big delicious piece of rectangular shape brownie served with chocolate sauce which the vanilla ice cream complimented so so well.

The total bill came upto 1922. To sum it all up I wasn't very convinced with the food experience after going through the reviews from other foodies. The service took time & often we saw the persons being inattentive. Judging by today's experience I don't think I would be going there again but I wish that could change in the near future.

The decor is very nice... Not dashing but slightly new in the fell it provides... The food was quite good but there is surely some room for improvement. The batter in the fried items are too thick which doesn't go with the soft fish underneath. More the salad has a strong taste which doesn't complement the subtle taste of the buttered rice and chicken items. But the sea food Alfredo is very nice though it has more calamari than prawn. But the deserts are fantastic

So finally my friends n I decided to visit this place for lunch today. The decor and menu was quite unique and nice. There were 7 of us so we ordered 2 starters,bacon wrapped prawns and spicy meat balls. The latter of the 2 suited our palate better. We ordered 6 main course dishes and got 2 free. These were the chicken steak,tenderloin steak,grilled chicken steak,lamb lasagna,factory special mixed grill,pot roasted mutton and factory special chicken cheese steak. The chicken cheese steak was the best of d lot. Grilled chicken,lamb lasagna and mixed grill were also nice. All in all quite reasonably priced too considering the amount given.

I'm almost a regular visitor in this outlet as I am hooked to the "Tenderloin Steak". If you are a red meat freak like me this is a must visit joint. ¬†Besides the steaks they even serve good pastas. But I will recommend you the "Tenderloin Steak" with a portion of Garlic bread. Nice ambiance, soothing music and good food and neat service. What else do you need after a hard day's work ? Rush in ...

** The giant framed menu card will make the first impression I bet !! :)

Chicken leg could have a better stuffing...but the desserts were again pleasing...way to go

Expectations were high.. but I'm disappointed.. ambience is good.. food is pretty mediocre.. ordered fish n chips.. menu card says bhetki fish but they served basa.. when asked the answer is cold and casual.. cheaters..

chelo kebab was also unimpressive.. kebab was not soft either.. so a big disappointment.. 
summary.. Peter Cat is the palce for Chelo kebabs..

Have tried every thing on menu except drinks, and each stands perfect.My favourite however is chicken steak. Their chello kabab is even better than peter cat. Grilled chicken however can be better. Pork chop is a must try for every pork lover.

D√©cor is very sweet.

So this one was on my list for a long time and on Nabami afternoon when we were exhausted from Pandal hoping, we happen to cross this place and jumped at the opportunity.

Ambiance: Very Comfy feel and the free WiFi is a nice addition to the comfort

Food: Well due to puja rush they like others have a shorter version of the Menu with a bit of delay in service but that didnt mean in no way a compromised on the standard. I ordered Fish & Chips and it was just Yum. The quality of fish was really fresh and nice. ¬†

We also ordered Chicken Steak which was also good, so was the mixed grill & grilled fish.¬†

Food was a 4/5, Service 3.5/5, Ambiance 4/5, Menu 3.5/5

Went there@astami(durga puja). The food was really sad,  we ordered bacon wrapped prawn and the prawn was smelly, not fresh at all. For main course we ordered tenderloin steak which was below average, it was not written in the menu that it was a cold cut,yet we got a solid icy slab of poor quality ham, the sauce was awful and the mixed platter was no good. Basically everything tasted the same. High hopes shattered :( The only positive bit was that we had some great selfies@restuarant :p
Not repeating for sure.

A proper streak joint in city was I always wanted. 
Food, the ambience, the politeness, music, decoration, just amazing.
Grilled sausage, mutton steak , garlic bread,  apple pie, lime soda ...
I wanted to have another streak but alas! I was full.
Anyways, visiting soon.

Its a Compact Restaurant that is situated in a calm locality . It's ambience is excellent that builds up your expectation towards the food. When coming to the food , streaks are good but that built high expectations weren't met. There are other food options that one can try . overall a good experience.

Keep calm and eat steak ‚úå !!
That is the motto of The Steak Factory . The particular one visited my me today is situated near menoka cinema hall at lake place. A little confusing location , this tiny restaurant is tucked away in a corner with a visible board .  Tiny and cute but at the same time it's not congested. The walls are beautiful with typical european styled red and white wallpaints. Then the giant framed menu card came and it impressed me. All the items were mentioned there. I ordered a californian fish steak for myself and chicken steak for my friend. Steak was served as usual with sunny side up , veggies and it was accompanied with the choices of either french fries or mashed potato. The fish  (bhetki fillet) steak was delicious in sauce
with buttered rice and saute'ed veggies. I loved my lunch today here. At the end we ordered soft drink and fresh lime soda. This was my first visit and i'll be visiting soon again :)

I visited the restaurant on Ashtami for lunch with my friends. The place being really small, we had to wait for about 35mins before we got our table. We ordered barbeque chicken wings and bacon wrapped prawns for starters. I liked the wings but the bacon in the bacon wrapped prawns was too fatty for my taste. We ordered tenderloin steak and spaghetti with meatballs for the main course. Both of them tasted very good and i would definitely go back to try their other offerings. The service was good and prompt.

The Steak Factory was my destination to satisfy my meat carvings, I have been to the New Alipore joint a couple of times, being satisfied with the quality of the food yesterday visited their Southern Avenue joint for the first time.
The ambience is good and the staff is quite friendly, the major let off is the quality of the food we ordered chello kababs and a sizzler, the chello kabab was a disaster, the rice was of poor quality chicken kabab were hard and difficult to chew
Sizzlers were a bit ok type but not up to the make 
Overall a disappointing experience

Going by the name one would expect brilliant steaks cooked to perfection, sadly that's not the case. On a Sunday they offered a limited menu. I ordered a tenderloin steak and left disappointed.. I requested for medium done however I was served with well done, tough meat.. Total spoiler. The barbeque pork that I ordered for take away, the pork was cooked well but the sauce was yuck..all I could taste was vinegar. The ambience was the only decent thing...

I had heard good things about this place from my friends. Ordered the tenderloin steak and spaghetti with meat balls. The food was pretty good. The problem was the ambience. There seemed to be some obnoxious smell maybe coming from the kitchen which is kind of a turn off. Apart from that it's a good place, do give it a try.

The good:¬†

1. Mac and cheese was decent

The bad:

1. Barbecue wings were disgusting. Just limp floppy pieces of chicken, without any flavor or spice, covered in some sweet sauce. Not properly fried or barbecued or grilled. No crunch, no juiciness, no real taste. The wings were probably steamed. Sauce lacked flavor. Wings were not even dressed properly. Standard practice is to cut the chicken wing into half, push the meat in the drumette up to form a little drumstick, and keep the mid section as a clean separate piece. Here we had to separate the parts of the wings ourselves by hand. It was difficult to see the point of paying for such a gristly, floppy, poor piece of chicken in a restaurant.

2. Mix grill was mostly mushrooms and capsicum. A few scraps of dry, fibrous chicken meat. A couple of minuscule slices of chicken sausage (not even a whole sausage). Some squares of suspicious brown meat that could be either beef or mutton, I couldn't tell because it didn't taste like anything. At first when I saw the plate I thought they had perhaps brought me a "veg" mix grill by mistake, because all I could see were a sea of mushrooms covering everything else. Had to hunt around underneath to find a few scraps of meat. It is clear that the chef here has no idea what a mixed grill is. Oh and it was served cold. This seems more like a plateful of leftover scraps of meat they were saving to feed some dogs than a mix grill.

3. Garlic bread was a joke. No garlic flavor. Just some pieces of dry, tough bread. By far the worst garlic bread I've ever had. The person who made it seems to have never tasted or seen garlic bread.

4. Service was apathetic and confused. Things were brought in the wrong order. I had asked for the mac and cheese to be given as a side dish with the steak. Instead, they brought it as a starter. Had to call several times for water to get refilled. Not a single waiter asked if we liked the food, or seemed to care in the least about our experience. When I gave feedback about how disappointed I was with the mix grill, the waiter tried to give me some gyaan about how this is what a mix grill is. I have had mix grill at many restaurants in Mumbai, Delhi, and Calcutta, and have never seen anything so pathetic. Instead of giving gyaan to customer, why not actually try to listen to their feedback.

I have no idea how this restaurant is in business, or why it has such a high rating in Zomato. They should fire their chef and their service staff and start from scratch. Kolkata foodie standards must have dropped considerably for this to get a 4.0 rating!

The promise of steaks and chops being their specialty is very tempting in a city where a good steak is rare to come by. Add to that some very retro ambience with posters of Woody Allen movies and John Denver songs. Makes for the 1.5 rating! That's where the joy ends though. 

Now, I have spent more than a few years in the state of Texas and I learnt to take my meat very seriously. And I have never encountered such extreme insult of good meat, ever! 

The tenderloin steaks were cut like a school girl would cut into meat - shapeless, uneven thickness and in complete misalignment to the grain of the meat. What passed for medium rare was a step short of becoming crispy to the core! And worst of all, what passed for cheese steak was an off-the-grocery-shelf cheese slice pasted to the side of the abused blob of meat! 

We also ordered a great Kolkata legacy dish - Chelow Kabab, and boy was it bad! The kebabs were tasting pretty weird, the rice was dry. But for the decently laid sunny side up, this was a disaster! Long live Peter-Cat!

We also ordered crispy chilly pork and the sorry pieces of meat were not within driving distance of crispy but had been successfully cooked to the point where you could forget calling them meat and use them for sandpaper after washing off the overdose of soy sauce!

The meat balls - oh dear! Someone needs to tell the chef the distance between meat pakora and meat balls is a few continents! Who uses besan coating to make meat balls!!

The only moderately edible dish was the grilled fish as I think it was fresh! Even there it was made soggy by an over cheesed white sauce poured over it in an uncalled for overdo! So it was just moderate, at best! 

There could have been some redemption in the accompaniments but the mashed potato tasted weird, the beans and carrots and French fries were lack luster and cold. The Carbonara was tasteless, powdery and quite inedible. 

This place came very highly recommended and it disappointed me quite seriously! 

This place is like one of the low points of culinary disasters - with a chef, or whoever is entrusted with cooking, who lacks technical know how and possibly any measure of expertise in cooking meat! The decimation of food on the plate is absolute with no chance for redemption. For all those who have rated this place highly, with all due respect, I feel sorry! If this is the benchmark for good, there's a whole world out there waiting unexplored!

Being a real value for money kind of guy I wouldn't necessarily go around recommending this to everyone all the time, but this place does certainly have an appeal... from the decor to the staff to the food, everything is nice!!! the prices are, what i would normally say, on the higher side. But the quality is good. Free wifi is an added bonus. Having ordered the tenderloin, the ham and the chicken steaks, we were well satisfied upon finishing our meal. When the food first came we were left a bit disappointed on the quantity of food on the plates, but on finishing we realized that its not bad, its just enough. The kind of quantity that manages to satisfy regular level hunger without making you feel bloated. The gravies on the steaks were a somewhat mixed bag. The gravy on the tenderloin steak, while not bad, had more pepper than I would have liked. The chicken steak gravy was just not pleasant. But the ham steak gravy was nice.... like really good. The grilled chicken, which we had also ordered, was good while not being outstanding. On the whole- a nice small place which i would recommend to anyone who asks about it, but wouldn't necessarily bring up on my own.

Though space is limited and one has to wait outside at times.

Got a salad of a bit of basic sausage and boiled chicken and two tiny half-inch pieces of lamb when I asked for mixed grill. The plate was covered only with capsicum chunks. And the bacon wrapped prawns had stale prawn and a thick sickening chunk of fat-filled bacon around each prawn. The bacon was in fact only fat. I can understand that the Durga Pujo time can increase the pressure on the restaurant staff but that does not mean that you rob customers. Pathetic experience.

I am heart broken guys.. u absolutely ruined my nabami lunch. After reading so many good reviews in zomato, I decided to go there today. In zomato reviews I have seen people praise this dish "Grilled chicken " . How can that be possible? I swear on whomever u want me to swear on... grilled chicken is the WORST thing I have ever tasted in my life. I had lunch today at 2 and I am still feeling sick about it. I asked the waiter what the hell did he put in it ? He said white cheese sauce or something. But how can that be so bad man ? How is it possible for "Grilled chicken" dish to be so so so disgustingly bad?
I ordered chicken steak and pasta but nothing matters besides this grilled chicken of urs. Not even the fact that I have to shell 1000rs for this kind of meal.

While writing this review I am still feeling sick just by thinking about that grilled chicken of urs. I can still taste that disgusting thing in my mouth. What the hell did u put in it ? Pls pls tell me. How can it be so bad ? Never again bro. Never ever going back to this place again !

Well been there on the Astami 2015 for a special dinner after puja pandal hopping.
Reached the location by 9 and after a waiting time of 25 mins I got a couple seat for me and my partner. I also came to know waiting time was higher as much as 1 hr for groups ranging 4 - 6 people.

Coming to the food, we ordered mutton steak, chellow kabab and chocolate brownie for desert. Quality was good and tasted very nice. But the quantity to price ratio was below par. Also the mutton sheek kabab in chellow kabab was very very dry and not at all tenderly. The mutton steak was really tasty and that is all the good part. Quantity was very small and it felt pricey too much.

Service was prompt and people were polite. Ambiance was nice and cozy.

But it is definitely a bad pocket pinch. I will go for legendary restaurant at Park street instead.

Maybe recommended for meat lovers but no second time for me.

And we were clearly not happy with the food. The mushroom sauce of the steak was too blant, the steak was veerrrrrry small won't even suit a single person..
The wings were soggy, bt sauce was yumm
Service was promt ..
Price is on the higher side, and didn't find it value for money...

Small and dimly lit, this place has a nice ambience with good music playing in the background.

Ordered Chicken, Ham and Pork steaks plus Grilled Chicken Steak and they looked really small but when you start digging in, it's really more than enough for one.

The Chicken Steak was nice and tasty but the sauce was really sour. They givr french fries and some vegetables as well accompanying it.

The Grilled Chicken Steak has 4 pieces and has a nice seasoning done. The best of the lot.

The bill amounted to 1407 after taxes and of what i feel, it's quite okay. So if you love meat and steaks, this is the place to go.

PLUS. THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI. :D

1 point taken just cause of the small place it is in.. And for the place it is situated in..
Otherwise.. It was another awesome journey for me thru the restaurants of Kolkata.. Pujas mein to had to visit a new place..
And the place didn't disappoint me on the food and the order speed and the service..even at peak hours..
Though i wanted to try the chef's special but alas it wasn't available during the pujas..
I went with my group of friends.. And we ordered a starter first.. BBQ wings.. It was really awesome.. 
Then we divided ourselves in grp of 2 and ordered what we wanted but ofc i tasted 4m every1..
My grp first.. We ordered tenderloin steak medium(yep, i just ate beef.. Sue me.. It was awesm *_*)
And factory cheese (ham) steak.. And chicken tandoori.. God i can eat.. :-P
Then took a bit of chelo kebab(no match for the peter cat chelo) and something which tasted good but 4got the name.. Just like i 4got to take pix..silly me..
Another grp gave me pork chops(plz nvr evr order this,total fat and money wasted) and factory mixed grill..which agn was pretty nice..
Loved the food except few and tasted beef.. At last :-P :-)

Visited this place around a week back. A cozy restaurant carved out of a residential flat I believe and nicely done. Interiors minimal changes have been done so if you look around while you wait for your food you may feel at home.
Ordered Bacon wrapped prawns which were a delight to have. The sauce was simply out of this world. A must try if you visit this place
Also had Chicken parmigiana which was equally good but portion size i feel was little small as compared to what we Indians eat. But tasted fabulous.

Looking forward to visiting this place again when in Kolkata

This outlet of the steak factory is located in the by lanes of Southern Avenue. The place is very cosy with and during rush one might have to wait in a queue. The ambience is very nice with colorful walls , posters of rock bands and a good playlist of songs. The food menu was a curtailed for Puja but it was pretty good.
We started off with Golden friend Mushrooms which came with a dip of mayo and mustard mixed together. The dish was nice. Chicken Nuggets was next with tartar sauce and tasted pretty good. Crispy Fried Calamari followed and was very good. A bit oily but it was a lot of orders so I understand that. We also shared fish and chips, which is typically a main course item, but who cares. It came with two fried filets and tasted amazing.
Main course comprised of one of the best pork chops I've had. Ham steak, blackened fish and a pujo special chello kebab. Just the sheer pork fat is to die for. And The blacked fish was good too.
Desert comprised of a disappointing apple pie and a nice caramel custard. Overall a big lunch for 2 hours and a tummy full of memories. Do give a try to this place. Overall 4/5.

Went to celebrate the Choturthi of Durga Puja to this place, I was absolutely enamoured with it. The place is not very difficult to pin-point yet could be a little tricky spot.

Anyway we had ordered steaks and pastas. We had planned to put more orders, but in midstream we did realize we just couldn't gulp down any more.

The taste is awesome, the entire decor is quite American hence cool with a throbbing music running behind. I loved the seats, the different types of sauces, the lamps and what not.

The service there is excellent and the affordability with respect to this place is high.

And then we ordered a chocolate brownie which was as hard as a rock . yes. But they changed it when we told them and the next time it was really good . overall it was an okay. Not too good neither too bad.

Location: Southern Avenue. It's in one of the bylanes. Hard to explain over Plain text.

Ambiance: Two rooms have been converted into an eatery. I like the setup. Though its small,its good. NOT AT ALL A PLACE FOR VEGETARIANS . Hardly vegetarian Dishes on their Platter. 


FOOD: Ordered Minestone Soup and Risotto.

Soup was okayish,expected it to be a little more tangy . It was sweet.

Vegetable Risotto: I really liked this dish. It had a layer of Spinach Flavoured Rice ,topped with Red Spicy Gravy Tossed Rice . Its got a Pinata Hollow in the middle that's filed with vegetables tossed in a Spicy Sauce. It's topped with cheese. This dish was a WIN-WIN for me. The only complaint being,Peas. Peas made the taste flat at times. But rest all, this dish was fab.

The Place is not too expensive. So you can try this place if you're a non-vegetarian. They've got loads of options.

Located just opposite to the karma fitness studio, near menoka cinemas in the heart of mudiali area, this place is a hidden gem for the food lovers.
Those who are lovers of steak and continental menu.. Must visit this place.
Recently the Steak Factory has launched a new number of dishes, which i had a oppurtunity to taste.
Coming to the items i tasted
Fire and ice - The best mocktail i ever tasted. It had a perfect sensation and taste of sweet and spice in it which made it unique.
A must try.!!
Chilly octopus - To the people who loves octopus. Please try this dish. I bet you will love the flavours and the dish.
Bacon st pork chop - My favourite among the all!!
And must try for all the pork lovers!
Bird nest pizza- A pizza served in a new concept. And the thick crust of the pizza with the cheesy layers in it make the pizza unique.
Old monk pizza - Pizza served with flaming old monk (rum). A totally new concept. Recommended for those who love to mix alcohol with food!!
Cheesy hazleback chicken - The grilled chicken served with veggies and sauce!
Fish aligot - Fish served with cheese topping!! Though i would love it.. If the layer of cheese would hve been a bit thin wd a bit of mayo flavours in it.
Over all the food were good!!
The place is budget friendly!!
I m hoping to visit the place again.

I have visited this place several times over the last couple of months and I really love it here. The decor is warm and the ambiance is cheerful. They have a great playlist of songs covering from the Poets of the Fall to The Cranberries.
The food and beverages available here are sumptuous, tasty and quite value for money. Along with the happy hours offer, it is rather light on the pocket.
The quantity and portion size of the dishes are standard.
I would recommend - Cocktail Sausages, Chicken Steak, Blackened Fish, Spaghetti Carbonara, California Fish Fillet Steak, Chocolate Monte Carlo, Shirley Temple, Orange Flake Mocktail.
The dishes- Blackened Fish, California Fish Fillet Steak and Spaghetti Carbonara are exceptional.
Though I found the Tenderloin Steak to be a bit stiff. 
Also the Factory Mixed Grill was a bit bland and under cooked.
The service is good and will be visiting again soon.

We were the first to order one Saturday morning. My wife always wanted to come here. The interiors are all Alvis and British. Small place but neat and tidy.

We ordered a mutton steak and a fish carnival. The food was server after 15min, I think thats ok when you arrive so early in the morning. The food was fresh and delicious. It reminded me of a small pub at Isle of Wight. The fish was tremendously tender and tasty. My wife liked the fish more, but I liked both of them.@ Price is reasonable too. One of the few restaurants which I would definitely visit soon. Rated 4.

The food was really amazing. The bacon wrapped in prawns is a must try...the steaks were actually above par with any City restaurant steaks. Amazing place but very small tables..has American cuisine which was worth it. Pricing was standard. Drinks were over priced but no excuse food was too good..loved it thanks..

A ton of people I know have recommended this place to me so I finally ended up trying it; turned out to be extremely overhyped. Given some of the newer options available in the city (Chili's, Wise Owl's steakhouse on the roof), I doubt I'll be back. How do you run a place called the "steak factory" and not understand "medium rare"? (sigh)

The owner of this eatery is brave.

He has attempted and broken several stereotypes in one go.

This is a leafy residential neighbourhood with no major traffic.And unlike Hindustan Park and Lake Road which are residential neighbourhoods as well this does not have a Gariahat or a Deshapriya park nearby.Brevity reason no. 1.

The name itself is brevity reason no. 2. In a city obsessed with Biryani and Indo Chinese opening a joint like this takes guts.Kudos

Brevity reason no. 3 is the premises itself.These guys unlike a Maison Delices have not done much to change the old residential flat that they have converted but cleverly added props like posters,wooden tables and chairs and significantly changed the atmosphere.

Lazy Sunday brunch started with fresh lime soda ( sweet ) and Chicken wings.The wings were the best I have had in a long time.Utterly delicious and fleshy.The drink was average.

Now I was looking forward to perhaps my first 5/5 experience in Kolkata and energetically asked for the tenderloin steak and my friend asked for the chicken steak.

Now if you are naming your outlet ' the Steak factory ',one expects the steak to be a signature dish,a kickass experience.Disappointed my friends.For one,I think it was buffalo and not beef,also unevenly cooked in parts and too tough.The sides were superb,especially the mashed potato and the sauce.The garlic breads were nice too.

I am a little wary of being unnecessarily harsh on places like this with character and having founded a cafe recently know how difficult it is for establishments to reach the desired quality.But that's what makes a place great eventually.

However,I'm coming back again very soon as this is a joint which has its heart in the right place.

Visited this place on 16th September, 2015. Heard few good things about this place the most important being this joint has brought something new to the table.
The place is a bit tough to find, as its located at an alleyway on southern avenue nearest landmark being Menoka cinema.
The Joint has an outlook of American diner though it's placed at the ground floor of a residential building.
We have ordered a chicken steak and mojito.

Pros:
1) Ambience is quite nice. It exudes a 70s NY diner vibe.
2) Food is served fresh and fast.
3) Food quality is good. It has very less spice and the presentation is quite nice.

Cons:
1) location is a bit tricky.
2) price is on the higher side.

This restaurant is located very near to my house and went there with a lot of expectations. The place is not very big but nicely decorated with wooden furniture and nice dim lights. We ordered bacon wrapped Chicken which was really good. Then we ordered pork ribs which was good in portion but the sauce was really bad. It was served with mashed potato and some veggies. I ordered a chicken steak which was ok. The service was good. But overall I was not satisfied with the food.

If your canines start crying all of a sudden, if suddenly you desperately want sink your teeth into flesh that doesn't mean you r phasing into a tiger..dude its meat craving of a bong.
It happened to me on a Saturday evening and zomato came to rescue.
I chose The Steak Factory for Sunday lunch..
A typical old kolkata cosy house ground floor simply turned into an eatery..nothing flashy nothing omg...
Ordered 3 dishes randomly (chiken ham something...mushroom chicken ham spinach something n tenderloin)
Waited like a hungry predator for 15 mins and bamm my meat was in front of me!
Delicious it was..savoured every bite with a foodgasmic moan. All the dishes catered to my taste and my meaty tummy was sated! To all my bong carnivoracious eaters out there cummon Steaks are waiting in the Factory!

P.S desserts not to be tried...when in meat place concentrate on meat!

One of the worst meals i have had in the longest time....

to start with the drink... 

Shirley Temple....... such a let down......

I had to order a fresh lime soda to get over the bad taste of Shirley temple

Starters.....

Bacon wrapped Prawn..... a huge rubbery piece of bacon and the tiniest piece of prawn..... 

Main course....

Ham steak...... i ordered for a steak and not a chunk of fat........ 4 of us ordered steak and 3 of us go lumps of fat and almost no meat.......... one of us had to send a dish back......... it is strange that a restaurant and a chef working in "Steak factory" does not even know what a cut should be like for a steak.....

Dessert.......

caramel custard....... extremely bitter...... you are meant to caramelize the sugar not burn it i guess..........

chocolate mousse...... lumpy, grainy..... 

Overall every dish i tasted was bad......

They serve one of the best porchops I have had in kolkata!! The place is small and cozy, the ambience and the decor is very homely and makes you feel comfortable instantly.The food...its one word "awesome"..specially the red meat steaks...do try their porkchops and beef tenderloin,which are the best.The sizzlers are worth a try too.So if you feel like having some yummy steaks in a nice and cozy place with your gang or your special one,this is the place to go!!

Oh please, excuse the hype and "awesome food". The owners probably take us to be fools who have never tasted steaks and salads abroad before. Ground floor of an old building converted into a restaurant. Situated in a bylane near Menoka cinema, Ravindra Sarovar. I had my car, what about people who don't? Very un-restaurant like. Very unprofessional. Not homely either. Not at all pleased with the seating arrangement. Somehow the walls are painted and the light dimmed. 2 posters do not make an ambience. The toilet is an absolutely rubbish facility. 
The food service was moderately quick. The service is quick because they hardly do anything with the food. Too much mayonnaise and worcestershire sauce made me wonder why am I paying so much for this menace.
We had.. Shrimp Cocktail - stay away, its boiled shrimps served with a dollop of mayo. Tastes like, well, boiled shrimp. And smells like one too. Chef Salad - meat chunks were pretty okay, the processed meat sausage was crappy and again loaded with mayo, surprising absence of lettuce form a salad. I love mayo, but why make a mayo pool out of a salad. Chicken Steak - good, cooked right, was served with fries, wish they had given mashed potatoes. Mixed something - again too much soya / worcestershire sauce. It seems they have chunks of everything ready. They simply add the sauce and serve up. Garlic bread - the ordinary spencer's garlic bread sliced up and toasted. They do not even know that garlic bread is never fully toasted like normal bread.
Very big disappointment. Anyways, i had already read about meagre food portions and was expecting it. We actually had sweets from Putiram to fulfil our tummies. The 1.5 is only for providing an opportunity to have steaks in Kolkata.
Will never visit again.

This is a restaurant which is quite close to the Rabindra Sarobar metro station so transportation is taken care of. The restaurant boasts of fabulous steaks which also has a lot of variety. The pork steak in particular was exquisite. All in all the food here is great and the ambience, which is also a factor in rating a restaurant, is also very nice and cosy. A good place to eat in. A day out with friends could comprise of a peep in here.

Just one word,amazing! I don't think even a man like Suhel Seth could find any flaw of this restaurant. Jokes apart,the food here is just superb and the ambience is too good. The ongoing offers here should drive even more people there. The current offers are displayed outside the restaurant. We had ordered a chicken steak and a factory mixed grill along with which we got a dessert of our own choice free. We had selected chocolate brownie as the dessert. The steak was delicious and so was the factory mixed grill and the quantity was sumptuous aswel. The steak was undoubtedly the best steak I have ever had. The grilled chicken was very yummy and the brownie was excellent. I had visited the New Alipore outlet before and had loved it there too. The staff were well behaved and the service they provided was good. A must visit for every meat lover.

This joint is a bit difficult to locate as it is situated far away from the main road in a lane unlike the New Alipore one. The ambience is good and the hospitality too. We ordered their ham steak, chicken steak and tetrazinni.They were amazing in taste. If you like steaks then this place is the ideal for satisfying your carnivorous appetite!

Question - What do you expect from a restaurant called Steak Factory?¬†

Steaks, right? A variety of steaks? What are steaks mainly? Beef steaks. So, I went there expecting a variety of Beef Steaks. On the menu there is only one beef steak i.e. "Tenderloin Steak". I ordered that with mashed potatoes. I asked if they have "Honey Mustard" by any chance. I was told "Yes". My friend ordered Pork Chops.¬†

The steak that I got looked something like a "deformed burnt hand". God knows who dressed THAT steak. I nearly got sick looking at it. I tried to have a bite and realised that the beef was stale. What was served as honey mustard was honey mixed with mustard. It took all my control not to laugh on the face of the gentleman serving me. My friends Pork chop was stale too. Lets not even go further on the presentation.

So here is what I think. The owner of this restaurant needs to do a quick reserach about various steaks and how they look. How does a Filet Mignon look, how does a New York Strip look, how does a tenderloin steak look, how does a T-Bone steak look, how does a Sirloin steak look, to start with. Then follow it up with a quick training on how each of them are dressed before it goes in the pan/oven. At this point, the promoter of this restaurant has NO CLUE about steaks. I won't blame the staff as the promoter needs to approve the menu and its presentation himself. If the promoter has no idea then how can I expect the staff to be trained? Which is why I didn't even bother complaining. There was simply no point.

The promoter also needs to have a crash course in a marketing term called "positioning". Steak Factory as a name simply demands specialization in Steaks.¬†

The Steak Factory clearly shows Kolkata's lack of knowledge in gourmet dining. The seller has no idea and neither do the buyers have any idea. So its all a convenient cycle of crap going.¬†

Judgment - If you know your meat and love your meat. Totally avoid this "wannabe" joint as far as meat is concerned. I don't know about the vegetarian stuff as I did not dare to go for any alternative. I wanted to pay my bill and run away as fast as possible.

The restaurant is situated a bit far from the main road but the quality of food is worth the wait and the walk. The place is a bit pricy too but the food makes up for it.
It's a must try place for every hangout groups.

Last Saturday I went to The Steak factory with my wife. I have heard many good reviews about this restaurant. So I was really eager to taste.. And frankly speaking I am very satisfied with the food. The person taking our order is very knowledgeable about the food. His behaviour is really polite and he understands our requirements first and then suggest. We took bacon wrapped prawn in starters and it was really a wow.. One must try this out..

Then we ordered for Factory special cheese beef steak and Mix Grill sizzler. Quantity wise it was enough and quality was awesome. I ate such tasty beef after a long time..

Only thing we want to taste Pork Ribs which was not there. But never mind, I want to come to this place again because I love the food so much.

Only cons I can see is, the place is little small so if more persons are ordering for sizzler etc sometimes it become suffocating. 

But overall food wise this place is very good and a big 5 star from my side..

Would have scored higher were they located at a more convenient place. Opening a restaurant is not always abt the food alone ... it also involves easy access to trabsportation for diners who don't have their own cars. I had to go in sesrch of a cab to return home when my wife and kids were midway through their desserts and by yhe time i returned, they were done paying the bill too!!!

Coming to the food, it was OK ... nothing extra ordinary. The sizzle of tje sizzlers died too soon after reaching the table ... would have enjoyed the sizzle for a bit longer. The portion size is also smaller as compared to other steak joints.

Overall an average experience which you can do without if u r fond of Peter Cat or Mocambo sizzlers.

The location is very complicated and impossible to find a cab if u don't have a car. The food is good if u don't want to travel to park street. But I found the sizzler portion smaller, the fish sizzler is good with a satisfactory sized bhetki fillet. Menu is a bit stereotyped if u visit steak joints often. The garlic bread was nice. We ordered for chicken steak sizzler, fish sizzler a portion of garlic bread and sausages. U can give it a skip if u enjoy mocambo sizzlers.

This was my second visit to Steak Factory, Southern Avenue in last 6 months or so. This time we were a group 10 colleagues for a Saturday lunch. While the food is perfectly in order and would get 8 on 10 it is the service that has to improve rapidly. We had a reservation and were made to sit on the 3rd room on extreme corner separated by a glass door along with a boisterous group of women. The waiter would disappear after taking the order without leaving a way to connect in between. You would have to get up and go to the main desk situated on another room looking for the waiter. Ditto after serving the food. In case you require any assistance, for example salt and pepper or some sauce, you had it! Either keep your fingers crossed and pray someone would walk in letting the food go cold, or do what you did before placing the order. That is start marching to the front desk and look for the waiter who took your order. It is just horrible in a word and owners must take immediate action to rectify this flaw. You just can't serve good food and ignore the rest of the faculties that keeps a restaurant in operation. When I wanted to know how does one get in touch in between, and if the have a calling bell or intercom etc, they kept quiet. Lastly, we wanted to change the table at the beginning and we were told that the Air conditioner in the middle room( which was empty then) was not working. To my shock, while leaving the restaurant and walking through the middle room to reach the main door, we found that room filled with guests with the AC on!! You should not have lied to us to avoid our request. It's not so pleasant experience end of the day.

A residential building being turned into a restaurant, very common is south kolkata these days.. Its a good concept, but restaurants need to be a little for careful. The restroom.. Is cover by a curtain, a bit disturbing for the ladies..
The restaurant has very limited seating capacity, and they make the most of it by serving food at lightning speed.. The food is decent..

Pretty poor with respect to everything. Neither is the location on the main Southern Avenue road nor does the decor inside the place make it at all noteworthy.
We ordered Cajun Fish Fry,Chicken Sizzler & Blackened Fish.The Blackened Fish was horrible and extremely bland with noodles being served in tomato sauce instead of the pasta as promised.Chicken Sizzler was undercooked and the amount served wasn't impressive either.The Cajun Fish was probably the sole saving grace.
The service, too left a lot to be desired.
After hearing so much √†bout it,it failed to live up to its reputation immensely and I shall not recommend it to anyone.

Located in the sleepy neighbourhood of southern avenue, steak factory is the second outlet of the restaurant in the city.

It is a small place with 10-12 tables approx. The restaurant is dinly lit but gives a very western feel with the posters and wooden furniture. It does look like a steak house.

I ordered for a veg charcoal steak and my boss went for the ham steak. He loved the food and devoured it .
I too liked my steak though I felt the Patty could have been seasoned well.
We got a dessert free on our order and went for a caramel custard which was tasty though I feel it had too much of vanilla giving it a little bitter after taste.

Staff was courteous and we paid 600for the meal.

Overall a nice place!

Being a bit far away from my home, I did not get much chance before to visit this outlet. I had approached this from Menoka Cinema, took the left beside it, and kept walking straight for 5 minutes after which took a left turn (GPS came to my aid).

The first thing which caught my attention was the decor and ambiance. The place was pretty deserted with hardly 2 tables being occupied. I had ordered for a Factory Special Cheese Steak (Beef) and a Lamb Ragout for parcel which was ready and hence I did not get much chance to spend time inside.

Coming to the food, the Cheese Steak was prepared well. It consisted of 2 large portions of meat with a small and thing coating of cheese over it. The accompanying sauce was nice. However, I found the meat to be slightly overdone and hence I had to use my hands instead of fork and knife.¬†I was anyways eating it at the comfort of my home, hence it did not embarrass me much (:-P). The cheese was slightly salty as well but overall the steak was nicely done.

Coming to the Ragout, I could not understand what the dish was all about. The meat was not flavored at all and lacked even the salt. The gravy seemed light and diluted as if someone had poured water over it. The meat was soft but it could have been softer. The entire thing tasted more like a Chinese affair rather than a Continental One. Perhaps opting for the Lamb Roast would have been a better idea.

The packing of the food was decent and I was not charged for the containers. However, they did add the Service Tax along with the VAT. Overall I felt the quality of the food has much scope for improvement. The behavior of the staff was cordial and nice. Looking forward to visit this place again.

An absolute travesty to the sizable legacy of tenderloin steaks. Their medium-well felt and tasted like rubber, making the experience very very very tedious. The ambience along with the meatballs starter was nice, however, the tenderloin is not something id reccomend. All in all a mediocre dining experience at best.

Went last night with my school friend. Decor and music attracted my attention. Staffs were good and cordial.
We ordered tenderloin steak,ham steak,pasta with seafood. And we got one free dessert,we opted for Monte Carlo.
Tenderloin steak was good,I loved it,but may be a bit soft and juicier would be better.
Ham steak was superb. And,for my love to seafood,pasta with seafood was my choice, and they made me to relish the food even to the last bite. I added more oregano,and the flavor and taste was too good.
Monte Carlo amazed me,I ate more than half portion. :P cake with ice cream &cookies - a lovely dessert to dig in.
Loved the decor and ambience as well as the food. :)

I have been to this outlet thrice and this place always lives up to my expectations. Do try the bacon wrapped prawns,  I found it delicious. Other than that their steaks are brilliant and  we tried the spaghetti bologniese and chicken tetrazini which was equally good. :-) oh yeah and we got a complimentary desert too so overall it was a great experience. :-D

To satiate my meat cravings we decided to visit Steak Factory last Saturday. And when we came out after that sumptuous meal we realized that it was one great decision to choose this place for our lunch. A foodie can ask for nothing else when courteous staff, warm ambiance and great food everything comes together at one single place. It is surely one hidden gem to many who do not frequent these places that much. 

LOCATION - - - - - ¬†The place is located at Southern Avenue quite close to Mudiali Club and Menoka Cinema, since it is very close to Menoka Cinema that direction worked good for me. But still I would say it might just be a bit tricky to reach the spot and hence you may use google maps to locate this place correctly.  

AMBIANCE - - - - - ¬†If you are very familiar with South Kolkata residential buildings then you would find this structure pretty familiar and homely. The ground floor of a house has been converted to this restaurant. But I would say the interiors have been done very well with Hollywood movie posters and Hollywood actors of bygone era adorning most of the walls, the place has got some Wild West feel to it with the cowboy hat placed on a shelf at the billing counter. The red brick wall finish of the interior has got an extremely good finish and just sets the mood right. The solid wood tables and sitting arrangements are perfect and quite comfortable. The place is not so big and it might be an issue if a large group plans to visit this place, but then they can surely make arrangements to accommodate them in the best possible way. The place is definitely bigger than their New Alipore branch and that is the biggest plus I guess. Also they play lovely English numbers starting from John Denver to Coldplay, which goes so well with the ambiance and sets the perfect mood for the meal.  

FOOD - - - - - ¬†We decided to go only for steaks, but then we ended up ordering for Barbeque Pork Ribs and Factory Special Beef Cheese Steak. Let us discuss a bit about these dishes now:

(a) FACTORY SPECIAL BEEF CHEESE STEAK ‚Äì The plate had saut√©ed veggies like carrot, beans, cauliflower, bits of corn which were well prepared, along with these there were lovely onion rings which were lightly tossed with some herbs. Along with these, there was a small bowl of red wine sauce and some mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes could have been much better and they need to work on this, the proportion of cream and milk were not right in there, also quality of potatoes used can be better as it didn‚Äôt smell that good. Now comes the best and the most important part of this dish, the beef steak itself which was done Medium Rare. It was really well marinated with spice rub and nicely grilled, it had a coating of cheese on top of it which indicates the grilled steak was later baked with this cheese. As a result the overall steak was firm but it was quite juicy in the centre with soft fibers, not at all chewy; it was one of the best beef steaks I had in the city. The combination of the steak and the cheese atop it made it even more amazing. You can surely try this out!   

(b)  BARBEQUE PORK RIBS - It was kind of a melt-in-your-mouth dish. These dishes are best done if you are preparing it with baby back or regular pork ribs. The ribs were tender, moist and just slided off of the bone. We just loved them, had a bit too much fat according to me, but then that was acceptable since the overall dish was amazing! It was kinda smoky and had the cooked-on-the-grill flavor. It was very well marinated with the spice rub and prepared to perfection. The barbeque sauce all over the dish made it absolutely lip smacking. But one thing I didn‚Äôt like, we were served with French Fries and were never asked if we would like to have Mashed Potatoes instead! The dish also had saut√©ed veggies in it like carrot, beans, cauliflower and bits of corn. Again you can surely go for this dish, recommended!

SERVICE - - - - - ¬†The person looking after our table was extremely polite, patient and helpful, he was also well aware of the dishes and the ingredients. The service was prompt and the billing process was speedy. Cards are accepted, no issues with that. 

OVERALL - - - - - ¬†Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.7/5
Food quality: 4.3/5
Food presentation: 4.4/5
Value for money: 3.9/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4/5

As said earlier, the quality of food is a big plus point here. Only one thing ‚Äì all the taxes charged make the dining experience a bit expensive and that is aided by the fact that the quantity of food served is not on the higher side, so you may tend to order more. But the steaks really will make you come back to this place and I‚Äôll be back pretty soon to try out more from their menu which seems pretty inviting ad exciting to me! A big thumbs up from my side.

Cheers!

Few restaurants offer such value for money. I went there three weeks ago with my wife and daughter and have decided to go there once a month.Since I live in the vicinity, I had no problem in locating the place but people coming from Central or North Calcutta could go around in circles trying to find it! But believe me---it would be well worth the effort!

They have special offers on week days such as one free dessert for every two main courses or one free main course if you order 3 main courses but I went on a week end and had to pay for everything! 

We ordered a lamb ragout, a californian fish fillet steak and a chicken steak. All the dishes were mouth-watering. The ragout containing large chunks of lamb with veggies in a red wine sauce was simply awesome. The portions were large so that we were in no position to order desserts. Nevertheless, we decided to share brownies with ice cream. It was absolutely delicious.

A word of caution: if you go on a week-end, go either early or a little late. If you go during peak hours, you are unlikely to get a seat as the place is really small.

Been there three months ago. Great food, believe me, I just love the place. It's a non-veg paradise, especially what I got and what I was charged. The service boys need to be a little more professional.
But I would like to add a little more. If you are veg don't go there even though they have veg items in their menu. I visited them a month back with my family and a couple of friends who were veg and had a such a bad experience that I had to leave that place and dine at a Chinese joint.

Too much of goodness in a single plate n then ordering the same dish can happen here only. I had mutton n pork both but mutton was better. Actually in the pork rib dish I could find the fat part of pork more than the flesh part so next time I would mention not to gimme the fat part of it.
Second point to mention is that in spite of good ambience n grt this place renains unnoticed n underrated because of the space. It would have been a greater place for bday treat or an anniversary treat if it was more spacious. But again they already have 2 outlets n hope the 3rd one would be like that :)

Reviews should be judged in conjunction of time place and definitely circumstantial poristhiti.... small tiny place...u land and have to wait... but a wait worth every penny... with all their constraints... they have turned to be a comfort food zone... steaks awesome... tried all their beef specials...one word of caution....the meat transcends its character from medium rare to well done...which is yuck n rubbery....medium rare steaks are soothing as well as broths and breads.... we tried rissotos.. helpful servings but we concentrated on the meat

Amazing pork ribs ! I keep on going to this place for just this one item. Those juicy delicious tender pork ribs !! Yum! 
The outlet is located in the lane alongside priya cinemas, on the left. The seating capacity is pretty limited, the decor ain't anything applaudable. But they have got the pitch right with the food! 
Pros:
1. Really tasty steaks !
2. The other items on the menu are also pretty tasty
3. Peaceful location with enough parking place.
4. Good place to bring your friends/ family/ office guys , anyone
5. Supposedly they have WiFi. Personally I have felt the speed has become one tenth of what it used to be.
Cons:
1. Where's the booze! 
Must try items:
Those yum tender pork ribs!

Visited The Steak Factory joint at Southern Avenue for the first time with much anticipation and a burning belly. Had ordered bacon wrapped prawns, Ham and Tenderloin steak along with aerated drinks. However apart from the bacon wrapped prawns, the steaks were pretty ordinary. The meat was not tender and juicy as it should be for steaks. Ambience was ok but the room where we were seated didn't have the AC working; so it was a sweaty affair. The aerated drinks came( normal Thumbs Up) almost after we finished the meal. The service was not efficient I would say. There were lapses and oversight in giving proper no of plates and cutlery.

Came here with a couple of friends for an unplanned dinner. And I was blown away. I have always liked sizzlers and steaks and what not. Never knew of this place and it's talent of making such fabulous dishes. I had their seafood sizzler as I have a soft spot for seafood. It was in one word simply amazing. My friends had the ham steak and their mixed grill.  All of them were cooked to perfection. My taste buds are tingling and I can't wait to come back here again

An amazing birthday treat with amazing people at Steak Factory, Southern Avenue. The starters were Bacon-wrapped Prawns (with an amazing spiced honey dip), Spicy Chilli Pork and Cajun Fish Fry with Tartar Sauce. The pork was not really happening but the others were great!

The main courses were really good. The fish preparations were a little let down though, because it was written Bhetki but we were served something else, most probably Basa. But all the steaks were really really tasty. Here are the dishes in the order that I loved them:

1. Factory Special Cheese Steak (Beef)
2. Mutton Steak
3. Pot Roasted Mutton
4. Chicken SteakT
5. Lamb Ragout
6. California Fish Fillet Steak
7. Baked Chicken ala Neapolitan
8. Factory Grilled Fish

But the disappointment of the fish was not expected in Kolkata.

I have been here twice and both the times my experience was amazing. The staff here is very hospitable and the ambience is musical. The steaks here are one of the best in kolkata. A must have dish here is the factory special cheese steak(beef,lamb,pork).all are good. Bacon wrapped prawns is a very good starter here. Other than that, pot roasted lamb is a very light and savoury dish and california fish fillet is also damn good. Normal lamb steak is also very nice and prosciutto stuffed chicken is also a speciality here. Cajun fish fry is also a very good starter here.A must go to steak place in kolkata. Overall a great experience.

Like most restaurants in the Southern Avenue and Rabindra Sarovar region, this one too's a bit tricky to find. So expert advice : keep your google maps handy.¬†Once located however, The Steak Factory will make sure it satisfies your meat cravings.
¬†

The place is small and partitioned into 3 compartments, each capable of catering to 10-12 hungry souls. The walls are draped in movie posters and the music is quite eclectic ranging from Bon Jovi to Pink Floyd. ¬†

Not really important to the review, but the place where I was seated had a small poster of Before Sunrise next to it. Now Linklater is one of my favorite directors and the Before series is easily the most underrated post modern romantic masterpiece there is. So, here's a fair warning that my review may be biased.¬†

We first ordered a tenderloin steak. The steak was done medium, and pretty perfectly cooked. They accompanied it with grilled veggies, mashed potato and a mushroom soup. The people who advocate beef ban should really try a good steak once to see what they have been missing all these years. Jokes apart, the dish is quite heavy quantity wise and while I was already feeling stuffed after having one full steak, we decided to try out the Lamb Ragout. This one's a rather unique dish with large chunks of lamb, button mushrooms and bell peppers cooked in a sauce of red wine. The only complain about it is that they left bits of fat with the meat. Now, I know many prefer their meat this way. But it proved to be kind of a spoiler for me in what was otherwise quite the flawless dish.¬†¬†
Virgin Mojito was like what it should be. Cool and refreshing.¬†¬†¬†

A very satisfying factory this.

Wanted to try dinner for the weekend at Southern avenue outlet but was really put off by the indifferent attitude of the staff. Perhaps because it was the end of the day and they thought enough bussiness has been done or they thought they have already attained a good name so could afford to disregard a few customers

This one is a bit bigger than the one in New Alipore and ample place to park the car on the side roads. Service was really good and so were the steaks. Tenderloin Steak is what we ordered. It came with smashed potatoes, light onoins fries and saute vegetables. The steak was really soft. Along with garlic bread its a great combination. Would like to try the pork ribs next time. Highly recommended..

On our first visit to the Steak Factory, I was very impressed by the ambience and the food. We had Caesar salad, tenderloin steak, and garlic bread. The salad was slightly salty, but the Steak, medium done, was excellent. It was juicy and the portion was just right for one person. I also liked the retro look and feel of the restaurant. One minor glitch: one of the condiments was musty and should not have been placed on the table.

Finding the place is not that hard! Food was good specially the starter, would visit again for the starter specially for the bacon! Unfortunately the steaks didn't ring the bell, ordered ham steak which was not at all fresh, did officially mention this to restaurant staff which was in vain. So visiting again- No way! Will miss the bacon though!

Very small, quaint place and happy hour (buy 2 main course get 1 dessert free) really does make it worth the while. Besides Irish House and Smoke House Deli, The Steak Factory serves well made steaks. A particular favourite is the pork sizzler. The lamb ragout was divine as well. I can't vouch for the beef steak, I always find the meat too tough, however the other main courses are very well made. Personally the lamb dishes had better flavour than the pork ones. Avoid the mixed grill, it has too many sausages in it.
But don't go with a huge group of friends at lunch time. Might have to wait a long while.

After visiting this place for a lunch,my friend's yet to recover from the shock...so here i am, penning a review.....sadly a score below 1 can't be given.......but would have gladly given this place a rating in minus....The ambience is good enough (after all they play bob dylan and dire straits), if not a bit cramped.. the service is pathetic with all waiters looking like clueless schoolboys....everything needs to be said and asked at least twice to get the attention of them...coming to food, we ordered bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp cocktail and tenderloin steak ....Bacon was too chewy and on the fatty side.......the salad, well if that can be called a salad (i thought of it as a desert first) was a dollop of mayonnaise with boiled prawns........ the tenderloin was anything but tender....i thought they would give me a pick-axe to get a dent on that......overall it was a horrific experience and i don't want to repeat it

This places deserves a full score. Probably you'll miss the lane where it is located, but once you see the signs outside there is no ways your gonna miss it. The moment you enter the eatery, you have a feeling, a feeling like some good old cosy restaurant where you can bring your loved once... one of the special thing you'll find here is the menu not what's on it but the menu it self, should go and check it out ,mystery remains... the service is one of the best, the guy who served us always had a smile on his face and was very much helpful... next was food, seriously loved it, I had tenderloin steak which was one of the best in the city, I used to work in Taj Bengal and they don't serve such an awesome steak... dessert made me blow away... it's such a place where I found that even if I close my eyes and select any of the dishes I still won't go wrong... will definitely return...

I have been to steak factory about three times, (with last visit a few months back), on Dashami, Christmas and a random day. From my experience,  the best day to turn up at steak factory is ALWAYS a random day. On special days, they mostly run out of food ( pork mainly), take eternity to get it (45 minutes), and even mismanage the order (they replaced the chicken chelo for my dad on their own to a mutton chelo, suo moto, which my dad doesn't even eat). 

But on that random day, the factory mixed grill is delicious, the starters steal the deal,  the fish and chips become your favourite and even the desserts satiate you. To add to it, the chef walks up to you at times and the people at the counter (young and cordial, not sure if they are the owners) personally attend to you.

And now there's the tenderloin steak ( thank god for that ! It is very difficult to imagine a steak factory without beef). 

Basically, a place like this calls for some serious patience from its food loving patrons. Yes, the service cracks up under pressure and not all items are top notch ( like ham steak), but the place has a lot of serious potential ( the sauces are quite on the brilliant side for starters and have been well thought through. The prepping and marination of some meat items are also very nuanced and shows a lot of skill). 

So, you could reject and downgrade this place and never visit (if your first experience isnt always first class) , or like me visit it for a second, third and fourth shot ( every once in a while) with the hope that it has pulled up its socks and has begun to give consistently awesome food now.

I came here after hearing good reviews from my friends, it was on a sunday and even though we got seats on reaching, their was just one waiter to take orders from everyone and the restaurant was almost full. So the orders were taken a bit late and service was slow but the food was good, very less in quantity though. We had ordered a chicken steak which was ok, Not THAT GREAT! But the salad and the starters were good. MY sister had ordered the virgin Mojito and it was really good but when we wanted to order another one the waiter informed us that it was finished and they didn't have any of the ingridients left to make another one. Please take a note and keep your pantry full so that you don't run out of food on a weekend!

It is actually a task to decide on which restaurant to dine out at on a holiday since most of the good ones have a long queue outside their entry. Hubby actually drove the entire stretch from north to south Kolkata with Zomato opened up on my phone. What ridiculous options we get online when the need arises! Ever tried googling "Newly opened restaurants in Kolkata"? Anyways, we got fed up of looking for new options and decided to head straight to Steak Factory. We skipped the New Alipore one since we were afraid of the queue it might have. We had never gone to the new outlet near Menoka Cinema before. And luckily, we got a table as soon as we stepped in. The menu card was unique- a wooden frame with all the options printed on it. We ordered beef steak for my hubby and pork chops for myself. Though I'm not at all into rock, the playlist definitely made hubby happy- it had everything from Pink Floyd to Bryan Adams and hard rock songs. The food, as usual, was great! We liked the ambiance of the new outlet too. We finished off our dinner with caramel carousel. Overall a very sumptuous dinner. The drive back home became happier as it started drizzling!¬†--¬†Rock On!

I went to The Steak Factory for Second time and this time with my friends for dinner, late around 10 PM. It is a tiny first floor room turned into a restaurant. The tables are placed too close together and the music gets too loud. Nice interiors ,well managed even if its a small place but the food is good. 

We ordered  a Tenderloin steak with boiled vegetables, some mashed potato and sauce, Pork chop which was full of fat but so so so delicious, Penne & Spaghetti : Carbonara & Tetrazzini which was heavenly.. We ordered both ( Carbonara & Tetrazzini) as Penne but from kitchen it comes out one Penne & another Spaghetti. One of my friend also faced this incident when she visited last time. So at that late night they offered for a change,but we denied that. Hope the kitchen guys listen properly during working hours..

The restaurant is small and the seats are congested but the prompt service and nice ambience makes up for it. I'd go back there again & love to have their steak and chops and am sure would love the food and enjoy a leisurely meal..Loved it! :)

I would have given it a 3.5 but for the waiter putting on airs about how a virgin mary should taste! It had too much Tabasco and was hot and the waiter looked down at me disdainfully and started lecturing me about what it should taste like. This sort of Bengali parochialism gets me down in my own city. Okay, to start at the beginning, my colleagues are giving me a hard time at work and my husband wanted to give me a treat to get my spirits up. the children were at school and the two of us decided on this place as it was conveniently located. the sky was dark as we approached Southern Avenue and it broke into a downpour the moment we entered the small cloistered little place. It is a tiny first floor room turned into a restaurant. The tables are placed too close together and the music gets too loud. But the food is good. We had a chef's special soup with some bread which was nondescript but was hot and it was raining outside and the trees looked so happy, so it was okay. Then we had a Cesar salad and tenderloin steak well done and another chicken steak with boiled vegetables, some mashed potato and gravy. the garlic bread we ordered was mushy and had to be redone when it became crisp but dry. SO something is the matter with the kitchen! I ended with chocolate icecream with caramel and cherries and it was quite good. Plus, they did not bill the icecream as it was "Happy Hour". ¬†Yaay. Overall, a good experience and the food was really filling and made me sleepy. I'd go back there with the kids who love their steak and chops and am sure would love the food except it is too cramped to really enjoy a leisurely meal and that nasty waiter really need to be taught some manners.

Thank God for Zomato that we were pleased to find this place at a stones throw distance from our house. 
As you enter the cosiness of the room makes you feel at home. The decor keeping in mind the western tag is very 'hep' but with photographs on the wall and old country music gives you the feel of a modernised western tavern.
We went early so they attended to us pretty soon. But with the service comes how soon one serves the ordered dish. And it took some half an hour to serve our dishes.
Food was very good. We ordered a Chicken with Rosemary and Barbequed Pork Ribs. The quantity was very filling and the taste was delicious. Especially the Rosemary Chicken. 

Overall experience was very good. Hence this rating.

I went to The Steak Factory with my friends for lunch during the happy hours. So we could avail the buy three, get one free deal on main course. We ordered Quesadillas, Fish and Chips, Shirley Temple, Lamb Ragout, Pasta Putanesca, Grilled chicken and Chocolate Monte Carlo. The quesadillas were crispy and well stuffed, Pasta Putanesca was served in huge quantity. Chocolate Monte Carlo is an absolute delight, it has layers of brownie and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate chips, cherry and chocolate sauce. The restaurant is small and the seats are congested but the prompt service and nice ambience makes up for it.

We ordered almost everything in here,and loved the food. The starters were really nice,fish and chips followed by a vegetarian dish.
Then came the Shirley temple along with Lamb Ragout, Penne Alio Oil, Charcoal Chicken steak and Crab. The Chicken steak was juicy and was cooked to perfection. The lamb,however was a bit rough,and the crab was not upto the expectations.
However we concluded with a Brownie ice cream. The food was really sumptuous. Loved it! :)

I am rather so very disappointed with the kind of experience we had at this place.Me with two of my close buddies reached there on sunday morning (2/8/2015) as we were soo much wanted to have bacon strips.

We got the menu and atonce ordered the ham burger which had bacon strips as an add on .The description of the dish clealry mentiones the add on which was going to be the part of it.The addons were :
A. Bacon strips
B.mayonise with french fries 

We ordered and waited and waited and waited.It took them almost an hour to make the burgers .

Finally when we got thhe dish ,we were utterly shocked to see that neither there were bacon strips and mayonise provided. 

We asked the waiter about such discrepancy and he after almost tryinf to utter the truth stated that : 

A.the bacon strips have been mincely chopped with the patty in thr burger. WHY WIll ANYONE with a sane mind do that . why will you add the bacin in the patty and mincely chop it. 
B.we were served thr dish with tomato sauce and not mayonise and after due notice they got us a single little bowl of mayonise .


I am sooo pissed of with place. Firsy you dont serve what you preach. Secondly the quality of food is disgusting ....the patty was oggling with oil. 

I would request the management to look at this issue and come back to me with a solution

I am very fond of steaks.. Wanted to try some really good steaks. So as suggested by my friends, visited this place. Nice interiors ,well managed even if its a small place. Now coming to the food, ordered ham steak, pork sizzler, sphagetti and factory special factory mixed grill.. Food is okayish, not out of the world type taste.. Expected much more, but nevertheless, a worth try for new comers.

Calcutta had been waiting a long time for steakhouses like this. This one is more conveniently located than its predecessor, near the Rabindra Sarobar lake. As soon as I entered the place, I was struck by its unique ambience. Framed on the walls were the posters of my favourite films and musicians. (Pulp Fiction, Casablanca, Forrest Gump, Dylan, Lenon etc.) Then we were led to room in the back which is mostly used when the place is full. This one had even more interesting props. Getting to the menu, they have everything a steak lover can wish for, from an assortment of salads, to sizzlers, steaks, fish, pasta, pizzas and an interesting list of mocktails to choose from. We ordered California fish fillet steak, factory mixed grill, tenderloin steak and spaghetti Bolognese. For drinks, we ordered Virgin Mojito, lime and bitters, orange flake mocktail and virgin pinacolada. The food here is something I can vouch for, and I am not lying when I say that it can even mend a broken heart.  A must visit if one is in the city. The staff there are very polite and dedicated. The good music which plays in the background adds to the customer‚Äôs delight. And yes they also have free wifi.

We felt difficulties to find the location. We went there for dinner with friends. Ambience was good space was small. We have taken sizzlers,steaks,rissotto here.As the name shows steaks , sizzlers were good. But the rissotto could have been better. I would suggest that the quantity a bit less but overall we were satisfies.

Now coming to the food, had ordered irish broth, chicken factory mix, ham steak, pork sizzler and spaghetti bolognese. Overall all of the items were okay-ish. Nothing seemed to impress me to the core. 
Place has got a nice touch, with courteous staff and also free wifi!

Went to steak factory the southern avenue outlet last evening for dinner with family. Ordered beef steak , factory mixed grill and baked chicken ala napolitano. The beef steak was just perfectly done and the sauce was heavenly. The chicken napolitano was just pure magic to the taste buds so was the factory mixed grill. Wrapped the dinner with the authentic caramel custard. Savoured every bit of the meal. The meal was made all the more scrumptious with the classic hollywood decor taking me back to the steak houses i have been to abroad. Fantastic and warm service. It's a must visit.

Special recommendations for the Meat Balls, Lasagna and spaghetti. I will have steaks from this place any day of the week and twice on a weekend, No Questions Asked.

Absolute Disappointment!!
Went there after reading a lot of reviews about the place but ended up being really disappointed.
The place looked good and the ambiance was nice; but the service was slow, sloppy and lacked conviction.
About the food, Ordered Bacon wrapped prawn, Shrimp cocktail, Pork Tenderloin and Monte Carlo.¬†The bacon wrapped prawn was¬†OK¬†but a little too¬†fatty. The shrimp cocktail looked more like a dessert with a huge dollop of spicy mayo on top which completely over powered the rest of the components. The Tenderloin was complete opposite of tender. It was dry and chewy and really hard to swallow. Even the mash potato didn't taste as good.
The Monte Carlo was good and it explains why they have a wall decor "EAT DESSERTS FIRST".
Overall, I would say I was hugely disappointed with the food and the overall experience.

Been there for a family dinner. This place is awesome situated in a lane just off Southern avenue.
PROS:
1> Food quality & quantity is very good
2> Value for money. We ordered 2mixed grill sizzler, 1 sea food sizzler, 1 full chicken steak & 2? Items for starter. It costs around 2100bucks. This is awesome if we consider the price with other restaurants in this category & quality of food.
3> Ambiance is pretty good. We went in a rainy night & it feels like we are sitting in some old London restaurant where stewards speak bengali :)

Cons:
1> Service need to improve. We waited for around 10 minutes for water.
2> This is only restaurant, no bar present. We are desperately missing some good scotch with the dinner. Actually continental dinner goes well with some good whisky. 

Bar is missing thay's why I can't rate it 5. But if you go by food quality then it's 5+

Went there yesterday evening to have those famed Steaks!!Located in a lane opposite the Rabindra sarobar lake the restaurant is a bit small. However, the place has got a feel good factor to it and its neat and tidy. We had ordered Chicken Steak and Chicken Sizzler..the Steak was decent enough but surprisingly the Sizzler tasted way better and was quite delicious..overall a decent place with good food quality and comfortable seating arrangements..However, on the space aspect the restaurant really needs to improve and it does require an expansion.

I went to this place for a quick dinner today and to soothe my tongue for it was craving meat for a long time now. The ambience and decor was good, music was over too loud ; though some good numbers were being played. We ordered chicken steak, chelow kebab, and factory mixed grill. The food quality is average only I would say. Of Deserts caramel custard was as usual and the chocolate brownie was too sweet. An average food joint as per my opinion and won't recommend as one of the must go joints. Sorry.

Today was my fourth visit to this restaurant. It is getting better every time. They stick to authentic recipes-no short cuts are employed, which is one of the great things about this place. I have never tasted Pork ribs, Lamb steak etc like the ones I had here. The ambience, the service, the decor are all great. The atmosphere is very relaxing. Fortunately I live in the same area, so I can enjoy their food anytime!

I visited this place after a long time and the taste did not change one bit and is as delicious and amazing since the last time. My favourite starter, bacon wrapped prawns was heaven. We ordered chicken ala kiev, the chicken was a bit stringy and not as soft but the flavour was good. After that we ordered tenderloin steak and grilled seafood sizzler. The sizzler was near perfection. It had squid, prawn and fish pieces. Maybe a bit of crab meat would have reached perfection, anyhow not complaining. Beef was also cooked well and wasn't tough. Also since we had gone during Happy Hours: 12-6(i think) we got a choice of free dessert or another main. Since we were already too full, we opted for a dessert. We took a caramel pudding, nothing exceptional, but it was free. :p I have already recommended it to my friends and is definitely worth visiting again.

It is exceedingly hard to find great steak joints in Calcutta, the steak factory at alipore is an exception and when another outlet came up at southern avenue, I had to pay a visit. So last sunday I planned for a late lunch with my girlfriends and oh my, the place had to offer even more than I thought. This one's a comfy and feel-at-home sort of place that exudes the American diner charm, we generally yearn watching the Hollywood flicks. The place is scrupulously designed by humble wooden benches, corrugated red walls and large white windows. On every wall you would find posters of your favourite artist, records and movies. The room where we sat took my breath away, it had party lights spread all over, hanging from the wires were tiny posters of Elvis,Doors, Pulp fiction, Breakfast at Tiffany's etc. We ordered the Tenderloin Steak (medium rare), penne alio oli and for coolers, lime & bitters and virgin mojito. The steak was juicy and tender, seasoning was mild but the mushroom based jus or gravy was a clear winner though a little more french fries was what I needed. The pasta had the perfect tang and bite, it was licked clean. Lime & bitters was quite different just like its name. For desserts we ordered the good old chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Every morsel of it was filled with gooey goodness. And with the jazz, rock n roll and classic pop playing you are gonna leave with a happy stomach.
I guess, I'm gonna be back soon and I really hope they get the jukebox this time.

Such an amazing experience of the mouth watering food here. The food is one of a kind. For the starters, special mention should made of the bacon wrapped prawn. The bacon just melts in ur mouth and will blow you off.The steaks, factory mixed grill, risotto all are delicacies one should must have. The pork ribs, lamb chops are well cooked and tender.The desserts are a cool way to finish off the stupendous meal. Plus they play mostly potf songs (my favourite) making it just perfect.

The location of this outlet was a bit confusing when i first visited it..but after that first visit its no more an issue.

This particular outlet is not quite spacious but the ambiance is good.. They have some nice tracks playing.

Coming to the food .. What attracts me is their idea of serving a couple of people or a group. They have an offer of giving a dessert free with two main course.
For a group of 4 you can order 3 main dishes to get the 4th free..

Quality and spread is very nice. As the name suggests they serve brilliant steaks...but lamb lasagne,pot roasted mutton, sizzlers are also worth a try.
Well you have a lot of options to select from their long menu card.

A must try !

I was eyeing this place for long and finally got a chance to get there on occasion of my cousin's birthday treat. The place is hard to find as it is located in an alley beside Menoka cinema hall.  We literally struggled to find it, so later took the help of the GPS to locate it down. 

The place is small. But the ambiance is great with minimalistic d√©cor, apt lighting and music. The waiters were very cordial and guided us in our menu selection. We ordered Prawn Popcorn and Crispy Fried Calamari in starters and three variant of steaks for the main course: Mutton Steak, Tenderloin Steak and Barbeque Pork Ribs.

The Prawn Popcorn was good. But didn't like the Fried Calamari much with a plain Mayo dip. The Mutton Steak was nothing much to talk about. The sauce was plain and the veggies lacks the crunchiness. However the Tenderloin Steak was the show stealer! It was very soft, succulent and tasty. I really liked this. The Barbecue Pork Ribs which my cousin bro ordered was also good. Though it contains too much fat to my liking, I really liked the sauce accompanied with it. 

My first outing in this outlet was not much to talk about but I will definitely go there again for the Tenderloin Steak and the great ambiance.

Located it with the help of gps. The place is quite small in size . Went their with high expectation but was disappointed. We ordered fried calamari in starters which was quite plain with no seasoning of any sort and the dip was a plain mayonnaise (would have enjoyed it if the dip was more tasty rather than a plain mayo). We were feeling quite monotonous. In main course we ordered chicken steak which was ok nothing great with small amount of vegetables also served with French fries. Another chicken dish which we ordered was baked ala chicken neapolitan was served in a bed of mashed potato ,bell peppers ,mushrooms and the chicken breast lying on top which was baked in raw egg. First thing which I noticed was that the dish in which rhe food was served was not a clean one secondly the chicken was not cooked through as it was really tough to chew and the inside was red in colour in bits which really turned me off and I did not eat it thought the taste of the sauce was good. The dishes also was not that attractive to look. The staffs were very polite and well behaved and good music were being played. The total bill amount was 1200 approx.

This was the second time that i dropped in at The Steak Factory. The first time I had a mixed experience so dropped in the second time to see whether this place is really as good as the reviews tell us. Ordered a chicken steak and the sauce it came with was bland. The mash was very average and so were the accompanying veggies. Soggy and dead. The crunchiness which I like in my vegetables was missing. My friend ordered for a chicken salad which was just okay. I was really disappointed this time around as well, may be it was a bad day or my bad selection of food, but I really wish that the next time I drop in, I won't be disappointed like always.

Good food. Great music. Cozy ambiance. The place is hard to find, where google failed to help us, and one needs to be an expert in navigating through the narrow lanes of South Kolkata to find them. My friend and I went for a late lunch and ordered two drinks (the Shirley Temple and the Jungle Juice) which were very refreshing. Along with that, we ordered the beef steak and tetrezzini, along with a side of garlic bread. The tetrezzini, though good, was a little too liquidy once the top layer of cheese had been consumed. The beef steak however was great, and so were the sides.

My friend and I are huge foodies and we use zomato to check out places in the city. We saw this place and their menu was impressive so we thought, why not? When we reached there it had a nice ambience and could tell that when the place was set up it was fine with close attention to detail. Even has free WiFi. Played good music that was appropriate to the place. But now it's not well maintained. The dirty washroom has that wannabe feel to it with clich√© restroom quotes on badly stuck vinyl. When we wanted to order, half the items were not available including the pork chops. We ordered for the grilled chicken and ham steak along with iced tea and chicken wings for starters. I must admit the wings were sauced up properly and it was a pleasure to eat them as my friend and I were used to dining at restaurants at Singapore.
The ham steak and grilled chicken were not upto the mark at all. It was unevenly cooked. Raw at places and very soft in a few bites. Disappointed. We returned them and decided to hit a dhaba for our dinner plan. On asking for the bill we got a complimentary panna cotta and the bill was worth 1300 rupees. Didn't expect them to bill us the main course which we returned after a few bites. Anyway, don't think the place will last long. My rating 2.0 for the music, ambience, menu design and concept.

I tried the Steak factory Lake Place establishment a few days back. Limited my order to a Virgin Mojito annd tenderloin steak. The establishment is welcoming in its decor giving an old world or least 70s sort of ambience. The music is muted and so quite in taste, the steak itself is as good as it can be given the raw material available in the city. The medium preperation could be a tad more tender but what was a pleasant surprise was the sides of veggies. Carrots, sweetcorn and Caulilower, quite quite good! I would recommend this resteraunt and if there is some constructive criticism I would like to offer it would be the washbasin thats tiny. There is space to put up a larger one and I hope they do so. Further an attention to detail is what makes a business go places so stuff like seeing to it that the soap dispenser is filled should be monitored.I would patronise this place, food is good, environment cozy and service courteous

It's one of my favorite joints. The red walls, the soft music and the cordial staffs together make a lovely ambience. The food is awesome. I have tried quite a few items on the menu and each of them have exceeded our expectations. Must try - Chicken steak,Factory mixed grill and mutton meat balls.

steak factory sits tight on a small alley near menoka cinema,and the nearest landmark would be mohan clinic.the place has two rooms,the inner sanctum is opened to customers after 1.30 pm,after they are sufficiently staffed i think.the decor is minimalistic with wall hangings of john lennon and gone with the wind.the staff is courteous,and quite alert to your needs.talking about the food,the tenderloin steak was exceedingly fulfilling,the two of us ad to strive to finish it off.lamb ragout tasted even better with slices of lamb cooked deliciously in red wine and served with gnocchi(mashed potato) and veggies. spicy bubbles was a fallout,however,as we decided to experiment with the unknown and were served the very known "masala soda" instead.But never mind,I actually saw it coming.it all ended on a sweet tooth with monte carlo,a veru delightful mousse like dessert made of chocolate icecream,choco sauce,choc flakes and the very pleasant chocolate fudge cake. bon apetit!

foodie funfact #4- caramel custard/pudding is one the most familiar desserts across the culinary mainland of kolkata.In the west,its more popularly known as "flan".While many consider flan the quintessential Latin-American dessert, the first flan recipes actually hail from Ancient Rome, as early as two thousand years ago.The Romans were the first to domesticate chickens, and needed ways to use up this egg surplus. Borrowing a bit of cooking wisdom from their Greek neighbors, they created new egg-based recipes, including the flan, which means ‚Äúflat cake‚Äù in Latin.

If I am asked it describe The Stake Factory in one sentence I would say "WORTH EVER PENNY". Good food. Good ambience. 

The only feedback I have for this place - the wish they had a more specious outlet.

Recommended:
Tenderloin Cheese Steak.

Pathetic restaurant. Got fooled by the nice and trendy ambience. My dad ordered fish and chips and the fish was absolutely rotten. When we told the waiter this, he tried prove us wrong by telling us that the rotten smell was due to anchovy sauce. This of course was all rubbish. The soup they gave was starchy and full of cornflour. I will never go there again.

I must say that if you have not visited this place please go and have your favorite dish here.  We ordered tenderloin Steak,  fish carnival,  California Fish Fillet steak,  factory grilled fish and we got two desert absolutely free download from cost.  They have happy hours in the afternoon and from mon to Fri.  If you order 3 dish one dish is complimentary.  Must visit place.

Had huge expectations after reading so many rave reviews,so trudged along to Southern Avenue,but was sadly disappointed.
The ambience was cosy enough withba typical diner feel.
Ordered a Swiss salad ( Good enough) , a tenderloin steak and a ham steak. The ham steak was average,nothing exceptional. The tenderloin steak was tough and chewy. The brown gravy was good...but the quality of the steak itself was a massive letdown.
Since it was happy hours,got a dessert free and opted for a caramel custard. The custard was good but the caramel needed to make its presence felt a bit more strongly.
Not worth a second visit.

The steak factory. This Southern Avenue branch is very difficult to find. We found it totally by fluke, so sorry I can't give proper directions. All I can say is, it's near Menoka cinema Hall and if you're lucky, you will see the restaurant sign stating it's only 100mts away.
Coming to the food.
We had ordered two main course dishes and an appetizer which was just right for 3 people.
Cheese garlic bread- pretty good. It's hard to mess this up.
Grilled chicken- Roasted chicken, crisp with boiled veggies and fries. Tasty!
Factory special Cheese steak- This took it home. The gravy was delicious! Also came with a side of boiled veggies and fries. The gravy leaves you yearning for more.
Chocolate souffl√©- wasn't really a souffl√© as much as it was just chocolate mousse. So. Bad for souffl√©, good as mousse.
The ambience is nice. Fairy lights by the windows and old Hollywood posters decorating the walls. The staff were courteous and helpful. 
Overall. The dinner was a filling and satisfying one.

Me and my friend after a strenuous training reached this outlet with  our hunger at its peak!....The ambience is soothing and peaceful...decor is simple but very nice..light music being played....

First came the lamb lasagna as ordered...it was soft and moist...flavours were good and with a right balance of cheese..
Then came the ham steak..honestly i didn't like it..though it was well cooked...but its gravy tasted bad..specially a herb which was used for garnishing brought in a weird  taste...the only likeable thing in it for me was the french fries along with it..even the  sauteed veggies provided with it tasted strange!
Then we ordered the fish n chips...it was light and simple...came with a mayo sauce which was good...but overall it was very okayish..not much of flavours...

Now to our delight we could order one more dish of our choice..that to main course for free...it was the happy hours offer...not many people know about this..
1main course free with three of them..or...1 desert free with two main course...simply great!

Anyways the best should always be in store for the last..and exactly that it was!!...we chose the free dish to be chicken ala neapolitan..a pricey one:p..the dish was just  lovely...the chicken was perfectly grilled...flavoured and succulent...with baked egg and cheese...little vegetables..mushrooms and smashed potatoes..leading to a great combination of taste!...this one and the lamb lasagna you must try when you get there.

And at the end for such a wholesome lunch we just paid Rs1033 and left the restro with a already decided mind to revisit it soon!!

Service at The Steak Factory is despicable, discreditable,unscrupulous and cheap. After we came back home we found one entire dish, the blackened fish, not packed and we had ordered two dishes for our parents. It was raining heavily and we reached home close to 10 pm. Imagine how upset we were when we saw our mum and dad sharing the food because there was not enough. My sister immediately called up the restaurant to inform them of their genuine mistake. Yes, we get that there's a bigger rush during the weekend and a lot of people had to be catered to. Still, that does not call for such rude behaviour. You did not offer to deliver the food to our place since it's "too far" for delivery. You're not willing to give a refund. How convenient that you cut the bill but don't see the loss the customer has to incur. Why should I come back for another sour experience? You're food is not that great. I'd much rather spend my buck where I'm treated with some dignity. Money does not come free. It may have been a genuine mistake from your end but the way you (who we spoke to on the phone) casually dispersed this incident, tossing it aside like we're garbage should know better than to treat your customers with such a lackadaisical approach. I'm not saying to kiss my ass because I'm paying for your service, I'm saying my money is not worth your casualness. It's not a frivolous matter.

Food is exquisite! Quite out of the box for first time Calcuttans. Tried Factory Mix Grill having chicken, mutton, mushroom, sausage & French fries which was bland yet wholesome & different. Also must try is Chicken Parmigiana having chicken breast deep fried & crumb coated with mozzarella cheese & on the side was mashed potatoes and vegetables.
For deserts do try Monte Carlo - chocolate cake & ice cream assortment with hot chocolate sauce & chocolate chips.

The decor is a fall back to the American type diners

I decided to visit this place after the rave reviews in an article by t2 on the best eateries in Southern Avenue. However, I had an experience which was just about okay, but nothing to convince me to visit more than once. The place is a bit hard to find, through the lanes of Southern Avenue. The use of space for seating is quite intelligent, making a 30 seater area in two small rooms..
Now coming to the food, we ordered chicken wings, Chicken Parmigiana and Factory mixed grill. The wings were much like the ones you get in Dominos, although I felt they were slightly undercooked. The Chicken Parmigiana was disappointing, with the cheese crust tasting more like a tomato puree, while the chicken was like a regular deep fried cutlet. The mix grill had chicken and pieces of pork, and was tasty. No room or enthusiasm for desserts. The experience was not bad, but did not leave me wanting to come back again.

Heard so much about this place and was totally excited to visit. But I was disappointed by their service. We ordered a chicken steak and a mutton pot roast. They served the steak within 10-15 mins and it was delicious. We were waiting for the second dish to arrive for more than 50 mins and still there was no sign of it. We called another waiter and he checked with the kitchen and told us it will take another 30mins at least. We replaced the order with another chicken steak which was full of salt!
A certain dish may take time to prepare, but the staff should have the courtesy to let the customer know about it. I might have a second visit, but if the service remains the same then I won't be going back.

It was my first time at The Steak Factory and I would love to go back again and again. The waiters were cordial and the food was served really quick. The ambience was good. 

The food that we ordered were bacon wrapped prawns, pork sizzler and tenderloin steak. Bacon wrapped prawns were awesome. Pork sizzlers were good too. They give a gravy with tenderloin steaks and that enhances the taste of the meat.

I would definitely want to go back and taste the other steaks. :)

We (spouse and son alongwith myself) reached the restaurant at around 2 pm after driving for around one and quarter hours amidst heavy rain and associated traffic snarl and were really hungry and myself, a bit tired after all the long drive. The restaurant looks rather small with only two rooms and there was of course an immediate nervous how it will be in terms of food quality. The occasion was our anniversary lunch and obviously should not turn out to be sour. The ambience was cool and comfortable with a cowboy hat and typical western movie snaps all around in a slightly dim atmosphere. We ordered Factory Mixed Grill, Factory Grilled Fish, Chicken Sizzler and garlic bread to start with. Once we were about to complete all this), we were enlightened with the option of ordering a free dish and ordered fish carnival. All the dishes were well cooked and particularly the fish (basa, which I could guess and was confirmed) was really good for fish lovers like us. To be on the safer side we had asked the dishes to be prepared a bit more spicy and so we were really delighted. We were still ravenous and had Chocolate Souffle & Chocolate Monte Carlo for dessert. Overall it was a very good experience and we went back with a really stretched stomach with all the good food and heart full of satisfaction. The option is economic as well with the bill around Rs. 1800.

I had bookmarked this place for a long time. Finally had the opportunity and went there with a friend of mine. Not a big place, serves at about 30-32 people at a time I think. We went post 2pm so there were not too many persons around. You'll notice that they serve one free main course after you order three before or one dessert course free of cost if you order two before, during Monday to Friday afternoons. For a foodie like me it was a blessing indeed. The ambience was ideal for stopping by and ordering good food and have a chat with your pals. We ordered  chicken parmigiana and chicken stroganoff. Stroganoff was delicious but Chicken Parmigiana wasn't up to the mark, according to my friend. Later I ordered Chicken steak and then Ham steak for myself. Have to say both were really wonderful to taste, specially Ham steak which I really enjoyed. Overall the food was good. Didn't taste the dessert options available though. Cost us 1150 rupees. Will I go there again? Definitely yes. What will I order? Definitely ham steaks. A lot of them, indeed. Any negatives? Washroom. They take some time while serving foods but I wasn't complaining. But you might. 4 stars.

Came here on a sunday evening. Thoroughly enjoyed myself. Very sumptuous food. I had bacon wrapped shrimp, pork sizzler and tenderloin steak. All of them were outstanding.. both in terms of taste and presentation.

The only flaw that I feel was with my dessert. I had ordered a chocolate souffle.. but was instead given a mousse. Not complaining exactly.. cos I love both. 

Do come here if you love your meat!

Below is a picture of bacon wrapped shrimp. Enjoy!

I am a meat crave, so this place is perfect for me. Heard about this place so long ago and was planning for a long time to hunch. Finally got time yesterday & me & my husband went there. We had Ham Streak and Factory Mixed Grill. Steak was perfectly cooked & was so tender & yummy, still my mouth is watering. Factory Mixed Grill was of Chicken pieces, pork sausages, mutton slices, onions and colorful bell papers. It comes with a fine taste of pepper. This dish was also tasty.

Ambiance was also good with cozy sitting arrangements and rock music. In one line, I like this place a lot...

Completely misled  with the shrimp cocktail dish.. Coming to the main course pork chop steak was tasting like boiled lump of meat and mutton steak was equally bland.. Overall the food was pretty tasteless and stakes do not live up to the expectation..

If the location part is forgotten, then the restaurant should get a 5/5. It was my birthday and we decided to try out this place for lunch though it was post 4 pm. Well, finding it was a bit tricky one (I actually had to use my GPS) but once you enter the place, you can feel that it is a totally US themed joint. With typical US posters and Pics on the wall and the cowboy hat on the shelf, one can pretty well guess that the designer has visited mostly the southern part of The US. The staff are pretty courteous and efficient. We ordered stuffed mushroom caps for starters came with an amazing dip. Though the size of the mushrooms were not same but the taste made it up. For main course we ordered a Lamb Lasagna & Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken with Creamy Mushroom sauce with a plate of cheese garlic bread. The Lasagna was out of the world treat. I was amazed at the quality and the quantity of the dishes. The chicken had a generous stuffing of ham, spinach and other meat topped up with a fantastic sauce. The garlic bread was overloaded with cheese. We were also served mocktails which were perfectly blended. As a part of their happy hour (12-6) on every 2 main course you get a dessert and on every 3 main course you get another main course free. So we got our caramel custard free. If you are a vegeterian then this place is NOT for you, and meat lovers, this is where you need to be. It was my first visit but I can vouch that it won't be the last.

Nice Cosy Restaurant off Southern Avenue ...Chili Pork, Bacon Wrapped Prawns, Chicken Wings, Nachos & the Irish Broth were All Excellent ! Potato Salad should have been served cooler & the Shrimp Cocktail as well ... Pot Roast Mutton was Delicious but the Mutton needed to be more Tender definitely ... Chicken Parmigiana was average,  Fish & Chips were very Good, Mixed Grill was average & The Tenderloin Steak ordered Medium Rare was kinda Chewy ! Zomato shows the special Steak Menu but they are not serving the different versions such as Rib Eye, Cheesy Steak etc as yet ! Monte Carlo in Desserts was very Ordinary but the Caramel Custard was nice ... Service is Friendly & eager - No Doubt But they need to be better trained for a Restaurant such as this ... Moreover, the Noise Level from the Kitchen is quite Disturbing specially with the staff screaming at each other. Decent Music played is welcome ... Toilets need to be more presentable done up & cleaner ...

The Steak Factory- A meat lover's ultimate destination. This place is tucked away in a lane almost midway between the kalighat and rabindra sarobar metro stations at a very convenient location. The restaurant is dimly light inside with low-hanging lamps and the crimson walls are hung with posters of old hollywood classics and woody allen,marilyn monroe, elvis presley. Also with an awesome background score featuring Bon Jovi, Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Richard Marx, Poets of the Fall (I was mentally blessing them for this) and some soothing insrumentals, it set the perfect mood for the perfect meal that followed. First off, we ordered Lamb Ragout. It was sensational. Chicken Cordon Bleu which followed next, was a orgasmic combination of all my favourite items- chicken, ham, swiss cheese wrapped and crumb fried and served with french fries. It was brilliantly prepared and something you just can't have enough of. But the biggest disappointment was that my much coveted Barbeque Pork Ribs was not available (Well all the more reason to visit again). They have a happy hours scheme going on from 12noon to 6pm where, if you order three main courses, you get the fourth one on the house and on ordering two main courses, you get a dessert free. And so we were delighted to polish off our free dessert, chocolate monte carlo. It was quite tasty but kind of overshadowed by the mighty and meaty main courses. Our bill came out to be Rs. 793 for two which is pretty reasonable according to the standards of service and the quality of food served. Now that I have found my 'meat haven', this place calls for so many more hungry visits.

This is a long pending review from my side. Been there during a rainy weekend. To start with and to express my "Stepping out" feelings I will say "it was Osssummmmm". After entering the restaurant the American diner kind of ambience will draw your attention. Wall frames featuring 60-70s Hollywood world. Wooden 2-3 seater benches make a perfect fit. I am a big fan of steaks and onion rings. And they served it quite good. I had the lamb steak and it was delicious. It was served with properly cooked vegetables which does not allow the taste of lamb to get disappeared. My companion had the "Mixed Factory Grill", basically a meat platter designed with chicken/lamb and vegetables. This platter will keep your mouth full. We were there during happy hours and they served a complimentary dessert which felt awesome on taste buds and wallet. :)
To suggest:
Have to keep salt an pepper on the table (not sure if it due to lack of situation readiness since we dropped in during noon/off-peak time)
Add a few more bread options like bread roll in the menu( My personal favorite though)
These might be because its a comparatively newer joint.
Overall, good food, nice ambience, easy on wallet. Keep serving the good food. There are other restaurants which serves steak, but with the ambience, the food and the wallet I can say your love for steak is not in " STAKE". Cheers.....

My mother was nagging the life out of me to visit this place as it's just around the corner from my house. I finally granted her wish this time and took her to dinner on my last night in Kolkata, which was like just a week back.¬†

The smoked baby potatoes were a turn off. There was nothing smoked about them and they looked like they were side orders from a main-dish. The red marinated gravy around it made no sense and thy potatoes were mashed. The quantity they served was not of a starter but of a main-dish.¬†

The Grilled Bhetki Sizzler was not outstanding and they forgot the vegetables on the side. The meat was undercooked and lacked the blending of flavours. Just because it comes spluttering on your table, doesn't mean its cooked.¬†

The Chicken Ala-kiev was equally disappointing, particularly because it lacked the overflow of melted butter when it was cut. The trademark of the dish begins with that performance. The meat was alright and nothing exceptional. Places like Mocambo and Saturday Club have set the standards with this dish.¬†

The ambience is nice but service is poor. The time taken between the drinks, the starters and the main course is badly managed.

A tiny, uncomfortable, poorly lit restaurant shouldn't be glorified with the term, "cozy." Be prepared to have your food served after a good 45-50 minutes, and the garlic toast served a further 15 minutes later, when you just have some gravy left on your plate. The food was cold, and the portions were devastatingly small! Plus, passing off shrimps as tiger prawns and a horrible Indian vegetable curry with no sign of pasta as red sauce pasta, are absolutely unacceptable, especially when the menu card is so much heavier on the right! The Steak Factory should be renamed The Disappointment Factory!

Calcuttans, used to sizzlers at Mocambo or Peter Cat, can never be satisfied with food simply served on a sizzler base being called a sizzler, when it doesn't even sizzle. Moreover, one shouldn't call shrimps, tiger prawns! If you still feel like going there, make sure you keep some food back in your fridge, because the portions are so small that you won't even have a full stomach to console your empty purse! I wish there was a negative star...

Firstly beautiful cozy place to hang out with friends, keeping a traditional layout (American cuisine bar) with a touch of Indian furnishing thus doing justice with the name. And the most important thing I liked is the music playlist in the background, typical American taste of Gun N Roses, AC/DC, etc added to the mood. Sausages are complementary..I tried out the Factory Mixed Grill (nice flavor), the Tenderloin Steak (beef, meat was literally tender as opposed to the actual beef texture) and the Ham Steak (meat texture was fantastic with a tangy sauce)...finally finished off with Chocolate Brownie (with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce) and Caramel Custard (the one I'd recommend everyone). To my experience outstanding place to grab a dinner with friends/family (no hard drinks though)
Good news - A new outlet is coming up at Salt Lake Sector 3 with a bar facility...kudos to that! :)

I have heard a lot about steak factory. And surely, the best place for steak in kolkata.

It's a meat lover's place.
We were 2 people went for lunch.
It was happy hours.
It's a small place with nice ambiance and good music.
We ordered pork chop and tenderloin steak.
We got a desert free.

The pork chop was really good.
The tenderloin steak was also good.

Would love to try their sizzlers someday.

Cheers.

Had heard a lot about the place! Finally visited with three of my friends. Let's start with the ambience.  The place is like just awesome. The framed pics go soo well with the surroundings. Now, moving over to the food. The food was delicious. They were all well cooked and tasty. Lamb lassagne was just lovely. Enjoyed every bite of our dinner. The cost is well under adjusted with the quantity and quality of food they provide, no complaints there. And there service was top notch also. Eagerly waiting to visit again!

Have been there a couple of times. Few dishes are simply outstanding and the rest is also quite good. Some of the mouth watering items are "prawn wrapped in bacon, ham steak, beef steak , chicken steak , lasagna "...and yes do not and i repeat do not miss the brownie dessert. Service is OK.

A good restaurant may be..but a total failure with Home Delivery option. I was confirmed a delivery within 40 minutes which ultimately took more than 1 hr 40 mins. I was told that according to my preference a spaghetti carhonara will be tailor made as pene carbonara which was ultimately not done. Home Delivery not suggested ay all.

Me and my friend finally had a chance to.visit this place as we have been hearing pretty good stuff about this place. We went in on a weekend and the place was lively and packed with people and music. We loved the theme and ambience of the place. It had a certain vive to it. We asked the waiter about the available steaks and there started our disappointment . He said no proper steak menu was availble and one and only tenderloin steak was there. So we ordered a midimum grilled steak and with chhese breads. The steak was awful and it was barely chewable. The size.were also.extremely uneven for.both of us. Its like ordering half plate and full plate but nevertheless we couldnt finish it at all . Bread was good.and so was the mojito . We left the place with a hint of dissatisfaction and would rather avoid.

This place had been on my wish list for some time,finally visited it today for a late lunch.Thanks to the directions provided in the zomato reviews,it wasn't very hard to find.The interiors are very cozy and have a retro feel,loved it.Food was excellent.Although the portion sizes are not very big,we visited during happy hours(12 to 6) and got 1 main course free on order of 3 main courses,which proved to be more than enough for the 3 of us.We ordered chicken steak,factory special mixed grill,chicken stroganoff,spaghetti bolognese and chocolate monte carlo,for dessert.The steak was tender and juicy,the mixed grill was amazing especially the sausages.Spaghetti bolognese and chicken stroganoff both were really yummy!couldn't choose which one I liked best.Chocolate monte carlo was good,but nothing too special.Overall it was a great experience,would love to visit again..

I was never exactly a fan of steak, but courtesy Steak Factory, I think I will be eating steak on my deathbed now. One of the places in Calcutta that can cook a steak to perfection. (And the veggies, gravy and mashed potatoes on the side are heartwarming and delicious.) The ambience is beautiful and new, something I've not seen before. It's simple, they don't try to hard to be different, which is why it works out. And they play great music too. If you want to eat steak (and other things) without your pocket burning on fire, or even if you simply want good food, Steak Factory is your place. (Chili's, go home.)

I have visited their other venue in new alipore few years before. But to be true, the 1st time I did not enjoy much. Mostly cause I ordered some sort off chicken salady thing. Also, back then I had only liking for mughlai n Bengali dishes. I never used to be a fan or harness any liking for the continental genre of food. But thank god, I have developed a new taste for other genre of food.
This time I decided to visit the newly opened venue of steak factory in southern avenue. Oh boy, did I like it!!
If u enter the southern avenue road, drive past the boulevard, till u see the swimming pool. Take the right turn from the front of the pool drive straight, 1st u will cross the kabir road, then the road leading to menoka, then on the 3rd crossing look left n u will see their signboard.
It has a nice rustic decor, wooden chairs, cramped for space and cosy lighting. With the slight drizzle outside, I was welcomed to an empty place filled with my favourite numbers from 3 doors down, Jon bon jovi, Bryan Adams...I had a feeling that the evening would be perfect.
Now to the food, this time we ordered right and from a plaque!! Yes they have their menus turned to a plaque. I thought of hitting my companions with the plaque ;).

No salady, healthy bullshit this time. I ordered a chicken roasted half n my companions, one plate of spaghetti stroganoff n fish n chips.
The roasted chicken was a dish comprised of 2 of the "softiest" ( softy n tastiest) large pieces of chicken covered by a yummy thick layer of gravy/sauce sort off thing, unhealthy, unwanted pieces of veggies and healthy quantity of healthy French fries. They gave a knife for the chicken, the spoon was enough to scoop of the chunk of flesh from the pieces. The gravy, made of yogurt, mayo, cheese n other things was pure poetry, yummy.
The spaghetti was nice, cooked in brown sauce and other unhealthy milk products n filled with huge quantity of soft chicken pieces and mushroom, I liked it. Only I wish, it was a bit more spicy!!
The fish n chips is standard Bengali favourite of 2 good soft pieces of bhetki deeply fried but thin coated served with chips I.e. the French fry n huge dip of tartar sauce. I loved it too.
To sum it up, I liked their decor, the alluring posters n wall hangings of Marilyn Monroe, to cramped space n the awesome collection of music they have. The food, its amazing.... Copybook finger licking delicious!!
Ps it cost us 900 bux approx. It was 5pm so couldn't have a whole meal. Next time definitely will try the pork ribs n have a complete meal.

Word of caution: Last page of that menu does not exist yet. So no Ribeye for me last night.
Last night those guys were swamped. They were all over the place. Not everything on the menu was available and they could not attend everyone, everytime. They served wrong things to wrong people and forgot orders and so on and so forth. But they were polite and smiling, not something you get in Kolkata.
And then there was the steak, so far the best I have had in Kolkata. So I'm going back for more.
Ambiance is ok, a little eclectic but I'm not judging. Perhaps a little crowded for a private conversation, especially on a busy night but great if you're with friends. I wish they had beer though.
Must try.

I have been to the new alipore outlet several times but this was my firt time in the southern avenue one...some people complained about not able to find the venue and i can understand why but i was quickly able to spot it...to help others, keep menoka cinema on to your right and the lake on your left and move forward for about 100mtrs, tak the first right cut that you will get and go straight, Steak Factory will be on your left...nice big well lit board outside...

this review will definitely compare the two branches a bit and here comes the first one....way more spacious and looks very neat....the interiors and furnitures are almost the same from new alipore outlet, the walls are painted in a different style...and also the cutleries looked a little different too...

Coming to the food straightway...we ordered bacon wrapped prawns, chelo kebab and lamb lasagna....and i will be a litte critical this time of the food...while otherwise i love the food served at this joint....

the bacon were way to thick and was not crispy for that reason, the dish already left a lot of water which you can see in the pic...the prawns were succulent and the dip served was tasty...overall it tastes good but please get thinner slices and make them crispy, this one tasted like almost boiled, it might be a one odd case too....

Chelo kebab...the moment it was plated in front of me, the color of the seekh kebab and chicken kebab made me feel they used food color, nt sure if thats true but they were ridiculously red....and both the kebab stick looks same, please get some contrast, the plate will look better, the parsley rice was smooth and tasted good but the kebabs were not as good as i expected them to be, may be you can do something, add lemon or some contrasting spices to lift up the taste and flavor....also, the plater missed grilled tomatoes or french fries..i know every restaurant has their own style but this one looked a litte boring...u can add another 10 bucks to ur cost and make it look lottt better....

Lamb Lasagna...was very heavy for 1 portion...and thats one good thing about this joint....they will never dissapoint you in portion sizes, atleast in most of their recipes...it looked great...smelled great and tasted great...smooth, cheesy, full of flavor and the lasagna sheets well cooked...one thing to mention and thats not a complain, the mince tasted very indian but then again, thats for the large chunk of diners who wants to eat continental food but they cant handle typical tastes feeling them as little bland and the owners might have improvized here...

Chocolate monte carlo...a very simple arrangement made to look classy.....and i loved the concept and this is what makes me happy...chefs and entreprenuers taking simple things, innovating and taking it to a different level....great presentation....tastes good and again as always....HEAVY.....

the outlet was busy and people at one point queued outside to get a seat, on a rainy sunday evening...this joint is definitely a place to visit but i really hope they work on these finer aspects....i know the price they charge, Ishould not be expecting the perfect stuff but some of these wont even cost them much...and also, its about 3 yrs old now and this is where they wud have to get more matured...

May i just add one last point...i visited the new alipore outlet a month ago and ordered fish and chips....what i got was an extremely fresh bhetki...crumb fried....a piece of suggestion, this British classic is always batter fried...i dint complained coz the fish quality was excellent but may be you can tell the chef...or call it a fish colbert....

Had a lot of expections about this place.We ordered Tenderloin Steak and Cheese Garlic bread.Steak was not at all worth the hype.This was some below average steak.We had to give a lot of effort to cut the meat in the first place and also taste was not at all good.Ambience of this place was very good and thats why the 3 rating is for.When the name of a resturant is The STEAK factory , people will first expect the steak to be it's speciality.But here is a entirely different story of it.I won't recommend to go to this place.

Reaching the restaurant could be a bit tricky but once you are there, you will definitely like the food. Don't go if you do not like meat because you will not find much of an option but the name itself should be sufficient to make you understand what they serve. Finally a nice place to eat which is at walkable distance

The Steak Factory has been on my wish list for a long time.Finally had the opportunity to visit.It's a small place near Menoka Cinema.It has two small rooms.The ambiance is nice.The place is decorated with old film posters.:D Now coming to the food,we ordered tenderloin steaks,which were not available unfortunately.So we ordered chicken steaks,a ham steak,a mixed factory grill!The steaks were good,although quantity was a little less I felt.The mixed factory grill was just bland.:/
Overall a good place for steaks,but sadly I had greater expectations from this place.
Hats off for the free WiFi and the Happy Hours offer though!:P Ordered 4 dishes and only had to pay for 3!^_^ Happy Steak Eating!

The steak factory is one place about which I have heard a lot. And surely, the boastings are worth it. Had been here for lunch today. The experience was awesome. The outlook is just like a simple household from outside. Once you enter, the collection of film, music and other quirky posters in frame on the wall will catch your look. I liked the idea and there are many of my favourite film posters and banksy, too! Now comes the most important part, food! It's 'awesome' in one word. Although we searched for tenderloin, pork steak or bbq pork ribs one by one from the steak menu, they were not available. That gives it a thumbs down. We had ordered cocktail sausages, nachos, spicy chilli pork, sea food sizzler and chocolate monte carlo. There were lime sodas too. Everything was perfect except the monte carlo and the lime sodas. There were just okay and of an average standard. Otherwise the experience is really good. The staffs are pretty courteous and their hand made cookies are great too. If you're are a meat lover this can be your next stop. Happy Dining! :)

Finally...been to this place!!!! Well...we had ham wrappd pawns wch ws simply awesome.....mutton steak....factory special sizzler...and pork sizzler......!!!!
Food was good...i wont say out of the world.....but d price was too high...and quantity served was too less....it wasnt worth the value....food was really too less in quantity....supplemented with a lot of sidies like inions and capsicums.....!!! In comparison to other reknowned eatouts in the city...special mention to the 2 to 3 popular n famed sizzler restros at park street....i guess going back to this place again....i would definitely like to give it a 2nd or a 3rd thought....cz the quantity served was disgracefully unacceptable and not upto the standard compared to the other eatouts in the city!!! Positive?? Well quality was good....but that is all....pocket or stomach friendly!!!!

Ok, here is the big disappointment! Had heard a lot about the place before visiting, thus expectation was sky high. So last Friday, went for dinner with my husband.
Without a doubt, the interior is something that will find appreciation. Although minimalist with details and not too snazzy, its warm and welcoming. Also, the posters and framed photos of some of the biggest Hollywood flicks against the wall adds added charm, though making no big contribution to the overall theme of the interior.
Now, coming to the food. After much deliberation over the menu in which every item read exotic and delicious, we ordered the grilled fish, pork sizzler, chelo kebab and virgin mojoto.
The portions are too less. The pork sizzler, unlike the ones in most popular eateries, was not succulent enough. Also, it was too less in portions for the price and not all that tasty. Next is chelo kebab, which was sadly, not like chelo at all. The kebabs were tough and not tender, the rice was not buttery enough. The egg was cooked too much. Everything was just too horribly wrong with this classic delicacy unfortunately. Maybe the fact that it was the last hour of the day which impacted the quality of the dish.
The saving grace was the grilled fish. Cooked to perfection. It was just the right amount juicy, succulent and mind blowingly tasty. And for that, I would visit again!
I am willing to overlook the flaws and visit again, solely due to the general good reviews it has received.

Visited this small but power packed restaurant last afternoon...this was pending for a long time...was happy with the fact that it remains open all day...all though the seating area is small,yet it is very nicely done with red walls.
Coming to the food,we ordered spicy chilli pork for starters,it tasted very good.guess this is the only restaurant where the pork wasnt shredded and the pieces were full of meat and no fat.For mains we ordered Lamb Ragout,Mixed seafood sizzler and Factory special mixed grill sizzler.The lamb was too die for,soft well done lamb pieces in red wine sauce served with fluffy gnochhi which just melts in your mouth.Moving on to the seafood sizzler,it has pieces of squid,fish,prawns in white sauce and tasted so fresh and delicate.Also the factory special mixed grill had an Indian twist to it.For dessert we ordered Chocolate Monte Carlo (had read a lot about it in the zomato reviews) which was a total let down,it had evrtything that an awesome dessert should have but somehow couldnt relish it much.
The bill came upto rs2100 which was totally worth it.It can be totally tagged as Meat -Lovers Paradise...will definitely visit again.

I went there to have lunch with my girlfriend and to have a good time together. Both me and my friend were impressed by the quality of the food and enjoyed the amazing steak they make. The food was really yum and those who love to eat steak should definitely visit this place. From the factory specials to regular steak, each item is unique in taste and served with affection. One has to give credit to the service they provide and the rock mix they play which takes you back to your teenage days. The ambience is cool and I liked the wooden chair and the red brick wall. Besides the steak, one could also try the dessert Monte Carlo. Would love to visit again.

Fantasic steak. Nice ambience. Friendly staff. Good service. Authentic food. Great music. Very good experience, went back the second time. Will be back for a third. 
Revision:
Extremely overpriced food. They should change their price for two according to their new menu. Had mixed grill swimming in jhol, and extremely fatty, dry pork chop. Very disappointed to see how their quality has fallen.

its a medium sized cozy 1st floor of a bungalow with a very good ambience !!!

i loved the food, the steaks were good with a generous portion but it was slightly dry and there was no rice or noodles or a dinner roll with it which according to me is a necessary accompaniment with a steak !! the side dishes we ordered were great too, but the king of the menu according to me was the au gratin, I guess this is the best gratin I've ever had!! we had also orderd quasedilla which was good and the deserts were great too

I have crossed the steak factory in New Alipore quite a few times as it's located on my way home. Somehow, it always remained like one of those restaurants that you hear about a lot but you don't actually visit. Finally, got rid of this block when I finally planned lunch in the southern avenue outlet with a friend. Although small, the joint is quite compact. The decor is neat and suits the tone of the place perfectly. Now coming to the food- we ordered the ham steak and the spaghetti carbonara. The steak was a delight and the pasta was nice. However, the beverages have a lot of scope for improvement. Fancy names for the drinks are a tad bit misleading. On the whole, the experience was good. All set to try the one in New Alipore now.

Dropped in at this place in the day time. It has two small rooms. One of the two rooms was in use. Because of the small room size it is a little cramped if a few tables are occupied. In this room three four seater and two two seater tables are laid out. Total seating is 16 in a 100 sft room - cramped!!! Thus the look is of a coffee corner. 
The walls are decorated with framed Hollywood celebrities' photos.
There is one AC here but these days daytime one Additional fan would be required. Otherwise you have to seat in the direction of the AC blower.
Plus points - They have western music playing and wifi for customers. Started writing the review there.
Pork ribs were not available and Pork chops  being little too fatty was not advised.
Ordered Mutton steak and Lamb Lasagna for two. Waiting time to serve is about 15+ minutes.
Mutton steak was done with Red Wine Concase sauce. Lasagna with Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese. Both the dishes were well done with fresh meat, were filling and tasty. Two dishes were enough for two persons. One dish here is just right for one person. Doesn't burden you with excess quantity.
They now have a happy hour and give one sweet dish with two main courses free during happy hour. They served Chocolate Monte Carlo as the happy hour free dish. It was very chocolaty with different fruits and dry fruits. This is really sweet and satisfying. One sweet dish is just right for two.
On the whole a bold venture doing their job well. Wish they had more space the place is well cooled in summer daytime.
Our bill came to Rs 700/- only which is reasonable. Tax on Rs 700/- was Rs 141/- which is a crime by those who impose such high rates of taxes on food - an index of underdevelopment of the Indian Politician!

This place was recommended by zomato and we decided to try this place out on the day of my mom's birthday. 
The ambience is really nice as it has this old American vibe with posters of Jimi Hendrix, The Doors etc hanging off the walls and The Eagles playing in the background. It really took me back to those cozy restaurants in the US. When it comes to their ambience, I would give it a 10/10. 

There was a very wide range of choices when it comes to the food. I liked the fact that they had all American favourite zucchini fritters and delicious sounding appetisers like bacon wrapped shrimp. The main course we tried a variety of main courses from their steak to their baked dishes and even their pork sizzler. The quantity of food was wholesome and honestly great! When it comes to the quality of food it was absolutely delicious and mouth watering! They are truly bringing an American Flavour to our good ol' Kolkata. 
Their service was hospitable, really nice and attentive. This place is a must visit for meat lovers and people who generally love food and a great night out with good food!

Was there this saturday night. The place was thriving with guests. The ambience and decor of this place just added up to my wonderful experience. We were greeted with much warmth of the servers. Ordered for chilli pork and baked chicken ala napolitano. The presentation of both these dishes were too good. The chilli pork was simply mouth watering. We devoured every piece of it.Coming to baked chicken ala napolitano it disolved in my mouth. The meat was so very soft not chewy at all. We wrapped up our dinner with chocolate brownie and strawberry souffle. The desserts just added up.to the whole meal. Its a must visit for all the foodies.

Went in for dinner last night with few friends. I must say this is not my first visit. This place keeps on luring me to come back again and again. Tried two new dishes baked chicken ala napolitano and barbeque crab. I must say the crab was just exotic. The flavours and the sauce reminded me of Goa. The baked chicken was simply divine. It melted in my mouth. My friends enjoyed every bit of these dishes. Wrapped up this scrumptious meal with caramel custarad.

Had a wholesome meal to quench my craving for meat. Located near Menoka Cinema a small place like hidden gem for continental lovers.

Ordered Lamb Lasagne and Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken. Lasagne was minced lamb soaked in red wine baked with mozzarella cheese. Chicken was grilled breast portion stuffed with prosciutto and topped with creamy mushroom sauce. Both just awestruck me with its taste.

The climax was encounter with Chocolate Monte Carlo. Fine sheet of brownie served with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce topped with cherry.

Price is expensive, INR 973 inclusive taxes. But servers need training. They lack basic courtesy like telling name of the dish while serving on table or a word of caution if the vessel is hot in case of baked dish or to switch on AC when its stuffy during summer afternoon or even serving bill on table without asking if guests would prefer something else. Such improvements will make it a better place for sure.

Twice i have been to this place and on both occasions i was blown away by the awesomeness of the steaks. I am a huge fan of steaks and i must say that this is one of the best steak joints in kolkata. First day we had ordered cheese tenderloin steak,pork ribs and lamb lasagna. Next day we had pork ribs,pork sizzler, ham steak and bacon wrapped prawns. Every single dish was delicious. The ambience was awesome too. A bit of booze would have added to the fun but the pinnacoladas were fine. To sum up it was an awesome experience and i am looking forward to visit steak factory again üòä

I went to Steak House couple of weeks back with a friend of mine¬†on her suggestion to try out a new restaurant. The location is in a residential area and it would almost seem like you are barging into someone's home (because that's what it is). The ambience is nice and quiet.¬†
We ordered a Pork chop, a Ham steak, a lemon tea and a Virgin Pinacolada. The Pork Chop and Ham Stake were both accompanied with mashed potato, and veggies. The meat was succulent and tasted heavenly (I am salivating while typing this). The drinks were good too but then we were not there for the drinks really .... :D¬†
My suggestion... If you are a meat lover, visit this place at least once.... it will be worth it...

Today was my first visit at The steak factory... What an amazing place... Lovely ambience as well as warm reception ... Food was delicious... We ordered cajun fish fry , chicken cheese steak , lamb lasagnia ... One of the best continental food I ever had in Kolkata.
The lasagnia is strongly recommended if u like cheesy dish... Fish quality was appreciable.... In dessert we ordered chocolate Monte Carlo it was yum.... At the end I can say every should visit once this place... Highly recommend and appreciated .. Also they provide free Wi Fi :)

Steak Factory is surely the one of the best I have come across while pleasing my taste buds. Starting with chicken salad, each and every item was really awesome. Well the price may seem a bit on the higher side. But don't mind, you'll be satisfied in the end though. The ambience and music plays a great role. It portrays the 80's or 90's place with an authentic touch.

What a place! I loved the ambience. Tiny, cosy. dimly lit, small but really homely. The people were really very polite and good. I loved the food too. We ordered lamb lasagna, chicken steak, mojito and choc brownie with ice cream and hot choc sauce. What an awesome. Im coming here again to try out the other items.

Tucked in a cosy little residential area in southern avenue near the lake temple road, this place is the perfect place to escape the hustle bustle of Kolkata. Even though a bit difficult to find, the restaurant itself is quaint and the ambience and decor is simplistic and pleasant to the eyes. I ordered the mutton steak and the steak itself was phenomenal.. With the taste of the steaked meat and the spicy curry to top the steak off, You cannot ask for a more filling meal.. Dont mind the extra bucks because it is for sure a unique and thrilling experience. The sides served with the steak can have a bit more twist though.. The combination of boiled veges and fried inions tends to be bit bland with the combination.. Overall, I wouldn't mind asking for seconds!

The best chicken steak in town.Dethroning my previous favorite Veselka in that department. The Tetrazzini another winner and the tenderloin steak,my first try was unusually succulent and delicious. The chocolate brownie with ice cream completed my heavenly meal with a burp and a happy sigh.

We went to this outlet this Sunday for lunch. First of all this place was not for couple... Tables are placed so much near to each other that we hard voice from other table...we ordered Fish N Chips and Shirley temple...the drink was as expected, but the Fish had a very bad smell that we could not eat. And one more thing items which are showcasing in their menu item you hardly got it in your plate. We are very disappointed.

Last night was a pleasant surprise for us. After much going around we spotted the STEAK FACTORY near Menoka Cinema. The place was not really inviting to look at and needed a bit of sprucing up to do, I think. Also, the moment we entered the restaurant on the ground floor of a humble two-storied old building in a gulli, what hit us was the smell from the heated kitchen somewhere in the background and too much traffic of customers and people serving in a small cosy room. ¬†Needs a major Exhaust job indeed.It looked cluttered and shabby and so we were taken in to another room next to it. Not much different though. But what I was impressed with was the MENU CARD, American Frontier Cowboy style and the list of items mentioned looked yummy. We settled for some steak, Fish & Chips & Chicken Parmejiano. Each item was delicious and so we congratulated Chef Gomes and his assistant. In every respect the dishes were tasty, even though I expected a little more generous helping of the cheese toppings.¬†
For the food , we must go back again but do expect the place to look less shabby.

Keep Calm and Have a Steak!

There are still surprises in this city teeming with pop up restaurants and big name eateries jostling for elbow space and demanding their share of attention. We were looking for an untried place and found ‚ÄúThe Steak Factory‚Äù in a quiet, almost totally residential lane; there was a blackboard outside, listing the day‚Äôs specials!

Once we stepped inside, we realized that it was an old house, done up to create a warm ambience, seating people over 3 rooms. Their tables and benches were a tad small so on a bad day you could end up knocking elbows with people at the next table;

We ordered four individual dishes, and a serving of Garlic bread (crisp, well seasoned and delicious) while we waited for our Main courses.  My Fish n Chips was fresh Beckty (Not Basa thank god!!)  and the Tartar Sauce, made from scratch, blew me away! Chicken Parmigianino with lashings of Mozzarella; Fish Carnival was lightly flavored and their Ham Steak succulent!  Perfect seasoning, authentic flavors, crisp vegetables and quick service made it even better. They excelled at Desserts as well ~ light and fluffy Strawberry Souffl√©, wickedly decadent Chocolate Monte Carlo and a smooth Caramel Custard made it an utterly satisfying meal. 

Huge compliments to Chef Anand Gomes and sous Chef Nilkamal Roy. 

This place needs to expand and get a larger space so more people can enjoy this unpretentious yet totally awesome food. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hearty meal. If you‚Äôre looking for Amuse Bouche, however, go somewhere else!

I visited this outlet today with high hopes which came from my last visit to their New Alipore outlet. Let me summarise today's experience with a single line :
The Steak Factory Southern Avenue branch is a perfect destination for people who have been trying (unsuccessfully) long and hard to turn into veggies.
To give the devil it's due: the starters were pretty decent; meat balls and chicken wings in barbecue sauce.
The fiasco started when they told us that pork ribs were unavailable. (To me that's the best item on their menu, at least in the other branch)
Disappointed, we ordered safe: Ham steaks, mutton steaks and a beef steak.
The mutton steak tasted like glorified,overpriced mutton kormas. Out of the 2 ham steaks ordered initially, one was fine and half of the other one was rotten. Literally.
Then came the cherry on the cake; The Beef steak. Let me write a few points about it because it certainly deserves special mention:
1. I regret that beef isn't banned in Kolkata. Had it been so, we would not have had the horror of seeing that beef steak being served to us.
2. On 2nd thoughts, it may well be the product of a shrewd political move, whereby Kolkatans are so mortified of a beef steak that they would never even dream of ordering one ever again,hence bringing a virtual beef ban in Kolkata.
3. Hats off to the chef and the guy who served us the beef steak, braving its putrid,gut wrenching stench. I wonder how they pulled of the trick without vomiting all over the steak because all of us were about to, as soon as it was kept in front of us. I seriously have no clue how such a reputed franchise can serve a piece of rotten flesh and hope that we would eat it and pay for it. Seriously. Were you guys on dope?

The staff apologised(I could totally see the guy's face contorting when he smelled the steak) and replaced it with guess what: another half rotten ham steak. And by that time we have had enough.

They apologised yet again, offered to replace the steak yet again but we felt the "stakes" were too high: Our goddamn health vs rotten steaks (no pun intended).

They didn't include the steaks in the bill(obviously) and served us 2 complimentary desserts; but by that time most of us were feeling so pukish that we would have vomited all over the place had it not been for the Jimmy Hendrix pic on the wall. Smart move.

I finished my dinner at another restaurant.
It says a lot about a place when you say that their virgin mojito was the best thing you had for dinner.

I am against using pejoratives, but I badly want to use one this time. One thing is for certain: I'm never going back to the place and thank you guys for ruining a beef steak for me for the foreseeable future.
(Rating this a single star;since apparently according to Zomato no gastronomic experience/ordeal can be rated lower than that)

We went to this outlet tonight for dinner...as we are very familiar with the new alipore outlet we expected same or better service from this joint as it has higher rating than the new alipore one...but we're very disappointed üò£...we ordered Grilled tiger prawn and Shirley temple...the drink was as expected, but the prawn had a very bad smell that we could not eat...the ratatouille portion of the dish is good, but the main item, the prawn was smelling...we told them...they told that we can order any steak of our choice which they can serve promptly...we ordered California fish steak and it was served after 30 mins (prompt service!!!) üò¶...i'm not satisfied with the taste of the dish also...thought the ambience is good, this outlet is bigger than the new alipore one, but according to the quality of food it's not satisfactory üòîüòí...

I had been eyeing this restaurant for a while and got the chance to try it for lunch today.
The menu has a decent variety from salads, to pizza, to steaks (of course) and some starters.
We had a chicken steak, Cajun fish fry and a prawn salad. In terms of taste all the dishes were good, quantity could be better, presentation was nice as well. Service was good and prompt and cost was decent considering continental items. This place is worth the money.
The decor inside was pretty cool but they could add a fan to circulate the air considering the summer in Kolkata.
On an overall I think this place is worth a visit, I know I would return.

The ambience of the restaurant is like a typical pizza joint in Pondicherry with white windows of old days, houses and guest houses being seen through the windows. The seating arrangement too has a similarity with Pizza Hut in City Centre 1.
Coming to the food, the sizzlers and steaks are good enough but those who love a sip of beer or wine with these food will starve for it as bar is not available. Otherwise its a good place to hangout with friends.

This place opened with a lot of promise and at a time when good steaks were hard to find in the city. My first visit to the branch in New Alipore was delightful. We were a rather large group and ordered a variety of dishes, ranging from the subtle and very tasty Cream of Chicken soup to the classic wood fire pizzas. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the chef understood what we meant by medium steaks, most places serve you well done and argue that this is medium. They recently opened a new branch in Lake Place, off Southern Avenue but things have deteriorated and this is not a place I would recommend as the quality of most dishes has dropped phenomenally. Their signature wood fire pizzas are never available, home delivery not an option due to lack of staff and their steaks are a disappointment compared to the ones served when they first came onto the scene. The staff are courteous, however the food lacks the consistency one associates with places like these. Their air conditioning has been ineffective on our last two visits and their free Wi-Fi is definitely not a saving grace. Overall, this place has lost its initial goodwill due to various reasons and will need to make amends quickly to get back the regular customer.

Just returned from dinner here , a quaint little place , not that little also , the music was very soft and the ambience pleasing to the eyes , lots of famous pictures of Marilyn Monroe , Woody Allen , coming to the food aspect , we ordered the Barbecued Pork Ribs , we got three pieces of ribs , they had quite a bit of fat attached , though it was quite  tasty with the barbecue and red wine reduction, the ribs were adequately big owing to the fat , we were left wanting for more , the main course was the redeeming factor , the chicken cordon bleu was excellent as was the grilled chicken,the dessert was a let down ,I ordered for the chocolate souffl√© and what I got was a chocolate mousse which they called the souffl√© . Also chocolate sauce poured on top did not really help,maybe it was a bad day for the chefs, since this is the first time I've been there , all in all good food , a nice concept introduced in Kolkata , I would be going back for more and trying the other items on the menu . Definitely there is room for improvement .

We liked the food on our first visit. So we went back to taste more dishes. Pork Chop, BarBQue pork ribs, chicken wings are quite good. What disappointed us was the Spaghetti with Meatballs.¬† The sauce was not prepared inhouse. It had the distinct taste of past-n-pizza sauces readily available in the market. A restaurant that doesnt make its own sauce creates not a good impression. But the service is quick and quantity good.

To start. It's not a big restaurant, it can accommodate merely 20 people. 
Ambience - Pretty good actually. There is rock music playing on the background. The light is just apt for a steak house. 
Food -  well I ordered chicken steak for which it's famous along with hamburger. The steak was good, really good. The burger was actually better but it's harsh to compare two cuisines. 
Service - well, they should work on their services. I had to wait for 15-20 min before I get the food. You get free WiFi here too. 
The price is slightly on the higher side. 
To conclude, not somewhere a college student would go often but yeah saving up the cash for a meal here would be worth it.

Well, this was the very first time I had a steak in my life, and I seriously loved it.  The ambience is really nice, the people who were serving the food were really friendly, and specially the manager, I called her Didi as her name was not known to me, was very caring and friendly. Now, about the food, to be precise, I loved it. I would definitely visit this place, whenever I come to Ballygange.  As I am from Chandannagar, which is in the suburbs of Kolkata, there are not much places like this there. I would request the owners to open a branch there, if they can. Lastly, this place is a must visit for everyone, whoever comes to Ballygange.

Overall experience in not atall satisfactory. Firstly only one waiter was running around and he was taking order, generating bill and taking money. All in one. Then afet ordering I had to wait for 40 minutes to get the food. The mutton steak was too good buy we did the life time mistake by ordering chelow kebab. It was horrible. So if its only steak then the place is really good but as per me not for dinner.

Being a steak lover, this place was always in my wishlist. And finally i along with my friend went to this place a few months ago.
To start with the interior, the place was nice and decent. And i must mention that they played quality songs. I really liked their choice of music.
Now coming to the food quality, i have just one word to say : "DELICIOUS". The steaks were soft and juicy. I loved the texture of the food.
Though its definitely not a pocket friendly one but the money worth it.¬†
Looking forward to visit again !!!
P.S. - Highly recommended for steak lovers :)

Starting with the ambiance. It was great,the hanging lamp sheds and the Beatles' songs represented the retro style.
The food was extremely delicious.We ordered a chicken steak with mashed potatoes¬† and a factory mixed grill.The chicken stick also had an poach over it with slight gravy of the steak .It tasted magnificent with the garlic breads.The quantity was sufficient for one.The factory mixed grill contained chicken,mushrooms,lambs.All cooked in the same sauce with beans,corns and carrots.It was also very nice.May be they were promoting montecarlo-a dessert ,offered us for free.I have not¬† tasted such a dessert at least not in a restaurant,may be u'll get it in an icecream parlour.It was also very tasty and yummy.
Overwhelmed by the staff's behavior and service.On the whole its a great place to hang around ,if you are a meat lover
Awesome !!! --- The Steam Factory,Lake Place

Had dinner here yesterday with my boyfriend and the experience was just fantastic. We were planning to go to this place for quite some time and finally we went yesterday. We had ordered fried calamary for starters followed by tenderloin steak for me n mixed grill kebab steak ( forgot the name) for him, pork chops and a strawberry soufle. 
Both me n my boyfriend are big foodies so the taste matters a lot to both of us. And steak factory has passed with flying colours..! Everything there starting from the ambience of the place to the hospitality of the staffs to finally the food was just too good. The steak was melt-in-the-mouth yummy. The sauce in the pork chops was to die for but I felt the cut of the meat could have been better (more fat less meet) perhaps they can work on it..the dishes we ordered were very good..so much that we ended up ordering a fish item, which I m not able to remember the name of, even after ordering dessert. The fish was super soft cooked in a very subtle white sauce. Over all the dining experience was just perfect and I would recomend this place to everyone. Do visit for the steak cos if any of you have had a taste of Mocambo's steak then let me tell you something..this one is better than theirs! Cheers!

I have been going to the Steak House in New Alipore but decided that I wanted to try other one. Its such a warm cozy place and extremely comfortable. I ordered a tenderloin and it was just rightly done at warm pink wine. Amazing music, pleasant surprised when they played Alter Bridge and was tapping all through my course. Wonderful and courteous service and the lady at the desk was kind enough to make sure that we were enjoying our meal.
All in all its a 5 for me!
Thank you would be back soon :)

I have been a fan of steak factory ever since I have tasted the steaks at alipore. I would say steak factory is one of a kind. It is thoroughly amazing experience when their signature tenderloin steak just melts in your mouth and the rich taste persists for years to come. Since I am ardent fan of steaks and since a new outlet had popped out at southern avenue , I could not just wait to rush. And I finally did reach with one of my college buddies. On entering I got the same feeling of their alipore joint, only thing, that this was a bit more spacious. Without any further delay we set out. I wanted a tenderloin for my self and I just did not care. My friend was up for chicken that day, so he preferred to go in for the grilled chicken nepolitana. the service was a bit slow. But however, I felt , it was worth the wait. And my yumm steak arrives and I start hogging it. The same old taste which melts in the mouth.  I just wished thia went on and on. The neopolitan was quite amazing with the grilled chicken in neopolitan sauce. And this was the first time I tried out their desserts.  Chocolate monte carlo sounded amazing. So we just ordered for it. Amazing it is. A must try dessert . Pounding and bursting with chocolate,  Chocolate monte carlo is one of the better chocolate desserts of kolkata. And without the shadow of doubt, I am definitely going back. Cheese steak calling !!

Good place for stakes, reasonably priced. The restaurant is housed in one of those old buildings in Southern Avenue. The still haven't got liquor license. I wanted to order the pork ribs, which was not available. Also the choice of desserts were limited. I guess they work with limited resources, and they could not provide us quarter plates for all, but that's ok f you consider the food and the portion.

Went there for lunch on May Day after this place has been on my mind for quite sometime. The expectations were a little too steep I suppose reading mostly positive reviews.¬†Service : Prompt and Courteous.
Ambience : Comfortable Seating. Nice Music. The Posters on the walls are too small to actually create any major effect (have seen better). Now comes the sad part. They seated us in their inner room where the AC was not cooling and they had no fan. We were literally sweating having our food. Disappointing.
Food : We ordered 1.Chef's Salad, 2.Assorted Fries, 3.Chicken Wings, 4.Factory Mixed Grill, 5.Grilled Bhetki Sizzler, 6.BarBq Pork Ribs.The Chef's Salad was really nice. Quantity for all the dishes were quite satisfactory.
The Assorted Fries contained Potato Wedges, Onion Rings and French Fries. All were as they generally are. The Mayo dip was little in quantity.
The Chicken Wings were disappointing. Served cold and smeared with a very sour sauce of unknown origin
The Grilled Bhetki Sizzler and the Factory Mixed Grill (did not personally try), both were good.
The Bar-b-Que Pork Ribs was the greatest goof up. Beyond Disappointing so to say. Ribs used contained excess fat. I honestly don't think it was put on a BarbQue at all, seemed Microwaved and again smeared in the sour sauce. Horrible.

I visited steak factory southern avenue for dinner... ambience is nice... tastefully set up not very big but tables are placed at considerable distance... for appetizers we had bacon wrapped prawns.. the dish looked a bit clumsy and they were on the saltier side but the after taste makes you want more...comes with a nice dressing and a tasty dip... satisfying portions with 6 pieces on a plate... we also ordered fried calamari which was a bit disappointing as the portion was too less about 18 rings very small and the squid was a little stinky...after chilli's is quite below standard... but the main course made up for all the mess up... fabulous pork ribs...meat falling of the bone comes with a beautiful bbq sauce dressing...boiled veggies and french fries on the side...very very satisfying portion and extremely tasty...the cheesy steak (beef) was well done and perfectly seasoned and also came with a nice sauce... all in all a good assortment on the menu...has something for everyone and most importantly quite reasonably priced...

Im a big fan of steaks, so this place anyway gets a 3/5. We ordered chicken steak.. we liked it so much that we ordered another one.  The steak was soft , juicy. Only I wish that the egg poach served with the steak is a little less fried. In all a good experience.  The service is a bit on the slower side though,  but that's fine as long as they serve steaks... 

Will I go back?? Definitely....

This is one of the best places for meat lovers. Let me start by saying that the food was stupendous and the two of us ate like gluttons. We started of with Tenderloin steak (beef steak) .. This was super delicious. Then came blackened fish, which tastes similar to bhetki in lemon butter sauce. The fish was very soft and fresh .. I personally being a fish lover, gorged on this dish. Then we had the Prosciutto stuffed chicken with creamy mushroom sauce. This was best dish of all. This had a piece of ham and chicken with spinach grilled together in creamy mushroom sauce. This looked gastronomically enticing and tasted out of this world. If you are here, do not miss this. Finally we had the Garlic tiger prawn the was quite palatable too. Undoubtedly the food is a must try. The staff can be a little courteous, and they maybe a little suggestive about the food. This will definitely increase customer satisfaction. The ambience is good. Everything looks clean and fresh. I will definitely go back to steak factory again.

Located on the lane after crossing Menoka, this is a tough place to find for people not acquainted with Southern Avenue interiors. Anyhow we reached there around 2:30 PM and found it to be cute and cozy with not much crowd which I expected on a warm Sunday afternoon. Coming to the food :

1. Chef Salad: Very very average to say the least. Being a hardcore European food lover, it is nowhere compared to the salad that I have had in places like Q33, where I felt, to have salad as the main course

2. Hamburger: Average. Though the pork was nicely cooked and very soft, yet I got a feeling that it was not fresh and the ones used are the processed ones in which loads of preservatives are added.¬†

3. When you visit Steak Factory, leaving without a chicken steak is a crime. Although I hoped I had committed it. It was horrible to say the least. The chicken was hard as a rock, the gravy was absolutely tasteless, the garnishing was minimal to say the least, the preparation was something which I wondered could be made at home.

I had very high expectations, specially I really like joints like these. I would say even Wise Owl, Edesia, Corner Courtyard are 100 times better than this. Its an over-hyped joint and I really have doubts over me visiting again. Rating of two is because of the coziness of the place and the promptness of service.

Great steaks and ambiance. The only reason I am giving a 4 rating is for the sitting placement is a bit clumsy. The waiters and managers are very well behaved and helps with good suggestions. I would visit again to try the rest of the steaks. Tried the seafood steak and the mixed grill. The seafood one got higher marks. Cheers

Love this place...If you have a meat craving, this would be an ideal place for you... Also, in years to come this can very well replace the Peter Cats and the Mocambos... Ambience is perfect with light western music in the background and serene decour...The most important part- the food is awesome to say the least. The steak will melt in your mouth and the sizzler- ahh...what do I say to justify it. Service is very prompt and you will always be greeted with a smile.

Being a foodie I crave meat, and a place dedicated entirely to meat is a fantasy. April shower relieving the hot summer day was just perfect for my date with food.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†So when I was at the door the first thing that caught my attention was the 'Free WiFi' sign which made my heart jump with joy. The decor with the red brick walls, Woody Allen and Classic movie posters and wooden finished chairs and tables enthralled me.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†John Denver, Beatles, The Who, Guns and Roses set the perfect atmosphere for a good steak dinner. On ordering a Chicken and Cheese Steak, a Chef's Salad and Fish Carnival I was more than satisfied with the quality of food. The Fish Carnival instigated a gastronomic carnival inside my tummy. The price is reasonable and affordable for college goers like us as well. Only thing is that I would have preferred a pint of beer to wash down my steak but no worries. Overall it was an amazing experience.

A rainy day, hotel California on d loop and steak - perfect setting for The steak factory !
Ambience- location can b a bit tricky but enter and u hear gud music and see beautifully decorated walls .. Suddenly gives u a motel-ish vibe..
Highlights-there trademark chicken steak- they'll make u wait for it but its worth d wait.. Delight for pork lovers whu can feast upon d pork sizzler infused in barbeque sauce(foodgasm) .. Caramel custard is heavenly..
Letdowns- the Chelo kabab not upto standards.. Especially if u hv tasted peter cat's it'll not meet ur standards... Service is a major disappointment (they wont greet you, unpleasent and uncordial and it took them 10 mins to give us the menu). Though the food do comes in time.
Overall- steak lovers paradise.... Minor glitches doesn overpower d amazing steaks. My only wish - "if they had beer.. Period"

Finally went to The Steak Factory (Southern Avenue outlet) on a rain-washed evening. The first thing that strikes you is its cosy ambience and interesting decor. The walls have some fine pictures of famous Hollywood classics and celebs. Coming to the food, we had Chicken Quesedilla in the starter. It was delicious and the chicken had a light smoky flavour. Next was the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Very cheesy with vegetables and french fries. Quite yummy! Lastly the much awaited Chicken Steak with vegetables and french fries. For me the chicken was slightly tough and too salty. Overall a pleasant experience specially the nice songs being played in the background. Service is also very satisfactory!

I believe American food is a lot more personal in nature. I would have appreciated a lot, had the server spent a little more time understanding my expectations, so that he could serve me better. I went at a time when there was no crowd so he could afford more time with us. 
I loved the food, and my advice is that one should go at the crowded moment and have burgers etc to enjoy and be happy to be served. This isn't a fine dining place, so trim your expectations. 
I loved the lamb lasagna and the prosciutto stuffed chicken with mushroom sauce. Both are easy to put on plate, and taste awesome. Also asked for quesadilla, which could have more veggie filling and original chicken filling instead of chicken salami slices. 
American food is easy food which should have authentic ingredients.

I went to this place on Friday evening around 7.. It was not much crowded but started getting filled up with time. 
Beginning with the decor.. The entrance stairs were wooden finish and the interior was quite nice with the movie frames and wooden floor and basic chairs.
Coming to the starters we ordered chef salad which was awesome.. Loved the idea of using salami instead of chicken chunks. Chilled and dressing was just sufficient. We also ordered quesadilla.. Look wise was nothing appealing and taste wise also ok!! 
Then the main course: 
Lamb lasagne was nice but quite spicy
Bhetki sizzler the best food of the evening but quite was too less
Prosciutto stuffed chicken Was awesome.. The creamy mushroom sauce was just perfect.a must try...
And then finishing it off with caramel custard
Too authentic and nice!!!
Staffs were nice.. But if u suggest something they are not ready to listen..

I am an ardent steak lover and was very excited when my cousins and I planned for an outing at The Steak Factory in Southern Avenue. The decor of the place is simple and has an European aura to it. The staff was friendly. We ordered Bacon Wrapped Prawns which we found to be a bit raw. We couldn't have it. The other dishes like Spaghetti Carbonara and meatballs was delicious! We ordered beef steak well done and a mixed sizzler which were also sumptuous. The dessert was good too. Over all, it was a nice experience, though a bit costly. I found it okay for a one time experience and would rather try new restaurants that going back. There are a lot of other places which have near perfect food and are more pocket friendly.

The forte of this restaurant is food. Located in a quiet, unassuming, leafy street near the Menoka movie theatre, this restaurant occupies half the ground floor of a residential building. They have done no changes to the exterior of the building. Which some might find charming, but for me, a steak house in a quiet residential street needs a little dressing up. The interiors are simple and nice. Old hollywood posters donning the walls giving it a somewhat Western ambience, as it should.
It is advisable to book your tables well in advance as the restaurant is not very big and is quite popular in South Kolkata.¬†
Among the starters the bacon wrapped prawns was nice. I think it is very difficult to go wrong with bacons and prawns together in one dish. Shrimp cocktail, Calamari was decent.
In the main course, and here lies the strength of the restaurant, the tenderloin steak is one of the best in the city. I asked for a medium cooked steak. It was perfect. Didn‚Äôt like the sauce much.
The desserts are good too. Especially the chocolate souffle was nice.
The restaurant is a little understaffed but.¬†
But there is only one necessary improvement that this steak house needs. They must add alcohol to their menu. Only after a pint of beer or a glass of scotch can one fully appreciate the excellent steaks that are served here.
Overall one of the best place for steaks in the city.

Been here before this and today again enjoyed the bacon wrapped prawns, I love the way they use pepper in their dishes, not everyone can get that right. Had the chicken steak which was served a bit late but was worth the wait. It was really tasty, I couldn't stop trying to scoop every drop of the sauce left on the plate. And the cream of chicken soup was just the way I like it.  Though I don't have anything to complain about was disappointed that they couldn't serve the Shirley temple. Overall I would go here on a regular basis. Price worth it.

This time, had a family dinner their. Loved the ambiance of the joint, though the allocated space is not much big, they have managed to furnish and decorate it beautifully. One liners, vintage movie and album posters made the ambiance more like an European eating joint.

Coming to the food, we ordered nachos and Russian salad for starters. Nachos were okayish type but loved the salad. As we were six is numbers, we ordered six different types of steaks which included Californian Fish fillet, Ham, Chicken, Tenderloin and Lamb. Though I really loved the Lamb, Ham and Fish steak, the chicken and beef steak was not that marvelous. I really felt the quantity of meat in chicken platter was less if I consider the return on value where as it would be better if beef was little more cooked, though I instructed the server to cook the tenderloin as medium. It all ended well with a sweet taste of chocolate souffle. 
As from service perspective, everything was quite good, though they could have been a little more proactive in helping us to choose a dish. 
All in all, had a nice experience there and I was real happy that I drove my family in Steak Factory on a beautiful Saturday evening.

After hearing a lot of great reviews about this place,last Saturday I finally let Google maps take me to this small American diner-themed restaurant on Southern Avenue. The decor is typically that of a diner with the menus coming in wooden frames. 

We (my friend and I) ordered Chicken Quesadilla,Factory Mixed Grill,Factory Grilled Fish,Chocolate Brownie with Ice-Cream, Chocolate Souffle and two Virgin Mojitos.

All the dishes were superb but I would have preferred a bit more salsa on the Quesadilla and a little less sour cream on the grilled fish. 

A great first experience and will be visiting again soon.

Hygiene and service both at their lowest. And the icing on the cake was intolerably dirty toilets...!! Totally unexpectable... Time the owner takes a round of the place..

A great place for a Family eating outing. Staff are very courteous and friendly. Food is very nice in taste and presentation. Pinch on the pocket is moderate. 03 People with mocktails, prawn starters, main course and sweet dish around 2.5K. Ambiance is very nice and good music, my style.

What we liked best about the joint are the courteous staff and good Continental Food.

The portions of the main course was a bit less, although that is actually not a negative.

They are good. But need to improvise the presentation. Especially how they serve dessert. No plates under a dessert bowl is a BIG mistake... That too when the content can spill over. Can earn that extra .5 with a little care in the presentation front.

Lot was at stake when I they messed up the quesadilla...but here's how they managed to earn the rating.

Pros:
1. Great ambience, good themed setting...nice n clean presentation of the west; sensible choice of music
2. Menu offers a lot to drool over
3. Warm friendly waiting on the tables
4. Lastly and most importantly... If good food is like music to your mouth, I must it was well orchestrated

Cons:
1. Waiters are friendly but they need to be more lively...cause that's how it is in the west
2. Turn around time needs to improve
3. Ordered chicken quesadilla for a starter - it took them more than 30mins to come back and say they cant serve cause the they burnt it

Good part is they didn't serve the burnt food. Rather they owned up the mistake. And in the end, to make the great Chocolate Montecarlo better, they put it on the house!! Nice gesture. Loved it.

So if you ask me, yes I'm one of their happy steakholders today!

Tucked in a quite little alley near Southern Avenue is this gem of a steakhouse. Having been utterly disappointed by the quality of steak in Chilli's, I was cautious at first about trying this place out. But once I entered I could say this would be good. Was it? Let's find out.
The thing we ordered first was Cocktail Sausages, which were good but nothing to jump about. Then came the two mains we ordered, Tenderloin Steak and Pot Roasted Mutton. The mutton was awesome with just the right amount of seasoning and really juicy tender pieces. And the buttered rice that came with it was out of this world.
Coming to the steak, I requested medium-rare and was given just that. A hunky piece of juicy tenderloin with immaculate seasoning and pink centre. The silky smooth potato mash and thick gravy made the dish aquire a whole new level of awesomeness.
Coming to the desserts, the Caramel Custard was yummy with just the right amount of jiggle. But was disappointed with the Chocolate Monte Carlo as it was nothing more than a chunk of chocolate ice cream over a piece of Brownie.
Lastly, the bill was also not that heavy on the pocket. Definitely going back!

Well, I am a huge lover of steak,and I've visited this place more than 5 times, and it has never let me down. Starting from Factory mixed grill, to Chicken ala kiev, chicken steak, beef steak, every damn dish is equally amazing. This is my current favourite place for having steaks, specially I go mad over the Chicken cheese steak. And, one more thing about this place is its ambience, the classy music is an add-on to it. Do visit this place! :)

Well this was my first visit to the place, its a quaint little place nicely done up. There food is decent but when it comes to the seafood platter the quantity is not enough compared to the price. They really serve delicious Chicken Quesadilla. We had also ordered four main courses- Chicken Steak which was a bit undercooked,Pot roasted Mutton which was amazing and had a yummy gravy,Factory Mixed Grill which was really good ¬†, the spoiler was the Grilled Tiger Prawns which was average and the quantity was too less.The deserts at this place too is a disappointment. As for the staff they seemed lackadaisical and disinterested , so until they really pep up their service and the seafood dishes I would not visit this place again.

My craving for some good food ended yesterday with a visit to the Steak Factory. It's situated in a quaint South Kolkata neighbourhood (Near the Shib Mandir Pujo) to be precise. It can be a bit tough to locate so google for directions! ¬†The restaurant is neatly done up which looked like a ground floor apartment. The decor is simple and dim lights are extremely soothing!¬†

Since we were at a friend's place for a few drinks I decided to order our dinner over phone (since we were in a hurry and it was closing time) which comprised of Lamb Lasagna and Grilled Bhetki Sizzler. We reached around 10:20pm and the was offered a seat instantly. I was quite surprised to see the restaurant 60% full even on a weekday.¬†

The food arrived within 10 minutes. The steak was simply brilliant and the fish was extremely fresh. The lamb lasagne was good too with minced mutton baked with cheese. It was mildly spicy if I may call it. We had also ordered garlic bread with our meal. The staff were more than courteous and I thought it was extremely sweet of them to take the order over the phone. Certainly a must visit place for good continental food!

I don't write reviews much but for this i feel like i have to do this.Recently my brother and me visited this place. The ambiance was okay. We ordered Tenderloin Steak and Mutton Steak. The Mutton Steak was basically nothing but a Mutton CHOP, not a Steak. So if anyone wants to eat steak then do not order this. Even they wrote this as Mutton CHOP in the bill. Tenderloin Steak was okay, not so tender.Feels like a bit pricey for the amount of steak and chop we got.

You have to take an effort to find this place if you have no clue about the lanes of southern avenue but the find nis worth it.
Chicken quesidilla as a starter did set our mood to have more food . We got a good news when we went to order the main course. It wad happy hours and we get a main course free if we order 3 main course or we get a dessert free of we order 2main course. So we ordered pot mutton, mixed grill, king prawns and checken steak. The mutton were undercooked,  and the prwan dish had only 4prawn rest veggies, we were disappointed only in this two issues . Rest the food was awesoem and enjoyable. 
If you are in no mood of ordering dessert after all this you can easily skip it. We had ordered caramel custard and chocolated souffle believe me they were not very special but not bad either.

Steak Factory.. Visited this place sometime back.. A very homely looking place from the outside and a very stylish place from the inside. A very wide range of continental and american dishes, of course we ordered d steak here,which was really very tasty. Sizzler was great too,one of the best i've had till date. The staff were very cooperative and patiently described us the items as we were not ao familiar with many names. The dessert palette was good too.. Overall,though the price is a lill bit on the higher side,but i would like to go back to this place,because i really loved it. P.S.- you really get good speed Wi-Fi for free.

Its a little diffecult to find this place because it is secluded from the main road, but once you do find it, u'll realy have nothing to complain. Friendly service, great food, and awsome ambience. I went with my friend and who always talks about how awsom this place is. We ordered the chicken wings from the starter section. It was just perfect, i never had anything like that before.
In the main cource i ordered the smoked chicken and mushroom resorto and my friend ordered the chelow kabbab. We had to wait for nearly 30mins which was a little anoying, but once the food was served everything was good again. The amount was great and the quality even greater. We also got the desert, chocolate browny with vannila ice cream, it was one of the best deserts i have ever had.

Service was nice, a little delayed, but other wise good, the people were good too. I will go back to this place again and will try something new.

Great place..... Food was very good..... ¬† ¬†though his place can get a little difficult to locate and that's why I'm giving half star less. We had chicken nuggets, beef tenderloin steak and smoked chicken mushroom risotto. All the dishes was very good. Though one problem I found that I ordered Medium rare, but it was more medium than rare. I would suggest to order rare. Place is nice and cozy. Prices are also reasonable looking at the portion sizes. Cost for two is 800. I would love to visit soon.

This place is quite inside so finding this place is quite problematic. Though the food was good and reasonable. We ordered Swiss salad which was testy but I can make it at home ? then ordered a sizzler which was ok coz the barbecue sauce was in excess. Then we had spaghetti bolognese which personally I didn't like otherwise over all it was good if u compare with price.

This place can get a little difficult to locate! So one should call them up before going. The steak was ok enough. But this place has a loooong way to go before it can give park street steaks a run for their money. I guess that explained the absence of customers when I went in around evening. Can't tell you much about the food because honestly you don't take back much home with you after eating here

Have heard a lot about this place from a long time and finally tried yesterday at their Southern Avenue outlet. 
To begin with, the inside decor was pretty amazing and so was the staff courtesy. 
We ordered for Virgin Pina Colada, orange mocktail, California fish fillet steak and tenderloin (beef) steak. The coolers were good as is with most of the other joints, but what amazes us were the steaks. I have been to many other restaurants and tried their steaks but the steaks they serve simply tops the list. 
The California fish fillet steak was soft and juicy and at par with some of the best steaks I had when abroad. And regarding the beef steak, that was equally exceptional. I would surely come back to try their other items.

Awesome place... Like the second time I went there. The meats they serve are the best I've tasted in Kolkata. Can improve on the drinks list, avoid the sizzlers as you'd fill up on veggies and rice. Go for just the steak variations. The sauces that accompany are well made and the delivery is in record timings.

The first thing that i am going to mention about Steak Factory is not its food but its interior. It is a very chic little restaurant with framed photos of audrey hepburn and the movie, gone with the wind amongst other photos. We tried the ham steak and a kabab platter which were both delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, being a big fan of steaks myself. The service was also very good. What i did not like was the souffle ( both chocolate and strawberry). It had a grainy texture and was too sweet. But if you drop the idea of having the dessert then Steak Factory is surely the place to be. Enjoy!

Google Maps-The savior! Its difficult to locate this joint at first but its just a few blocks away from Menoka cinema hall.
Best part- Its so much bigger than the New Alipore outlet. Its bright and cozy and as we sat at a table with the wall having the Breakfast at Tiffany's and Manhattan posters we were handed the menu.¬†
Having tried the steaks numerous times at the New Alipore outlet and since we wanted something light, we settled for Mac n Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu and Fresh Lime Soda.¬†
Within 10mins we were served with the Mac n Cheese in a small sized bowl. It was full of yum cheese, gooey and the macaroni was really tasty.¬†
Then came the Cordon Bleu, which had cheesy parsley sauce on top, veggies and fries. The chicken was crusted and grilled and stuffed with ham. The cheesy sauce was just delicious and the chicken was crisp and nice. The Lime soda perfect with super fizz and lemon.
¬† And since we are never too full for dessert we took Brownie with icecream and hot chocolate sauce. Yes I confess to be a Brownie-addict and having had brownies from many places ever since, this Brownie was one of the best brownies I have ever had. They provided the Icecream in a separate cup and that's one wise thing to do because the Brownie is so good that you dont even want the icecream but yeah the icecream was nice too. The brownie was hot as if just out of the oven, with heavenly aroma and out of the world taste! And the whole bill with tax and service tax came to be 781. Pretty kool, eh?
I am visiting again again and again !! <3

I being a huge fan of steaks was excited to find this place near my home. It was a sudden unplanned visit to this place which turned out to be a pleasant one. the outlet offers free wi fi for the customers with a cozy decor. Food was satisfactory but wish the quantity was little more keeping the price factor in mind. The location is bit confusing but thanks to the locals who helped me to trace it
 Overall a good experience...would visit again!

This is a warm and cozy nook, where you can have done amazing steaks, with your loved ones. The ambiance is good, has a warn and inviting feel. We ordered a chicken steak, chicken tandoori, and a fries platter. The steak was Nicely done, and was succulent and flavorful. The sides chicken tandoori was passable, but the buttered rice they served with it, was so damn amazing! The fries platter had pakode like potato wedges, which was weird and different for me .The only disappointment was the washroom, which was sub standard.

Steak Factory at Southern Avenue is located very close to my place, hence the decision to drop in one fine evening with my family..I have never been to their New Alipore outlet, so this was my first visit to the Factory!.. First up, we ordered couple of mocktails, Shirley Temple and Virgin Mohito.. while ¬†the Mohito was pretty good, the Shirley Temple was not really refreshing..I was craving fish n chips that day, so decided to start with that.. Disappointingly, while the fish was fried well, the quality of fish was not up to the standard. It did not smell too well. Fish n Chips, though a standard recipe, can be quite tricky to pull off at times, and this was proof in front of me. However, we shrugged off the blues and decided to order a Bolognese Pizza. We were told it would take them 20-25 mins to serve the pizza and so we waited.. the pizza, I am happy to report, was beyond our expectations. The minced meat was cooked to perfection, and the amount of spices in it was just right. The thin crust pizza was nicely baked as well. Consisting of four huge slices, the quantity was good for the price (Rs 290).. Our total bill came to Rs 880, which was quite reasonable. Gosh, I could have paid 500 bucks only for the pizza alone I was that overwhelmed! So do try that out, even though pizzas would probably be the last on anyone's wishlist in a place named Steak Factory. I would visit again just to taste the other pizzas on their menu.

I am a hugeeee steak lover and this place is just heaven for me! That's all i can say about this place. Continental so good I hardly found anywhere in kolkata. They make the best. Grilled Chicken, Blackened Fish, Sizzelers, Stuffed Tandoori Chicken Legs, Factory Mixed Grilled Fish are some of the best dishes out here. Service is very nice. I say too good. Ambience gives u a added flavour to your steaks ? Everything else is very nice. Overall you gonna have a good experience out here. And special mention; prices are too cheap. Hola steak factory guys, if u are reading this please dont hike the prices ? i always have a nice experience whenever I visit here.

After hearing a lot about this place from my peers and also from zomato i decided to give it a try...

I.went there for lunch on a friday afternoon...locating this place was a bit tough...
But once you go in you will feel like you r in an american cafe or bistro...the decor is unique and attractive...
Now coming to the food we ordered chicken macaroni salad and garlic bread for starters...both tasted good and the service was quick as well...
For main course we had chicken steak...the chicken was a little rubbery...but otherwise tasted good...
Would like to visit this place again and hope they make the chicken steak a bit tender next time...

This outlet is very close to the Menoka cinema hall. This has been another restaurant I have wanted to visit for a while. And am happy to say we loved it. We went during happy hours so we got our dessert free. We had the Non-veg Irish Broth, Garlic Bread, Factory Mixed Grill, Pulled Pork Burger and Caramel Custard. The ambience is warm and welcoming. The staff was very courteous. And the food was equally delicious. I loved the brown sauce in the mixed grill. The soup was perfect with the garlic bread which was pretty yum too(I know it's garlic bread but, there's an art to it too guys).¬† I would love to have that Irish broth on chilly winter days.

With warm and cozy interiors and walls done in shades of red, wooden american style seating, well informed and behaved staffs, and delicasies with affordable pricing, The Steak Factory, tucked in a corner of lake place was just hit among our group of 7 pals.My FISH CARNIVAL, baked fillet on bed of red sauce spaghetti was done very well, while my friend raved of her FACTORY GRILED FISH!! CHELO KEBAB, FACTORY MIXED GRILL (with kakori kebabs and sausages), FACTORY MIXED GRILL SIZZLER and TENDERLOIN STEAK were pretty good too, While CHICKEN TETRAZZINI can be way improved. But what dissapointed us was the dessert, BROWNIE WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE.. The brownie was a sort of plain chocolate cake with raisins( strangely different) and hardly there was some chocolate sauce with it :(
With two portions of GARLIC BREAD, The billing was somewhere around 3000 which was really reasonable... overall a satisfactory experience :)

The location of the restaurant was made easy by zomato. I ordered pork ribs steak and factory special grill.. The ribs were nice but a little sour.. The management was very good and very friendly.. It's a place definitely I will visit again with friends.. The factory special was better than the steak to my tongue.. The price was reasonable and service was quick.. The music and the atmosphere is also good..

Another visit to this restaurant.  Food was good as usual but pork wasn't available.. The starter sausage was good .. Factory special grill was good as usual .  the dessert was management choice and it was mind blowing. Definitely visiting again.

Absolutely stunning beef steak. Perfect caramelization on the outside, pink and juicy inside. Can be had on its own, but the sauce was delish. The calamari was crisp and fresh. The stuffed mushroom was decent too. The pork chops are good. Portions are exactly right. Service is slow but the staff are warm and knowledgeable. Desserts are not that great. Brownie points for great music. Best place for steaks in Calcutta right now.

This place has great food, superb ambience and just the perfect service. Its one of my favourite restaurants. The steaks and sizzlers of this place are simply mind-blowing. And for the "Poisson" part of their menu i would like to say that I simply die for that kinda poisson. Whenever i am not in Kolkata i miss this place a lot. The only problem is it is little hard to locate this place. But if someone can take that little pain of locating the place I can assure you that you would love it.

P.S. All the "Joeys" ¬†around would fall in love with this place.

The steak factory is quite a recent name which has aquired a decent position in the choices of restaurants for the city food lovers. As steak is my altime favourite i went to this place wd great hope and it perfectly satiated my expectation. Firstly to those who finds it difficult to locate..take the lane beside Mehta House and walk straight, dont stop untill u find this place on your right. Coming to food, we skipped the starters and hovered over the main course in which we ordered a ham steak and a factory mixed grill. The ham steak was a big fat yet tender piece of pork meat in a brown sauce topped with a pineapple served with mashed potato. The mixed grill had chicken, lamb, mushroom and capsicum in a lighter brown gravy served with french fries and vegetables. Both were awesome to taste. Ice tea was refreshing There was an offer of one dessert free with two main course and we opted for brownie with icecream and chocolate sauce. The brownie was good to taste but was expected to be more tender and a bit less sweet. The sitting arrangement is casual dining. In an all, the dining experience was great. I would llove to visit this place again!

2016 review:
Happened to be back in Kolkata for another wedding trip. Luckily managed to grab our old guesthouse rooms right in front of this restaurant. Surely had to drop by. The moment we strolled into my favorite ACDC tracks and cult movie/music posters, i knew what i had missed all this while. To top it, this time our family had alligators running in our stomachs out of batshit crazy hunger..and boy did we order crazy..
To begin with minestrone soup and tomato soup with garlic bread. Easily one of the best minestrone soups I've had anywhere. Next came the main courses.
The grilled chicken risotto with mushrooms - wat a splendid dish! Most definitely my top 3 fav risotto preparations all time. The chicken was so soft n juicy and the rice sauce was perfectly tanged up with a combo of green rice. The Penne Pasta in red sauce was also equally well cooked with the right italian spices. The evg stroganoff scored well with its butter rice n creamy touch of gravy with a generous blend of bell peppers n capsis. And then came the winner of them all - The Fish Fillet Steak. The superstar dish of the afternoon, never before have I had a fish steak so deliciously awesome ...meat that melts in your mouth and grilled to absolute perfection. Our visit this time warrants a 5/5 :-)
(P.S. Loved the new Inglorious bastards and Django Unchained posters )

2015 review:
Reached here at 10.45pm...the resto was courteous and adjusting enough to make the chef wait and take our order.
The soups were brilliant...garlic breads were crunchy...service was quick.
Recommended dishes:
Chicken stroganoff, Steaks...variety of options.
Perfect rating of 4.5

After reading many good reviews,I finally visited this place yesterday. 4.2 guys!!!

We reached there at 9.30pm and was pretty impressed by the simple chic decor and the music.But the food disappointed us big time.We ordered crispy Calamari,ham burger,pork ribs,a coffee and a Shirley Temple. 10.15 came our coffee....yes just that! We were super hungry and the waiter kept consoling us. After ten more minutes we got the calamari - very basic average. 10.35 just the burger! The patty was too peppery for my taste buds.However,that still wasn't disaster.When the pork ribs finally got served,my partner couldn't put his knife through it!! We had to returns it and after sometime the waiter came and apologized and requested us to order something else instead.All the guests had left by then and we had to settle for anything available.We were served a pulled pork sizzler and it tasted alright, very little portion of over cooked fries and vegies but the meat tasted good.The portion wasn't good at all.We left the place paying for what we didn't want to order,nothing complimentary and we were so late!! Over all outrageous and disastrous...

P.S-the Shirley temple wasn't worth the mention.

A Small Joint in the quiet but lovely neighbourhood of the lake area with adequate car parking place, this place is sure to excite your taste buds. My wife and i went there one sat night and were pleasantly delighted to a Bhetki Carnival in pasta and Chicken Steak along with a complementary Blue Lagoon and to be honest i found the tastes better than even some of the more famous Park Street Restaurants. A must try for steak lovers.

The place is slightly obscured as it was difficult to locate but not so difficult after all. 
Coming to the place- it gives you a comfy small motel cum diner feeling- the american style. It's actually a repurposed old house nicely done.
Food wise I was quite pleased but I felt there's room for improvemet. Ordered the onion rings which were tasty but on the oily side, perhaps they did not make it a point to soak off the extra oil with paper towels or something... The steak was well prepared and had flavours even on the inside which is why I liked the place- well done! 
Overall nice place, would go again to try the other interesting things on the menu. 
A suggestion for the folks at the resto- please make the mashed potato better next time and also be a lil more generous with it. Cheers!

The place deserves a high rating for the genre of food they are offering. Taste and quality has a lot of scope for improvement. The ambiance is pretty casual and laid back. The music was good and the staff very courteous. 
Although the menu appears extensive at first look, it is actually very one dimensional and limited. Also, the day I visited they didn't seem to have a lot of things on the menu. The fish preparations are below expectations. The chicken was very good. Starters were very poor. One of my friends had ordered mutton/ lamb which was not steamed to his liking. The staff were helpful enough to steam it again for him to his satisfaction. Desserts again were very limited.
Overall, the place seemed to impress only in spurts. With a little more energy and effort I am sure the place could dazzle.

A hectic day in store....so thought better to start with a good lunch....visited Steak Factory in Southern Avenue ( near lake avenue).....I get nostalgic whenever I visit this place coz I have spent 8 years here during my college and CA days.

I didn't find the food to be great...don't ever go for Dahi Kabab u will be ruined for ever :) atleast I was...paying 220 rs for a freaking besan thing....I cudnt eat it...

Ambience was good music was soothing not too loud but yes other than that food sucks...

Me & my husband were looking to dine at a new place  somewhere near Southern Avenue & we sought help from Zomato. The steak factory came up & we decided to give it a try. Its located in quiet corner of the street. Decor & music is great. We ordered their chicken cream soup.& some mushroom starters. For the main course we ordered a chicken bacon pasta in white sauce & pork steak. All were good. I would definitely come back & try some other stuff.

I am a huge steak fan and when I found this place on zomato I was too eager to order for a home delivery (having a 6 month kid at home does restrict your eating out). However I was moved around between two outlets like a shuttle cock only to realise that they will not do home delivery. I tried three times over the next two weeks only to be greeted rudely with the same answer. My humble request is to remove the home delivery tag from this page and let us not fool people, needless to say the rude behaviour of the person attending the call.

I have reviewed the Alipore outlet previously and there's nothing more to add on the food quality. Having tried steaks and bbq chops in Europe, I hardly find any restaurant satisfying my longing for that European touch. This joint comes the closest on the Beef Steaks.
However, the service is extremely disappointing and sloths would have done a better job anyday !

Once you get inside, its a nice small restaurant giving a feel of the food joints one often sees in the Hollywood movies...it was lunch time and they were running a offer of 3+1 on main courses...we ordered chicken steak, ham steak, pork ribs and fish and chips...the pork and ham were tender, tested very good and presented well. The chicken was little over cooked and felt little rubbery, it was a little bland as well. The fish and chips was a disaster... The fish was under cooked and too expensive for the quality... Overall a little pinch in the pocket... Won't mind visiting again though....

I have been looking for a great place to have some amazing steak in Kolkata for quite some time.
The Steak Factory popped up on Zomato and I read almost all the reviews for this place and finally decided to try it myself.
The location to this place is a bit tricky.
I could reach almost near it but then had to ask for directions.
It is a small, warm and comfortable. It is one of those places where you can go, enjoy the retro theme, sit back, relax and order food.
We started with the Shrimp Cocktail which was good. The Shrimps were fresh and juicy.
We also ordered Chicken Steak and Fish Sizzler. The Fish Sizzler came with risotto. The sauce on the sizzler was really good.
The Chicken Sizzler came with fries and some baked veggies. Both of these were in generous amount.
For drinks we ordered a Lemon Iced Tea and a Virgin Pinacolada.
The pinacolda can be avoided but the iced tea will refresh you.
The Steak Factory has free WiFi, quite necessary for today's youth :)
One thing that they can improve up on is the service. It crawls at a snail's pace. We waited for almost 25-30 minutes before the first order was out.
Would definitely go back to try the rest of the steak and sizzlers.
Cheers!

Retro Hollywood decor welcomes you to this small restaurant whose delicious food speaks large. we ordered barbecue pork ribs (fantastic), factory mixed grill, lamb ragout, pot roasted mutton, smoked chicken and mushroom risotto, chocolate monte carlo and chocolate souffle. the dishes were good and well decorated on the plate. the gnochhi in the ragout could have been better. also the sauces could have a more unique distinctive taste. overall good music, good food and good ambiance makes this a definite second try on my list.

Words are not at all enough for me to describe this place. i always wanted to try out this place but to get a chance to do so on valentine's day was a dream. i heard about this place from a friend and then checked it out online to see the menu and all, but when i saw the menu i was so impressed that i even made up my mind as to what to order once a i were to go there. but when i first entered the place everything changed. the interior was the first thing that hit me and by lord it was just beautiful from the seating arrangements to the brick designed walls and the everything was just perfect and the beauty of the place was amplified by the small little heart shaped balloons floating all around. then comes the ambience of the place which is unlike anything i had seen before. you get a feel of that American diner which is alien to the city with the best songs running in the background from rock to country songs ranging from Poets of the Fall to John Denver and many more. given the name of the place is Steak Factory so it was a no brainer that we ordered a steak but was that all? no way cause we just couldn't resist the Chicken Macaroni Salad and Mixed Sizzler which proved to be just 'DELICIOUS'. so having covered everything i have to compliment the staff for their dedicated service and my heartiest thanks to them for giving us a place like STEAK FACTORY, my only regret is that i forgot to take pictures of the food to give you an idea but i guess i was enjoying my food way too much to think about anything else but once again thank you STEAK FACTORY. :) :D

This restaurant will never fail you and has maintained its high standard over the years. 
I visited on Feb 13 for dinner with my family. The first delightful thing is of course the great music, followed by the friendly and courteous staff. We ordered the assorted fries, onion rings, chef's salad, and chicken macaroni salad for starters. All yum! For mains we had the mixed grill sizzler, pork chops, chicken steak and fish n chips. And dessert was the creme caramel (which was not eggy at all which it can get) and strawberry souffle. 
Steak Factory is a place you can count on to deliver the best meal every time. Not just good food, but a holistic restaurant experience. 
I just have two suggestions for the management - please keep bread rolls as an option along with garlic bread, and please arrange for some ventilation in the front room - when multiple sizzlers are served, it gets a bit stuffy and uncomfortable.

On the afternoon of the Valentine's Day I went to The Steak Factory with my better half and my experience is really fascinating.
We heard a lot about Pork Ribs(for which it is famous for) but we went for Grilled Bhetki Sizzler and Lamb Ragout. I heard from somewhere that the ribs contain significant amount of fat, hence I avoided the Ribs.

Quality : The quality of the fish was too good and the served with fresh Beans, Carrot and Broccoli which made it out of the world. It was one of the best sizzler I ever had and creamy cheese all over the fish added a new dimension to deliciousness. 
Lamb Ragout is truly one of the best Lamb preparation. They made the gravy with red wine, pan fried gnocchi, grilled zucchini. They added Bell Pepper, Mushroom, Onions with the lamb, roasted and served with the gravy. Obviously Green beans, carrot and Broccoli was added with the dish and that tasted like heaven. The taste was overwhelming and really enjoyed the food over there.

Ambiance: A restaurant is incomplete without alluring surroundings. The steak factory is not a kind of restaurant where you will find it boring. They have a mammoth collection of movie, Rock Band posters (from the movie taxi driver to The Godfather) which makes the surroundings really appealing. Moreover the rock music in the background can boost the flavor of the continental dishes by a really good amount.

Service: The Service was really nice there. The waiters were really helpful and the lady at the counter was taking care of every details (I think it has improved after the bad review someone provided in Zomato, about the service). Overall it was a really nice experience on a day like 14th February.

Verdict : I would highly recommend my friends to visit the restaurant and would like to request them try something out of the box. Hopefully they will not let you come with an empty heart.

A friend and I went there earlier this afternoon looking to discover a quaint eatery hidden in the gullies of Kolkata. We weren't disappointed. The place plays rock songs and the ambience is simply soothing. We ordered a burger a steak and a starter. The food is delightfully delicious especially the steak. We are definitely coming back. I want to try the chicken salad.

It is a nice, small and cozy place with well planned interior design. We visited this place for valentine's day lunch, thought that the place would be flooded with crowd, but I was wrong.

We ordered chicken wings, grilled seafood sizzler, barbeque pork ribs, and for drinks, blue lagoon and coke. 

The chicken wing was quite good, except that the barbeque sauce was more on the sour side. The best dish was the grilled seafood sizzler that had bhetki, calamari and shrimps with a small bowl of seasoned rice. The sauce of this seafood platter was really good, a must try. 
But, to my disappointment, pork ribs were the worst pork ribs i ever had. Dipped in the same sauce as that of the chicken wings, the pork ribs were nothing but pure fat sticks, not at all worth the money. 

Overall it's more or less a good joint for food and to hangout, but, there is too much of a hype about their food.

Totally loved the place because of its food and ambiance. Very nice and cozy set up for a decent steak joint. As pork lovers we ordered pork ribs, delightfully devil with thick fat layer followed by the juicy meat below. The other magnificent dish was the fantastic bacon wrapped prawns. A bit of a disappoint was the Tenderloin steak for the reason that it was a bit too chewy for our tastes. Another great dish we tried here was the Fish Carnival which was fish beautifully baked in ¬†cheese served with spaghetti. For desserts and 
drinks we chose Chocolate Monte Carlo , Virgin Pinacolada and Virgin Mojito. Trust me , for the 4 of us the approximate bill was around 2500 which we thought was quite reasonable for the menu that we chose.
To conclude , this is a fantastic place to celebrate with food.

Yes this is my new favorite! I had heard about it quite a lot and decided to try it out today. It's a little in the Interior so locating the place is slightly inconvenient. Once you have found it, it seems like a small petite place. But the insides look decent. The music sounds great and the food is probably the 5/5 element here. I went there on an occasion day so was a little crowded. But the customer service was great, didn't have to wait for too long in spite of the crowd. The menu gives u a list of tempting delicacies, difficult  to narrow down your choices. I went for the chicken macaroni salad, chicken steak and the mix grilled sizzler. It was a little too heavy for even two of us but the food was awesome! Add to that poets of the fall, John Denver, and the likes maintaining the mood. The walls are filled with Lennon and Presley, etc. Customer service was really great. A great place to hang out! Brings a typical diner feel to the place.¬†

I definitely recommend this and surely am going back soon.

Terrible food ! The risotto was wretched ! Tasted like pulao for crying out loud. The grilled fish was anything but grilled! Shallow fried more like it ! The onion rings and wedges -- Hello pakoras ! Jeez ! The salad was like coleslaw ! They ran out of coke ! All of this happened in an hour ! Sigh such a disappointment ! Yes okay so we went to the steakhouse and didn't order steak but then if you can only do steak (which may or may not be great)  then limit the menu to just that

The Steak Factory. In two simple words, amazing experience. From the choice of music playing in the restaurant to the food, everything was just great. We had Pork Chops, Chicken sizzler and blue lagoon. Both the pork and chicken were tender and juicy. Nicely prepared. Both the sauce were different to taste but excellent nonetheless. The chicken slice was topped with mushroom and vegetables. Both the dishes were served with French fries. The blue lagoon could've been better. We had chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. The brownie was not actually brownie, it was basically a slice of a pretty mediocre chocolate cake with raisins in it. The scoop of ice cream with it was very tiny. But we were too overwhelmed with the main course to be disappointed with the dessert and drink. Will surely come back again. Keep it up! :D

Great place with awesome music, beautiful warming wall art of the 60s n 70s pop cult celebration. Any place that honors the great pop cult with pics of Floyd, the Doors and the like along with playing wonderful music ranging from diverse versions of rock and jazz is a refreshing alternative in kolkata. It is most ideal for unwinding especially on the quieter days when immersing in some great music and amazing food feels the exact calling. The food here indeed is beyond amazing. Each order is made fresh from scratch, prepped with details, and is high on quality. The staff team is great. They go out of their way to serve you catering to your preferences and are kind, friendly and attentive. All these itself will keep you coming back for more.
thank you team. You rock !!! And wishing you great success and joy in every way. We definitely needed a place like here in kolkata. We do love coming here.
p.s. : hoping for some vegan version of some yummy soup next time ;)

Went to there last saturday. The food was awesome. We had ordered ham steak and chicken ala kiev. Preparation was great as well as the presentation. I would love to go there again.
Just two thing I want to point out there. One is beer. They should start serving alcohol soon. And another thing, I heard they are opening a third outlet. They need to make sure about the location. The southern avenue outlet is not easy to accessible.

Ordered some takeaway from this spot a week ago. 2 prawn cocktails, a chicken burger and a ground meat burger both with cheese.

Prawn cocktails: The prawn cocktail sauce was good but the prawns were overcooked and and chewy.¬† 

The burgers: Inexplicably, while one burger had a proper bun cut in half, the other had half a bread roll as the base, and 1/2 of the top part of a bun (so 1/4 of a whole bun) on the top. Both patties tasted identical; mostly of potato and cheese and no distinguishable flavour of chicken or beef in either one. Very disappointing. 

Might try some of the rest of the menu in the far future but i would not order those burgers again. For some reason i thought a place called the Steak Factory would have¬† a nice meaty burger but i guess that's overoptimism on my part.

Pleasantly surprised with a very high quality food with fantastic pricing and a trendy sitting arrangements @ The Steak Factory.

Surely , this is an alternative to Mocambo for residents of South Kolkata.

Located just beside the Shibmandir Durga Pujo Prangan  - which is the first left once you take the alley beside Menoka Cinema. This joint definitely needs to be marketed better.

It is a casual dining place with tables of 4 and 2 with a good mix of students and families alike.

The menu is crisp and very nicely arranged.

I took my family of 4 and we ordered Cheese Garlic Break and French Fires for starters which was superb with the bread and the cheese specifically very fresh with herbs sprinkled.

For main course we ordered , Chicken Tetrazzini , Fish Carnival and Chicken Sizzler.

Fish carnival had a big fillet of Bhetki baked with cheese on top. We requested a cheesy white sauce, instead of the regular tomato / pepper  based red sauce. The pasta with the white sauce was delightful , with very good seasoning.

The chicken sizzler reminded me of Mocambo and Peter Cat ÔÅä. Again it was served with French fries and vegetables with a thick red gravy on top a big chicken breast with baked cheese on top. The gravy had mushrooms , red pepper and onions in it. Again, the quantity was good and filling , with the seasonings perfect.

The tetrazzini also was very well prepared with lots of chicken in the cheesy white sauce and the baking was perfect.

All of the above within 1400 rupees was the real treat ! !

It is amazing to see such a high quality food being prepared which can really compete with the continental joints of Park Street , at such good price point.

A definite 4.5 from me ‚Äì keep up the good work Steak Factory Team

A new joint at Southern Avenue ( near Shib Mandir Durga Puja) serving some unconventional dished in Kolkata.

Tried few days ago. The ambiance is calm & cosy, the people are courteous enough, though short staffed, and take some time to serve the dishes in peak time.

Ordered Barbeque Pork Rib, which tasty excelent, but with very few meat portion, mostly containing the fat, which I assume could have been served in better proportion.
Other than that the Chelow Kabab was also nice.

Need to visit, to try out Sizzlers..

The place is bit small but has a good ambience; nice decorations with framed posters ¬†on the walls. My personal feeling was that if they had used little bigger pictures it would have looked better. The person serving us knew about the food. The food was good at a reasonable price.¬†
The only problems that I felt was that the tables too close to each other and the dessert I had was not up-to the mark. Would definitely like to go back there sometime.

Well for one.....this place is aptly named. They really do make mouth watering steaks. The place maybe a little hard to find but its well worth the effort.
The Steak Factory offers a retro bar kinda look on the inside but its ironical given that the place doesn't have a bar.
I went over yesterday for my birthday & we ordered a Pork Chop steak, a Mixed grill sizzler and a Pot roasted mutton.
The dishes were exquisite.....the sauces complemented the meat and blended in a euphoria, slowly melting in the mouth. Overall it was a "meat-ful" experience and I simply loved it.
P.S. I am an avid meat lover so do overlook my biased opinions on the non-vegetarian dishes(but nonetheless they were exceptional).

If you are a great lover of steaks and pasta just like me, and a resident of Lake place, Southern Avenue come to The steak factory then without wasting any more time. the place is simply awesome providing excellent food, warm cozy ambience and of course dedicated stuffs. I just browse through their menu of steaks and bowled over; ham steak, chicken steak, pork chop, mutton steak, veg charcoal steak and what not. So I ordered chicken steak and must say it was fanta fabulous. On the sizzlers they have quiet a few sizzling items among which I chose grilled bhetki sizzler. I have a soft corner for kebabs so this time to satisfy my appetite I chose their chicken reshmi cheese kebab. Also on poison my favourite was grilled tiger prawns. My tummy was already full though I managed to have one strawberry souffl√©. The supple texture of souffl√© was silky melting in the mouth. Every item was mouth watering, naturally I wan to go there again and again. I have also noticed that they have also risotto on their menu which I love to try next time.

My first visit to this outlet was on 1st Jan 2015 and whoa !!! What a decision to start the year !! I'm completely bowled over... Food is just superlative.... Decor is warm and classy... Staff is very courteous... Indeed they have free Wifi !!!!!!
Only thing missing was options of alcoholic beverage... May be even a limited choice would have been great... Everything else is just perfect.... Even the dessert was splendid (Chocolate Monte Carlo)... But the Pulled Pork Sizzler was heavenly...
I am confused whether to put this place ahead of Mocambo :-O .... If you are coming from Southern Avenue, take the next right lane after Menoka (not the adjoining one to Menoka)... You will find the place at your left... Now don't waste time !!

I would say, "If you were to visit Heaven, then this is the place". The ambience is awesome. I had ordered Pork Ribs steak and a Mixed sizzler. The food was sublime in one word. Specially the steak. The staff were very friendly. ¬†We had ordered caramel custard for desert, even that was out of the world.
I wish it was situated a little closer to the main road but it hardly matters as i don't care where it is situated as long i get sumptous food out there.
On a serious note:
A must visit for everyone!

Awesome food and we are surely visiting this place once again. Staff is very courteous and service is prompt.

I had previously visited the New Alipore outlet and it was just around Durga Puja when I heard about the new one at Southern Avenue. I had really been impressed with my first experience and hence urged my sister and her friend to join me for lunch at the new joint. To begin with, we ordered three portions of the Fish steak. The abnormalities began when only one plate of food reached our table, and we were told that they were 'just' bringing in the other two. It struck us as a pretty strange thing since we'd ordered three plates of the same dish! We waited for roughly twenty minutes, (letting that plate of food get cold, because obviously one could not start eating alone) and when no one came, we asked the server to take it back and serve the three together. In the next few minutes, we were served our steaks. My plate of fish (which was the one that had been served earlier) in terms of appearance looked completely different from the other two. A few sides, like the onion rings were missing in the other two. When they cut into their fish, it was still so  undercooked that the meat was still red, tough and raw, whereas my steak cut through smoothly. We gave out plates back to our server and called for the chef. The chef, who was an extremely impolite and ill mannered fellow, came out with one of our plates with parts of the steak missing, strangely. He said there wasn't anything wrong with a shrug, and that we were reacting unnecessarily. At one point in this chaos, we felt like we were trying to make a man who had never eaten fish differentiate between raw and cooked. We were rather disgusted and chose to leave the restaurant than engage in a conversation with a man who honestly, had no knowledge about food. 
Sorry, The Steak Factory, but with that lingering, bad taste in our mouths, we are definitely never going back!

I was still in my New Years mood so I decided to have steaks to celebrate. And the Steak Factory seemed like the perfect choice. 
i ordered Assorted Fries. There were french fries, potato wedges, and onion rings. The potato wedges didnt taste very good but manageable with the dip they gave. The onion rings were nice. 
The pina colada was refreshing. 
Then we ordered Fish Carnival and Chicken Steaks. I really wanted to try chelow kabab but we were on a budget and had to choose only one, either chelow or steaks. And I chose this place mostly bcoz I wanted to try Steaks.  So I chose the latter but I was a little disappointed. The chicken steaks was nothing extraordinary , but boring. Simple meat taste with not so good sauce. The mashed potato wasnt something great either. I could have ordered the Ham steak or chelow kabab :/ 
The fish carnival on the other hand was amazing. Noodles with Cheese on fried fish. That was the dish of the day for us. 
lastly for dessert, we ordered Caramel Custard. Loved the Custard thing, but the syrup they used over it tasted like medicine, I dont know if thats the real taste of caramel or something. But a little pour over the custard would have been fine. but the custard was floating in it and it interfered with the taste.

This is fresh from super critical food lovers who try out every new eatery in the city. We went on the first day of 2015 and it was bang on spot. So fantastic when a 'first time' doesn't disappoint. Food was gorgeous, staff really really friendly. I asked for some butter and they gave me such a generous lump it amazed me! Lovely manager, very polite! I just hope they keep it up. Oh, bit of controversy, I thought the Chelow was better than Peter Cat's. Oh dear, did I just say that? Hell yeah!

Having been to the Alipore outlet before, I knew exactly what to expect. Adorned by posters of Spaghetti Western films, 1980s rock bands and 1970s pop artists, the cramped place does indeed offer an unique experience. Now lets come to the real part. The food. My favorites here have to be the pork chop, chicken steak, chicken wings and the spicy mutton meat balls! They really leave you wanting for more. The meat is tender and juicy. I am yet to find undercooked or overdone food here. My last visit was on 2015 New Year's Eve. We had their season's special roast turkey with cranberry sauce. In our case, they forgot the cranberry sauce. But the rest more than made up for it. Overall, if you are a steak lover and happen to be in Kolkata, this is one of the joints to visit. Bon Apetit!

A big thank you to "the steak factory" for the delicious dinner on 31st night! It was my first visit and I plan to repeat my visits to this place often :) we ordered grilled chicken steak, barbecue pork ribs, fish carnival and choc Monte Carlo! The chicken was tender and the white sauce made it brilliant! I wish the mashed potato was slightly better. The pork ribs too were well cooked and soft. The fish carnival was an amazing dish and the pasta served with it was yummy! The dessert could have been a little better. However, over all I was really satisfied and I will definitely visit this place soon again :)

24/05/15 Updated review.. This sunday I had visited this place for dinner with a bunch of friends.This was my fourth or fifth visit to this place and it would surely be my last.
We were informed pork was unavailable.I was utterly disappointed because I felt the barbeque pork ribs and the pork chops were their best offering.Anyway we settled for a beef steak and a ham steak instead.But alas! The beef steak they served us were absolutely rotten. It smelled horrible and we simply could not fathom how on earth could they serve such nonsense.On complaining they obviously replaced it.By the time it was replaced with a ham steak,we found both the ham steaks were also rotten.They also smelled horrible and we all felt pukish.We asked for the manager but were told he was unavailable.The staff courteously offered us complimentary desserts but our experience was simply disgusting.
It was totally unexpected from a reputed place and a place that I had recommended to people before.After this experience I am never visiting this place again and I will make sure none of my friends do so.

Firstly,I am a huge lover of steaks and I am quite a fan of the New Alipore outlet of the Steak Factory which I have visited multiple times.This is the newer outlet in Southern Avenue.The location is a bit tricky.This place can be reached either from one of the lanes beside Menoka Cinema or from the Mudiali bus stand.Since this is situated much more conveniently from my place,I was very excited about this and I have already visited it a few times.My experiences have been good overall barring one bad experience with¬† the staff.

The menu is similar to the Alipore branch with Steaks and a few Italian and Continental preparations.Among the dishes I have had here,my favourite is the Barbeque Pork Ribs.Their barbeque sauce is just immaculate.The pork is well cooked and tender.The Pork Chops are also brilliant.But the pork chops contain more fat than meat.It is something that I do not mind at all being a huge fan of pork fat.But others may have a problem with this I guess.The Pork ribs also contain a lot of fat but the meat to fat ratio is better from a neutral point of view.
The Ham Steak was one preparation which really impressed me at the Alipore branch but here I felt it was disappointing.The Ham was rather undercooked and very difficult to chew.The quantity too I felt was too little.The Factory Mixed Grill both the normal and the sizzler variant is pretty nice too.The thing about the steaks and grills here is that the sauces are brilliant.They hit the spot as they say.
The Pulled pork burger was decent but I wish it was a little more meaty!The Ham Burger was quite nice though.I chose a beef patty and it was a huge juicy patty that I really enjoyed.Other than these I also tasted the Blackened Fish and it was rather average.Overall the steaks are undoubtedly the stand out here.

Coming to the service,it is the one thing that really left me disappointed on one of my visits.They are more or less swift with the orders.But once when I let them know that the Ham steak was undercooked,they simply refused to accept that fact and gave a number of reasons.I found that attitude really bad.On that day only I had asked the particular waiter to clear the plates we had finished and he ended up doing so after telling him so at least 4 times.I was really disappointed on that visit.But I do admit my experiences with the service on my other visits have been much better.

The ambience is pretty good.They have tried to give a European feel to the place with the decor and the posters of popular singers and movies donning the walls.The choice of music is pretty good and quite to my liking.The space is quite small and a little bit cramped up.The prices are moderate.

Overall The Steak Factory is surely the kind of place for a meat lover like me.I do feel meat lovers will enjoy this place and I would recommend people to stick to the steaks and the meaty stuff.Its a place I liked on the whole but I wish I did not have that one bad experience with the staff.

It was such a disgusting place... The food was shit... And they take 500 bucks in tax which is simply a slap to your face... The steak was so plain and tastes so bad and everything costs too damn much. Moreover we had to wait for more than an hour, so guys my suggestion please skip this place if you can, there are lots of better places to eat at where the waiters don't mistreat you.

Steak factory is a small but cozy eatery or 'diner' in their own words. Steaks are their forte. We tried almost all of them. Starting from ham to beef. They are served with boiled veg and mashed potatoes or french fries. Ham steak is quite a tasty experience. But when it comes to beef steak it simply fails to live up to the expectations. Beef is fibrous and not well made at all. We tried barbecued pork ribs also. The pork is well cooked and succulent enough minus the fat. The poisson preparations are the ones I liked the most especially the blackened fish. Bacon wrapped prawns will top the list as far as starters are concerned. Overall eating experience is more than satisfactory and thankfully it doesn't make a hole in your pocket.

All my Life I've been waiting for you :P !

Location : Between Golpark and Deshapriya Park .This is a tricky one so try to keep up. The shortest Route would be Somehow make it to "Menoka" Cinema hall. Then take the adjoining lane. Then a 3-point beckons you. Take the lane with a Salon at the corner.Walk straight till you get blocked and take a right and you should be able see the place on your left . Believe me this is the only downside they have !!

Ambiance : Looks practically like a modern steakhouse from every angle. With old movie posters and pics of Woody Allen adorning the walls and "Poets of the Fall" and "Bryan Adams" playing gently in the background, this place brings a smile to your face even before the food arrives. The staff is courteous and extremely English Savvy ( Cool : To be precise) which is a big relief ! In fact there's a guy who asked us after every dish how the dish appealed to us ! Clearly they care a lot about the final product and the Image of the place :) . Seats are for about 40 people in total.¬†

Food : Ah now let's come to the Grub ! To start we ordered the "Chicken Nuggets" which came pretty quick . Eight bite sized teats with a fabulous Dip. Now came the "Mutton Chop" and the Pork Chop" . The first thing about both the dishes was the attention to detail. The garnishing was perfect. The mutton chop was melt in your mouth juicy accompanied by some veggies, caramalised onions and French Fries. Now for the Pork Chop. While it wasn't done in the traditional Barbeque Brown sauce yet it was every bit tasty. What amazed me was the fact : The chop was so well done that I barely needed the Serrated Knife which I assure you is a big deal for people who have had pork chops before. One literally needs to Jostle with the meat ! It just cut away like butter !!! It wasn't done rare ( No pink hues inside ) but medium. It was of healthy size and I can assure you the price was the most Economical for this dish no matter where ever you eat !. As usual the veggies, onions and French fries were present.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Since we were starving to begin with, we went for the " Fish n Chips" and yet again quantity and quality bang on ! Most probably Basa fish in the making and yet again a marvellous Dip ! ¬†Finally time for Desserts : First came the "Caramel Custard" . Simple dish and even better execution. Great texture and tasted great.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Really getting tired of appreciating these guys to this extent :P ! But they did something soon after that really made me very happy . Since I'm a "Strawberry"addict , I asked for a mocktail based on it but their faces drew a blank. But the waiter suggested " I could replace the Orange Flake Mocktail" with Strawberry and I rejoiced at the idea and the final product. They made something specially for me and it too tasted heavenly.¬†

Cost for 2 : 1000-1200/- ( With taxes n all)

Final Conclusion : ¬†I LOVE em ! For people with European and American tastes if you are reading this : GET THERE PRONTO !! It's the place we have been searching for ages ! Great price and value for Money. The waiting time is minimal as well. Great staff , great atmosphere and vibe ! ¬†An absolute Recommendation from me. I'd give them 5/5 if only it were easier to find !

I have been hearing about The Steak factory since a very long time and have been seeing pictures of the yummy food on my Facebook and I couldn't wait to come to India and check this place out. I went to the restaurant few days back and I was really happy to see a restaurant which has a cozy feel to it as well as the food is awesome. I had the grilled fish and I was left wanting  more and the caramel custard was just out of the world. I shall definitely come back again cz this is one place I can relax eat good food and have a good time with my friends!

Wow..
Food was great.
Ambi too good
Staff friendly.
Value for money. Yes sure.

Ordered a pasta salad, a veg steak and lemon ice tea. 
Good decor, nice music.
The only issue I had was getting that place on a map..
It was hard for a person new in Kolkata to find it.

P.S. Please upload map on zomato.

Been there today afternoon for lunch with a group of friends after a grueling 6days of exams. Being in the merchant navy we have tasted steaks all over the world and were pleasantly surprised to find a steak house in our own city. The ambience was somewhat diner-like.
Coming to the food..order was -
Chicken steak
Chicken grilled steak
Fish and chips
Ham steak
Pork chop steak
Chocolate Monte Carlo
Caramel custard
Brownie with ice cream

All the items including the coolers and the deserts were very well prepared. Each preparation lived up to its name . Tasted distinctly different from each other. The best were the pork steaks, tender and soft and cooked to perfection.

Kuddos to the management for opening up such a place.
Wondering when they are opening a branch in Salt lake side.

We had a great Sunday Lunch at this small yet cosy Restaurant in the hub of South Kolkata. We felt very much welcome as we entered the place nicely decorated like an American Pub. The entire team is very warm, helpful & friendly. We enjoyed our warm & juicy Pork Chop, well-made & lavish Barbecued Pork Ribs & a near-perfect steaming Chicken Sizzler Steak. The yummy Strawberry Souffle was absolutely out of this world. We enjoyed every moment our stay at The Steak Factory & promise to come back again. Until then remain just the way you are !!

Dined out here on the 9th of December and I can quite confidently say that it was one of my better dining experiences. I found no fault with the food, nor any with the ambience. The d√©cor of the restaurant was very homey, the walls decorated with movie and music posters.¬†

The food itself was well presented and came in decent portions. Starters with drinks were very promptly served. The rest of our order was not delayed either. The steaks were cooked perfectly!

The staff are very friendly, prompt in service, and professional. The thing that pleased me most was when I peeked into the kitchen, I noticed the chef's wearing hats, some sort or the other. This probably made dining much easier, knowing that I would NOT have to pull hair out of my soup.¬†

The only fault I could find with the restaurant, was with the seating. You may end up feeling a little cramped considering the benches that are supposed to seat 2 people, just about does it. This is possibly the only thing that can and should be looked into. Pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. Thanks.

Good decor, poor order suggestion, poor order taking, after one hour of order food was served (chicken sizzler) was stale, bland without garnish, with mushroom in spite of specifically informing not to put them. A sure waste of evening and money.

Located in the much known neighborhoods of south Kolkata STEAK FACTORY for some strange reasons evoked memories/imageries of one of those motels on a highway where you find yourself  warm cosy and hearty meal. The d√©cor is simple,comfortable and minimal . The food in terms of quality and variety has scopes for improvement . Service could have been a little more fast as we were sitting for almost 15-20mins for our garlic breads while the steak was aready served . It is easy on your pockets . Overall though not one of those suave fine dining places around one can drop in for a decent meal at a reasonable price and return with  smile ÔÅä

Visited this place with two friends last week. It wasn't too difficult to locate the place. The ambience of the place won me over. The low lit lamps,
Marilyn Monroe and woody Allen posters (I couldn't be happier to see him ^_^) and crimson walls are perfect for a lazy indulgence.The one piece menu card reminded me of beautiful beach side shacks of Bangkok.We ordered for Cajun fish fry, factory special steak,charcoal grilled chicken, and pork ribs straightaway. Cajun fish : a pure orgasm in your mouth.It just transforms you to another world with its perfectly marinated fish and creamy Tartar sauce.A great kick start. The factory special steak is a cheese ladened large piece of meat.it was well Cooked throughout and you can get the right balance of a complete dish by having it with the mashed potatoes and sauted spiced onions that are provided with it. The charcoal grilled chicken was a dissapointment,probably because of the butter sauce which was bland to be precise.The highest point : pork ribs in barbeque sauce- succulent fat ladened bone which has the right amount of well cooked meat at the end of it.It blew my mind(P.S :barbeque sauce always does that to me :D )Coming to desserts, apple pie was what I wanted and what wasn't available.But the home made white and dark chocolate cookies that were being sold at a corner. were sufficient enough to keep our sweet teeth calm. A pleasent touch to the entire experience.
Visit this place again?.- absolutely. :)

Ambience and decor were nice but quality of food and service were pretty poor..had ordered for ice teas , assorted fries and the Cajun fish for starters ..the fish was nice but the wedges tasted like aloo pakoras. Main course was a buff steak, hamburger and a chicken sizzler.. Buff steak was ok but the sizzler and the burger was horrible .. I really feel bad for being so negative but it was that bad.. The patty of the burger had more of aloo than meat and even the sizzler was all saucy and ketchupy...starters took quite a while to arrive and had to request twice for the ice teas... Even the dessert (Montecarlo) was unimpressive..Had a lot of expectations from the look of the place but was sadly disappointed:(

this is one of the over-hyped places I have recently visited in Kolkata. well, we all know in Kolkata you get Beef and not buff and that is why during the pujas when I went to kolkata I thought of having the steak there. along with that we have also ordered for pork ribs. the things we get 1. Buff , 2. too much fat on pork ribs. However, they were courteous enough to apologize and not to charge for the inedible pork ribs. I was also disappointed with the steak too. Too much of sauce and the buff spoiled it all. Still giving it 3 because of their professional and courteous behavior.

Walked in to steak factory yesterday for a meal and boy were we happy! Finding this place can be a bother so double check on your GPS to find your way here. But once you are here you are in foodie heaven.
The interiors of the place are nicely done in shades of dark brick red with pop art hanging from the walls and timeless music from all ages playing on the background. Also free WiFi (yayyy!!!).
We ordered a ham steak and barbeque pork ribs. The ham steak came with sweet onions, mashed potatoes, saut√©ed veggies and a piece of sweet pineapple. The steak itself was perfectly cooked, juicy and moist and medium rare and just the right amount of fat and gravy! A winner of a dish! The barbeque pork ribs were fabulous too! Nice tasty pork ribs dripping with barbeque sauce and the meat came clean off the bone as we ate. What more can one ask? We ate our meals in complete silence for 20 mins. 
Service is really fast and cordial. The pricing is a bit steep when you add the 20% tax to the menu. Otherwise its a wonderful place for your steak cravings!

Wow what an ambience, this has become one of my favorite places from today, the old school retro style did catch my attention while I stepped in, the food when served, was really finger licking, specially the Chicken cocktail sausage, followed with chicken steak and garlic bread. For a couple it would charge 1000 bucks, but the money is really worth spending. Service is really good, thinking of visiting soon.

Located conveniently near Karma Fitness studio near mudiali, this diner is a huge step forward towards american style dining. Much better than their Alipore counterpart, where parking hassles ruin your dining experiences.
Went there with a bunch of friends, and were among the first ones to visit them after they had opened up. Some of the facilities were yet to be operational- they were setting up the Wifi and the coffee machine was yet to be installed, still the satff were very friendly and polite.
We ordered BBq Pork Ribs, Bacon Wrapped Prawns,Factory Mixed Grill, Spaghetti carbonara, Chicken Steak and Coke.
They make undoubtedly one of the best Ribs in town. Juicy Fatty, intense, with rustic flavours- trust me, they are now my go to place for Rib cravings.
Bacon wrapped prawns were great, only complain, they used too small a size of prawns for the dish.Spaghetti carbonara was as elegant and smooth as it could be, and they happily replaced the bacon with chicken ham strips, extra points for customer friendliness and accomodation.Chicken steak was okayish, slightly dry, and they kind of made the sauce too sour. Coffee was unavailable. but they apologised profusely for just setting up the place.
Extra mention for the owner lady and the guy-must be her hubby, who interacted with us, asked us to test for the free Wifi they provide and kept asking for feedbacks- dishwise!!
love the place. would definitely visit and recommend others. Especially for their Ribs.Yet to try out their desserts which i have heard are pretty good too.

Visited this place last wednesday with my family. We ordered for a chicken steak, ham burger and apple pie with ice cream. Needless to say the chicken steak was soft and tender. Coming to the ham burger I wanted a patty of ¬†beef tenderloin so i told the server who welcomed us with a warm smile. The burger was pure heaven. The beef tenderloin was supple and juicy. The apple pie was delicious. We enjoyed our dinner. But i wanted to talk about this new set of homemade cookies that this place is selling--- white chocolate cookies and chocolate cookies. The cookies are just amazing. They have the right amount of crunch and choco chips in them. Its a must try. I am planning to get few more of these cookies.

Visited this place last Thursday evening with few of my friends. I couldnt help but write this review. We ordered one beef steak , ham burger , pulled pork burger and pot roasted mutton. The food was just pure bliss. The beef was just outrageously perfect. Yes i am bound to use this phrase 'outrageously perfect' coz most of the times beef steaks are chewy but not the the beef steak of "The Steak Factory". Now coming to the ham burger, i would vouch for it that this place serves the best burgers in town. The ham is prepared with so much care that it almost melts in your mouth letting you enjoy the layers of savoury flavours bit by bit. Apart from these the pulled pork burger was the ultimate show stopper. It was ecstatic. Even this would be an understatement for the legendary 'pulled pork burger' of steak factory. One bite of this burger and it would be a feast of flavours for your palate. The owner of steak factory should really start up a food truck now so that we can enjoy many such scrumptious burgers here and there. The Steak factory is taking it to a completely different level. To me its the best place for all the foodies in town. Thumbs up.

We had gone there today for dinner after suffering a dilemma between mocambo and this place ..
Needless to say this small quaint place fashioned like an american diner is located just beside karma fitness studio....
But this place promises lots of fat , bacons , chicken, sausages and happy tummy ....
We ordered prawns wrapped in bacon,
Chicken sizzler , factory mixed grill sizzler, factory mixed grill , and chicken and steak grill....
The starter was amazing ... The main course was good but not amazing as the starter had promised... The sauces left an aftertaste which was pretty sour..
All in all a nice place...
Definitely worth a visit!
P.s there's a reason why mocambo remains a favourite inspite of these new haunts is because of its consistent quality!

I absolutely loved my experience at Steak Factory'r Alipore branch and therefore was very excited when A told me there is a new one near Menoka!

Located near the Karma Fitness this place is bigger than the Alipore branch! We ordered Virgin mojito, shrimp cocktail, chicken a-la king and grilled seafood sizzler.

The Mojito, was a little too less quantitywise, same goes for the shrimp cocktail. The quantity needs major change!!! Taste-wise, it was above average! The chicken a-la-king was not very good to taste. It was not bad either. Somewhere in between.

The seafood sizzler however was the hit show! I have been completely bowled over! There was just exact amount of meat and cheese and rice and everything that was there! I reached seventh heaven! Although I was not impressed with the food otherwise, the last dish won my heart and I would give this place a 4.5.

The service is sweet. They would take good care of you, serve when needed, nod and smile. ¬†Try this place :)

I had a mixed experience here. ¬†The decor is minimal while the HP sauce on each table looked nice but I would have preferred the Jack Danielle steak sauce over this.¬†

Coming to the food, we had chicken wings which was nicely done though bit hot to my liking still fine. The chicken steak was cooked properly but the point which perhaps the restaurateur missed was steak is a whole dish and one does not need to order something with it but their choice of veggies served alongside were horridly less and the platter looked empty to the best. I hope they would fix this otherwise it would be a scaled down version of ¬†"steak".¬†

The fresh lime water was ¬†unfortunately far from being a restaurant quality.

You have a decent concept of fine dining eatery but perhaps it is still a work in progress, cheers...

We went on a monday evening 27/10/2014.There was only one customer other than us.The staff was polite but not very much well versed with the items.
We ordered for bacon wrapped prawns.. Which was not at all at per with other restaurants...its not at all prawn...its shrimp.Pot roasted mutton was undercooked..with a heap of overcooked rice...mutton chops..oh its actually an Indian kind of bara...though tastewise okay. The only good item was chicken Parmigiana..amongst what we ordered and even the garlic toast could have been tastier.... pricewise not a bad idea to go there....

A strange non-availability was that finger bowls - not really something one would think as likely to be so.....

As my sister suggested we went for a quick dinner. The ambiance was neat. More like an English cafe I would say. Service was pretty prompt.¬†
We ordered for Ham steak, Chicken Steak and a Chicken Sizzler. All of them were served pretty fast and tasted descent enough.
I particularly liked the decor. The only thing which I felt needs to be taken care of is the seating space. Although they have tried to utilize the little space as economically as possible. But the 2 seating sofas were pretty small to fit in...
Overall a good place to hangout with friends.

We were really happy to hear about the new Steak Factory at Southern Avenue, as all of our friends are big meat lovers. Finally the four of us decided to go there a few days back but to our utter disappointment the experience was, well, tasteless!¬†

After getting denied for a few minutes (not available, this is over, we cant make this etc) we ordered the Chef's special salad and sausage fries. Cannot even recall the drink we ordered...as forgettable as it was. The fried sausages were the best bit. They tasted good (we later realised that was because it was a simple case of frying the frozen sausage - no extra work was needed). So no hidden surprises there. The Chef's special salad turned out to be extremely special as it was an onion salad with double-extra mayo and even more onions. I found three strips of bell peppers and 4 small pieces of chicken. The rest of the salad was simply an onion-fest. There was nothing else in it.¬†

By the time we had put aside the half-eaten salad, the main course arrived (if only we had waited until the starters were done to know more about the culinary prowess of the chef, we would have left right after it). Anyway, hungry & gullible meat-lovers are known to give every restaurant the proverbial 'I am sure the main course will be good' treatment. So the pork chops, spaghetti with meatballs (chicken, of course - god forbid a meat joint will have anything else available!), and spaghetti bolognese arrived.¬†

Let me break down the experience.

1. Pork chops - 2 inches of thick under-cooked fat attached to a 0.5mm strip of meat. Yummy!
2. Chicken-ball spaghetti - burnt balls (no pun intended) that tasted like soya nuggets and were dry. So dry-soya tasting-burnt balls of chicken. Spaghetti was of cheap quality and ever so slightly under-cooked.¬†
3. Bolognese - messy, salty sauce dumped on the same cheap, under-cooked spaghetti.

Along with the main course I had also ordered a caramel custard for dessert (nothing else was available). It tasted okay - or maybe by that time our expectations and taste buds had taken such a nosedive that anything which was not meat-related would have tasted great.¬†

However, the place itself was quite cosy and pretty with a movie and music poster decor and cute cosy four-seater tables.

Maybe, the chef was having  a bad day - I don't know. Maybe, they had a record sell that day and ran out of most stuff by the time we arrived (9:50 PM). Maybe, nowadays anyone who can turn the oven on is a self-proclaimed Chef. Maybe, it rained in Sumatra. Maybe, we should have left right after the starters (keeping the hope alive that the main course may have been good). Maybe the New Alipore one is better. Or maybe, this is not a restaurant. But needless to say I had to come home and have a banana. Never again.

RATING BREAKDOWN:
1 STAR - GOOD DECOR
0.5 STAR - SAUSAGE & CUSTARD

Good for 1 visit, and probably not going to visit again. The decor+ambience is nicely different, minimalist and not loud. We ordered assorted fries to start, which was fine, with the correctly flavoured tartar sauce. Main course was 1 - Fish n Chips - Now, when I order FnC, I expect to see some nice fillets that will satiate ur hunger. These fillets were really slim and very average sized ones, good for a fish fry but not for Fish n Chips. Though, there was nothing to complain about it's breading or frying, but these were small fillet.
The next we ordered a Grilled seafood sizzler and again, it came in a small-ish platter with some basa, exactly 2 shrimps (really, 2?!!) and lots of calamari, veg and fries. Tasted quite all right, but nothing great and again, too little in quantity.¬†
Overall: Food tastes good, but is overpriced given the serving size. Like I said, Good for 1 visit, and probably not going to visit again.

The Steak Factory... a bit off route.. near the shibmandir puja.. but a sweet nd serene little place..
Firstly the ambience nd decor gives a pretty sophisticated look to d place.. I liked d lighting at each table.. posters add quite a flavour..
Coming to d food..
We orderd Spicy Meatballs, Factory Mixed Grill, Chicken Reshmi Cheese Kabab, Factory special Cheese Steak nd Pork Chop..
All d dishes were well made.. factory special cheese steak nd reshmi cheese kabab stood out..to b better of d lot.. nd definitely quite delicious..
Pricing is standard..
Service was a tad bit clumpsy..but considering d pujo frenzy nd d rush.. I guess d clumsiness cn b ignored...
Free wifi wasn't of much help tho..
Overall a really nice place..with quite a variety of dishes..wl get an A+ for quality nd quantity..
Looking forward to try out more dishes..soon

Fantastic and authentic steaks and other continental cruisine at a very reasonable price. Done beautifully at the ground floor of an old house. Well decorated with good ambience. Needs a bit more variety to match Mocambo. Keep it up. Looking forward to visit again shortly.

I heard about this restaurant from a friend of mine and the name caught my attention immediately. The Steak Factory! Immediately a huge chunk of BEEF came to mind but I was a bit disappointed when there was no beef in the menu.¬†
Finding this place was a bit tricky, needed two to three calls for directions but found it eventually. I was surprised at how nice this place looked from the inside. It's a small ground floor apartment turned into a restaurant and they have done a good job at it. It's a small place with sober interiors and classy furniture with just about the proper amount of lighting and background music to make you comfortable (no, no Honey Singh in there, all "pleasant to the ear" music). We reached around 4 o clock so it was not crowded at all. The waiter was very friendly and courteous and we got our food in no time.

For starters we ordered Prawns wrapped in Bacon and Spicy Meatballs and for the main course I ordered the Pork Chop with fries to the side and my friend ordered a Factory Special Cheese Steak, choice of meat being Lamb with mashed potatoes to the side.The prawns wrapped in bacon were simply HEAVENLY. It was cooked perfectly and the portions were a bit larger than many other bigger restaurants I've tried in Kolkata or Delhi (Steak Factory don't get ideas to make them smaller, please). My friend and I were lost in meat heaven. The Spicy meatballs were excellent too. By now my friend and I realized this was good stuff and everything tasted so fresh and well cooked! Meatball portions were decent but for the price could've been a bit more.

Now for the main course. You would expect the steak to be big considering it is a STEAK but it wasn't as big as I had hoped when we saw my friends steak. I ordered a pork chop so it can't get bigger really but whenever I've had Pork Chops elsewhere mostly it had more meat and lesser quantities of fat but this portion had 90% fat and 10% meat so beware of it please. For those who like pork fat, eat away, I am not a big fan but it tasted good so I had it anyway.. a bit reluctantly. I also had a bite of my friends steak and it tasted a bit too Indianised for my taste but my friend liked it.

All in all this is an excellent small new place which has excellent potential. I just hope they don't ruin it by going over their heads just like many other small joints that have opened up in the city. Do note that for a proper foodie (like me) their steak portions might not be much but for a person who just wants to have tasty bite, it might just work. Do try this place. It is recommended a 100% by me, just note that the Pork chop LITERALLY has 90% fat but my friends steak had all meat. So do ask before you order.

Do I think that the price justifies the food? For the main course definitely yes but for the starters no, it should be lesser, I mean come on, main course AND starter prices are almost the same!? and a small glass of coke for 70 bucks!? Come on guys! I understand you have a nice place here but lets not confuse ourselves with Park Street restaurants.
¬†
Apart from this all I have to say is keep it up! I've already told good things about you guys to my friends across the country.

Walked in to a quaint little place whixh reminded me of a pub. The walls were lined with old engliah film posters ans rockstars from the yester years. The food, which is what this place should really be known for is fabulous. We ordered the beef steak, ham steak, spaghetti with meat balls and the grilled fish. Portions are just right. Both the chef and the owners are obviously well travelled and have good knowlwdge of food because the taste was authentic and cooked to perfection. Extremely excited to have an super steak place in the south of Cal. Will be back again very soon.

After visiting the Alipore branch,finally visited the Souther Avenue branch on 27th Sep.First of all its situated near the Shib Mandir Puja Pandel and Karma Gym and bit away from Menoka Cinema.The staff is awesome.The lady at the counter and the guy with him made a point to visit every table and ask about the food.

we ordered the Shrimp cocktail,brilliant as usual.

Then the Factory cheese stake,with choice of Chicken,it was awesome.

The Chicken Steak were good as well.

The Blackened fish was a bit of disappointment.The portion was small,and in comparision to the other steaks the taste wasnt great.But was ok overall.

A very pleasant experience overall.

My 1st impression was this is a ground floor converted into a restaurant! How good it could be!! Alas I was wrong! Me & my friend ordered Cream of Chicken, Bacon wrapped Prawns, Buffalo Tenderloin Steak, Pork , Factory Mixed Grilled Sizzler & Lime & Bitters. Lemme tell u each & every portion went inside my mouth was stupendous. I seldom (probably never) tasted this good food earlier. Special recommendations are BWP, PC & L&B. 0.5 marks cut for service. RECOMMENDATION: A Must Visit

Well The Steak Factory name says it all. I am very paticular about steak's and would not eat it just anywhere. This is one of those places I would go again. It opened two weeks back so I wld give them some more time. The menu is very interesting it's got a lot to offer, I was a bit surprised at the quantity (glass size) of the virgin mohito given.to me bt am not complaining just a suggestion could use a bigger glass the ham stake was nice a bit chewy towards the end but it's ok its just me the dessert however have to say has to b worked on.considering caramel custard is my favoooooooite dessert was.a bit disappointed abt the taste bt no worries am sure they will improve it the seating is very cozy but if 4 ppl go then mite get a bit cramped up but it's cozy ambiance is greeeeeeat loved it completely great music fits perfectly
Hoping to go back soon and trying out rest of the menu......
Cheers

This place was recommended to me by a friend of mine. Its a very cozy small food joint. The sitting is quiet comfortable, the dim lights, the soothing music makes the ambiance perfect. 

The food is definitely mouth watering. If you are a steak lover, u should definitely visit Steak factory. I had ordered mojito, Pork chop, Ham steak for main course and caramel custard for dessert. My steak was soft, half done because I don't like my steak to be well done and very hard, as I believe u kill the taste of the meat if it's well made. And trust me, I am definitely going back again. 

The best part is, the price is quiet reasonable. The owner is very sweet. And am very happy with my experience.

Bon App√©tit !!

A cool place to eat out owned by a beautiful lady...Apologies Ma'am ...I didnt ask for your name.¬†

Went there to beat my late evening apetite. Simple yet cool decor. Varied and interesting menu. I always wanted to try their food but never hot an opportunity to visit their Alipore outlet. This being close to my home is gonna be my regular hangout place.¬†
¬†
It was their opening day when I visited. Some soft music in the background and decor in red and wooden furnishing to give an all American look. staffs were courteous enough. In fact, the lady came to suggest me on my choice of dish. I chose to have Blackned Fish. the food arrived in no time. The portion was generous. A filled of sea bass grilled with spices and topped with sour cream, accompanied with mashed potatoes and veggies and some grilled onion rings. The food was absolutely delicious and quiet filling. The fish was perfectly cooked, so were the other side portions.

This place is a must visit for all food lovers...

cant wait to try out the other delicacies........

We had a factory special cheese steak. Our choice of meat was pork. This was the best steak I've had in my life hands down.
