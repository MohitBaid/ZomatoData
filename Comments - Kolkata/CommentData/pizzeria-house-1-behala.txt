Food : It didn't really meet my level of expectation!
Cheese balls were not at all soft and yum.

Service : Well the lady who took our order wasn't cooperative.
She had a very glum and displeasing look on her face, I don't know why!
She even ordered us to come and place the order in the counter, saying it's a self service/self help store.

Ambience: Okayish!
 They kept on playing the same songs over and over again.

Overall experience : Average.

One fine day I wanted to amazon prime and chill with some pizza üçï. Then I say this restaurant in Swiggy. I ordered a pizza from here and had it watching some good movie in amazon prime. 2 hours after having the pizza, I felt dizzy. I didn't feel good. The next day, guess what, I had FOOD POISONING! The last day I had none but some light food throughout the day and the pizza for dinner. I'm pretty sure the pizza has shitty quality.

I had ordered a Grilled Chicken Steak and got a complimentary Chocolate Mug with my order. The rating of the place is decent, and it's one of the few that delivers to my place - needless to say, I had some expectations. But both the items were pretty BAD. The Chocolate Mug is basically a glass of milk with chocolate flavoured Complan or something(?), and the Chicken Steak was so bad that I had to leave it midway. The rice they served with it was extremely thick, and even the sauteed veggies were just as bad.

Definitely not recommended.

To start, I wanted to give it a negative rating if that was possible. Don't get mislead by the 1 which I gave. We ordered 3 lasagne which are on the menu and all of them were horrible. The restaurant itself had a bad ambience and the people providing services were of a horrible nature as well. We went there with a lot of expectations but were already regretting as soon as we saw the served food. Who serves food in aluminium foil containers? Even dhaba's serve their food in a better way and it tastes thousand times better. Speaking of the taste of food, everything was so horrible that all we could do was laugh on ourselves thinking that where we just wasted our money. Please think it over atleast 10 times before you even plan to come here.

Food: Ordered Napoletana Chicken Lasagna with Mudhroom and Chicken Lime Coriander Sizzler. Quality was moderate, and the sizzler chicken was hard. The lasagna was more or less good but could have been much better.

Ambience: Not up to the mark. We were the only customers over a span of one and half hours. The staff could try applying some deodorant on their bodies. The air-conditioning is almost not there. Overall a very poor ambience.

Service: This was mostly ok.

Overall, you msy visit once, but definitely not a place to go over and over again.

P.S. They also make pizza's which are quite nice

We ordered pasta in Bolognese sauce and chicken roasted salad in the evening of 11th October. The taste of food was good. But the restaurant area was not so clean and the music was exceptionally loud. Even after requesting to slow down the music, the lady who was sitting in the counter didn't listen and continued the music with same pace. The music was very loud and disturbing and forced us to leave the restaurant as fast as possible.

Love the food. Though a bit pricy compared to the neighborhood but its all worth it. Have tried the four cheese pizza which was loaded with cheese melting in our mouths ( my sister's favoriteüòÄ) along with the chicken mexican pizza which i liked but not too much ( dont like tomatoes üòí). The sizzler dish chicken with lemon and chilli coriander won my heart. The rich white creamy sauce which was generously given over a large piece of chicken along with herb rice and pasta and fresh vegetables was "Simply Delicious"!! My friends loved the BBQ Chicken wings which was big pieces of wings drenched in sweet BBQ sauce.

Tried their pepperoni pizza, margherita pizza and peri peri fries.
Both pizzas lacked tomato sauce/pizza sauce and hence failed to pack the punch. The pepperoni tasted a bit bland to be honest and seemed like an overpriced option for the taste they are serving. 
They also forgot to put in the oregano on their delivery.
The fries were tossed generously with peri peri and I loved that they kept mayonnaise on the table and not as an extra on the menu.
A fresh option in the area for delivery/dine-in
but lacks the.. tang üçÖ.

The place is not very far from chowrasta and very near to shakuntala park. The place is easy to locate. We went there during the pujas and like all other restaurants we were given a puja special menu card. To be honest which was just as fine because we wanted to have just pizza. The interiors were cool and classy. And overall a nice place to hangout with friends. Initially we were a bit apprehensive about the food but the food turned out to be quite good. We had napoli lamb minced pizza and carnivora pizza. The double layers of cheeze just melted in the mouth. Cheers to the team. Hope to visit again.

On a busy weekdays, this cafe was explored by myself and my best friend and it really satisfied our  tastebuds.. It is easy to locate, just 3-4 mins away from Sakuntala Park (over main road).. We ordered one polo (8 inches) pizza (‚Çπ 200), one chocolate mug (‚Çπ 150), one mountain mojito (‚Çπ 100), one babycon fritters (‚Çπ 120), one strawberry basil soda (‚Çπ 100) and one iced coffee (‚Çπ 120)...Yes, we were thirsty as hellüòã..The service was on point...The food were tasty and fresh for sure... Most importantly the staff were very courteous and friendly..The decor is edgy as well as classy... The ambience is nice and calm... The prices were very much pocket friendly (no additional taxes were charged) and it deserves to be visited again and again..
P.S They gave us candies as complimentary at the time of payment of the bill..

We ordered chicken periperi pizza, it was quite good and along with that French fries were in place of desserts cause it wasn't available. We took chicken garlic roasted and chocolate mug(shake). Above all, my experience was quiet good. But let me tell you that the restaurant has been shifted to shankuntala park just by the main road and it is no longer inside the Greenfield city.. Please note it down before you visit.

Worst , pathetic and disgusting. I had to wait 2 and a half hours to receive my order. The restaurant gave me bullshit reasons that they had too much pressure on them and Zomato people were taking more orders on their behalf. Zomato told me that restaurent is not responding to their calls. They were Blaming each other and it was me who suffered because of all these craps.

Ohh i have become a fan of this restaurant. A definite alternative to PHD and Dominos Pizza. As per Zomato, they are currently not delivering to my area, but as i have ordered more than a couple of times from this outlet, I directly called up the restaurant. A lady picked up and told me that its true that they are not delivering to my area due to some mishap with their main delivery guy but as I have called them up directly they can take a order which I found highly accommodating and considerate of her.

I ordered the following..

Mexican Mania Non Veg Pizza - Ohh boy, this was delicious with spicy sausages, cherry, tomato, paprika and jalape√±os.
Cajun Chicken Popcorn - This is was also good in taste, dont expect something like KFC Chicken Popcorns. These are much bigger in size and tastes differently and here different is good..It comes with a dip.
                    

Chicken Ham Burger and Peri Peri Chicken Burger - both were too good. I had the chicken ham one, it was awesome.
                    

This restaurant keeps amazing me with their amazing service and delivery. Delivered food to me hot and in time yesterday inspite of heavy rains.¬†

<I believe they have changed the burger breads which is not so soft - a point to be noted otherwise the chicken and ham patty were awesome>

They served me f****** undercooked chicken legs with blood on the bones!!! On top of that they argued it was sauce and later apologised!! F#%*. Not visiting Again!!!

Being a fan of pizza and having read positive reviews about Pizzeria House, I could not wait to order from here. So I ordered the Margherita pizza with extra cheese, and I was not let down at all. Not only was the pizza delivered well within 30 minutes from ordering, the crust was thin enough, hot enough and was laden with cheese all across its surface- just the way I like it. I want to thank Pizzeria House for making me such a pizza.

I'm a pizza person and by that I mean, I've had a lot of different types of pizza of different places. So by now I've acquired a distinct taste for good pizza.
Coming to this place, I didn't have much expectation because of its location and the ambience.

However, my dining experience was surprisingly good. After a lot of struggle in locating the place, this small yet cozy pizzeria did welcome us warmly. The staffs were cooperative and the fancy lights over each table was beautiful.

Coming to the menu, what amazed us was not only it's variety but also it's affordable price. The menu has been formulated very smartly, smart enough to impress any foodie.
We decided to go for Mexican exotica pizza of 10 inches and garden veggies pizza of 8 inches. Both were delicious. Thin crust, cheesy and exactly the way a good Pizza is supposed to be.
Also, they don't levy extra tax.

I'll surely visit this eatery again and looking forward to try their dessert section.

Have not been to this eatery in person, ordered for home delivery couple of times. I would recommend the foodies who have crave for western palette to try out theit in house special fish and chip - its one of the best in town and that also at very reasonable rate. In ddition i would also recommend to go for fried chicken leg pieces which tasted very yummy filled with juices and cheese inside, far better than KFCs. However the meat pizza did not meet my expectation in terms of bread quality and taste and their cheese macaroni fish lassagna tasted good, but the addons with ham did not taste fresh at all. Its true that the prices but you may expect delay in the delivery. During my last order, instead of 45 mins. they delivered after 2.5 hrs.

We ordered 8"Quattro stagino non veg pizza with thin crust through zomato. Honestly I wasn't expecting highly about it. But to my surprise the pizza was really great at it's price. Loaded with topping and cheese and we really loved it. It was flavorful and wholesome for two. Only downside would be the base. Well I can call it my own preference rather. I would like the thin crust base to be more crunchy that would elevate the flavors beautifully. Rest a thumbs up to overall quality and quantity.

The worst one can experience when ordering food online. Ordered through zomato many times in many different restaurants but never had to face something like this. The food arrived quite late even though the restu is not far from my place. The food was all cold.
Ordered russian salad which they have listed in veg. To my astonishment found chunks of chicken in my salad. Imgine a scenario where a vegeterian would have ordered this one. The salad had few or none of the ingridients mentioned and was full of cabbage. Quantity was far less than anything I have ever encountered in any place where I have ordered the same yet the price was higher than all.
Ordered chicken wings and wow, it was even a bigger disaster. Only water would taste more tasteless than those. Seemed like spices were used but it contributed to no taste. A total waste of money.
Never going to order from this place ever again and will advise my frinds not to.

I was looking for KFC for home delivery but found out it does not do so for our area. While looking for alternatives, I found this place on Zomato and ordered for ¬†Crispy Fried Chicken and Chicken Garlic Fingers. It turned out to be a wonderful choice as the Crispy Fried Chicken was too good...large chicken legs with a perfect fried coating. ¬†Much cheaper and more stomach filling than KFC. Good to see such a place in Behala. Would like to order some pizza the next time.

Ordered a large pizza (10" as they said) and desserts. Not up to the mark at all. If you have tasted other big pizza houses in Kolkata then this is just not the place for you. Blueberry cheesecake and chocolate brownies were the desserts I ordered and ended up eating sweets from local sweet shop. Being a foodie, I would suggest others to stay away from here unless they increase their food quality.

well guys, i must commit that the pizzas here are totally amazing, the best pizza could find in kolkata, ¬†pizza base is similar i tried in Italy and nowhere similar to pathetic dominos and pizza hut( the thick base hard to swallow from neck need plenty of water to slide in),, nevertheless Pizzeria house fulfilled my expectation the cheese and sauce used in pizza were in rhythm and rhyming the whole chemistry of gastronomy. need to try their burgers and other dishes ¬†as well.¬†
have to wait for the final rating, ¬†4 star rating as if now .

was craving for some pizza burger today so just ordered some! thanks to swiggy :D :D

menu - 1 Classic Chicken Cheese Burger with Adds ons: Extra Cheese & 8" Thin Crust Margherita Pizza with Extra Cheese

starting off.. Classic Chicken Cheese Burger was served with fries. the burger was good! it had 2 grilled chicken patty 2 slice of onions 2 slice of tomatoes and 1 big lettuce closed with mayo/cheese :v :D ^_^ <3 mine one had extra cheese it was attached to the chicken patty :D ^_^ <3
next... 8" Thin Crust Margherita Pizza it had Imported mozzarella, tomato sauce, basil. olive oil. it was okish! i had added extra cheese to it but it was not at all cheesy! :((((((((( the taste of the pizza was tangy cause of the tomato sauce given to it!

in overall it was a good experience and will order again soon to try out the other items :))))))))

The worst pizza ever ordered a margerita pizza it came after 100 mins the pizza was cold. The taste of the cheese was very bad. Guys dont waste your money in their pizza. The burger was bit good but not the pizza .

Placed an order through Zomato for a 'Margherita pizza' üçï (Imported mozzarella, tomato sauce, basil n olive oil) and 'Peri Peri fries'. üçü A charge of extra 30 bucks is applied if you choose veggie toppings with the pizza. The food arrived after more than the estimated delivery time of 90 minutes. As expected, the pizza was cold. The crust was thick and not sure what kind of pizza sauce was used that made it taste wierd. The quality of cheese seemed a far cry from what they enlisted as "Imported Mozzarella‚Äã". No signs of basil either. The more I dug into it, the lesser was the motivation to finish. To put it plainly, it was BAD. The fries tossed in chilli flakes were good.

Prices being extremely pocket friendly, the guilt factor was low üò∏ (bill came to around 230 bucks after applying the restaurant promo offer). A home delivery is NOT recommended and definitely NOT their Pizza!! üëéüëé

OK so I was planning to put d review on d night I visited this place.It was 14th Feb and I had a very rough and hectic day in my office so back home I was reluctant to go out. Bt it was Valentine's day and I guess love was sprinkled in d air (read my love for food hereüòäüòä)this place located 5 min walking distance from my house and it fitted d description of grabbing a bite real quick. So went there and placed d order :one napoletana lasagna (non veg ), one strawberry basil soda and one sizzling brownie.food was served within 15 min (on V day!! Recommendable!!).We tasted d lasgna first.it was cooked perfectly with right amount of lasagna sheet ,cheese and meat chunks.(I prefer more cheese though ‚ò∫) d frizzy drink was OK type and brownie tasted delicious .D host was warm to us through out our dinner. And yes I m visiting d place again for 2 reason : it is located near my house
Food is tasty there.Madhurima Nandy
P.s. this is d place I often visit for d delicious food

Located in between Shakuntala Park & Muchipara stoppage on the main road, can be easily located because on its big bright neon signage and see through glass partishioning.
This is a cafe in its true sense because of its varied menu and ambience too.
Decided to go for the 10 inch Carnivora Pitza & Strawberry Soda.Pitza was good in comparison to any QSR pitza as it was made fresh to a certain extent rather than assembled.Pitza base was just perfectly baked and uniform, concassey was perfect to taste and cheese was generously sprinkled.The only issue was with the meaty portion which I thought could not justify the name Carnivora, with dices of sausage and Salami. Over all a decent Pitza at Rs 450/- inclusive of tax & with condiments like Origano & Chilli Flex in sachet.Soda was ordinary to taste.
Thank fully it is table service and not pre paid self service.Decent place to spend an evening over little chatter.

Packing was excellent. Food delivered was not hot at all. Ordered peri peri chicken burger with add ons of extra cheese and salaami. Expected a lot more better quality of chicken patty inside burger. Choco fudge brownie was a bit hard. Fries were not at all crispy...they weren't hot. Had taken cheese fries separately but it wasnt different from the fries that came with burger...it was a normal fries with a dip which wasn't cheese at all. Shakes were awesome..loved them. One is berry mango shake and another is latte milkshake. Pizza was too cold to eat. Otherwise overall it's average.

I ordered a combo meal of chicken Mac and cheese, fries and brownie. It reached me bang on time and the price was very reasonable. Actually way too pocket friendly which was making me a little uneasy. After having the food I would say I am pretty satisfied. Although the thing that I was served in the name of Mac and cheese seemed more like a chicken pasta in bechamel sauce and the brownie was a little too hard for my taste. But I would say it's a good effort for this price.

‚Ä¢person who took order was not there the second time, we had to call the owner and give the order. 

Overall the restaurant is good. Nice place to hangout with friends. Food quality is good. I advice everyone to go for pizza its good. Though the restaurant is newly oppened so there was no ac and yes i hope they get one during summer.

Today I came to know that they have opened near shakuntala and can't resist my self to have a visit with my friends and it was really worth a visit.
