Cake is happiness! If you know the way of the cake, you know the way of happiness! If you have a cake in front of you, you should not look any further for joy.
You would certainly miss this extravagant, sensuous & lip smacking cake from Vanilla Bean if not tried already... I bet!!!

It's a tiny joint with pocket friendly baked stuff ....you wouldn't probably find nearby. I would recommend at least try once on this Christmas eve. Ciao!!!!
