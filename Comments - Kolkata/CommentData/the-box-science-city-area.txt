The Box is a great place to be when you’re looking for great tea and quick snack. Their is ample space to park your vehicle and sit & eat. The kesar chai and paw bhaji are good but I found the sandwich to be a tad bit too dry. However they take a lot of time to prepare the order when it comes to food. To end on a positive note, light on pocket and recommended for a quick bite.

The box is a tiny little shipping container which has metamorphised into a tea and snacks joint next to the bypass dhaba in metropolitan. Though the snacks are nothing to write home about it's value for money . The Kesar tea is a showstopper and the man behind the counter actually dresses the tea cup with a solitary strand of saffron. For 20 bucks a cuppa, betters most cafes in taste and price.

It was my day one in Kolkata when I had booked an Ola Rental and explored the city. After 3 hours of exploring, the driver told me to try this place.

Loved their tea while I did a take away of their samosa and jalebi. The jalebi was huge and very filling and tasted great too but was kind of disappointed with their samosa.

This place deserves 1 bcoz of it service and people working.
Went there with my friends. Staffs are very rude and poorly trained. Only tea was good. Owners do something about your staff.
I m sure owner doesn’t care for the review...

Location: On EM Bypass Just outside Bypass Dhaba.

This is a small joint with no seating space serving snacks such as tea,samosas,pav bhaji,sandwiches,sweets etc, it has become popular over the last few days because a lot of people gather around this place on evenings for tea and snacks.The tea is amazing and the other snacks also taste decent,the samosa is quite large in size and tasty.

Pocket Pinch is Low.

Overall a great place for evening snacks and tea.

This place is perfect for a nice cup of tea with few snacks options.

Good part is, you will get ample space for parking. Also useful for those waiting to get a place in bypass dhaba :).

Best items - Tea and pao bhaji.

God knows why this place has such a low rating here..🙄
Situated at Metropolitan, just beside Bypass Dhaba...u may have seen this outlet zillion times while passing by bypass. 😊
Their menu is not this one,which is added here in zomato..🤔
They have a big parking area in front of the counter, so u can just take ur food and sit on ur bike and enjoy the view of moving cars on the road.😊
They don't provide sitting arrangements, only few tools are there...u can sit if the place is not crowded. 😋 During the evening time it is mostly crowded. 😳

Ok so coming to their food, I have been here a number of times..while retuning from office.. 😛

1. Samosa.. Always served hot with red chutney. Really really tasty, tempting.,decent size, stuffed with filling and I just order one samosa everytime. 😍

2. Club kachori...5 small kachori will be served with potato curry, sweet chutney and chilli pickle. Again always served hot, tastes good...🤗

3. Khasta nimki...12 small round nimki for 20bucks, u can even pack for home,☺ which I always do...😝

4. Keshari jalebi...😘 Not too much sweet, and just perfect for me, give it a try...😇

5. Tea...they are always making tea, which is really 'karakh' , a keshari hint and refreshing it is always..😊

And they also have sandwich, pao bhaji and few more items in their menu...which I m yet left to try..🤔

I always find the foods fresh,tasty and hot, also really pocket friendly...😎

So visit this place whenever u are near to chingrighata area for a quick bite...,👍

great location.... ample car parking space and open till late are the only saving grace for this place.... right on EM BYPASS beside the metropolitan stoppage.... the decor and the shop outlook is unique for a roadside tea stall.... which sells tea in khullar or khullarwala chai as we call them.... alongwith some other stuff like samosa.... club kachori.... jalebi etc...  pretty quick service by a not so well behaved and customer centric staff.... the food taste is average to okaish.... but the price too is absolutely pocket friendly .... its a good location for a large grp hangout outside and thats why it stays pretty crowded.... nothing special otherwise....

Decent fast food etary just beside The Bypass Dhaba... Ambience was great... Décor is decent too... Service was fast... Staffs are not so well behaved... Tried their khasta kachori, singara n jalabi... All were decent enough... The place usually remins crowded during the evening... Pocket pinch is pretty alright...

Located on bypass adjacent to bypass Dhaba, this small kiosk is essentially a tea shop. Tried the kesaria chai here and it was absolutely delicious. Thry also serve snacks like samosa, kachoris, sandwiches and momo.
Prices are reasonable and there is ample parking to lounge in your car and sip on good tea. 

PROS-
Location, parking, price , quality 

CONS-
Less items in menu, no coolers or coffee, self service ( typical Indian talking here) 

Sorry for the bad quality pics.
