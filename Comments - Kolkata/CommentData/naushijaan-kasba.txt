It is a good small place located in kasba area..it serves mughlai cuisine at a more than average on a higher side..food was good but not total satisfying..heard abt it from many friends but its not up to the mark..I regard cooking is not the same everyday so I may try it some another day also..but for time being it is fairly good..the mutton keema biriyani which I ordered was not so good to my taste buds..so it's ok ok types for me..

The lucknow paratha and garlic naan were good, especially lucknow paratha, it melts in mouth. Also the shahi tukra was good but overpriced at 140/-. What i didnt like is mutton rezala, both the pieces were extremely bad, literally no meat in it, all bones and the gravy is not at least rezala, simply full of curd and lacks taste.

If you ever want to pamper your biryani taste buds in a grand manner, then you will have to visit Nausheejan! The ambience, the decor the food - WOW, its simply, 'Khandani Khana' The galauti kebab and the biryani were so well cooked and the mutton pieces so soft. I would highly recommend this culinary destination to all you foodies!

If I gave the rating only based on food, I'd have given it a 5. 
The location is good. The restaurant is small but cozy. But most of the time, because of the high demand of food here, you've to wait in queue. The service is also very slow.

Coming to the food, it will definitely be among the tastiest Biriyanis served in Kolkata. 

Must try: 
Handi Biriyani
Galawti Kebab
Mutton Pasinda

These are constants whenever I eat or order from this place.

Ordered Mutton Masala handi Biryani from this place. Truth be told I was a bit disappointed when the delivery guy handed me the handi which looked quite small. And I was told that the quantity would suffice one person and 300 bucks seemed a bit unreasonable compared to the quantity of food. However when I finally opened the handi and tasted a spoonful of its contents, I was left lost for words. The taste was extraordinary to say the least! I could feel the flavors exploding in my mouth. And I also found out that the quantity is actually good enough for two people if you are not planning to overeat. This was easily the best Biryani I have had in a long long time. Highly recommended!

I have never tasted a better Biriyani than the one served here. It can actually give competition to the other big Biriyani hubs in the city. Specially the dish that salivates your mouth is the Palak Biriyani which is the speciality. A great place to sit and have or do a take away to enjoy it’s delicious taste at home.

Their Keema Biriyani and normal Handi Biriyani is very good. Tender meat, moist and spicy rice but not too hot. All the good things of a good biriyani (except the aloo!)
Also try their mutton stew and kebabs. Worth a shot.

We have been ordering food (mostly Biryani) from Naushijaan for some time now. However, the last two experiences left me with no other option than to stop ordering from them. Our favourite was always the Handi Biryani. A couple of months back, we ordered it and found the Biryani to be extremely dry. We let it pass thinking that it might be an one-off event. Last Friday, we ordered again, this time Mutton Biryani and Their Special Biryani. Both were so hot and spicy we had to go hungry. I don't know if they would miss us, we will miss them.

We were a regular in ordering Naushijaan 's biryani and amazing spread of kebabs.. But a recent visit has taken us aback. It has been long since we had a naushijaan biriyani so we planned and went there on 5th sept 2017 and ordered for their famous Galauti Kebab and Mutton keema Biryani.  The taste was nowhere close to their original taste.. Where the upper crust of the galauti kebab was crispy fried which was killing a galauti kebab's taste and the biryani seemed more like mutton curry and rice mixed together.  My friend asked if their chef has changed and we came to know that the head chef has went to his village for Bakri Eid. We requested them to not serve Biryani if their original chef is not there. But the worst part happened next day.. when all our friends fell ill. We were suffering from food poisoning.  The taste was different not only because their head chef was not there but also they served us stale food due to lack of customers. Never going back to Naushijaan  again.  They lost their charm for sure.

The mouth-watering taste of their Lucknow Hazratganj restaurant can now be experienced in our very own city of soccer, food and "adda" as soon as you sample the "Handi Biryani", with virtually no trace of hydrogenated vegetable oil; long grain rice cooked to perfection with melt in the mouth pieces of mutton, boiled egg and the ubiquitous potato as found in Kolkata biryani - you simply cannot ask for more. They make one of the best, if not the best, Galawati Kebab in town. With two such signature dishes on their menu, Naushijaan has never compromised on the quality and standard since they opened their first Kolkata outlet. Just keep it up........

Located near Acropolis mall. Naushijaan serves very good quality awadhi biryanis. Their Naushijaan keema biryani, parda biryani, kofta handi biryani and specially nargisi kofta handi biryani are bliss. Though the biryani could have been a little less oily. But was great in taste. I loved the Naushijaan keema biryani,it had delicious marinated chicken keemas. The utensils and earthen pot they serve,had awadhi feel in it,would definitely impress you. But the interior is regular, doesn't suit with the beautiful name 'naushijaan'. I wonder why Naushijaan isn't a regular name among the biryani section of the city. Even the kababs were also great. We had lucknowi sheekh kababs. Will look forward to come to this place again and explore more.

Utterly disappointed..!
Worst biriyani I ever had..! Ordered handi biriyani. Was served in an earthen pot which itself is too small, the quantity was so minimal that it didn't even fill up half of the plate. A normal guy would need to order 3 such for a proper meal. I was so disgusted that I didn't even feel like taking a picture of the same.. Though I should have taken a snap and shared it for referrals. Quality is bad.. Really bad..even road side biriyanis tastes way better..! Will never visit again.

U can take your meal seating cozy in the dining area or take some pleasure of quick bites standing out viewing the busy traffic outside or get your food delivered at your residence, They have all the necessary arrangements for the same. We ordered two Chicken Sheekh Kabab Stuffed paratha. And my God it tasted GOOD!!! I'LL visit this place again to try meals.

An outlet located in Kasba, somewhere nearby Acropolis mall. The title "Naushijaan" mentioned at the door and the decor inside is a total opposite. A very nominal decoration with simple table-chairs, lighting & yes a flat-tv is only you would be able to see. When we visited it was entirely empty. We ordered for chicken & mutton biriyani. The taste was somewhat okay-ish. What I actually liked were the glasses in which they served water. It goes totally unexpected with other things. Service needs to be a little quick. 

P.S. The prices are mentioned with GST in their menu. So, while the bill is produced you don't get to see a 9% + 9% GST print.

If you are hungry & want some biriyani give a quick visit & grab a plate.

It's a small place near Acropolis mall. The decor is by no means impressive, but the food is. This was my second visit in around 5 years. We ordered the Galawti kebab and the Nasimjani for starters, the galawti kebab was good, sadly I cannot make the same comment about the later, which was ok. The main attraction here is the handi biryani, it was as good as I remembered it from when I my previous visit. If you happen to be in the neighbourhood and have a hankering for some biryani, I would suggest, you give this place a visit!

Outside view of hotel.. Name and small decor may impress you that you may get good food. 
One you enter first flood of the dining, its all like table and chair as we used to sit in tuition classes. 
Price of food printed in their menu card as including GST. 
Old AC and old decor won't make us comfortable. 
Never ever experienced such a worst Tengri Kebab in my life. And surprisingly waiter didn't how much pieces they used to serve in that menu. Later on, he told me that Tengri Kebab plater will have only three pieces and costs Rd. 260. Even a third class veg handi pulao which taste around home rice costs Rs. 240. Ordered chicken Rara which cost Rd. 330 for only 2 pieces. Very bad experience. Not a tasty food. 
Pls avoid this foodies.

WORST experience ever I had in any restaurant in Bengal. Abysmal food quality, pathetic taste and irrational pricing, it stands for simply money looting and cheating the customer.

Chicken Biryani (Home Delivery) was ordered on Saturday Evening, what we received was a great disappointment. Biryani was like any roadside stops served in a pot or even worse. Two finger-thin dry chicken piece, no egg, one half boiled small size potato piece that’s all.

 It is sad that the quality of food was so bad along with the price point.Not going back their again.

The restaurant is located near acropolis mall , opposite to Frank Ross pharmacy .It was a few days back when I first ordered their CHICKEN PARDA BIRYANI (as I was excited by the name 😅). Definitely a unique dish as the biryani was in earthen pots and the pots were very well packed. The very first glimpse of the dish after removing the foil was something which i had never seen , the fragrant biryani ,half covered with a thick gravy .
Now, The taste: For biryani lovers this dish can be seen as very good or sometimes okayish good . Well for me this dish was just a notch higher than good .
The rice was very well cooked in spices and was definitely aromatic but was just lathered in ghee because of which the overall dish seemed a bit heavier than normal biryani. The chicken pieces can be rated a 3.5 and had a good taste. It's a type of biryani in which the deeper you dig , the better it gets . It's different from a Bengali biryani and hence one must try if he/she wants a "hatke" biryani.

Naushijaan's Handi Biryani is one of the best Biryanis I have tasted in recent times. I would rate them just after Arsalan and Aminia. Yet,  the rich aroma of rice in Naushijaan's Biryani is amiss in the dish offered by these two iconic eateries too. 

For me,  Biryani means mutton. Chicken Biryani is poor man's Biryani and Veg Biryani is an oxymoron. And Naushijaan excels in Mutton Handi Biryani. The rich texture of rice,  succulent pieces of mutton and alu can drive any faint hearted crazy. Of course, the Chicken Biryani is nice too. 

For sides with Biryani,  you can go for Mutton Boti or Chicken Boti. If you want to keep it light,  go for their Rezala. 

Naushijaan also offers Parda Biryani,  which contains Palak. I am yet to experiment with this one. 

Sitting area is limited,  so I would suggest you to go for takeaway or delivery.  You wont regret it.

Do not remember eating at any place worst than this. Chicken Handi Biriyani was worst than those we get on the street side. 2 pcs of chicken which they provide in the Biriyani is miniscule. Looks like Kauwa Biriyani. OMG they don't even know how to prepare Mutton Pasinda ! Served Mutton Boti Kebab & claimed it to be Pasinda. Horrible ! Any food lover will be utterly disappointed & irritated. Zomato doesn't allow, otherwise would have given Negative Rating.

Searching for quality biryani? This is the place. Located near Acropolis Mall, Kasba they have a small seating area in the 1st floor and you might not be impressed by the decor or the ambience. I usually order for a takeaway. One thing that is a very big downside of this place is the cleanliness. They have​ earned quite a bit of popularity due to the delectable Biryani they serve but these are the aspects which needs to be paid attention to. Since, also, they charge quite a sum for the dishes, they have to level it up to live upto the expectations of the visitors. Biryani is the only thing that'll make u forget all this. Their Handi Biryani is what I adore completely. A taste that remains even after u have finished off. Serves two. I also tried the Naushijaan Biryani which has a completely different taste from the usual Biryani that u have hence makes their speciality. It has a spinach base. Those who love palang, will surely fall in love with this dish as I fell.

The place looks beautiful from the outside and is located right on the main road. Super easy to locate. Have been there only once, but have ordered takeaways quite a few time. I have had the mutton handi biryani, galawti, chicken tangri, mutton bhuna, paneer butter masala and ofcourse the normal chicken and mutton biryani.

Out of everything I have tried the mutton handi biryani and the galawti are my absolutely favourite. Both tasted amazing. 

I wish I could say the same about the rest of the dishes though. The paneer was on the sweeter side which i hated, the biryani was quite dry and was nothing reminiscing about. The tangri was soft and succulent but did not quite impress me. Overall the prices are quite reasonable and you could definitely give it a go if you happen to be in that area.

A name that brings you back to the old city of lucknow and the mughals, this restaurant is on the busy main road of Kasba just before the Acropolis mall.... upon visiting i noticed that the owners definitely tried to create an ambience thru creative interior designing but were unable to maintain it.... we took the stairs to the first floor and the inside was a small but cosy ambience again.... we were seated and given the menu card.... but once we ordered we had to cancel it in 2 mins..... the place was full of houseflies.... so much that you typically see in para sweet shops..... it was a big put off and so much so that we decided to leave..... other customers too were dissapointed but i was skeptical about the hygiene standards.... i mean i love roadside food and its not hygienic at all but i dont have that expectation either.... over here,  i wonder if the open area is not kept clean,  how dirty wud be the kitchen.... the 2 points are given solely on the effort to give an ambience.... they gotta do something about this sooner than later coz hygiene should be one of the biggest factors to visit or not to visit a place....

We used to love their biriyani but recently when we ordered food from there it was a great disappointment. We ordered garlic nan,  butter nan,  kakori kabab and chicken korma. All of them,  I repeat all of them was just awful. The nans were chewy,  saltless. Chicken korma was full of oil and taste was not also satisfying. And what to say about kakori kabab..I have never tasted such bland food in my life. We could not finish also all four pieces. 
Overall very disgusting experience and we have decided not to order from here again.

Today I visited Naushijaan for the first time and though it was highly recommended, the decor didn't strike as very polished. But my first impression changed when the Galauti Kebab, Jugalbandi kebab and the lachchha parathas arrived. It did live up to it's reputation when it came to the quality of food. The handi biryani didn't disappoint either. Overall a nice and affordable place to have a nawabi experience!

The food perse is not too bad but not consistent in their quality either. Some are good while others are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Their kebabs are tasty and good. The paratha are okayish. While for veggies it's not at all good!!

Pathetic service. This is the first restaurant which got such bad rating for me ofcourse for a reason. We hit this place on 20th May. Place was totally empty we 3 were the only people in the restaurant with a manager and server. We finished our food paid the money and they shut down all the acs and fan and left the place in this hot clumsy room. We even had to slide the door to get in and out. 

Heard a lot about this place but turned out to be flop.Food was very average. Biriyani was like any roadside stops served in a pot. Chicken lahori was nothing but a tandoori chicken afghani was same as chicken reshmi kabab.

Naushijaan is charging 14.5% vat against take away  which I think that they are cheating customers....Why a customer has to bear 14.5% vat over take away food? 
Actually all restaurants are taking huge taxes over the food bill where customers unknowingly have to bear and on the other side if someone challenges any restaurant they are also unable to answer....

I have gone to this place many a time. I have also availed take away and home delivery. Good things first - their biriyani is among the best in town. Handi biriyani is a must have. Among the kebabs, do try the Boti or the Galawati. They are simply awesome. The rest of the stuff are common to most restaurants. For desserts, try the Firni.. it's quite good. Now the not so good things or improvement areas - the ambience. This is a spoiler. That's why I prefer to bring the stuff home. The service is also a bit slow. However, take away counter is pretty fast. One final comment - the preparations are a bit oily! It tastes good though!!!

We ordered Biriyani, a side dish of chicken, one side dish of mutton and firni.
The food is nothing special but yes much better than Dhaka Biriyani and others. The rice of the Biriyani was very soft and was easily melting in my mutton leaving this wonderful taste.
The ambience is nothing special. It's average.

Was thinking of ordering from Naushijaan for a long time & finally made it. Not much, just ordered Lachha paratha and Chicken Handi Korma. The paratha was thin and crispy fried not like other places where the parathas are made so thin that you can't even finish a single paratha. The Korma preparation was well prepared but only with 2pcs of chicken and that also of not big size, the price is little bit on the higher side. This little things should be considered for their own good.

Biriyani has proved its worth in Kolkata for ages now. Be it any occasion biriyani is something which sticks almost at the top of the list. Needless to even say that the popularity of this dish in Kolkata has reached places outside Kolkata and in some cases even abroad and because of some restros like this that the spirit still lives on. Before I start I want to state that this review is based totally on food quality, taste, and obviously quantity. 

Coming to the decor, the place looks quite basic yet not shady. There is much less to speak about the decor as it is like five others in Kasba. The seating is somewhat comforting still there were rooms for improvement.

Coming to the quality of the food, well just one word can describe it "fabulous". I tried their biriyani and for sometime just got lost in the fabulous and yes... that exact taste. Well the biriyani was oily a bit but hey !!! that's a real common factor in Kolkata, especially kolkata biriyani. Along with this tried the mutton Pasinda but that was a bit of a turn down as it was a bit too much of a combination of dalda and oil. But the biriyani beats all odds. Served in handi it was something.. to have back at home. The quantity was enough for one person but again quantity is something which depends on how much you can take.

Well coming to staffs I found them quite up to the mark. The food was ready and packed in as much time as expected. Definitely recommend this place for their fabulous biriyani...

The Biryani is a new type, which i liked. The sitting area is a little shabby. Waitstaff is good , at least they are helpful. The hygiene conditions are not great as i could see flies and small cockroaches in and around. Menu cards are worn out. Parking is a issue as you have to park on the road. Pricing is at par with other Biryani joints. Takeaway is a great option from this place.

Delicious variants of biriyani. My favourites are Mutton Handi Biriyani....comes in a earthen pot or Handi, with a subtle smell and taste of ghee.
This biriyani is completely different from what you usually get in normal biriyani stores.

Kofta biriyani: Served like the Handi biriani but has
 4-5 meat balls instead. Spicy and tasty .

Ambience: 1/10

This place doesnot look too impressive from outside but when you actually indulge into the food it offers it is definitely worth spending. The Handi Biriyani they offer you has a pleasant smell the biriyani rice melts inside you giving you a feeling that craves for more of it. The kabebs are amazing too specially Galwati Kabeb. The only backdrop being the interior and the exterior. Otherwise it gets a thumbs up 👍for food  lovers.

If its only biriyani, (being a fanatic biriyani lover, will write only bout biriyani, though the gelauti kebabs were equally good), naushijaan is as good as it gets. I love it when your biriyani is not overdone and just melts in your mouth. This is just that. Loved it. The interior needs to be worked on and should be better.

One can easily locate the place.. Nothing new with the ambiance, just too simple and not going with the name itself no lucknowi feeling at all... It was full empty when we entered till the time we left I guess because it was a busy thursday.. I heard alot about this place but too my surprise the menu, so very ordinary just like any road side food corner.. We ordered Lahsuni kebab and one more kebab (forgot the name) in starters, Handi egg biriyani and lucknowi paratha along with chicken korma (forgot the exact name).. Kebabs are well textured and it also tasted good. Same goes for  the biriyani but the lucknowi paratha was a total loss...  As this was our first time we asked for suggestions from the staff serving our table and there we did a mistake.. Its better to prepare urself before going rather than asking for such suggestions which may turn into a big MISTAKE !!!

The Handi Biriyani is the only good thing about this place amidst a host of issues. Service is terribly slow, the place is shabby and it could get really hot in the corner due to the inefficiency of air conditioners. 

I liked the Mutton Boti but its under-cooked Chicken counterpart was a disappointment. Recommended for people in pursuit of good quality and different Biriyani with a good amount of time in hand for the orders to be carried out. Much better option as a takeaway joint.

For the starter both the lasuni kebab & the malai tikka kebab had e very toothsome.the handi chicken biriyani was served in a clay pot.it was nice in taste but the portion of the chicken was slightly dry though it tend to be juicy.bharta & the chicken boti were nice & the firni was delicious.pricing was acceptable.bill was being done without charging the service charge.only thing was that both the boti & bharta tasted so indistinguishable.parkibg can be done infront of the restaurant.

A decent restaurant and a good ambience. If ambience is your aim you can go there. I had chicken handi biryani and chicken tikka masala. The tikka masala tasted good but the biriyani was normal as u get else where. Therefore it was not upto the mark of paying 220+taxes for each biriyani. Overall it was a okay experience, waiters behave well and you can surely try it out

If you are a biryani lover, this should feature in your wishlist! Their handi biryanis with spinach gravy is super amazing. Kebabs are good too! However they should thrive on improving their service consistency. Last time we visited, they served stale fish kebabs!

If good ambience is what you expect then this is an absolutely no-no! Home delivery/ Take-away is a much better option.

This place doesn't really stay up to its reputation. When you talk about Naushijaan you expect to get Awadhi/Lucknowi kind of food. Well I did hear about this place from a friend of mine and had ordered Mutton Kofta Biryani on a couple of ocassions and my God I was surprised to receive my order on a clay handi. Also the Biryani was quite good but quantity wise it was less. Also the prices of Biryani here is too high. The other two weeks back I order simple Chicken Biryani and it was simply an awful experience. The chicken inside was a small piece from the leg portion and it was totally fibrous. Rice quantity was half and overall the Biryani simply didn't have almost any Biryani masala. Totally dry. Moreover at the time of ordering the food, the person I spoke with I clearly mentioned my requirement and he was so rude and was not interested in taking the order properly. They charged me 180 bucks with taxes and that too for this shitty Chicken Biryani. Well after my previous two experiences I felt that this is the place to have good tasty Biryani and I felt disgusted after this experience.

My honest suggestion to people visiting or ordering food from here. Please visit at your own risk. Very disappointed....Thumbs Down for this place.

# Mutton Handi Biriyani : Gravy, made of spinach paste
# Chicken Naushijaan Biriyani : served with egg and potato

What we ordered - 

Starters: Jugalbandi kabab, Galouti kabab, Pasinda kabab, Hariyali kabab
Main course : Handi Biriyani, Chicken Dumpukht
Dessert : Shahi Tukra

Every item was good. But special mention goes to the kababs , which were excellent.

Overall, a must try for lovers  of mughlai cusine.

Located on the main road of Kasba Connector, this is a two-storeyed restaurant. The restaurant has a very shabby appearance. Don’t even think of stepping in here if you are of those who sees the ambiance of the restaurant and decides if he wants to go there or not. Infact I would say it’s more on the dirty side.

They supposedly specialise in Lucknowi food but I found the food to be pretty average. I don’t understand why this restaurant is so hyped. Everything was pretty normal. Trust me when I say you can find much better restaurant with a better ambiance than this one.

However, I have to say this, the service was very slow even at the time the restaurant was deserted. The waiters were very unprofessional and we literally had to shout to call them. 

Not an ideal experience worth recommending.

I have ordered food from this restaurant some days ago. I must say they serve very good food . We ordered biriyani kebab and cchiken chap . All the items are tasty. Biriyani is very good and it was less spicy. Must try this place.

This is a much hyped food joint, that I visited with my cousins on a weekend for dinner. We went to this place based on the recommendation of our friends. The mutton kebab was horrible, so stiff.. The handi biryani was too dry. Lastly, the service was very very slow.

Location: Nabapally.

Don't get fooled by the rusty and dusty exteriors. This place is perfectly decorated and has shiny interiors. The big wooden hoarding adds to the charm.

I came here to have a go at their much talked about "sheek kebab roll".

While you wait for your order, watch how they grill kebabs in front of you and take in the beautiful smell of mughlai food.

The sheek kabab was made and wrapped around in a rumali roti.
Frankly, in my opinion, the quantity of kebab was very less and was very basic in taste. It lacked a complex flavour profile which should be there in a kebab. The roll was pretty thin and ₹140+ not justified for that thin piece of roll.

*Photos coming up pretty soon*

Nashijaan should totally patent their Handi Biryani.  It is so nice and rich that writing about it just doesn't do justice to it. The galauti kebabs are also the closest to thw ones in Lucknow that I have had here in the city.

Not very lucknowai taste but must say it's a good try! Biryani tastes good too. They have tried to do a good job with the kebabs and when you are away from lucknow this much is sort of ok and deserves a thumbs up..! All the best and good going!

An old favorite. Had ordered for home delivery via Swiggy which came quite fast. The mutton handi biriyani was really nice, as was the galauti kababs. But the chicken chap can be better. Still overall is good value for money and am experience we would want more of.

Okay, so went on a Dussera day. Biriyani was pathetic and spicy though the presntation was appealing, wherein they serve in a matir hari. The gentleman who was taking the order seemed to be an amateur and not of much help while placing our order. Chicken Chap was edible, service is slow considering we were the only guests along with another couple. Overall not happy to pay 700 odd bucks for average biriyani , chap, salad, cold drinks and couple of rumali rotis.

We went there for lunch. The place was quite small. But,the services were poor. We had to wait 15 minutes to give our order. Though it was not overcrowded. And the lunch came 45 minutes after... Only thing was good the quality of foods. Every dishes were perfectly cooked. Chicken and mutton naushijan biriyani was a special one. It tastes so good. Chicken tikka masala tasted good. The lucknow paratha was okk. I hope you upgrade ur services.

Came here with great expectation to taste their handi biriyani. First of all ambience is not at all good.We ordered masala handi biryani.....the taste was different from normal kolkata biryani but not that much good. Quantity was sufficient for 1 person.
Now the con is the price.....I just couldn't figure out how a normal tasted biryani with quantity for 1 person in a restaurant where ambience is also bad can be priced so high. With tax masala handi biryani price was approx 300. So who will want try this place 2nd time... when we can easily get good biryani from arsalan ,aminia etc within 200. If a dish is priced high their taste must be also good..like in oudh 1590 the price is high but the food is also superb. So Naushijaan dissapointed me... will not come again further....

I have previously heard a lot about their biriyani which I am yet to taste. But had the opportunity to taste their sheek kabaab and their ruti rolls. The kabaabs were, Perfectly spiced, juicy and succulent.The ruti roll was something that simply floored me. Will surely try their biriyani in future.

5 for the food .. 2.5 for seating and ambience .. chicken tikka masala was different from the usual fare..it was good .. however the galawati kabab steals the show .. it's a brilliant kabab made of minced mutton and it will surely leave a lingering taste in ure mouth .. also special mention of the Lucknow paratha. It was good as well .. however the ambience could have been much better for a place with such high standard of food .. highly recommended

I had been hearing rave reviews about this place for the longest time, but was sorely disappointed when we went for dinner. We ordered Mutton burra kebab, Mutton handi biryani & Mutton Naushijaan biryani. It was all downhill 🙁
First of all the place is very shabby and needs upkeep, next there was only 1 waiter to take orders as well as serve! The wait time is almost 30 mins and there was only one more family eating.
The food was just not worth the wait or the money. The kebab was not soft and quite bland, the signature biryani was watery and tasteless, the handi biryani was just about ok. For the price the quantity is way too less as well...
Definitely never going back!

We ordered 3 Mutton Handi Biryani and 1 Chicken Handi Biryani about a week back. The biryanis came in a clay pot with 2 small pieces of mutton/chicken, 1 pc. of potato (aloo). The good thing is it has an aroma of clarified butter (ghee). The portions are normal (good for one person) and it doesnt taste anything exceptional to justify the price tho.Now regarding this particular order, it was placed at about 11pm and the order was delivered at about 12:30am. We opened it at about 1am and 2 of the mutton biryanis were absolutely stale and stinking. We tried calling the restaurant that night and the obviously phone got answered. We called them in the morning and complained. They asked us the bring the stale biryani the next day. We told her that we obviously didnt keep the stinking biryani to rot at home. The madam on phone told me she would investigate and come back to me. I asked her over phone and also smsed her that, its okay that a food delivered so late can go bad and asked her for a replacement. I called the restaurant the consecutive days and none of the concerned person were available. I waited for a week for her 'investigation' and a mere replacement. Till date I havent heard from them.Its not about the 450 bucks (tho it is a lot of money) we spent for 2 biryanis, but when a restaurant gets popular it should not give cold shoulder to their customers. To keep the brand on top you have to keep your customers happy and rectify your mistakes!

Ordered Handi biriyani and Parda biriyani. Handi biriyani was good. Mutton was good. Overall taste was good but not as exotic as it sounds. Compared to normal biriyani, it was average. Parda biriyani was a big disappointment. Capsicum in a biriyani is just not done. Overall, the price to portion is a bit let down as well.

The way the food is presented is good. Handi biryani comes in a clay pot covered, gives it a good look. Coming to the taste, its nothing very exquisite or unique its a very common taste. It is very oily and has a lot of scent. The biryani comes with two mutton and one aloo. Mutton pieces are small. Quantity is very less. The only thing I liked was the clarified butter which was used which gave a good taste and fragrance.

Heard a lot about this place for its yummy biriyani... Finally I went to this place with my friend few months back... From outside the place is not very attractive but they compromise on the food. 
The decor was very simple and the ambience was good.
We had chicken kabab and handi biriyani.. Both were yummy. The kabab was soft and juicy. The biriyai was obviously different from the other biriyanis of the city though its a bit oily. Overall I liked the food. Few days back I ordered two biriyani via the zomato delivery app. They were half an hour late.

After the interview at the Passport offc at Anandapur, chose this place to have lunch with my family. It was nearly 3 when I called up to ask whether they're serving lunch then.
Placed order at 3.30pm and the food came at 3.45pm. The service boy told wrong names for the side dishes and was alone, so the service wasn't good enough, gets 5.5/10. I feel that their quantity in every dish are less.
Ambience(7/10): Can accommodate 25-30 max at a time. Dimly lit, the lights hung from the ceiling look authentic but are very dirty to be honest.

Orders: 
4 Mutton Handi Biryani
1 Chicken Boti
1 Chicken Tikka Masala
2 Firni(packed)
**Review**
Mutton Handi Biryani(8/10): The quantity isn't for 2 normal people to share, else could have given a 9. The flavors in the potato was sheer taste. The Mutton was moist and cooked to perfection. Each grain of rice was coated in the spices and ingredients of the dish, evenly. They could have given a bit more for Rs 220.

Chicken Boti(6.5/10): This was also a pretty decent dish. Had several small pieces of chicken.The quantity is enough for two, if you take only 1 type of side dish. The pieces of chicken were soft and wonderfully cooked and the flavors in of the ingredients will sprout in your tastebuds. 

Chicken tikka Masala(7.5/10): This was a better preparation than chicken Boti but it had 5 pieces which I found pretty odd, generally restaurants have 6 pieces in these. The Chk Tikka was palatable and is worth your time and money here, don't miss this out. The spices used in this dish makes it wonderful.

Firni(8/10): The quantity wasn't as good as Arsalan or Shiraz but tasted definitely better than them. Soft and accurately sweetened and not , rock hard. 

Service(5.5/10): There was only one person in service and he was unable to handle 2-3 tables separately all by himself, so the service was slow. The hands dried up by the time he brought in the water for washing hands. Wrongly named the side dishes. Was going to serve both the sides one after the other even though there was no place on the plate.

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES, EXPERIENCES AND WAYS OF JUDGING EACH RESTAURANT. DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR A BETTER CONCLUSION. KEEP EATING.

I have always been inquisitive about this place..as a lot of people had a lot of contradicting anecdotes to share about it. Some said the restaurant is 'all gloss, no good', while others said that the Mughlai cuisine on offer here rivals the very best in the town..
I happened to walk past this restaurant recently on a balmy July evening with a friend, and suddenly had a brainwave.. Why not give this outlet an earnest try?
I walked in without any pretensions..but the menu card didn't exactly ameliorate my mood by any stretch of imagination..The prices were all staring northwards.. Even the normal kabab dishes, which I prefer to devour for starters were pricier than expected.. And they serve 5 kababs instead of the more-accepted 6, mind you..
We settled for Chicken Banjara kabab, Lucknowi paratha, Mutton pardah biryani and a chicken gravy dish ( sorry can't recall the name, what difference does it make any way? ;-) ) . To be fair, the fair, the food was fairly edible.. though it took quite some time to make it to our table. The Biryani was moist, gooey and unlike most other versions that you get across the city.. The parathas were wafer-thin (perhaps that is how you distinguish it as Lucknowi) and good to munch into, while the kababs and the chicken gravy dish, while being delicious enough, weren't too different from the other outlets in the city.
The biggest letdown though, was the quantity.. When you shell out so much for a plate of Biryani, you cannot be blamed if you expect it to be sufficient for two people.. The Lucknowi parathas were a tad too 'Lucknowi' (read- thin), and we had to order an extra helping of it to make sure we didn't go back only partially satiated..
After listening to all the contradictory stories from my friends about this place, I had decided to pay a visit and come to a conclusion myself. The sad part is, I am still to come to something conclusive about this place.. the contradictions are so very apparent..
Wouldn't be a risk you would regret too much though, so give it a try if you are bored of the sameness of your regular Biryani .. :-)

NB:
Give their kebabs a try.

This was one of the many biriyani places which was in my long wishlist. We ordered a handi biryani and Naushijaan special chicken biriyani. Handi biryani was full of flavors and spices. But the other was something I had never had before. It didn't taste so good. But the handi biryani was there to compensate for this one. :P

It was during the Ramadan Walk organised and arranged by the Panch Phoron group, when Naushijaan was in our list. 
Located in Kasba, just a little ahead of Acropolis Mall towards Gariahat, so it is quite easily locatable.
We were a group of seven people who visited the restaurant during the Haleem Walk of Ramadan. The entrance is marked by the wooden textured board with the name Naushijaan on it, the kitchen area and the cash counter is downstairs just at the entrance itself. The restaurant is upstairs, and a staircase decorated on the side with colored bulbs and lanterns and show pieces, takes us there. A multicolored and intricately designed sliding door opens to the restaurant. Marked for its Mughal-like decor, intricately designed and colour-textured ceiling, with lamp shades hanging from the ceiling over each table, big windows and the panes being painted in white completely were in contrast and complementing the colored ceiling, the dark brown wooden furniture, the steel plates, amd water being served in steel glasses with copper-plated body, everything culminated together gave a complete traditional feel that one will enjoy. 
For food, we had ordered two Mutton Haleems, Roomali Roti alongwith it, Chicken Kebabs and Aloo Kebabs.
The Mutton Haleems were served in copper plated bowls, the quantity given was good enough, the gravy was thick, and the mutton pieces were well blended in the gravy. With finely chopped onions and coriander leaves and an added lemon slice, completely enhanced the taste of the Haleem. It was quite good. The Roomali Rotis were good in size as well, and soft.
The Chicken Kebabs were decent enough. Quantity served was fair.
The Aloo Kebabs was something very interesting, and I had it for the first time. There were potato scoops and they were stuffed, tasted really good. Loved it!
Well, the prices are okay too, taxes are levied on the total bill.
I also visited the place a second time on the Eid day, was alone and had my Eid lunch here. I had ordered for a handi Mutton Biryani, which came in an earthen Handi. Quite suffice in amount, it had two mutton pieces and a potato. The rice was soft, the mutton pieces were tender and perfectly blended in the biryani masala. I loved the taste. And it completely complements its pricing.
The staffs are friendly and knows what their customers want! 
Good place! 😊

We only ever had take-outs from this place, honestly. So I cannot really comment on how the interiors of the place is and such. 

But the FOOD. Oh my goodness! 

We were floored. We tried their Mutton Handi Biriyani and Special Chicken Biriyani from the take-away menu. 
Both came in earthen pots, pipping hot and smelling absolutely divine. 

The Mutton Handi Biriyani is a rich concoction of rice and meat cooked in delicious spices and ghee. Every morsel flooded our mouths with its flavour. Moist rice, smelled of calorified butter and saffron. The Mutton, tender and soft, almost falling off the bones. Two chunky pieces of Mutton and the quintessential potato in a decent sized portion of rice. 

The Chicken Special Biriyani came with an egg, a potato and a HUGE piece of chicken. The flavour of this dish is unique. They use a coriander-basil spice mix, which creates quite an interesting flavour and found favour with us. 

The portion size is adequate, let's say two Biriyanis are good for three people. 

Pocket Pinch: Economical.

If you are  looking for clean flavours and not the rich spicy awadi food you should drop in for a meal at Naushijaan. There are some interesting range of birayanies and I like the one which comes with a kofta which is an egg covered with either chicken or mutton.  Try the pasinda roll. The kababs are moist and tasty lovely to taste. The restaurant is not too big and the decor although improved needs working on the AC but that must be a temporary problem

Located on Ruby Ballygunge junction, Naushijaan serves authentic mughlai cuisines.Went there couple of days back with a friend specially to try the Galawti kebabs and Nawabi Panje . The dishes were cooked well and tasted super with parantha. Apart from food the ambience didn't impress me much because its quiet ordinary and the place is also small with an arrangement for around 7 to 8 tables. People who prefer food and ambience together might think once before going to this place but if u are a die hard mughal cuisine person then don't dare to miss this out.

Very disappointed with the quality of food. 
The only thing which was good were the kebabas : chicken kaalimirch tikka, really yummy. 
Coming to the mains! Complete let down. Chicken biryani was not tasty and the handi mutton biryani had a strong flavour of ghee. Completely ruined it.
The restaurant had a lot of bees , plates were not very clean. 
However Service was very friendly but slow.

I had tasted kebabs and biryani from Naushijaan in 2014. We had packed for home galauti kebab, mutton kebab wrapped in chicken (I've forgotten its name) and most probably kofta biryani (or keema biryani; the dish had balls of minced mutton in it). The kebabs tasted fabulous. But I still remember in the biryani, the minced mutton meatballs were so soft, it got scattered. The rice was too spicy. The biryani was packed in earthen handis, which added a special aroma to it. Two years later, yesterday, we again packed dinner from here and were surprised to see that the charges for each dish were almost the same as 2014. We had kakori kebab, Nawabi punjey, mutton handi biryani and firni. Let's begin from the end. The firni was utterly disappointing. Though it had a light yellow colour (suggesting saffron in it), the taste was not the restaurant can take pride in. Even the quantity was very little if compared to the price. Then the mutton handi biryani, packed in earthen handis. Three full plates served four of us very well. Though the mutton pieces were not much impressive, the light taste of the biryani managed it. And lastly the kebabs. They were purely bliss. Both of them felt like the most soft and succulent meat we've ever had. The kakori kebab was mutton minced to form sticks, cooked with curd and spices which would melt in your mouth while you enjoy its heavenly tatse. The nawabi punjey was mutton rib portions cooked in spices. I've never had such soft piece of mutton in my life. Will surely visit again, but only for the kebabs.

Have been coming here since the day it opened shop. The place seems to have gotten better with time including the décor though the chairs are uncomfortable as ever. The food has always been USP here and the kebab s with parathas are a must have. The biriyani served in sealed earthenware is very different from your usual Kolkata variety. Had the haleem here last night but wasn't a fan, the mutton pieces were just too chunky . Go for kebabs and biriyani in pocket friendly prices.

Interior is basic. Do not keep high expectations when it comes to the decor/ambiance. 2.5/5.

The staff seem to have a laid back attitude. Service: 3/5.

Food: 3.5/5. Mostly I've had home deliveries. Try their signature Handi Biryani, Chicken Handi Korma. 

Portion: Okay. Price: Reasonable.

The place does not look much from the outside,but if you are a biriyani lover it is a must visit. Here you will find the Lucknowi biriyani which is much different from the other varieties available in the city. The aroma of pure ghee and spices is to die for. The biriyani is very light as well. Do try their galouti kebab and shahi tukra as well. You will not be disappointed.

This restaurant is full of problems, the cramped interiors, the service (or the lack thereof) and the food. Ghee-ish Biryani, flimsy parathas, bland gravies. The only saving grace is that the meat is succulent and tender, be it in the biryani or the gravies. Overall this is a mediocre eatery trying too hard to be something it is not.

Located nearly Kasba Nabapally bus stand just opposite to my house.. Ambiance and Decor is nothing as such. I have been visiting this joint from the first day onwards..... I cant suggest you to go over there as the cooking is not consistent and the service is just awful. 

The size of the Handi Biryani was Rs 150 now they have risen that same size Handi to Rs 220. They have waived of  the large Handi and If you do have any  complain about the food also they wont listen to you also....

I can over look everything , the ambience the service just to have the masala handi biryani. I found the food yummy. If ur bored of having the conventional biryani u should actually try out the Naushijaan  masala handi biryani. And if ur looking for ambience and excellent service then u can might as well try for some 5 or 7 star hotel. I love experimenting when it comes to food, and with it if i get good ambience and service thats a bonus.

Since this place is located at Kasba, me and a couple of friends thought of paying a visit to this place as it falls on our way back from college. We were extremely excited as we had heard rave reviews of its food. Once we entered the building we were a little taken aback. The outside was nothing extraordinary and interior was equally disappointing. It was very basic but that is okay since it is food what holds the highest pedestal. 😛 So we ordered a plate of galauti kabab and 2 plates of handi biryani ( for which it is most known). The service was bad as they did not pay attention to our requirements. There was just one more family in the entire restaurant apart from us and the waiters didn't bother coming to attend us for the next 10 mins. The food came within 20-25 mins which is okay. The galauti was fantastic, completely melted in our mouth. However the biryani was disappointing and less in quantity. Price is on the higher end. I'd recommend to order for home delivery instead of going there in person. Believe me, you won't be missing out on anything.

After hearing much about their Handi Buryani served in earthen pot (Handi) we a few in office decided to give it a try and ordered for delivery...
The delivery was faster than we expected...
Food-Even Biryani and Galawti Kebab was very well prepared and the best part is a hand i can be easily shared by two with small and tender pieces of mutton we cooked and juicy...the Galawti Kebab was cold but tasted good and as we forgot to order rotis so we had it with breads which was there in our office fridge 😁...
This place can surely be recommended to friend's...

Decent.
That's one word to describe the place. At a good location but with a good amount of competition around it. It takes a lot of heart to open another mughlai joint, with a simple menu and prices on the higher side, but then they are different. And that is what will make them stay.

It was around 4pm today when we reached the place. 4 of us including my veggie friend. The exteriors are nicely done. We were ushered inside to the first floor. It was completely empty. They have decorated it really well. Given it a classy touch with lamp shades on top of each table, the copper cutlery, glass water bottle, air conditioned and the glass panel which gives a view of the road. The ambiance impressed us.

The order comprised of Handi biryanis (a mutton and a chicken) and Masala Handi Pulao(veg). All of these came in earthen pots or handi, as they are known, well sealed, quantity enough or a hungry soul. The biryani was different from the ones at arsalan or shiraz. Rice was rich but low on spice, two decent sized and tender mutton/chicken pcs and the potato. The taste and textures resembled my mothers' kachchi biryani. All in all nice.
My veggie friend had a long discussion with the server before ordering. He didn't want any side dish, so he wanted something spicy or masaledar rice preparation and the Masala Handi pulao was the sugeestion. But what came was disappointing. White long grained rice, again rich, with lots of paneer and khoya. No hint of masala at all. Decent in taste but definitely not one to be had without sides. A special mention is the earthen handi, which doubles as keeping the food hot and also keeping the aromas intact. A nice touch to the dining experience.

It was a biryani expedition more than a hearty lunch. And honestly a bit over budget. Thankfully there was some renovation going on in the ground floor due to which they are not levying taxes. Money saved.

The ambiance is great. A veg handi biryani should definitely be introduced. Galautis and biryani naushijaan beckon me for a second visit!

What should you be ordering? The kakori kebab, galawati kebab, keema matar, chicken lahori, the biriyanis (I love the way they serve and pack them in the handis), the mutton rara and the chicken handi qorma.

We often ordered from Naushijaan to cater to small gatherings at house parties. Once upon a time it was the go to place for us and always the first priority. Over the time it has become more of a second choice or just another option, due to the genuine dip in flavors. It is still better than a lot other places serving mughlai food in the city, but judging by its own output in the past, the flavors seem to be slightly compromised with.

Located nearly at bosepukur bus stand. Time was nearly 2 pm and except for us there were no other customer. 
Ambiance and Deco was nothing and that's not matter anymore if you serve good and tasty food. 
Order chicken tikka kebab and chicken biryani. 
Kebab came at 2:35 and biryani at 2:55. Pathetic service and the taste was crap.

Won't score high on ambience, though it's better after the renovation. Moderately friendly staff, average service.
The food is wonderful. The biriyanis are a treat to your taste buds. I'd recommend the handi biriyani. One of the best I've ever had.
Kebabs are tender and succulent, all of them. But the mutton galoti kebab is an unearthly experience. It's a bit heavy on your pocket, coming at eighty bucks a piece, but it's worth it. The crust is crisp and a bit caramelised, because of which the flavours get strong. The inside is soft and juicy with a subtle blend of spices. Tender and moist, it actually does 'melt' in your mouth. A must try.
The phirni has deteriorated a lot. Yes it has saffron, but mostly it's bland. Not at all worth the price. And the quantity is alarmingly less, a little more than half of its counterpart in Aminia.
I'd strongly recommend this place if you are a biriyani or a kabab lover.

And probably the best saahi tukra i ever had..

I just fell in love with this place once again.the best ghee flavor wala biriani with bund gosht and firni

Located right at Nabapally Bus Stand, I had dropped by this place a couple of months back after visiting my sister-in-law at her parental home nearby. I was directed to the first floor, where after making myself comfortable I ordered for a Mutton Biryani and some chicken side dish which I do not remember (probably chap or Qorma). The Biryani was amazing. Rich quality, soft boiled rice gave it an amazing texture. The gravy to the side dish was delectable as well. The Chicken was soft but as I started to dig into them, I found the appearance 'reddish' which meant that the portions had not been cleaned well. The waiter offered to make a replacement. Another side dish came up shortly, but again as I started digging in, the new portions had the reddish texture as well. Dejected, I gave up on the gravy and left my meal in-between.

However, as I got down, the smell of Kebabs enticed me, and I decided to pack their Tandoori Aloo for take-away. And I must say, those where really nice portions of potatoes. The stuffing was rich and gave a good balance of flavors. The pricing wasn't expensive but the quality here could have been better. The service was good.

This place according to me is a Biryani Hub for people staying nearby. The place serves lovely Biryani with an aroma which will take your heart. Located in the main road and few steps away from Acropolis Mall this place is very easy to find. The decor is done keeping the theme of vintage Lucknow but it didn't impressed me much. The staffs are well behaved and polite but are not well trained which can be a place for improvement.
The food here are pretty good and as per the reputation I took Biryani as well. The Handi Biryani was rich and different from all other Biryani which I had in other places. The aroma was fantastic and it tasted the same as well. I loved it. The Chicken Handi Quorma complimented well and it was really good. The chicken was soft and juicy which made it tastier. The price was pretty reasonable which made me more happy.

Last Words:
This place is always a good option when you wanna eat Biryani. The taste of Biryani here is really good. And the place will not hurt your pocket much. Definitely a go to place for Biryani Lovers.

3.5/5 is all i wanna give.

I should say this restaurant is a Biriyani  house. I tested biriyani from here countless time. Surprisingly every this me it was descend. Specially the Parda Biriyani... I love it. 
Cebabs are so so ... Not that much special.
Another thing is take away option would be the best option rather than using their restaurant facility.

The decor and ambience aren't too inviting. The staff too weren't available when we first went in. It took a lot of calling and finding to finally get the staff to do their job. 

Nevertheless once we had our taste of the mesmerizing biryani (which btw had potato and confused us, since Awadhi biryani doesn't have potatoes) and  Chicken tikka masala we knew this was the start of a love affair that had no end. Every bite was pure delight. It is slightly overpriced in relation to quantity, but worth the money if you go by taste ! 

We finished off with the royal Shahi tukda, which I'd previously tasted only in Royal, and trust me this one was as good, if not better. 

The restaurant might not be too clean and shiny, but I loved the fact that they've maintained the old Lucknow charm in sync with their cuisine. Must visit!

Visited the kasba branch of this restaurant. Biriyani was top class amazing but unfortunately the ambience of having such tasty mughal dish was below average. The biriyani melted my heart that's why the not so good ambience didn't overtake the joy of the biriyani. The AC was not working, it was terribly hot inside, inspite of giving 14% tax the plates were not clean and the service was not so good. Anyway according to their staffs the place is undergoing a renovation so we hope to see a much better ambience in this place. Inspite of this their biriyani keeps it going and will go on. Hope to visit there soon.

This place is located at a prominent route, albeit leaving you with a feeling of being in the middle of nowhere. Nevertheless, their Handi biriyani, with its smell of pure ghee, is tempting enough that I've visited this place multiple times. The ambience is pretty non-existent, however the biriyani is great, so it's fine by me.

Located at the kasba main road just 2-3 mins walking distance from the Acropolis mall towards bosepukur...

Went there on a Sunday night for dinner, although we were quite late for dinner and the clock was ticking at 11:15 p.m found this nearby place is available for food.

Decor and Ambiance:
Keeping the name in mind they have made the interiors like old Lucknow style. Though I strongly feel this place needs renovation and most importantly a clean up on the exteriors which could make the decor far more eye catching than a lot of places.
I loved the plates and the glasses they were serving into very authentic.

Food:
They prepare mughlai and Indian dishes mainly though you have options for Chinese as well which we didn't go for. Went on with the Indian option..

1. Chicken Lasuni Kebab - was decent in taste and I quite enjoyed this dish .

2. Chicken tikka Kebab - it was not so good very average.

3. Handi Biriyani- They make different type of Biriyani although others liked me but for me it's not very good. Okiash.
4. Chicken chap- It was usual and ok
5. Chicken Rara- I was expecting this dish to be tasty but the big chicken pieces were a bit too spongy and the gravy made with chicken keema whc was quite okay. For me it's not as I expected.
6. Muttom boti- well this gravy dish has really impressed me with the taste and quite a good one made with mutton keema.
7. Rumali roti: we wanted a tandoori roti but as it was late it was nt available. But the rumali ruti didn't work well . bt was usual
8. Lucknowi Paratha: This one was real nice and big in size. Very well made soft and less oily. I barely found some oil from it and tastes superb with the gravy dishes. Exclusive and exotic.
9. Sahi tukra: ok types..Not as per my liking as it was flavored with Rose water a bit too much.

The food was bit too rich for me as I dnt prefer rich food in general. Most of the dishes has the flavoured Rose water which might effect your taste as well if you are not very good with rich Indian food.
My suggestion to the would be a little toning down the richness to make it palatable for the people who doesn't prefer heavy food.

Service:
The people assisting you there are very good and helpful. I quite enjoyed the hospitality and service.

I had ordered for galauti Kabab and Chicken Malai Kabab for home delivery today. I had tried food from here earlier but today the galauti kabab was pathetic. It seems that they have given it raw without shallow frying it with a very pungent taste. The prices are quiet high and I am highly disappointed with such a poor quality of food. I am never going to try this restaurant again.

A place,which can be a bit difficult to locate,Naushijaan at Kasba is a dark horse when it comes to Biriyani.Had it been located at Park Circus which is the Mecca for all Biriyani lovers it would surely been up there with all other Biriyani Giants. Three of us visited on a cool breezy day at this place and even with GPS we took a few minutes to find this place.
The Ambience and Decor is simple and nothing impressive.The entire dining area was being managed by one guy who did everything from taking the orders to serving to billing,Result being the service getting way to slow. We had ordered Kakori Kabab, Keema Biriyani and Pardah Biriyani. The Kakori kabab was juicy and succulent and could hv  been better if chutni was served with it. Pardah Biriyani is Naushijaan's version of the Biriyani cooked with Tomato Capsicum etc.and was delicious. Keema Biriyani is the normal Biriyani with the chicken in shredded pieces but while it was quite OK for me,one of my friend found it to be too oily.The Chicken Side Dish we took was OK,nothing great.The amount in my opinion could have been bit more compared to prices,but no complains as Biriyani tasted grt...!!

Their mutton handi biryani and mutton roganjosh were my picks for a no-nonsense,in-mood-for-comfort food,Saturday night-in dinner.I really didn't mind the aloo in the supposedly Lucknow-style biryani and the pale-hued mutton rezala which they decided to call mutton roganjosh(authentically supposed to be fiery red).The food tasted AWESOME.The biryani came in a cute earthen handi and smelt amazing.It was light and non greasy inspite of the heady aroma of ghee wafting through the air.The rezala/rogan josh had a delicious gravy (I admit that the layer of oil on top had to be drained off).The meat melted in the mouth like butter.I don't know if it was a fluke but the biryani had 3 incredibly tender pieces of mutton.I seriously can't stop daydreaming about that pot of deliciousness.The pocket pinch is low.

Having heard a lot about this place, me along with my colleagues went on a weekday lunch this week. Definitely the food tastes good, but not something out of the box. We had ordered galawti kebab, lucknow paratha and chicken handi biryani. The parathas were crisp and like paper, very tasty. The kebabs had a raw smell of the meat, it tasted weird, the biryani was cooked in ghee and had a strong smell of the flavor, it was good but the pieces of chicken, not at all good. The service was quick, very quick. The place was empty, may be that's the reason. Also place didn't look to be hygienic too.

I would recommend people to go to taste a difference in flavors but any day opt for our Arsalan biryani than a handi biryani.

Service : after waiting 45 mint food was served. Which was not properly hot.

Having heard so much about this place, and thanks to some exciting discounts, I ended up ordering the Chicken Naushijaan Biryani. While it looked enticing in it's green (probably palak) hues, the biryani in itself was a let down. The excessive oil and the poor quality of rice just didn't do justice to the hype of Naushijaan.

There is nothing fancy about this place. Food and ambience is good. Reasonably priced. I had biriyani and chicken kebabs. The decor of the place is also average. Service is slow and staffs are untrained.

I had spent two years in Lucknow, and almost each week at least once paid visit to the famous kabab gulli near Press Club, Pariwartan Chowk. Though my favourite there was Dastarkhan, I visited Naushijaan too couple of times. So when my friends informed me that there is a Naushijaan in Kolkata too (branch of original Lucknow one), I was trying to visit the place. Finally, that did happen on 25th January, 2016.

The restaurant is on the main road (Google map shows it at wrong place, locate through Zomato). Nothing much about ambiance- pretty normal. Seeing this ambiance my companions posed doubt whether the food would be OK or not.

I was in mood to order Galawati, but the waiter informed that they started two starters new, which are good, and my companions suggested we order that. So ordered three plates of Nawab-e-Punj and three chicken handi biriyani.

Nawab-e-Punj was one of the awesomest mutton dish I had in my life. One plate contains two mutton ribs marinated with a thick yougurt-based paste. Mutton was damn soft, and the marination was fantastic. It tasted really really awesome, and everyone liked it.

The biriyani was good too (though awadhi biriyani does not contain 'aloo'), and chicken pieces were soft.

The bill came at Rs 987 (for three plates of Nawab-e-Punj, three chicken handi biriyanis and two water bottles).

The name suggested that there would be another mughlai cuisine specialist in town, but seriously not up to the mark!! Raan e murgh was ok types, Fish malai kebab was better though.. Biriyani is good here!! But they take a lot of time to do the service, lack of staff.. & coming to the interiors, disgusting..

Visited this place one afternoon with one of my friends as we were craving for some good biriyani.It was quite empty and the tables were left dirty with food pieces lying here and there.We ordered Mutton Biriyani and Coke.The glasses were covered with dust.The biriyani was cold and as we had our first bite we could literally feel sand.We asked one of the two waiters to change our plates.But he returned with those same plates only after heating the biriyani and the sand was still there.Finally we just left without paying for the food and just paid for the coke.We were thoroughly disappointed.

visited there last puja..may be saptami it was...located on the way to  E M bypass ..near rajdanga nabapally, nothing special about the decor,simple seating arrangement along with a LED tv in front...we just ordered their so called famous "handi biriyani" along with galouti kabab...
first they were too late to serve and there were not a many waiters only 1-2 .
somehow theye managed to serve the kababs which were delicate ..aromatic and delicious and mouthmelting .
and after 30 mins they served the biriyani..which was basically nothing more than a "aromatic mashed potato rice" (aloo bhate)...nothing special..overcooked rice ruined the dish.

I took my parents and extended family for dinner to Naushijaan. As it is near to my place, we walked down. I was a little let down by the appearance of it, but wanted to try as had heard good things about the food. And I wasn't disappointed. Not even by a long shot.
We had ordered kakori and galawti kebabs to start off with. And they were amazing. We had ordered 4types of kebabs and all of them were pretty amazing. However, the best of the lot, was perhaps lahsuni murg.
For the main course we had ordered chicken rara and lucknowi parantha. Both were superb. The paranthas were surprisingly less oily and very crisp.
The only letdown was the service. It was lackadaisical and sloppy. It seemed as if they were not interested to serve. And also, it took a lot of time for the food to arrive. I am giving it a 4 only cuz of the poor service. The food was, as my friend Arindam would say, "Ek number"
If you are looking for a lucknawi or a awadhi type of cuisine, I would definitely recommend this place

Not knowing what to do the previous Sunday, got hooked up with a friend who took me to this place, which I would have never come across on my own.

The place is simple and not really eye-grabbing. But boy, the stuff of interest is the galouti kebab which with its quantity, quality and pricing puts many a authentic restaurant in Delhi to shame. The galoutis were juicy and almost melted in your mouth. You would say, but that's what they are supposed to be. Believe me if you have tried the best galoutis in Delhi, then you would definitely understand what I am trying to put across. 

Anyways, much to my friend's dismay I also tried out the chicken bharta which was decent.
My recommendation is the place is worth a visit simply for the galoutis.

The magnitude of catastrophe of the food here can be assessed by the fact that a sunday dinner of galauti kebab and parantha had to be followed by mom's simple fish curry and rice to overcome the after-taste. Yes, the kebab was burnt, inadequately spiced and dunked in lots of pepper. The parantha was slightly dry. 

The shahi tukra was the saving grace, and a dish I would recommend.  

That being said, I am sad. It is christmas season and I should be having awesome food. Not pepper soaked galauti. Damn !

The mutton gosht too was yummy and very soft.. had to have a glass of coke with it as both the dishes were rich and heavy .. a lil quantity packed up my lil tummy.. a must place to visit for all biriyani lovers...

I HAD THEIR FOOD MANY TIMES BUT HOME DELIVERED IN MY COUSINS HOME OR A FRIEND'S PLACE.
THEIR TWO BEST PREPARATIONS ARE GALAUTI AND BIRYANI(TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OUTLETS).TO MY PERSONAL OPINION THE GALAUTI IS  MUCH BETTER THAN TUNDA'S IN AMINABAD LUCKNOW.
THEIR TANDOORI PREPARATIONS WERE LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT ONE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE IN KOLKATA BUT OFF LATE THEY ARE NOT DOING JUSTICE TO THIS.

Handi Biryani (both chicken and mutton)

Burra Kebab

Galauti Kebab

Palak Daal

Nargisi Kofta

The food is flavorful and spicy without being overtly so.

Quite a delirious passage to the seating area on the first floor. The service is a sweat toiling one. Once you order, keep yourself energized for quite sometime.
Food I loved here was the Handi Biriyani, with the aroma of ghee. One special name in the menu, that strikes out was Jugalbandi. I tried this and was awestruck. Mutton galawti kebab rolled in chicken, and cooked perfectly. Loved it!

Have been to this place several times and tried some of the dishes, but would recommend to try their rolls, specially the Galawti kabab or Kakori kabab ones, no doubt its cooked well but it has all the required ingredients to term it AWESOME, have a decent decor and amenities not very expressive, but have seen some renovation is going on when i visited last day, somehow the irritatiing part of them is the SERVICE, a big disappointing kind of service they offer, it seems they love their place to be empty, if someone drops in their body language is like we have done a mistake by visiting their place, don't know what they are upto, but i simply didn't liked their service attitude at all.... even  a softdrink takes 4 calls and half an hour to reach our table... simply annoying...

Small moghlai place near my Dads house at Kolkata. We do mostly take away from here. The special dum Biriyani is quite nice and not too oily. I like their chicken chaanp and parothas as well.

Draws a crowd so getting a table on a busy evening can be a challenge at times. 3.5 stars since Kolkata is replete with great eateries and the standards have to be kept tight. The same biriyani back in Bangalore would rate much higher!

12th Nov 2015: went for dinner with a friend, having heard much about their biryani and galawati kabab.. First, the accommodation is very small with 5-6 tables, managed by 2 waiters... we had to wait for about 40 mins when there was no rush of customers. That followed a half burnt tandoori and a half cooked galawati kabab. The awadhi style biryani was drenching with oil.. and the pineapple raita was served as 200 ml of Plain Curd with foul smelling, semi-rotten pineapple slices dipped into it. :( :( 
Being a biryani freak and having had the same at almost every nook of the city, my appetite met some cold experience... sorry about writing it in such a manner but cant help it!!!

We ordered  15 packs of Mutton Handi Biriyani along with 7 Chicked Handi Qorma for 15 people. The briyani was terribly packed. The quantity wasn't enough for any adult sized person. The chicken pieces looked like they were specially ordered for a doll house party. We finished our lunch with half empty stomach. It is widely believed that all restaurants  curtail in case of a parcel or takeaway but Naushijaan took this to a whole new level. The Biriyani tasted alright. The Chicked Handi Quorma was light with a mild taste. This was a highly recommended place from many of our friends. I am sad to say that none of us  would ever order from this place again.

Good for takeaway, as the restaurant servise is very bad, with reluctant waiters, unclean table. and suffocating interior. Waiters are  not around most of the times. Now about Food

Galowti kabab- Awesome in one word. the best Galowti kabab I have ever had

Paratha- large and delicious

Chicken item- can try any- all are tasty and good

Biriyani- portions are small, but no doubt tasty. They provide a huge variety.  Pick any one. I however didnt like pardah biryani.

Watching this restaurant from years. But did not try. Always stick to good old park circus and esplande restaurants when it comes to biriyanis. Today I thought lets try. Feel lucky that I too the decision. I took delivery. Handi biriyani and mutton stew. They give the biriyanis in handi. But that's not important; what I liked the most is the proportion of rice quantity vs mutton PCs in biriyani. If you go to any other restaurants and want to have more mutton PCs s (not just one) then u have to order 'special' bititani and the problem I face is with the rice quantity in that special item and off course u need to pay approx 100 rupees extra. Here the price is in between. Taste is awesome and the mutton stew was juicy and tendered. Thumbs up. They have prawn and other variations of biriyanis. Will try one by one. :)

Chicken chap was average but the other items were just awesome. I just loved the mutton biriyani. The quality of mutton was very soft and tender and the biriyani was also very light one.

I was greatly looking forward to having a fantastic biriyani and kabab dinner from Naushijaan. This was my first and probably the only order ever from this place. I ordered home delivery handi biryani, burra, galoti kabab, Lucknowi paratha and firni to be shared among five people. The biryani was light and not overly spicy which I liked. But the mutton pieces in the the handi were so small it can hardly justify the price. Burra mutton pieces were undercooked and hardly edible. Galoti kabab meat had a strange smell which was repulsive for me and couldn't eat the thing. Firni was good but cannot justify the price tag for the amount in each serving. It could be that during puja days the quality went down quite a bit but to maintain their brand name I think the owners should pay little more attention to having consistent quality and quantity that can justify the price. Overall I along with my family members were sorely disappointed with our astami dinner and probably my only biryani dinner during this long awaited puja time visit to my hometown.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A FOOD REVIEW OF NAUSHIJAAN, BECAUSE WE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE FOOD AND LEFT BEFORE THAT.
I rarely give a place the minimum rating because i tend to search for anything good in a place that is extremely bad. But unfortunately naushijaan disappointed me that much. I had high expectations from this place and upon arrival we climbed the staircase to enter a small room with a low ceiling that could seat around 20 persons. First thing i noticed was the large tv that glared straight into my eyes was not a fit for a small room like that and indeed shed a lot of light into the eyes. We asked for the menu and after a while someone came up with a greasy menu card. At once we stooped down to decide our order and quickly made up our mind to take a chicken tikka kebab as starter. We placed our order with a different waiter this time and asked water to be served. He went down and came up with nothing. We again quickly decided the rest of the order and placed it with the same person and he again went down. However even after 5 minutes no one attended and so i went downstairs to ask again to serve water. A few minutes passed by after i came back and that person returned empty handed and went on to serve finger bowls at another table. I was perturbed by this especially since i had asked two times before for water yet he didn't seem to pay heed. As i was about to call him again, the waiter came up and said we might have to wait around half an hour for our food as they were having some issues with water. I asked why we weren't told that earlier, to which he replied he didn't know about it.
Now i was quite hungry and after seeing the menu my appetite increased. So after that when i heard something like that i thanked the waiter and left the place.
I narrated the whole incident to explain why i was so annoyed with the management at naushijaan(kasba). The waiters didn't even bother to serve water, and after keeping us for 15 minutes said it would take half an hour more. This was quite unacceptable, and other foodies might be at luck when they visit this place, but i rate this place very lowly for its customer handling.

This is the kebab place. Trust me. And a take away place. Cuz the dining area is cramped and small with dirty chairs. Am sure its done on purpose to discourage people to dine in cuz the food is great. Kebabs are very well marinated, succulent, and with distinctive tastes. Highly recommended: galawti, kakori, reshmi,sheekh, jugalbandi. The biryani is pretty good but a bit high on aroma. But each one has a distinctive style. Naushijaan special has palak flavour. Handi biryani comes in a earthen pot, purdah biryani comes with a flour cover. However the basic flavor of most biryani remains the same. In side dishes mutton stew is great. But just go for the kebabs. The platter can be tried to have a taste of their signature offerings

Renovation was going on when I visited this place in June. So it's futile to discuss on the interiors. Let's get down to the most important aspect of any joint, Quality of Food. I ordered only Mutton Biryani as I was not in for a huge spread. I had heard good things about their food but my Biryani wasn't up to the mark. It was dry & taste was flat. Service was quick & the owner was very hospitable. She apologised for the half done interiors & informed they are opening their continental wing on that floor named Con-T. As far as Biryani at Naushijaan is concerned, Recommendation: NO

This place is really close to my place and I have ordered from here a gazillion times in addition to a proper sit down meal with friends a couple of times. I am not a fan of the restaurant for a sit down meal. I prefer the delivery simple because I do no think they have the infrastructure (lighting/seating/service) for making a good impression on a person looking for a place to eat out with family, friends or spouse. Having said that, I do rate is 3.5 purely because of the taste of their food. It completely bowls me over every single time. I have had Biryani from all the "famous" places around Kolkata. In terms of "normal Biryani", I put the Biryani from Naushijaan a close third behind Arsalan and Shiraz. However, sticking to Biryani's, they have a joker up their sleeve. Their KEEMA NAUSHIJAAN BIRYANI is to die for. It is just perfect in terms of portion size for a proper meal without any additional fares. And it is probably the most perfect variation of a Biryani I have ever put my tongue on. Their starters are good albeit I found the portion sizes really small compared to the rates. Their naan's are nice. However, the part that disappoints is the fact that there is hardly any unique taste in any of their other products which would constitute a regular meal like a Main Course Chicken/Mutton dish. Only saving graces are the Keema Muttar and Keema Masala.

The keema biriyani is the only thing that I have had here. In a few words, it may be described as a sumptuous delicacy, fit for the royalty, with the aroma of pure ghee, making one never doubt about the authenticity of the food.
Good value for money.

I have been to this place yesterday evening, ordered Handi Chicken Biriyani, Kababs and a Chicken Tikka Masala. The quality of the food is very good, medium spicy, just as required and overpriced. They served the biriyani with a clay pot, which is very unique and best in this line of service.Apart from the food, let's talk about the ambience, hospitality and service. This place has very poor ambience, they have two ACs on, but they keep the door wide open, after we repeatedly asked to close it. They keep a television on with some hindi serials on, and kept watching them, even after our irritatiion. The service is very slow. Hospitality is very poor. We had a very clear picture about the awesomeness of this place, but we won't opt for this place again.@Arnisha Dey

For signature food, I pay little relevance to the ambiance. The outlet is visibly located on the main street and walking up to the 1st floor restaurant might lead you to have second thoughts on the food that will be served. 

The Zomato reviews had thankfully set expectations and what was delightful to acknowledge was the preparedness of the staff to set right expectations wrt the time that will be taken to serve the food. 

Rehan and his team were at their toes to make our experience delightful, yesterday when we landed at 10 pm.

We had galawti kebabs, crisp parathas, handi biriyani and mutton stew as the main course and shahi tukra as the dessert.
The kebab was a straight from the oven with its aroma setting the mood for the food. We had to ask for a second round as the crispy parathas looked lonesome in the plate. The handi biriyani was cooked in pure ghee and the mutton stew had succulent pieces, stewed just right in its juices and awadhi condiments. 

A very high score for the prices, it is a definite value for money and when you add the smiling faces of the serving staff, the entire experience was a bonus in the rain soaked night. 

A must visit for anyone wishing to experience Mughlai food!

Below par Moghlai restaurant. Biriyani is different but nothing outstanding. The service is this place is worse than what one can imagine.. Food comes late and is served cold if you happen to order more than one item.
Ambience is lousy and the crowd is pathetic. 

When we pushed for an early delivery, the mutton bara kabab was served undercooked.
 Would not recommend this place to any good friend.

I have had biryani here many times and the couple who own this place have become friends.

Galawti kabab with paratha,mutton bara kabab,the claypot awadhi biryani which he kindly inserts eggs in too are our favourites and the food has always been good.

The concern is cleanliness and since the owners have ventured into multiple outlets,they have to address this.

I have been to this restaurant more than a couple of times now. The 2 complaints which I had earlier were, 1. slow service and 2. no decoration. However on visiting yesterday I was surprised, because their service time has improved remarkably and also they have worked on the decoration and lighting as well. Good job to the management on that.

Their Galawti Kebab and Lucknowi Paratha combination is something to die for! Very few places in kolkata can serve you these, atleast I don't know too many places. The Galawti, as the name suggests is absolutely soggy, soft and it melts in your mouth. Brilliant flavors. Also their Mutton Handi Biryani is too good. They use extremely good ghee and wonderful spices which makes the biryani so aromatic. Light yet tasty, one which takes you back to the restaurant again! The Mutton Keema Biryani is quite spicy and rich on taste. I like the earthen pots in which they deliver the biryanis (handi and keema). You must try the Jugalbandi, I'm sure it will surprise you. I have also had the mutton keema stuffed paratha, too little, too less for my appetite. The rates are on the higher side, but quality of food is just awesome and special.

This is a great restaurant for trying awadhi cuisine. Lucknow is a place for rich food and foodies, and Naushijaan brings Lucknow to Kolkata! A must try!

Staying in Lucknow for 6 months, this place turned out to be my surprise package in Kolkata. Near to my place, the Handi biriyani is absolutely lipsmacking. The chaaps are well different but nice. I wouldnt advice taking the Keema biriyani though. The paratha is true to lucknawi style and nowhere available anywhere in Kolkata for sure. This place is deemed to give Arsalan, Shiraz and Aminia a run for its money.

Visited to taste the authentic Awadhi food  specially the handi biryani but came out with utter disappointment. Though it looks quite good from outside the interiors is shabby not well lit,ill maintained.The service is very poor. Ordered mushroom kebabs, tandoori and Awadhi biryani,firni. The taste of the kebabs and tandoori was average .I was looking forward to the biryani which also tasted plain. Even the firni tasted average. A very unpleasant  experience and to our utter shock they gave us a hand written bill with faulty calculations.P.S:Not at all recommended. There are better places in the city to have good north indian food at reasonable prices.

Ordered home delivery. Murg Malai Tikka,  Chicken Biryani, Garlic Naan and Chicken Seekh Kebab Butter Masala. The food arrived in 45mins, as promised. 
The kebabs were nicely done , but I've tasted better. The kebab butter masala was slightly over salted though. Biryani was average.
Maybe the food would have tasted better at the restaurant itself rather than delivered, who knows. 
On the whole, worth a try.

If you want to taste Biryani in a different style then this is the place. Naushijaan serves Biryani in Awadi style. 

I tried Mutton Handi Biryani, which was very well prepared. It was very tasty because of the added Ghee. The mutton was also very soft.

This place serves pocket friendly lucknavi food. The food is good but the service needs to be improved a bit. If you sit there to eat, you might have animals running in your belly as they serve quite late after taking the order. The ambience and infrastructure ain't good either. But still the kebabs are good and so is the biriyani. Once you get the food you will not be disappointed with it but getting the food is a big game itself. Also the home delivery service is very very poor. They really need to buck up now to sustain.

When this new Awadhi restaurant came up, I was intrigued. The fancy name looked promising, so did their menu and exterior of the building.
However, the place is quite shabby and the service takes ages. I would not recommend the home delivery service at all. 
Handi Biryani, a few kebabs, and a couple of dishes are fairly good. I would not say excellent.
The quantity is not satisfactory,neither are the prices.

I had heard a lot about this place from friends & family and finally decided to try it out today! I had gone out for a late lunch with my husband and sister and all three of us were new to this place (In fact, it was me who suggested Naushijaan to the other two). I was taken a bit aback by the plain set-up of the place, but since we were all very hungry, we didn't dwell on that too much and wanted to order as fast as possible. Once we went up, we had to wait for 10 mins before a restaurant staff came up and gave us the menu. We decided on our order pretty fast, but the only waiter who was present in the room didn't respond when we called him 2-3 times, and went out without paying any heed to us. Then another waiter came with our water (we had asked for regular) and took the order. On noticing that the water was of room temperature (and it being 40 degrees outside for the past 2 days), we asked the waiter if he could serve us some cold water. He said that if we wanted cold water, we would have to buy mineral water, which we promptly ordered. Being as hungry as we were, we dived in as soon as the food arrived - my Chicken Biriyani was good (nothing great, but good) with 2 medium pieces of chicken and one potato. My husband's Chicken Chap was nothing spectacular, though my sister's Chicken Butter Masala was quite tasty with nice flavours of spices & butter. The Naans were not as soft they should have been. And surprisingly, the fresh lime soda (which was a necessity in that heat and which you can't go wrong with) turned out to be a disappointment. My sister said hers was fine, though I felt mine had a weird, stale aftertaste which made it impossible for me to take more than 3-4 sips. For dessert, me & my husband decided to share a Shahi Tukra, while my sister ordered Phirni. She said the Phirni was average and was less sweet than it generally should be. The Shahi Tukra was nice, but made in a way different than the original form. I felt, as per the quality of food and the ambience, the pricing is a bit on the higher side and I can definitely spend that same amount of money on a better restaurant. In spite of having heard rave reviews of this place before, I found my experience to be a bit disappointing. Hope they improve their ambience, service & food in the future so that I might think of going back again someday!

Food quality depends what you order. Good experience so far with handi biriyani, moti  biriyani, lahori kabab is a must for kebab lovers. Few mutton items are not up to the marks at all i.e. mutton balti. So for food quality 3.5/5.

Service is good for home delivery as well.

Price is okay. Will suggest once to visit.

Are u bored with Kolkata Biriyani...????? Just go to Naushijaan. Naushijaan is special for Lucknow Biriyani. it was yammmmmmyyyyy.The restautent is not well decorated, just an AC room with 5-6 table and not very clean also. But the biriyani, Handi Biriyani, was awesome. Best thing of d restaurant is they will serve the biriyani in earthenware. I have tasted mutton kasha which is also very delicious.

To begin with one word of caution.

1.   Your patience will be tested.
2. Choose your menu quickly
3. Do not have any expectation on ambience

Reasons

The food ordered by us took approx an Hour for them to serve.
After having read a lot of positives about naushijaan from fellow zomato and other sites we decided to have a pretty long drive approx 35 kms to reach Naushijaan.the ambience was not at all appealing. Looked like a dilapidated shack kinda place though the exterior looked appealing.
Only  1 waiter and a running errand boy cum table mopping boy to take care of around 9 tables seating 36 persons approx.

If you fidget for which food to eat or take some time your chance will be grabbed by some one else and your food will be served after theirs even if they had come after you.

Concept or not i learnt that they aill put the raw steaks or meat items in oven only after u order. There solves the mystery of 1 hour taken to serve  1 kabab platter. 2 bowls of biryani. !!!

As per quality of food.
siraj or amenia are tastier in biryani and other kebabs which were produced before is.

Galawti ( lucknowi delicacy) kabab was tasty though. Cant compare with any other but i had tasted it in lucknow and this 5aste almost matches but the pressntation lacked both finnesse and class.

My advice is go there if u have more than 2 hours to kill and lots and lots of money.

Regards
Pal


Thanks

We went there for tasting biriyani from a new place. But this was disappointing. This is a restaurant which is not ready for giving you a dine-in comfort. They have shabby entrance, everything was looking like under-construction. They have sitting arrangement on the first floor, which a narrow staircase will lead you to. The chairs, tables are like a dhaba at the highway-side, very poor ambiance. Service is poor too. No one cares to attend you. Except the person who take the order, everyone was busy watching T.V. We even have to ask the for giving us the glass of water (that also after waiting for 20 minutes).

We just ordered mutton biriyani, Chicken platter and pineapple raita. And for this we have to wait a long 40-45 minutes. After that they served biriyani first and then raita (they don't know the minimum manners for serving the food, sorry to say).

The biriyani was not bad, you can smell and taste the ghee in it, quantity was OK, potato and mutton was well cooked. But the mutton pieces were very small, though they supposed to give two pieces of mutton but they gave 1 and half. And for our surprise they served kebabs and tandooris after biriyani with only some onions and asked that if we need any pudina chutny (Ha ha! don't know what to say).

They don't maintain starter-main course-dessert system. kebabs and tandooris in chicken platter was half burnt, dry and "chipli" was disgusting. Raita has only curd and pieces of pineapple. They mixed only some sugar to the card (Grains of sugar was still there, had not mixed well) and no masala. They served finger bowl with cold water. If they want to win hearts, have to work on service, food and ambience.. All ! best of luck guys ....

 So, after all I came to the conclusion that If you want to parcel biriyani from this restaurant, surely you can take-away. But for dining-in, it'll be a bad idea.

[The pictures of the dishes have been uploaded separately for a better view of all the individual food items]

There are some restaurants where you have to focus on some of the main dishes which are directly related to the cuisine the restaurant deals with. Naushijaan being one of them has some really delectable dishes if chosen wisely.

I was there for dinner with my parents and brother on 1st May and found the place to be almost full.
Firstly, the ambience is shabby and a table for four is very small and uncomfortable. The covering of the chairs are mostly torn. The staff there are not very well trained.
The reasons stated above were why we decided to pack our food and not dine in there.
I have deducted 0.5 from the rating for the reasons stated above.
However, the lady at the takeaway counter (who was most probably the owner) was kind enough and assured us that we wont face any problem when we dine in there, again. But, I would suggest everyone for a takeaway.

Coming to the food we ordered,
1) 1 chicken platter @Rs600 (4.6/5) : The platter consisted of the followng item ;

- 1 tangri kebab (Soft, succulent and well charred. 4.2/5) ,

- 1 Tandoori chicken ( A bit over charred but full of flavour. 3.8/5) ,

- 1 seekh kebab (A bit dry but flavourful. 3.5/5)

- 2 malai tikka (Well marinated and the taste was spot on. Very soft. 4.5/5)

- 2 lasuni (The garlicky flavour was tickling my taste buds and my taste buds were indeed very pleased. 4/5)

- 2 Banjara (Dint like it much. Had a strong taste of gram flour or besan. 2.5/5)

The chicken platter is worth a try. They also have a mutton kebab platter which I have not tried out yet. But soon, will. :)

2) Lucknowi paratha Rs.35 per piece (3.9/5) : The paratha was less oily and had a good balance of the sweet and salt quotient. Went well with the kebabs.

3) Roomali Roti, Rs. 20 per piece : Tasted like a normal roomali roti.

4) Mutton nihari, Rs.200 (4.5/5) : Now, this was one amazing dish. The gravy was superb. It was mildly spicy and was full of flavours. One mouthful of it and my taste buds were already singing "tareef karoon kya uski jisne tujhe banaya" :P. The meat portion on the nalli pieces were very soft.

5) Handi Biryani (4.2/5) Rs.200 each : The Biryani is generally cooked in a handi with some aromatic spices. The Biryani was really good and came with a potato and two decent sized mutton pieces.

6) Firni, Rs.60 (3/5): The firni was okayish. I love the firni from Arsalan and I believe that they do make one of the best firnis in the city.

7) Sahi Tukra, Rs.100 (5/5) : I dont really give a 5/5 to a dish until and unless I reaaalllllyyyyy love it. The sahi tukra was one of them. It was just amazing.

The total bill came up to be Rs.1683.00 (Rs.1470 + vat of Rs.213) for 4 people which was quite reasonable at Rs.420 (approx) per person, given to the quality of food served.

This place can be given a shot. Please dont order the usual chicken butter masala and all. Do go for the kebabs and you wont be disappointed.

Recommended.

Happy eating. :)

Lately everyone has been raving about this place, in fat a friend of mine even gave Naushijaan - the award for best kebabs in South Kolkata!!
So finally I decided to just check it out for once. It's situated in Kasba and I just availed their home delivery service. 
We are four family members and we ordered for Lucknowi seekh kebab, Murg Lasuni, Mushroom Malai Tikka and of course the very much talked about Handi Biriyani! 
Their proportions compared to their price is something I really liked about this place, the containers were all nicely packed and it seemed like they actually prepared the food with love.
The biriyani is super fine and full of flavours, the Lasuni chicken is a boneless gravy cooked perfectly and the mushroom malai tikka was delicious! The kebab was of course the star of the evening, juicy, succulent & moist-couldn't get enough of the kebabs! 
I would like to visit their place once but as far as the home delivery service was concerned I am supremely happy with their service and of course their food.

To start of the ambience isn't great. Though the food quality is not bad but the quantity is a major concern. Ordered handi biriyani which is a speciality here but the outcome was disappointing. Hardly filling for even 1 person though quality wasn't bad but certainly not worth 200.

Had the normal chicken biryani and malai tikka home delivered.At 530 bucks very reasonable ,super yum and surprisingly light meal.The biryani is sort of a meeting ground between the typical kolkata biryani and the usual Lucknow biryani.The malai tikka was juicy,tender and cooked just perfectly.Definitely trying again!Also if you don't like the ambience,they are renovating.Or if you are located too far off to get home delivery just go to Lucknow at Park Circus.

Had heard a lot about this place ..... so i was literally all excited for my maiden experience....being a lover of Mughlai food.... I must admit to have been let down! I was even surprised to see a chicken bone saying "Hello!" to me amidst what poured out of Handi MUTTON Biriyani! Murgh Hariyali and Mutton Gilauti was smeared with salt! Considering the price they charge....at least they should mind the interiors! Waiters 》non courteous. Restaurant 》 shabby and unclean. Food 》 miles to go... ESPECIALLY if you are serving Biriyani in Kolkata!

Heard of Naushijaan for long but never had an opportunity to
try the same.

Was travelling to a friend’s house and wanted to pickup
lunch and thus Naushijaan on 21st March, 2015.

We ordered 2 Handi and 1 Naushijaan Biriyani, Mutton Stew
and Raita to be packed and while they do it, my wife and I ordered 2 Mutton
Burrah kebabs and 2 masala Thumpsup.

The lady at the counter was nice and polite and perfectly
did her part, including informing of 2 new outlets.

Review:

Very dirty, including the toilet.The restaurant upstairs also had a shabby look
with fraying under liners on the table.Food was very ordinary.Was excited to learn that the Mutton Stew would
be Lucknowi which normally they serve at Karim’s (Ishtew) in Delhi, but nowhere
near it.Burrah had a stale smell. Masala needed some
more cooking. Bad product.They do not give you finger bowls, strange for
an Indian restaurant.The bill came with wrong charges. Handi Biriyani
was for Rs. 200.00 each but was charged @ Rs. 250.00 which they corrected after
pointing out. What would happen if I had missed?













Overall, does not demand a second visit. May be our hopes
were higher as we were expecting a piece of Lucknow in Kolkata.

This is not the usual mughlai restaurants that you find in Kolkata. It's more of the Lucknow gharana. The taste is mild and subtle and they serve the best Chicken Malai Tikka I have had in a very long time. If you are a kebab fan you must visit this place.

After having heard a lot about this young Turk in the Calcutta biryani scene, I walked into Naushijaan with a great deal of expectation. Ever since moving out of the city, I've made it a point to visit Biryani places in the city with grim determination and a healthy appetite. Located right off the Gariahat connector, this little restaurant had garnered enough accolades to pique my curiosity. So I reached the first floor and ordered their special Biryani on a pleasant February evening. It was a weekday and crowds were thin. Their seating area was lit in a dim tube light and did not inspire confidence. 

Anyhow, I asked for a soft drink and waited for the food to arrive, and when it did, I was in for a surprise. Their special biryani, as it turned out, was a strange concoction that was evidently drummed up by someone with strange ideas about gastronomy. Underneath the mound of what was admittedly quality, fragrant rice was a pile of meat covered with—wait for it—spinach! Now saag mutton isn't one of my favourite things in the universe, mind you. Whoever thought biryani went well with spinach, in my opinion, is making some sort of elaborate joke. The flavour of the spinach overtook the delicate fragrance of the rice and in a while it seemed like I was eating saag mutton and tehri. Which I evidently wasn't in the mood to stomach. I finished the entire dish, but somewhere my expectation of a delicate biryani fizzled out. And to top it off, they did not add the all-important aloo to the biryani. A cardinal sin in my book.

To my mind, Calcutta biryani is the food of the gods, it should be treated with reverence and not mixed with a gravy dish, especially one that has spinach. Rather than being innovative, it looks just like lazy attempt to do something different just for the sake of it.

To be fair, I'll order their regular biryani on my next trip to Calcutta, as the rice was indeed flavourful, and I'd like to make a fair review then, but until that, I'm saying a firm no to the underwhelming spinach pulao.

We loved: Biryani rice was decent
We shrugged: The palongshaak formula just didn't work

Tried Handi Biriyani there ..it was good enough but not out of the world or such.
Galwati kabab was not as expected as it was less crispy and not worth the price (2 piece only) .

The biriyani here is just awesum....dont order the normal biriyani though by mistake...order the 'one & only handi biriyani'....vry different compared to other biriyani in kolkata...as name suggests it comes in a handi which xcites u the first time u see it & forces u come bck again....other dish I like here is galawati kabeb....vry similar to one u get in delhi (not lucknow as thy claim)...others dish are ok type....so bcoz of the biriyani I wud rate them 4 but for othr food which though good is nt out of the world...so overall for food I wud rate 3.5....bt the resturant is vry small with zero ambience. ..slow service. ..and non working ac's...so taking evrythng into account I wud rate 3....basically take the handi biriyani,galawati kabab and go home to njoy :)

Was thinking of visiting this place for a while now, as a friend of mine recommended because of their special handi biriyani. Well the handi biriyani was nice, lil diff from the traditional kolkata biriyani, but good. The quality seemed very nice. We also ordered galawti kabab. It was a disaster. It was too salty. We couldnt even finish it. The overall ambiance of the place isnt very good and service by the staff in the establishment wasnt up to the mark. Towards the end of our dinner i called one of them, he didnt even bother come near and ask...he just stood on the other side of the floor and asked what i need. There was also a problem on the bill, we ordered 2 biriyani, they forgot add of them in the bill. They dont seem have much handle on what they at doing.
Overall:
Food : 5/10
Ambiance : 2/10
Service : 2/10

Really good food.
Biryani lovers would go gaga over this place. From the moment you set foot inside this place you are greeted with this familiar smell of ghee resonating from the Handi Biryanis.
I haven't really explored their entire menu in spite of having come here several times. The reason is that the handi biryani( their speciality) is always a must have. Their kebabs are also very good. They were soft, well cooked and had the right balance of spice. 
The handi Biryani is surprisingly light and doesn't leave that oily layer of dalda on your fingers which generally happens after having Biryani. It tastes very different from the traditional Kolkata biryani but is really tasty.
I highly recommend this place for biryani lovers who are bored of having biryanis from the usual arsalan, shiraz etc and are looking for something different. 
Just step one foot inside this place. The smell of the handi biryani will do the rest.

Being a biriyani addict that I am this place I have visited a lot no of times. Not that big a seating area, best is to take away. They are one of the most varied biriyani makers. The best biriyani which I found and ordered lot no of times is the Handi Biriyani, even the Galawti Kabab is relishing. The biriyani itself is so tasty and the smell of pure ghee any side dish would be perfect for it.

I have been enjoying the delicacies at Naushijaan but the last two experiences, both in December 2014 have left me feeling disgusted and cheated. Having frequented this place, I am well aware of the different dishes and their taste.The last two time, I took my favourite handi biriyani as take away. The first time it was  a little late in the night, close to their closing time and the second time was new year's eve. However, they said that the biriyani is available but when we went home to enjoy it, we found that it was not the handi dum biriyani (which they claim to make in ghee) but their normal biriyani (made in oil) filled in handis. There was neither the aroma , nor the taste of ghee. This was most upsetting because of the manipulation involved. In fact, the second time when we called the restaurant to complain - they quickly said "it could have been a misunderstanding. We will send you free biriyanis.". How could there be a misunderstanding while filling the handi?

We have been frequent visitors of this place for its authentic food and their preparation.  However, we recently had a take away of Handi Biryani for a friend who is seriously allergic to any food prepared by Dalda. We clarified with the people there and based on their assurance we ordered the food. As soon as the friend had a bite she suspected something was wrong, it for sure tasted like regular biryani just given in a Handi. When something is made of Dalda once the food gets cold it forms a peculiar layer over the food. We called and they agreed to send another handi biryani as a replacement and also said we were the only ones to complain. The point is not about replacement of the food or us being only ones to complain. All they had to do was just clarify when we asked before ordering. Because it lead to a very bad allergic reaction to my friend and caused lot of agony for days. All we expect from a good eating place to be clear about their preparation and what they serve for our good and their reputation as well.

This place is like an ancient treasure chest..unappealing from outside and paraside inside!! Not with respect to the infrastructure of course. .but once the food conquers your taste buds you are sure to come back again and again..
Yes..this is where I've had the best biriyanis, tandoors and kebabs..not to mention the handi biriyani and keema biriyani..and I keep asking myself why I didn't visit this place before..the biriyanis are subtle and light with just the right amount of spices..take aways and home deliveries are more common here and Naushijaan has been my favourite mughlai food stop since the past one year. Although the interior seating and amenities cause it to lose points the food..quality and quantity et all does deserve a full 4 pointer!!

The ambience is not to great but the food is really gr8....and it is not too pricey.....
We had Mutton Handi Biryani with Veg Raita.....
I found out the Biryani to be simply superb.... Not too spicy and too oily.... And the bigger handi was a bit much for 2....
Next time I would love to taste the kababs....

Didn't realise never wrote review about Naushijaan even after eating here so many times. I am a big fan of the Mutton Galawti Kebab here. Its just melt inside mouth and rich is flavour. Mutton Handi Biriyani is highly recommended too. One portion of handi biriyani is enough for 3 people. Along with biriyani I frequently have side dishes like Mutton Boti and Chicken Bharta.
Apart from this they have few other Lucknowi dishes which we don't generally find in all restaurants. Ambiance wise or by looking at its exterior you wont be pleased hence i prefer to go for takeaway.
However the price have increased a lot recently and if you have to pay by card there will additional 14.5% VAT above takeaway menu rate.

Past Wednesday i had been there with my office colleague, we have been tried this restaurant before but in a form of home delivery. This is my first time visit there....
1: Ambiance-  OK OK type, a.c was there but still not much difference..though other things are in well mannered.
2: Stuff- In my opinion a staff should be well mannered and he should know about the food listing there. Because they are the first representative of a restaurant. A large group was sitting beside our table and one of them complain about the fly..and the staff reply theirs nothing in his hand. VERY RUDE. 
3: Food- We have ordered one chicken butter tikka masala and rumali roti..i really enjoy the taste no complaint there. As i told we mainly ordered their food as a home delivery, so this time i want to check the restaurant from inside..later we ordered pineapple raita..the boy took the ordered and come back after 10 mins that pineapple raita is not available not now...DISAPPOINTED. Then we ordered firni..come quickly and i found the taste is better than others i have been tasted. After finished our food we seek for a basin and no water is coming form the tap...AGAIN DISAPPOINTMENT. Later we asked for a finger bowl and they provide it.
4: Conclusion- Ordered food as home delivery, and enjoy it.

Before I write anything degrading, I want people to know that I'm well aware of the expectations and the burden of responsibility that every restaurant bears when dealing with customers. No food chain, no matter how big, would compromise with the known checklist called customer satisfaction, especially when food is involved. 
Strangely, it seems that naushijaan, a restaurant with such 'high' standards has completely forgotten this mantra. And that too in exponential steepness. 
So I, along with my friends decided to have some awadhi luncheon one afternoon. Nothing wrong with that. Having never tried naushijaan before, we thought of giving it a try. 4 chicken biryanis, one chicken tikka masala along with one chicken chap looked like a safe play. So we ordered for a home delivery and sat waiting. Everything was fine TILL the delivery boy showed up, on a rugged bicycle, carrying our food in a DIRTY carry- bag. O.. kay. 
Then the price. Here on zomato, the chicken biryani was of rs. 100. In reality, it suddenly became 125. Okay again. 
Then the food. Believe me, after eating the chicken chap I wanted to throw up. Tikka masala was average and blunt. Not to mention the biryanis, too dry. Like tooooooo dry. You get my point. 
Quantity wise, scarce is the word. Tiny balls of chicken filled the tikka masala and suddenly the money spent on chicken became money spent on onion gravy. 
Please naushijaan, if you read this, do give a couple of thoughts on better quantity as well as quality, good delivery system and a price tag which doesn't hurt a load. 
Hope to hear from you soon. 
Enjoy!

The only good thing about the place is the top floor, which has a very unique nawabi seating arrangement. There are no chairs, you have to be seated on gaddi. If you are a big group of over 12 to 15 members then you can ask the manager to make arrangements there. Now coming to the food, while some of my friends didn’t like the Handi Biryani here, I have to say that I was quite fascinated by the concept of Palak Biryani which tasted good. A little overpriced compared to the quality they serve Naushijaan is one restaurant for couples looking for a sit-back ambience.

I don't know which one was worse the food,  or a cook who doesn't know diff between fresh and stale ( I surely hope he had a blocked nose, otherwise it's either plain stupidity or arrogance ) ,  a manager who thinks it's important that they think the food is fresh ( mind you apparently the customers opinion seems unimportant - that's my conclusion)... There are string of abuses running thru my head but it's afterall a public forum... And just because the food and experience suffered tonight doesn't mean I don't sleep well. 

We ordered their famous handi biriyani,  mutton chaap, chicken chaap,  chicken boti gravy,  mutton boti gravy,  laccha paratha,  shahi tukra 

Biriyani - wasn't what it was made out to be... Frankly reviews got me there... Wasn't bad.. But not the exception that I conceived it would. But that's a difference in pallette opinion
Laccha paratha - do not order as you will plain paratha... That's their idea of laccha 
Mutton chaap - stale...smelling... 

Food is less than average in terms taste,  quality and bad attitude of staff... Certainly not recommended...

In spite of being located within two kilometers from my home, Naushijan has failed to deliver an order place 1.5 hours ago. Every time we call we are told that it will reach in 15 minutes. We have called thrice. Initially we were told 30-45 minutes delivery time based on which we went ahead with placing the order. Appalling really what restaurants that become well known think they can get away with.

Update: Our food was delivered over 2 hours late and once we opened the container realised we had been given chicken instead of the fish tikka masala we had ordered. Never ordering from this place again.

I had recently taken to go these two items - mutton handi biriyani and chicken naushijaan biriyani. The quality was average but the price compared to the mutton and chicken pieces is huge. Also the restaurant is so dirty specially the counter and the kitchen full of flies. I have not seen such dirtiest rrstaurant pricing 200 bucks for each plate of biriyani. Its almost like a street fast food biriyani corner..but price is like hifi restaurant. Even the arsalan biriyani which is so famous in kolkata is less costly than this.

This restaurant does not have an impressive decor but as they say looks can be deceptive sometimes. They serve one of the best kebabs at par with oudh 1590. Lucknowi paratha and galawti kebab is a must try. You can gorge on the jugalbandi kebab which is chicken kebab stuffed with minced mutton. The handi biriyani is its speciality. Carefully cooked, the aroma will definitely pacify your taste buds. If you are in south kolkata you must definitely visit this place for its kebabs and biriyani.

On the last day of the Durga puja, got food packed from Naushijaan. Must say that got quick service in delivering the food. Got 3 large mutton handi biriyani and a few preparations of chicken. Must say the food was good. I would say the biriyani was better than Lazeez which is also nearby. But there were a few little glitches like the mutton biryani had small residue pieces of chicken in all three, the alu was missing in one, which really upsets me, as one doesn't expects this when I am choosing for something which is a little higher from the ordinary. Otherwise the food is enjoyable.

We went there around 12.30pm to avoid the crowd and there was not a single person. The thing is the previous day being astami, they were open till the wee hours in the morning and hence the delay. Could not provide us with cold water, but I am willing to let that go knowing the rush. We ordered Jugalbandi kebab and Lucknowi Paratha and one small Handi mutton Biriyani and two Sweet Lime Soda. The Jugalbandi is really a new thing and I am quite fond of it (this was my second time here), Lucknowi Parathas are quite big in size but not the best in the city, and the Biriyani was sufficient and nice. Most of the restaurants ruin the Sweet Lime Soda but they made it just perfect.

Truth be told, when I finally tasted it, it was at most average.. Extremely spicy, too spicy for a biriyani, copious amounts of aator and garnishing spices were present.. They did give two chicken pieces in one plate, but that is the only good thing about it.. Won't return there again..

The food of Naushijaan is by far one of the best that I've tasted in recent times. Delicately and dedicatedly made, you get the taste of the sincerity with which the chef prepared it from the first bite. The Galauti kebab was one of the finest and so was the handi biriyani. The rest of the menu consisted of all the usual mix of a Mughlai/Indian joint. The parathas I must mention was softest of the lot! You can actually eat it with one hand. On the whole I would give it 3.5 rating. The points deducted was for the stingy ambience with too less light and the filthy washroom. The services can also be made a bit faster.

Went to Naushijaan today, 15th August, for lunch.... Have been hearing about this mughlai joint for some time and so decided to try it today... It's located bang on the Ruby connector and is easy to find.. The decor was very ordinary with dirty stairs leading upto a small room with about  7-8 tables... There were only 2 waiters who  seemed to hv no idea on the specialities on the menu and so we decided to order without any help from the waiters...

We ordered mutton galouti kababs, chicken seekh kabab, mutton handi biryani , rumali rotis and firni.. The galoutis were soft and tender and tasty, though a bit oily, would hv loved it more minus the oily part.. Chicken seekh was extremely dry and a little coarse, also bland for my liking... The handi mutton biryani came in an earthern pot and hence was hot... They said it was cooked in desi ghee and it really showed... The mutton was tender and juicy and the aroma was good too.. I liked it but as I said it's cooked in desi ghee, hence the ghee surely made its mark... Would hv preferred if it would hv been a bit lighter on the ghee.

I can recommend it to friends if they want to go to a new mughlai place other than the arsalan's, shriraz's or royal's.. But this Naushijaan surely has a long way to go if it wants to create its own mark.

This is the place which introduced Kolkata to Galoti Kababs and parathas. A typical Awadhi restaurant which serves you mouth watering kababs. The galoti kababs are better than many fine dining restaurants in the city. Though the ambiance is not great to go with family and friends yet the food is something that you will remember for a long time. It is better to take parcel from this place and enjoy the food at home. The galoti kababs just melt in your mouth and the aroma of the spices and condiments lingers in your mouth for a long long time. I simply gorge on the kababs and the parathas are sweet and soft which enhances the experience of eating the kababs. The biryani is average but the quantity is good enough.

Handi biriyani and Galawti kabab.. Was better than the rest.. They should improve their service.. And the quality of the food.. Their food is half as tasty as it used to be..

Had food from Naushijaan after a long span. Was really surprised to see such a drastic fall in food quality. Ordered for galauti kebab, paratha, handi biriyani and chicken tandoori. Parathas were tasting just like roadside ones, while the quality of biriyani was much below average. I had been visiting this place since they have opened. They were best in Kolkata, but now unfortunately I feel they are below average. Will never have food from here. Thanks......

Quite an ordinary restaurant with kebabs and the best biriyani... yes, you heard it right... the Handi Biriyani is awesome-really light, less oily but awesome taste. Firni, that we had as dessert is really good, we took more than one for each one of us !!!!
The ambiance though is a turn off as are the side dishes.. but you could definitely give it a try if you are a biriyani buff not caring much about the place you are having it.

The restaurant is not such a flashy one, and it is does not have a very good ambiance to sit and eat there. but still you can use the take away, and even if you wish to dine in, then you will definitely forgive everything else, after having the kebabs . they are awfully delicious. But you can only go there for the kebabs as the rest of the items are not such up to the scratch as rest of the big restaurants. The price is also on the lower side, which is a big advantage

Since this place is very near to my house I haven't actually tried their dine in, but always have them home delivered.
Their home delivery is very punctual,crisp in taking orders on phone and the most importantly they don't lie about the timing of delivering.
Coming to food..as many have already spoken about their kebabs...I too echo it..its hands down the best.I have had kebabs in many places but Naushijan's Galawti is THE BEST.it just literally melts into your mouth flavored with the correct amount of spices.Next good thing is their biriyani...mind it many people have said they didnt like it..I guess they didn't try the handi biriyani....go for it instead of the regular one.I love they way they pack it.Therir masala kulchas are also awesome,they are far far better than the ones offered at other tandoor places.Couple it with a plate of mutton kasha or rogan josh..the effect is heavenly.Another very good fact about their food is,its never hard on your stomach,the normal feeling we have after eating rich indian foods it missing here.I guess its their medium of oil/ghee.Even after having so many things I dint feel it.
So whenever we feel like having lucknowi cuisine..its Naushijaan

A quite new restaurant located in Kasba, Naushijaan is a North Indian cuisine restaurant. Ordered from here today as my exams finished today, so decided to give it a try. The experience was not satisfactory at all.

Food is no good, Mutton Biryani is just about average. Kebabs like Malai Kebab is fine but Tandoori Chicken is very spicy. Mutton Chaap is dry and is very bad in taste, so not at all recommended. Chicken Bharta was the only dish that had some taste. Overall the food is not very good and also very spicy.

Quantity is a very big problem as they shell out very little and charge huge amount of bills. Our bill came exactly Rs.1400 (for family for four) which is not at all accepted after looking at the quantity. The Chicken Bharta was so little that only two people could have it. Kebabs were very small.

Home delivery service is descent, and it takes an about hour or so.

So, overall a not so recommended restaurant. However there is a huge scope for improvement of their food items.

This place was recommended by a few friends. Ordered home delivery last week. Food was very ordinary, rather below expectations. The chicken kali mirch tikka kabab was pathetic. The chicken pieces were covered with masala and was floating in juices. You could actually feel the ground masala in your tounge. The chicken chap was nowehere close to what we are used to from Shiraz or Arsalan. They should name this dish something else. The Biriyani handi was sufficient quantity. Smelled a lot of ghee in it. Taste was very average. The food from this place is nothing to remember or talk about. Better places to eat than this. For biriyani in south Kolkata, you might even try out the Biriyani Company around Menoka cinema hall. Its a good alternative to Zeeshan or Bedwin. Wont recommend Naushiajaan to anyone.

Lucknawi cuisine is about subtle spices, wonderful aroma and heavenly flavour and Naushijaan proposes to provide same to the people of Kolkata!  The Biriyani therefore is available (and cooked, I suppose)  in a handy with all its aroma packed inside. The Biriyani is light and gently spiced so that it doesn't create  any unnecessary impediments once ingested. Yes, the special alu, though not a speciality of lucknawi Biriyani, is also present. The best, in my opinion though,  are the kebabs that you can see being grilled over hot coals right at the entrance to this place. The kali Mirch ka murga that is such a rage in Lucknow and can be found in the bylanes of Lucknow is available here too. The taste, though by no means inferior, didn't give me the "WOW" effect that I had witnessed while tasting the same for the 1st time, many years back, in a shop close to Lucknow railway station. 

The restaurant could do with a little bit of exterior make-over and though the building has been painted a refreshing white recently, the hanging wires in the front of the building spoils the view. 

Overall,  a good place to take away kebabs and Biriyani and eat them in the comfort of one's home..

Naushijaan has restored my faith that there are indeed places in Kolkata that serve excellent Biryani. Like many others I have tried biryani from other biggies like Arsalan, Zeeshan, Alibaba, Shiraz, Rahmania,  Khawab etc. Most of them, with their overly generous dose of oil and dalda, are a strict no-no for my palate. I like it simple. The Biryani should speak for itself - and a properly cooked one should be aromatic, subtly spiced and therefore medium flavored. If Biryani is properly cooked, there shouldn't be a need for side dishes - and I found Naushijaan's Handi Biryani apt to this definition. It was a day of celebration at our home, and I went overboard with the order: 2 x Murgh Mussalam, 1 x Naushijaan Spcl. Handi, 1 x Kofta Biryani, 1 x Keema Biryani, 2x Mutton Handi Biryani, 3 x Galawti Kabab, 2 x Chicken Malai Tikka and 1 x Chicken Afghani. Order total: INR 2900.
Murgh Mussalam needs to be ordered a day before. However, I placed the order at around 11.30 a.m and insisted that it was important for me as I had promised it at home - and after a bit of to and fro, the manager was extremely accommodating in being able to get it done by the delivery time of 7 pm. We sampled a variety of Biryanis just to see what was best. My take is that the plain Mutton Handi Biryani comes out at the top. There's nothing too 'special' about the other types. Keema Biryani seemed to be Biryani mixed with Galawti Kabab. Murgh Mussalam was extremely delicious but not extraordinary. The Galawti Kabab, was an absolute delight. Incredibly soft with the right amount of flavor - an ideal companion to the Handi Biryani. Personally, I'd like the top and bottom shells of the Kabab to be a little more fried/crispy keeping the filling soft as usual.
To make it short, try Naushujaan's Handi Biryani (Mutton) and Galwti Kabab. But avoid eating it there - 'cos we saw the reviews about the decor etc. and decided to take away. Forget the decor, forget the ambience and just indulge yourself in the best Biryani and Galwti Kabab in town !

I visited Naushijaan few weeks back ..... infact on the day when Yusuf Pathan hit 72 in 22 balls in IPL 2014 and KKR secured 2nd spot in top four :P ...... we watched the whole game there only .... enjoying our dinner :)
Coming to food, here the biriyani i should say is not the typical bengali style biriyani like u get in Arsalan and so many other places ...... Nausijaan's biriyani would taste a bit different .... the lucknow flavour is evident ...... Infact they give a lot of ghee in biriyani ...... We tried all the three special biriyanis  i.e Handi biriyani, Parda biriyani and Naushijaan's special biriyani  ...... though they claim that each dish serves 2-3 people, but i would differ ..... maybe 2 dishes would suffice 3 people(on an avg.) , and if u r a big foodie like me, u can finish 1 plate easily ....... :) ....  In Parda biriyani, the whole biriyani is covered with a white 'parda' ..... and they will tear the 'parda' open and then serve the biriyani underneath it , to you ...... :)
For the side dishes, we took Dampakt chicken and Handi chicken .....  tasted quite average ,not bad of course, but not exceptional too ....
The ambience inside is not that good i should say .... but the view from the 1st floor ,being on the Gariahat -Bypass connector , is good .....
I would recommend this place to the biriyani lovers only if u want a change from a typical bengali preparation biriyani ......

I went to this place last evening for a takeaway (read/heard its dine-in and decor is not all that great). Firstly, locating this place was quite easy by following zomato map (Google map was little wrong), but alas, the shop's signboard was
not working correctly, so, "N" was switched off.

It was nearly empty around 7.30pm and ordered handi biriyani , the famous one, with dessert as firni/sahi tudkra.
The delivery was little slow, as they were too busy in home delivery bills. 

Anyway, coming to the most important part, the food, was average to say least. The handi biriyani seems little too dry and spicy. Also, the chicken pieces were NOT biriyani style cut, rather normal cut pieces. The rice was average as well.
Overall, not a very good experience.

Firni was great, and Sahi tukra was also fine, not mouth-watering. 

They have opened a new outlet in circus avenue, named lucknow, and another new one in coming up in Ballygunge circular road, So, I believe,the best cooks have moved to newer places. That's my guess.

Maybe, I need to try out the jugalbandi kabab next time in lucknow, but its not enticing me anymore after yesterday's experince. Lets see.

I have tried almost all the biriyanis over here except prawn. The reviews are as follows:
Parda biriyani - This is basically a type of dum biriyani in lucknow style. made with ghee and good amount of spices. taste is soso.
handi biriyani - Plain biriyani with ghee n aloo. i liked its taste better than parda.
biriyani naushijaan - this is the first time i had biriyani with palang saak. but it's not bad. the taste and smell is quite good. i can say this would be tryable if u want to like experiments. 
but for all of them the quantity is not sufficient. they should think about this. the behavior of waiters and stuffs are also good.

The low profile of its decor and ambiance is surpassed by the quality of food they serve. The biryani I had at Naushijaan is by far the best I ever had at any restaurant in Kolkata. It is simply the best. Possibly I have dine at this restaurant only once and have ordered for doorstep delivery several times (mostly at my office in Rajarhat). Believe it or not, they have lived upto the expectations always. My favourites here are Chicken Lahori, Galawti Kebab, Mutton Handi Biryani, and Mutton Boti Masala. I highly recommend this restaurant to all Biryani lovers to visit at least once to have a delightful taste of Lucknawi culinary.

The highly acclaimed restaurant serves excellent mughlai and lucknawi dastarkhwan. They have some unique items like the brilliant kofta biriyani which is excellent by all standards albeit a bit too liberal with the chillies. Anyone who can't tolerate hot and spicy are well advised to sample the same with caution. The galawti is just as good as the tunday kebabi of Lucknow's Aminabad.  However the pasinda is a bit of a let down as it lacked flavour and was a trifle too dry. All over a good restaurant.

I first visited this place in November 2010 with my cousin and was really  taken in by the food….in fact, I thought it offered the best Mughlai in town. The kababs (we opted for Sheek and Kakori) were succulent, the handi biriyani aromatic and the chicken masala very tasty. The next time in August 2011 we went for home delivery….the food was well-appreciated once again. However, recently when I ordered the kabab platter which had 5 different types of kabab I was disappointed to find that the standard had dipped a bit. Some of the kababs were not well-cooked, particularly the Galouti kabab which was almost crumbling. I hope the management takes notice and buckle up.

Remember your mother warned you about street food? Unhygienic, not clean etc etc. But the stuff always tasted heavenly. Naushijaan is a similar experience. Was here nearly a year ago, the lingering taste of some melt in mouth galawatis, the lucknowi parathas both of which give Tunde some stiff competition.

The food continues to be tasty. Generally they handle mutton better than chicken. Avoid the Mirchi ka salan - it has a miniscule amount of mince stuffed in large chillies. Run miles from the Phirni. The rest of the menu tastes better than similar places - such as the slightly more up market Oudh. The chilli paratha , while is good I prefer the one in  Mirch Masala

But there are problems.....This outlet is scruffy to put it politely. The grubby staircase that leads up to a barely clean dining room... Serving time is an issue and the pricing does not justify the ambience.

But what the hell ignore the health warnings, go and gorge yourself.......

Worst place in Kasba to have dinner as per my experience-- this review is based on a year back when I have visited this place.
the starters were ok , then came the rotis and mutton dishes.
God, the taste was as if the mutton pieces were dipped in hot water--the gravy had no taste at all.
Even the staff himself came to us seeing our faces and tasted the gravy infront of us--and the comment he gave "Sir, how are you having such a tasteless gravy?'--they gave fresh Roghan josh gravy--just some pinches of salt were added, the taste was the same. 
Would have rated 1 but gave 2 because of the staff who came to us himself to take the complain.
Just avoid this place.
            

My previous rating was 2.0 based on the visit in 2014.
I heard that the place has improved.
So i ordered Mutton Handi Biryani and Chicken Zafrani Tandoori via home delivery.
The Chicken Zafrani tandoori was stale and the chicken had a bad smell
However the Mutton Handi Biryani was good , the mutton pieces were succulent and soft, the flavor of rice was nice. So I am changing my rating to 3.

My suggestion is : order handi biryani from them and for tandoor and side items try some other places.

Chap is just excellent. its always good when you have it in the restaurant but not ordered in home. I have observed difference in parcel. For parcel you can have kabaabs. .Now newly going through a make over. I have recently tried out quite number of Awadhi Style restaurants and nobody seems to be nearly to NAUSHIJAAN!

Naushijaan - Ahh!! Yes, they are unique. A unique Mughlai Experience altogether. 
========================================================================
Intro:

Naushijaan was visited with my brother yesterday when we were planning around to have some good biriyani. As i stay in new alipore, there are not much good biriyani joints nearby. So we went out of the way to try Naushijaan hearing about its famous Handi Biriyani. Well, when you head from gariahat towards ruby, it falls on the left side of the main road after crossing lazeez express and Sbi Bank. I had seen it previously but i could not recognise where there place is perfectly located at. As soon as i visited this place, i was really surprised by the get up of the place specially the exteriors which made you feel like you are entering a Lucknow Biriyani place. Well, as i entered inside, i was made to head towards the first floor. Well, the ambience of the first floor wasn't too great: Dark shaded walls and even the Menu design was more like a paper laminated in plastic. Well, apart from these two flaws i could not find any other flaws in Naushijaan. However, the prices here are kept quite reasonable. As i was going up, i could see the photo of the famous music director and composer Pritam who have had his food at Naushijaan.  
========================================================================

Food Ordered: 

1) Chicken Malai Kebab - There were 5 juicy pieces of chicken pieces which were moderately tender but was perfectly marinated as i could feel the spices in every bite. It was very courteous of the stewards to serve us properly. I was expecting 6 pieces. Well, never mind. The green chutney should have had a little sweet tinge to it and a little more curd was required in the chutney. 

2) Handi Biriyani - Here comes the fun, the Chicken Biriyani was served to us in Matka Handi and when the matka was opened, i could see all the smoky hot flavors and aromas which were dum cooked were coming out. I just could keep my nose nearby and could enjoy the aroma. It was soothing and different. There were two pieces of chicken and one potato. I ordered the half plate which costed me 170 bucks as we first wanted to try it. It was too good. The Aloo was perfectly hot and steamed with aromas all stuffed inside. Not just that, the chicken pieces were also quite succulent. The aroma of the biriyani was hitting right the nose and tasted quite different and Not the usual stuff at all which quite impressed me. 

3) After getting impressed by the Handi Chicken biriyani, i had placed an order for the usual chicken biriyani which costed 100 bucks. There was just a slight tinge of difference in taste and the handi one was much much more hotter!

4) We ended our meal with ordering one firni to taste. The firni here was quite different. It was prepared with Saffron for sure as the taste said me. It was too good but the portion was too small.  ========================================================================
What i noticed:

1) Never Judge a book by its cover- Here, Naushijaan by its interiors.
2) Hospitality was seen right here. 
3) Food was served hot and not in a hurry.
========================================================================
Pros:
1) Good exteriors done.
2) Courteous stewards.
3) Prompt service. 
4) Extra ordinary Taste of Biriyani Rice.
5) Perfectly marinated and cooked chicken and Potato. 
6) Reasonably priced. 
7) Firni was unique too. 
8) The Handi Biriyani is a must try. 


Cons:
1) Bad interiors.
2) Badly designed Menu/A la Carte.

A bit disappointed with their paranthas...which were nothing but masala kulchas stuffed with mutton/chicken.



----- 27 Feb, 2014 -----

kebabs are good.The much touted stuffed parathas were not so great.

heard a lot about this place from friends... finally went and saw a work in progress restaurant. 
Dosent matter, pack your food, go home and enjoy. Tried the handi biryani and verdict is that arsalan has been dfefeated as the best biryani joint in kolkata. The mutton boties just melt in your mouth, as regards to the rice that its so tasty i feel the rice is heavily battered and cooked with mutton fat only. Anyways my mouth is watering as i write this. 

P.S. as i was leaving I saw an amazing slow grilled whole mutton thigh being taken by a waiter with juices dripping. I asked the owner the name and she smiled and said its mutton musallam. Anyways until next time...

This is my second visit to this place, after a gap of almost a year. I opted for a takeaway this time, though. It was nice to see that they have revamped the looks and decor - both from the outside and inside. However, even after it does not give the appearance of a very classy place. But who cares for such a trifle, if the biryani is good - saluting the spirit of a true Bangali Foodie! 

We opted for the special handi biryani, a chicken stuffed(!) kebab and a chicken side dish. The kebab was slightly  average, a bit dry but the taste was not bad. The side dish was diced cut chicken in a very tasty gravy. But the Biryani still very, very good. I still remember the unique taste of Naushi Jahan biryani I had a year back, and it still ticked all the boxes for me. The handi will feed at least 2 if not 3 people (it has 4 mutton pieces). The amount was a bit overwhelming for the 2 of us, but  we stuffed ourselves with it without a pang of guilt or regret! And unlike some Biryani joints of the city, our tummies did not complain at all - it was light and hearty. 
For the uninitiated, the biryani may lack Aloo and has a flavour of the famed Dhakai biryani which I am fortunate enough to taste. It has a unique flavour to it and biryani lovers will not be disappointed.

Service was decent, a bit slow, but acceptable as we went for a weekday lunch. Prices are reasonable. I'll go with a 3.5 for this joint.

I would have given it a four but the interior was really bad, dirty and shabby (and I am really not that picky, seriously!!). But seating area was kinda nice that the tables were clean and not greasy. The food was quick to arrive. The Mutton biriyani was really really good. Very flavorful without being greasy and cumbered with spices. moist and delicious!! the mutton chap was a bit unusual with crumbly stuff which i quite didn't recognize. but the taste was very good and very generous. Overall, a good experience. The biriyani here I would rank 2nd place after Arsalan.

You will get variety of Briyani in this place which you might like or might not. Coz in calcutta we generally had almost similar type of biriyani everywhere. Nauahijaan make the handi briyiani which is very tasty and light (served in Handi) that make it different from others. They also make verieties of biriyanis which is not available in all places. Again i am saying that u might like or might not. Me and my frnd Saptarshi had tried Kofta handi biriyani (check the pic) which we liked. The biriyani consist of peices of mutton kofta and gravy. Do not forget to have firni. It was really really delecious (check the pic). Try once, if u like to try new thing.

Do not expect a great ambience from this place...

After a long long time have i tasted a good Biriyani in town. The Handi Biriyani is definitely the one to taste, it is just wonderful. The normal biriyani isnt that great, its like all others. So i would definitely suggest the Handi Biriyani to all the biriyani lovers, it would not dissapoint you. 

You can also try the tandoori chicken/mutton chap. Both of them are really good. Am not saying you would find an entire different kind of tandoor nor any exceptional taste, just that the spices are well mixed and to right proportions (to my taste buds :P). 

There is nothing more to it.....Handi Biriyani and Mutton Chap and one can start off with Tandoor Chicken. The quantity of Biriyani is really good. Its available in 2 quantities.

Awesome!Simply awesome !I just can't find words to describe the heavenly taste!
We located the place using Nokia here maps,otherwise its difficult,because the place has no big sign. We ordered mutton gulwati, kakori, pasinda kebab and mutton handi biryani. The gulwati and kakori kebab melted in mouth,leaves a hot and spicy taste! But the pasinda, the long pieces of heaven, was taken us away with the hot spicy taste and smell! The meat has a good texture and juicy taste. Handi biryani - they actually served an earthen 'handi' with its mouth wrapped in aluminium foil. The mutton was softly cooked to the bones! Finally the sweet lime soda gave a good support to all the dishes!
Will go back soon with more foodies!

This is one of those places where you don't judge, you just stuff yourself. It is a hidden treasure. The Biriyani here is my personal favorite as they prepare it differently, you don't feel like you are eating the same staple you are used to you get surprised with each bite. The Handi Biriyani besides coming in adorable personal mini-handi's is THE BEST. You can smell the ghee and the meat is tender. The Kebabs are flavorful especially the Malai Tikka kebab and the Galawati Kebab, melts in your mouth. I am eagerly waiting to try the other delicacies !

I had heard a lot about Naushijaan from my friends and one day I decided to visit this place. The interior is not that good and the service wasa bit slow. We had ordered kebabs which was pretty decent, but the paneer kebab which my friend had ordered wasn't that nice. There was no taste and it was bland. But the chicken preparation was outstanding. Coming to the Biriyani, we had ordered chicken biriyani and not the handi biriyani. Maybe this was our mistake. As the chicken biriyani was really bad. It was too dry and there was no taste. Even small local joints make better chicken biriyani than this. Next time I would like to try the handi biriyani. Overall it is an average place.

An obscure building hides this treasure trove of kebabs. When you go to a joint like this you cannot be that bothered about ambience... And you have to make do with very basic stuff.  It's not a place for romantic evenings but for the serious meat eater. 

The great variety of brilliant kebabs will enthrall and endear most people. And then comes the handi  biriyani.... Cooked in ghee it offers you a very different tickle for your taste buds. 

Round of any evening work the Shahi tukra which is served hot and is quite nice.

The first time we went to this restaurant we were extremely unimpressed by the ambiance. The service was also not something to die for. In fact, we found the waiters extremely lousy and the entire place to be somewhat dirty. Grudgingly we ordered food. After what seemed an eternity the food arrived, just as we were cursing the place and contemplating on whether we should leave.

Our expectation was very low and we just wanted to gobble the food and quickly leave. However, we were completely bowled out from the first bite itself. The biryani that we ordered was just out of the world. The aroma of the spices seemed to have created a brilliant symphony in creating a dish that was fascinating as far as taste and smell was concerned. The meat was tender and well-cooked.  Undoubtedly, this was one of the best biryanis that I had ever tasted. 

Next arrived the dish for which I will tell all of you to visit Naushijaan at least once in life. It’s their galoti kabab. It is so soft and amazingly yummy that once you put it in your mouth, it simply melts, without the least effort from your part to even chew it. I tried this kabab in many well-known places as well but none of them even come close to the galoti of Naushijaan. 
We often visit Naushijaan for the delightful cuisines it offers. The service continues to be bad and the ambiance has gone from bad to worse. But each time we go there we are left marveling at the fascinating recipes these guys manage to come up with. Their Lucknowi paratha, mutton chaap and chicken korma deserve special mention. However, no matter what we order the galoti kaab remains a constant, which we never ever fail to try. 

If you haven’t tried the food at Naushijaan you surely have missed out on a great deal in life... And for a food lover you simply cannot afford to let that happen.

I have been observing this place for quite a few years and my first experience 2 years back for the Handi biryani was not very enthralling. It felt like normal cooked biryani placed in a Handi container and served. Fast forward to few days back. I was looking for a new place for trying out biryani and kababs and someone suggested Naushijaan. My prior experience did not allow me to take the risk but my curiosity got the better of me and we ordered from this place. First comment - the extension to get through is very troublesome. There should be a provision of a direct number. I was informed that home delivery was possible but would take 1-2 hours because all delivery boys were apparently out to remote areas. However they were willing to serve in 10-15 minutes flat if we ordered and picked up from their place. Being the more suitable option, I went ahead and picked up from the restaurant. And I was so glad I did!!!!

Handi Biryani: Nothing like the one I had experienced. It was juicy and had a tremendous flavor. The mutton pieces were really really really soft (deserves the repeated words). The quantity was enough for 2 people. (I had ordered the double handi)

Parda Biryani: This was a gravy like biryani wrapped in a flour layer and was even more tasty than the Handi version. Again the mutton pieces were amazing and also the taste was distinctly different.

Gelawati Kabab: Very good

Burrah Marinate: Meat quality was excellent, dish was very well cooked. 

Though the external appearance and algorithm to get food is not up to the mark, the taste really deserves a visit. Please keep the quality intact!!

Cool restaurant with typical taste of Biryani. Not something great. What I must talk about is the Gelawati Kabab. Very well prepared with the right mix of spices. Althought I am not comparing that to what I taste in Lucknow still it is one of the best you get in Kolkata. 

Hope to visit again soon.

Ok new how do I begin, its very difficult to spot this place. No proper sign board, the place looks dilapidated. And I must have crossed this place a million times because I thought it is a shut down restaurant  or something . What made me stop is that I was stuck in a traffic jam and i smelt coal... The tandoor being lit is a fragrance that is very cose to my heart. and it called me ... 

I went in and decided to to look at the menu but I noticed the open kitchen and the walls of the reception ... the once off white walls are now brown with soot... really unappetizing to look at. especially with an name like Naushijaan . 

coming to food ... 

The gelawati kebab ... The softest i have had in the city but not at par with what i have had in Delhi and Lucknow . 
but pretty good none the less ... 

The kakoris were very average. I have a feeling they use very old meat and the kakori needs to be minced at least 5 times...  it was a kakori but with a texture of a shikampuri kebab... but it was tasty nonetheless. 

The burrah marinate was brilliant ... the best i have had in  ages... but it was tad bit under cooked.. I liked the fact the the marrow in the spinal cavity was still soft, creamy, and very flavorful speaks for the quality of meat used which is top notch .

The biriyani was brilliant. It dint have too much rose water or itter... in fact the notes of javitiri (mace) and eiaichi (cardamom) were beautiful ... The biriyani was not made in dalda ... THANK GOD !

The service is awfully slow.. 

humble request to the owner... please repaint the place ... it needs a maintenance BADLY !

The best Biriyani in Kolkata, in my opinion. The Handi Biriyani is flavoured with Ghee, tastes the best.
And the Mutton Rara, the champion. Just fab.

The air-condition machines were not on, and it was a very humid day. But the very polite waiters made it up.

We availed their take away service. Had their Naushijan Special Lucknowi Handi Biryani, the name went something like that. Must say, the freshness in the taste was a much needed one. 

The tried and tasted formula of serving the same old biryani in Kolkata's restaurants was starting to get a bit dull.
But, here Naushijaan made an exception, they tried something different, and they have a winner in their hands.

Tasted " different " from the word go. The taste was enhanced with the aroma of ghee. The flavor was one to remember.
They reinvented the boring biryani, truly they are innovators in this department. 

PS:  I don't like their kebabs though !!!!

I had been to Naushijaan. From a friend I got to know that the Biriyani is good.  So me and my husband went there. We ordered special hand Biriyani. First of all the interior was very poor, they took a long time to serve. And above all the taste of Biriyani was not good at all. And quantity also not sufficient. Overall not satisfied.

i ordered a home delivery for brunch today.here is my view on their items,decide for yourself.

handi biryani-we took two chicken handi biryani,the regular one meant for one person.2small pieces of chicken,oily and not really aromatic. priced or rather,overpriced at 170.i guess they decided to pice the clay pot at rs 60.

gulati kebab-had heard about them a lot lately,so was curious.tasted good,but again,two moderate pieces came at a price of rs 120. 

chicken platter-priced at rs 275,two tangri kebab,and two other types of chicken kebabs,each in pairs,at this outrageous rate.
taste-nothing great at all

If you wanna have a feast of kebab then Naushijaan is the place where you need to come. It is indeed what i would say a paradise for kebab lovers. A few days back i was treating some friends of my club and thats when they mentioned to me why not try out the grub at Naushijaan. 
So here is how we all landed up. Well ordered the following kebabs 

Tikka Butter Masala
Galawti kebab 
Pasinda 
Chicken Malai Kofta 
sheek kebab stuffed parattha 
Chicken palak 
Paneer Kalimirch 

I can tell you after orders these dishes we were not disappointed at all. The real stand out of the order was the Galawti Kebab.The deco was ok, service staff were nice and hospitable and went out of their way to make us comfortable. 

Definitely would like to recommend this restro to others who love eating kebabs and mughlai  food.

Okay so here goes the detailed review. I had my lunch alone for the first time here when I was crossing the area towards bye pass. I was so hungry and quickly reckoned that my colleagues told me about this place and I called them up for a quick guidance on the menu they have. I was suggested to have Handi biriyani with Galauti kebab and nothing else is required. Believe me it's a must try combination and by true means it doesn't require any side dish at all. Mesmerized biriyani cooked in desi ghee with tender pieces of mutton. Galauti kebab prepared from minced mutton which melts in your mouth. Quantity for Handi biriyani is sufficient for a person if ordered half. Also, I had the chance to sit on the 2nd floor which has a different arrangement with designer curtains on the ceiling and one has to sit on the carpet to eat with low height tables in front of them. One of my favorite place for biriyani feast.

This place makes one of the best biriyanis in Kolkata. Period. But the service is not that good. Place also needs urgent renovation. But if one is a biriyani afficionado, then this place is one to be. Try the 'handi' biriyani. They also give home delivery. Happy with biriyani, not so happy with the place.

this used to be my favourite place for biryani and galauti kebab.this is also the only eatery which makes such soft amazing parathas and the super special galauti kebab.
well it used to be so.last three visits, one just two days back confirned the fall in quality. The galauti is not fried to its optimum level . The rice in biryani is not fine and the meat pieces are just bones.this after reminding them of the deterioration. hope they improve and my next experience is like what it was 6 months back.

Now I edit this review after 2 years. 
And the quality has gone down substantially while the price is sky high. 
The same paratha which was 20/- not so long ago is 40/- now. 
The kebab which was 80/- a plate is 170/- now

Can u beat it?
Add to it the rude behaviour of staff who takes orders over phone. 
It's like u r ordering to us. Pls be thankful. 
I hope the owners are reading this. 
24th night I gave the order to the owner and his voice over phone was same. 
Quality has gone down. The kebab doesn't hold tight anymore and is all over the place. 
That's it. 
Maybe the owners are unaware that now they r not the only place in kol who makes galauti kebabs.

Very liberal of ghee content in their food, this place is well known in the locality for its kebab and north Indian dishes. Ordered a MURGH MUSALLAM (order to be given one day before) and was served well. the dish was tasty, and quality of material is also good. Biryani is nice but u may find better Biryani at other eating joints nearby. Other dishes are also tasty. Overall an average north Indian cuisine restaurant.

Went to NAUSHIJAAN yesterday after a long time. The kebabs were good, cooked to perfection, but the other dishes were really disappointing. The biriyani which used to be a delight is now reduced to rice soaked in ghee, the chaap we ordered was not cooked to perfection. this place has like changed dramatically in a few months from excellent to good. However the kakori, burra and galauti kebabs are worth trying. So rush before they decide to mess up the kebabs too .

If you want to try handi biriyani and mouth melting mutton kebabs then this is the place you must hopp in. Service is too slow but waiters are well behaved. I liked their "Chicken handi biriyani" too good to express the aroma was perfect so do the chicken were tendered and soft must try with raita but before you order handi biriyani you must try two mouth watering mutton kebabs "Galawti" and "Kakori" were simply awsome! Must try dishes. Didn't like "Chicken Afgani" that was below average so do side gravy dishes! Green flag for mutton kebabs and Biriyani must visit and njoy!

I was a regular customer of naushijaan from the beginning as its very close to my house and they used to serve very very good Mughlai food and I tried all the items on their small menu card. They have replaced their old experienced staff with new inexperienced unprofessional staff so the quality of service is decreasing by the day. I used to love their Handi Biriyany very much but now the biriyani is just ghee soaked rice with a small pieces of meat. It has no aroma, no taste, kebabs were great but now the same kababs have become just charred piece of meat! I'm really disappointed by deterioration of this good Mughlai restaurants. 
Giving it 3 stars only because of the great foods they served earlier, now they don't deserve more than 2 stars!

Had ordered Chicken Handi Biryani and Bharta and must say I was taken aback by its taste. Totally worth every penny. I have had biryanis from several places but this one tops the chart.  Perhaps the restaurant looks shady but food wise is a must try. I cannot say much about the ambiance as I did a home delivery and am totally satisfied with the food. Initially I was a bit apprehensive to try the place due to outlooks but don't judge a book by its cover. Try takeaway or home delivery to dig into the Handi.

Just one demerit their home deli. system ain't efficient. I had to call and check the status of my order. A spoiler indeed but may not be the same always so can take a chance!

Visited on August 18, 2012. The Galawti Kebab, Chicken Afghani & Mutton Burra that we ordered were very bad. Even the Garlic Naan was not at all good. I wonder why they claim that they serve Lucknow-ka-khana! 
The ambiance & interior of the restaurant too is not inviting. Do not expect much from the servers, they should be immediately sent for a crash course from those equally untrained servers working in the Dhaba's across Kolkata.
However, the Mutton Halim was really very good and was the only yummy dish we had. 
I am told that the Biryan here is very good and comes in an earthen vessel but after the horrifying food experiences we had here I will have to master enough courage to come here again and get the taste of it... :o[

Had Mutton Handi Biriyani and Kakori Kebab. Both were good, especially the aroma of the Handi Biryani. Mutton pieces were tender and well cooked. Kakori is mouth watering but quantity was not enough.

The place was not very well done. Small and suffocating.
If your budget is limited, you can go and try it once.

Went for lunch and having eaten Avadhi khana in Lucknow I wondered where they got their recipes from?
The kakori was too full of black pepper which overpowered any other aromatic spices if at all  used. It had the texture of Sheekh Kababs not soft and tender like a Kakori. The Gilawati had the same mutton mixture as the Kakori, with perhaps a bit less of the kali mirch.  It was more like a shammi kabab. The Gilawati is supposed to be of a creamy texture which is barely held together, gilawat, is the operative word ! Don't think the Chef has been near a saffron container in the immediate past. 
Mughlai food sans Keshar ????
The Passanda was good though a bit high on the scovil factor  !!  My friend had to order some sugar to help her to deal with this.
The worst item , among those we ordered ,was the "Mutton Boti masala "  The pieces of meat were not larger than half inch cubes and it was quite an insult to be served such tiny teeny pieces of meat  drowning in an insipid onion gravy.  Mughlai food mandates that mutton be cut into large piece so that they remain juicy and succulent. Chef please get your mutton at butchers where they know how to cut meat for a mughlai salan. 

The firni was semi sweet and sticky and had not been set in the clay " sakora " It must have been cooked in a pot and lumped into the little clay containers with an apology of a " chandi ka Vark " on top. The Shahi tukra will give me nightmares tonight. 

The ambience was BAD, had to climb up a set of filthy stairs to reach what ? - one room.  The tables and chairs were like those of  a cheap canteen and though they do not aspire to fine dining..at least the place could display some aesthetic sense.  

I understand they have a take out section for those living in this area, if you must eat pretentious mughlai food please use the take out facility.

The place should be called Nausea ! I wonder what makes them dare to call upon the name of Lucknow ? It would make the Nawabs turn in their graves.

Now for our sorry experience. Ordering food from this place was a true reminder that our sins are to be paid for !

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : Chewy pieces of broiler chicken doused in tomato sauce.
Gilawati Kabab : Soft. But the taste was awful and kind of bitter.
Handi Biryani : Ghee soaked rice. No aroma or flavour. Even the pieces of mutton were not so well cleaned.

The rating above is just for 2 dishes in the whole menu available at this restaurant. They have the best Handi Biriyani and the most delicious & soft Galawti Kabab. Other than these two, one could also try the Tandoori Zafrani chicken. But would not recommend any of the side dishes as they are horrible and totally different.

My rating is for the food only.

This is the best biryani I have eaten - so good, I carried a clay handi home with me on the plane the next morning.

Delicately flavoured with rose essence, a bit heavy on the yummy ghee and served with generous pieces of succulent mutton, the mutton biryani is cooked and served in clay pots. The galawti kabbabs had their melt-in-your-mouth goodness and the firni we tried was too sweet for our liking. 

The ambiance of Naushijaan resturant is nothing worth going back to; small and basic, it is tolerable if you want to eat your biryani piping hot. 

If you prefer yours as take-aways: the biryani did very well micro-waved even the next day: the ghee preserved the moisture and taste after my precious handi travelled coast to coast.

All I would say is that the quality of food (especially the Biryani) is the one or the only thing that stands out for this place compared to the various outlets/competitors of biriyani makers of Kolkata (name any). Their biriyani has a different blend absolutely which anyone would feel at the very first bite and we love it!!!
I don't know much about the service, but I wouldn't doubt that it might not be good considering that I have been in the same place before it was called Naushijaan!! But it's definitely a good take-away counter. I would suggest that one should give it a try...take away only.
My rating would be only for the food.

Weekend gathering is generally with family and friends and people are very happy when they end up with satisfactory food. But in NAUSHIJAAN the things are venerated. We have seat for at least 30mins to place the edict and most minuscule an hour to serve the food that also in single bowl for multiple people. How nice!! If you by mistake request for any value addition they will holler and force you to leave the place. ACs are running like demo piece and no power backup. Please have a second thought to step in such horrible place.

A substandard infrastructure which cannot even serve 20 people. We went together to enjoy a friend's wedding anniversary dinner, they spoiled our mood with very poor quality of food (specially a horrible Biriyani), power cut for a long time and poor service. Our inconveniences were taken very badly with misbehavior and insults by the restaurant body. They did not agree to accept their faults and shouted on us. I have an experience of eating out at many places in our country and abroad, but have never experienced such a rough behavior by the restaurant body. They did not have the minimum expected courtesy of a host.  I'm requesting all to think twice before planning to have a happy hang out in such a place, may result a total mess and wastage of money.
