Their Shawarma is the worst i have tasted in India. You have to throw that in the dustbin. They mix atta and maida in the mayonise and by eating half of the Shawarma, you will feel that your stomach is full and you will feel uneasy

The Shawarma Wrap is quite good. A little more of the white sauce wouldn't hurt. The Chocolate Oreo shake could use a bit more of Oreo. The place is okay. Tiny bit overpriced for me.

Had the most yummilicious Special Chicken Shwarma from this place tonight! The parcel was packed very nicely along with French fries and little bit of Mayo salad.
It was very soft and tasty. More than enough for one person I would say. Cost is reasonable too!

Located right at the front of Metropolis Mall... nothing to mention about there deco except there colour changing sign board and the colorful sample mocktail in mason jar in front of the counter...
They are mainly serving Lebanese preparations...
I simply tried there...
1. Chicken shawarma--- Good but the chicken should be little more soft and mixing will need more expertise... 
2. Mango soda--- Very ordinary... need to be improved... the glass was full of ice rather than mocktail...
Staffs are well behaved and service was fast too...
Pocket pinch was bit high...
