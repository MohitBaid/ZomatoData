tasty food and reasonable price!. Yesterday i ordered masala dosa and lassi both were too good. Place is quite small and it can accommodate 8-10 persons however it well maintained and hygienic. Its a small AC restaurant.

Staff members are polite and are always available to serve you. They frequently visit asking if we need anything else which is lacking in most restaurants today.

Overall i recommend to everyone.
Good price!Good food! neat and clean.

A daily customer ! Love to have " Mango juice " while returning home after a hard day of work . Variety of both sweet & savoury Indian delicacies available. Cordial staff & manager .. Prompt service but would like them to emphasize a little bit more on the neatness ( in a positive way ) !!

Very poor service.. We found hair in the juice.. They gave lemon juice instead of pineapple juice.. Really very bad place. Maintain the quality and service.

Sai Jalpan junction is located at Kestopur. This place mainly serves veg snacks, juices & South Indian food at a pocket friendly price.

Ambience is crowded,  has little seating arrangements .

Service is fast.

Tried Cheese sada dosa, Dhokla & Lassi. 

Dosa was nice.
Dhokla was yummy and nicely made.
Lassi was ok, not great.

A nice place to have snacks at a very pocket friendly rate.

Sai Jalpan is located just Infront of the Kestopur - Mission Bazar auto stand. Very much overcrowded place on VIP road. They serves all most every type of quick bites starting from samosa , Kachuri to South Indian Dosa along with fruit juice. Total Veg restaurant. Have seating arrangements. Very much pocket friendly price. A Paneer Ghee Dosa would cost you around only Rs. 80. It easily can be a good meal for dinner. Nice restaurant for veg food lover and snacks.
