This place is located in Bhawanipur (Chakraberia), near Netaji Bhavan metro station. The place is popular for their excellent collection of sweets. There are no seating arrangements though. A recommended place; if you are in the area and want to buy sweets then this is the ideal place.

This is one of my favourite sweet shop which is located in Bhowanipur, Kolkata.  I had gone there many times. They serve varities of sweets like sadesh, cham cham, rosgolla, goja, kheer chop and many more.  I loved their goja, gulab jamun and rosogulla. All the sweets were of good quality. Prices were very pocket friendly and servicing was quite ok.  This place is highly recommended.

BEWARE! Next time you buy sweets from here make sure they are clean. The last 2-3 times I bought sweets from here, I have got Red Ants free with it. So famous shop, still no proper maintenance.

Brief: I don't know where it is located and i don't know how much do they charge for sweets. From a very long time, one of my uncle who visits my place used to get sweets from this shop and I'm really shocked to see this on Zomato too. He used to get this one same sandesh everytime and i used to eat it. It was a pink colored sandesh with a munacca on top (also known as soggy/kishmish). It was a simple dessert. However, very soft and mouth melting. I am thankful to Zomato to get this sweet shop also into limelight as it was not there since a long time. Pictures are to be updated shortly. :)

I would really like to visit this joint and try out more dishes. :)

A typical Bengali sweet shop with a difference.The thing that stands out as far as this place is concerned is that it offers good quality products comparable with the much more renowned( and for that matter expensive) sweet shops at much cheaper prices.
It is located in a lane opposite jadubazar in Bhawanipur.A smallish shop with a quite a decent variety on offer.My personal favourites here are the rabri and the shor bhaja.The rabri is absolutely delicious and the price is also very reasonable.It is definitely worth a try.
The typical smosas and sandeshes and rasgollas are also quite nice.This is a very decent place to have good quality sweets at pocket friendly prices.
