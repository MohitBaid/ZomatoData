I regret going to this cafe. The ambience was abominable. The sheesha served was really bad and so was the crowd. I went there for the first and last time. I left within 30 minutes. The cafe needs to improve itself. We ordered for a hookah and french fries and the bill came to 444 which was not at all worth it. I suggest u not to go to this cafe.

The cafe is just average .. small but the staff is pretty decent though .. they serve you well you have an option of playing your own playlist there .. they even have a jacuzzi where you can put your leg and enjoy shisha or food .. hookah was also simple nothing great .. crowd is cheap though And the place is a bit congested. Didn't try the food there.

Location:- Opposite The Great booze Story, its a small cafe having a decent Ambience, they even have a Jacuzzi option. The food and hookah is nice but they lack staffs due to which the service is pretty slow and the biggest problem is the crowd that is very cheap. We had ordered a Shahi Pan Rasna Mint hookah and a cheese Fondue both were nice and the prices are pretty cheap. The only thing they need to work on is their service and the crowd

One of the worst place to open in a posh locality of minto park. Ambience feels like a very cheap roadside low grade dhaba. Very loud music . Staff as expected by seeing the ambience very very rude . Service very poor . 45 mins to get the cheque. Apetite lost on entering the shit place so ended up ordering only water bottle and sheesha. 30-35 min wasted in trying to rectify the sheesha smoke by the impolite staff . Very bad buring smell from sheesha. Overall a worst place to ever visit .

My 1st visit which was also the last visit ,extra loud music despite repeated requests to lower the volume they did not do,chai wala's are more courteous than their staff,they will take a long time to get the cheque and also the change .

I visited this cafe today with my 7 friends with Little Vouchers. The ambiance is just perfect,music is loud, not too much lights and a good service by the staffs and manager. We ordered Cheese Fondue which was delicious and Baby Corn Crispy which was Â bit stiff. We took 3 Shishas(SHAHI PAN RASNA-good)(BRAIN FREEZER SPRING WATER-awesome)(Salsa-Ok Ok!). All the Shishas lasted for 1 hour without coal change.
But suddenly a cheap crowd of street boys came in cafe to have something and started commenting on the girls of our friend group. Since the Music is accessible by anyone in the cafe,they started playing some abusive songs and started whistling. Then I complained the same to the management(Manager-Shahid) of the cafe and they at the same time made them throw of their cafe. It was the manager Shahid who managed the things accordingly and made our visit a bit good.
I think entry of such crowd can hurt the image of the cafe as none of my friends will ever think to re-visit the cafe again.Â 
Thanks to Shahid Bro who dropped us in the cab with so much of courtesy.
