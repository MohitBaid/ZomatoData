Once used to be fantastic restaurant now an okeish place. Located under the Madhuban Cinema Hall, the only good thing left about this restaurant is it's"After giving food, we won't disturb you" thing. Overrated.

This is a very old restaurant which used to serve good food once. I had ordered a chicken roll from here which was very oily and not up to the mark.Â They should pay heed to the cleanliness of the restaurant and the quality of food.

A very average looking shabby type restaurant. It looks very unclean. The rolls are made on the outside part. I've tasted their egg roll. Was not interested in tasting anything! 
Very greasy and tasteless. 
Not recommended.

Pretty cheap rates, the rolls are pretty good. And that's all, it's all about the rolls. Other dishes aren't that good, nothing great available here. Service is pretty quick, and that's all I have to say.

It's the nearest restaurant to my house and I have been visiting it since 2005. Rolls are very good, chinese dishes are also awesome and needless to mention, it's very cheap.

Madhumita Restaurant is one of those restaurants in and around this place which can make great fried rice and chicken side dishes at minimal cost. I have been going to this place for long, maybe for the last 10 years and since the, my menu to order from this place has not changed. Quantity is great.

I remember coming to this place after our school got over.
Located just opposite to Ranikuthi more. It was basically a cinema hall named Madhuban, which got shut down.
A very shabby place. I gave it a 3.5 because I used to come down with my group and we used to satisfy our hungry souls.
I specially loved their chicken fried rice, which costed me only 70 bucks back then! The quantity was huge and was probably for 2 people. The fried rice had good amount of chicken and egg and had been my personal favourite.
