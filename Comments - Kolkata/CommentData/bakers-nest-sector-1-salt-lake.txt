This was my second visit to this homely and cozy cafe.
They have very courteous and helpful staff and the interiors are nice but I felt brighter lights could have been more refreshing as it looked a bit shabby.
During my first visit, we had prawn skewers and baked fish.
Prawn skewers were really tasty and juicy, the baked fish had decent amount of cheese and that was the showstopper!
My second visit:
We ordered chicken skewers, squid and tiramisu.
We asked about the dishes and they were generous enough to explain us.
The chicken skewers had 5 pieces of grilled chicken but it lacked the pineapple as mentioned in the menu. When we asked about it, they said they were lacking short of pineapples but after sometime they gave us a complementary pineapple and olive topping...this gesture really won our hearts!❤
The squid was good enough and worth trying. Tiramisu was tasty, creamy and the smell was really something different 😍

Been there on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered the chicken struganoff , baked chicken and a brownie with ice cream. The struganoff didn't taste so good. I think a more spicy preparation of the chicken over the bland rice base could have done justice. The French fries on top were done adequately though. The baked chicken was fantastic. This rating earns it's credit for that dish solely. Brownie with ice-cream was decent enough.

This place is an extremely satisfying place about all the emerging Cafe's. The food and ambience is impressive. It is pocket friendly as well with new kinds of breads which they make of their own. Do try the club sandwiches and pancakes.

If you're looking for a place where you could sit with your friends and catch up on the gossips that you have been missing out, Baker's Nest is the ideal place. The ambience is very soothing. The lighting and the music sets the mood just as you step into this small cafe. The food is good and cheap. Went there on two occasions and the experience was great. The service was good. A small cozy place with good music and no fancy decor makes this cafe a perfect place to spend some alone time too.

1st lunch of 2018 ! Had to be special. 🎉
Located very near to city centre. Actually, you have to find that shortcut. Otherwise it'll take a long time to find this cute little place.
With a very cute decor, the place has got its own style. For new year's day, it has been decorated with balloons, stars, ribbons and lots. The outside is decorated with foliages. Pretty much impressive. As we entered, we found a very homely atmosphere. Choose the inner section to dine in.
In background they played some of my favourite mixed tracks like soul sisters, titanium, shape of you and lots❤

So, we ordered Coriander Chicken Skewers as starter. In mains, we choose Ras el Hanout Chicken and Piri Piri Chicken. Yes it was a cluck cluck day😆

Coriander Chicken Skewers - such a blast ! I decided to take it for the coriander flavour. And that flavour made the chicken more delicious 😋. with cheese and bell paper salad topping, it was served with potato chips. The melted cheese topping won my heart.

Ras El Hanout Chicken - a bit crispy, juicy and delicious chicken breast, served with brown sauce. They give a complimentary rice with it. A spicy chutney with lettuce salad, side veggies were served with it. Very well cooked and well served. Excellent 👌

Piri Piri Chicken - at a glance both the dish look same. You'll feel the difference when you pour it into your mouth. It had also Side veggies, the same chutney with salad. The chicken breast is cooked with poppy seeds. Also served with a well quantity of rice like the other dish. Delicious it was.

We planned to have some refreshers before but we didn't have left a little space in our tummy.😂 the quantity was very much good. So we have to come here any other day for refreshers lol.😝 it's a newly opened cafe, but gonna be a favourite place for foodies in these few months. Keep it up you team ! 🔥💪🏻
Had a great new year lunch today.😁

The place is quite homely and peaceful, located in a quiet neighbourhood. The entrance was pretty welcoming. I ordered a cuppaccino and a mushroom and cheese pancake. To mention, the vegetarian options are too less on the menu. Cuppaccino was very average. Talking about the pancake, which was actually more like a crepe, it was topped, not stuffed, with white sauce and raw bell peppers. The taste was average but the description was different so I expected something else. Also the side of potato chips were stale. Not a very good experience to pull me back to this one.

A small 20 seater cafe located in the by lanes of saltlake sector 1, a 10minute walk from city centre 1.
Nothing great about the ambience or decoration,just some photo graphs here and there and dats all. The furnitures though are quiet sober.

The FOOD:--
We decided to play it safe and to go with the usual recommendations. So starter or drinks wasn't on our list and we directly went onto the main course.

PENNE PASTA IN MIXED SAUCE(chicken)-- This is surely a great dish. Right from the texture to the taste, its a must try. The sauce is very creamy and very flavourful. Pasta was very well cooked with ample chicken shreds and veggies. 2 breads to accompany that. And all this at just 140. Thats mindblowing.

PIRI PIRI CHICKEN-- This came as a platter. Chicken breast was well cooked and the piri piri sauce had the perfect blend of spices. The buttered rice though had no butter n was bland. The accompanying salads were way too much sweet and didnt complement the dish. Not recommended.

GRILLED FISH- Again a platter. Probably a fillet of a basa fish which was given with an orange sauce. The fish was very well cooked. Came with a mash which was superb.

BAKED FISH-- A bit like a lasagne. Again a fish fillet above a bed of pasta and a lot of cheese. Topped with a egg and cheese layer. The taste was heavenly. A perfect white sauce-cheese-pasta combo. A must try.

TURKEY ROULADE-- This ain't there on the menu and was a chistmas special. Prepared in the same way as a chicken roulade. The turkey meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Accompanied with a fish batter fry and rice. The fry was very crispy and fresh. Rice was again bland. All in all a great dish for turkey lovers.

BAKED ALASKA-- Now this was there in almost every previous reviews that i read and was highly recommended so went for it. The way in which the chef did the flambe with brandy in front of us,was very exciting but the taste didn't live upto the build up. A regular custard pudding topped with some ice cream,fruits and meringue (from egg white). The bitter taste of the brandy was destroying the entire desert. But still worth a try just for that prep part.

PRICING is very nominal and truly a budget cafe. No gst charged over the bill. You can easily have 3-4dishes at 600 for two.

SERVICE- needs huge improvement. We were a group of 6 and there were hardly any other customers in there still there was quite a delay in serving the orders.

Ideal place for students who are generally low on budget.

P.S. -- no cards accepted

So this place is a bit off the road... Hadn't it been for Google map, we wouldn't have found it... Being a small joint it could accommodate only a few people, somewhere around 18 to 20...
Coming to the food, we din't go for the starter, instead we went for the main course...
The dishes were:-
1. Chicken penne pasta with mixed sauce... Served with two slices of grilled bread.... The taste was normal as in any other pasta...
2. Baked chicken and baked fish.... Ooh how can I explain the taste... It was heavenly, loaded with cheese and chicken and complemented with a bun... Surely it was the best dish among all the dishes ordered...
3. Peri Peri chicken... Served with butter rice and salad... The taste was subtle but the chicken was a bit chewy...
4. Turkey roulade served with a fish fry butter rice and salad... This was their Christmas special item and being a first timer for turkey, the dish had won our hearts... They should put this up in their regular menu...
5. Grilled fish.... The dish was made in orange sauce and served with mashed potato... The fish was so soft that you wouldn't be able to differentiate it from the mashed potato... It will just melt in your mouth...
6. Baked Alaska... It was their speciality among the dessert... It was basically pudding with ice cream and served with alcohol which was lit up... Surely the presentation was mesmerising but the taste was not up to the mark...
7. Strawberry and chocolate muffins... Who would not love home made muffins and that too in Christmas... 
8. Chocolate Monte Carlo... Nice, smooth, tasty, all you want in a chocolate ice cream...
Pocket pinch was very low... The tax was included... If you are a bit down on your cash, do visit this place... But they don't accept cards..@
The only drawback was that the service was very lagging... If you are on a hurried schedule then you might wanna give a second thought...

I visited Baker's Nest only a couple of weeks ago with my friend. We were quite hungry so we ordered Grilled chicken, White sauce pasta & Fish fingers. The pasta was delicious & the fish finger nicely fried with a sauce. Out of the three dishes, the grilled chicken was not at par with the other two.
We liked the place with it's lighting and wooden decor at the ground floor of an old house, with music playing to lighten up our moods on a regular weekday.

Very close to City Centre 1, EC market to be precise. It's a small place, mostly with tables for two (but I'm sure they can accommodate large groups...). Nice and clean place. The staffs there are very friendly and well behaved. 
The food is pretty good, atleast I can vouch for the ones we had (Fried Chicken, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Chelo Kebab). Yep! You heard it right... The famous Chelo Kebab, but it's no where close to the original one (Peter Cat). Barring the comparison, it's really good! The pocket pinch is also manageable. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this place! A really good place to chill, talk, and hang out with delicious dishes to accompany you. The ambience is really nice for college goers and couples!

Located in salt lake sector 1 Baker's nest is a cafe which not only serves you coffee and Continental snacks but they also have some finger-licking dishes to try for.
I visited Baker's nest during pujos and had a warm welcoming experience which is exactly needed during that time.
The cafe has two sectors one outside and the other inside and it also provides reservation on special occasions. 
The decor is good with wall hangings and cute feedbacks on colourful notes just beside the entrance. The service was good and the staffs were very cooperating and welcoming.
For starters I ordered chicken stewers with orange mayo red cabbage and chips( a light starter to start your meal with). For shakes pineapple was ordered, but there are other flavors to try on. It had the exact chill to drive out the heat in that time and smooth and creamy.
 Then I had for main course two dishes - Peri Peri chicken which was roasted and slit in half from middle served with rice and veggies. The other one was grilled fish which was a well cooked creamy bhetki fish served with rice salads and veggies.
Coming to deserts, I had red velvet cake served with strawberry fruit crush topping and chocolate monte carlo which had ice cream sponge cake and whipped cream with Choco sauce as topping.
If anyone who is looking for a cafe to not only have coffee and snacks but also for some dishes, this is the exact one which you should be visiting. I had a beautiful experience making me feel like I am eating in my own home. And to get this homely feeling I would love to visit once again and have some delicacies.

This cafe is a new addition to the huge number of cafes in Salt Lake. Located near City Centre 1, the place is easy to find. 

The place is situated in the ground floor of a house. It is nicrly decorated with dim light and small wooden chairs and tables. It looked pretty decent. One thing deserves special mention - the songs they play are all from our favourites list ; each and every song made the ambience more romantic and stole our hearts.

Coming to the food,we ordered the following -

|| Drinks ||

√ Cold Coffee : The coffee was yummy.

√ Seasonal Mocktail : It had mango and green chilli. This tasted really . Recommended.

|| Starters ||

√ Chicken Fingers : They offer 6 chicken fingers with generous amount of tartar sauce and potato chips. It tasted really delicious.

|| Main Course ||

√ Grilled Chicken : This was one of the best dishes we had that day.Served with wine sauce , the chicken was perfectly cooked and was overwhelming. They also offer good amount of veggies and french fries. Recommended !

√ Baked Chicken : This dish offers chicken with generous amount of cheese. It tasted good enough but we were expecting a bit more chicken and less pasta.

√ Piri Piri Chicken : This was also a good dish. Well cooked chicken along with rice and veggies. 

|| Desserts || 
 
I must say that the desserts of this place are amazing. The cupcakes are presented in the best possible way. The mousses are also amazing.

√ Baked Alaska : This was the best dessert of the day in terms of presentation. They burn the marshmellow in front of you,which is a scene to remember. It tasted good too. Recommended !

√ Chocolate Mousse : The mousse was the best dessert of the day in terms of taste. It was heavenly . Highly recommended !!

√ Strawberry Cupcake : The cupcakes was presented perfectly.It was delicious to both the eyes as well as the stomach.

The service was commendable. Food wise , this place deserves a 4. But I gave that extra 0.5 for amazing choice of songs and great hospitality.

Overall,we had a pleasant experience. ♥♥

A very homely place, formed on the ground floor of a house, Baker's nest is a good place to catch up with your friend over great food, but not minding the interiors of the restaurant. It is like eating at a friend's place, comfortable and welcoming!

The food is good, starting with fish fingers, to grilled fish and chicken steak. The steak could have been cooked more though. My favourite part was the dessert- baked Alaska, which is a dessert on fire! The owners lovingly light it up, and it tastes even better.

Location - A 10 minutes walk from city centre 1 will take you to this place.

Ambiance - Well the place had proper ambiance and the staffs were courteous too.

Food - The food items that I ordered were :
•Chicken and cheese pan cakes.
•Chicken steak which was served with French fries and garlic bun.

Chicken and cheese pan cakes tasted good but I do feel that the preparation of chicken steak needs improvement as I felt a lack of taste.
Finally I must say that this place is really cool to hangout with you're friends and family and is also budget friendly. I would like to visit this place again.

Located near EC market and City Centre 1, this is a homely cosy cafe serving continental dishes and gets brownie points for the extremely reasonable price and for not charging gst! We ordered 2 dishes which we had never had before anywhere:
1. Chicken stroganoff- both the rice and the chicken tasted bland but I'm not judging because I had for the first time ever and maybe it is meant to taste like that. However the taste of the sautee veggies and french fries won my heart!
2. Baked alaska: a creamy dessert with cake,ice cream and frozen fruits within served with a little alcohol poured on top,set on fire. The alcohol imparts a bitter taste but otherwise this is a sweet tasty treat. The cake was a little too hard and frozen, the fruits and cream tasted good.
Overall, the items did not quite agree with my taste buds!

But the sandwich had left me quite heartbroken after having the stroganoff which amplified our expectations,we had ordered sandwiches which is to be honest was no match against the Hungry Tide sandwiches.

All the foods were sufficient in quantity and the prices were quite reasonable !our pocket pinch was just 530.The stuff were very warm and welcoming !Would love love to visit again and try out the rest from their menu !Highly recommended!

Nice chill out place. Very simple interior but liked spending time. Very friendly staff. We ordered some squid which came along with some garlic bread and we loved that. The coffee was also pretty nice. Over all good experience and value for money !

Quantity per serving is pretty less.
The food was pretty tasty though. 
But the sandwich had left me quite heartbroken after having the stroganoff which amplified our expectations,we had ordered sandwiches which is to be honest was no match against the Hungry Tide sandwiches.

I was out with two of my friends and was in search of a cozy cafe to hangout. Zomato came to our rescue and we got to know about this cafe.

 Located near City Centre1. 10 mins walk away cafe from cc1.

Baker's nest is a small joint which can accomodate around 20-25 people at a time. Everything in this cafe is pretty from the wooden furnitures to the lightings everything. 

Coming to the food, we opt for a Chicken Steak, Penne Pasta with mixed sauce and a Virgin Mojito. The Pasta was tasty it came in a good quantity. The Steak came with mashed potato, boliled vegetables,baby corn and French fries. It tasted so-so. The Steak was not so impressive. And the drink tasted fine.

All in all this place is a value for money. The staff's were really helpful and the service was promt too. But I just feel they have to improve their food quality. Food here is very normal like basic. So that's needs to improve!

Awesome food! Excellent place to sit and chat with friends and enjoy the cuisines of Europe in an absolutely different way....every food has a wonderful flavour!
Had their Fusion Mocktail and Grilled Fish. The Mocktail simply stole the show!!! It tasted of an ecstatic orange flavour with marange on top of it! The Mocktail showed off three different colourful layers and the marange was the most unique idea!!
 The grilled fish tasted with a perfect blend of Calcutta Bhetki and a homemade orange sauce. The dish really tasted too good! I had never had such a beautiful preparation of grilled fish before...
All in all it was a very good experience at their place. Even the politeness of the staff and the cleanliness and hygiene that they maintain is really commendable! From the moment we entered till the time we left, we felt that we were home...
Moreover, they don't charge any extra taxes! So that's an added advantage.
Would love to visit this place very soon!! Highly recommended!!

Had visited the place on the reviews I had heard.

It looks very classy but lacks the quality in the spread that they put up in the menu.
There is a lot of fancy on the card which actually doesn't come out on the plate.
For a Bacon sandwich there is served with sweet sauces and stroganoff​ is more Bengali than it can get.

Spent a good buck on not so good food !

The place is a small opening in the interior of Sector 1. It doesn't have many vegetarian items so we ordered for Grateen. It was nice. Not very great. The virgin mojito was also very sweet and not tasty. There isn't any soft music nor many seats at the outdoors. Overall it isn't an extraordinary place to visit.

Was lazily rolling on my bed on Sunday late eve when I thought of ordering from here. The steak was difficult to tackle. 

Accompanied by French Fries I thought the platter was moderate.

Baker's Nest is a newly opened cafe which offers dishes at affordable prices. The decor is pretty and homely.
Coming to the taste of the food, it is not upto the mark. The coffee was okayish. The baked chicken and chicken omlette were the not upto my expectations, and the garlic bread lacked the required taste.

However, the chocolate chip and strawberry muffins were really good!

This cute little café is almost near cc1, in a very quiet lane.
To tell the truth, the place looks average inside, with less than 10 tables or so. I went there with one of my veggie friend, so had to eat veg, which I feel is not that good out here. I should try the non veg items on the menu to have a good idea of this place.

Now coming to the food, we had ordered cottage cheese skewers which was really soft but not that great, it was served with orange mayo, which was not at all going with that, it also had a portion of local potato chips which smelled weird, the manager said they will take care of it. Good. We also had french fries which was average and had cappuccinos, well that was great, and that is the reason I'm giving .5 extra.

Definitely going to come here to try non veg which I heard is good.

They were not accepting cards, only cash or paytm. I don't know they will accept in future or not. Do confirm if you are cashless like me.

It is a place which can be made more pretty, so need to work on that.

Food - 5/10 (Will try non veg to change my views)
Staff- 9/10
Ambiance- 7/10
Pocket pinch- Incredibly low. (We had all of these in 340 bucks.)
Will visit again ❤

The day we went might just have been an off day for them, but the food was disastrous! Every item lacked salt and taste! :/
The muffin was a consolation though, the only good thing. The pancake was too bad. Overall, it wasn't a good experience in terms of food.

In Salt Lake area, this newly opened cafe is actually a hidden gem. It is very near to City Centre 1.

Very soothing ambience.
Simple decor but attractive also.

We ordered
1. Chicken Fingers : It was simple and tasty.

2. Bacon Club Sandwich : It was so tasty, full of cheese and the quantity of other things in it was good.

3. Ham Pasta : It was damn tasty and too creamy. The waiter suggested us to have the mixed sauce variant and to be honest, this was the best pasta I ever had. 😋

4. Baked Alaska : This was the best part of the lunch. This dessert made my day. It tastes as classic as it looks. 

Fast service.

Courteous staffs.

Very much pocket friendly (with Null Tax).

I must say , it is a good place to hang out.
Would love to come here again!

Overall I would have rated this cafe a 4.0, but that extra 0.5 is for the oh-so-hospitable and prompt service of the staff. I was out from a movie in CC1, and had sometime at hand. I was hungry so Coming to Zomato search was the only option, thats how I found out this place. The Bakers Nest the name totally complements the kind of place it is. Its a cozy corner located near EC Block Market in Sector 1, Salt Lake, Kolkata. The ambience is lovely here. Wooden furnitures, the lights, the plant-hangings, room-like compartments, everything gave the cafe a vintage look and feel. 
Being a new cafe, it has a varied menu. I had ordered a Cappuccino for me to start with. The coffee was quite well made and everything was in proportion, thereby tasting quite good and creamy. Next, I had ordered fried bacon for me, which was not on the menu, however they prepared it for me. It was perfectly made too. For main course, I had ordered Grilled Chicken, which came in a quite generous quantity, along with smashed potato, boiled veggies and french fries. The chicken could have been softer, however it tasted quite good overall. 
The reception of this place has a glass case, and they keep cute cupcakes. The best part is when you order cupcakes, they bake it freshly for you. I had ordered a Dark Chocolate and a Strawberry Creme cupcake for me. Loved them too.
I am definitely coming back to this place, as I keep coming to Salt Lake every now and then.
This place is perfect if you want to spend some time alone with yourself, or go for a perfect evening with your friend. Loved this nest for sure.

A very simple yet very well maintained place. Food quality is simply awesome. We ordered cold coffee with ice cream chicken pene pasta in white sauce, chicken fingers. It was a delight. The only disadvantage is the location of the place. It took us almost 20 minutes to find the place. Keeping aside, thumbs up to the service, ambience, food quality and the hospitality. We'd love to come back. Way to go guys!

Went there on a Friday night. We ordered coffee, cream of tomato soup, fried chicken and fish meuniere. Coffee was plain old Nescafe. The soup was good but it was little too sweet (tasted ketchupy). The fried chicken was average, it was served along with boiled veggies and fries. The fish meuniere tasted horrible. It was Bhetki with a layer of cheese sauce on it. It was bland and had a strong fishy smell. We could taste the Maida in the sauce. We asked them to replace the fish but they refused to do so. It had to be thrown away.
P.S not recommended. There are cafes with better food around. Also, the waiters are unaware of all the items in the menu and the service was really clumsy.

A friend of mine was suggesting me this place for quite sometime and finally I decided to come here with him one evening after a movie. I was quite overwhelmed by the homely atmosphere that welcomed us as soon as we stepped inside the cafe and with the extremely well behaved staff it felt like we were sitting in our own living room. 
We ordered the Coriander Chicken Skewers, Chicken Steak and Baked Bhetki according to the chef's recommendations. 
The chicken skewers were a little underseasoned but, had a decent flavour of coriander. The chicken steak was very flavourful. I personally did not like the sauce much but the rest including the bread and veggies seemed perfect. 
Finally, the deal of the day was the Baked Bhetki. The fish was well seasoned, nicely baked and tasted heavenly with the risotto that came along. There was a burst of flavors inside the mouth. 
The best part : all of it came for just Rs. 630. 
So, it was a win win situation. 
I would definitely recommend Baker's Nest to everyone and would also go back there myself.

This place is a hidden treasure in Saltlake. Beauty of this cafe lies in its simple yet snazzy decor. We went with cold coffee, baked chicken, grilled chicken and chicken steak. All of the items were mouth-watering except the steak. This place can boast of a speedy service and courteous staff. The best part is, the price for each item quoted in the menu includes all the taxes. Also, all the items are decently priced. Definitely worth multiple visits.

Placed in the semi-interiors of Salt Lake Sector-1 ,Baker's Nest is an amazing place. Management happened to be really good and the food was even better. We ordered 1 Chicken Stroganoff, 1 baked chicken, 1 virgin mojito and one brownie with hot chocolate (not in the menu but served when asked) and were absolutely impressed.

A newly opened cafe at salt lake area. The place is beautiful,specially the outside area. The decor is simple yet it will attract you. My friend recommended this place. We ordered baked chicken,chicken pasta and baked Alaska. I loved the chicken pasta. The baked chicken was heavenly as well. Baked Alaska was a new dish which I haven't tasted earlier. It had a good taste. But the pasta stole my heart! Satisfied with this place. The quantity is worth the price. Will visit soon.

Tucked in a cosy bylane,this place looks like it's straight out of a fairytale. 😌 Sans the decor,this place turned out to be a disappointment. 
We ordered potato wedges, chicken cheese pancake, and Chicken Stroganoff. Every one of them tasted bland. The sweet lime soda, and the baked Alaska failed to appeal too, not to mention that some of their staff seemed utterly unaware of the details of the menu. 
Not going back!

What was so wrong that I rated it only 3/5 ???

We visited the cafe during Durga Puja. Since we had no prior booking, we had to wait. All the waiting would have been compensated if the food had been up to the standard. but, sadly for us, it was below standard. 

I have heard a lot about this amazing cafe, and also it holds a really good ranking in the cafe lists, but perhaps it was our bad luck, that we didn't get to enjoy that charm, that prime.

The staff was great, can't deny that, and even we met the owner, and she was really hospitable. The decor is cozy, but a bit congested. 

The food that we ordered were -

Chicken Fingers: Those six pieces with the tartar sauce was the best dish that we had there. 

Chicken Stroganoff: The presentation was unique. As I have never seen Stroganoff being presented in a bowl with the vegetable sticking out from the side. Unfortunately, the dish was really sour. When we asked for assistance, the owner herself came up and explained that it was due to the usage of some "brown sauce". 

Baked Chicken: This was another good dish that we had. Hot cheesy pasta, with chicken slices and mushroom, it was pretty delightful. It was served with a complimentary bun.

Chicken Penne Pasta: Another flop dish. We ordered a mixed sauce pasta, and the sauce was again too tangy. 

Baked Alaska: This is one of their recommended dishes, and it was quite okay.

After all these dishes and the disappointment we suffered, the only good thing was, they didn't apply GST. So, we only paid for the dishes and no extra charges.

I intend on visiting this place again, to see what exactly went wrong the previous time.

Location: roughly 3 min walk from EC Market. Can be located on the google map.

Ambiance: It's a quaint cafe that is the converted form of ground floor of a house. It's simple and yet pleasant. There are handcrafted wooden chairs and tablets and also a pastry shelf cum counter. There's a soothing music in the background which makes it somewhat more 'comfy'.

Staff: Very polite, well versed and courteous staff. They'll greet with a smile and comply tO almost anything to let you be at ease. The owners too are way too sweet.

Food: the highlight. We munched down quite a lot of items and literally loved them all. We had ordered:

●Fresh lime soda: very refreshing
●Prawn pasta: the waiter asked us to go for the mixed sauce variant and honestly it's one of the best pastas I've ever had.
●Chicken fingers: these come with a side of mayo dip and wafers. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, just how it should be.
●Chicken mayo sandwich: it's a panini sandwich that has generous amount of filling and also very light and balanced taste.
●Peri Peri Chicken: this is a part of their pujo special menu. It has rice, french fries and coleslaw. Spicy, smoky and tender chicken breast. A great pick.
●Grilled chicken: it comes with wine sauce. Tangy and mildly spiced sauce that goes well with the peppery grill.
●Chicken Steak: it comes with a side of french fries , boiled vegetables and a bun. Given the price, this is the best buy you can get. Although the chicken here was a tad bit hard and seemed a bit overcooked.
●Baked Alaska: A premium dessert. Tastes as good as it looks.

Pocket pinch: So much for just ₹1780. This is what happy meal feels like.

Edit:

Third visit.

Tried their cheese chicken pancakes, chicken stroganoff, baked fish.

The pancakes were basically light crepes filled with chicken and gooey cheese. What a delight!

Stroganoff was a regular amidst the rest.

Baked fish was definitely star of the night. It comes on a bed of penne Alfredo topped with the fish fillet and generously baked with egg and cheese blend. Flavours much?

Happy feasting again!

This pretty lil cafe is in the secret corners of saltlake!  This cafe was in my bookmarked places for so long and today I finally visited for a quick lunch,and experience was quite great! 
Ordered chicken penne pasta in white sauce which tasted great, chicken salami grilled sandwich tasted pretty average though! 
Later we took one cappuccino and a cold coffee, and ended the meal with lil cupcakes! 
Now these Cupcakes need special mention, tasted so amazing and priced at the minimal cost! 
Staffs were courteous and service was quick! Looking forward to visit again for their signature continental dishes! 
This place is highly recommended! :)

I was really hopeful seeing the review,But then the reality was something different.
I don't know if I'm the only person who was shocked to taste cinnamon in cappuccino.
They even mixed the cinnamon powder in fried fish too.
 I don't know if they have a factory of cinnamon or what.

Only good thing i found there, the moment i asked them to change the coffee they did but they said "cappuccino is always served with cinnamon in it"
I was like okay..i probably came from mars and never tasted what cappuccino is..
Despite changing the coffee it didn't taste good. The coffee was like water.
I literally came home and vomited 5 times.
This was my experience people!!
Yours might just be something different.

Thanks for taking out time and give a read.

Have been to this cafe twice so I am reviewing on the basis of the overall experience,and the verdict is "Passed with flying colours".Although this cafe is a bit hard to locate but the effort is worthy.The coffee is proper and the food is tasty yet cheap.Compared to the other cafes of Salt Lake this cafe has a lot more to offer and yet it doesn't burn through your pocket.We have been to this place both during peak hours and when the place was empty but surprisingly there was no difference in the behaviour of the staff.They were friendly and effective.Now coming to the food,we ordered Grilled Chicken and Chicken Fingers.Grilled Chicken could've been better whereas the Chicken Fingers were lip smacking.Finally found a Chicken Finger with "chicken" in it.The cupcakes are equally worthy of mention especially the Mango flavoured cupcake.The bill in the end will definitely not end your smile as the prices are pocket friendly.Hope they get better with the passage of time.

Comparatively a new cafe in Saltlake.

Location: EC block, close to Saltlake city centre. Parking is not at all a problem as you can park your car anywhere in Saltlake.

Cafe and food: It's a small and cute cafe with limited sitting capacity, situated on the ground floor of a house. Decoration is simple with limited crowd. The menu is not much elaborated but trendy. We had long leaf Darjeeling tea and fried chicken with boiled vegetables and some French fries. Personally as a tea lover, I would love to taste a little better Darjeeling tea while I am paying 100 bucks for it. The fried chicken was good enough but I would prefer some more quantity of dip with it.

Service: The service is nice and quick but it would be better if the management will give special attention to the floor which needs to be clean time to time.

Pocket pinch: The best part is the price includes all taxes, which makes this cafe quite pocket friendly. We paid Rs 360 for 2 cups of darjeeling tea and fried chicken.
A major problem : They don't accept card !!! 

Overall a good place to hang out with friends or family !

There are so many Cafe options now coming up in Saltlake and this has to be one of the best.
I went to this place with my wife and mother.

We ordered the following:
√ Cream of chicken soup- I had the best cream of chicken soup here. The soup was thick and it had ample boiled pieces of chicken.

√ Fried chicken- This was really good. It had 4 good pieces of chicken. It tasted like butter fry. It was served with french fries,veggies and tartar sauce.

√ Grilled fish- This was awesome. One good,freshly grilled bhetki served on top of mashed potato and orange juice. Orange juice will definitely give you a contrasting taste to your tongue.

√ Fish fingers- This had 6 pcs of succulent,deep fried fingers served with potato chips and tartar sauce.

√ Baked alaska- We took this in dessert. This had 1 piece of fruit cake with fruits and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The whole thing was covered with whipped cream and brandy as base. It was lit up infront of us and then served to us. This whole thing tasted awesome. Do try out this when you visit Bakers nest.

Ambience was nice and the service was really prompt and courteous.
Overall a nice place to try out good food and definitely a POCKET FRIENDLY one.

Located amidst the heart of Saltlake between FD Block and City centre ,this small cosy cafe is run by a mother -son duo and is tagged along the reasonable eateries of Saltlake,Kolkata. If you cant find the place , you can totally depend on your google maps . The interior is pretty well decorated and quite neat. 

What I Ordered - 

1. STRAWBERRY MUFFINS : If you are at Bakers Nest , you must try out their range of muffins .The muffin tasted quite homely and freshly baked. 

2. CHOCO-CHIP MUFFINS : Another classic muffin from the range of their muffim sections. The chocochips added a crispy touch to the muffins. Do try out . 

3.CHICKEN PASTA : I wont say ,this was one of the best pastas I ever had , but it was very okayish . Nothing fancy . Also they had given bread alongside this dish . The bread added a different taste when blended with the pasta. 

4.GRILLED CHICKEN : If you are looking for wholesome healthy chicken ,then this item is for you. The chicken tasted very good and the grilling was done to its perfection. A must try .

5.BAKED CHICKEN : Also another classic dish from the bakers nest.  Also one suggestion do look out for their chicken items ,as I felt they were very good. 

6.CHICKEN SALAMI CHEESE SANDWICH : A quick bite of this will kill your hunger. The salami ,cheese was quite good . Overall an okay dish . 

Pricing Wise the cafe is a top notch , but service is very slow. I understand it is run by a mother -son duo ,but my order came after a long time .I would tell the shop owners to speed up their service and hire more efficient staffs. Also do visit for their amazing food.

After browsing about this cafe today morning, we decided to visit there. 
Latte = Instant latte mix was served , please don't make coffee like this. Very dishonest. You are running a Cafe, Don't use ready to drink or eat products. 
Masala Chai=It was okay. 
Chicken Fingers= Okay type. 
Fresh Lime Soda= Very Refreshing and good. 
Banana Mixed Fruit Pancake= Good one. 
No card's accepted here. 
I heard that it's only 3 months old, maybe they will improve their service soon.

A small cafe with pretty good food. I went there with my girlfriends for Saptami lunch and we had a good time. Started with chicken skewers which was juicy and tasty as well. But I ordered fruit cocktail which I forgot to mention to prepare without mint and that ruined my mood for sometimes. But the main courses saved the day. We had Chef's special grilled bhetki, fish steak and baked bhekti. Three dishes were unique in flavours and had classic continental taste. Service was lousy as they need to hire professionals. The effort is very good just need a bit more preparations.

Adding to the long list of affordable eateries in Salt Lake, Baker's Nest is a quaint cafe owned and run by a graceful mother-son pair. Located between City Centre and FD Block ground, one might find it a little difficult to find without GPS.

Commencing with the décor; the cafe adheres to the modern norms of a Kolkata styled cafe donning dainty seating arrangement with an additional outdoor seating available for blissful evenings. A small bakery counter is placed beside the cash counter with delightful cakes and desserts on display.

We have been to this place twice, so would conjure up all the dishes we have had here. Our visit boasted of a succulent Grilled Chicken presented admirably. The dish sums up a neat continental mains cooked and presented neatly. Next up was the Chicken Steak; this one was disappointing. The steak was chewy and tasted average as well. The Grilled Fish was the winner by a significant margin. Extremely well cooked and topped with wine sauce makes it a humdinger.

Our second visit to this place was on Saptami Night, and to our surprise they kept the menu almost intact and added the Pujo special to it. The Chello Kebab was intriguing as they deviated from the conventional one. In place of mutton kebab, the introduction of fish fry bode well for us. The Chicken Kebab was a deal breaker. Too dry and wasn't up to the mark. However, the Prawn Skewers won over our hearts. Topped with fresh herbs, the prawns tasted sumptuous.

Efficient pricing makes Baker's Nest a luring concept, and the courteousness of the owner as well as the staff paired with some excellent dishes will make your day.

Its a new place, near cc1. I went on a Saturday early evening and fortunately it wasn't very crowded. I ordered grilled chicken, cream of chicken soup, potato wedges, and coffee.this was part of a deal on little app.
Staff was very polite and friendly.food was disappointing. Grilled chicken was cold when it was served and it was processed in the kitchen after I complained.but this time also it was not hot. Staff offered to replace the item and we were served with the replacement within 10 minutes, but unfortunately even this time the food wasn't as hot as a freshly grilled chicken should be.chicken was not as tender as it should have been.
Cream of chicken soup was not good at all, it was cold, not hot like a soup. It had too much fresh cream added in the end.i wasn't able to have the soup.
Fruit salad was essentially some cut fruits in ice cream and fresh cream base which was okay.
The best item was definitely potato wedges, it was served hot, with right amount of herbs and right crispness.
I also ordered some cute looking cup cakes which were also good.
Coffee served was too strong, so couldn't have the full cup :(
Overall I am disappointed as this restaurant has such good reviews and I had gone with high hopes :(
The positive thing is that the person at the counter did take our feedback with a smile and I hope to be back there to have delicious food.

What more do I need to say when my friends have said it all. This place has the potential to feature in the 'hidden gems' category in Zomato. I have had continental food in almost all the restaurants in Kolkata, this place will certainly be amongst the top three in that list. Starting from the chicken fries, to the pasta to Baked Alaska, each and everything was perfection. We Bangalis are known for our hospitality and it is an old adage that even if you serve us leftover rice(পান্তাভাত ) with a smiling face, that would satisfy our soul. The elegant lady owner had made sure that they score 100/100 on that front. I'm deducting half star for the untrained staff and relatively smaller sitting arrangement, you might have to wait for sometime before you get a place. But the food fairly compensates for this lacuna. I'm going to visit this place whenever I'm near Saltlake. Thank you for the experience.

Food - Delicious & sufficient.    Ambiance - Calm & Cozy.    Hospitality - Friendly.     Service - Prompt.    I don't think one needs anything more to enjoy a casual lunch, supper or dinner. And yes BAKER'S NEST has all these ingredients to make it a perfect Dining Hot Spot !!!
                    AWESOME EXPERIENCE..

If I write one negative word about the quality and taste of their food, I would be putting the judgement of my taste buds under serious threat. It's absolutely fantastic. From the mocktail as refreshing drink to baked Alaska as dessert, they serve outstanding quality of continental food. Although I felt the servicing and the decor could have been a little better, the lady owner and other staffs certainly make up for these with their cordial behaviour. And the most astonishing fact about them is the pricing, considering the pricing of other restaurants in Kolkata right now, they are ridiculously cheap. And what can be better for a foodie when u do not have to shoulder the burden of taxes? Overall, fantastic experience..

Although a very new addition to the Kolkata's restaurant list but it's already making its mark. Around 20 seats are available and we had to wait outside for 15 minutes before we were summoned. But the foods were worth waiting. We started with ordering mojito and two types of starters. The drink was refreshing if not something out of the world experience. Both the starters were crispy and delicious and the presentation could have been better. In the main course we ordered ham pasta with
white sauce and it was just muaaah. The quality and quantity both were Great. If you are there you must try the baked Alaska, it is something different and is good for your tastebuds. Moreover the prices of all the items are very reasonable and icing on the cake these prices are inclusive of taxes!!!!
On the downside, the staffs are a little untrained and lacks professionalism. But since the place is new they will definitely improve in future. After the lunch we got to meet the chef too.

A lovely little eatery with extremely pleasant and courteous staff. Moderately wide variety of food and beverages. Every item that we had ordered were freshly cooked and brought to the table. Thus, the waiting time might be a little more. Of the dishes that we ordered, the non-veg variants were better that the veg. Also, the starters are better than the main course. Overall, it was a happy and satisfactory experience.

Went here for lunch with a friend of mine who said this place has been serving some nice food in salt lake. 
Its is a nice little cafe in a corner of ec block.
Service was a tad bit slow and the waiters couldn't be seen for a while but the food was good with a few let downs.
Fried Chicken - thin pieces of chicken fried in crispy batter, served with fries, boiled veggies and a home made mayo. The chicken was soft and crispy and very delicious. 
Chicken cheese balls - I didn't like it much there was just a hit of cheese and not a lot of cheese and the amount of salt was also too much.
Chicken pasta - White sauce pasta with loads of chicken and two pieces of toast. The pasta was as tasty as it could be. 
Chicken steak - the chicken was a bit chewy but other than that the sauce was good.
Baked chicken - it almost tasted like chicken pasta, the difference is it was served in a bowl baked with a thick layer of cheese on top. 
Veg au gratin - my friend ordered it. I couldn't understand the point of having veggies baked in white sauce and cheese is is served like the baked chicken with a piece of bun. 
Cappuccino - a basic homemade version of coffee nothing special.
Strawberry milk shake - it was a part of their special menu but it was just very average nothing very special. 
We ordered so much of main course that we didn't have any room for desserts left, so we left the desserts for the next time.
The food was good but they can improve a lot on their service.

Expected a lot. But it seems a nice restaurant with only 'good' food! We ordered fried fish and chicken steak with two coffee. First of all they delivered the fist dish quite late.  Steak was good but one of two fried fish was not fresh. This collapses the reputation of it. That's all. Ambience was serene.

VERY GOOD :)
Went to this place a few days back. It is a very good budget friendly place. The prices are quite reasonable and the food is great. So coming to the food we ordered- 
1. Baked chicken- the dish was loaded with cheese and very tasty. I personally thought it lacked a bit of salt. The bread served with it was home baked. It was fresh and very delicious. Overall a very good and filling dish.
2. Fish fingers- a very good dish. The fish was good fried perfectly, and the tartar sauce was good. 
3. Baked Alaska - the highlight of this dish was the presentation. The owner lady switched off the lights and blow torched the dessert right in front of us. It looked beautiful. The dessert tasted good as well. 

I was a bit sad because I was looking forward to tasting the chicken pancake, but it was not available. 

The service was prompt and polite. The lady owner was very friendly and made us feel at home :)
The ambiance was great and a very positive experience overall.

Want a pocket friendly paisa wasul restaurant with good ambiance in Salt Lake area???it's bekar nest.
After a huge search (want pocket friendly but mouth watering food) in zomato... I decided to go bekar's nest! After wacthing a movie in city center 1... We toke a auto to EC market(bit confused about the distance) bt it's take only 2 mint in auto and 7 minute by foot.. The restaurant is just beside the EC market...
Bekar's nest is a little restaurant with great DHAMAKA... 😍😍😍
THE FOOD... THE AMBIANCE... THE SERVICE....THE BUDGET... EVERYTHING
1st talk abt their ambiance... It's nothing special (little decoration with decent way) bt this simple decor can won ur heart...
Now food.... We had baked chiken, chiken steak, baked alashka, virgin mojito...
Chiken steak was mouth watering, served with a bun(4.5/5)
Virgin mojito disappointed us... There was a strong mint flavour which make the mojito quite bitter (2/5)
Baked chicken... 😍😍😍😍don't know why they named this dish 'baked chicken'!!! It's a dish made with chesse, egg, pasta, chicken... And you can't imagine how yummy it was! If you are in city center 1 nd you have enough time (nd only 200 rupee in your pocket) don't think twice go for this dish... Trust me it never disappoint u...if you are a person with less interest in food, you will die for the dish.
Baked alashka was a desert severd by firing caramel... First you love with the presentation Now second time with the taste..... Awesome taste (not very sweet), it melt automatic in your mouth.. (5/5)
Everything was to the point... Serving was also okk...
Now guess about d pocket pinch!!!It's only 600 rupess!!No extra charge.. Which restaurant serves you two main course, one drink and one dessert within 600 in city center area???
Recommend👍👍👍

It is always very relaxing to dine in at a cozy place.Baker's Nest is newly open.This place located on EC263,EC Block,Sector 1,Saltlake City,Kolkata.The ambience is comfortable and homely.Decoration is pretty good.They brought out some amazing dishes based on their innovation.They also have open sitting area which is wonderful.

I visited there with my fellow foodiesfor dinner and was very much pleased with the food.

The dishes are-

Virgin Mojito-Mojito is a traditional Cuban highball. Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar, lime juice, soda water, and mint.This is a true savior of this weather.
Cold Coffee-We all love cold coffee.The presentation is good.The texture was perfect and this tasted nice.
Darjeeling Exotic Tea-This drink was very very refreshing.The sweetness was perfect and tasted amazing.
Breads(Masala and Cheese Garlic)-The garlic bread had a different flavour both are Masala and Cheese.It was perfectly baked with lots of cheese.
Chicken Steak-Though a common dish,still these were really nice in taste and composition.The steak served with burger,fried potatoes.The base was soft and fresh.
Chicken Stroganoff-Stroganoff is a Russian dish.Chicken stroganoff contents earthy mushrooms and savory sauce over egg noodles.A ultimate food to enjoy.
Grilled Fish-In this dish Vetki filet was grilled and served along with french fries.Food was present in wholesome amount and delicious in tast.
Chicken and Cheese Pancake-Crispy pancake are filled with a creamy chicken and mushroom.Shredded chicken was cooked in strong spices.The dish was very appealing and great in tast.
Pancake with honey and peanuts-A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.With honey and peanuts this pancake tastes amazing.This dish is one of my favorite.
Small Cup Cakes-Cup cake is always favorite of mine.This was gluten free and very light with good taste.
After tasting all these dishes now it's time for dessert-

Baked Alaska-Baked Alaska is a dessert food consisting of ice-creme and cake topped with browned meringue.The dish is made of ice-creme placed in a pie dish lined with slices of pudding and topped with meringue.This taste awesome and the signature dish of Baker's Nest.
Overall the experience has been really wonderful and memorable.If someone love baking food they must visit this place.The hospitality was so good as well.The owner herself being very attentive and nice.Staffs were so prompt in service.

This place is perfect for a party,get together or even your loved once.Many many thanks to Rajdeep Bhattacharjee  and the Owner for inviting us.Love my team Panchphoron.

Located at EC block in salt lake this cafe is something which I have been looking upon to visit for a long time back. This small cafe had very warm welcoming atmosphere with pleasant ambience decorated with flower hangings at the entrance and inside with beautiful gourmet wall hangings and also this  cafe is gst free and it's also best to arrange parties and reservations . Now coming to the food for starters I ordered chicken stewers with orange mayo red cabbage and potatoe chips. It was a very light starters. A pineapple shake was ordered which was very creamy and icy.
For main course I had Peri Peri chicken- roasted masala slit chicken with rice and salad with veggies.Another main course was served which was grilled fish and the fish was creamy curry bhetki with rice and salads and veggies.For desserts red velvet muffin was served with strawberry fruit crush as a topping for sweet tooth and the cake was just so soft and spongy.And I also had chocolate monte Carlo which was a delicacy having chocolate sauce as a topping above whipped cream below ice cream and sponge cake and cream. I just loved this sweet tooth.. must visit :)

First look at this place, beautiful ambience with comfy seatings. The staff are courteous.
It's looks like a small cafe situated a bit off the main public transport road.
We took grilled prawn skewers, iced tea and rosogolla mousse. The prawn were not that great, a big turnoff. The iced tea was okay. The rosogolla mousse saved the day. It had the rosogolla flavour along with the rose flavours. Yum!
Coming to price, it's moderate. Won't burn a hole in the pocket.
I might want to drop in again to try out their other dishes. Will recommend the place.

After some Pandal hopping and since little drizzle started decided to try out this restaurant . Located at EC Block Salt Lake . Moderate ambience , classy decor . We ordered Blue Lagoon , Bacon Sandwich , Pan seared Bhetki and Sizzling Bhetki which was apparently Chefs special . The Blue Lagoon was refreshing , too sweet for me . TheBacon Sandwich had only one thin strip of Bacon which was indeed disappointing . Pan seared Bhetki was dry and the vegetable wasn't really going with it . Sizzling Bhetki was somewhat good compared to others .. They don't take GST , so plus points there ..

Baker Nest - the name itself drew my attention when I saw it in zomato. And then the reviews looked quite promising. So, yes was in wishlist and we were there on Durga Puja mahasosthi evening.

Location:
____________

It was in EC block, just 1 min walking distance from EC market. To be more precise it is 15 mins walking distance from city centre 1. Building no. Is EC 273. It was on the ground floor. Just trust the Google map for any confusion.

Decoration:
______________

The outside decoration is very simple and attractive. With hanging bulbs it's looks quite elegant. There were merely 6-7 table arrangements. Nothing special but decent.

Food:
________

We went there after pandle hopping, so we were totally drained out. When we went there we had to wait for 15 mins, they were very gentle and know how to welcome , served some drinking water when we were waiting in the outside tables.

Now coming to the main segment. Let's start with the beverages.

© Beverages:
_______________

✓ Cappachino : it was damn good. They had not added any flavour. What they did, they added salmon powder in it. And trust me that added the X factor in it. 

✓ Blue Lagoon : It was just the refreshment you wanted. Very very nice.

✓ Virgin Mojito : best among all. Owssum one. What I would say perfect refreshner and energy booster. We took it twice. It was that tastey and perfect chilled.

© Food:
___________

✓ Prawn Skewer : Six pieces of well sized prawn sauted in lemon marination , served with chips and dips. It was great. It was a part of their Puja special menu.

✓ Tossed Squids : Squids tossed in tangy sauce, served with mushroom and pineapple rice. I liked it. The tangy curry was that good.

✓ Sizzling Bhetki : this is just owssum. Bhetki fish of a good size ( 120 grm) served with rice Dal combo, yes it's like khichudi. The combination was just mind-blowing. Served with veggies. It was their chef special.

Each and every item we tasted were made with perfection. Little disappointed not to get their
Owsum pan cakes, heard a lot about it.

All that cost : 1150 for 3 heads.

Please Note : only cash are acceptable there ( not sure this is for Puja days only or not)

Their hospitality, food quality and the uniqueness were owssum. And in Puja , we always go parallel with pujo and pet pujo. Thank you for the owsum dishes and make the pujo more special.

Hope to see you guys again. Happy Pujo :)

A cute little cafe! Nice ambiance. Wallet-friendly. A good place to just hang out on your own.
The menu is short, but covers all the basics. Service was quick. Ordered ham sandwich and penne pasta in white sauce. Both were damn tasty.
My only gripe about this place is that they don't accept cards.

located a minute walk from ec block local market salt lake, 
Baker's nest looks cute with glass wodden doors amidst the greens, 

modern cafe ambiance with polite staffs
decor is minimal and neat

coming to the food, it has a continental menu. 
also serves a delightful breakfast combo at reasonable prices(although  it opens only around 11.30am) 

order chicken and cheese pancake, served with chips and fresh veggies giving it color

white sauce penne pasta was good and was presented well. 

loved the ambiance, 
will definitely visit again

Saltlake is getting filled with new cafes every week. Bakers Nest is an addition to this .a warm and cozy cafe that will make you feel at home. The food ordered was delicious  starting from the lip smacking bacon club sandwich to the chicken stroganoff . For desert we had ordered a choclate mousse which was average .. the cafe is a full value for money eatery and the staff is very coordial.

Ordered some food to office today for lunch. We ordered grilled fish, chicken stroganoff, chicken stake, prawn pancacke, tiramisu, fish meuniere. Taste was very basic, nothing wow. Chicken stake was too hard to chew off. Might got cold due to delivery time taken. Price is comparatively low. For 7 people it was around 1600. It was pocket friendly, but not tummy friendly.

Discovered this cosy place while going around in Salt Lake. After reaching the place went through the Menu and ordered Cheese Omlette and Veg Augratin. The service was pretty quick. The cheese Omlette had slight hint of cheese and came with two things slices of crispy bread. The Omlette was very well made and I would have loved, if more cheese was present 😀. The Veg Augratin which came with a Garlic Bun. The Augratin tasted awesome however the bun had almost no hint of garlic. My first experience was very good and I hope to visit you soon sometime.

Decor:
Its a new cafe in saltlake. Decor is simple and sober. There is nothing fancy in terms of decor or ambience to attract you.
Food:
We had chicken finger, chicken cheese pancake, grilled fish, Tira isu and baked Alaska. Food tastes great. Grilled fish and baked Alaska is a must try.
Budget :
Food here is value for money. After having the food you will never regret trying this place as it offers great food and does not pinch your pocket.

Service is quick and courteous . It's a must try place as it has the warmth to give you the feel good factor.

Well found this cafe after searching a lot in zomato.Dug into the place with a really nice decor.The staff were veryy polite and well behaved but the food here was not a turn on.It was veryyy basic and didn't have a waaooo factor. The Chicken and cheese pancake was the only thing that won the show but still the pancakes could have been lil thinner. The Fish belle meurine was first served with excess salt but then the staff were humble enough to immediately replace it for a new one but the white wine in the fish made the dish a flop.white wine was poured directly on the dish rather than being cooked. The refreshers were also ok-ok. Could have been much better.

The only thing bad about the place is that they do not accept cards.. but the good part is that the taxes are included in the prices printed in the menu

Breaking the bread has been an age old tradition since time immemorial, but today’s predicament has transformed it into a more stylized and globalized version where people don’t necessarily need to be in their white overalls enjoying the last supper, to break bread with their family, they can do it in the comfort of spacious and well lit up cafes where it’s not just about eating, but about eating, clicking pictures, checking in and posting pictures. Eating out has become more social than individual and thanks to cafes like Bakers Nest that caters to all these needs of foodies and cafe goers along with ticking all the necessary boxes in the wants and demands categories of its customers. The cafe mainly doesn’t try to be the jack of all trades and sticks to the continental domain; that is at its finger ends. The place also boasts of a live cake decoration and a huge kitchen, that is visible to the customers once they walk into the cafe.

The first thing that you feel when you enter the cafe is  the bliss of home comming. You don't feel as if ur in a cafe rather u feel it's ur home. The behaviour of the owner and the staff are extremely friendly and courteous. The food....fresh, great quality, moderate quantity and great in taste but not as spicy or as greasy as those are served in other cafes. It's like home made fresh good food. We had fish fry chicken fingers sandwiches cupcakes etc. All freshly made and having great quality. Service though had longer than usual time..but who cares! I mean as long as u get good food...u can wait that extra bit. Pocket pinch...not much. Overall quodos to the owner who runs this place. A must visit for all cafe lovers.

A cafe is always one of my favorite places where you can chill over a cup of coffee or you can spend hour and hour while chatting with your friends. now, most of the coffee shops are not only serves coffee, tea or cakes & pastries. there are few places where you can find like old days only coffee and limited food items. nowadays most of the cafes serve really good continental dishes. “Baker’s Nest” a small joint yet serves some really good food along with lip-smacking desserts. it has both outdoor and indoor seating section, around 20-24 people can sit and eat at a time. entire cafe is designed very well, the ambiance of the place also very nice. located in sector 1, EC -263, near EC local market, walking distance from City Center 1. indoor section is quite well maintained, various types of paintings are hung from the wall. you can see the kitchen from the indoor section.

The concept of having home based cafes has really caught the public eye and is now becoming a success wherever it is being established. In this case, Baker's Nest, situated in the quiet by-lanes of EC Block, has already made a name for itself due to its peaceful surroundings. It is a relaxed atmosphere once you enter the premises, the ambience, the warmth of the staff and the simple decor make you feel comfortable. I visited the place along with my younger brother, and from the time we had entered, both of us felt at peace. Our order included of Fish fingers for starters, and the main course included a baked chicken and a fish belle meuniere. The fish fingers did not please us as it lacked taste, probably was missing salt in the dish, although the potato wafers along with it tasted good. The main course was a great deal as both the dishes were spot on. The Bake Chicken's balance of cream and cheese was well measured, and was delicious in taste.  (A special mention for the bread, that was baked to perfection. It had a really great taste that suited the dish perfectly).
The Fish Belle Meuniere was another dish that was made to perfection. The taste was great as i have always been a huge fan of continental fish dishes plus white sauce. The only thing they should improve is the rice quantity. i had to order extra rice separately to satisfy my needs. But the overall experience was quite amazing. I will definitely come back to try the other items on the menu. Would like to thank the management for a fine experience of food and leisure.

Bakers make the world a better place.. And when it comes to freshly baked yummilicious plus healthy baked breads, cakes and many more then nothing can be better than that.
So Team Panchphoron was invited to this hidden gem to try out their mouthwatering freshly cooked delicacies. Situated near EC local market, Saltlake, walking distance from City Centre.
The decoration is really soothing and cozy homely ambience. The walls and seating arrangement are. aesthically decorated. The background soft music adds more elegance to it. The owner herself is v.friendly and the staffs are really corteous.
Now coming to the foods-
For Beverage we had

●VIRJIN MOJITO- It was v.refreshing and the presentation was unique indeed.
●DARJEELING EXOTIC TEA- Boosts up your energy within seconds. The presentation was just excellent. The tea bag was just wow. Its design is just like a fresh strawberry dipped in the cup. Excellent.
●COLD COFFEE was soothing. Finely brewed coffee served in small shot glasses.

Now for the mains we had
●CHICKEN AND CHEESE PANCAKE- Pancake with chicken in it and guey cheese and julian cut veggies on top of it. Served with potato chips. (3.5/5)
●CHICKEN STROGANOFF was just a perfect wholesome meal. Rice served with brown sauce and succlucent juicy sliced chicken presented uniquely with veggies and potato wedges. (4/5)
●GRILLED FISH- It was the show stopper. The tangy flavour in it pumps up your soul. Must try. Recommended! (5/5)
●CHICKEN STEAK was served with bun. And yaa the bun was gluten free freshly baked. The meat was juicy and succlucent served with brown sauce and potato wedges. Again a superstar. (5/5)

Desserts
●SMALL CUPCAKES were v.fresh and tasty. Again the presentation was excellent.
●PANCAKE WITH HONEY AND PEANUT was served hot. The honey and peanut added the punch in it.
●BAKED ALASKA- Woohooo!! The presentation was superb. The experience was amazing. It is basically a dessert made of icecream and pineapple topped with meringue. Now the main attraction is the cake is baked on the table itself with fire flame. Excellent.
We were served with their breads whuch were very fresh.
Overall a very nice experience and highly recommended.
And yes I am a proud member of team Panchphoron!

It’s always very relaxing to dine in at some places very cosy and soothing, having an unorthodox style making you comfortable in the very 1st attempt.  The newly opened Baker’s Nest has to be one of those places for me. This place Located on EC 263, Near EC Local Market, Sector 1, Salt Lake, Kolkata. The ambiance being pretty comforting, sending a positive vibe with the interior will definitely attract you straightaway. They brought out some amazing dishes based on their innovation baking and the best example is use of baking method in few of their dishes. With ample seating capacity, also having open seating area outside of this Home based cafe .  I was here with my fellow foodies friends for dinner and was very much pleased with the food and few items satisfied my taste buds to the core.

This is a new cafe in Salt Lake and is a lovely place to spend time with friends. It's very affordable and the owner herself is usually present there and she makes sure everything is perfect.
One might have a little problem to locate it in the lanes of Salt Lake but it's totally worth the search.
My personal recommendation here would be: Cheese and Chicken pancakes and Baked Chicken. 
This place should definitely be on your list when you are low on budget but want to spend some good time.

A new cafe in Salt Lake is always welcome for us, since we hang out so much in this area...

This one is in EC block, near City Centre. True to an emerging trend, the ground floor of a house has been converted to a very pretty cafe. The decor is perfectly done in beige and brown shades - and there is seating for more than 50 people. Apart from sandwiches, pastas and continental main course, it also serves fresh baked muffins and pastries.

The roasted tea and black coffee were standard, served in little glass cups and saucers, with lace dollies. The Chello Kabab was surprisingly good - fried fish, chicken skewers, mashed potatoes, buttered rice and fried egg. The egg and chicken sausage club sandwich, served with potato wafers, was excellent to say the least.

We will surely be coming back again to try more!

Went to this place today and I am blown away. They serve amazing food and are so hospitable. Plus, no taxes.
Coming to the food-
We took fish finger, Chicken steak and grilled chicken. Fish finger was one of the best I have had. Normally the coating is more than the filling but here they maintain the quality and quantity of the fish per finger. 
The chicken steak was exceptionally well cooked and is highly recommended.
My friend took grilled chicken and he loved it. 

In a moment of utter callousness, I broke a glass on my way out and they couldn't be more polite. They didn't charge me and did not accept when I offered to help them clean. I was really taken by this sweet treatment.

So, do check out this place for really amazing food.
Also, they bake their own bread and it is delicious.

The Baker's nest was a place I wanted to visit because my friends said it was really good
Either had an off day or my friends don't understand food 😅
Was a bit disappointed
Ordered the following
1) Chicken fingers - was good, not great but could have used a bit more seasoning
2) Fish Belle- Signature dish probably but the fish could have been softer and the sauce was lacking salt, otherwise was ok and the bread was really good
3) tangy squid- It was good, loved the taste, and the mushroom rice was well cooked
4) Chicken and cheese pancake- Normal pancake with chicken and cheese on top of it, wasn't that impressive
5) chicken steak- The chicken was undercooked, it was a disappointment coz otherwise the seasoning was done good

The best thing was the muffin, must try
Loved it

The ambience was good and warm

Had chicken and cheese pancakes, cold coffee, virgin mojito, brownie and vanilla icecream, jam and chocolate cookies. I also took home a freshly baked choco chip muffin. The cold coffee was definitely the showstopper for me here! I have had cold coffee at a lot different places but something about this one was different and amazing! Their baked items had a special homemade appeal. The only thing that I didn't like about them was the fact that they were a bit too sweet for my taste. The brownie lacked the gooeyness of the fudge that I usually enjoy. The chicken and cheese pancake was light and delicious and nothing like I had tasted before. Overall food was good! Nice ambience and good music added to the experience. Warm behavior from the staff. Will definitely visit again.

Had dinner at this place with friends last weekend. A nice setting with good ambience. The food was good; especially the starters were great (chicken fingers and fried prawn)! The chello and the chicken steak were good (the steak was not so well made which I had asked for), the baked fish was excellent and the proportion served was more than enough. The owner was very amicable and warm; she personally looked after our orders (and of the others). 
A small cafe but has the potential to be one of the best continental joints in Saltlake. I cannot say the food exceeded my expectations, but definitely was worth the visit. 
Over all this place is must visit for all food lovers!

Visited this newly opened place recently, it's not very good. The service was prompt because I think the owner was there and she took a special interest. But the food is not that good. Prices are very reasonable.

Homely ambience, feel like sitting in home drawing dining area n sipping the nutmeg flavoured coffee wit some very light cheese toast amidst indulgence in chat wit friend, book or work.. The staff are so helpful m mk u feel cosy as per food customisation or seats.. To end i tried banana panacake wich ws quite like from home kitchen.. Not too sweet wit heavy caramel sauce.. It truly made my tired Evenin after wrk soothe up... 
Not for people who expect high services n plattwr quality like fine dine or chain cafe.. 
Its a home space..

Food was really good. Not heavy on the wallet. Sandwiches are out of this world. And do look out for deserts. I had the tiramisu which was pretty good considering the price. Though the pancakes weren't up to the mark since you will notice the absence of cheese in the sauce. Other than that, quality and quantity was spot on. Keep it up.

Not always you find an aesthetically pleasing cafe in Kolkata, Baker's nest is a cafe cum restaurant which serves mouthwatering baked dishes. They are very much polished in the art of culinary.
It's a cozy restaurant with not so much clingy tables, so you can enjoy your privacy. Their way of plating is authentic and visually pleasing.
Coming to their food, I went there today (20/08/2017) for the birthday celebration of an uncle.
We tried Fish Steak, Fish Belle Muniere, Chicken Steak, Chicken Pasta, Baked Chicken and last but not the least Baked Alaska.
Starting off with Fish Steak, it was well cooked, aromatic with the appropriate amount of herbs. It was on the sweet and sour side so it had a variety of flavors which went really well with their Buns which they specially make themselves which is "GLUTEN FREE", yes it is true they make fresh buns and serve them directly taking them out of the oven.
Fish Belle Meuniere came with white sauce gravy which went really well with the Buttered Rice and sautéed mushrooms.
The Chicken Steak was a classic, it needs no introduction. Chicken was succulent and juicy as it should be.
Chicken Pasta was as classic as possible so i won't elaborate on it.
Coming to Baked Chicken, it's a must try. It's so creamy and cheesy, you'll feel your lost in the world of cheese with some succulent dices of chicken.
Lastly Baked Alaska is something which you don't get everywhere so try this here, it's completely an experience when they bake it with flaming the alcohol on your table itself.
Because we were celebrating a birthday party, they even provided us with a complimentary cake which was a pleasant gesture.
Looking forward to visiting this place again very soon.

Glad that I put my trust on zomato reviews and visited this newly opened cafe this evening. Located in one corner of EC block, (right beside EC market )  finding out the true location could be quite a mess. However Google maps had been our last resort.
It's a cute little cafe, pretty decently themed and with a very warm hospitality. We tried Chicken Finger which was okayish and Cheese Chicken Pie which is sort of a signature dish here. 
Pocket pinch is economical and staff is pretty much courtious. 
Moreover a good experience and would surely visit very soon.

Visited this place on 17th August. My brother is a regular here and he is the one on whose recommendation I decided to visit the place.
It's a quite place tucked away within EC Block.
There was some nice music and the ambience was really good. There were candles which they lit up if someone wants and its perfect for those on a date.
Coming to the food, we ordered the Baked Chicken which came with a bread. Let me tell you it was heavenly. The baked chicken has a layer of pasta, followed by a layer of grilled capsicum and then a layer of chicken and it was sealed with cheese. Oh so much molten cheese! Also the bread was amazing and super soft. Then we tried the Chicken and Cheese Pancakes which was yet again an amazing dish. The quantity is really good and 2 dishes were more than enough for the 2 of us. The waiters were really good and made us feel at home. Definately going back real soon.

After reading really good reviews,hubby and I decided to try it out on independence day. Not very difficult to located... It's tucked below a house not very far away from city centre. We took our seats and were greeted well. We started lunch with a cream of chicken soup and garlic bread, the soup was a disappointment ... Thin, flavourless and it had no salt at all,on complaining the staff took it away and added salt.. the taste was still sad. Our garlic bread was yummy though. For main course we had the baked chicken on our servers recommendation and were informed we would be served a cappuccino free with it due to happy hours. The baked chicken again was just so so. The salt again was less and I found a eggy smell in it, maybe baking it a little more would do justice. The cappuccino they talked about was never served. All in all this place was disappointing. The only good thing was very very courteous staff.

This was my second visit to this lovely cafe in EC block, it feels so homely there food is awesome, innovative & healthy. Have tried masala tea, fish finger, & chellow kebab on my first visit and packed some cute cupcakes for my niece, the staff's were courteous & the food was excellent. Today we went to celebrate my brothers anniversary & the owner herself baked an yummilicious chocochip cake topped with extra chocolate sauce in just 15mins & made our celebration grand. They maintain all hygiene & health norms. Highly recommended!!

Bakers nest, they actually go with their name, coz just like a normal nest, this place is situated in the most interior lanes of saltlake. Well thats not an issue here. The issue is the food. They serve you with a limited food menu that too which has no taste at all. Ordered a veg cheese sandwich and a non veg club sandwich, which tasted horrible. I doubt if they themself would like their own creativity. No taste at all and probably no knowledge of the sauce to be used in the respective sandwiches. Left the place with a ruined taste bud. Though keeping aside the negatives, was really surprised with a couple of positives. Firstly, cinnamon in black coffee, which was surprisingly good. So hats off for this bold addition which turned out to be pretty good. Secondly, they treated us with a complimentary, couple of tiny cupcakes which was a real warm gesture from their end. Overall, the experience here was not so good coz they do require some modifications in their chef section. Pocket pinch: Average.

The place is located in one of the by-lanes of salt lake's EC block. Its's Aesthetics from outside, will compel you to enter the bistro. And straightway you would be made to feel at home. This is an holistically owner operated place which brings more passion on the table. I did try their chelo on the first day & baked chicken during my next visit. Both cooked to perfection & i left the noshery, craving for more..

Firstly, i want to congratulate the person concerned with the organisation of this restaurant. I went there feeling nice because of the fact that there is no continental restaurant near my house, the first thing which pleased me was a very warm smile of the owner and his mother. The cozy behaviour brought a smile on my face because the behaviour of the owners and staffs is something which i am very critical about. Now lets move on the ambience, the restaurant is big enough and very cozy and the best part is that there is a provision for having a candle light dinner which increases the charm of this restaurant. I was dying to eat pasta and therefore i ordered one  penne chicken pasta in white sauce and one chicken penne pasta salad, the penne pasta in white sauce was served with two slices of garlic bread and it tasted fabulous, the pasta salad was good and the service was brilliant as well, the food was served within 15 minutes. All in all i am more than satisfied but there is one issue which is regarding the pasta salad, i ordered for chicken pasta salad but unlike the chicken pasta there was very insignificant amount of slices of chicken. Still i will surely visit this restaurant

Went there just because this place is new and I wanted to try some of the items after reading the reviews on Zomato itself.
The place has a very pretty gardened entrance. And ambience is really peaceful and the staffs are also really courteous.
Now coming to the food we had:
1. Ham Club sandwich- It had the the right amount of ham, bacon, eggs. They serve it with plain potato chips.
2. Grilled Chicken: It was a bit tangy with the sauce it was tossed in. But the chicken was really succulent. Served with vegetables and mashed potatoes.
3. Chicken and Cheese Pancakes: It was a bit on the drier end. With lots and lots of cheese but a bit less amount of chicken it was a bland to be honest.
4. Baked Alaska: It was a fruit desert with flambe. They light the desert in fire. It is one of their specialties. Maybe it was our fault that we didn't blow the flame out, so basically our desert got a bit more burnt than it should have been and it tasted bitter with all the ingredients it was lit with.
Overall I would surely love to visit again to try the other items on the menu.
Happy fooding ✌

Baker's Nest is an ideal place for anyone who loves to eat in peace and chat for hours.Today afternoon I had been to the cafe with few friends.It wasn't crowded at all infact we were the only customers at 3 in the afternoon.Its a cute little place with a homely atmosphere very close to city centre,salt lake.We ordered chicken finger for starters which was really good though we didn't like the sauce it was served with.Luckily,when we went it was happy hour and we were offered a free cappuccino with every main course you ordered which was kindda nice.Everyday they have happy hour from 2pm to 5pm.The lady who owns the place is so cordial.After having the hot cappuccino,we had ordered grilled fish,fish belle meuniere and baked chicken for main course.Out of which I personally liked fish belle meuniere the most.They also have cute yummy cup cakes and brownies for just 50rs each.I really liked the ambience,though I feel the cafe needs to play some good music. However,its a pocket friendly option for people wanting to spend some quality time munching some good food.

Visited this place on a weekday afternoon where they offered a free cappuccino along with the main course as a Happy hour offer. We tried the cold coffee and chicken fingers. Though the chicken fingers were good the dip was too sweet for my liking. For main course we had the baked chicken which was a delight for us cheese lovers. The grilled fish and the Fish belle meuniere were also good. For dessert we had the chocolate muffin and brownies. Overall it was quite good. Will definitely visit again.

What is the one cuisine that is hardly affordable in kolkata?continental, ofcourse..amidst the profusion of chinese, mughlai  n "multi-cuisine" lost in the translation restaurants, a good, affordable, continental restaurant is amiss..of course we have the jw marriotts n the hyats but us common folk with a proclivity towards all things cheesy n continental would mostly have to give those places a miss.

Enter..Baker's Nest and oh what a glorious entry it is into the mouth n eventually the heart of us shallow-  pocket gourmands😍😍

I have been ordering food from this outlet for the past week and i just can't stop going back. I have so far  had the cheese and fish pancake, ham omlette, bacon sandwich , chello kebab, fried fish , chicken stroganoff and baked alaska and i still have quite a few menu items i want to tick off my taste list.

So what do we gather from this?
1. They have quite an exhaustive menu
2. The food is so good that sometimes i end up ordering twice in a day
3. They passed with flying colors two checkpoints in continental cooking...absolutely creamy,smooth as silk mashed potatoes with perfect salt n pepper level and blanched veggies with just the right amount of crunchiness
4. Their chello kebab is a perfect wholesome meal and at rs.240 a steal.
5. My only complaint and i am really nit picking here is serving potato wafers..no one wants potato chips..just serve french fries instead..oh n if maybe the fried fish batter can be lighter..i mean maybe it can be a beer batter and then it wont put my guilt radars up so much..its like eating a clogged artery..don't misunderstand folks, it's delicious , just too indian butter fry style rather than continental fried fish..just a thought
6. The baked alaska is one of the best desserts to come out of any kitchen so far..yeah it's that good..hope to find the chocolate muffin n other baked goods in the online menu

So, this gem of an outlet is a must to visit or order from and believe me , once you taste their food and see that there isn't a gaping hole in your pocket either, you will keep going back.I know i will.

P.S- try baked alaska (their signature dish).
And all breads used to make their dishes are handmade here with no added Preservatives. Enjoy.

Well, this place in the bylanes of EC block in Salt Lake is truly a hidden treasure! The "small" outlet is not at all small by the food it serves. As you enter you get that homely feel with wooden Tables and chair and warm greetings. We ordered Cream of Mushroom soup, Chello Kebab and Fish Belle Meuniere, which for those who love fish, is a heavenly dish!! Must try for all..The only downside was the soup, it could have been a bit thicker, although the taste was really good.
Adding to that there are also pastries, muffins and cakes(all of which are made in-house, fresh) of which we ordered some for take away.
In short, this place is a must try for all foodies out there!

The beautiful gardened entrance to this little gem and the warm interiors done in light colonial style will surely soothe your soul the moment you step in .Satisfy your continental cravings with the wide range of choices , Icing on the cake is their hospitality with a touch of formality will surely make you fall for the place in no time. On the first visit ,
We tried the PANCAKES WITH HONEY AND PEANUTS , soft and fluffy made of an eggless recipe , pancakes lovers shouldn't miss trying one here.
The CHICKEN STEAK was my favourite out of everthing i tried here , the brown sauce topped was fickerlinging good , accompanied with sauteed vegetables and a bun.
 The BAKED FISH is going to give you a huge calorie attack loaded with portions of fresh kolkata bhetki , penne pasta and oodles of white sauce(could be made better) and cheese. The gluten free buns served with the main courses were spot on , one needs to check out their homemade breads for sure.
 The BAKED ALASKA looked stunning with flambe that was done on table.
The only negetive was the consistency of CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP , way too thin than desired and personally i don't like diluted soups at all. But apart from this little flaw , the cafe scores full marks in all aspects .

The next visit we had :
GRILLED CHICKEN , could have been softer with mashed potato and vegetables, the portion was not sufficient to stand as a main course , so an additional serving of rice/bread/bun could have  made it sumptuous , also the wine sauce that topped it be made of a better recipe.
TANGY PRAWNS was one confused dish , named 'tangy' and described as 'lemon butter sauce' and the dish actually served as six sizeable prawns in tasteless white sauce , and entire mismatch without any carbohydrate side to complete the main course. We had to order an additional portion of bread roll.
The CHICKEN AND CHEESE PANCAKE was again great , and absolutely value for money. However i feel they can improve on the white sauce of each dish , it tastes bland , not delicious.
My recommendation goes for the steaks, buns and pancakes.

This is a nice little cozy place located in one of the lanes of EC block Salt Lake near EC market. The place is a bit hard to locate however the posters along the way and google map guided us to this nook. the ground floor of the house has been converted into a cafe. the small Cafe joint concept has indeed started gripping salt lake as well.

The food is freshly cooked and delicious. the decoration is simple with eye catchy furniture. the fresh bakery items are so inviting and delectable. the madam who runs the shop is indeed polite and friendly and personally interacted with us to know the feedback. all other staff were cordial as well. the service time is also not much. Considering the food quantity and quality  the prices are also pocket friendly . worth visiting again and again :) 

Must haves- chicken cheese pancakes, pancakes with chocolate syrup, grilled chicken sandwich, muffins

Visited the place couple of times, easy to locate provided you take the help of google map. Residential area hence parking isn't an issue. Homely ambience. Comfortable decor and mesmerised with the hospitality and to add, excellent food. We tried out different steaks and fish fingers and chelo kebab, it had the exact amount of spices and was extremely tasty and with fresh vegetables. To add in to the mood they have the perfect music with some old English tracks. The fish steak(bhetki) was sumptuous and yummy with a taste of red wine and perfectly grilled. Not an expensive place at all. 

Suggestions - Please arrange other payment methods other than cash. 
Quantity can increase and so the price of the dishes.
All the best to the management.

Ordered for Grilled Chicken and cheese toast. Packing was nice, so was the quantity and taste. Was slightly unhappy about the delay in delivery, which also resulted in food getting cold by the time it was delivered. Liked the fact that they called up to take feedback after the food was delivered.

Ambience great.
Staff great.
Food tastes like heaven.
Obvious that a second visit is much needed. Will bring more friends over baked chicken.

I ordered mix sauce pasta. The food was great no delivery charges was a great thing. Moreover quick delivery. But I will suggest the restaurant to accompany the compliments in proper condition and delivery charges in future. Rest is all good.

Ambience: A cosy little place in a quiet residential area close to City Centre Salt Lake. It has a soothing atmosphere with light music in the background and pretty decorations. 5/5
Food: We started with desert, Baked Alaska, which was a unique item on the menu. It was very well prepared. Then we had chicken white sauce pasta which was the best dish we had there. It was cooked to perfection. Exactly as one would like their creamy white pasta to be. Next was the chelo kebab which had fried fish, chicken kebab, rice, mashed potatoes and vegetables. Except the mashed potatoes, we relished the rest of the items on the plate. Quantity of each dish was enough for two. It is not very heavy on the pocket and cost us 480 for 2 people. 4.5/5
Service: Quick service. The owner personally oversees the service. Polite and helpful staff. 5/5
Recommended.

Situated near City Centre, this place offers some excellent food. Limited menu but great quality. Few of the advantages being the pocket friendly pricing and dining room ambience. 

PS: Try Baked Alaska if you have a craving for a light dessert.
