This sweet shop is on the opposite side of ballygunge Birla Mandir. Normal sweet shop with all kinds of sweets.   Pocket pinch reasonable. Sweets are fresh.

Gulab jamuns and kamalabhohs are to die for... Yummmm... The shop is pocket friendly and provides some best quality sweets... I am not saying about the variety or innovative or fusion sweets... They sail authentic trademark sweets like barfi laddu gulab jamun sandesh but the quality is superb.

Located near the Chinese Pavilion at the Ballygunj Phari crossing. Though the prices are on higher side, i still like their badam barfi and kachori.

Kolkata is full of such sweet shops, didn't fond something like wow or very amazing. Its just a small air conditioned sweet shop located on the main road ballygunge. Which i fpnd clean anx hygienic, though price is on the higher side.
What i know is they are famous for sweets gift wrapping whatever occasion it is.
I tried their milk cake while crossing one day, and it was very nice. Best from kolkata. So now whenever i get a chance i visit this place just for their milkcakes. Though they have good range of snacks too. . 
All the ratings just for their milkcakesðŸ˜Š Recommended!!.

Kolkata is full of such sweet shops...they serve sweets and vegetarian quick items. Given the rise in the price of raw materials the sweets are on the pricey side.

Serves some tasty snacks and delicious sweets. Ambitious was average. Hospitality and service were also okay okay. Staff were friendly but service was bit slow. In snacks their dahi vada and raj kachori were very tasty and in sweets their badam barfi and rasmalai were very delicious. Taste were good but price was bit high. You may visit for some tasty snacks and delicious sweets but it's cost your pocket little high.

Quite surprised to find that not much people have reviewed this place which is at the very prominent area of ballygunge phari opposite Birla Mandir. They serve yummy sweets , tasty dhoklas, paneer sandwiches, samosas, the gulab jamuns are mouth watering and the mishti doi is also very tasty.

This is located opposite to Birla mandir. I visited this place a couple of times. This place serves non Bengali kind of sweets. Their samosa is good. Their plain potato chips is very nice.

Located just next to my residence. Whenever I feel hungry and I'm in a mood to have Kochuris, or other snacks, I run to this place. The snacks are quite good, especially the kochuris, and the aloor dom they serve with it is lip smacking.
The Chinese Samosa is not the best I've had.
The sweets range from very good to average.

A decent place for a snack, is Gangotri. For breakfast I often have the club kachoris with aloo, which are quite filling and at a reasonable price within that locality. The dhoklas (made in idli moulds) are quite soft and moist and the chutney is excellent. The dahi vada is decent but occasionally the vada is too tough and the dahi does not penetrate inside as a result of which the vada remains lumpy. The chinese samosa or whatever it is that obscure thing which is looks like a samosa and is stuffed with noodles, is called, is the only thing I don't like. The sweets are not too bad. Their best food item in my opinion is the kachori. Its more of a take away joint but you may choose to stand there and eat too. The shop itself is well maintained and clean. Perhaps the prices are a tad bit high but that probably has more to do with the locality than anything else.

nice place for sweets... but I mainly care for the various chats... mouth watering as they are. the food otherwise it's quite good... and you will usually like what they give you. 
but snacks is a completely veg affair..... and keep that in mind before planning a trip. veg food.. 
kachoris rock... also try the dahi chaat
