The biriyani was average , the rolls and kababs tasted better. The parathas were doughy and lacked proper seasoning. A good place in Sodepur for quick bites.We did a take away for the food items and it was quick.

Always believed great taste in Punjabi food but foods from punjabi food junction and Punjabi food station is the shame of Punjab. Tandoor Roti or Naan are horrible as made of simple wheat. Dishes with chicken are tasteless. And here comes the real pain- Service. Wait. You can't expect fast service and good behaviour. How they still exists that's the real question.

With my college being near by, me and my friends visit this place quite frequently. And I love this joint. The food is served is quite delicious. Especially their schezwan noodles and manchurian, which is our almost everytime's order. We also tried their Indian dishes which is also very delicious. Staff are well-behaved. Overall, no complaints. :)

Not at all good. Yesterday I went there. We ordered seekh kabab. They said it will take 30-45 minutes. So we cancelled it. Then we ordered chicken lollipop which was not at all good. The chicken inside it was stuffed very badly. A complete waste of 200 bucks. 
And about ambience, we went to AC part of the restaurant, that was not at all comfortable because I don't know the AC was on or not. It was very hot.

Overall not a decent place.

Ideal Roll counter it is. Not a sit & dine joint.

my review is not based on any dishes or dine in expereince b'coz i just went at this "well known joint" of this area for some "hot tandoori roties" (takeaway)..

placed order ... paid the sum.. for 7 tandoori roties..
i was standing just next to the roti section... 3 of the 7 roties were ready freshly taken out from the tandoor...

..now comes this punjabi guy with aviator specs ...who oders the roti maker to add the rest 4 roties.. from a box.. which contained already made roties... the roties looked rubbery n cold ... i then stepped in and confronted the guy... and asked if those were fresh or not.. he 1st said .... they dont serve old roties ... and then that punjabi guy had the odacity to say ''lena hai toh lo warna paise le jao"..
after a minute of confrontation... as expected he didnt change the old roties...
....and as expected those turned out to be hard like tires while having them..

..well i know this review wont make any change in the restaurant's bussiness or popularity or the behavior of that stupid guy...
BUT IF SOMEDAY ...ANYBODY FROM THE MANAGEMANT WATCHES MY REVIEW...THEN.....
a piece of a advice to the management of this newly opened restaurant...
DONT MESS WITH THE LOCALS.. AND BE POLITE.. BECAUSE ....A large sum of locals are here for more than 50 years...

Last but not least, the chicken kadai was horrible... Surprised to see Punjabi restaurant doesn't know how to make chicken kadai (elsewhere it was named kadai chicken)... Chicken pieces r like rubber & gravy was undercooked & substandard... Even roadside substandard takeaway shops are better than their "chicken kadai".. üëéüëéüëéüëé

The best restaurant of sodepur !!!!!! Food quality is very good. They also provide good quantity. The price is reasonable. Behavior of the waiters is good.
This restaurant is situated near our home.Me and my would be hubby visited here two times. First time ordered chicken reshmi kebabs,rumali rooti & mutton tarka. Kebabs are too good in taste. Tarka is yummy. Second time ordered chicken 65,chicken tandoori,mutton biryani. Biryani tastes very good. The quantity was also too much that couldn't eat the full plate. Tandooris are delicious. Chicken 65 was boneless & the chicken pieces were too big. Overall this is excellent. Also tasted here the rolls. Egg chicken kebab roll is very good in taste. So, people, must try this restaurant at the station road, Sodepur, opposite of loksanskriti bhawan.

A special vegetarian dish called mushroom paneer is a must try and the kadhai chicken is mouth watering. This restaurant has great ambience and very good service.  Maximum people prefer taking parcels for home. If you are a resident of sodepur this eatery is definitely worth a visit.

Within walking distance from Sodepur Station Road and BT Road junction, Punjabi Food Junction is new eatery with both AC and nonAC facilities. Ordered masala kulcha, chicken handi and lassi. Foods were very tasty and served hot. Though the excess amount of chopped green chilli in chicken handi was unnecessary and made it too spicy, the dish was very tasty nonetheless. Lassi was really good with no useless flavour or excessive sweetness, but typical thick unadulterated punjabi preparation.
Only negative points would be inside illumination, water logged single basin and sitting arrangement.
.
On second visit, I had chicken malai kebab and chicken sweet corn soup. The portions were adequate for one person, and tasted amazing. Finally flushed the whole food down the esophagus with lassi.

This food joint has two branches one opp to Lok Sanskriti Bhawan another one is at H.B.Town. I have tried many dishes from both of the branches but what  I simply gorge is their egg chicken roll which costs Rs. 60/- it's really delicious. They also offer some awesome kabab, I like the hariyali kabab, Reshmi kabab and their tandoori items are also good. But their fish item really disappointed me..We ordered for fish finger but it was smelly may b the fish was stale. Fried rice is not bad. Chicken manchurian or chilly chicken is so so. The lassi they offer is simply lip-smaking. The seating arrangement of HB town branch is quite good. So what I recommend to taste are their egg chicken roll, kababs and lassi.

I oftenly visit this place while in return home from office for their special roll or chowmin. According to price the quantity is good. Specially for the special roll, in 100 bucks you are getting double egg, chicken,mutton. So it's a gain for you. You can also order the beriyani. Both chicken and mutton are good,though I am a mutton lover so I will recommend you the mutton beriyani. All the tandoor items are also good. I never take a dine in here,but I took away food to my home,and yes,it was very delicious. In sodepur khardah area it's the best restaurant. üòä

Specially for the special roll, in 100 bucks you are getting double egg, chicken,mutton. So it's a gain for you. You can also order the beriyani. Both chicken and mutton are good,though I am a mutton lover so I will recommend you the mutton beriyani. All the tandoor items are also good. I never take a dine in here,but I took away food to my home,and yes,it was very delicious. In sodepur khardah area it's the best restaurant. üòä

Been there few days ago with help of one of my friend's suggestion.

Location is very simple. The restaurant situated at a stone throwing distance from Sodpur Traffic More.

They had a roll counter outside and Dine in facility is available in both A.C and Non A.C room.
No extra such decoration, basic table chair sitting arrangement.

But ¬†the service is very good and the management is very responsive too. All working stuffs are very helpful to choose your dish and polite also.

We ordered Chicken Malai Kabab and Mixed Gravy Chowmin.

Malai Kabab - In one word, it was just woww....Soft juicy chicken, well marinated and grill with herbs and cream on top. Just awesome in one word. 6Pieces kababs were there..The green chatney which was provided along with is also good. Overall super recommended.

Gravy Chowmin - We ordered it as a main course item. It came in a big bowl which is quantity wise enough for two persons. Lots of veggies like Broccoli, ¬†Capsicum, Onion etc. Large amount of Chicken, prawn, eggs were also there. Good in taste and one bowl is more more enough to fill your empty tummy..Gravy was really good and all the ingredients that are used in it are also cooked very well..Try it, if you are a fan of Gravy Chow.

With all two item mentioned above it cost around only 400INR, which is very reasonable and pocket friendly also. In conclusion, the restaurant is best in its area. Pocket friendly and good quality food, when you get these two things together, I don't think there remain no hesitation to visit this restaurant.

Only opted for take-away, however the dine-in area was pretty nicely decorated.¬†
Coming to the food, need to work on that. A lot.¬†
First of all when I asked them what the 'chicken lababdar' was like, they had no clue and kept calling other people. The fourth guy was ultimately able to answer, however the dish was nothing like he described it. He said it was a white and slightly sweet gravy, but in reality it was pretty similar to the chicken curry we ordered. The chicken pieces are pretty big in all their dishes, but the chicken items are priced a bit on the higher side.¬†
And the food gave me a stomach upset for the next couple days, so probably won't go back unless they improve.

Visited the place for the 1st time. The entrance is quite shabby. They have a separate AC and Non AC section. The food quality and quantity is what amazed me. I ordered chinese. It was quite a nice experience.

Food quality was very good. Love it. Cheap price but good in quality. Atlast sodepur got a good restaurant where college students can feed their appetizer at low budget. The place is not so good. But inside it is quite satisfying. Air conditioned. Service was also good.

Finally!!! Sodepur has got a place to dine! I had kebabs, butter tandoori roti and chicken korma...they did full justice...tasted awesome. Improvisations can be made in respect of serving and decoration..They can cut out on the chinese menu...is it really needed for a punjabi restaurant? Dont think so..

Situated 5 mins away from sodpur station towards madhamgram. Quite good restaurant with good ambience and well behaved staff. Quite spacious also and nice interior. Food quality is not so exceptional rather not disappointing. Tried tengri butter masala, tandoori and butter naan. Bread items have some defects, its too much brunt. They wont charge tax. Takeaway pricing are little bit less than dine in pricing. Overall worth visiting.

Food quality is not good service is bad. Been there with family order for paneer butter masala and paneer mushroom there is no as such  differences in  both dishes. They both are cooking in same greavy only difference is one with mushroom and other one is  with out mishroom. Asked for butter naan was served cold and hard. Too much flies inside the restaurant and tables were not clean had to ask for that. And all item were over priced.

Overpriced menu in comparison to the quantity served. I ordered a simple butter chicken gravy and to my surprise, it was not at all tasted like butter chicken. Also, quality of chicken was not good, it was like a rubber piece.

I'll neither go to this restaurant again nor recommend anyone.
