The location is seriously convenient. A great drop in place for real hungry passers by.

It's quiet and you can sit there for a long time.
I was really hungry and in a hurry when I decided to have a quick bite there.

Chicken and corn brown sandwitch : 3.5/5 : It is having a pretty big size, enough to calm down your stomach. It wasn't dry. The taste of chicken is average and nothing special to be liked.

What I did not like is, the sanswitch was too much stuffed with corns. Like with each bite corns will tangentially fly out and create a mess on the plate. And it is overpriced. Rs 85/- is absolutely not worth it.

But again, good place for a fast and modestly tasting gulps.

This bakery cum cafe is our most frequently visited place. It is reasonable and the food is good too. I buy biscuits from this place almost on a daily basis. 
If you want to have a light snack, do try the chicken and corn sandwich, ask them to heat it a bit. It tastes really good and its filling too. 
Also, the egg sandwich and chicken burger are good too and filling. The price is reasonable. Food is fresh. 
I don't recommend their pastries though.

This is a decent place located in golpark beside the purnadas road petrol pump.I used to visit this outlet a lot.They serve good quality coffee & evening munchies.
 Seating capacity is 20-24 I think.service is ok.
Wide collection of cookies & biscuit.
Butter scotch pastry is too good.

The reason why I gave this 3.5 instead of 3 like other just baked outlets , is their Grilled Sandwich.

I am not sure how many of you are aware of this information and hence thought of sharing with you all. 

The Golpark (Golpark Purna Das road crossing beside Petrol Pump) and the City centre 1, Saltlake , are the only 2 ‚ÄúJUST BAKED‚Äù outlets in Kolkata which make Grilled Sandwich ( both Veg and non veg option) with or without Mayonnaise sauce as per your request. This is not part of the regular menu and not available in any other outlet of theirs. 

I tried this today and loved it. It was extremely well made and filling too. 

It‚Äôs priced at Rs. 90/-

I had my usual fav chicken egg sandwich too.

I have a gripe about their confectionary. I had once ordered blueberry muffin for a quick tiffin, but it was so dry that I had to actually drink water with every bite to lubricate my throat. Also, the number of blueberries, a favourite of mine, was just 3!! While making my payment, I did give my feedback to the person at the counter....but I haven‚Äôt been able to muster up the courage to taste it once again to check if it has improved since then.

Visited this place a few days back to have a quick adda session with two of my friends. This place is has a seating capacity for about 20-25 people and the ambience is quite soothing because of the white interiors. 
We ordered a Chicken Quiche , a Schezwan Chicken Hot Dog and a Chocolate Truffle Pastry.
The quiche was delightful. It had a very cheesy and creamy taste in it which was quite appealing to the taste buds!
The Schezwan Chicken Hot Dog was good but there was nothing related to Schezwan in it. Though it tasted decent ,it did not justify the name.
The Chocolate Truffle Pastry was awesome. Goey and chocolatey, we had a melt in the mouth experience. It was really good.
Would definitely visit again for try out other snacks,desserts and beverages!
Happy Fooding ‚ù§

I just visited this shop for the Rainbow cake. This is one of the best pastrie I have tasted till date. From the colour and decoration, till the last bite, you'll celebrate your indulgence in this pastry. It's a must try if you are going there. The price is also very reasonable compared to other cake shops. It costed only Rs46. Will definitely try this next time.

This place is situated close to the petrol pump. Being one of the very first outlets of this chain in Kolkata, this place is way better than many other outlets. It is clean and keeps many items in stock. Hence, an item going out of stock is a rare occurrence here. I had ordered Chicken Supremo, Chicken Croissant and Hot Coffee Mix.


Chicken Supremo (4/5): This is, perhaps, a newly introduced item in Just Baked as I had never seen this in any outlet on my previous visits. It is a well prepared item with ample of chicken pieces. A must try for all. It is not dry unlike many other items Just Baked serves.



Chicken Croissant (3.5/5): There is nothing much to mention about this item. Quantity is good but the dryness of the bun, at times, predominates over the tasty filling.



Hot Coffee Mix(3.5/5): Normal coffee served with sugar cubes. Tastewise, it was decent. You might give it a try incase you are a coffee lover.




A nice place serving good items at reasonable rates. A perfect place for grabbing a quick snack.

My review is based on the pastries that I had yesterday evening with my friends.. Located to the right annexed to the petrol pump at the Purna Das Road while coming via Golpark..

The outlet is quite spacious with black and white chair-tables...A good number of packed snacks, sandwiches, pastries and cakes are housed at the racks around the whole bakery shop...

We ordered a Butterscotch and a Chocolate crunch pastry..Am an ardent chocolate lover yet was amused to like the butterscotch pastry over the chocolate crunch.. the latter lacked the rich creamyness of chocolate...I was indeed disappointed as none seem to be great..

I believe they were overpriced as per quality and taste...but yes one gets to sit here for a while in an airconditioned base rescuing their sudden hunger pangs with friends...this gesture definitely is priced at the bill...thus its justified...

Next time will visit only if I needed an unexpected shelter at that area..

Service was okayish...payment at the counter...

Went last week to get rescued from scorching heat ans gulp on some ice-creams....The location is great. The place is quite buzzy i must say. ¬†Apart from eating one gets to shop cookies, biscuits, puffs, patties, pastries etc. Ordered mango sundae which was literally yum! Virgin mojito was normal...i mean they served it differently in different tables. Some had mint stems others did not. Another thing which i found annyoing were the staffs. When u order only deserts and drinks they kind of wait and make you feel that u are doing some kind of crime by not ordering food. Food serving business should have positive approach and i guess one's gestures have a very important role to turn on the customers. Apart from that a cool place to chitchat.

I'm not too fond of patties but when it comes to Just Baked, their Chicken Patties is the best I've had till date. The patty layers are flaky and thin. Outside is crunchy and inside is soft. The chicken filling is not dry and really good.
However, recently I had taken home a chocolate cake which was suggested by one of the staffs there for my brother's birthday. The taste was highly disappointing given the standard of Just Baked's cakes are of.

You can either sit and eat or take away. Both the options are available in this bakery. I often visit this place while hungry and need to bribe my stomach with something quick and tasty. 
The chicken kebab roll and the paneer roll are my favourites. I don't like their pastries much. 
I recently got my mom a birthday cake on her birthday from here and it tasted really good.   The price was reasonable too. Rs . 295/- for 1lb.

I've visited this outlet once or twice to pick up a birthday cake. The cakes are quite fresh and tasty, but I found the prices at Just Baked to be a bit on the higher side. It could be just my opinion, but I've had the same quality of cakes from other cake shops as well, at much lower prices. Would love to visit again if the need arises, but will definitely think about the price before visiting.

My first experience at their esplanade outlet was next to horrible. This time it was a bit better.
I guess they make just a few good things ...and hence its not a place to experiment at all.
I stick to their apricot puff, hot coffee and cranberry iced tea.
The ambience is marred by a roaring AC.
The only saving grace was the large glass windows.
Over all ..... just average.
P.S THE VIRGIN MOJITO IS A SWEET DISASTER.

I love the idea of the bakery / shop cafe and the decor is very pretty, especially the glass wall. However there is scope for improving the quality and taste of the products. The mango frappe tastes quite artificial and the pastry is hard and chewy. Burger was ok but the croissants though were nicely mild and buttery. Brownie was good.

Located close to the Golpark Petrol Pump, the place did not look very spacious. Having another outlet of Just Baked close to where I live, I must confess that I have not been a big fan of them. Their quality has gone down over years, and I find no item lucrative, other than the muffins they make. The Chicken puff however tasted decent. Packed up two boxes of Muffins to have them back at home. There are varieties of freshly baked biscuits and cookies, which one can try over tea or coffee!

Just baked is one of favorite destination when it comes for budget confectionery items. They have kept their prices very competitive and serves you decent products as well.

This outlet of Just baked is located just on the lane starting from Golpark crossing to Purna Das road.

With a decent sized sitting arrangements this place is nice to be. I have been here quite a no. Of times and tried many of their items. I like the sandwich and the chicken afgani Pattie. Coffee is not so good very usual but their butter scotch and Vanilla cake is one my favorite from their offerings.

I have visited this outlet many a times. 
Spacious with clean seating arrangement. The sandwiches are good. The chicken puff tastes good when it is heated. The coffee is overly priced. The pastries are good.
The brownie with vanilla ice cream is good,which actually shocked me a bit. The nutty slice is caramelized and the base is crunchy. 
Overall a decent place to spend time.

This has been the pouring spot for me and my friends during the college days. The place serves some very nice confectionery products while being pleasantly easy on the pocket. 

My all time favorite pick is the egg chicken sandwich with a steaming cup of coffee. The place is more or less loosely packed during the mornings and hence provides you with enough scope to sit around and enjoy a long breakfast with friends or family. 

Other than the confectioneries, Just Baked is mostly famous for the wide array of biscuits and cookies it has to offer. Mine favorite are the Ginger and the Cardamom biscuits.  

One of the major issues with the place is that the food can be pretty late in arriving in the morning.

Good collection. Great location. Stuff behavior is ok. Decor is ok, space is a bit less. But given the location its good overall. Now about food, my son liked veg sandwich. We were having evening snacks. I took coffee only as I normally don't eat on weekend evening.
Coffee was good but slightly overpriced.
Ideologically I am against any place that don't offer regular water; but in this case I make an exception. That is ok. But real problem was not having a glass on the table.

It's more of a confectionery shop rather than cafe, Just Baked is operated by Bisk Farm and has a number of outlets in Kolkata. Just Baked is mostly known for their bakery and fast food products available. The Golpark branch is quite spacious with a few tables inside. Snacks are kept in the extreme right corner shelf of the store, however a disappointing thing is that there are no labels next to the snacks. Pastries and cakes are also available and kept in the freezer. Overall, the outlet is quite organized and finding stuff is easy.

Food, I mean snacks are the only thing I tried. Chicken Hot Dog was very basic, nothing special about it. The other thing, I tried was sort of Chicken Kebabs (forgot the name) but it was also descent. 

Ambiance is sort of okay, but when the store is full in the evening, it tends to get noisy. Good thing is that service is fast and no hiccups there. Pricing is standard, similar pricing to most modern bakery joints.

The sweetness along with a little bit of crunchiness of the walnut make it good. Overall the brownies are good but can be improved in quality.üòä‚ò∫

I love their chocolate pastries of various shapes and sizes, especially their chocolate mousse . And I love their ferro rocher cold beverage. Of late I have stopped going there because I regularly go their Hazra outlet.

Its located in the lane just  beside the Golpark petrol pump. Just baked is just not a confectionary shop but also a coffee shop. Biscuit, cakes and other food items nicely decorated. Staff are bit stiff. Food are fresh and good. but not the hot coffee.
  
Suggestion- You can pay by card only when the bill will be more than 250. Thats weird!

Just Baked is located at Golpark, just beside the petrol pump. I go to this place if I'm tired and wish to have some cold stuff. All I've tried here is: Strawberry Smoothie, Mango Frappe and Chocolate Frappe. Three of the drinks are good to taste and I alternatively pick from this list. Among all these Mango Frappe is my personal favourite. You can give it a shot. :)

Ever since my mom started visiting a nearby place for knitting, just baked has become one of our most visited places for some evening snacks.. The chicken pizza roll is brilliant, and to be quite fair, damn cheap.. The chicken Afgani patties and tikka masala patties is okayish.. Their kebab roll is also quite good.. The cream roll and apricot danish puff are a must try.. If you want to try something vegetarian, the Cheese corn roll is an absolute must.. I personally love the Palmier and the Chocolate pyramid..

While lazing in and around Golpark we‚Äôve had often dropped into this outlet; be it for a nice long chat or simply buying a pack of Just Ginger. It‚Äôs a clean and cozy place, ideal for spending time over food, coffee and gossip. They serve egg-less brownies after microwave heating it which makes the centre soft but it tastes a bit floury. Their pizza however comes with ajwain, making it taste a bit unusual. Most of their food items are pretty average barring one; the chocolate mousse. It is unlike in any other place in Kolkata of the same stature. A big edible bowl of chocolate containing a lot of creamy mousse and some nuts is nothing less than heaven in your mouth.  It can also easily satisfy two people. Another plus point is that they sell Mother Dairy ice creams which you can have right there, but only if you've ordered for something else too!

The two of us needed a place near Golpark to sit down and prepare some notes for an exam. From the corner we saw Just Baked peeping at us, and in we went.
The staff were cooperative and the seats were good enough for our studies. 

From the items on their menu, I met a few disappointments. The chicken sandwich which I ordered had a sour odour, and the chocochip pastry didn't taste fresh.

Specifically, I love the NUTTY CORNER, especially after they heat it so that the chocolate melts and the base becomes soft. @Just Baked, please make it a bit more chocolatey - it would be grand!

This is one of the cafes where I get a mixed experience everytime! :P

I have tasted almost all the available items starting from Chicken sandwich, chicken croissant,chicken tikka masala patties to cheese corn tart, butter croissant,pineapple danish puff, appricot danish puff etc.to butterscotch pastry, chocochip pastry,black forest pastry, nutty corner etc. I have also tried hot and cold beverages like cold n hot coffee, strawberry smoothie,chocolate frapp√©,cranberry iced tea,virgin pinacolada. I loved almost all of them except walnut brownie which i found out to be very hard. It's a good joint n pocket friendly too.

Just baked is my place to get nice and soft black forest pastries. I don't like the fact that they have hiked the price so much but well i cannot help myself but dig into one !
:D

This particular store is situated in a very very good location. They stock a good amount of their packed products. that is the biscuits etc. Plenty of cakes are also available and I like that they have a lot of snacks as well.
But mostly i like that the staff of this outlet is very attentive, not like the others i have been to.
The food quality is very good. And they serve quickly. They have quite a number of tables for you to sit down and enjoy your coffee with a slice of cake ;)

One of the finest pastries and cake eating places in the city. They have seating arrangements also, with several snacks and drinks to offer. The black forest is just heavenly. The non-veg or veg snacks is good also, but very few items are actually present in the store, as to the list given. You must try a birthday cake from here sometime. And don't forget to grab a couple of biscuit or cake packets before you leave.

i was hell hungry and dint want to have spicy food and at the same time had to satisfy my hunger for food..so me and Ak decided to hit just baked ..its a spacious outlet here at hindustan park just beside the petrol pump..i loved the ambience here ..there were young couple..even old people come here for having sandwiches and cuppa coffee or tea..

we ordered for a cheese chicken roll,a chicken burger,chicken sandwiches and cold coffees ..i must say the cheese chicken roll may look hard crust but its so soft that ot melts in the mouth and i just loved it..i am fan of their cold chicken sandwiches i mainly go here for this..what surprised me was the burger it has a chicken filling which was awesomely tasty..and the cold coffees were too creamy and tasty..i really love the food here as it comes with variety and great taste..

service was fast and the management was very cordial..in totality had the exact food in this heat of 40 degrees here, which could satisfy my hunger ...and loved it!

While going off to attend classes at RKM, I sometimes drop by this outlet to have a little chit chat with my friends. Located just at the Golpark crossing, this outlet enjoys its superb locational advantages.

I recently visited the place with two of my friends in the evening and ended up ordering 2 chicken quiche, 1 nutty corner,1 chocolate crunch pastry and a cup of cappuccino. The stuffing of the quiche was good with the egg, chicken and the onions, but the coating could have been better. It was more on the oily side. The pastries were good, nothing extra-ordinary though the nutty corner ranked better. The coffee was good, if not great, product of an instant coffee mixer .It came in with a beautiful leaf done on top with the froth.

I always though there are just two tables here (just the ones we get to see from road) but I was wrong. There are 4-5 tables inside. The ac inside, which was right above our head was not working properly so the server sweetly agreed when we wanted to change our seats to the other ac corner.

We ordered egg chicken sandwiches, chocolate walnut brownie and cold coffee mix. The sandwiches came first. Here I must mention, I am not a big fan of sandwich but these sandwiches were quite nice. The chicken was nicely done and you can always see and feel the slices of the boiled egg. Not bad, but I just wish they had a little more of cheese and mayonnaise. Now, I have always found all the coffee-s in the world bitter. The cold coffee that I tasted here was a lil less. A loved the cold coffee though.

The walnut brownie took my heart away. I LOVE brownies. The brownies of Just Baked have just the perfect softness and right proportions of chocolate sauce. You will taste the dry fruits, a major chunk of which is almond here, even at your last bite. Though little too small in size, but the brownies totally made my evening!

Although they served the coffee a little late but the people here are extremely sweet. They would very sweetly nod at all that you have to say. You can spend hours here chit chatting and nobody would mind. The sweet dishes are slightly better than the others. Oh! You also get mother diary ice creams here :)

I should have been wary as soon as the first bite of the vegetable sandwich I bought myself from Just Baked filled my mouth with a bitter taste..but I went all the way and ingested it..and then celebrated the next sunrise as "Food Poisoning Day".

Nice place, nice location. And you get a decent cup of coffee at reasonable price. The coffee is served with a couple of biscuits which are really tasty.

It is a very small place but the service is really good. Fast and friendly. The baked bites that you get here are fresh and goes nicely with the coffee (I don't like their sandwiches). I would specially mention the chicken quiche, which is melt in the mouth tasty.

What helps this particular outlet is its superb location - right on the posh Southern Avenue, and whenever I am near the area, I end up spending some time sipping coffee or munching through some of the delicacies served there. It's a small outlet and hardly accomodates 10 people at one go, but its good enough for a cup of coffee!

My cousin and I come here often for a chat or to catch up with each other over hot cups of coffee, which is served with two of their biscuits, something I like. The coffee, unlike many other places, is not bland, and although I know it probably comes from an instant coffee mix, it is still better than the swill presented by many other so-called great coffee joints. 

Besides the coffee, I love their butter cake slice and apricot danish puff, two of the staples I order. Plus, they have a good array of biscuits and other confections, which I take away too. What I like is the fact that they do not seem to mind if you sit and linger about your coffee, and the service is fast.
