Now, with those big roadside food joints in Karunamoyee Bus stand gone, this tiny outlet serves and fulfill our cravings for biryanis and rolls. Absolutely budget friendly and the food served here is quite delicious. Biryani and kebab rolls are worth mentioning. One portion of each can extinguish the appetite of anyone in the most pleasant manner. The taste and the pricing is compelling me to visit this joint again and again for street side mughlai cuisines.

Food is great considering the price. Food tastes great and quantity too is good. Service is prompt considering the demand. In case you are in a mood of Mughlai but have an almost empty pocket, this is a place for you to have a full filling meal.

I had ordered food from Saima through Zomato.I must say that the delivery was prompt and I got warm food at my doorstep. As for the Chicken Biriyani its a steal for Rs.120 where they give an egg with good quantity of rice, a big piece of chicken and aloo. It was well cooked and quite tasty. We had also ordered Chicken tandoori which was simply pathetic. The pieces looked dry and had an unhealthy looking red colour, there was also an overpowering taste of cinamon with no proper tandoor flavour or taste..
But the biriyani is their speciality and it is worth a try...üòÅüòÅüòÅ

Sitting is not very comfortable as there is no shed. The cost of the food is quite reasonable. If u r finding good Briyani at lower price, u must try here. Also the items such as chicken Kassa, chicken Kalia, chicken curry having 1 piece is sufficient for one person but they all taste the same. For home delivery, they take ‚Çπ15 extra as delivery charge.

Yessss it was that cheap.
Rice quality is not that good but with this price you cant ask anything more.. Mutton kalia was good though a bit oily but it is eatable .. Dal fry was more than ok-ok type.. 
it could be a choice for saltlake IT/bpo employees to survive at the end of the month if you are out of budget or your friends asking for a treat :p

Saima Restaurant is another street food counter mainly famous for delivering North Indian foods from office to office in Sec V. Ordered their Biryani & Chap one day for lunch in office & I totally understood the reason of their poor rating.

Mutton Biryani : Biryani looked very rich but not well mixed. The portion of the Biryani was huge. Rice quality felt very low. Mixed spices was very rich but that didn't increases the taste of it. The heart of a plate of Biryani, the piece of potato didn't felt well. Mutton piece was smelling badly that ruined the taste of Biryani. The Mutton piece wasn't well cooked neither it was fresh. Basically the Biryani wasn't satisfactory in quality but quantity wise it can fill an empty stomach well.

Chicken Chap : Chicken Chap looked very rich on the first sight, floting a thick layer of dark oil on it. The gravy was extremely rich with a ton of spices mixed with it. Unfortunately the gravy didn't tasted good with the Biryani. Chicken piece on the other hand was big but no way it was fresh. It was little hard, not well cooked & the rich spices made its taste compleatly dull. Excessive spices in this dish didn't worth it.

Some of the office crowd of Sec V uses to order food from here because of their cheap prices & office delivery options. But if talking about food, their foods is strictly no for me because of very poor quality.

Disappointing. I ordered mixed vegetables and got pieces of potato and cauliflower in a watery gravy. Ordered paneer butter masala and got a few tiny pieces of paneer that were not visible on the surface of a thick curry that looked rather daunting, and had to be fished out with a spoon.¬† Ordered veg tarkha and all I got by way of veg were two or three pieces of tomato. On the upside, the lachha paratha and tarkha (though not what I wanted) tasted fine.

Tasted ok to average when tried with colleagues. Hence ordered for home delivery the very next day. Biriyani was stale, biriyani rice were breaking ( must be cooked long ago) and chicken with a first bite gave a rotten smell, chicken flesh was easily coming out from the bones marking it as very old as well. We immediately called up to inform however they neither did accept nor deny and were pretty worried how to avoid further conversation. They were not ill mannered but were scared. We threw it for that day. After a few days while passing by the Saima shop, for some other work, the single glimpse of the restaurant made us feel sick. Unhygenic is the word. With streets dogs roaming around their half cooked boiled rice being kept near uncovered drain. Well since they can make an average tasting biriyani and people do actually like it, if they are serious they really need to look after all these loopholes. They can do wonders with a proper hygenic environment.

I have been in Kolkata for the last 1 year and during my tenure over here I hardly liked the Biryani of Kolkata,
I have had Biryani from various places like Hazi Ali, Arsalan, Shiraz Golden Restaurant and Aminia, but they couldn't change my mind.¬†

Few week back I came across this Place in Zomato and I found it particularly very cheap and I thought, lets try Biryani for the last time and I wasn't expecting much as the price was very less as compared to the other places. That was the first day when I ordered Egg Biryani and I liked it so much that I continued to order Chicken Biryani, Veg Biryani, Plain Biryani etc ¬†from them for the next 3 - 4 days. ¬† Now what turned me on is the taste off course and also the Biryani was very less oily and that took me as a surprise. ¬†

I haven't been to this place yet, but would like to visit the coming weekend and try something new instead of Biryani and to be honest I don't mind having Biryani as well. :-)
            

The Rating of 4.5 is just because they changed my thinking about how Kolkata's biryani taste like.

Ordered special mutton biryani from here today to celebrate eid

I would like to say ,i am not dissapointed , the taste is simply superb and oh so delicious, with reasonable good size of mutton and biryani alu and taste which can compete with arsalan and amenia

Its quite a catch, i agree its a bit high on the spice and oil quotient but so is the ever famous biryani from Arsalan, if someone wants a light biryani , then this place is not for such weak hearts .

Also ordered some firni which is absolutely mindblowing , only caution about this place , the delivery takes a bit too long , so one needs to have a lot of patience, but hey as they say great things take time .

Cant review about other dishes , but a total thumbsup for the biryani and firni

Looking forward to order more delicious food from here

I was famished and Zomato was a helpful in getting me an economical restaurant.

The quantity of the food was great for both of us (me and my roommate). However, the Chicken was bit high on the saltier side ;(. Please take care for the amount of spices you put on the food.

The packaging and the color and the odor of the food was decent.

Overall, Satisfied!.

Hey Guys

If you ¬†have not tried out this joint then please do same if not for anything but for ¬†the NEW ROLLS on their menu i.e MUTTON SHAAMI ROLL, EGG MUTTON SHAAMI ROLL. I am sure the kolkata roll lovers are going to love it .More ever the the rolls ¬†are just costing you Rs 40 & Rs 35 (Believe me its a deal).This is my roll joint as because they have always availaible stock of chilled COKE to go with it.
The best part of their any roll is the parantha is that it will not harden up even after keeping it for 3/4 hours.

This eatery has 2 branches - one right next to the no.12 tank near GD market and the other outlet situated next to FE park. They are basically takeaway and snack joints catering to the needs of the nearby blocks.
     Coming to the food their rolls are good but the other items are not up to the mark. The mutton korma & chicken kosha both need improvement but their chicken bharta was standard fare. Their lachha parantha is also one to try. Its a very pocket friendly place as the dishes are all relatively priced near Rs.100

I love their chicken rolls.. they are not thrifty when it comes to the size or the pieces. And their chicken seikh kebab..20 pieces yay!!!¬†
They are pocket friendly., so go easy on them. Remeber, if you are hungry, they will serve your purpose.
