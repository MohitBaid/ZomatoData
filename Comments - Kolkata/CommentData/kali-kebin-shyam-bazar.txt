It is located at Shyambazar, selling mainly fast foods.

Ambience is shabby and untidy  with little  sitting arrangements.

Service is quick.

Tried fried rice & Chiili chicken. Both tasted average and bland and was totally unhealthy.

Pocket pinch is cheap.

Not recommended.

Nothing to write. Average & low budget eating place. Thought the fish would be okay but that to turned out low in taste meter. Single variety of fish curry. No option. Fixed menu. Less than 10  things to choose from.

After a long day of pandal hopping we reached Shyambazar, where we decided to go to a restaurant for dinner. Such long queue in front of famous restaurants like Gol Ghor, Mitra Cafe forced us to visit Kali Cabin. There is nothing personal against this place but there should be a standard quality of foods you are being served. We had to sit outside the restaurant as seats were not available plus fried rice tasted like boiled rice with pieces of carrots ands beans scattered here and there. The chilly chicken was like chicken balls dipped in ketchup. Had a very bad experience, my friends will agree to it too. Needs to improve a lot.

We were very tired after hopping pandals for 5-6 hours. We found kali kebin near shyambazar. We tried fried rice and chilli chicken. Fried rice was worst. That was not other than boiled rice. Chilli chicken was also bad but eatable. The worst restro I have ever been.
