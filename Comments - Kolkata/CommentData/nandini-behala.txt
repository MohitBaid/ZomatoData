Went there for some quick bite this month for the 1st time. The food that this small joint serves tastes okay but the waiters are very disturbing as they keep roaming around you all the time without reason. Behala certainly have better food joints which serve better quality food at cheaper price when it comes to some casual eating out. And this place is not meant for any fine dining.

If you are very hungry and go for anything then go there. Even still you will get much tasty food nearby at a much cheaper price. Very shabby and crampy interior. Also, mind your head in the sitting area on first floor, otherwise may sustain head injury.

Its is a nice place for having quick bites.The ambience was good and the taste of the food was average and the staffs are also cooperative but the price is too high.

When it was a small snack bar I was a regular customer here. After the 'big' evolution they had, things never went same, at least with me. Last Puja had a plate of Biryani so bland that I have to just leave less than half on the table. Only saving grace is their rolls otherwise the whole show is running flop. Surprisingly I had Biryani from the specialist restaurants which cost way less than what Nandini asks for. i don't know why they are charging high.  Disappointed.

We frequently order in from Nandini and also have visited the restaurant. It is a modest little place and not too comfortable. The food quality varies each time we order. We've risked ordering Biryani from there twice and weren't disappointed. It was quite delightful as the quality and quantity gave the popular  better known Biryani joints a run for their money!  The Chinese cuisine could however make do with a great deal of improvement.

It's an overpriced restaurant. Nothing except their rolls is worth having again. I tried Chinese chop suey and it was sweet. I would not recommend this to anybody.

I have never been to this restaurant so i dont know its exact location or tge kind of service it provides. I have always ordered from here either through foodpanda or by directly calling them. Coming to food its average. Biryani is good. Pocket pinch is average. So u can give it a try if u stay somewhere near behala and u are low on cash.
