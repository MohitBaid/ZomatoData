Located just opposite RDB Boulevard, this sports themed lounge is a great place to hang out with Friends. The Food is average, Service is prompt and the Staff is friendly. Pocket Pinch is reasonable. Definitely, worth a try! :)

COZY PLACE TO HANGOUT AFTER OFFICE WITH OFFICE BUDDIES FOR A DRINK OR TWO. THE ATMOSPHERE REJUVINATES YOU UP AND HELPS YOU RELAX AND REDUCES YOUR STRESS. THE STAFF ARE QUIET FRIENDLY AND DRINK VARIETY AND ACCOMPANIMENTS ARE ALSO QUIET COMMENDABLE. ALL THE BEST GUYS.

Great place to chill.Being a bar stock exchange it has done pretty good job on the decor th abar is really widespread and nicely decorated with all the LED lights which looks very fluorescent and decks it up quite well.It has a nice small dance floor but you won't like to dance in these places being the reason it's a BSA.So coming to main aspects the food wasn't that bad ..we tried very generic dishes like hakka chicken dry chilly fish and chicken manchurian which was descentlt okay.T leg draught beer took forever to come though it was descently prized.The prices didn't much go down when we went anyways we had descent experience.

Nice ambience for sports lovers. Live streaming of matches that makes even a non sports lover indulge into watching the same.
Food- love the chilli garlic noodles here. 
Nice range of mocktails, specially a berries one (can‚Äôt remember the name)
Overall it was a great experience!

Went there to watch the El-Clasico (didn't proved to be fruitful for my team though) yesterday..
Came to know at the entry of this lounge, that stag entry isn't allowed though there was no info regarding that, neither in zomato nor when we called the manager earlier! üëé
Then, we had to pay 'caution money' to get entry, which they informed would be adjusted from our final bill..
Giant screen in here is alright.. Though most of the drinks we asked for couldn't be served because of non-supply.. Corona was the only beer they had.. So we were forced to take it.. Food and hookah was OK.. Pocket pinch of this place is on the high side though the overall experience was nothing extraordinary!

So I had gone there with my friend on a Sunday night.. To my surprise the club was empty on a Sunday too! Music was amazing and the ambiance nice! We ordered a Hookah, Mojito and Pasta! Hookah was average, Mojito was nice and the Garlic bread with Mixed sauce pasta was over grilled! Service is average.. The music and ambiance does magic for me here!

My suggestion would be to keep atleast 5-6 kind of beer...
Pocket pinch was 1299 which was ok...

The food they served are really delicious.. and price of the liquor is almost quit reasonable.. so as a whole.. it's a good place to hang out..

It was the first time that i was about to visit a sports lounge,and the moment i stepped in,my expectations rose from this place,the decor is amazing,the seating arrangement was very comfortable,the hookah we ordered was a paanch paan,it was supposed to be strong,but it was very light,we even ordered kebabs,but the time period between ordering and getting the actual food,it was very late ,they should look into this and make sure it doesnt happen again.
the quality of the food was okay.

Pocket pinch - A hookah + beer + a side dish will approximately cost you around 900 bucks.

Located at a very convenience place in sector 5. One sports lounge gave me a good experience.
The ambience was sober. Giving it a 4/5.
The staff was very slow. I literally had to shout to call out to the staff. However, they were friendly.
I had ordered a tandoori platter which was good. Mushroom could have been more. 
A pizza which was nothing very great, just simple veggie pizza.
A Chinese platter who's quantity I felt was very poor.
The hookah was good, smooth.
Pocket pinch was fair. If you take combos and platters, it's pocket friendly.

The ambience of this place is great perfect if you want to enjoy loud music and dim lights. Liked the place in respect to this.

But coming to food and staff. Staff here doesn't even bothers to take your order or what you are up to. I went here on my birthday, my friend asked them to arrange a small cake which they were unable to. Again, she asked them to bring brownie n just decorate it with icing as they had brownie in there menu, they failed to do so even. Ultimately, we left the restaurant n went to another. Not a very good experience.

Located just opposite to RDB Boulevard is this place, shortly also known as OSL. Tried the hookah (gum kiwi), pizza with smoked chicken, sangria with red wine, LIIT and draught beer. Please check out for the offers as they have different offers sometimes, but they are worth trying. The pizza was good, sangria was okay and LIIT was good. The ambience was not too good or bad. It was just fine. The bar counter is well decorated and the customer service is good. It can be good place to give parties and that was clear from the environment. The hookah was not that good.

Their hookah is pretty but the food is decent. I usually have food from TFT (That Food Truck, nearby) and hookkah from here. Also, the music that they play is not so great. They need to work on their playlist. The bar stock exchange concept in Sector 5 is an attractive offering though.

Another decent bar at Sector V.
Good happy hour deals but the frustrating thing is that they do not provide complimentary with happy hour booze, you have to order from the regular menu to get complimentary.
Food is decent, Tai Pai fish was delicious.
A good variety of sisha is also available.
Good service and good ambience with comfortable sitting arrangements.
Being a sports bar they have a good number of LED TVs for broadcasting all the sports channel.
Worth a visit and might also turn into your regular bar.

It was navami and we were thinking to hit a lounge bar. There was a tall guy with moustaches wearing a hat standing outside this bar, asked us to pay 500 bucks per person for entry and which was redeemable. We 10 people hoped there and thought to enjoy the night.
Generally I don't give a restaurant/bar one star, if I'm giving this there is something bad in it. Now pointing the good things they done to us.

1) We entered the lounge bar and they cannot give us a seat, after standing one hour, we managed our seats by ourselves.
2) I asked for kingfisher premium pint beer, one with a black shirt (red highlighted hair) told me, they have finished this beer and we have to take ultra max. Suddenly after 1hr they were serving kingfisher premium to one my friend only. Pathetic!
3) Food was good, so I have given one star, but the services were worst. We have ever seen this type of hospitality in a lounge bar in our whole life.
4) They served tequila, but there was no smell and taste of tequila. I don't know what the hell happened to them.
5) Lastly, the bill came around rs. 8950 and before paying we told to redeem our entry fee as said by them. That tall guy with moustache came drunk and shouted at us unknowingly, told " I am the owner, if you don't give us money, I will call the cops". We even told politely we were not going anywhere, you told us that was redeemable so we told to redeem that 5k (for 10 people) and one my friend was also swiping his card. And last but not the least you were pointing your finger on a girl.

Seriously, if you are behaving like this, when you are into this business, you all are going wrong. I don't know about others but you people lost 10 valued customers and you should apologize‚Äã for this behaviour. Sick of your manners.

P.S.- Not recommended at all. Go at your own risk and expect worst hospitality and a cheap kind of behaviour from their manager.

Ambience - from outside before entering 3/5

Behaviour-0/5 

The owner of this place doesn't even know how to behave in a human way. I have seen them to misbehave with everyone as they were dead drunken.

Not at all a place to visit.

Then they should write it in capital letters in the main gate only that no hookah to be served if there is no order for liqour in the table. Worst place ever went. Even the staff dont know how to attend customers

Once in a while when you bevome a party animal and you want to unleash it, one sports lounge is the place. A cozy smooth pub where you can hang around as couple or group, one sports provide you with all the amenities. Small cubes are arranged for the couples at first level along with single bar stools near bartender for individuals. Lounge for large groups and an isolated room for people who want the silent ambience. Variety of cocktails at reasonable price with a stock of hoegaarden beers add to the stock. Hookah is available at different flavours which allow you to explore. Surround sound system hits you on the beat and make your feet dance to them. Though can't comment on food as we had only drinks and hookah.

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. So we randomly ended up here as we wanted to have some sheesha around 6pm and surprisingly we had a great time. Didn't have much just fries, sheesha and a few pints.

Ambiance and theme is kind of like bar stock exchange, live match going on the big screen, dim lights just the way I like it.

Weird thing is that the waiter won't talk to you as you are a girl, this is something that I noticed so I asked him if you have Bira available and he told to the 'guy' with us that it's not there and thn my friend told me and thn I asked if you have Budweiser again he did the same thing but this time the Anwer was yes. I don't know what his deal was but I didn't really like that. So do take a 'guy' along if you visit one sports lounge.

Photos without flash, sorry guys my bad.

Hearing a lot about brunch combos at an unbelievable cheap price we headed towards One sports lounge on a Friday afternoon. They have separate place for hookah, thumbs up for that. But they turned us off as they said beer was unavailable. We ordered nonveg Chinese combo and nonveg pizza combo. The quantity was ample and quality was impressive. We specifically liked the chicken wings. The peri peri pizza was thin crust and a bit too hard. Another good thing to mention, we loved their decor. Definitely gonna come back when they have varieties of drinks to serve us.

It's located in infinity benchmark opposite of RBD Cinemas. It's the perfect party oriented and chill out restaurant with loud music, dance floor and live sports screening. Mexican and Italian food are better than Indian n Chinese. There is a particular inside the restaurant which is little wired because in both the subparts they are serving the same. One amongst the subpart, either there is no staff or they are standing on your head because the space is too small. And on the other part, the area is so large and music is so loud that u have to call the staff several times. Also many times the chef was coming and giving the food to the staffs. I think they should rearrange the sitting and increase the staffs. Otherwise it's a nice restaurant to chill out n  have hookahs n drinks with friends.

And on the other part, the area is so large and music is so loud that u have to call the staff several times. Also many times the chef was coming and giving the food to the staffs. I think they should rearrange the sitting and increase the staffs. Otherwise it's a nice restaurant to chill out n  have hookahs n drinks with friends.

I was going here maybe for the 4th or 5th time and was very excited as always..N i ordered noodles and Manchurian.. well the food came very late atleast 25-30 mins..And the Manchurian was horriable.. when I asked them to take it back they told me that we will change it even though I was almost done with the noodles..they insisted me to pay for the Manchurian which was so wrong..the music is very loud..other than that the food was ok.

The place was dark and upbeat with thumping music as we entered. I had gone for the popular cocktails of the place. But gin wasn't available so I didn't have much choice. We had draught beer and snacks. I think it's so-so.

One sports lounge is located in the heart of sector 5 on the ground floor of infinity benchmark right opposite to RDB Boulevard.This is a sports themed lounge with live screening, a concept which is relatively new in Kolkata.

The ambience and the lighting of the lounge compliment each other.  The  staff is polite and the service is great. The menu is simple but innovative. The dishes in this restaurant are absolutely ecstatic which include Spaghetti, Peri Peri pizza, Murg Malai kebab, Bullet Seekh Kebab and Chef‚Äôs special Chicken Biryani (which is Biryani rice stuffed inside a whole roasted chicken). The bar serves a wide array of liquor , cocktails and mocktails , the classics as well as amazing inventions  by the bartender. Shisha is available in lots of flavours and are decently priced.

This place is great for sports enthusiasts and friendly hangouts. It is fairly popular and is fully packed during the weekends. It is difficult to get a seat during live sports screenings and reservation is recommended. Over all Great quality and scrumptious food with beautiful ambience with a very decent pocket pinch, this place is great to party with friends.

I visited this place last night on a Friday evening and wasn't disappointed to be honest. The alcohol is pretty pocket friendly and the music played was pretty much contemporary with occasional mentions of yesteryear numbers. Quite nicely done are the interiors . Bartenders are warm and welcoming. Had 6 pegs of 100 pipers and Thai fried chicken. The quantity of the chicken I would say was very less although was tasty. If you got whiskey on your mind this is the place to be. üçª cheers

It was a disappointing entry since we were informed by the staff that they were booked from 7 pm and we would have to leave by 6.30. Well, it kind of becomes a hassle to sit down and start having fun and then having to leave the place. Seemed like the place wanted to make a quick buck before getting ready for the evening. We were a group of ten and with balloons being put up around us, we weren‚Äôt complaining. Keeping the time limit in mind, we ordered starters comprising of babycorn and dry chili chicken along with our individual drinks (they work like a stock exchange, but when its not too crowded, it gets confusing ordering the drinks). The food was standard as was the service. If it wasn‚Äôt for the service,¬† I don‚Äôt think we would be here at all. Won‚Äôt really want to go back anytime soon.

Well, some positive word-of-the-mouth and I could not hold back myself from visiting this place!

A sports themed caf√© ‚Äì pretty much a newbie in the hustles of Sector 5, conveniently based nearby the RDB Cinemas! Someone opined about their great food and I stormed into this place to taste their offerings!

The catalogue prices might seem exquisite, but they do offer combo meals to attract more office-goers! I opted for their Veg Chinese combo meal ‚Äì priced at Rs. 209 /- (A.I.).

Ambience is pretty much great ‚Äì as you find in a typical caf√© ‚Äì what does catch your attention is the SENSEX-styled prices of hard drinks displayed ‚Äì do visit them to see it! They do have separate seating arrangements for hookah and non-hookah clients to increase convenience!

The Chinese combo comprised:-

(i)	Crispy babycorn:- Quite crispy and tasty

(ii)	Veg fried rice:- Great presentation ‚Äì decently chopped vegetables -  fine on taste

(iii)	3 pieces of Manchurian ‚Äì they call it the veg coins in hot garlic sauce ‚Äì this was pretty ordinary although, gravy was very tasty!

Service is fine, they seat you at the sofas designed with newspaper cover. Since the IPL fever is on, they do have some IPL-theme decoration as well. Size of the place is huge and overall, a great place to hang-out ‚Äì RECOMMENDED!

Nothing to brag about! In an area that has multiple options, you must be price-sensitive or must be serving something which is unique or great when it comes to quality. But neither anything is special at this bar, and on top of that it's over-priced. I wish them all the best for the future!

This is not a lounge in any way. It is a bar stock exchange with loud music in background. the ambiance is nowhere near to a lounge. For some unknown reason the exchange was not open and we were not sure about the prices of the drinks. The drinks menu does not have any price on the list. You have to ask the waiter for the price of each drink. The drinks are overpriced for no reason.¬†
The food is average. The hookah is also good. The service is poor. The waiter cannot hear you or pay any attention for the customer.

Sadly Pubs would never take Zomato or the customers seriously. Where as MMT or Goibibo plays much important role to make sure that the guests are treated in the right way. Noone would bother about the reviews when it comes to PUBs.

One negative thing was sofas were good but the chairs with the tables weren't very comfortable to sit for long. Alongwith drinks, we had ordered Tai Pai Fish which was tasty but the Murg tikka wasn't that good. Overall a nice experience. :)

Located just at the heart of office hubs, this sports lounge is one of the regular hopping places for office goers like us. The place has a pretty cool ambience, pretty decently priced and friendly waiters. The food is pretty good as well, though we mostly take starters that go with the drinks well. But yeah, the kebabs are pretty well cooked. But the main thing the drinks, a bit high on the pocket, but not really that upto the mark, especially the cocktails. Overall an okayish place to hang out after office.

I went to this place a couple of months back out of curiosity. First on a Thursday they told ua that they will not serve alcohol which was a huge let down. So before you enter you need to make sure whether they will serve or not with the security otherwise it will resuly in an embarrassing situation.
On a different day day however I didn't face such a problem. The food is kinda ok, nothing special. Quantity wise its not that great though. However the biggest problem with this place is they won't give you normal water and you have to buy a Rs. 10 bottle for a whooping Rs. 35 which is absolutely ridiculous.
Ambience wise its pretty good with live matches and music going on.

Though the decor was nicely done

I really wish people took more care employing good cooks n improving the taste of the food rather than spending all their efforts on the decor of the restaurant

One sports lounge is located in the It sector of Kolkata. It is located bang opposite Rdb Boulevard.
This relatively new kid in the house was a surprise.
One sports lounge has two seating arenas one where you can enjoy a loud music and one where you can sit  in peace with your loved ones with out the music.
They generally play bollywood and punjabi songs to pump up the atmosphere.
The place has comfortable couches and amiable waiters. The concept of the bar stock exchange has been implemented here which is a good deal.

Nice place to hangout with friends. There are two sections in the place. One is a music section and the other is a non-music one. Good concept, must say!!! Was lucky to have a server like Irfan who was really helpful and suggested really nice dishes. Ordered a Murg Malai Kebab and Cheesy Grilled Breast Chicken. For drinks had a Bira beer and a Kulfi Shake. The chicken items were really nice with the meat being soft and cooked to perfection. Overall, a really decent place to chill!!!

I usually do not start a review with negative comments. Here the music was extremely loud. You'll ask me how does that makes a difference? Well it did, since the music was being changed frequently. You'd say again, that's how it should be. What I mean to say is that, the music was changed in such a manner which made no sense and it felt as if the DJ( i hope he was one) did not have a clue about which songs to play. It changed abruptly and it was not pleasant at all.
Also it says here dance floor, right? Misleading. They did not allow us to dance. I have no idea why though. Food was okayish, nothing awesome. Beer was cool.

Not going back again. Sorry.

Nice concept of bar stock exchange, the first of its kind in Kolkata. But too over priced. I mean too much. Sometimes the beers are 250% more costly than MRP. Food tastes good but again very highly priced. Lack of space. Tables are arranged in a congested order.

Honestly speaking, we were passing by this place one fine afternoon when their attractive happy hours offer caught our attention. We decided to give this place a try.

The vibrant ambiance, the rather loud music and the giant screen set up a nice backdrop for a cocktail or two (or three!).  The cocktails were pretty decent too. The LIIT was well made. Strong and impressive. The Mojito was refreshing.

But then that's where most of the good things about this place kind of ends.

We at Hungry Hallows are on a pizza trail looking out for Kolkata's top 10 pizzas and hence decided to try their pizza. We ordered the Lamb pizza which was supposed to have broccoli, olives and asparagus with roasted cumin flavoured lamb. It was an interesting combination which we were rather skeptical about ordering but ordered nonetheless out of curiosity. When the pizza finally arrived, our apprehensions turned out to be correct. The pizza was weird and plain simple bad. 

To make matters worse, we had asked for a glass of water and the waiters blatantly refused saying that they do not serve plain water. This we found pretty cheap and rather unacceptable. 

Overall yes this place has a nice happy hours offer and decent cocktails. But the food was bad and the service disappointing.¬†
Not one place we would be going back to anytime soon.

The food and the service has been good but the place is too noisy. If you want a place where you can sit peacefully and chat with your friends, I wouldn't recommend this place. But if the sports screening, the noise from the table beside you doesn't bother you much, you can definitely give a try. The interiors have been done well.

The place and ambience was fine. However it wasn't upto the mark as per its surrounding restuarants and hype. The hookah options were limited and not too great with a bit smoke restriction and flavour wasn't being Fletcher untill coal change, which is wrong. The food in starter was good. However the main course was a bit raw and cold and chicken dishes not cooked properly. 

In terms of music, the dj was good. However again the music system bass was sad 80% of the time and quality in higher pitches was a bit hazy. 

Their system of bar stock was a good idea. They need to capitalise on that. Cocktails were good but not too great.

Stationed next to 10Downing Street this place runs some amazing offers even during the weekend! 

We ordered three starters and almost 10 different drinks coupled with a hookah and we were billed for something around INR 2000 which was comparatively much less than other lounge/pubs. 
Having IndvsEng ODI on that day was icing on the cake. 
The place serves good food, rolls nice offers and has a comfortable ambience too. 
Service was good too.

Located at a very prime office location in Calcutta, Sector 5 (Opposite side of the RDB Complex), One Sports Lounge is nice place to unwind after work. The ambience is nothing too fancy but like any other sports lounge. The choice of music, cordial staff, quality of food, mixing of cocktails and hookah are all winners! Special mention would be for LIT and Mojito which were very well mixed. The pizza was absolutely yumm! On the shakes end, their Kit Kat shake was good. Overall a good experience!

The one thing good about the place is the decor,period. Kolkata has been longing for a sports bar for ages,I had strong expectations for this place but was disappointed like always! It's a sports bar. It would be appreciated if they kept it that way! They've been trying to put everything at one place, a bar stock exchange, live band , live sports screening but fail at each. It seems to be a dumb idea when 70% of your audience is interested in a high profile match and then there is a live band playing. Thus, keeping the sports enthusiast inside of me still unsatisfied.
Now,the food I only had the chance to try the chicken wings which seemed undercooked. The hookah was midocre. The service and staff weren't responsive either. Bad experience,there is still time and room to improve!

A very well nice and tidy place with a very good ambience. Even the idea of bar as a stock exchange is very exciting and new as well. Now comes the quality of the place while rating this place. To be true there is no difference between this place and any other lounge bar. Like nothing is special. Like as I entered I felt very good and was in a thought like I will be getting something extra ordinary but then again it was all the same except for the bar stock exchange. Even the quality of the food I took like the stuffed chicken breasts and the lazania was not atall what I thought it to be. Even the cocktails we ordered was not special.
I asked in the very beginning for the special item of the day but the waiter couldn't help. 
Yeah, in short a nice place you can visit but then again for one time only.

This is one of the restaurant cum bar cum hookah lounges located on the ground floor of the infinity building opposite rdb...as the name suggests, the decor comprises of the framed pictures of the reputed sports persons..they have 4 tvs in the bar area showing different sports channels and 1 large projector screen playing bollywood and other music..so u can just hop in there wid ur girl on a match day and watch ur game while she enjoys the music...the seating area is somewhat average,but the place is tidy and well maintained..As far as the food is concerned, we had ordered one of their signature dishes 'paneer jalwa' and a peach flavoured hookah.
well,i have no complaints about the hookah..it was really good...as far as the paneer is concerned,it did not live upto our expectations and tasted monotonous....the paneer could have been fried a bit more..the description had a mention of cheese inside which we could not spot even in a single bite..anyways it was okayish....however the service needs to improve and staffs need grooming..specially on how to respond to customer's queries...on the economic end,i would say it is quite a pricey place... however i enjoyed the evening there and would definitely recommend this place as this is one where you can really go to and spend a great time with your inner circle..

Good hookah and starters will entertain your taste buds. Ask for the long filter, they r so much fun.
Alcohol is not available everyday, we ended up twice on dry days for the pub. We ordered prawn skewer and paneer tandoor. The presentation was as good as the taste. The prawn cud have been a bit more softer but the crispy outer coating made up for it. The paneer was delicious, only three round pieces, along side mashed potatoes and sauted exotic veggies. 
Then came the crispy chilly baby corn, which was a soar disappointment. In taste and texture. Go for the special things in the menu, they make it better. The garlic stir fried hakka noodles was too spicy so a spicy sign shud be indicated in the menu. It was fairly alright.

Located bang opposite RDB Cinema in Sector V, Salt Lake.

You enter through a corridor of neon red light and that for me was the main punch of this lounge cum cafe dedicated to sports.

Comfortable sofas and seats with a ultra modern neon light slick decor. Although dedicated to sports, the decor doesn't show up much of sports except for the TVs which show only sports channels.

But it surely is a very stylish place to be in.

Coming to the food, I had ordered a choco jane shake which is one of the best shakes I have had off late.
Fish Irani kebab which was recommended but it was a nrml masaaledaar kebab which tasted good.

Cheese grilled chicken up next and that stole the show, super cheese melting on succulent chicken served on a bed of mashed potato.....to much of foodgasm in one plate.

The staff are nice and service is prompt.

Cost, could have been a bit more relaxed.

One of my fav place in town. I love their food, great taste and amazing quantity. Recently i tried their chicken steak, chicken ala-kiev, fish &chips, grilled garlic chicken, pina colada. I loved it, the fish and chips is just too good. Price is very much affordable. Overall a good experience.

Good hookah and starters will entertain your taste buds. Ask for the long filter, they r so much fun.
Alcohol is not available everyday, we ended up twice on dry days for the pub. We ordered prawn skewer and paneer tandoor. The presentation was as good as the taste. The prawn cud have been a bit more softer but the crispy outer coating made up for it. The paneer was delicious, only three round pieces, along side mashed potatoes and sauted exotic veggies. 
Then came the crispy chilly baby corn, which was a soar disappointment. In taste and texture. Go for the special things in the menu, they make it better. The garlic stir fried hakka noodles was too spicy so a spicy sign shud be indicated in the menu. It was fairly alright.

Located bang opposite RDB Cinema in Sector V, Salt Lake.

You enter through a corridor of neon red light and that for me was the main punch of this lounge cum cafe dedicated to sports.

Comfortable sofas and seats with a ultra modern neon light slick decor. Although dedicated to sports, the decor doesn't show up much of sports except for the TVs which show only sports channels.

But it surely is a very stylish place to be in.

Coming to the food, I had ordered a choco jane shake which is one of the best shakes I have had off late.
Fish Irani kebab which was recommended but it was a nrml masaaledaar kebab which tasted good.

Cheese grilled chicken up next and that stole the show, super cheese melting on succulent chicken served on a bed of mashed potato.....to much of foodgasm in one plate.

The staff are nice and service is prompt.

Cost, could have been a bit more relaxed.

Worst behavior from the staff. Went in to inquire about the offer they had on liquor, they handed me a Xerox which had the details. I went out with it when the waiter asked me very rudely without any reason to return that Xerox. I would have been there this weekend but not anymore.

Had a lot of fun coz visited with my 2 best pals at El Classico, good food good staff awesome ambience but definitely not a sports bar. Loved the long island tea probably the best I ever had and will go back just for that. Only one loud cry for help please play football or sports related matches on that big screen on game nights coz u name it as a sports bar. #LongIslandTea is must #Hala Madrid

Had been there twice. I personally didn't find the ambience quite interesting. The food was average, hookah is good, service is good, but seating arrangement and the area are not quite appealing. They do run bars on Fridays, Saturday and Sundays.
If you have a quite big group, then this is not your place to be.
Overall i would suggest you should short list some other places too.

I haven't had a good experience it One Sports Lounge.

Had gone there the other day I guess when some matches were going on. It was half empty. There were enough of seats for people to sit but then they wouldn't let us sit for one hour without us paying them Rs 1500 or 2000 per head. We weren't interested in the matches as well. There was no crowd plus we weren't getting to sit without paying a huge sum. They had asked us to sit in the inner rooms but we weren't comfortable when we tried sitting there.

We stayed there for like half an hour trying to convince them but to no avail.

Finally we left.

Based on the Ambience and however we felt that day, would rate One Sports Lounge a 3.0

Not a "sporty" lounge at all...I personally felt very claustrophobic...my legs were getting stuck under the table literally...it was hurting...service was not up to the mark...
We just had chicken nimbu kali mirch kebab and chilli garlic fried noodles...the kebab was good enough but we dint expect them to serve just 2 pcs of kebab...and the noodles was extremely dry...it had the consistency more like fried maggi...

I went to this place last week with my old college buddies. I must say its a very good place for hang out with friends. Hookah is available and they have also started ¬†Bar Exchange. So far I know it is the 2nd Bar Exchange in the city of joy after Sisha. ¬†Foods are really good according to the price quality and quantity. They serves large lamb pizza at only 300 bucks. I must suggest to take 'Gondhoraj Chicken', which I felt a unique combination with JW Black Label.

Pros:
+ Location: It is situated just opposite of RDB at Sector 5.
+ Good Ambiance¬†
+ Loud Music & Giant Screen for Live matches
+ Very Friendly Waiters and Good Service
+ Good Food with large varieties of imported drinks
+ They have an App from where one can check the live price change. No need to look at the tv screens for the price change.

Cons:¬†
- They don't serve any Premium Whiskeys like BP, Antiquity etc. I feel, it makes the lounge costly for the college students.
- ¬†The trading process is not good at the Bar Exchange. Once the price has changed, you will not be able to book the drink instantly. You need to call the waiter, the waiter will take the order and then he will go to the billing section to enter the order in the system. In the mean time the price may hike again and you have to pay the hiked amount. Hope they will soon make this process more easier, like providing a tablet at every table so that a person can book directly.

Among the list of all new lounge in sector 5, one sports lounge is good to talk about. Place is small and cozy but kind of shaddy. Good place to enjoy hookah with its smoky atmosphere.  Food was above average. I liked the pasta. The mocktail list is good. Menu variety should be increased. I liked the music played on the cafe all the time. So yes one can try out this place but it needs to improve in order to compete with other good cafe in sector 5.

Food: Ordered chicken peri peri pizza, oreo shake and chicken pasta. The pizza and the shake was really up to the mark! Must try. And about the pasta, although it tasted good, the garlic bread completely sucked - felt like having a toast biscuit quite honesetly.
Ambinence- great music and live sports! Too good.
So good food in a reasonable price.

This place has one of the best interiors...... This was on my checklist for a long time. My friends and others had given great reviews for this place. The place has a great ambience. It gives you the feel of being in a full blown sports bar sans the alcohol. The alcohol needs to be introduced real quick. Was in the mood for hookah along with my fiance.

We ordered the Elaichi and mint hookah in milk base, the gum supari with mojito base, the Pasta Aglio Olio, The sauteed Mushroom and the lemon ice tea.

All the preparations were really good. The hookahs were a bit strong, the sauteed mushrooms were delicious. The Pasta was really good and in my review competing with the Pasta Aglio Olio from Bikers cafe.

All in all had a lovely meal and a lovely evening.

This sports lounge in the city is one of a kind. Big screen, small everywhere around streaming live sports channels, sometimes playing EDMs, Desi songs videos. And I guess they are going to add bar stock exchange very soon, as soon as they get the liquor license.
We ordered a double flavored shisha, shroom penne, garlic bread with cheese, a kit kat shake, and another drink (forgot the name, it had a taste of coconut, and it tasted good). I have been here many a times as it's very near to my office. I keep visiting here for their lovely offers on hookah, food and drinks together!!
The pizza they make taste very good, a must try for the pizza lovers.

This place is pretty decent if you're looking for a late hangout and are in a large group. The ambience is really good. The prices, although not reasonable, are not too high either, when you look at the taste and quality. The pizza is undoubtedly one of the best I've ever had, and is simply amazing. I wouldn't recommend the Chinese though. I guess this place is worth try, but even if you decide not to, you're not missing out on much.

Was searching for a nice place to have a good food yesterday .Me and my friends decided to visit this place.The outlook of the lounge attracted us.At 1st when went inside we whr not too sure abt the decision.Thought of ordering 2 starters then go some where else.We ordered a tandoori platter and pizza spinachi from there menu.
The service was prompt.The moment we tried the first item from the platter we were taken aback bt the taste and freshness.The accompanying mint chutney i think was the freshest i have ever tasted(other than at home).All three of us wr very mucj impressed with the quality of food and freshness of ingredients used.the pizza was also very good snd even the portion size was good.
All in all it command s a 2nd visit.
The only turnoff was the loud music.

Located right opposite to RDB Boulevard, this sports lounge cum cafe welcomes its guest with its great great ambience of red highlighted geometric mirror blocks decoration at the bar which draws attention of the visitors and the giant TV screen on one of its side. It also has some areas for private party/celebration. Ordered Kulfi Shake and stuffed mushroom which was good in taste and the rates are reasonable.

Had a wonderful time at this outlet after college with friends. The staff members were very friendly and prompt and communicated very well with us. The monsoon combos are pretty exciting and they are providing it in quite an affordable rate.

We took 2 combos one was with two cokes one shisha of double flavor of ur choice and one large pizza again of our own choice. This was really great and we also took the Chinese starter combo that  comprised of 2 mojitos ....

Go for it and have a wonderful time..

Located right opposite to RDB Boulevard, this sports lounge cum cafe welcomes its guest with its great great ambience of red highlighted geometric mirror blocks decoration at the bar which draws attention of the visitors and the giant TV screen on one of its side. It also has some areas for private party/celebration. Ordered Kulfi Shake and stuffed mushroom which was good in taste and the rates are reasonable. The service was good with the staffs around attending the guests.

Went to this place last saturday to hang out with friends. It is located just opposite of Rdb boulevard.
The interiors are sports theamed with a huge projector tv and pictures of India's sportsperson. 
The service was good the serbers were helpful and very behaved. 
Comming to the food we ordered a hookah and starters which included chicken 65, gondhoraj murg, french fries, and fried prawns all of which were very tasty. Specially the gondhoraj murg which was very tender and tasty.
Definitely would visit again ..... 
Cheers !!

It is situated near to RDB and other hookah places such as chai break and others are all closely linked so its a pretty tough competition. It was a bit empty when we entered, around 1pm. The interiors are nice, just how a sports lounge should be. We ordered pink lady shisha and dry chilli chicken, babycorn and fries. The good were good, I liked it. Even the services are nice. Hope to come back here again soon.

So, its the one sports lounge which is going to make big in upcoming months!
Have been planing to go to this place for long, as its just behind my college and finally went here the last day. Amazing lights, nice entrance also the decor and space of the restaurant is well sought. This place has a bar, unfortunately not serving alcohol yet but next month they are starting with alcohol along with the concept of bar stock exchange! So fingers crossed!
They have a big screen and few smaller tvs showing different sports channels, i loved their collection of music, very loud and peppy!
Well, last day we had hookah and food at this place which was very good. We took veg pizza combo, nonveg chinese starter combo and crispy lambs. The pizza served was big size pizza, thin crust and just perfect(we had four cheese pizza). For chinese combo we chose salt and pepper fish, which was crispy coated and soft basa inside. The mojitos seemed more of an iced tea and mint, but tasted good. Flavors of hookah were brainfreezer+springwater and supari+gum, both were nice(Coal change was free).
The lamb was too crisp and i did not feel that i was having lamb,it was cooked nicely, which is good for me as i dont like lamb.
Food price is very reasonable, quantity was also good for 4 of us! Service is nice, but servers has less knowledge about the menu as one of them told us crispy lamb would come in pieces where as it was shredded.
These few glitches kept me from giving this place 5 star, also waiting for one lounge to start with the alcohol thing soon!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This review is after my third visit, when finally the bar stock exchange is implemented, where they have failed to live up to my expectations. There should be an app or more clear view to the changing prices of alcohol, even the servers are not sure of the prices. Secondly we had ordered for sangria but last day all we got was a mixed juice with a hint of red wine. On asking to change, they argued and tried to stick to the point that what we were served with was sangria, later on they changed the drink with a few percent extra wine to the juice. Im really shocked to see such behavior, such poor quality drinks and such casualty of the staff. Hence re-rating this place from 4 stars to 3, I would also never wish to return back.

Nice place to be with friends and watch a sports event. Nice ambience. Many screens to watch sports. Music video screening using projector. It would be great if we could have some beer over there. :p
Been there in two occasions. Hookah was the main focus both the times. First time had brain freezer and second time tried Double Apple. Both the hookahs were good. Stuck in the club menus in case of food both the times. Had Chicken burger, lasagna, Lebanese wrap. All were good. It's a nice place to visit on a matchday with friends to have some hookah and enjoy the game.

Chilling scenes everywhere. People out there spend time over hookah, food and friends with music and lighting. The concept of this lounge is based on sports that means everywhere you look you can find different sports are being featured on the televisions. The lounge is quite spacious and the main thing that i liked about the lounge is the lighting at the entrance. The ambiance, the management, the food everything was quite good. So in order to relax over a hookah in the commercial hub, i would prefer One Sports Lounge.

I seldom give such high ratings to places. One Sports Lounge is definitely a good place for a hangout when you're not in a mood to drink but want good shisha and good music.

LOCATION & AMBIANCE:
Essentially a sports lounge, the place doubles up as a lounge in the busy area of sector. The location is right opposite rdb boulevard, so brownie points for that.
The place is divided between 4 sections. Namely the small area overlooking the main bar area, the bar area with projection screens and two inner sections for large groups.
The red lights add to the ambiance, working well with the wooden furniture. Some posters of cricketers and live screenings showing different sports helps build on the theme. The music today was Punjabi and Bollywood.

FOOD:
We ordered for sauteed mushrooms as appetizer and the dish was wonderfully cooked! It was cooked in butter and and cheese, topped with black olives. It was garnished with parsley and was served with a salad which was good as well. #recommended
The sheesha we ordered was spring water rasna and it was made very well.
We tried their quatra pizza and it was delicious! #recommended
Few soft drinks were ordered to help with the pizza. 
The food was amazing!

SERVICE:
The service was very good and they impressed me with their hospitality! Extremely helpful with suggestions and served the food and were prompt with refills.

PRICE:
I found the place to be economical and they are currently having some promos also going. We paid 900 for our afternoon.

Sector v is surely soaring with good options and one sports lounge is definitely one of them!
Best wishes to one sports lounge for successful years and great patronage!

You know something is not right when you enter a place on a Friday night and find that it is completely vacant and you get to choose your own seats, etc. You know something is not right when the number of staff is more than the number of guest and again this on a Friday night. The ambience was good with music and comfortable seating. You can sense that this place will be a hit when there is a major sports event given the projectors and the multiple screens. However for that to happen, it really needs to quickly get the alcohol license. People will not visit a sports lounge for just food and that too average food. Would suggest that you wait till it starts offering alcohol and then this will probably be one of the interesting places in Sector 5.

Right opposite to RDB Cinemas. As the name suggests, totally a sports themed lounge with all kinda sports screening with a big attractive LCD. I really liked their interiors and is a cozy place to catch up with friends.
Waiters are courteous and prompt.
Food is even pretty decent.
Tried Bruschetta which had tomatoes, olives as stuffings and was a bit on the spicey side. It was good in taste.
Would definitely like to drop in again.

I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon with four more friends. Overflowing with redlights, the entrance was quite an energy. The place is divided into many small sections. We ordered a mix of smoothies and shakes, all made good. Oreo shake was okay. We ordered veggie delight salad, good. Crispy mushroom, nice. Spaghetti in mixed sauce, average. Veg peri peri pizza, average. Chilli cheese toast, good. Overall the food didn't excite us so much. Shisha was amazing though. Music was loud and peppy throughout. Service was nice.

The place is located just opposite to BBQ Nation, where there was xoxo bar. The ambience of the place will pump up your adrenaline. I've not been to many sports lounges, but I feel they have nailed it. The lighting, the giant screens, the loud sound, the bar(they were yet to get alcohol permit when I was there in May), seats everything exudes sporty outlook. But I was surprised to see (taste) how good the food quality was.  Each item had its distinct taste and each of them were yummy in their own way. Not many places can do justice to fish items...but they did.

Pros:
1. Ambience is top notch.
2. Food has distinctive and yummy taste.
3. Prime location.

Cons:
1. Prices are on the higher side, but that's how it is for almost every themed restaurants.

Such an awesome place to hangout. This is how I rate it:
1. Ambience- 8.5/10 ( music, screens, vids, lighting everything was perfect.)
2. Service- 7/10
3. Drinks(mocktails)- Tried Virgin Mojito, it was very good. 9/10
4. Hookah- 8/10
5. Food- Well, this was quite unexpected. Tried Indian style chicken pizza, believe me it was way too better from the pizzas that we often eat. One of the best pizzas I have ever had. 9.5/10
Thumps up with big smile, ll visit again for sure..

Starting with positive things,this cafe has got some excellent  interiors and ambiance with  a  huge seating arena and fully sports equipped theme.
Now the food...it was good in taste but the variety was just limited in vegetarian section and among that limited variety,many were unavailable.
Atlast the service,which was just below average as the people there dont know any thing about making shisha and are totally confused while taking order for food.

Must visit once to see that excellemt interiors and ambiance.

Located in sector v, this sports themed hookah bar ticks all the checks. Totally worth it. It's as pretty from the exterior as it is from the interior. 

Ambiance : In a single word, sexy. It has a really rich look from the outside and its maintained even after you enter. Golden lights with red leather chairs and sofa adore the lounge. Gives a really rich feel. Well lit. It has 3 seperate sections. Loved how the concept of "sports" is emphasizes where different sports are played on different tv screens all the time. 


Food : We ordered one platter which was their speciality and peri peri pizza. The platter was delicious. One must try the platter. From the presentation to the how it fulfils your taste buds, it's value for money. The peri peri pizza was quite decent. 8 slices for around 350. 

Drinks : Can't wait till this place gets the bar license. We had to make do with mock tails for the time being. Marshmallow and oreo shake were ordered which were both Well prepared. 

Service : Quick and the staff are well trained and courteous. 

Shisha : What is there not to like about it. We ordered the kiwi gum spring water.. 

Pocket pinch : taxes as of now are not currently leviable so our bill for 4 came to 1500. 

I would highly recommend it.

Location:Located in the ground floor of Infinity benchmark,just opposite to RDB Boulevard in sector 5,in the same building that houses Ocean grill and the bytes foodcourt.

Ambience:Dark with red being the predominant colour,with seating arrangements ranging from sprawling couches for bigger groups to smaller seats for couples and also a private room.There are various LCDs screening a variety of sports channels,there's one playing contemporary music videos and loud music reverberates through the whole place. The aesthetics might not be super impressive but they have done a decent job.

Food-We had ordered a plate each of chilli garlic noodles,veg manchurian,one virgin mojito mocktail and a sheesha with Shahi paan+rose flavour.The noodles were delicious but the manchurians were semi-cooked though the gravy tasted nice.The mojito was on point and the hookah was smooth.

Service-Not satisfactory.The servers seemed clueless.Half the people of our group don't smoke sheesha.So we ordered just one for the rest of the three of us but they allegedly had some weird policy that a relatively bigger group would have to order two sheeshas.We would have understood their predicament if there was a line of people waiting for a table but it was a weekday afternoon and there was none.After making them see reason,they finally agreed but our server made some 3 trips to his manager for the same.He wasn't exactly rude but completely clueless which was a downer.But later he come to us and said he could bring the check sooner than we would like to,since we could avail the 25% discount scheme they have if the bill is made before 4 pm.That was a welcome gesture.

Overall it was an average experience and barring a few pictures of sports legends adorning a wall and the simultaneous screening of half a dozen sports' channels,this place doesn't stand out as a 'Sport's lounge'.But could be given a try because the food and hookah are decent and the prices are reasonable in the happy hours.

Went on a thursday afternoon to sip some coffee and have hookah. Overall interesting ambience, contrasting decor. 
Ordered for hot cappucino, quantity wise its better to sip coffee in ccd paying another 20 bucks extra coz quantity was dissapointing for a cup of cappucino which costed 130 bucks including tax. However, happy hours saved my bill of 20% coz i checked out before 4PM. Hookah was excellent.
What was dissapointing in the end is that while we were leaving around 3: 45 PM and it was just 15 mins left for the happy hour to end wherein a couple entered and asked if they order for food now will they fall under happy hour, the reply from the waiter was very sarcastic and unproffesional where he mentioned " If you finish your food within 4PM you are eligible to get the happy hour discount ". There was no need to reply in that way as this aggravated the customer and both were irate. The waiter insisted on his sarcasm and didnt feel apologetic atall. Request the management to take care of this as it may happen with anyone. Cheers!

Went there accidentally with couple of my seniors. For the first time I tried hookah here very reluctantly. I don't remember which hokaah I tried but it was an awesome feeling. Ordered Tai Pai Fish, Nachos Bin Salsa, Salt and Pepper Chicken and Salt and Pepper Fish to eat. Food quality is very good here. What I like most about this place is the ambiance. Very comfortable seating arrangements with beautiful interiors. Waiters are very polite and helpful. Service was very satisfactory.

Going by the name they have set up this place with screen and photographs of people from sports fraternity but as it was IPL going on we were feeling great  but else nothing sports about this place and yes they have good ambience with a lot in menu. We had a good time except we had a bad experience with the hookah which was unfortunately not upto the mark of our expectation. Decor was good n food was Ok.

Visited this place for an office party. The first thing that impressed me about this place is it's ambiance! You can visit this place if you are in a party mood. Food served to us was beyond our expectations. Chicken Cheese Kebab and Dry Chilly Fish were lip-smacking appetisers..Not to forget the crispy spring roll. Main course and mock tails were also good. Topping the list was the DJ... He stole our hearts and we danced like mad people throughout the evening.... Yes and as it's name suggests you can see all time sports screening here.... A must visit for party lovers  especially for people who visit Sector 5 daily for office, don't miss this place guys!

Not a worth place at all. THough they have a wonderful decor and a beautiful ambience with large screen for watching sports match. Only hookah available..the wonderful ambience would make you crave you for alcohol but they dont sell liquor.the music taste of the dj playing music is also not worth for such an ambience.coming to food menu,we orderd crispy chili baby corn whivh was to dry and hard to chew.but the lime cordial tasted good.. This place is located opposite to bbq nation in sector 5

Location : Ground floor, Infinity Benchmark. Opposite RDB Cinemas.

A recent addition to the long line of caf√© cum lounges category. A stylish logo on the outside which no one can pass without noticing. It is matched with an equally gorgeous d√©cor on the inside. They have not started serving alcohol as of yet but still boast of one of the best designed bar area in town. It has a hive design with red neon outlines in the background. Right at the entrance there is a super large projector that provides 4k video output and is definitely the finest projector setup around (better than Dugout). However there is a flaw in the sitting arrangements. On the lower deck, a person would have to turn sideways to get a full view of the giant screen, which can be discomforting. Also the management should know that keeping the speakers at a high volume level isn‚Äôt a show off but a turn down instead.

Now coming to the food, we utilised a combo deal which had a shisha and 2 red bulls. The hookah was well prepared with evident flavours. However it doesn‚Äôt last long, so I would advise them to use a better quality coal. Along with that we ordered the following‚Ä¶
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crispy Chilli Babycorn : A dish without which much of our orders are incomplete nowadays. There are 3 things you look for in a good babycorn prep. Crispness. Temperature. Spiciness. This one qualified all three. Thumbs up.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬† Pizza Caterina : All pizza variants available here sound really good, so we had hard picking out a single one. Finally went with pizza caterina and boy it was a great choice. It was thin crust with adequate amount of cheese accompanied by rich toppings of olives, mushrooms, babycorn and jalapenos.

Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt try some other items due to time constraints. The servers are not fully aware of the menu, which is a must. The place has equal number pros as there are cons, its strong hold being the food and ambience departments. Pocket pinch is on the lower side as the menu is inclusive of VAT and they only add an extra 10% service charge. Would have given it a higher rating if the bar was functional. They are soon to come up with bar stock exchange system though. Hoping for improvements soon.

After coming back to Kolkata after almost an year I wanted to enjoy the Sunday night watching the Premier League with friends. This sports lounge was the place suggested to me and we decided to give it a try.
Looks wise its really good, outside as well as the inside. Well decorated and sports posters make it comfortable lounge experience. However, maybe due to space constraint I guess, pool table is missing. Anyway, the projector and multiple screens caters to many people coming here to catch live matches. Sitting arrangement is a bit haphazard, can be re-arranged to create more space. Food is impeccable. Ordered loads of mocktails and starters, non veg platter, burger and pizza. Loved each and every dish. Speaking of service, response is a bit slow, loud music adds to the confusion but I am sure it can be improved. Bar is yet to open. Will be back when I return to Kolkata next time, hopefully to be surprised with the improvements. Overall, a wonderful night out can be enjoyed with friends and relatives if you are a sports or music buff. Also include some English tracks instead of Punjabi Pop to spice up your playlist. Cheers!!

Has an amazing location, ¬†bang opposite RDB cinemas. The interior is well lit and quite chic. Staff is decent and service is quite prompt. They have 3-4 seating areas for different group of people. At times it gives a very crammed up and claustrophobic feeling with tables and chairs all around. Food is decent and is aggressively priced. Since its a new joint , taxes donot apply making it 25% cheaper than other joints. The main area has a large screen and a projector , a must for sports enthusiasts.

IPL season is here, and can't get a better excuse than to visit this newest Sports Lounge Bar right at the hub of Sector 5, where earlier XOXO lounge used to be.. Though my visit was a short one and I am yet to get a complete experience of their spread all I can say is that this place is bound to grow in coming days.. 4k Projections, Multi-Level seating arrangements with a private dining room, a huge lounge area and an elevated private party zone this place has it all..Coupled with a wide array of lip-smacking pub dishes at an Economical rate and a wide selection of HOOKAH..what more can u ask for..
The ambiance is lively, chic interiors with all the modern amenities fits its name aptly.. The service is just spot on..What impressed me was their HOSPITALITY.. Since my friend's Cold Coffee was a little out of flavour they took the pain to replace it even though we insisted not to do so..We tasted OREO SHAKE, COLD COFEE and SHANGHAI PRAWNS and all were perfectly made.. Nothing we can complain..Also VAT is inclusive in the menu itself and they only charge 10% service tax extra..Our cheque was just Rs.605/-(all incl.)..
I am eager to watch the Full Movie now since the Trailer itself is so promising..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

A sports lounge can be safely defined as a bar catering especially to sports fans and typically containing several televisions and often sports memorabilia. Sadly my two visits to One Sports Lounge saw nothing but several loopholes.

A pretty pepped up replacement to the former Buddha Lounge on the ground floor of Infinity Benchmark, Sector V , Salt Lake; The decor of One Sports Lounge will definitely bowl you over. There are red infra reds, Honey comb like bar set up, 4 different seating sections, multiple television screens blaring sports out loud!

Why was it still disappointing?

First, for a sports lounge, this one DOESN'T have a functional bar YET! I don't get the logic of opening a sports bar minus alcohol anyway but what really appalled me was zero inclusion of coolers and mocktails on the menu as a replacement for the same. To top it off there was tea, coffee and milkshakes in the name of beverages! If this isn't an Epic Fail, I don't know what is!

Coming to the food, we ordered Fish and Chips with Tarter Sauce and Spaghetti Bolognese (Lamb) and on request we even got ourselves Virgin Mojito's too.
Let's get to the good stuff here.
The Spaghetti was exquisite with the minced lamb cooked to perfection that you didn't require condiments at all! My compliments to the chef on that.

Now the bad stuff: The Fish and Chips was the worst I've ever tasted- Over fried to a point of looking burnt and honestly more crust heavy than the fish content! An authentic fish and chips ideally is supposed to be beer batter fried served with herbed potato wedges but in this case there were homemade french fries, some prawn chips, a minuscule helping of tarter sauce and some picked vegetables. Not my idea of perfection at all! Sorry!

The Mojito's were refreshing till half glass, then we were left with sugar granules in our mouths! Another thumbs down here!

Coming to the service: Very little staff to cater to so many guests, and as a result terribly slow service. With the music being loud, it was difficult to even catch your server's attention.

The saving grace in the entire dining experience (apart from the ambience and music of course) was their hookahs. Not only were they smooth but flavourful to say the least.

All in all, the Sports Lounge bit is a facade. To be honest, it just seemed like another youngsters "Hookah parlour" cum cafe to me! These guys need a long way to go to attain that status and I pray to God that happens soon enough.

After the old "Winning Streak", Kolkata desperately needs a good Sports Bar/ Lounge for the OLDER sports fans, young at heart!

Went today for a group hangout. This place has earned our 'must visit' place in Saltlake,Sector V. There are few places which counts for a second visit soon and this place is among those. Ambience,service and food is really good. Quite impressed with their Mongolian Rice. However, a bit of working is required on the Shishas,rest all is very nice.HAPPY :)

One can be THE One...but they'll have to be consistent. They are new and learning. But if you want to play with the big boys..you'll have to up your game.¬†The food is well prepared and relatively cheap. The ambiance is nice. People who loves to eat have a lot to ask before ordering..so knowing about your dishes and specialty and availability is very necessary...Eagerly waiting for the Bar Stock Exchange to come up...

A good place to chill out with friends esp if you want Hookah, in a 'happening looking' place. waitstaff were friendly and very efficient, and gave descriptive information on various dishes. The food was delicious, fresh and flavorful. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and very clean. Love the color theme.

I usually never give reviews just based on behaviour and not food but this place for ed me to change. During an india pakistan matcxh u expect a sports lounge to be welcoming and accommodate you even with just a place to stand but it wasn't the case here. When me and a friend went in this place we were simply told to leave before asking us anything else. There was clearly some place in the bar so we asked if we could just stand in the bar but the waiters said kindly leave we do not hv place nor do we entertain sitting in the bar. Shocked by the behaviour we just left. I don't think i would get a chance to review this place on the basis of their food as i wont visit again hence this review goes only on the basis of behavior.

Good place, good music, reasonable rates, cordial staff, traceable location and of course good food. Combo meal is economical and seesha is decent. Also, for a sports fan, the big screen and the small screens are just what you need to enjoy a match with your buddies. 4.5/5 because not a zone for photo freaks as lights are too dim.

Pros: Theme and Service
Cons: Monotonous menu

Flaws Flaws Flaws! As A Regular at this establishment I would like to specify that One Sports Lounge has a lot to improve before it can function with the elites of Sec 5. 
The 100 Seater Lounge, has many Pros, thats for sure but the flaws can diminish them in a matter of minutes.
Situated Opp Chai Break Lounge Sec 5, One is a Sports Lounge & Stock Exchange Bar (Which is still to Start). One's interiors is a rare treat in Kolkata, with Comfortable seating, amazing sound clarity, Projector & Tvs situated all around so one can not avoid it in any way.
 The food is a suprising factor, With a huge menu, and nominal rates, the taste and quality is a major plus.
Now the flaws, Service, as One has left a large Open Floor (Presumebly for Dancing), it gives a emptiness feel even when the Place is completely packed, the staff (around 12 Waiters) are always there to attend to the customers. They are very ill-informed about Their Menu, The Hookah Section, The Combos. After Constant "Ek Second Sir" & "I'll check Sir" your orders are placed and re-confirmed. The Delay is what gets you, Delay in Food Preparation, I have ordered Burgers And Starters they all take a good 20 25 Mins to show up.
The Hookah is a nail in the coffin, takes 15 20 minutes by principle every time. For an establishment that was supposed to come up with a bar stock exchange by 13th Feb, and is situated Opp Chai Break a heavy weight in the industry, you have to at least get a staff that can cope up with your orders now before you even have a bar that has a specific need of being served on time.
The ideal chit chat by waiters around your table feels like we as customers are invading their privacy. 
These flaws should have been inproved within a months of openning that is why i have waited to review this place. But now after 16 Visites the problems carry on. 
Like My Visit On 17th March, after the extra clarifications to the waiter trying to explain my order properly, I ordered a Shisha at precisly 5 29 PM (Capacity at that time : 35 40). At which point a table of 2 entered next to mine, at about 5 32, they probably ordered after that, their Shisha arrived at 5 38 PM. My Hookah was kept on my table at 5 52 Pm. (23 Minutes Later when the cafe was only 40% Occupied).
These maybe minor flaws but the owners need to fix them before they start on a downward spiral and people realise Chai Break is a better option when it comed to Hookah.
Cheers!.

Another new destination in Sector V - "One Sports Lounge". Opposite to Chai Break.
The decor resembles typical American sports bar. You will find 4k protection on giant screen, large LCD TVs, lounge sitting at different levels, loud music, heard stopping sub-woofer, bar-stool everything.
The vast menu ranges from Chinese to American and from Italian to Mexican. Flavoured hookah and separate smoking room for smokers.
We opted for Chinese. The tastes was far from authentic but typical Indo-Chinese. But all dishes tasted good.
Best part - Prices mentioned in the menu card were inclusive of all taxes. They just added 10% Service Charge. So you pretty much know how much you gonna pay.
We went there on Tuesday 1 pm, it was almost empty. Naturally, the service was quick. I am eager to know if they can keep the same service level during busy hours too.
Total check for 3 non-veg starters, 1 noodles, 2 plates of fried-rice, 2 non-veg side dishes and 5 sweet lime sodas was Rs.2430 (all inclusive). Food was enough for 5 hungry-foodie guys.
Not a bad place at all. Only thing is how long they can keep up the good work. Or rather, how long they want to keep this quality and price.

One Sports Lounge located right in front of RDB Cinemas.. This lounge is created for sport lovers with projector screens & television for watching the match intently! But somehow doesnt work coz the music they play is not that happening.. Take a cue from Ground Zero! So this place is hookah lounge and they may get the bar license soon.. 
Looks good the ambience as there are private corners to spend with buddies..
Tried Caesar Salad which was a big disappointment!
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: twas very soggy.. Cdnt entice us!
The Kebab Platter: this platter has varied preparations but it fails to impress us coz theres no flavours whatsoever
The Staff are ok but theres lack of serving and they need to pay attention.. Pocket pinch according to the order is exhorbitant.. Please improve it..
Please post in your views on this one!

Went there a couple of times with friends. The place is located right opposite to RDB boulevard building (Opposite Chai Break).
It's an ideal place to chill with friends, watch a football/cricket match along with Sheesha. On the days when there is no matches, they play amazing music with enthralling videos. The place is pocket is friendly with economical combos available at Rs 599 (A sheesha, 2 mocktails and 2 starters).  The food was good, but not great. Same goes for the Sheesha. No alchohol was a drawback but now they are opening their own Bar Stock Exchange.
Ambience : 4/5
Food : 3/5
Music : 4/5

It's a newly opened sports lounge in sector 5, just opposite to RDB. It's got a huge screen with projector and also few small LCDs which kind of give you a feeling of a TV showroom. We ordered stuffed mushrooms but couldn't find any stuffing in it rather it was sort of mushroom chilly that also not great in taste. The pizza was also not that great.
We had ordered 5 pan hookah which was pretty good.

This place deserves all the appreciation. Firstly because of the location, it is right opposite RDB where XOXO lounge used to be. Secondly they have made different sections with different atmosphere and mood. There is a large screen for sports screening and awesome music. Thirdly the food is amazing. We called for an American salt pepper corn. It was lip smacking with indian tandoori flavours. The drinks were superb too, especially the oreo shake.  We also called for a strawberry cheesecake. Though fresh strawberries were missing but you could definitely say that the cheesecake was very well made. The waiters are courteous and always serving with a smile. And the best part is that it is quite affordable. For 2 starters,  3 drinks,  1 main course, 1 hookah and 1 dessert we paid 1300 only. The only sad part is that they not have the bar license yet.

This hookah parlour,a new member of sec 5, is going to give a tough competition to all the hookah parlours and pubs when they ll start their bar section in April. 

* Location : Located just opposite of famous sec 5 RDB CINEMAS AND AT THE GROUND FLOOR OF INFINITY BENCH MARK BUILDING at RDB stoppage, its a massive hit food outlet location wise.

* Decor : After coming across numerous pubs and hookah parlour, I can say that I ve visited probably the most beautifully and smartly decorated hookah parlour in Kolkata. You can have all speciality here : private corners for partners, large couches for friend's meeting, very comfortable sofas for a large group and so on. Large space inside and many sections....all are separated in rooms.
A giant screen over there is perfectly fitted for live sports or good music, even rocking songs also. A separate bar counter is decorated marvellously that I only experience in Mumbai or Hyderabad pubs. Over all I liked the ambience so and so much that I really enjoyed a lot in that calm, cool and at some times electrifying choosy music bits. (rating 9 on 10)
I am sure the interior decorator ll change some sofas when they ll start the bar section cz those sofas are good for hookahs,but not for drinks.

* food : They have a large variety of menu and I was getting confuse what to take and what not. Lastly I ordered: 
1. Parmesan chicken fingers (cooked with a special kind of chicken) (rating 10 on 10)
2. Taipei Fish ( a good continental fishy item, you would like it along with hookah) (rating 10 on 10)
3. Mocktails were very good...chilled and perfectly tasted. I took the orange squash (rating 9 on 10)
4. Cheese salad. A big bowl of good quantity healthy salad, perfectly matched with hookah (rating 10 on 10)
5. Pan rasna hookah flavour (good, smoky and finely made coal) (rating 10 on 10)

* Management : Its a new hookah parlour,not known so much and we went @ late evening 9.30. So the parlour was not crowded and the staffs were attending personally in every tables. Even the manager asked for further betterment suggestion and cordially asked if we were satisfied with the service. I liked this professionalism very much. (rating 10 on 10)

* Price : As compared to an unique and very spacious decor, the price is pocket friendly and quantity and quality of food is very good. If they could remain this much price after starting the bar section, then it ll be a super hit for sure. (rating 10 on 10)

* Special feature : A curious menu card. In every page you ll come across some inspirational thoughts. I liked the best a speech from Md Ali,the boxer " if you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize. " Who knows,may be it is the warning to all sec 5 pubs from this outlet. Quite superb menu card.

* Why recommended : a) For fabulous decoration, new experience for Kolkata pub lovers.
2) For beautifully made continental items....may it be chicken,lamb, fish or prawn.
3) Trust me,its pocket friendly. @priyabrata ganguly

We were looking for a new place in salt lake when we stumbled upon this newly opened cafe. The place is located opposite to RDB in sector 5. I quite liked their decor though the seating could be better. The first thing you notice on entering is the bar (which did not have alcohol yet) . We took our seat and ordered for a combo which included a sheesha, chilli chicken dry and a mocktail. The sheesha was nice and i had no complains, smoke and flavour we very good. 

The chicken was also very flavourful tender and juicy. I really liked it and was almost tempted to order for another plate. The fresh lime soda was well fresh like soda, you really cant go too wrong with it. 

The staff was well behaved and service was prompt. Though we faced an issue while billing as the card machine was not working and they had just one machine. It took quite long to sort that out.

The bill was for about 800 which is decent and quite standard for any visit to a cafe these days. Definitely worth a visit and even more when the alcohol starts( not sure if it has yet)

Finally visited this outlet with my friends. Went to this place on Sunday evening. Decor is fantabulous. Very spacious, lot of people to sit in. The music plays at a optimum volume. Pocket friendly. Alcohol wasn't available, but a huge bar was there. We had ordered for shisha( they were confused about single flavor, saying it double, but it was a single flavor), potato wedges, spinach pizza. Food was yummy. Service was fine.

Availability of hookah and good food with not much intentions towards completely draining your pockets. The seats could me made better.  The bar section looks awesome. A very good place to be at times of sport events.  Alcohol is yet to come.  Overall I enjoyed it there and service is very good.

Went to this place on Friday and was really impressed by the decor. Availability of hookah at pocket friendly price is the only the plus point. 
The food tastes average. Most of them tastes bad.

But there's a lot of point which they need to work upon. 
The ambience could be bettered . Well no one would want to watch punjabi song videos not hear the cricket commentary . One can just mute the cricket match and play some nice English/Hindi songs and that would be simply great. Coming to the seating arrangement, please do reconsider it. Rather change them completely!
Introduce board games. 
Any restaurant will have regular water and not only bottled water so try serving regular water as well. 
Lastly the staff should let people finish off their food and then they can take away the plates, spoons etc. 
And they only give fork neither spoons nor knives. 
You will have to reach out to the staff for each and every little thing until you yourself get irritated and let go of it. 
Pretty much not expected. 
Never coming back again !

First of all Great ambience!! 
Went there for a team lunch. We ordered the veg combo, non veg combo, pasta, sweet lime, virjin mojito & a hookah.
Veg combo/non veg combo - It had crispy chilli baby corn- It should be named soggy chilly babycorn.
Hakka chow- tasted blant- was served chilled
Manchurian - tasted good but again served chilled.
Cheese chicken kebab - was the best 
Sweet lime - we asked for sweet and sour and were served sour, after sending it back again it returned almost the same.
Pasta - Mix sause penne - was good and hot for a change 
Virgin mojito - never had a virgin mojito as bad as this.
Paneer kebab - It was good.
And lastly the hookah - Hookah was the best thing we ordered.
Final verdict-
Ambience 7/10
Food 2/10
Hookah 6/10
Staff 5/10
If you wanna go please take ample time as they take time for serving.
Would recommend only for hookah and ambience and clicking pics at the entrance üòé

Alright, was hearing about this place from a few friends.... So finally decided to make a visit.... Went in here over a Saturday evening, and i must say the decor is fantabulous... Absolutely apt for a Sports Lounge, very spacious, a lot of different sections to sit in, and a huge bar (though no alcohol). So this Saturday was also supposed to be the India vs Pakistan match, and a giant screen was setup which added to the ambiance and i personally loved it.
Coming down to the food, it was good.. the garnishing and the taste both were pretty good.... But one place i would believe they can improve is on the servicing, that is training the people who are serving regarding hospitality etiquette... Pretty weird if some comes up and tries to take away your drink when you havent finished it yet.. Else a great place.. MUST GO...

Hope this helps !! Happy Munchin :)

Went to this place on Sunday. Ambience was good, although the music was way too loud. They refused to serve filtered water and we had to order for bottled water. The starters and soup were a bit salty. Pizza was good. The service was descent. When I wanted to see the private party area, I was shown the same very reluctantly by a waiter. The sooner these problems are addressed, the better this place will be. Shisha was nicely made, real good.

Some things that the management need to know 
1) Apparantly... no cash settlement  is alllowed ..and when i heard this...and questioned the peraon..he said " we only accept cards...or only if u have exact cash then we will.accept"..i am still confused
2) i was asked." Do u want your bottled water cold or room temperature?"  When i said regular filtered water is fine...i was stunned by the reply.." we only serve..bottled water..its.as per our 'fine dining' standard policy...
Well i certainly request the management to gothru the f&b rules of running a restraunt !! even the best of the best restaurants Have to serve regular filtered drinking water !!!
3) the food..i ordered an Ala kiev..which wasn't bad...

But then...over all.experience was..below par...and the reasons are my point 1 & 2
33% ratings fr the entire experience.

Visited this lounge a week back, this is the latest lounge in Salt Lake,Sector V, just opposite to bar b que nation. Ambiance and food is too good. If you are a vegetarian u have lot of options to choose, generally most of the lounge does not have much vegetarian selection. But here you get varieties to choose from. Paneer jalwa had showed itz jalwa, it was very nice, veg spring roll and dahi kebab was very good too. Pasta in white sauce was ultimate. Since the bar has not started yet. I tried the Oreo and kit kat shake. Both the shakes was amazing. U can also try varieties of hookah. 
For the non vegetarian jumbo prawn in horse raddish sauce is must try. For main course we had chinese cuisine which was very good.

The projector resolution is very high and the screen is big enough. There is a private area too where 15-20 people can accommodate. 

Food and ambiance is too good. Bar will be starting in another month or two.

An average experience on the first visit at this place. The x factor being that the only lounge in sector 5. Was dissapointed with the unavailability of Pomodoro Bruschetta. Also a bad experience when I got to know there werw no desserts available. So we went on to have Chinese. Thukpa was well prepared but contained a lot of pepper. We also ordered Chilly Garlic noodles and Veg Manchurian: both were good. Giant screen n loud music is a plus point. However they could have made the seating arrangement better. Availability of hookah is also a plus point. 
Needs improvement.

We went to this place on Monday afternoon... Overall experience was not good... First they asked us to change the seat coz a bigger group came.. Lot of item in d menu were not available which was informed to us only after some time of ordering... No regular water available only bottled water...We ordered veg food from the menu which was very good. Can visit next time for the food. Hope by then these things will be sorted out.

Ordered for Greek salad and chicken ala Kiev but they provided totally differrent.there is no olive into the salads and without lemon vinaigrette dressing.also very less cheese. And the chicken ala Kiev should be crust outside but it was totally like roast chicken in wine sauce.such a big disappointing experience.

One Sports Lounge, one of my recent favorites, has been creating a lot of buzz around and why not especially with its breathtakingly colorful d√©cor and the wooden interiors with luminous LED lighting. Located in the middle of the IT hub, it is an escape route for many IT professionals after a busy day at work or in between meetings to pamper their taste buds with something new and something different!!! The property brings in a new concept of bar stock exchange, personalized lounge area, and a gigantic projector with live screening of matches which is just another breakout option for us to peep at the score and watch our favorite sportsmen in action.

¬†The food is mind-blowingly awesome and not at all cliche ranging from Indian to Continental, Italian and Chinese Cuisines. It is THE place for all food lovers always willing to try out variety at a very reasonable price. And lastly all this comes at an exceptional service right from the Management to One sports Lounge staff!!!.  A must visit place for we Calcuttans.

This is a recently opened place which has a great new concept and some awesome pub finger food. It's worth a visit as they have something called a live stock on alcohol where the prices fluctuate as per demand. Though you end up spending the same as you would anywhere else the whole concept is worth it. A must visit if you are in the area.

Located in the heart of IT hub, this uber cool lounge is a perfect place to grab a quick bite inbetween meetings or let your hair loose and chill in the evening. 
I have been to this place twice and what i love most about the interior is it has segregation by adding different levels. So, you get a sense of privacy without feeling compartmentalised. The other point which impressed me a lot about the ambiance is the volume of the music. It's optimum for a lounge. You can enjoy having a conversation and also groove to the music. Most lounges gives you the feel of a nightclub by drowning you in music. So i loved this sensibility.
The food is lip smacking. I tried the Tandoori Jhinga, fish Irani and Malai kabab and they were yummy. The staff are cheerful and the service was swift. Very few newly opened places can have everything in place so, I am very happy with One Sports Lounge experience.

One sports lounge is my most favourite lounge since it's open the door for us . Every thing is made with a lot of care, the hard work and sensibility reflects in their contemporary decor. The lounge is perfects in all aspects, starting from their menu selections to the hookahs. We ordered the fish kebab and I must tell it's the best fish kebab I've ever had in a long time . The tandoori prawns were exquisite. The kebab platter was something we all enjoyed thoroughly.
I recommend trying this new lounge in town . Though it's far from my place but I will ensure a visit on a regular basis . Keep rocking Team ONE . All the very best .

There are lot of reasons for one to come and enjoy at this place. 
1. If one is looking to do some meetings. Just come in and enjoy the place with laptop charging points at your own table in a private area over good beverages and food.
2. In the evening if you want to have nice quality time with Hookah u have specially designated booth for such times.
3. Wanna watch a football, cricket or tennis u have the 4K big screen to do so over beer.
4. Ultimate party destination with the best drinks and food 
All in all this place blends in the perfect combination of good food and beverages during day time for your nice lunch or meeting during office hour and the ultimate destination for your late night parties over best drinks and hookah. Drinks and food are well priced and tasty. Specially with the stock exchange coming in, the prices will become more competitive.

One Sports Lounge is a swanky new chill out zone. It's got a brilliant facade, huge french windows. The interiors have been done up well, the brilliant placements of lights give the place the perfect look. There are separate zones created... One for hookah, one for the vip lounge and the main lounge. There's this huge screen where any sport would be a delight to watch. 
The food was awesome, the fish items and the golden fried prawns were especially brilliant. The pricing is reasonable. The staff is friendly and swift. The hookah was also very good. had a good time at One Sports Lounge.

Awesome!!!! That's the word that perfectly describes the place. With honey comb like interiors, electrifying atmosphere lights ...seeing on which one would go wow...!!!this is what Kolkata needed a lounge with great taste buds tantalizing food, lip smacking mocktails and if that isn't enough they even have senses arousing sheesha to magnetize you towards them. I recently on the 5th Feb 2016 with my wife celebrated our first anniversary here. It was a gathering of around 35 people,and by God was the service something special. A team headed by Dheeraj a very versatile individual, had done everything by our means for us to leave with a very bright smile on our faces. The music which they play is wow as well and if that's not enough they even have plans of serving booze in the lounge. Well done Sunny Jaiswal, Rohit Jaiswal and team and places like Backstage and Shimmers watch your backs because here comes One Sports Lounge with all guns blazing !!!!!!!

Great place to chill.Being a bar stock exchange it has done pretty good job on the decor th abar is really widespread and nicely decorated with all the LED lights which looks very fluorescent and decks it up quite well.It has a nice small dance floor but you won't like to dance in these places being the reason it's a BSA.So coming to main aspects the food wasn't that bad ..we tried very generic dishes like hakka chicken dry chilly fish and chicken manchurian which was descentlt okay.T leg draught beer took forever to come though it was descently prized.The prices didn't much go down when we went anyways we had descent experience.

Went there to watch the El-Clasico (didn't proved to be fruitful for my team though) yesterday..
Came to know at the entry of this lounge, that stag entry isn't allowed though there was no info regarding that, neither in zomato nor when we called the manager earlier! üëé
Then, we had to pay 'caution money' to get entry, which they informed would be adjusted from our final bill..
Giant screen in here is alright.. Though most of the drinks we asked for couldn't be served because of non-supply.. Corona was the only beer they had.. So we were forced to take it.. Food and hookah was OK.. Pocket pinch of this place is on the high side though the overall experience was nothing extraordinary!

Located at a very convenience place in sector 5. One sports lounge gave me a good experience.
The ambience was sober. Giving it a 4/5.
The staff was very slow. I literally had to shout to call out to the staff. However, they were friendly.
I had ordered a tandoori platter which was good. Mushroom could have been more. 
A pizza which was nothing very great, just simple veggie pizza.
A Chinese platter who's quantity I felt was very poor.
The hookah was good, smooth.
Pocket pinch was fair. If you take combos and platters, it's pocket friendly.

But coming to food and staff. Staff here doesn't even bothers to take your order or what you are up to. I went here on my birthday, my friend asked them to arrange a small cake which they were unable to. Again, she asked them to bring brownie n just decorate it with icing as they had brownie in there menu, they failed to do so even. Ultimately, we left the restaurant n went to another. Not a very good experience.

Located just opposite to RDB Boulevard is this place, shortly also known as OSL. Tried the hookah (gum kiwi), pizza with smoked chicken, sangria with red wine, LIIT and draught beer. Please check out for the offers as they have different offers sometimes, but they are worth trying. The pizza was good, sangria was okay and LIIT was good. The ambience was not too good or bad. It was just fine. The bar counter is well decorated and the customer service is good. It can be good place to give parties and that was clear from the environment. The hookah was not that good.

Their hookah is pretty but the food is decent. I usually have food from TFT (That Food Truck, nearby) and hookkah from here. Also, the music that they play is not so great. They need to work on their playlist. The bar stock exchange concept in Sector 5 is an attractive offering though.

It is close to one of my favourite food joints, That Food Truck. I usually visit this place for Hookkah after having a burger from That Food Truck and this makes for an amazing combination. TFT and One Sports Lounge could do something in collaboration, like if one could order from TFT while sitting in One Sports Lounge, that would be great!

Good happy hour deals but the frustrating thing is that they do not provide complimentary with happy hour booze, you have to order from the regular menu to get complimentary.
Food is decent, Tai Pai fish was delicious.
A good variety of sisha is also available.
Good service and good ambience with comfortable sitting arrangements.
Being a sports bar they have a good number of LED TVs for broadcasting all the sports channel.
Worth a visit and might also turn into your regular bar.

It was navami and we were thinking to hit a lounge bar. There was a tall guy with moustaches wearing a hat standing outside this bar, asked us to pay 500 bucks per person for entry and which was redeemable. We 10 people hoped there and thought to enjoy the night.
Generally I don't give a restaurant/bar one star, if I'm giving this there is something bad in it. Now pointing the good things they done to us.

1) We entered the lounge bar and they cannot give us a seat, after standing one hour, we managed our seats by ourselves.
2) I asked for kingfisher premium pint beer, one with a black shirt (red highlighted hair) told me, they have finished this beer and we have to take ultra max. Suddenly after 1hr they were serving kingfisher premium to one my friend only. Pathetic!
3) Food was good, so I have given one star, but the services were worst. We have ever seen this type of hospitality in a lounge bar in our whole life.
4) They served tequila, but there was no smell and taste of tequila. I don't know what the hell happened to them.
5) Lastly, the bill came around rs. 8950 and before paying we told to redeem our entry fee as said by them. That tall guy with moustache came drunk and shouted at us unknowingly, told " I am the owner, if you don't give us money, I will call the cops". We even told politely we were not going anywhere, you told us that was redeemable so we told to redeem that 5k (for 10 people) and one my friend was also swiping his card. And last but not the least you were pointing your finger on a girl.

Seriously, if you are behaving like this, when you are into this business, you all are going wrong. I don't know about others but you people lost 10 valued customers and you should apologize‚Äã for this behaviour. Sick of your manners.

P.S.- Not recommended at all. Go at your own risk and expect worst hospitality and a cheap kind of behaviour from their manager.

Zomato please allow me to rate this place a big zero. Worst experience in my lifetime. 

Ambience - from outside before entering 3/5
Ambience- after entering 1/5

Behaviour-0/5 

The owner of this place doesn't even know how to behave in a human way. I have seen them to misbehave with everyone as they were dead drunken.

Not at all a place to visit.

I had to rate 1 out of 10. Bcz der is no number less than 1. They says they wont serve only hookah. Means people who dont drink or people who dont want to drink cant go there. If this is the rule. Then they should write it in capital letters in the main gate only that no hookah to be served if there is no order for liqour in the table. Worst place ever went. Even the staff dont know how to attend customers

Once in a while when you bevome a party animal and you want to unleash it, one sports lounge is the place. A cozy smooth pub where you can hang around as couple or group, one sports provide you with all the amenities. Small cubes are arranged for the couples at first level along with single bar stools near bartender for individuals. Lounge for large groups and an isolated room for people who want the silent ambience. Variety of cocktails at reasonable price with a stock of hoegaarden beers add to the stock. Hookah is available at different flavours which allow you to explore. Surround sound system hits you on the beat and make your feet dance to them. Though can't comment on food as we had only drinks and hookah.

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. So we randomly ended up here as we wanted to have some sheesha around 6pm and surprisingly we had a great time. Didn't have much just fries, sheesha and a few pints.

Ambiance and theme is kind of like bar stock exchange, live match going on the big screen, dim lights just the way I like it.

Weird thing is that the waiter won't talk to you as you are a girl, this is something that I noticed so I asked him if you have Bira available and he told to the 'guy' with us that it's not there and thn my friend told me and thn I asked if you have Budweiser again he did the same thing but this time the Anwer was yes. I don't know what his deal was but I didn't really like that. So do take a 'guy' along if you visit one sports lounge.

Photos without flash, sorry guys my bad.

Hearing a lot about brunch combos at an unbelievable cheap price we headed towards One sports lounge on a Friday afternoon. They have separate place for hookah, thumbs up for that. But they turned us off as they said beer was unavailable. We ordered nonveg Chinese combo and nonveg pizza combo. The quantity was ample and quality was impressive. We specifically liked the chicken wings. The peri peri pizza was thin crust and a bit too hard. Another good thing to mention, we loved their decor. Definitely gonna come back when they have varieties of drinks to serve us.

It's located in infinity benchmark opposite of RBD Cinemas. It's the perfect party oriented and chill out restaurant with loud music, dance floor and live sports screening. Mexican and Italian food are better than Indian n Chinese. There is a particular inside the restaurant which is little wired because in both the subparts they are serving the same. One amongst the subpart, either there is no staff or they are standing on your head because the space is too small. And on the other part, the area is so large and music is so loud that u have to call the staff several times. Also many times the chef was coming and giving the food to the staffs. I think they should rearrange the sitting and increase the staffs. Otherwise it's a nice restaurant to chill out n  have hookahs n drinks with friends.

One sports lounge is located in the heart of sector 5 on the ground floor of infinity benchmark right opposite to RDB Boulevard.This is a sports themed lounge with live screening, a concept which is relatively new in Kolkata.

The ambience and the lighting of the lounge compliment each other.  The  staff is polite and the service is great. The menu is simple but innovative. The dishes in this restaurant are absolutely ecstatic which include Spaghetti, Peri Peri pizza, Murg Malai kebab, Bullet Seekh Kebab and Chef‚Äôs special Chicken Biryani (which is Biryani rice stuffed inside a whole roasted chicken). The bar serves a wide array of liquor , cocktails and mocktails , the classics as well as amazing inventions  by the bartender. Shisha is available in lots of flavours and are decently priced.

This place is great for sports enthusiasts and friendly hangouts. It is fairly popular and is fully packed during the weekends. It is difficult to get a seat during live sports screenings and reservation is recommended. Over all Great quality and scrumptious food with beautiful ambience with a very decent pocket pinch, this place is great to party with friends.

I visited this place last night on a Friday evening and wasn't disappointed to be honest. The alcohol is pretty pocket friendly and the music played was pretty much contemporary with occasional mentions of yesteryear numbers. Quite nicely done are the interiors . Bartenders are warm and welcoming. Had 6 pegs of 100 pipers and Thai fried chicken. The quantity of the chicken I would say was very less although was tasty. If you got whiskey on your mind this is the place to be. üçª cheers

It was a disappointing entry since we were informed by the staff that they were booked from 7 pm and we would have to leave by 6.30. Well, it kind of becomes a hassle to sit down and start having fun and then having to leave the place. Seemed like the place wanted to make a quick buck before getting ready for the evening. We were a group of ten and with balloons being put up around us, we weren‚Äôt complaining. Keeping the time limit in mind, we ordered starters comprising of babycorn and dry chili chicken along with our individual drinks (they work like a stock exchange, but when its not too crowded, it gets confusing ordering the drinks). The food was standard as was the service. If it wasn‚Äôt for the service,¬† I don‚Äôt think we would be here at all. Won‚Äôt really want to go back anytime soon.

Well, some positive word-of-the-mouth and I could not hold back myself from visiting this place!

A sports themed caf√© ‚Äì pretty much a newbie in the hustles of Sector 5, conveniently based nearby the RDB Cinemas! Someone opined about their great food and I stormed into this place to taste their offerings!

The catalogue prices might seem exquisite, but they do offer combo meals to attract more office-goers! I opted for their Veg Chinese combo meal ‚Äì priced at Rs. 209 /- (A.I.).

Ambience is pretty much great ‚Äì as you find in a typical caf√© ‚Äì what does catch your attention is the SENSEX-styled prices of hard drinks displayed ‚Äì do visit them to see it! They do have separate seating arrangements for hookah and non-hookah clients to increase convenience!

The Chinese combo comprised:-

(i)	Crispy babycorn:- Quite crispy and tasty

(ii)	Veg fried rice:- Great presentation ‚Äì decently chopped vegetables -  fine on taste

(iii)	3 pieces of Manchurian ‚Äì they call it the veg coins in hot garlic sauce ‚Äì this was pretty ordinary although, gravy was very tasty!

Service is fine, they seat you at the sofas designed with newspaper cover. Since the IPL fever is on, they do have some IPL-theme decoration as well. Size of the place is huge and overall, a great place to hang-out ‚Äì RECOMMENDED!

This is not a lounge in any way. It is a bar stock exchange with loud music in background. the ambiance is nowhere near to a lounge. For some unknown reason the exchange was not open and we were not sure about the prices of the drinks. The drinks menu does not have any price on the list. You have to ask the waiter for the price of each drink. The drinks are overpriced for no reason.¬†
The food is average. The hookah is also good. The service is poor. The waiter cannot hear you or pay any attention for the customer.

Sadly Pubs would never take Zomato or the customers seriously. Where as MMT or Goibibo plays much important role to make sure that the guests are treated in the right way. Noone would bother about the reviews when it comes to PUBs.

Very conveniently located in Sector 5, Salt lake. Just opposite to RDB and Barbeque nation. Interiors are good and there three seating options available which you can choose as you with to. One negative thing was sofas were good but the chairs with the tables weren't very comfortable to sit for long. Alongwith drinks, we had ordered Tai Pai Fish which was tasty but the Murg tikka wasn't that good. Overall a nice experience. :)

Located just at the heart of office hubs, this sports lounge is one of the regular hopping places for office goers like us. The place has a pretty cool ambience, pretty decently priced and friendly waiters. The food is pretty good as well, though we mostly take starters that go with the drinks well. But yeah, the kebabs are pretty well cooked. But the main thing the drinks, a bit high on the pocket, but not really that upto the mark, especially the cocktails. Overall an okayish place to hang out after office.

Have been to this place twice till date, but the second visit was quite memorable for me more because of the offer that was going on during those days.
We had ordered a chinese platter, a pizza platter and a cocktail along with soft drinks. Finally we ordered a dessert which was really good.
All of them were quite satisfactory.

I went to this place a couple of months back out of curiosity. First on a Thursday they told ua that they will not serve alcohol which was a huge let down. So before you enter you need to make sure whether they will serve or not with the security otherwise it will resuly in an embarrassing situation.
On a different day day however I didn't face such a problem. The food is kinda ok, nothing special. Quantity wise its not that great though. However the biggest problem with this place is they won't give you normal water and you have to buy a Rs. 10 bottle for a whooping Rs. 35 which is absolutely ridiculous.
Ambience wise its pretty good with live matches and music going on.

Well not good management, i was there with 2 of my friends and wanted a seat, they said currently we have 2 seaters . I asked them we will seat n wait there nd as soon a 4 seater is empty they can shift us there. The manager said if any seat is empty we would first ptefer a batch of 4 person and if they r nt there then only we will give u that seat. Shame on them.

Amazing place to hangout with friends. Great ambience. Large screen showing IPL matches and videos and DJ were good.

FOOD: Simply awesome

Recommend Dish : Fish Irani, Kungpao Chicken, Garlic chicken

Staff: Amazing service

Concept of Bar Stock Exchange is good but sometimes people get confused as drinks rates keep on changing.

But as a whole great place to go ahead with.

HIGHLY recommended

This restaurant should have been given 4.0 but I lowered the rating because of the absence of good crowd after 10pm. We are young and we do expect crowd running in on Friday's night but it was not there.
Leave it aside, DJ was superb, hookah was good. Though they tried to hard to be like BSE but failed as the alcohol prices were too high. They need to keep a check on it.
Everything was fine and can be think of while going.

Ordered tikka which were good
Hukka was good too
Found it empty on a saturday night which maybe due to the average taste of food served here.
Food wasn't bad. Wasn't great. Just about average.
Though the decor was nicely done

I really wish people took more care employing good cooks n improving the taste of the food rather than spending all their efforts on the decor of the restaurant

This guys didn't provide me normal drinking water even after repeated request.They only sell packaged drinking water and charges atleast 4 times than the normal price.A 10 rupee water bottle is priced around 50.I have raised a complain in consumer forum ,as this is totally illegal to sell water at such rates as per Supreme Court.Even if they are selling it at high rates atleast they should offer their guest normal water and not misbehave and force them to buy mineral water.

One sports lounge is located in the It sector of Kolkata. It is located bang opposite Rdb Boulevard.
This relatively new kid in the house was a surprise.
One sports lounge has two seating arenas one where you can enjoy a loud music and one where you can sit  in peace with your loved ones with out the music.
They generally play bollywood and punjabi songs to pump up the atmosphere.
The place has comfortable couches and amiable waiters. The concept of the bar stock exchange has been implemented here which is a good deal.
This place is recommended for a quick drink with your mates. :)

Was lucky to have a server like Irfan who was really helpful and suggested really nice dishes. Ordered a Murg Malai Kebab and Cheesy Grilled Breast Chicken. For drinks had a Bira beer and a Kulfi Shake. The chicken items were really nice with the meat being soft and cooked to perfection. Overall, a really decent place to chill!!!

I usually do not start a review with negative comments. Here the music was extremely loud. You'll ask me how does that makes a difference? Well it did, since the music was being changed frequently. You'd say again, that's how it should be. What I mean to say is that, the music was changed in such a manner which made no sense and it felt as if the DJ( i hope he was one) did not have a clue about which songs to play. It changed abruptly and it was not pleasant at all.
Also it says here dance floor, right? Misleading. They did not allow us to dance. I have no idea why though. Food was okayish, nothing awesome. Beer was cool.

Not going back again. Sorry.

Honestly speaking, we were passing by this place one fine afternoon when their attractive happy hours offer caught our attention. We decided to give this place a try.

The vibrant ambiance, the rather loud music and the giant screen set up a nice backdrop for a cocktail or two (or three!).  The cocktails were pretty decent too. The LIIT was well made. Strong and impressive. The Mojito was refreshing.

But then that's where most of the good things about this place kind of ends.

We at Hungry Hallows are on a pizza trail looking out for Kolkata's top 10 pizzas and hence decided to try their pizza. We ordered the Lamb pizza which was supposed to have broccoli, olives and asparagus with roasted cumin flavoured lamb. It was an interesting combination which we were rather skeptical about ordering but ordered nonetheless out of curiosity. When the pizza finally arrived, our apprehensions turned out to be correct. The pizza was weird and plain simple bad. 

To make matters worse, we had asked for a glass of water and the waiters blatantly refused saying that they do not serve plain water. This we found pretty cheap and rather unacceptable. 

Overall yes this place has a nice happy hours offer and decent cocktails. But the food was bad and the service disappointing.¬†
Not one place we would be going back to anytime soon.

The food and the service has been good but the place is too noisy. If you want a place where you can sit peacefully and chat with your friends, I wouldn't recommend this place. But if the sports screening, the noise from the table beside you doesn't bother you much, you can definitely give a try. The interiors have been done well.

The place and ambience was fine. However it wasn't upto the mark as per its surrounding restuarants and hype. The hookah options were limited and not too great with a bit smoke restriction and flavour wasn't being Fletcher untill coal change, which is wrong. The food in starter was good. However the main course was a bit raw and cold and chicken dishes not cooked properly. 

In terms of music, the dj was good. However again the music system bass was sad 80% of the time and quality in higher pitches was a bit hazy. 

Their system of bar stock was a good idea. They need to capitalise on that. Cocktails were good but not too great.

Stationed next to 10Downing Street this place runs some amazing offers even during the weekend! 

We ordered three starters and almost 10 different drinks coupled with a hookah and we were billed for something around INR 2000 which was comparatively much less than other lounge/pubs. 
Having IndvsEng ODI on that day was icing on the cake. 
The place serves good food, rolls nice offers and has a comfortable ambience too. 
Service was good too.

Located at a very prime office location in Calcutta, Sector 5 (Opposite side of the RDB Complex), One Sports Lounge is nice place to unwind after work. The ambience is nothing too fancy but like any other sports lounge. The choice of music, cordial staff, quality of food, mixing of cocktails and hookah are all winners! Special mention would be for LIT and Mojito which were very well mixed. The pizza was absolutely yumm! On the shakes end, their Kit Kat shake was good. Overall a good experience!

Ambience - Great Ambience and sufficient seatings.  

The Place serve Alchohol and hookah both and has wonderful offers 12-6 except mondays and Thursdays.  
The stock exchange theme has made the place a visit in a week.  
Food- 

Lamb wrap -  Good and fitting.  

Chicken Lasagna - Excellent. Very few place can make lasgna up to the mark.  This wont disappoint you. 

Chillin Fish- Again tastes Delicious,  very well tossed up and served well.  

Hookah was very good and has lots of varieties.  

Service was very good  and attentive.  
Pocket pinch was reasonable.

This was my first visit to One sports lounge. Ambiance is nice. Loud cool music. This made my mind to give 3.0 rating. Coming to food... It's above average. Not too good and not too bad. 
I could have given 4.0 rating if the service would have much better. For every small things we were calling the guys and had improper response. No napkins, no water glass, no cutlery, etc... This needs to be improved. 
Price is above average.

The one thing good about the place is the decor,period. Kolkata has been longing for a sports bar for ages,I had strong expectations for this place but was disappointed like always! It's a sports bar. It would be appreciated if they kept it that way! They've been trying to put everything at one place, a bar stock exchange, live band , live sports screening but fail at each. It seems to be a dumb idea when 70% of your audience is interested in a high profile match and then there is a live band playing. Thus, keeping the sports enthusiast inside of me still unsatisfied.
Now,the food I only had the chance to try the chicken wings which seemed undercooked. The hookah was midocre. The service and staff weren't responsive either. Bad experience,there is still time and room to improve!

A very well nice and tidy place with a very good ambience. Even the idea of bar as a stock exchange is very exciting and new as well. Now comes the quality of the place while rating this place. To be true there is no difference between this place and any other lounge bar. Like nothing is special. Like as I entered I felt very good and was in a thought like I will be getting something extra ordinary but then again it was all the same except for the bar stock exchange. Even the quality of the food I took like the stuffed chicken breasts and the lazania was not atall what I thought it to be. Even the cocktails we ordered was not special.
I asked in the very beginning for the special item of the day but the waiter couldn't help. 
Yeah, in short a nice place you can visit but then again for one time only.

This is one of the restaurant cum bar cum hookah lounges located on the ground floor of the infinity building opposite rdb...as the name suggests, the decor comprises of the framed pictures of the reputed sports persons..they have 4 tvs in the bar area showing different sports channels and 1 large projector screen playing bollywood and other music..so u can just hop in there wid ur girl on a match day and watch ur game while she enjoys the music...the seating area is somewhat average,but the place is tidy and well maintained..As far as the food is concerned, we had ordered one of their signature dishes 'paneer jalwa' and a peach flavoured hookah.
well,i have no complaints about the hookah..it was really good...as far as the paneer is concerned,it did not live upto our expectations and tasted monotonous....the paneer could have been fried a bit more..the description had a mention of cheese inside which we could not spot even in a single bite..anyways it was okayish....however the service needs to improve and staffs need grooming..specially on how to respond to customer's queries...on the economic end,i would say it is quite a pricey place... however i enjoyed the evening there and would definitely recommend this place as this is one where you can really go to and spend a great time with your inner circle..

One of my fav place in town. I love their food, great taste and amazing quantity. Recently i tried their chicken steak, chicken ala-kiev, fish &chips, grilled garlic chicken, pina colada. I loved it, the fish and chips is just too good. Price is very much affordable. Overall a good experience.

Good hookah and starters will entertain your taste buds. Ask for the long filter, they r so much fun.
Alcohol is not available everyday, we ended up twice on dry days for the pub. We ordered prawn skewer and paneer tandoor. The presentation was as good as the taste. The prawn cud have been a bit more softer but the crispy outer coating made up for it. The paneer was delicious, only three round pieces, along side mashed potatoes and sauted exotic veggies. 
Then came the crispy chilly baby corn, which was a soar disappointment. In taste and texture. Go for the special things in the menu, they make it better. The garlic stir fried hakka noodles was too spicy so a spicy sign shud be indicated in the menu. It was fairly alright.

Located bang opposite RDB Cinema in Sector V, Salt Lake.

You enter through a corridor of neon red light and that for me was the main punch of this lounge cum cafe dedicated to sports.

Comfortable sofas and seats with a ultra modern neon light slick decor. Although dedicated to sports, the decor doesn't show up much of sports except for the TVs which show only sports channels.

But it surely is a very stylish place to be in.

Coming to the food, I had ordered a choco jane shake which is one of the best shakes I have had off late.
Fish Irani kebab which was recommended but it was a nrml masaaledaar kebab which tasted good.

Cheese grilled chicken up next and that stole the show, super cheese melting on succulent chicken served on a bed of mashed potato.....to much of foodgasm in one plate.

The staff are nice and service is prompt.

Cost, could have been a bit more relaxed.

Worst behavior from the staff. Went in to inquire about the offer they had on liquor, they handed me a Xerox which had the details. I went out with it when the waiter asked me very rudely without any reason to return that Xerox. I would have been there this weekend but not anymore.

Loved the long island tea probably the best I ever had and will go back just for that. Only one loud cry for help please play football or sports related matches on that big screen on game nights coz u name it as a sports bar. #LongIslandTea is must #Hala Madrid

Had been there twice. I personally didn't find the ambience quite interesting. The food was average, hookah is good, service is good, but seating arrangement and the area are not quite appealing. They do run bars on Fridays, Saturday and Sundays.
If you have a quite big group, then this is not your place to be.
Overall i would suggest you should short list some other places too.

Downloaded this app only to rate and give reviews about this particular place 
It's mandatory here to give at least one point
You have no other options 
Let me tell you about this place 
Well decorated 
If you feel hot here don't worry Leakage from Ac will make you cool, you can have shower in there too.
Regarding overpricing 
Well it tops 
If you feel that you are super rich ( bambaanis child) 
Come here 
And enjoy life . 
And last thing 
Bill amount was rs 2200 n after adding tax n bla bla shits 
It came across 3003 
Over that they believe in debiting twice of your amount 
Because that card swiping machine 
Is very good there 
If you ever visit to one sports 
You need to ask manager to show there machine it's very unique . 
And the important part 
After trying several times 
My card got blocked . 
Demonitisation gift from one sports lounge .
That's all

I haven't had a good experience it One Sports Lounge.

Had gone there the other day I guess when some matches were going on. It was half empty. There were enough of seats for people to sit but then they wouldn't let us sit for one hour without us paying them Rs 1500 or 2000 per head. We weren't interested in the matches as well. There was no crowd plus we weren't getting to sit without paying a huge sum. They had asked us to sit in the inner rooms but we weren't comfortable when we tried sitting there.

We stayed there for like half an hour trying to convince them but to no avail.

Finally we left.

Based on the Ambience and however we felt that day, would rate One Sports Lounge a 3.0

Not a "sporty" lounge at all...I personally felt very claustrophobic...my legs were getting stuck under the table literally...it was hurting...service was not up to the mark...
We just had chicken nimbu kali mirch kebab and chilli garlic fried noodles...the kebab was good enough but we dint expect them to serve just 2 pcs of kebab...and the noodles was extremely dry...it had the consistency more like fried maggi...

I went to this place last week with my old college buddies. I must say its a very good place for hang out with friends. Hookah is available and they have also started ¬†Bar Exchange. So far I know it is the 2nd Bar Exchange in the city of joy after Sisha. ¬†Foods are really good according to the price quality and quantity. They serves large lamb pizza at only 300 bucks. I must suggest to take 'Gondhoraj Chicken', which I felt a unique combination with JW Black Label.

Pros:
+ Location: It is situated just opposite of RDB at Sector 5.
+ Good Ambiance¬†
+ Loud Music & Giant Screen for Live matches
+ Very Friendly Waiters and Good Service
+ Good Food with large varieties of imported drinks
+ They have an App from where one can check the live price change. No need to look at the tv screens for the price change.

Cons:¬†
- They don't serve any Premium Whiskeys like BP, Antiquity etc. I feel, it makes the lounge costly for the college students.
- ¬†The trading process is not good at the Bar Exchange. Once the price has changed, you will not be able to book the drink instantly. You need to call the waiter, the waiter will take the order and then he will go to the billing section to enter the order in the system. In the mean time the price may hike again and you have to pay the hiked amount. Hope they will soon make this process more easier, like providing a tablet at every table so that a person can book directly.

Among the list of all new lounge in sector 5, one sports lounge is good to talk about. Place is small and cozy but kind of shaddy. Good place to enjoy hookah with its smoky atmosphere.  Food was above average. I liked the pasta. The mocktail list is good. Menu variety should be increased. I liked the music played on the cafe all the time. So yes one can try out this place but it needs to improve in order to compete with other good cafe in sector 5.

Food: Ordered chicken peri peri pizza, oreo shake and chicken pasta. The pizza and the shake was really up to the mark! Must try. And about the pasta, although it tasted good, the garlic bread completely sucked - felt like having a toast biscuit quite honesetly.
Ambinence- great music and live sports! Too good.
So good food in a reasonable price.

This place has one of the best interiors...... This was on my checklist for a long time. My friends and others had given great reviews for this place. The place has a great ambience. It gives you the feel of being in a full blown sports bar sans the alcohol. The alcohol needs to be introduced real quick. Was in the mood for hookah along with my fiance.

We ordered the Elaichi and mint hookah in milk base, the gum supari with mojito base, the Pasta Aglio Olio, The sauteed Mushroom and the lemon ice tea.

All the preparations were really good. The hookahs were a bit strong, the sauteed mushrooms were delicious. The Pasta was really good and in my review competing with the Pasta Aglio Olio from Bikers cafe.

All in all had a lovely meal and a lovely evening.

This sports lounge in the city is one of a kind. Big screen, small everywhere around streaming live sports channels, sometimes playing EDMs, Desi songs videos. And I guess they are going to add bar stock exchange very soon, as soon as they get the liquor license.
We ordered a double flavored shisha, shroom penne, garlic bread with cheese, a kit kat shake, and another drink (forgot the name, it had a taste of coconut, and it tasted good). I have been here many a times as it's very near to my office. I keep visiting here for their lovely offers on hookah, food and drinks together!!
The pizza they make taste very good, a must try for the pizza lovers.

This place is pretty decent if you're looking for a late hangout and are in a large group. The ambience is really good. The prices, although not reasonable, are not too high either, when you look at the taste and quality. The pizza is undoubtedly one of the best I've ever had, and is simply amazing. I wouldn't recommend the Chinese though. I guess this place is worth try, but even if you decide not to, you're not missing out on much.

Was searching for a nice place to have a good food yesterday .Me and my friends decided to visit this place.The outlook of the lounge attracted us.At 1st when went inside we whr not too sure abt the decision.Thought of ordering 2 starters then go some where else.We ordered a tandoori platter and pizza spinachi from there menu.
The service was prompt.The moment we tried the first item from the platter we were taken aback bt the taste and freshness.The accompanying mint chutney i think was the freshest i have ever tasted(other than at home).All three of us wr very mucj impressed with the quality of food and freshness of ingredients used.the pizza was also very good snd even the portion size was good.
All in all it command s a 2nd visit.
The only turnoff was the loud music.

We took 2 combos one was with two cokes one shisha of double flavor of ur choice and one large pizza again of our own choice. This was really great and we also took the Chinese starter combo that  comprised of 2 mojitos ....

It is situated near to RDB and other hookah places such as chai break and others are all closely linked so its a pretty tough competition. It was a bit empty when we entered, around 1pm. The interiors are nice, just how a sports lounge should be. We ordered pink lady shisha and dry chilli chicken, babycorn and fries. The good were good, I liked it. Even the services are nice. Hope to come back here again soon.

So, its the one sports lounge which is going to make big in upcoming months!
Have been planing to go to this place for long, as its just behind my college and finally went here the last day. Amazing lights, nice entrance also the decor and space of the restaurant is well sought. This place has a bar, unfortunately not serving alcohol yet but next month they are starting with alcohol along with the concept of bar stock exchange! So fingers crossed!
They have a big screen and few smaller tvs showing different sports channels, i loved their collection of music, very loud and peppy!
Well, last day we had hookah and food at this place which was very good. We took veg pizza combo, nonveg chinese starter combo and crispy lambs. The pizza served was big size pizza, thin crust and just perfect(we had four cheese pizza). For chinese combo we chose salt and pepper fish, which was crispy coated and soft basa inside. The mojitos seemed more of an iced tea and mint, but tasted good. Flavors of hookah were brainfreezer+springwater and supari+gum, both were nice(Coal change was free).
The lamb was too crisp and i did not feel that i was having lamb,it was cooked nicely, which is good for me as i dont like lamb.
Food price is very reasonable, quantity was also good for 4 of us! Service is nice, but servers has less knowledge about the menu as one of them told us crispy lamb would come in pieces where as it was shredded.
These few glitches kept me from giving this place 5 star, also waiting for one lounge to start with the alcohol thing soon!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This review is after my third visit, when finally the bar stock exchange is implemented, where they have failed to live up to my expectations. There should be an app or more clear view to the changing prices of alcohol, even the servers are not sure of the prices. Secondly we had ordered for sangria but last day all we got was a mixed juice with a hint of red wine. On asking to change, they argued and tried to stick to the point that what we were served with was sangria, later on they changed the drink with a few percent extra wine to the juice. Im really shocked to see such behavior, such poor quality drinks and such casualty of the staff. Hence re-rating this place from 4 stars to 3, I would also never wish to return back.

Nice place to be with friends and watch a sports event. Nice ambience. Many screens to watch sports. Music video screening using projector. It would be great if we could have some beer over there. :p
Been there in two occasions. Hookah was the main focus both the times. First time had brain freezer and second time tried Double Apple. Both the hookahs were good. Stuck in the club menus in case of food both the times. Had Chicken burger, lasagna, Lebanese wrap. All were good. It's a nice place to visit on a matchday with friends to have some hookah and enjoy the game.

Vibrant entry to this place. Private seating area also available. They have small part cabins like seating,also mez seating and bar tools. Biig screen, nice for sports screening. Varieties of hookah. Try spring water, never saw this variant in so many hookah places that have been. Food tastes good. Nice choice of music. They currently have some monsoon combos, which comes cheap..

Chilling scenes everywhere. People out there spend time over hookah, food and friends with music and lighting. The concept of this lounge is based on sports that means everywhere you look you can find different sports are being featured on the televisions. The lounge is quite spacious and the main thing that i liked about the lounge is the lighting at the entrance. The ambiance, the management, the food everything was quite good. So in order to relax over a hookah in the commercial hub, i would prefer One Sports Lounge.

I seldom give such high ratings to places. One Sports Lounge is definitely a good place for a hangout when you're not in a mood to drink but want good shisha and good music.

LOCATION & AMBIANCE:
Essentially a sports lounge, the place doubles up as a lounge in the busy area of sector. The location is right opposite rdb boulevard, so brownie points for that.
The place is divided between 4 sections. Namely the small area overlooking the main bar area, the bar area with projection screens and two inner sections for large groups.
The red lights add to the ambiance, working well with the wooden furniture. Some posters of cricketers and live screenings showing different sports helps build on the theme. The music today was Punjabi and Bollywood.

FOOD:
We ordered for sauteed mushrooms as appetizer and the dish was wonderfully cooked! It was cooked in butter and and cheese, topped with black olives. It was garnished with parsley and was served with a salad which was good as well. #recommended
The sheesha we ordered was spring water rasna and it was made very well.
We tried their quatra pizza and it was delicious! #recommended
Few soft drinks were ordered to help with the pizza. 
The food was amazing!

SERVICE:
The service was very good and they impressed me with their hospitality! Extremely helpful with suggestions and served the food and were prompt with refills.

PRICE:
I found the place to be economical and they are currently having some promos also going. We paid 900 for our afternoon.

Sector v is surely soaring with good options and one sports lounge is definitely one of them!
Best wishes to one sports lounge for successful years and great patronage!

You know something is not right when you enter a place on a Friday night and find that it is completely vacant and you get to choose your own seats, etc. You know something is not right when the number of staff is more than the number of guest and again this on a Friday night. The ambience was good with music and comfortable seating. You can sense that this place will be a hit when there is a major sports event given the projectors and the multiple screens. However for that to happen, it really needs to quickly get the alcohol license. People will not visit a sports lounge for just food and that too average food. Would suggest that you wait till it starts offering alcohol and then this will probably be one of the interesting places in Sector 5.

Right opposite to RDB Cinemas. As the name suggests, totally a sports themed lounge with all kinda sports screening with a big attractive LCD. I really liked their interiors and is a cozy place to catch up with friends.
Waiters are courteous and prompt.
Food is even pretty decent.
Tried Bruschetta which had tomatoes, olives as stuffings and was a bit on the spicey side. It was good in taste.
Would definitely like to drop in again.

I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon with four more friends. Overflowing with redlights, the entrance was quite an energy. The place is divided into many small sections. We ordered a mix of smoothies and shakes, all made good. Oreo shake was okay. We ordered veggie delight salad, good. Crispy mushroom, nice. Spaghetti in mixed sauce, average. Veg peri peri pizza, average. Chilli cheese toast, good. Overall the food didn't excite us so much. Shisha was amazing though. Music was loud and peppy throughout. Service was nice.

banana caramel shake was awesome, berry blast..truly a blast of berry inside your mouth..lovely, the salad was even good to taste, mix sauce spaghetti was even nice, pizza was ok to taste, crispy chilli mushrooms was good.
Paanch paan hookah was good, dense smoke and not that strong.!!

The place is located just opposite to BBQ Nation, where there was xoxo bar. The ambience of the place will pump up your adrenaline. I've not been to many sports lounges, but I feel they have nailed it. The lighting, the giant screens, the loud sound, the bar(they were yet to get alcohol permit when I was there in May), seats everything exudes sporty outlook. But I was surprised to see (taste) how good the food quality was.  Each item had its distinct taste and each of them were yummy in their own way. Not many places can do justice to fish items...but they did.

Pros:
1. Ambience is top notch.
2. Food has distinctive and yummy taste.
3. Prime location.

Cons:
1. Prices are on the higher side, but that's how it is for almost every themed restaurants.

Starting with positive things,this cafe has got some excellent  interiors and ambiance with  a  huge seating arena and fully sports equipped theme.
Now the food...it was good in taste but the variety was just limited in vegetarian section and among that limited variety,many were unavailable.
Atlast the service,which was just below average as the people there dont know any thing about making shisha and are totally confused while taking order for food.

Must visit once to see that excellemt interiors and ambiance.

Located in sector v, this sports themed hookah bar ticks all the checks. Totally worth it. It's as pretty from the exterior as it is from the interior. 

Ambiance : In a single word, sexy. It has a really rich look from the outside and its maintained even after you enter. Golden lights with red leather chairs and sofa adore the lounge. Gives a really rich feel. Well lit. It has 3 seperate sections. Loved how the concept of "sports" is emphasizes where different sports are played on different tv screens all the time. 


Food : We ordered one platter which was their speciality and peri peri pizza. The platter was delicious. One must try the platter. From the presentation to the how it fulfils your taste buds, it's value for money. The peri peri pizza was quite decent. 8 slices for around 350. 

Drinks : Can't wait till this place gets the bar license. We had to make do with mock tails for the time being. Marshmallow and oreo shake were ordered which were both Well prepared. 

Service : Quick and the staff are well trained and courteous. 

Shisha : What is there not to like about it. We ordered the kiwi gum spring water.. 

Pocket pinch : taxes as of now are not currently leviable so our bill for 4 came to 1500. 

I would highly recommend it.

Location:Located in the ground floor of Infinity benchmark,just opposite to RDB Boulevard in sector 5,in the same building that houses Ocean grill and the bytes foodcourt.

Ambience:Dark with red being the predominant colour,with seating arrangements ranging from sprawling couches for bigger groups to smaller seats for couples and also a private room.There are various LCDs screening a variety of sports channels,there's one playing contemporary music videos and loud music reverberates through the whole place. The aesthetics might not be super impressive but they have done a decent job.

Food-We had ordered a plate each of chilli garlic noodles,veg manchurian,one virgin mojito mocktail and a sheesha with Shahi paan+rose flavour.The noodles were delicious but the manchurians were semi-cooked though the gravy tasted nice.The mojito was on point and the hookah was smooth.

Service-Not satisfactory.The servers seemed clueless.Half the people of our group don't smoke sheesha.So we ordered just one for the rest of the three of us but they allegedly had some weird policy that a relatively bigger group would have to order two sheeshas.We would have understood their predicament if there was a line of people waiting for a table but it was a weekday afternoon and there was none.After making them see reason,they finally agreed but our server made some 3 trips to his manager for the same.He wasn't exactly rude but completely clueless which was a downer.But later he come to us and said he could bring the check sooner than we would like to,since we could avail the 25% discount scheme they have if the bill is made before 4 pm.That was a welcome gesture.

Overall it was an average experience and barring a few pictures of sports legends adorning a wall and the simultaneous screening of half a dozen sports' channels,this place doesn't stand out as a 'Sport's lounge'.But could be given a try because the food and hookah are decent and the prices are reasonable in the happy hours.

Went on a thursday afternoon to sip some coffee and have hookah. Overall interesting ambience, contrasting decor. 
Ordered for hot cappucino, quantity wise its better to sip coffee in ccd paying another 20 bucks extra coz quantity was dissapointing for a cup of cappucino which costed 130 bucks including tax. However, happy hours saved my bill of 20% coz i checked out before 4PM. Hookah was excellent.
What was dissapointing in the end is that while we were leaving around 3: 45 PM and it was just 15 mins left for the happy hour to end wherein a couple entered and asked if they order for food now will they fall under happy hour, the reply from the waiter was very sarcastic and unproffesional where he mentioned " If you finish your food within 4PM you are eligible to get the happy hour discount ". There was no need to reply in that way as this aggravated the customer and both were irate. The waiter insisted on his sarcasm and didnt feel apologetic atall. Request the management to take care of this as it may happen with anyone. Cheers!

Ordered Tai Pai Fish, Nachos Bin Salsa, Salt and Pepper Chicken and Salt and Pepper Fish to eat. Food quality is very good here. What I like most about this place is the ambiance. Very comfortable seating arrangements with beautiful interiors. Waiters are very polite and helpful. Service was very satisfactory.

Food served to us was beyond our expectations. Chicken Cheese Kebab and Dry Chilly Fish were lip-smacking appetisers..Not to forget the crispy spring roll. Main course and mock tails were also good. Topping the list was the DJ... He stole our hearts and we danced like mad people throughout the evening.... Yes and as it's name suggests you can see all time sports screening here.... A must visit for party lovers  especially for people who visit Sector 5 daily for office, don't miss this place guys!

Visited the place booked in as private office party. Ambiance is good, brick finished walls are decored with framed cricketers, music is OK kind of, repeatative tracks, we had unlimited drinks (no alcohol) & buffet with decent varieties of items. Hookah is also served in a separate section. Overall,good experience, might visit again on any weekend gamenight

Not a worth place at all. THough they have a wonderful decor and a beautiful ambience with large screen for watching sports match. Only hookah available..the wonderful ambience would make you crave you for alcohol but they dont sell liquor.the music taste of the dj playing music is also not worth for such an ambience.coming to food menu,we orderd crispy chili baby corn whivh was to dry and hard to chew.but the lime cordial tasted good.. This place is located opposite to bbq nation in sector 5

Starting with the location.. this place is situated opposite of RDB cinema.. Easy to find..
Staff is very co- operative... And service is very fast... More over food is also very delicious...

Ambience is perfect... If you going in a big group i would say this is amazing choice for those... Pre book the section thats all you should do..

 if u really looking to go for a nice cafe newly opened... And specially in a group of 10-20 go for this one.... !!

Keep rockin... !!

One of the best hangout for sports lovers in Kolkata, the menu is awesome and the interior and crowd is one of the best in Kolkata..... They have the best in house chief and there menu is amazingly versatile.... You name it they have it in menu and the food tastes amazing compared to any other lounge or hookah parlour. Please try there pizza and pasta.... There service is amazing and very polite waiters.... This place is fuming with youth and IT employees.... Definitely worth a visit and you will fall in love with the place...

A decent place for hookah and adda. The place has a very decent ambience and is very spacious. The food is good too. Hospitality needs a bit more attention because it becomes difficult to get someone to attend the table due to loud music.

Their lunch combo is a great bargain. Even everything on the menu is reasonable. Last time i visited bar was not operational. Once it starts serving liquor i would rate it 5.

We were near Sector 5, and just dropped in.. When we entered.. The place gave us a good feel! Nicely decorated with red sofas.. Match screening n loud music made the place even feel better! But they have not managed alcohol license as yet! 
Hookah was pretty good! Food also was up to the mark! 
Wl surely visit again once their bar license is in!

Only demerit is u guys are running such a good place but y isn't the AC working properly... Despite of telling the waiters several times the problem wasn't corrected...

Location : Ground floor, Infinity Benchmark. Opposite RDB Cinemas.

A recent addition to the long line of caf√© cum lounges category. A stylish logo on the outside which no one can pass without noticing. It is matched with an equally gorgeous d√©cor on the inside. They have not started serving alcohol as of yet but still boast of one of the best designed bar area in town. It has a hive design with red neon outlines in the background. Right at the entrance there is a super large projector that provides 4k video output and is definitely the finest projector setup around (better than Dugout). However there is a flaw in the sitting arrangements. On the lower deck, a person would have to turn sideways to get a full view of the giant screen, which can be discomforting. Also the management should know that keeping the speakers at a high volume level isn‚Äôt a show off but a turn down instead.

Now coming to the food, we utilised a combo deal which had a shisha and 2 red bulls. The hookah was well prepared with evident flavours. However it doesn‚Äôt last long, so I would advise them to use a better quality coal. Along with that we ordered the following‚Ä¶
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Crispy Chilli Babycorn : A dish without which much of our orders are incomplete nowadays. There are 3 things you look for in a good babycorn prep. Crispness. Temperature. Spiciness. This one qualified all three. Thumbs up.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬† Pizza Caterina : All pizza variants available here sound really good, so we had hard picking out a single one. Finally went with pizza caterina and boy it was a great choice. It was thin crust with adequate amount of cheese accompanied by rich toppings of olives, mushrooms, babycorn and jalapenos.

Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt try some other items due to time constraints. The servers are not fully aware of the menu, which is a must. The place has equal number pros as there are cons, its strong hold being the food and ambience departments. Pocket pinch is on the lower side as the menu is inclusive of VAT and they only add an extra 10% service charge. Would have given it a higher rating if the bar was functional. They are soon to come up with bar stock exchange system though. Hoping for improvements soon.

After coming back to Kolkata after almost an year I wanted to enjoy the Sunday night watching the Premier League with friends. This sports lounge was the place suggested to me and we decided to give it a try.
Looks wise its really good, outside as well as the inside. Well decorated and sports posters make it comfortable lounge experience. However, maybe due to space constraint I guess, pool table is missing. Anyway, the projector and multiple screens caters to many people coming here to catch live matches. Sitting arrangement is a bit haphazard, can be re-arranged to create more space. Food is impeccable. Ordered loads of mocktails and starters, non veg platter, burger and pizza. Loved each and every dish. Speaking of service, response is a bit slow, loud music adds to the confusion but I am sure it can be improved. Bar is yet to open. Will be back when I return to Kolkata next time, hopefully to be surprised with the improvements. Overall, a wonderful night out can be enjoyed with friends and relatives if you are a sports or music buff. Also include some English tracks instead of Punjabi Pop to spice up your playlist. Cheers!!

Has an amazing location, ¬†bang opposite RDB cinemas. The interior is well lit and quite chic. Staff is decent and service is quite prompt. They have 3-4 seating areas for different group of people. At times it gives a very crammed up and claustrophobic feeling with tables and chairs all around. Food is decent and is aggressively priced. Since its a new joint , taxes donot apply making it 25% cheaper than other joints. The main area has a large screen and a projector , a must for sports enthusiasts.

IPL season is here, and can't get a better excuse than to visit this newest Sports Lounge Bar right at the hub of Sector 5, where earlier XOXO lounge used to be.. Though my visit was a short one and I am yet to get a complete experience of their spread all I can say is that this place is bound to grow in coming days.. 4k Projections, Multi-Level seating arrangements with a private dining room, a huge lounge area and an elevated private party zone this place has it all..Coupled with a wide array of lip-smacking pub dishes at an Economical rate and a wide selection of HOOKAH..what more can u ask for..
The ambiance is lively, chic interiors with all the modern amenities fits its name aptly.. The service is just spot on..What impressed me was their HOSPITALITY.. Since my friend's Cold Coffee was a little out of flavour they took the pain to replace it even though we insisted not to do so..We tasted OREO SHAKE, COLD COFEE and SHANGHAI PRAWNS and all were perfectly made.. Nothing we can complain..Also VAT is inclusive in the menu itself and they only charge 10% service tax extra..Our cheque was just Rs.605/-(all incl.)..
I am eager to watch the Full Movie now since the Trailer itself is so promising..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

A sports lounge can be safely defined as a bar catering especially to sports fans and typically containing several televisions and often sports memorabilia. Sadly my two visits to One Sports Lounge saw nothing but several loopholes.

A pretty pepped up replacement to the former Buddha Lounge on the ground floor of Infinity Benchmark, Sector V , Salt Lake; The decor of One Sports Lounge will definitely bowl you over. There are red infra reds, Honey comb like bar set up, 4 different seating sections, multiple television screens blaring sports out loud!

Why was it still disappointing?

First, for a sports lounge, this one DOESN'T have a functional bar YET! I don't get the logic of opening a sports bar minus alcohol anyway but what really appalled me was zero inclusion of coolers and mocktails on the menu as a replacement for the same. To top it off there was tea, coffee and milkshakes in the name of beverages! If this isn't an Epic Fail, I don't know what is!

Coming to the food, we ordered Fish and Chips with Tarter Sauce and Spaghetti Bolognese (Lamb) and on request we even got ourselves Virgin Mojito's too.
Let's get to the good stuff here.
The Spaghetti was exquisite with the minced lamb cooked to perfection that you didn't require condiments at all! My compliments to the chef on that.

Now the bad stuff: The Fish and Chips was the worst I've ever tasted- Over fried to a point of looking burnt and honestly more crust heavy than the fish content! An authentic fish and chips ideally is supposed to be beer batter fried served with herbed potato wedges but in this case there were homemade french fries, some prawn chips, a minuscule helping of tarter sauce and some picked vegetables. Not my idea of perfection at all! Sorry!

The Mojito's were refreshing till half glass, then we were left with sugar granules in our mouths! Another thumbs down here!

Coming to the service: Very little staff to cater to so many guests, and as a result terribly slow service. With the music being loud, it was difficult to even catch your server's attention.

The saving grace in the entire dining experience (apart from the ambience and music of course) was their hookahs. Not only were they smooth but flavourful to say the least.

All in all, the Sports Lounge bit is a facade. To be honest, it just seemed like another youngsters "Hookah parlour" cum cafe to me! These guys need a long way to go to attain that status and I pray to God that happens soon enough.

After the old "Winning Streak", Kolkata desperately needs a good Sports Bar/ Lounge for the OLDER sports fans, young at heart!

I usually never give reviews just based on behaviour and not food but this place for ed me to change. During an india pakistan matcxh u expect a sports lounge to be welcoming and accommodate you even with just a place to stand but it wasn't the case here. When me and a friend went in this place we were simply told to leave before asking us anything else. There was clearly some place in the bar so we asked if we could just stand in the bar but the waiters said kindly leave we do not hv place nor do we entertain sitting in the bar. Shocked by the behaviour we just left. I don't think i would get a chance to review this place on the basis of their food as i wont visit again hence this review goes only on the basis of behavior.

Good place, good music, reasonable rates, cordial staff, traceable location and of course good food. Combo meal is economical and seesha is decent. Also, for a sports fan, the big screen and the small screens are just what you need to enjoy a match with your buddies. 4.5/5 because not a zone for photo freaks as lights are too dim.

Flaws Flaws Flaws! As A Regular at this establishment I would like to specify that One Sports Lounge has a lot to improve before it can function with the elites of Sec 5. 
The 100 Seater Lounge, has many Pros, thats for sure but the flaws can diminish them in a matter of minutes.
Situated Opp Chai Break Lounge Sec 5, One is a Sports Lounge & Stock Exchange Bar (Which is still to Start). One's interiors is a rare treat in Kolkata, with Comfortable seating, amazing sound clarity, Projector & Tvs situated all around so one can not avoid it in any way.
 The food is a suprising factor, With a huge menu, and nominal rates, the taste and quality is a major plus.
Now the flaws, Service, as One has left a large Open Floor (Presumebly for Dancing), it gives a emptiness feel even when the Place is completely packed, the staff (around 12 Waiters) are always there to attend to the customers. They are very ill-informed about Their Menu, The Hookah Section, The Combos. After Constant "Ek Second Sir" & "I'll check Sir" your orders are placed and re-confirmed. The Delay is what gets you, Delay in Food Preparation, I have ordered Burgers And Starters they all take a good 20 25 Mins to show up.
The Hookah is a nail in the coffin, takes 15 20 minutes by principle every time. For an establishment that was supposed to come up with a bar stock exchange by 13th Feb, and is situated Opp Chai Break a heavy weight in the industry, you have to at least get a staff that can cope up with your orders now before you even have a bar that has a specific need of being served on time.
The ideal chit chat by waiters around your table feels like we as customers are invading their privacy. 
These flaws should have been inproved within a months of openning that is why i have waited to review this place. But now after 16 Visites the problems carry on. 
Like My Visit On 17th March, after the extra clarifications to the waiter trying to explain my order properly, I ordered a Shisha at precisly 5 29 PM (Capacity at that time : 35 40). At which point a table of 2 entered next to mine, at about 5 32, they probably ordered after that, their Shisha arrived at 5 38 PM. My Hookah was kept on my table at 5 52 Pm. (23 Minutes Later when the cafe was only 40% Occupied).
These maybe minor flaws but the owners need to fix them before they start on a downward spiral and people realise Chai Break is a better option when it comed to Hookah.
Cheers!.

Another new destination in Sector V - "One Sports Lounge". Opposite to Chai Break.
The decor resembles typical American sports bar. You will find 4k protection on giant screen, large LCD TVs, lounge sitting at different levels, loud music, heard stopping sub-woofer, bar-stool everything.
The vast menu ranges from Chinese to American and from Italian to Mexican. Flavoured hookah and separate smoking room for smokers.
We opted for Chinese. The tastes was far from authentic but typical Indo-Chinese. But all dishes tasted good.
Best part - Prices mentioned in the menu card were inclusive of all taxes. They just added 10% Service Charge. So you pretty much know how much you gonna pay.
We went there on Tuesday 1 pm, it was almost empty. Naturally, the service was quick. I am eager to know if they can keep the same service level during busy hours too.
Total check for 3 non-veg starters, 1 noodles, 2 plates of fried-rice, 2 non-veg side dishes and 5 sweet lime sodas was Rs.2430 (all inclusive). Food was enough for 5 hungry-foodie guys.
Not a bad place at all. Only thing is how long they can keep up the good work. Or rather, how long they want to keep this quality and price.

One Sports Lounge located right in front of RDB Cinemas.. This lounge is created for sport lovers with projector screens & television for watching the match intently! But somehow doesnt work coz the music they play is not that happening.. Take a cue from Ground Zero! So this place is hookah lounge and they may get the bar license soon.. 
Looks good the ambience as there are private corners to spend with buddies..
Tried Caesar Salad which was a big disappointment!
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: twas very soggy.. Cdnt entice us!
The Kebab Platter: this platter has varied preparations but it fails to impress us coz theres no flavours whatsoever
The Staff are ok but theres lack of serving and they need to pay attention.. Pocket pinch according to the order is exhorbitant.. Please improve it..
Please post in your views on this one!

Went there a couple of times with friends. The place is located right opposite to RDB boulevard building (Opposite Chai Break).
It's an ideal place to chill with friends, watch a football/cricket match along with Sheesha. On the days when there is no matches, they play amazing music with enthralling videos. The place is pocket is friendly with economical combos available at Rs 599 (A sheesha, 2 mocktails and 2 starters).  The food was good, but not great. Same goes for the Sheesha. No alchohol was a drawback but now they are opening their own Bar Stock Exchange.

It's a newly opened sports lounge in sector 5, just opposite to RDB. It's got a huge screen with projector and also few small LCDs which kind of give you a feeling of a TV showroom. We ordered stuffed mushrooms but couldn't find any stuffing in it rather it was sort of mushroom chilly that also not great in taste. The pizza was also not that great.
We had ordered 5 pan hookah which was pretty good.

Nice place to relax and chill. Very good music. Pizza and Shisha could have been better. Loved the seating and the ambience. A good two hours spent with games. More board games could be added that would suit your name as a sports lounge.

This place deserves all the appreciation. Firstly because of the location, it is right opposite RDB where XOXO lounge used to be. Secondly they have made different sections with different atmosphere and mood. There is a large screen for sports screening and awesome music. Thirdly the food is amazing. We called for an American salt pepper corn. It was lip smacking with indian tandoori flavours. The drinks were superb too, especially the oreo shake.  We also called for a strawberry cheesecake. Though fresh strawberries were missing but you could definitely say that the cheesecake was very well made. The waiters are courteous and always serving with a smile. And the best part is that it is quite affordable. For 2 starters,  3 drinks,  1 main course, 1 hookah and 1 dessert we paid 1300 only. The only sad part is that they not have the bar license yet.

This hookah parlour,a new member of sec 5, is going to give a tough competition to all the hookah parlours and pubs when they ll start their bar section in April. 

* Location : Located just opposite of famous sec 5 RDB CINEMAS AND AT THE GROUND FLOOR OF INFINITY BENCH MARK BUILDING at RDB stoppage, its a massive hit food outlet location wise.

* Decor : After coming across numerous pubs and hookah parlour, I can say that I ve visited probably the most beautifully and smartly decorated hookah parlour in Kolkata. You can have all speciality here : private corners for partners, large couches for friend's meeting, very comfortable sofas for a large group and so on. Large space inside and many sections....all are separated in rooms.
A giant screen over there is perfectly fitted for live sports or good music, even rocking songs also. A separate bar counter is decorated marvellously that I only experience in Mumbai or Hyderabad pubs. Over all I liked the ambience so and so much that I really enjoyed a lot in that calm, cool and at some times electrifying choosy music bits. (rating 9 on 10)
I am sure the interior decorator ll change some sofas when they ll start the bar section cz those sofas are good for hookahs,but not for drinks.

* food : They have a large variety of menu and I was getting confuse what to take and what not. Lastly I ordered: 
1. Parmesan chicken fingers (cooked with a special kind of chicken) (rating 10 on 10)
2. Taipei Fish ( a good continental fishy item, you would like it along with hookah) (rating 10 on 10)
3. Mocktails were very good...chilled and perfectly tasted. I took the orange squash (rating 9 on 10)
4. Cheese salad. A big bowl of good quantity healthy salad, perfectly matched with hookah (rating 10 on 10)
5. Pan rasna hookah flavour (good, smoky and finely made coal) (rating 10 on 10)

* Management : Its a new hookah parlour,not known so much and we went @ late evening 9.30. So the parlour was not crowded and the staffs were attending personally in every tables. Even the manager asked for further betterment suggestion and cordially asked if we were satisfied with the service. I liked this professionalism very much. (rating 10 on 10)

* Price : As compared to an unique and very spacious decor, the price is pocket friendly and quantity and quality of food is very good. If they could remain this much price after starting the bar section, then it ll be a super hit for sure. (rating 10 on 10)

* Special feature : A curious menu card. In every page you ll come across some inspirational thoughts. I liked the best a speech from Md Ali,the boxer " if you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize. " Who knows,may be it is the warning to all sec 5 pubs from this outlet. Quite superb menu card.

* Why recommended : a) For fabulous decoration, new experience for Kolkata pub lovers.
2) For beautifully made continental items....may it be chicken,lamb, fish or prawn.
3) Trust me,its pocket friendly. @priyabrata ganguly

We were looking for a new place in salt lake when we stumbled upon this newly opened cafe. The place is located opposite to RDB in sector 5. I quite liked their decor though the seating could be better. The first thing you notice on entering is the bar (which did not have alcohol yet) . We took our seat and ordered for a combo which included a sheesha, chilli chicken dry and a mocktail. The sheesha was nice and i had no complains, smoke and flavour we very good. 

The chicken was also very flavourful tender and juicy. I really liked it and was almost tempted to order for another plate. The fresh lime soda was well fresh like soda, you really cant go too wrong with it. 

The staff was well behaved and service was prompt. Though we faced an issue while billing as the card machine was not working and they had just one machine. It took quite long to sort that out.

The bill was for about 800 which is decent and quite standard for any visit to a cafe these days. Definitely worth a visit and even more when the alcohol starts( not sure if it has yet)

Finally visited this outlet with my friends. Went to this place on Sunday evening. Decor is fantabulous. Very spacious, lot of people to sit in. The music plays at a optimum volume. Pocket friendly. Alcohol wasn't available, but a huge bar was there. We had ordered for shisha( they were confused about single flavor, saying it double, but it was a single flavor), potato wedges, spinach pizza. Food was yummy. Service was fine.

This new place opened up a while ago so me and my friends thought of checking this place out on a Friday..  And it turned out to be a delight. The place has some real good ambience. Availability of hookah and good food with not much intentions towards completely draining your pockets. The seats could me made better.  The bar section looks awesome. A very good place to be at times of sport events.  Alcohol is yet to come.  Overall I enjoyed it there and service is very good.

Went to this place on Friday and was really impressed by the decor. Availability of hookah at pocket friendly price is the only the plus point. 
The food tastes average. Most of them tastes bad.

But there's a lot of point which they need to work upon. 
The ambience could be bettered . Well no one would want to watch punjabi song videos not hear the cricket commentary . One can just mute the cricket match and play some nice English/Hindi songs and that would be simply great. Coming to the seating arrangement, please do reconsider it. Rather change them completely!
Introduce board games. 
Any restaurant will have regular water and not only bottled water so try serving regular water as well. 
Lastly the staff should let people finish off their food and then they can take away the plates, spoons etc. 
And they only give fork neither spoons nor knives. 
You will have to reach out to the staff for each and every little thing until you yourself get irritated and let go of it. 
Pretty much not expected. 
Never coming back again !

First of all Great ambience!! 
Went there for a team lunch. We ordered the veg combo, non veg combo, pasta, sweet lime, virjin mojito & a hookah.
Veg combo/non veg combo - It had crispy chilli baby corn- It should be named soggy chilly babycorn.
Hakka chow- tasted blant- was served chilled
Manchurian - tasted good but again served chilled.
Cheese chicken kebab - was the best 
Sweet lime - we asked for sweet and sour and were served sour, after sending it back again it returned almost the same.
Pasta - Mix sause penne - was good and hot for a change 
Virgin mojito - never had a virgin mojito as bad as this.
Paneer kebab - It was good.
And lastly the hookah - Hookah was the best thing we ordered.
Final verdict-
Ambience 7/10
Food 2/10
Hookah 6/10
Staff 5/10
If you wanna go please take ample time as they take time for serving.
Would recommend only for hookah and ambience and clicking pics at the entrance üòé

Alright, was hearing about this place from a few friends.... So finally decided to make a visit.... Went in here over a Saturday evening, and i must say the decor is fantabulous... Absolutely apt for a Sports Lounge, very spacious, a lot of different sections to sit in, and a huge bar (though no alcohol). So this Saturday was also supposed to be the India vs Pakistan match, and a giant screen was setup which added to the ambiance and i personally loved it.
Coming down to the food, it was good.. the garnishing and the taste both were pretty good.... But one place i would believe they can improve is on the servicing, that is training the people who are serving regarding hospitality etiquette... Pretty weird if some comes up and tries to take away your drink when you havent finished it yet.. Else a great place.. MUST GO...

Hope this helps !! Happy Munchin :)

Went to this place on Sunday. Ambience was good, although the music was way too loud. They refused to serve filtered water and we had to order for bottled water. The starters and soup were a bit salty. Pizza was good. The service was descent. When I wanted to see the private party area, I was shown the same very reluctantly by a waiter. The sooner these problems are addressed, the better this place will be. Shisha was nicely made, real good.

Decided to...goto this place post..some.reviews on zomato.

Some things that the management need to know 
1) Apparantly... no cash settlement  is alllowed ..and when i heard this...and questioned the peraon..he said " we only accept cards...or only if u have exact cash then we will.accept"..i am still confused
2) i was asked." Do u want your bottled water cold or room temperature?"  When i said regular filtered water is fine...i was stunned by the reply.." we only serve..bottled water..its.as per our 'fine dining' standard policy...
Well i certainly request the management to gothru the f&b rules of running a restraunt !! even the best of the best restaurants Have to serve regular filtered drinking water !!!
3) the food..i ordered an Ala kiev..which wasn't bad...

But then...over all.experience was..below par...and the reasons are my point 1 & 2
33% ratings fr the entire experience.

Visited this lounge a week back, this is the latest lounge in Salt Lake,Sector V, just opposite to bar b que nation. Ambiance and food is too good. If you are a vegetarian u have lot of options to choose, generally most of the lounge does not have much vegetarian selection. But here you get varieties to choose from. Paneer jalwa had showed itz jalwa, it was very nice, veg spring roll and dahi kebab was very good too. Pasta in white sauce was ultimate. Since the bar has not started yet. I tried the Oreo and kit kat shake. Both the shakes was amazing. U can also try varieties of hookah. 
For the non vegetarian jumbo prawn in horse raddish sauce is must try. For main course we had chinese cuisine which was very good.

The projector resolution is very high and the screen is big enough. There is a private area too where 15-20 people can accommodate. 

Food and ambiance is too good. Bar will be starting in another month or two.

An average experience on the first visit at this place. The x factor being that the only lounge in sector 5. Was dissapointed with the unavailability of Pomodoro Bruschetta. Also a bad experience when I got to know there werw no desserts available. So we went on to have Chinese. Thukpa was well prepared but contained a lot of pepper. We also ordered Chilly Garlic noodles and Veg Manchurian: both were good. Giant screen n loud music is a plus point. However they could have made the seating arrangement better. Availability of hookah is also a plus point. 
Needs improvement.

One Sports Lounge, one of my recent favorites, has been creating a lot of buzz around and why not especially with its breathtakingly colorful d√©cor and the wooden interiors with luminous LED lighting. Located in the middle of the IT hub, it is an escape route for many IT professionals after a busy day at work or in between meetings to pamper their taste buds with something new and something different!!! The property brings in a new concept of bar stock exchange, personalized lounge area, and a gigantic projector with live screening of matches which is just another breakout option for us to peep at the score and watch our favorite sportsmen in action.

¬†The food is mind-blowingly awesome and not at all cliche ranging from Indian to Continental, Italian and Chinese Cuisines. It is THE place for all food lovers always willing to try out variety at a very reasonable price. And lastly all this comes at an exceptional service right from the Management to One sports Lounge staff!!!.  A must visit place for we Calcuttans.

This is a recently opened place which has a great new concept and some awesome pub finger food. It's worth a visit as they have something called a live stock on alcohol where the prices fluctuate as per demand. Though you end up spending the same as you would anywhere else the whole concept is worth it. A must visit if you are in the area.

Located in the heart of IT hub, this uber cool lounge is a perfect place to grab a quick bite inbetween meetings or let your hair loose and chill in the evening. 
I have been to this place twice and what i love most about the interior is it has segregation by adding different levels. So, you get a sense of privacy without feeling compartmentalised. The other point which impressed me a lot about the ambiance is the volume of the music. It's optimum for a lounge. You can enjoy having a conversation and also groove to the music. Most lounges gives you the feel of a nightclub by drowning you in music. So i loved this sensibility.
The food is lip smacking. I tried the Tandoori Jhinga, fish Irani and Malai kabab and they were yummy. The staff are cheerful and the service was swift. Very few newly opened places can have everything in place so, I am very happy with One Sports Lounge experience.

One sports lounge is my most favourite lounge since it's open the door for us . Every thing is made with a lot of care, the hard work and sensibility reflects in their contemporary decor. The lounge is perfects in all aspects, starting from their menu selections to the hookahs. We ordered the fish kebab and I must tell it's the best fish kebab I've ever had in a long time . The tandoori prawns were exquisite. The kebab platter was something we all enjoyed thoroughly.
I recommend trying this new lounge in town . Though it's far from my place but I will ensure a visit on a regular basis . Keep rocking Team ONE . All the very best .

There are lot of reasons for one to come and enjoy at this place. 
1. If one is looking to do some meetings. Just come in and enjoy the place with laptop charging points at your own table in a private area over good beverages and food.
2. In the evening if you want to have nice quality time with Hookah u have specially designated booth for such times.
3. Wanna watch a football, cricket or tennis u have the 4K big screen to do so over beer.
4. Ultimate party destination with the best drinks and food 
All in all this place blends in the perfect combination of good food and beverages during day time for your nice lunch or meeting during office hour and the ultimate destination for your late night parties over best drinks and hookah. Drinks and food are well priced and tasty. Specially with the stock exchange coming in, the prices will become more competitive.

One Sports Lounge is a swanky new chill out zone. It's got a brilliant facade, huge french windows. The interiors have been done up well, the brilliant placements of lights give the place the perfect look. There are separate zones created... One for hookah, one for the vip lounge and the main lounge. There's this huge screen where any sport would be a delight to watch. 
The food was awesome, the fish items and the golden fried prawns were especially brilliant. The pricing is reasonable. The staff is friendly and swift. The hookah was also very good. had a good time at One Sports Lounge.

Awesome!!!! That's the word that perfectly describes the place. With honey comb like interiors, electrifying atmosphere lights ...seeing on which one would go wow...!!!this is what Kolkata needed a lounge with great taste buds tantalizing food, lip smacking mocktails and if that isn't enough they even have senses arousing sheesha to magnetize you towards them. I recently on the 5th Feb 2016 with my wife celebrated our first anniversary here. It was a gathering of around 35 people,and by God was the service something special. A team headed by Dheeraj a very versatile individual, had done everything by our means for us to leave with a very bright smile on our faces. The music which they play is wow as well and if that's not enough they even have plans of serving booze in the lounge. Well done Sunny Jaiswal, Rohit Jaiswal and team and places like Backstage and Shimmers watch your backs because here comes One Sports Lounge with all guns blazing !!!!!!!
