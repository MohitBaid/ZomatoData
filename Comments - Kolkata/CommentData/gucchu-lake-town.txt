Ordered a cake and got it as expected. Highly Innovative. Flavour , design , base - everything as per customer order. Owner is polite and helpful . 
Got it delivered in the time promised. A little bit over priced , but it's worth it . Most importantly, the person for whom the cake was gifted , just loved it , along with all her friends. 
P.s. I didn't get to taste the cake yet üòî

Ordered a Chocolate Truffle, baby shower cake.. Was really amazed with its look and finish. The taste did full justice to the mouth watering look of the cake. 
Recommended for all occasions!

The cakes are just awesome with minute details u will ever notice. On top of that u can't find a better person to listen to your every detail u ask for other than the owner herself and she can beat ur every expectation. The cakes are divine, and u will amazed by the choices she offers. And the best part, the intricate artwork on cake will left u speechless. 

In short words SIMPLY WOW!!!
